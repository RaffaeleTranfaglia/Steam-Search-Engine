            "review_text": "UPDATE: In time I see what a strong impression Starseed Pilgrim has left on me, recalling it now and again. Mechanically it's brilliant. I originally gave this game a negative review, but I've since come to reevaluate what the notion of a worthy game playing experience is. My initial reaction, after 6 hours played, was that I had wasted most of those hours on repetition, with no further revelations after those of the initial couple hours playtime. New players should take up Starseed Pilgrim without the expectation of the great puzzle leading anywhere special. Instead, solve the puzzle, play with the mechanics for a couple of hours, explore and enjoy the lonely ambience. Then put the game aside. It doesn't have to be any more than that, not at this price. Enjoy the experience.  ----  Exploration, discovery, mystery, wonder, suprise. Just some of the brand of adjectives that seemingly every review of this game coos. And true enough, the game does have that. For the first couple of hours I was glued to the screen while I solved the metapuzzle that is Starseed Pilgrim. The puzzle is to understand the game's mechanics, and wonderful and clever mechanics they are. The problem: the game does nothing afterwards. In the solving of the mechanics, you've already seen all of what the game has to offer. Those nouns above comprise about 10% of your playtime, The rest: repetition. With its involving atmosphere and great use of sound, as well as said mechanics, I was expecting Starseed Pilgrim to evolve into a masterpiece. What a shame.",

Which is pretty fair really.  Think about playing half life. The game tells you 'this is how you shoot.' Everything else is basically just you finding new guns and using them on things and finding out what you like and how to handle things.",

I still have no ide what it's about and I've been playing it for a long time, and now I own it on Steam, so yeah, even more time spent playing it. Essentially you play as this astronaut looking guy as he plant seeds that make structures that open up new worlds where you continue to do those same actions. It is very sparse, not very much sound, and bizarrely haunting. It's one of those games where you start playing and you just have to let things happen, try new things and discover for yourself. In some respects it is extremely frustrating, in others it's highly rewarding. That may sound vague, but the game itself is rather vague and confusing. I don't know if it's worth 5.99, (if you're interested in it, pick it up during a Steam Sale,) but I enjoy it a lot, and can lose myself in Starseed Pilgrim for hours at a time.",

This is a game that makes you earn your success because this is a game that forces the player to learn. It asks something of the player, and it doesn't bait him with pretty graphics to keep him entertained. It will spit out those who come in without any interest in figuring it out.  For those who complain about lack of tutorial, this game is about writing the tutorial in your head. A tutorial would defeat half of the purpose of the game.  This is one of the very rare games that asks the player to first find the problem that he then has to solve. There are very few of these games that simply drop the player in a box and respect his intelligence enough to allow him to teach himself the rules.  It's all about discovery through creative thinking and a lot of trial and error.  I'm 15 hours in to this game and the revelations haven't stopped coming. There are seemingly unachievable goals -- tasks that are nearly equal in difficulty to Spelunkys challenges. And meanwhile, there are deepening mysteries that the game doesn't confront me with but allows to sneak in to my mind.  I can't get enough. The perfect discovery game.  Many people will be put off. This game is hard. It uses something very rarely seen in games of any kind, and that's inductive reasoning.  Deduction is a common mechanic, but successfully pulling off induction is a very rare and special thing.",

It's the kind of game that gives you virtually no direction, it just throws you in and expects you to experiment. That kind of game isn't for everyone, but if it sounds like your cup of tea, you'll probably enjoy it. The initial confusion does a wonderful job of promoting the themes of exploration and discovery that are at the core of the game. The gameplay itself is very basic: plant blocks that do different things to escape the growing darkness. As you slowly grow your garden of blocks and explore the world, the game reveals that there's more than just your little slice of sky. As for what is out there... well, you'll have to find out for yourself.",

This game feels like a work of someone who thought that the thing artistic, experimental games lack are harshness, repetition, grinding and  lethal fall damage . It manages to be simultaneously tedious and punishing, pressuring and sluggish. It feels like an attempt to illustrate  Do It Again Stupid  [www.shamusyoung.com]  design. It feels like an embodiment of a polar opposite of all nice little touches developers put into games, like straight tunnel after hard puzzle in  VVVVVV , ammo restores accounting for bullets missing from magazine in  Firefall  and ability to finish normal mode and play NG+ on the same save slot in  Defender's Quest . The contrast between the vibe I got from Steam page blurbs, trailer and how it actually plays feels like a trolling attempt.  I admit, I have played it only for a short time - Steam says it was about 40 minutes. I know some games require time to get going - and I really tried to get into it. I tried to reach the first goal, after many failures reached it and the first I like artistic games. I LOVE games about discovering their mechanics. I like roguelikes. This game was recommended to me by a person I'm a fan of, which should have coloured my outlook. Between playing it and writing this review, I even went on an hour-long walk.

            "review_text": "I felt compelled to write a review mainly because I didn't like or hate the game first starting out, and I really wish there was an option to make a review 'Conditional', because your liking or hating of this game will depend greatly on your appreciation of the genre and aesthetic, along with the price attached.  To start, if you don't like puzzle platformers or obscure indie games, don't even bother with this.   Avoiding any descriptions that'll sound like an art gamer's musings, the narrative of the game bounces between vague and understated. The mechanics are simple, though the overall objective is one that will require guesswork to figure out, and even when you've passed the first level, it's still unclear exactly what you're building towards. Success is rewarding, and failure seems often. The feeling of being cheated by game mechanics can sometimes happen early on, but once you start understanding how different seeds work and what things get you 'killed', this feeling diminishes. The uniqueness of the game is intriguing enough that I've returned to it a few times since owning it, picking away at the game's shell in short bursts. It's an easy game to start, toy around with, and leave alone for a while.  This leads me to my final point, and a reason why I lean towards not recommending buying Starseed Pilgrim.   Put simply, the price.   Though six dollars is a modest amount compared to most indie games on Steam, this price just doesn't feel justified to me. I aquired the game from a recent Humble Bundle, where I received numerous other games for about the same price as this game by itself. Knowing that there are other games of equal or lesser price that have a more apparent value-yield going in, I can't recommend this as a safe buy. As said before, the game's narrative is obscure and doesn't offer direction, much less a sense of depth that would make you compelled to dig deeper for greater lengths of time. It's a unique and clever way to spend a few minutes casually teasing your brain with ways to accomplish the game's simple objective, but that's an experience that's worth less than six dollars. If you can pick the game up for half that, I'd say it's definitely worth the gamble, but only if you're one to enjoy puzzle platformers.",
