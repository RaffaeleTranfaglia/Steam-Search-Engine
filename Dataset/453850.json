            "review_text": "*May contain spoilers, not much* A short game about a girl trying to get revenge on the one who killed her mother, but whether she will choose to kill, or to forgive and forget depends on your choices. Maybe the murderer isn't who everyone thought to be. If you expect an exploration game with more action, interacting, moving around...etc. then I don't recommend this. If you want a short story to read with choices to alter the ending, this should be your thing. Dear RED isn't about finding and killing the 'murderer', there's no point in that as the dev already named someone 'Murderer'. It's more on learning who RED is and her dark past that the dev reveals so little about, to feel the bitterness of vengeance and see who suffers from it. You don't have much info or background story to work with but all of the dialogues hint a little here and there, you can easily put one and one together to find out the truth. The game shouldn't take you longer than 30-45 mins to finish. A bit pricey considering its content isn't all that different from the free version before. I got this from a bundle for $1 so for me, it's a perfect price but if you really have some money to spare then this can be a good passtime.",

Needed to be way longer tho, I wouldn't pay more than $2 for it honestly.   Giving it a Positive tho due to the concept and that it looks cool, even tho its short and overpriced.  At least it has trading cards.  PLEASE ADD ACHIEVEMENTS  ",

I will admit I've played better games like this before (To the Moon, Mad Father, etc.) but I really liked the many endings they gave.  There isn't much to complain about, the only thing is, I wish this game was longer. It's just a very short game, but thats really it lol.  Overall, the plot is good, the characters are amazing, their background stories are nice (so just in general it was a good game ^W^!)",

            "review_text": "First and foremost I will say this: 'Dear Red' had something going for it. it definitely had some potential to be a great game--look at the title art, it's amazing!  But... that potential was utterly wasted. This game isn't the worst thing ever but boy, is it bad. I played through the game about 7 times trying to see if I could understand what on earth the story behind everything was but I couldn't. And according to the description of this game, 'Each of your choices will lead to a different result.'  This is a bold-faced lie.  You can say either tell the truth or lie in certain situations and all it'll get you is maybe a bit of extra dialogue--you'll get the same ending. I may also add that my fastest run of this game took me not thirty minutes, not ten minutes, not even FIVE minutes. It took me a solid minute or less to get to some of these endings. There's virtually no objects with which to interact in order to trigger something, and those that do it'll just lead you straight to an ending. The game keeps trying to draw you in with, 'Well, Red's father and the murderer knew each other!' and 'oh well there's more to it than meets the eye~! hurrhurrhurr' but if there is then the game should have A. Been much longer, B. Not just ended after you make a choice not even thirty seconds into the game, and C. NOT BEEN RELEASED. I mean, honestly, if this game was just something someone made to practice different endings in RPG maker, then I would understand! But it's not; this is an actual game that someone is selling and that I paid money for. I hope to god that this is just some kind of early release and that the game will have more content and updates in the future, but something tells me that aint going to happen.  Overall: don't buy this game unless there's been some kind of huge update.",

            "review_text": "The story is absolutely terrible and basically gibberish. I have every ending and it took me 36 minutes. About 10 of those minutes were me accidentally clicking the wrong dialogue option and having to sit through all the text I just read again because there's no way to stop it. A few of those minutes were spent re-reading the dialogue over and over to see if I missed something and that's why nothing made sense. I didn't. Most of the text feels like an early 90's SNES fan translation. It makes no sense and the sentence structure is odd at best and downright incomprehensible at worst.",
