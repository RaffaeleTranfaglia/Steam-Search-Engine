Some of rabid chickens and slugs \\ snails) We have the choice of weapons (machine gun, shotgun, which should be opened for points and points falling from killed animals) Also there is one skin, which is cheaper weapons!  A dynamic game, all you need to do quickly and react differently chickens 'will peck' Music is suitable for this game is 100% + cards  Play fun and exciting. Not for nothing bought!",
