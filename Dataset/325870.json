            "review_text": "What a great little platform game! You can see how much I've enjoyed by my playing time! It's very easy to pick up and play and lose a few hours! Graphics and sound are suitably atmospheric and it runs well altogether. It's fun trying to find all the coins and there is the urge once finishing to play through again on hard or to get more achievements (some are a bit of a grind though). It has cute little trading cards too which are impulsive to attain.  There are a few negative points: can become very repetitive on one sitting some glitching on movable boxes some areas not unlocking meaning you have to restart the level further on things such as moving ledges can be very annoying due to being out of sync The 3 'bosses' are the same and almost impossible to kill the last on Hard setting 2 of the achievements seem to be broken  However if you like cutesy, straightforward fun, you could do lot worse than pick this up.",
