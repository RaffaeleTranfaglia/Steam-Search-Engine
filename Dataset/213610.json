You get to choose from two story lines (Hero / Dark), which each feature three core gameplay elements: 1. Speed levels  In these your goal is to get to the end of the stage extremely fast. 2. Mech levels In these you blast your way to the exit. 3. Search levels In these your goal is to search emerald pieces.  There is also a place called the Chao garden, where you get to raise pets with whom you can play a lot of minigames.  There are some minor issues where the camera can become a problem and cheap deaths may occur.    This was before the memes,8bit nostalgia, terrible consoles, and the wave of shooter games - and when playing Sonic games wasn't attributed with a fanbase of a bunch of autistic, circlejerking perverts who cross it with My Little Pedophile / Undertail / FNAF every chance they get   ",

The only thing SEGA hasn't improved is the limited rings loss when hit and the low 2 second shield provided when hit; Unlike the Shadow the Hedgehog game that lets you lose 20 rings and gave you a 5 second shield when hit.  And the one thing I disapprove is the treasure hunter radar, where its not as good as the Sonic Adventure DX - due to the trickyness like finding a needle in a haystack.",

I love playing as Knuckles and Tails too, those guys are chill in real life. One complaint is that you can play as Dr. Eggman, who in my opinion is the evilest villian in the world, and I think allowing us to play as him is distasteful, much like a game featuring Adolf Hitler as a playable character would be. However, I'm willing to look past that and still rate this 11/10 on speed alone.",

            "review_text": "Every so often there's that one game that you see on TV that looks really interesting when advertised, and looks like it could be very fulfilling that first game for me was Sonic the Hedgehog 2006. Firstly I was 6/7 years old at the time, everything looks different then second off, Sonic was the character that solidified my interest in games so I wouldn't hesitate to get if I could, I did and was not disappointed. I'll explain that elsewhere. Due to being young I never saw SA2 advertised but games within its era made references to it I only understood years later, so you can imagine how felt when I got this and realised that it is some of the best sonic team have to offer.   Sure, it was easy to lose momentum in areas and having to wait to activate the spindash took getting used to but once you got the full set of powers you were almost unstoppable. I know thta people would like another game like this but it's often better to leave things where they are. Yuji Naka's not there anymore and neither are Yoshihisa Hashimoto or a lot of the development team, that vision's gone. It's not impossible since Sonic Lost World PC has shown SEGA are doing their best to listen to fans but a lot of things are better left alone.  Bottom line, Story's great, multiplayer is good every now and then, the character's are fleshed out enough and the gameplay is simple enough to warrant replayability. I know many people find the original cast's voice acting cringeworthy but hey, it's better than mainstream series e.g COD, Tomb Raider, Battlefield and the rest where cusses are warranted every few minutes. Definitely worth a buy if you haven't played the originals.",

            "review_text": "There was once a time in the Sonic series where Sonic Adventure 2 was considered by many to be the best in the series, next to Sonic 2 &amp; S3&amp;K. Critics seemed to be on the same boat as well, IGN back then gave the game a 9.4/10 upon it's release. Although that was back then...... now a days Sonic Adventure 2 is often deemed as the most overrated game in the series, and most tend to be bashing the game.  Including myself, I could never understand why people were saying that SA2 was better then games like Generations and Unleashed which are my favortie main series Sonic games. I have no expirence with the original Dreamcast game or even the Gamecube Port, I have SA2 for my PS3 and PC.  This review will be kind of a rough look see into both Adventure games to see which one is my favorite.  Sonic Adventure 2 is fun just like the first Adventure game, but there both rather rough around the edges, while one might do something better then the other, the other does something better.  Sonic Adventure - Better Music - More interesting Level Design - A more fun way of story telling  Sonic Adventure 2 - Better consistency, lets face no one liked Big's fishing levels even with how short they were, and Amy's gameplay could of been better - Better graphics - Better controls  I am going to say that both games have their issues and positives, so i'll just say there just as good as one another, although Adventure 2 is still definetly fun to play, it could be worse, but it could be better as well.  8.0/10  I don't care for the chao gardens  Tomarrow, Friday July 22nd 2016 will be the announcement for the 25th anniversary title. Will it be Sonic Adventure 3? I have no clue, but it would be interesting to see what will the next title will be. :)",

All of the features found in the Gamecube version are there, except for the Battle features which are in a very affordable DLC. If you played as a child or have never played before, I recommend you grab the game! It does lag a bit on PC, though chances are it will be much less noticeable for most players than for me. ( I have a somewhat older PC. ) Nonetheless, it's not game breaking. Adventure along in a really well made game and have access to the Chao mini-game, which is almost more popular than the main game and very addictive. It was way ahead of its time back in the day in terms of virtual pet games, and even to this day it is a robust, charming, and relevant system that is fun to play.",

If you like Sanic or are a fan of the old 3D platformers back in the late 90's/early 00's then I'd recommend SA2, it has a story that most current Sonic games are scared to touch.

For as long as I can remember I've played Sonic Adventure 2 BATTLE on the GameCube, but I was young and careless so I accidentally ruined the game by leaving it out and the dog stepped on it. Oops. Anyway, I was super psyched when I found out that I could buy and download the game on my laptop, so I did. By the way I am not dissapointed at all whatsoever. One thing you should know however is that this is a steam version of the original Sonic Adventure 2 for DreamCast, and not the GC version. Don't let that stop you from buying it though because it is almost exactly the same. In fact, you can even find Big the Cat in (I think) every stage, unlike the GC version. You can even raise little chao!!!   Little tip though, because this IS a Sonic game it will be fast and a little difficult to control at first with the whole WASD controler Lol but you do get the hang of it eventually. However, when I was attempting to clear Hard Mode with Rouge at Mad Space (raise your hand if you hate that level) I still haven't been able to do the screw kick (I think that's the name of the kick, but it may be something else) to get the last shard of the Master Emerald because it is VERY difficult to make a circle and press the button for 'b' with WASD controls...  Other than that minor detail, it's a great game that had me hooked when I was younger and even to this day. Heck, I've played it on steam for a VERY long time. The three different stories is probably my favorite part of the game along with the chao and whatnot.  10/10 I highly reccomend :3",

I used to hate the Steam-version because it has no controller support, but after I figured out how to play it with my good old GameCube controller I could not stop playing this game.    Some positive things this game features (too lazy to write everything down here):  ► Really good music ► Nice story ► Hidden Big The Cat in some levels ► You gotta go fast ► Doesn't cost too much ► Chao Garden   Some negative things (still too lazy to write more):   ► The camera seems to be buggy some times, so you can't see yourself until you die ► Some graphics don't look that nice ► You have to download programs to use a gamepad, the keyboard controlls suck   After all this is a really good game that just needs to add a regular controller support. It is also good for people who just want to relive their childhood.",

            "review_text": "This is one of the better 3D Sonic games, but it's still not perfect &amp; suffers from its own problems.  Pros -Multiple Characters -Good &amp; Bad Story Lines -Replay Value -Chao Garden -Two Player VS Mode (w/ Battle DLC)  Cons -Camera Problems -Fidgety Controls -Mech Missions  CHARACTERS &amp; GAMEPLAY  Sonic &amp; Shadow the Hedgehog are the speedster levels. You run, jump, spin &amp; Slide your way through as fast as you can. Pretty basic Sonic stuff right here.  Knuckles &amp; Rouge are the Gem Hunters. You go through small open worlds in search of missing pieces of the Master Emerald w/ your Radar. The Radar has been downgraded from the first Sonic Adventure game in that you can no longer track multiple gems at a time. You do however get bonus points for finding the gem pieces that you're not currently tracking. I think this is a good feature actually &amp; it increases the difficulty just enough to keep it interesting.  Tails &amp; Eggman (Robotnik) are the mech riders. These missions are the worst in the game. The mechs are clunky &amp; it always feels like you're riding on ice. The mechs slide around as you walk which just confuses the crap out of me since they don't have any wheels. Their missions aren't unplayable but they are annoying &amp; can be cumbersome with how they control. They play almost exactly like the E-101 robot from Sonic Adventure. You shoot things &amp; fire homing rockets at as many enemies as you can in order to rack up combo points.  You can also find hidden upgrades for each character throughout certain levels. These vary between characters &amp; can give them essential to optional upgrades for completing the game. If you miss an upgrade you can go back &amp; get it via the mission select menu.  The camera system still has problems. It's good in Sonic &amp; Shadow Stages, but the others have some issues. Especially in Knuckles &amp; Rouge stages. The gem hunting stages you need to explore to find gems but the camera is set up in such a way where it will fight you tooth &amp; nail. It puts itself in awkard positions which is especially difficult in tight areas. It tries to follow you in larger areas, but ends up getting stuck behind objects or walls. You can move it left/right but not up/down so if you really wanna look in a certain direction you're SOL. The camera was obviously designed for the Dreamcast &amp; it's limited controller but still, they could have touched it up by now. It's still lightyears better than the previous Sonic Adventure's camera at least.  STORY (SPOILERS)  The story revolves around Sonic being mistaken as Shadow &amp; the Army is now hunting him down. Shadow is released from a TOP SECRET Military Base on some island somewhere by Eggman. Rouge is sent to spy on them while fulfilling her own needs stealing gems. When she comes accross the master emerald &amp; fails to steal it from Knuckles he shatters it into pieces that scatter accross the world (for some reason) in order to keep it from being stolen. Now they're both out to collect all the pieces before the other. Eggman takes control of some super destroyer satalite &amp; holds the world hostage while Tails is in mostly just a support role for the story in that he helps Sonic stop Eggman. It pretty much ends with two Super Hedgehogs saving the world from a sentient bio-weapon created by Eggman's grandfather.  GRAPHICS  The graphics haven't aged well. Character models &amp; environments are blocky just like they were on the DC/GCN. Textures have been upgraded for higher resolutions at least. The game supports 1080p &amp; runs smoothly. I hear there are lots of glitches when running on Windows 8.1 so you may need to set compatibility down to Windows 7 if you experience any issues.  AUDIO  Music is good albeit cheesy &amp; catchy at the same time. I played this game as a kid &amp; I still have that 'Follow my Rainbow' song stuck in my head. The voice acting is pretty bad. The lines are set up for japanese dialog so in english everyone just talks over eachother in certain parts of the story. You have to pay close attention to understand what the hell is going on sometimes. The game uses most of the same sound effects from the previous Sonic Adventure game as well, which isn't a bad thing.  CONTROLS  I found the controls vary depending on what controller you're using. I was first using a Logitech F310 controller but omg was that thing terrible to play this game with. I ended up switching to my old Dual Pro controller, but you need to use x360ce to get that to work properly. The Dual Pro controller works a lot better, since this game was built originally for older controllers the super sensitive sticks nowadays don't work well with it. I advise to either use an older controller or set up your newer analog sticks with less sensitive settings for it to work properly.  The game can also be played with the keyboard but I wouldn't recommend it. It's even clunkier with that than it is with a normal controller.  CHAO GARDEN  The Chao Garden is probably where you'll spend most of your time in this game. It's pretty much tamagachis in Sonic. Much improved as well from the Chao Garden in the first Sonic Adventure. The only downside is that the mini Chao Garden no longer works. It was used in the Gamecube/GBA link where your GBA would download a mini garden from the Gamecube &amp; you could raise your Chao with you on the go. It was a fun little side game that was good if you liked raising your chao.  Here you raise Chaos to be Good or Evil depending on which character you use to raise it. I recommend doing both since you unlock Light/Dark Chao gardens for raising at least one of each. You also get a shop to buy your Chao gifts &amp; even buy rare Chao eggs. It's probably the most addictive part of the game &amp; it's actually the reason why I bought this port. :)  BATTLE DLC  The Battle DLC nets you a bonus 2-player VS mode where you can race or fight eachother. There is no online play, though. It's all local. It's a fun distraction if you've got a friend over. There are also mods that let you play as the Characters used here in the regular missions but you need the DLC for it to work.   The best part of the Battle DLC is that you get extra things for the Chao Garden. It also changes the graphics to look like the GCN version.   OVERALL  There are good &amp; bad Sonic games. This one is still a far better game than the 1st Sonic Adventure, yet it still has flaws that keep it from greatness. I recommend it for Sonic Fans or anyone who wants to experience an older 3D Sonic game that isn't terrible like it's predecessor.  The most fun part is probably the Chao Garden. It's a very addictive little pet simulator. If anything I'd recommend buying this game just for that alone.",

DO YOU WONDER WHY YOUR FANS DON'T ♥♥♥♥ING LOVE YOU ANYMORE? ♥♥♥♥!!!!!!!!!  That being said, I can only describe Sonic Adventure 2 like this:  Imagine ordering a steak. You have one, little juicy part of the steak surrounded by a lot of fat and those parts nobody really likes. Normally, you'd just get another steak, but the part of this steak that isn't disgusting fat is actually SO DELICIOUS that you don't want another one. Also, you actually have to get through this fat in order to enjoy the actual steak part fully, and with a much more delicious flavor.  That's basically what Sonic Adventure 2 is like. This game is considered the last truly good Sonic game, and while I've been pretty indifferent to the Sonic series as a whole, I can see why people say that.  As I said, I've been pretty indifferent to the Sonic series as a whole, but this one inparticular has held a place in my heart for many, many years. Why? It's not because of the somewhat okay-ish Sonic/Shadow levels, where you just go fast. It's not because of the tedious Knuckles/Rogue stages where you find 3 peices of the stupid Chaos Emerald. It's not the unecessary Tails/Eggman levels where you just run through a linear path spamming the attack button to shoot everything in your way, and it's not because of the 2-player mode (I had a Gamecube and no friends growing up. :c) and it's not because of the kart racing, either. It's....    T H E C H A O G A R D E N    It's not very often that a game is praised this much because of a relatively small feature, but it's AWESOME! It's basically a virtual pet game that has a lot of depth into taking care of your Chao (the blue creatures with those yellow balls over their heads) and watch them go through a surprisingly deep life cycle. I've spent COUNTLESS hours in the Chao garden, and I can honestly say that it's worth the $10 purchase just for that feature.  The rest of the game, like I said, is kinda meh. But once you get past all of that, the Chao Garden will keep you coming back, even after you beat the game! THIS is what we want, Sega. Not a barley functional Kinect game with characters we don't give a crap about riding hoverboards. WE WANT MORE OF THE CHAO GARDEN!  4 McLovin's out of 5",

I did it on PS3 and really enjoyed it.  Gameplay can be broken down into 4 parts:  Speed: You're Sonic/Shadow you run through levels. The best part of the game.  Shooting: Tails/Eggman are in mechs and you have a lock on lazer cannon the idea of each stage being how many enemies you can target at once before losing the lock, pretty neat once you get into it.  Treasure Hunting: Knuckles/Rouge fly around contained levels looking for 3 of something. You can climb, glide, dig, it's fun to just run around as them really.  There's also a few mods out that are pretty great and I highly recommend hitting up Sonic Retro for them.  Now for a controversial opinion: Chao Garden sucks. A lot of people will try to tell you the chao portion is something special. It was easily the poorest portion of the game by far. It's tedious, it's annoying, it's not deep or interesting it's a time waster through and through.  Essentially all the enemies in the game drop animals or energy cores that you can give to the chao leveling them up so they can better race or fight. The racing and fighting however are slow paced affairs you have no impact on other than cheering making the whole affair a massive time waster.   In short: Mechanically solid game with an excellent aesthetic, it has a tacked on time waster you need to 100% the game but you can ignore it really.",

However, if you've never played this game before, this may or may not be worth your time.   I'm recommending this because, out of all the Sonic games that have been released within the last decade-and-a-half, this is still my favorite. Yes, I can attribute some of that to the nostalgic value that I'm placing on it, but it's really quite a good game in terms of gameplay. Is it the perfect Sonic title? No. Not by a long shot. But it's still fun.  You have 3 styles of gameplay in this title. First and foremost are your 'Speed' levels, which you have to get through the level as fast as possible. This is the most classic gameplay of a Sonic game that many fans are familiar with. You play these levels with either Sonic or Shadow. Then you have your 3rd-person shooter levels. I feel like these levels are the most taxing and least fun in the game, but the goal is to shoot everything in your path and reach the end of the level. You play these levels with either Tails or Dr. Eggman. Lastly, we have the 'treasure hunt' style of levels, which are actually pretty fun if you explore a little. You have to search for the pieces of the Master Emerald in these settings, and these are played by either Knuckles or Rouge.  The premise of the Chao Garden is to raise your own Chao by giving it animals and chaos drives to increase it's abilities, and effectively make it stronger to participate in Chao Karate and in races. Also, you get to sorta act like a parent to these things, so it's a pretty neat and fun side activity to do while reaching high scores on all of the levels in the games.  In the end, it's quite a fascinating game. The total story time amounts to maybe 4 hours if you know what you're doing and where to go, 6-7 if you're new to the game. But with all of the kart racing, chao raising, and different quests in the levels, you can keep playing the game for hours and hours and still not have done everything there is to do. If you're not a Sonic fan or didn't play this game in your childhood, then it's not for you. However, if you haven't played the game before and you enjoy Sonic games every once in awhile, this is a great title to play, and I highly recommend it.",

The Speed Stages are full of thrill and excitement, from being chased by a truck bent on trying to kill you to skateboarding straight down on a wall, the high speed and adrenaline will keep you going to the finish!  The Treasure Hunting Stages really test you and all your tracking skills, they are yet very frusturating and hard to beat. Luckily it has hot or cold type gameplay, there's a little radar that will tell you whether you're far away from the object you're looking for or right next to it. Or anywhere inbetween.  Then the Mech stages, they are unfourtanetly very forgettable. Not that fun either, it's more like Speed Stages than Treasure Hunting though, sure, there are some fun ones, but mostly very very boring ones.  Also, there are multiple missions for each stage, which let you explore around the stage some more or simply get a certain number of Rings.  There's a really great soundtrack too! Most of it adds some adrenaline to the level, except for the Treasure Hunting levels, at least, not on the Hero side.  Overall, 6/10... really great in some parts, but in other parts, *raspberry noise*. I don't really know if I would reccommend it to anyone.",

So when I saw it on Steam I was like 'Great! I can be joyful all over again!' oh how wrong I was. Using a keyboard to play this game is doable but it's very hard to get used to, the obvious way around this is to buy a control USB thingie, but I don't have one and I couldn't get one yet anyway. So I played as best I could until I got to the Golem boss, this is when I realised that I was stupid for playing it without a controller and that I may be possible of comitting murder. No matter how much I tried, trying to get the stupid blue hog to bounce on the things platforms was near impossible, resulting at me screaming, growling and shouting at the laptop. It got so bad that I was shaking with rage, it was only made worse by the fact I had one more hit to get and I died. The whole time my partner was behind me trying not to laugh as I kept screaming 'USELESS ****, STOP TURNING, OMG STOP IT' Thankfully I did manage to kill the golem in the end but I was shaking that much that I had to end it there.   Do not play this game unless you have a controller, you might just kill someone. The graphics are really bad, but it is an old game. The script is hilarious, Rouge and Knuckles have some of the worst lines in this game. Their flirting is horrific.  However this game is great, I enjoyed it as a kid and I do enjoy it now (When I'm not raging over having to use keys)",

            "review_text": "This game has recieved a lot of flack recently. There are those who say it ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ized what made Adventure 1 great, those who say all the playstyles that aren't Sonic are trash and so forth. I believe that this is one of the best Sonic games out there, and I didn't even play this game as a kid. I STARTED with Generations  First off, the story might seem cheesy these days but for the time it was quite unique and impressive for a 3D platformer to have. Adventure 1 technically beat it with getting that achievement first, but Adventure 2 improves on the now horribly dated cutscenes from the original. The audio mixing is pretty bad, however, and makes it hard to hear the characters a lot of the time. It's a minor nitpick, but the sound mixing is probably the worst part of this game.  As you all probably know the game is split into three playstyles; Speed, Treasure Hunting and Mech Shooting. I won't go in deep analyzing these but to summarize: All speed stages are great except for maybe Final Chase if you're not careful, most of the Treasure Hunting stages are open or small enough to let you explore them quickly and makes the nerfed radar from SA1 a minor issue with the exception of Death Chamber and Mad Space, both of which are simply too confusing for their own right. Finally, almost every single Mech Shooting level with Tails is awful while the Eggman levels are simply mindless fun most of the time, except for Sand Ocean which is a bit heavy on careful platforming and can be hard since you don't have the hover yet.  Finally, what really sells this game for me is the replayability. Let's list off the things you can do in the game, shall we? -Beat the Hero story -Beat the Dark story -Beat the Last story -Replay the stages to get better times -Play 5 missions on every single one of the 32 stages and get the highest ranks on all of them -Raise your chao into either a hero or dark chao and pit them in combat or races against other chao -Play the multiplayer with all three+Cars playstyles, including online play if you use mods (Requires Hamachi!) -Check up on the online global leaderboard (mostly hackers and modders) or your local leaderboard of friends who own the game as well -Write a way to olong review of the game you probably love after doing most of the above features.  That, and the game is just insanely fun. As someone who first played this game in 2016 and has heard nothing but negative reviews about it, I can say that it is one of my favorite Sonic games ever made.",

On top of that, the level designs can be a bit frustrating, and not to mention, repetative, but at least the Sonic / Shadow levels are fun.  If you have a Dreamcast / Gamecube, get this game on those consoles. It's well worth the two or three dollars it'll cost. As a PC title, go ahead an pass.

The plot doesn't matter. We start with sonic skydiving for reasons unkown pursuing a 'fake' hedgehog... who's clearly a hedgehog.  The removal of SA's hub world is a huge pro, sonic was always more fun streamlined. Sonic stages are exhilirating, Tails's is decent and not a hack redo of Sonic stages like in SA. Knuckles stages are frustrating.  Music is fantastic, pretty much the one thing Sega has continued to shine in.

After that, the game quickly becomes terrible. The tails/eggman and knuckles/rouge stages are completely boring, filled with tedious platforming and combat. The Sonic/Shadow stages, while sharing the same complaints, are better designed than the other stages. However, they also have the homing attack, which will either function or screw you over. Every time I died I felt it was the game's fault.  There are also cutscenes within the game, which have some cringe-worthy voice acting and dialogue tied in with out-of-sync talking animations. The game's plot, for some reason, has some dark themes that you wouldn't expect from a sonic game. The soundtrack is the only redeeming feature for this game, having some memerable tracks if you aren't playing a knuckles/rouge stage (seriously, hip hop?)  However, I haven't even talked about the monstrosity that is the pc port. First off, the pc port, despite saying so in the controls section of the launcher, does not support xbox 360 controllers (I assume the same goes for every other gamepad), which means you have to play through a 3d sonic game without a gamepad. I've also encountered many minor bugs along with forum users suggesting that there are major bugs that I haven't encountered.  Pros Soundrack (Trust me and we will escape from the city!)  Cons Everything else  In short, even if you enjoyed the gameplay as a kid, DO NOT BUY THE PC VERSION!

            "review_text": "Sonic Adventure 2 is one of my favorite Sonic games up to date. It was first released fot the Dreamcast on the 1st June 2001. Since then it has been a fans favorite.  Pros:  - Overall nice plot - Long playtime - Chao garden - Smooth controlls - Great soundtrack - New likeable characters  Cons:  - Side character stages are only average - Clunky camera - Not well ageing graphics - No online multiplayer or chao trade   Story:  This game takes place after Sonic Adventure. Eggman releases the ultimate lifeform 'Shadow' to help him steal all the seven Chaos Emeralds. Of course it is up to Sonic and his friends again to stop Eggman and save the world.  The story is seperated into the 'Hero' and 'Dark' side.  In this game Shadow the Hedgehog and Rouge the Bat were first introduced. In each one of these you will play three diffrent characters who each have their own little story that ties into the overal plot of the game.    Playstyles:  Unlike in Sonic Adventure, SA2 does not have a world hub but a world map where you can choose which stage you want to play next or revisit.  All 6 characters are split into three diffrent play styles. Speed stages are avaiable for Sonic and Shadow, Shoot 'em up stages for Tails and Eggman and the Treasure Hunt stages for Knuckles and Rouge. After each stage you complete you get rewarded with an rank and the rings you collected in the level.   For me the best stages are the speed stages. Sonic and Shadow feel very natural while playing and they are nicely designed with great music and a very fast pace. Then there are the Shoot 'em up ones wich I don't like as much. They break the fast pace of the game similar to the Werehog in Unleashed.   I do like the Treasure Hunting stages. They are huge and I spend a long time exploring all of them. Also these stages have some of my favorite songs.  Only problem with the Treasure Hunting is that they changed the radar system from SA and you can only search one shard of the Chaos Emerald. It's pretty frustrating to back track through whole levels to get all three of them and sometimes levels can take ages since some of them are huge and they tale ages to get an A-Rank. (*sigh* Meteor Herd)  Also you have the Chao Garden and the racing minigames.  Controls:  I would reccomend playing with a controller.  I would say that SA2 has the best controls of every 3D Sonic game right now. The camera can be a bit clunky but overall okay and even if you play the speed sections you never feel like you are not in control of Sonic or Shadow.   The controls for the Shoot 'em up and Treasure Hunting sections are are very diffrent. Of course you have to walk around but you will have much more jumping and hovering and many enemys you have to clear out of the way.  Treasure Hunting doesn't have a linear design. You can fly around and explore and dig for treasures and the missing shards of the Chaos Emerald. You have a radar to help you locate all pieces hidden in the level and tips you can get from various flying TV's all around the level.   Sound:   The voice acting is average but the music is one of the best Sonic soundtracks. Each song fits it's level perfectly. There is a huge variety in genres too. Knuckles has many Rap songs where as Rouge has soft RnB like songs. Sonic, Tales and Eggman got rock songs while Shadow has some a bit darker rock songs with electronic influences.   Chao Garden:   One of my favorite parts of the game is the Chao Garden. Here you can raise little creatures called the Chaos. Each level you will play will have little animals running around or hidden somewhere. You can collect these and give them to your chao o alter their appearance and increase thir stats. Also enemys drop 'drives' which also increase Chaos attributes.  Chaos can also compete in mini games such as Chao Racing and Chao Karate. I spend hours into leveling and breeding them and raising them and mastering all mini games.   Multiplayer:  The multiplayer in Sonic Adventure 2 has been always one of my favorites. You can play almost all the levels of the main game together with a friend. Some are shorter than the ingame one but there are many that are full lenght. You can play the speed stages as well as the treausre hunting and shoot ' em up as well as the car racing minigames.  Also you can trade Chaos or let them compete against each other in a race or karate.  Sadly this is not online on the PC version. You have to have a friend next to you to play the multiplayer. Sadly it's a missed opportunity.",

Gameplay: Literally the only enojyable gameplay for me were Sonic and Shadow stages. The mechs are treasure finding ESPECIALLY in later stages can just screw off.  My main complain is control of Sonic and Shadow at high speeds... sometimes the turn just seems like 'welp, that's a thing' and the camera can be abit buggy (even when played on Dreamcast) ...  The Mech stages aren't fun for me overall. Nothing too bad about them its just not for me.  Treasure finding in this game was just crazy especially when having to look for pieces in a completely different part of the stage (like in Rouge's story) and later on the meteor stages shouldn't even have to be a thing, especially when all that gravity is in play and I'm spending 20 minutes looking for pieces that are in front of me and aren't notifying me. Fix your game Blizzard Ent. (hue hue hue hue hue)  I don't play a game much for the story so I have no input on the story's matter but in this case its more-so based on the past rather than what happened in SA1.  Enemy placement can be GAWD AWFUL a lot of the times but,.. well there's no but its just gawdawful. The placements where there is literally not even 0.01 seconds to react, you're gonna get hit unless you know what to do but if its your first time, trust me you're going to get hit.  Overall I'd say 7/10 and yea I'd still recommend this game especially if you're a fan of the series (but not Sonic '06 &gt;_&gt; offtopic)  If the character control was better, literally just the control (this would include the gravity in the Meteor stages) was better I'd say 9/10",

            "review_text": "Rating: 6.5 Most I'd Pay: $5  I can not truthfully say that 'Sonic Adventure 2' is a good game. But I still play it a lot.  There are three primary gameplay scenarios. Sonic and Shadow run through traditional platforming levels, Knuckles and Rouge fly through scavenger hunts, and Tails and Eggman shoot through gauntlets. The running levels are the best aspect of the game; while they can have significant control issues, Sonic feels good to play. and levels like City Escape are entertaining. I don't mind the scavenger hunts, even with their camera issues and a radar that only shows one target at a time. They're not good enough to stand on their own, but are a change of pace at least. The shooting sections are the only ones I completely dislike. Just tapping the fire button will get you through most levels, and enemy fights almost entirely hinge on who started firing first.  Much like the original 'Sonic Adventure' the narrative is oddly ambitious and serious. A single plot is told from dueling perspectives: the heroic Sonic, and the villainous Shadow. They see many of the same events, but we discover different parts of the story depending on who we play as. Now, I'm not someone who inherently dislikes this tone shift from the 2D games, which just had the light-hearted premise of Sonic rescuing animals from Eggman. But the execution of 'Sonic Adventure 2's' story is quite awful. The English voice acting is bad, the animations are sloppy, and the narrative is disjointed. While some of the story problems can be explained away by the different perspectives filling in gaps, the results are two conflicting storys where neither feels complete. And even if you edited them togather, there are still unexplained jumps in the story and inconsistent charaterization. The scenes where Shadow, Rouge, and Eggman discuss their plans on the space colony ARK are the epitome of everything wrong with this games narrative.  Yet, even with all these problems, I still put a lot of time into the game, both on Steam and on Gamecube. The reason is the Chao Garden. In between the action stages, you are able to visit small creatures called Chao, and raise them however you wish. You can power them up with animals you find in the main levels, and have them compete in competitions. This part of the game could have used more activities for your Chao do, but it is a surprisingly deep feature. Half my playtime of Sonic Advnture has been in service raising these mysterious little creatures.  So, my feelings on 'Sonic Adveture 2' are contradictory. It is not a good game based solely on its core features: the running, scavenging, and shooting. But the Chao Garden was enough to to keep me playing. There are probably other games with better dedicated pet sims, but 'Sonic Adventure 2' did a respectable job.",

However, Sonic Adventure 2 feels very much akin to that of a good 'direct to video sequel' rather than a full fledged follow up to the original Sonic Adventure game. Levels have been stripped down, and it is very rare, especially in Sonic's sections for levels to branch out into multiple pathways and as a result levels are extremely linear. Despite the lack of pathways, levels still manage to be fun, however on repeated playthroughs they become repetitive and boring due to the lack of variation. Sonic also seems to control much stiffer this time around, and the slower spindash removes a lot of opportunities for playing around as well as sequence breaking. Knuckle's treasure hunting stages have also been stripped down; being able to only find one emerald piece at a time is a cheap way of having the levels play out longer, and the mech stages are slow, stiff and do not feels like Sonic at all; and are a huge step back from Gamma's stage from the first Adventure.  The story is much more involved however, whilst not amazing; it is fun and perilous. Characters are colourful and there are a ton of memorable moments throughout and the darker tone is balanced nicely.  The chao garden is of course a highly regarded element, and I have to agree. It is so easy to lose yourself in this vast virtual pet mini game. There are many types of chao, each with their own personalities and talents. Mini games for them to partake in. Levelling them up and strengthening them to your own liking. It is well structured and well thought out, and the multiple gardens are relaxing and it is a fun way to wind down after playing the main story.  Whilst not the best game in the world, Sonic Adventure 2 is definitely a fun platform game; even if somewhat basic and stripped down from the game that came before it.",

Take, for instance, the lyrics of the butt-rock tune players first hear at the start of the game - within just four lines of prose, the hyper goal-driven, ADHD nature of modern life is deconstructed and damned, the fear of the great unknown is recognised and embraced, and reference is even made to the importance of furthering and developing LGBTQ rights.

The story is fun to play through, and the gameplay is nice and varied to keep you from getting too much of one thing, although you'll probably be going back to replay Sonic and Shadow's stages as they are the most fun.

The Sonic and Shadow levels are the best thing about it, although some of the later ones get ridiculously difficult due to bugs (e.g. completely missing the rails in Sonic's space-station rail-grinding level when trying to get onto one, or randomly jumping off of them into space when trying to switch between two parallel rails). Some of the Tails/Eggman shooting levels are fun, but for the most part they're rather slow and mindless. I don't know if the hot/cold treasure-hunting levels might be fun for someone who's into that sort of thing, but I found them tedious.

This game really should have come with controller support, and it was obviously just laziness on the part of whoever ported the game to PC that it doesn't.   For instance, even in the in-game manual, the explanation of the controls has a picture of an Xbox 360 controller, telling you what buttons do what. There is absolutely no explanation of what the keyboard controls are, and I finally had to press random buttons until I discovered which buttons they'd made the equivalents of each Xbox 360 gamepad button.  Even after discovering what the keyboard buttons were, this game played horribly on a keyboard. I put this game away until recently, when I got a gamepad and was able to map the buttons correctly using Xpadder. Now the game feels comfortable and correct.   TL:DR - The keyboard controls are terrible. Only buy if you have a gamepad and are okay with using Xpadder or similar.",

Unlike the original, Adventure 2 gives Sonic quite some time before reaching running speed to show off his new running animation. If you like running fast, I'd recommend getting the SA2 Mod Loader and activating the Turbo cheat. Back on topic. Shadow feels too much like a clone of Sonic, as Eggman feels too much like a clone of Tails -- Both gameplay-wise. The gem-hunting stages as Knuckles and Rouge are not as fun as I've heard them be in Adventure; now, you have to search for one specific Master Emerlad shard, directed to you by the game. If you wish to speedrun the game, it would be wise, SEGA, to have each shard to be in the same place as the first time you played the stage. Hope you catch my drift.

            "review_text": "I absolutely loved this game on my Gamecube years back, and when I found a PC vesion, I was excited to revisit what many Sonic fans consider a masterpeice, this game is not a masterpeice. So the game is split up between 3 sections, Speed (Starring Sonic and Shadow), Mech shooting (with Tails and Robotnik) and the Treasure Hunting (Knuckles and Rouge) When most people talk about how fun the game is, they are usually talking about the speed sections, and they are some of the most boring Sonic levels I have ever played. They are all extremely linear and feel mostly the same (set aside a few level gimmicks like a truck). These were the most fun this game offers though. The Mech shooting is trying to cappitalize off the Gamma's playstyle in Sonic Adventure 1 and it is not nearly as fun now. Imagine the Sonic levels, only slower, god awful controls, and has guns. (So basically it's Shadow the Hedgehog) The treasure hunting stages are the worst. There is this 'radar' that doesn't show you were the treasure is half the time because it wants you to find them in a set order... really? The controls were actually decent during these, only this game does not work very well on a keyboard. The graphics are ok enough considering how old the game is at this point, but the sound, oh god the sound! There are some nice music tracks but it lacks variety, 95% of the music in this game is metal, with the only exception being the occasional smooth-jazz or cheesy raps. During cutscenes the mnusic drowns out the characters so I can barely hear them, which isn't to bad because I'm not missing much here. The plot is chock full of loopholes, missed oppritunities, unexplained crap, and is generally an uninteresting mess. Sonic and Robotniks voice actors aren't terrible, but everyone else does an either mediocre job, or one that makes me want to shave off my ears *cough Tails cough* Oh yeah, I almost forgot about the chao garden, I applaud the devolpers for how deep of a mode this is, and I see the appeal, but it wasn't for me. This game has aged horribly, even people who played it growing up will notice how lack-lester of a game it really is.",

There is a modding scene for this game if you are into modding, personally I'd reccomend Chao World Extended by DarkyBenji, which can be found with a Google search. Overall it functions identically to how it worked on the Gamecube.The Chao gardens do face slight graphical glitches in the Hero/power and especially hero/run evolutions, as well as the weird bright chao glitch that replaces the shiny two tones.",

Unique power-ups hidden for certain characters in some levels give the player incentive to replay old stages and reach new secret areas that they couldn't before.

Pros: Good Storyline CHAO!!! Nostalgia Cons: The DLC for this game is what was part of the full game on Gamecube. There is a bus on your head during the first level so you can't see anything when the camera is pointed upward. The camera is godawful, if you change the camera angle it will switch back when you move, the camera sometimes gets 'stuck' so you're in a room but all you can see is a wall and the angle sometimes changes mid jump which kills you in some levels.   All in all it feels like the game developers just imported this over from the PS3/XB360, added a start menu before the game lauches then left it.It's a good game but the bugs really kill the game sometimes. I'm not the best coder, but the fact a player has a freaking bus on their head is a) very annoying and can kill you b) should't be impossible to fix but this is a very old game so doubt anything will change.",
