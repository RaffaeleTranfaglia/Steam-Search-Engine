            "review_text": "If you enjoy the board game and want to know whether this is worth playing, this review is for you.  First of all, let it be known that this is basically a straight port of the IOS/Android version. If you've played it on those platforms, you already know what to expect. It's the same game with a few graphics options.  Battlelore Command is a great way of learning the rules of the game without having to worry about getting a friend together and going through the physical, sometimes time consuming setup.   It has a a campaign mode which takes you through various challenges, gradually giving you access to all the different units from the game. This way, you get to slowly learn how to play with each of the units by completing different challenges.  The game can be unforgiving though. Expect to roll 5 dice with nothing but lore or misses from time to time. While it can be crushing and frustrating when this happens, it really simulates the game well and forces you to use every advantage you get well. Good tactics and smart use of lore abilities will always make the superior player come out on top.  I have not tried this yet but I have read that it supports cross-platform multiplayer (meaning you could possibly play this game online vs a friend on the iPad or Android tablet/phone). It also supports touch screens, so if you're running this on a Windows tablet or hybrid computer (like my Asus Transformerbook T100), it will work well with it.  Overall, a solid implementation of Battlelore that will give you new appreciation for the table top game.   ",
