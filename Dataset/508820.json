First to gather all the sticks and heading to the exit while mapping the path, second is to repeat the process of heading to the exit till you Ace the stage, or vice versa.   Test of endurance with zero error of mistake, every keypress is crucial, every milliseconds counts. Prepare to get your fingers numb.   The price is moderately low, Recommend to try if you have the patience. Good Game.",
