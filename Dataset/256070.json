            "review_text": "This MONDAY, MONDAY, MONDAY, throw in some Truck Racer to race TRUCKS or any day really. Get in a Big rig of steel, just like Euro Truck Sim, except now with 100% more racing! Menus are easy to navigate, probably one of the best UI's made in a long time. All the menus are awesome, they flow really easily, not much of a learning curve for people familiar with race games. Best part is I havent noticed that rubber band AI stuff, where one accident spells doom as evry car races past you but no matter how good you do they are always catching up. In fact they crash and all kinds of amusing stuff catching up. The races arent too long, so its easy to play a round then go do something and then pick it up again later. Loads of customization, other trucks, and upgrades keep the game interesting.   Rating: 10/10 Value: $24.99",

And when you progress to the harder levels of the game, 'hard' = bumper cars. If getting punted all over the race-track by AI-controlled trucks sounds like fun, by all means buy this game. Decent graphics, fair customization and destructible trucks can't make up for the small amount of tracks and locations.   Think of it as an arcade game and get it on sale for 75% off, and you probably won't be too disappointed. But there are better racing games out there.",

The only problem for me is that the game is very short. it took me less than 10h to complete the single player mode. maybe 20 bucks it's too much for the game... I don't know. But when it's on sale it's a very nice game that I recommend.",

The AI is INSANELY easy, there isn't a single race event I didn't get 1st place in my first time around, usually by 30-60 seconds. You will lap the AI multiple times, but the drifty physics make it still fun to drive around the short tracks. I played through the campaign in 5 hours, although the game had worn off after 2-3.",
