            "review_text": "I'll be honest, I only bought this because the Humblr Store had it on sale and it was a pretty looking game with furries that took itself seriously instead of being a mascot title. That's a rarity, especially in the kind of mainstream stuff you buy on Steam or XBLA.  That was the reason I bought it at first, but I finally got around to playing and it wound up being the best $2.99 I ever spent and a game that might actually break the top 10 on my list of all time favorite games.  The first thing you'll notice going in is that the graphics are BEAUTAFUL and there's some real nice fine detail in the animations like the fabric of Dust's clothes rippling as he moves. The effects like explosions, projectale attacks, and lighting are also really pretty and can result in some great atmosphere and awesome moments during combat. It feels almost like an interactive cartoon at times.  It also ran maxed out flawlessly on my 750ti/FX-8320 at a solid 60FPS that only dropped to 51 during loading and cutscenes, but I think that's more an issue with how the game load assets than something that more horse-power or optimization is going to fix  The second thing is the story is great and will more than likely bring you close to tears on far more than one occasion, I can only describe the emotional rollercoaster than ensues from the ending of the second chapter onwards as something that wants to break you one way or the other. The story has some fantasy cliches, but it uses them well to paint a world that world that likable because it would be unashamably idealistic if it wasn't at war. I'd almost say it remained that way in spite of itself because all the drama and heartache makes it feel very much like you're earning a happy ending for all the people you help along the way.  The game also has a welcome sense of humor in it's lighter movemets that comes from hanging a lampshade on common RPG tropes like stuffing huge items in your pockets or random fetch-quests.   The gameplay is a simple side-scrolling RPG with Castlevania exploration and some pretty hefty rewards for putting the effort to cheack everywhere and uncover every secrect in the gameworld. The combat is very much a button-mashing that relies on timing and keeping up with on-screen action to rack-up combos and avoid getting hit instead of complicated combos or a huge arsenal of moves.   So yeah, I'd say this is worth a buy and a place in anyone's libraiy.",

            "review_text": "Dust: An Elysian Tail...  To be honest, I only bought the game due to the viusals on the previews. Those alone seemed to be amazing and played a decisive factor. At first, given all the reviews, I was a bit sceptycal. I was afraid that it would be an over hyped game by the community and in the end it would something bland. Fortunately, it wasnt the case.  So the big plus on Dust: + amazing visuals (except cut scenes - those appear to be from early free flash games) + cool combat system. Amazingly fluid! + cool soundtrack + interesting level construction + Easy to play and to master  + gameplay length just right  The bad: - Story is rather generic (it has a couple of twists, but nothing unseen before or trully unpredictable) - may become repetitive at times - can´t seem to skip some cut-scenes. - perhaps a 'nightmare' mode should be considered  I think those minus can even be neglected / forgotten given the quality of the game. I can imagine myself playing it over again in a couple of years time.  I had fun playing this game. I took my time to make my character quite strong (I think I was level 50 - 52 when I finished the game. I had a lot of fun in some levels, and loved the final boss battle. I have finished the game, recovered my last save, gained a couple of levels only to play the final boss battle again.  I thought that the game could be a bit more difficult. Appart from a couple of situations that were actually tricky, you can almost go through the whole game without actually feeling that you are in an eminent risk of dying. However, this is a dream game at every level for a younger audiance.  My recommendation - get the game and play it. You will often find it on steam sales w 75% discount (I have seen it like that 3 or 4 times until decided that I should buy it), but after playing it, I feel that the full price would be a fair deal.  Hope the analysis was useful for all the undecided.  Cheers, Latinnus",

The game was almost entirely made by Dean Dodrill (the creator) alone. He handpainted the games' visulals and vistas, wrote the story alongside Alex Kain and programmed the game himself.  I played the game on the normal difficulty setting using a keyboard and a mouse and spent about 16 hours completing all the levels and collecting all the collectibles.

What I loved most is the simplicity of the controls which you can get the hang of quickly so you can enjoy playing the game fluently. For treasure hunters and completionists there are things to look for with the appropriate rewards, that do tend to make the game easier though. If you are looking for a hard game then you should not start on normal difficulty.  ",

            "review_text": "I wish Steam had an 'Ehhhh...' option.  Let's start with the good -  Dust  looks great, controls well, has a passable soundtrack, and the writing can be quite funny at times. I laughed often at the deuteragonist Fidget's lines, and while she was entirely grating at first introduction by the middle of the game I only found her likeable.  Unfortunately, main man Dust himself never improved much. He goes back and forth between being some edgy amnesiac dude to bland to a bleeding heart. He doesn't improve in motivation or reasoning, even after his exposition scenes. The villain meanwhile twirls his mustache at every turn while literally slaughtering men, women, and children alike. Fun.  This game never really marketed itself more than a simple beat-em-up, but the mechanics here are beyond simple. You have essentially four attacks - a ground clear, a ground slam, an air knock-up, and some attack where you spin through the air. Fidget also has the ability to shoot projectiles which are amplified by your spin attack, but there's very little difference between the 3 options and they don't interact with your other attacks in any way besides juggling enemies.   This wouldn't be a problem if the game was varied in other ways... but it's not. Enemies are basically all reskins of each other and the best way to play is button mashing due to the number of mobs that can clutter your screen. The game has a parry mechanic, but outside of it happening randomly the only times you bother to make use of it are for enemies designed to require its use. In fact, none of the attacks in your repertoire feel particularly natural to use - they all seem as effective as one another and there's no combo system to speak of. There is  some  degree of animation canceling utilized via crouching, but again it's pointless to use given how  Dust  requires absolutely zero strategy or mechanics to speak of.  Level design is passable at best and at worst makes you want to tear your hair out. Levels are simply too long for what they offer. Like the gameplay, they're repetitive and on the rare occasion things are mixed up, it's in an annoying fashion. I have absolutely zero idea why anyone would think that hazards that essentially explode randomly would be a good idea, much less to cover entire sections of levels with them. And surround them with spike traps. I certainly love having three hazards explode at once, leaving no opportunity to dodge, only to send me into conveniently placed spikes so that I may die without option. Fun.  Anyway, regardless of all these multiple faults I did, I suppose, have some fun with  Dust . Despite the terrible story, the repetitive gameplay, and the occasionally annoying level design, the game did offer some honestly cool moments. The animations and sprite effects when dealing with a group of enemies can look amazing, and stuff like grabbing a guy with your sword then slamming him into a group of enemies takes a long time to get old.  With that, I'd recommend  Dust  to the younger gamer. It's something I would have loved at a young age, where flashy effects and simple gameplay were the bee's knees, but for anyone else I'd probably pass.",

Speaking of graphics, the game looks fantastic. The drawn graphics are even more beautiful than Rayman Legends.   The music is wonderful. HyperDuck Studios did a very good job at creating those long, varied tracks. The voice acting is good, not the best out there but good.  The game is a mix of action, platforming and RPG and it works really well. The combat is quite simple, but fun. The exploration is fun too. There are quite a few sidequests as well. The gameplay works really well, and the fact it was programmed by a single person is simply impressive.  The story is enjoyable and quite well-written. The character are likeable. Despite the quite serious tone, there's a lot of humour and even some references to other games (like that stupid tornado thing from Castlevania 2). The game is a little short, but if you're a completionist and want to clear everything, it might take about 15-20 hours, otherwise... about 10.

            "review_text": "This is a game that knows exactly what it wants to be and delivers it in style. A straightforward, side-scrolling platformer with simple button-mashing combo-style hack n' slash combat, pretty graphics, and a relatively interesting storyline. It's got a very stereotypical anime-esque appearance, but there's beauty in the simplicity of the game. It's extremely well developed, easy to pick up and play, and nicely eyecatching. The animation is wonderfully smooth, with very subtle background effects, and a wide variety of environments to move through as you open up more of the wider map.   I tend to think of this game as being a bit simple, but it's a work of art and it's hard to believe that it was entirely the product of one person. It must have been a labour of love, and that effort shows through. Dust is an interesting character and, almost despite myself, I became engrossed in his story and the way in which it unfolded. I was expecting something very basic and repetitive as this is a 2D platformer I bought during the sale, mainly because I'm a sucker for pretty artwork in games. I didn't expect much beyond a couple of hours of simple gameplay and levelling up a few times before polishing off a boss and ending the game all in time for tea.   A week later, after running through the game twice (I upped the difficulty level the second time around) and earning all of the achievements, proved me totally wrong. At first I was skeptical; I found the characters to be a little bit twee and stereotypical, but as they and the story line developed I got hooked. It's suitable for all ages so don't expect any gore or adult themes, but there's a certain appeal in the innocence of the game; it's certainly not boring, and there are enough challenges and changes to keep you interested despite the fairly repetitive nature of platform gaming. It may appear cartoonish but there are some serious moral themes discussed and life lessons to be learnt. Picking up new abilities throughout the game gets you returning to previous maps to complete things you couldn't do earlier in the game, which nicely prevents it from being a linear run-through from one level to the next.   It's hard to criticise this game because it doesn't promise any more than it delivers. You don't feel short-changed by the simplicity of the game play or the slightly 'cutesy' characters. It's easy to play through, which might be disappointing if you're looking for more of a challenge. It is fairly repetitive but the enemies do get tougher as the game develops, matching your character's development. The challenge arenas are the only places where you can really push your skills to try to get that elusive four-star rating.   The other downside is the boss fights - it's a button-masher so just keep hitting the combos for long enough and the boss goes down, it's as simple as that. But again, it's hard to criticise because the game delivers exactly what it promises. It's enjoyable but not astonishing. I recommend it as a pleasant and pretty game to play, a nice bit of simple escapism that isn't going to challenge or frustrate you.",

I honestly expected this game to be much more cliche as I was expecting Dust's sidekick, Fidget, to be annoying and Ginger to be the FRI ( f orced  r omantic  i nterest). Fortunately I was wrong as Fidget was actually a pretty charming character and Ginger, despite sharing some obvious chemistry with Dust, doesn't pull the whole  'falling in love, saying 'I love you,' and share a long kiss'  sort of thing with Dust. The other characters in the story are also pretty memorable, the voice acting is well done, the soundtrack is great, the visual style is superbly beautiful, and the story keeps you drawn in and intrigued.  As for the gameplay, it has a fair amount of RPG elements (despite only using one weapon throughout the game), fluid combat, and vivid and vast environments. The game is also pretty nostalgic in a sense as it's a 2-D side-scroller. The game honestly isn't too long in terms of the main quest, but there are plenty of side quests and things to unlock and find to keep the game going especially if you're the kind of person who's a  'completion freak.'   Now there are some people who negatively judge the game because it supposedly has sort of a  'furry'  vibe to it, but don't let that deter you. Honestly, I'm by all means not a furry and I personally can't stand a majority of the fandom. But trust me, this game is a lot more than meets the eye. The game has zero traces of the perversion most people typically think of when it comes to the furry fandom. For me, the fact that the world in this game, known as Falana, is populated by anthropomorphic animals just makes it seem a lot more unique and stylized.  For my final verdict, I give  Dust: An Elysian Tail  a  9/10 . Whether you consider yourself a furry or not, this game is an intriguing experience that keeps you drawn in and it has its own unique lore. This is a game that I can consider myself to be a fan of and if there is to be a sequel.... I'm definitely excited to see what will happen next!",

It has amazing artwork, great sence of humour and intersting characters. The story keeps you interested and you will want to know what will happen next, who is everybody and why things are happening. There are some references from other games (some are very well hidden) but not too hard to find if you use your head.   Some negative points worth noting:  I used xbox 360 controller to play and sometimes found that using analog stick to perform certain actions might cause you to do the wrong move. This is really annoying when you try to do trials where time and precision is crucial. I failed so many times when my character jumped instead of ducking and sliding or vice versa. I do however recommend playing with a controller even though keyboard and mouse works great, controller is still better.  You will probably want to play it once because once you know the story there will be no point in playing again so if you played on casual you are simply wasted your time because it was too easy and you can finish it in few hours. There are, however, 25 sidequestes which you can complete and you won't get all achievements unless you do them all.  Difficulty curve is not ideal. On harcode mode is really hard to start that will cause you to die over and over until you reach some levels or keep killing same enemies over and over. Later on it when you level up and get some items it becomes too easy. Simply be patient and you will enjoy the game without any annoying issues.  Overall it is great game that is worth your time.

I love this game for many reasons: the music is absolutely amazing, the background and characters are beautifully rendered and react to wind, rain and fighting, the combat has about 6-7 combos in total but you have so much freedom of movement that it feels like your pulling off 15-20 string combos, and the story is amazingly compelling. The sidekick you have through the game, Fidget The Nimbat, made me laugh many times and is a really good asset in combat. The combat rewards you for having long unbroken combo chains (there is an sidequest that has you get a 1000 hit combo) and reminds me of something Platinum Games would make.   There are many little nods and easter eggs in the game from all of gaming history. They can be usuable items to the merchant to treasures you find in the world. The game really rewards exploration with items and money and health upgrades.  The one weakness Dust: An Elysian Tail suffers from is the boss battles. It is usually one enemy that you fight , and it becomes trivial because you dodge their attacks and chain combos on them when there just standing there. The boss battles can be overlooked if you get really interested in the story.  I would reccommend you play this game of the 'Tough' difficulty, because normal is too easy for most people. The 'Hardcore' difficulty is best saved for a second playthrough because you take more damage and enemies take less damage.  I cannot reccommend this game enough to anyone that calls themselves a gamer. If you can get over the fact that the characters are anthromorphic animals and it is metroidvania styled , you will see a compelling story, beautiful design, music that is on par with Super Mario Galaxy, and a combat system that allows you to chain combos indefinitely.",

At first the story didn't really spark much interest--being the typical 'all powerful mysterious warrior with amnesia traversing the land helping it's people while trying to regain his dark and mysterious memory'-- but as it went on it started to pull me in. It's best described as a cross between Okami and Rayman Origins with a little bit of Kingdom Hearts sprinkled on top. (Pros and cons below.)  Pros: -Beautifully orchestrated music -Painfully detailed environments and weather effects -Very touching and emotionally impacting. Feelings of pain, sorrow, love--concepts of life and death are handled maturely like they should be and conveyed to the player -Excellent, passionate voice acting -Exciting and tense moments  Neutral: -The humor is 50-50. There are some funny jokes. There are some dry jokes. -Storyline may or may not provide the player with much interest. -The difficulty fluxuates. Some areas are very easy, some areas suddenly ♥♥♥♥ you.  Cons: -A bit on the short side -Typical hack'n slash with redundant combat -VERY few combos to use; especially for a hack n'slash -Hordes of respawning enemies can be a bit overwhelming and annoying at times -Boss battles are complete jokes. Normal enemies are more life threatening than the bosses -Practically no replay value  Conclusion: -6.5/10. While the gameplay and hack'n slash elements are regretably limited, this game is a work of art. It's a 2D game that has infinitely more heart and soul put into it than most overrated 3D Micheal Bay games out today. It is TRULY a work of art and deserves as much support and recognition as it can get for its BEAUTY instead of gameplay which unfortunately is below par. Of course artistry isn't for everyone.

Combat, though is a little repetitive after a while (projectiles change things up for a bit, but not for long). I hate how the game is deceptively easy, yet on tough difficulty, enemies can nearly one shot you. This isn't a huge problem since you find too many health items (perhaps this is deliberate), but this leads to a carefree 'attack relentlessly and heal when you're hit gameplay' instead of a methodical approach like the best action games. I don't think this will bother most other gamers though. This requires an 360 Pad/Emulator, despite the 'Full gamepad support' selling point.",

Luckily, the main character isn't bad, but your 'companion' is almost as annoying as Navi. If you're lucky, you can read fast and skip over the voice acting/bad dialogue writing. The story is also subpar and fairly predictable.  But, then you may wonder why I've played this game for 14 hours (as of writing this review.) Well, that's because the game play is just fun. It's not quite a beat 'em up but there are small hoardes of weak characters with some stronger ones thrown in (not counting the bosses.) There is a hit-combo tracker in the top corner of your screen and a minor quest, plus the steam achievements drive you to really try to continuously hit as many times as possible. It's not simple. It also contains moves that are done using certain button pressing and joystick controls in a row or in combination. Beyond that, it contains 'metroid-vania' skills that give you access to new areas, further parts of the story, and treasure you missed when first going through areas. There are side quests and the ability to buy or make armor/rings/weapon-improving items.   There are definitely some things that I just would rather not deal with with this game, but it's all in the cut scenes/story which is not a huge part of the actual gameplay which is good, because the game play is fun and continuously makes me want to move forward in the game.

I'd recommend getting it if it is on sale for cheap because it's fun, but it's not really all that original, and it's not all that polished.  Additional note: I cannot speak to how the game plays with a keyboard&amp;mouse or just a keyboard (both options). I played this game using an Xbox remote as it seemed to be easier on my fingers since there is a lot of action-button pressing and thumbs do that better than fingers.",

Add to that the RPG elements to give this game that addictive element of progression and the lust for exploration and you would be wondering what this game could possible miss out on - because from my POV everything else is just as great to say the least (characters, voice acting and the story which I really loved).  In regards to MvG, the character Fidget may very well be the only thing that could be considered a dealbreaker to some people. I for one couldn't imagine why because I think she's a charming and very lovable character but hey: not everyone is into 'cutesy' things so I suppose her voice and dialogue may rile up certain kinds of people.  Anyhoo.. Great game, I'm a sucker for it. For it's full price it's already a steal because I honestly think it's worth more. ◕◡◕",

I originally bought the game just because it was so amazingly pretty, and started playing it with the thought that the story would be terrible and the voice acting mediocre. Boy, was I wrong. The story is so compelling that it drew me in, even when I wasn't even planning to let myself be drawn in by it. And for indie voice actors/actresses, these people have done a stellar job.   As far as combat is concerned, this combat is amazingly satisfying. I'm not terribly into hack-and-slashes, but this one does a stellar job of making you feel like a powerful warrior by giving you lots of intuitive combos and such. And if you're like me and you just want to mash one or two buttons, there's a lot of different combos with just the left and right mouse buttons, which really makes you want to stop mashing buttons and think about what you're doing instead. It works beautifully.  It's hard to believe that this is a console port, but it is, and the port was done so amazingly well that it's far better than most native PC games I've played.  Of course, the question of furries always comes up with anthropomorphic animals (Like those that appear in this game). From what little I've seen, furry art tends to be... well, furry. The characters here are clean-cut and undersexualized in comparison, and really look more like Looney Tunes than anything else. I'll be honest; I'm not into anthro stuff at all, but these characters are drawn well enough that I don't mind. And what 90's kid grew up without Looney Tunes? Well, a few, obviously, but the rest of us didn't care at the time about anthro-looking characters, so why care now?  Anyway, overall this game is stellar, and I'm mighty impressed with the cool stuff this guy did with a seemingly simple engine. Did I mention this game was made by one guy? This game was made by one guy. And you can feel the love he poured into every pore. And hey, if nothing else, go into this game to wander around and admire the scenery. It's beautiful.",

            "review_text": "You will often find, among gamers and critics alike, diverse opinions that state the positives and negatives of various games, with things such as 'the game is good' or 'the game was too short' or 'the controls suck.'  This is not the case with Dust: An Elysian Tail. I have been a gamer my entire life, ostracized as a child in school by the very people now addicted to Call of Duties and Madden NFLs. I have watched the evolution of gaming from the 8-and-16-bit era of Mario and Sonic, the evolution of PC gaming from text based RPGs to DragonAge and Skyrim.  Of all the games I have played, from casual Runescape to the intensely cerebral Europa Universalis, from the flashy twitch gaming of Smash Brothers to the thought-out fights of Guild Wars. 'Dust: An Elysian Tail' is by far one of the most defining creations in the Gaming Industry. What makes it more spectacular and amazing is the story of a single man hand-drawing and developing the game from scratch over years, of an indie developer given a chance on Xbox Arcade.  Dead Dodrill has brought to us a game that, in collaboration with secondary writer Alex Kain, and composers Alexander Brandon and HypderDuck Soundworks, defines everything we love about gaming. He brings us back to the core elements of a video game.  I can say, without a doubt in my mind, that Dust: An Elysian Tail is, by far, the greatest representation of Video Games as an Artform. If there ever any confusion or concern if games could be consider Art, Dead Dodrill has proved us otherwise.  No amount of praise I could give would satisfy my love for this game. For 17 years, Blizzard Entertainment's Starcraft franchise has held a special place in my heart as my favorite game of all time. Upon completion of this artistic masterwork, I can say that this has changed.  Dean Dodrill, Alexander Brandon, and everyone else that not only made this game possible, but brought it to the attention of the general public. I thank you, and I heartily reccommend this game for anyone.",

            "review_text": " After beating Chapter 1 (hardcore mode) review   So far, so good. And I mean  really  good. The story, admittedly, has been done before (Ex-superevilarmy soldier suddenly can't remember things because reasons and is now good guy but slowly uncovers his dark past and has to reconcile with his sins etc etc), but it isn't presented or executed (at least so far) in an incredible cliched or dull manner. It's clear that Dust, the main protagonist and player character, actually did some pretty evil stuff and assisted in the annihilation of a race (or maybe only partially). When you figure out more about Dust, you start to become wary of learning about his past, afraid of what you might uncover and realize who you are playing as. Gameplay is solid, hack-and-slash type deal with mobs of enemies coming at you once. I immediately went to hardcore mode starting out, and personally I feel like a lot of the difficulty does come simply from damage outputs from enemies being increased. I can be dancing around everyone, sawing through flocks of those flying toad dudes with dust storm, and suddenly git rekt if I get hit like once or twice (ie the insta-kill giants, but considering they're giants that makes sense). This isn't to say the enemy AI aren't smart in their own right, definitely not a bunch of bumbling idiots with aim-bot and ridiculous stats (*cough*modernfps*cough*), but it does effect my experience enough to be noted. The combos, tho,  the combos . I swear I feel like a Touhou character whizzing around and throwing everyone and everything into the air and then showering the battlefield with bullets from Fidget and making Storm from the X-Men look like a South Dakota summer breaze on a Sunday in July. I am rewarded executing a long chain of combos and moves and what nots with extra experience rather than just spamming a basic or other attack. In fact, you can't even spam a single attack or any single set of attacks, because you'll git rekt. The mechanics of each move or dust storm or Fidget's bullets force you to change things up as you go along because even these super-amazing-I'm-a-♥♥♥♥ing-god move sets have their limits, even hurting yourself in some casese if not executed properly. Skill is needed to cut through literal armies of monster mooks. Speaking of the enemies, the design is repititive but at the same time varied. In the first chapter, you'll see the same monsters from the beginning continuously re-appear throughout to the end, while others are still added as you go along. However, very rarely did I see more than two of the same looking hairless-club-wielding-dog-thing, each enemy type has several skins to change around and add some color to what would otherwise be a boring homogeneous legion. Even futher, the basic design and look of each enemy is pleasant to look at in itself. They're colorful and full of little details that give the mooks some character of their own. I even found myself feeling a little sorry for them, wondering if they had hopes and dreams of their own, but I guess that's just my traumatization from Undertale talking. The final boss of chapter one definitely threw the plot for a loop. At first I thought 'oh no super cliche warlord guy rallying usually non-threatening army of mountain monsters into a full-fledged and organized assault where HAVEN'T I seen this before', which is still technically true even after defeating him and listening to his dialogue. But  holy ♥♥♥♥  did I feel like a god damn prick when his backstory was revealed and suddenly things are going from happy-go-lucky fantasty monster slaying to 'oh my god what am I doing I'm a monster'. Something that did definitely irk me after the boss fight however was the fact that you still go about slaying the monsters, which Fidget even speaks up about wondering if they should continue slaughtering them. Voice acting is a  little  cringy at times, and that's nothing from the actual voices but from the lines themselves, tho I am an anti-social prick that rarely has a decent face-to-face conversation in real life so I probably wouldn't know. However I will not lie in saying anyone can tell the budget wasn't exactly sky-high when listening. The friendly characters are nice to chat with, that's for certain. No one's overly annoying or obviously a rip-off of some other character from another game to serve the same purpose. I really like the travelling merchant guy and his mysterious appearance, can't tell what sort of anthropomorphic animal he is. However I distinctly remember wanting to close off every conversation with the merchent in Aurora village as quickly as possible. Finally, a comment on the anthropomorphism. At first glance of this game I thought the only reason it had an overwhelmingly positive response was because only furries were looking at it and only praising it because anthro (which I would like to say really quickly that I don't give a rat's ♥♥♥ if you're a furry, I just call out circle-jerking when I see it). However I was slapped across the face with wrong when I realize it's more of a Disney-esque anthro thing going on, rather than just 'because anthro'. The designs of the characters are cartoony and simple, I can tell only just enough time was spent on them to be aesthetically pleasing and not overly elaborate with human-animal mixture stuff. That being said, I'm still carving my way through chapter 2, and will post my review for that probably maybe idk. Thanks for reading.",

            "review_text": "At first glance I had a lot of assumptions about what this game would be, not anything to do with story or characters, but the type of genre the game inhabits and how it goes about that. In many ways it met those assumptions and while I was right it still managed to exceed my thoughts.  A few screens and videos and to me this came off as a simplified metroid-like with a more straight forward beat-em up presentation. And my deep abiding love for any exploration based game was left mildly wanting to know that it really has more in line with Odin Sphere/Muramasa than Metroid it still has enough exploratory quirks to ever so slightly scratch that itch.  What brings this simplicity bright, to me, is the trappings that are around the basic structure. The combat is fine to me, I don't find it completely compelling but it is satisfying in the way your character feels powerful and the agency through which you give him that power is what compels me through the game. Items, leveling up, quests. The depth is not great but it's all deep enough to just make the rest of it so easy to breeze through and feel constantly in a state of needing to get more from the game because it has the ability to give you more. I feel this lust for progress on the mechanical/statistical spectrum that drives me through the game itself elegantly.  And that's not to say the story is creating any sort of roadblock to that. It's actually very well put together and while nearly cloying and childish at times it has an aspect that reflects back this younger version of yourself. Old Saturday morning cartoons, Disney movies, or even just any broadly aimed animated feature. It plays into that in a way that almost makes it okay to be so silly or ardent in child-like way. It's also interesting in how juxtaposed that is to the darker aspects of the story and how easily it accomplishes that without feeling overbearing or too self-serious. And it's startling how good the voice acting is in this game, disregarding some odd lines that sound re-recorded and not quite on point as the same voice from the same session.  The gameplay itself may not be memorable to me but it really is fun to play and progress through. It may feel a little simplistic to start or jarringly sharp or oppressive in its presentation but I think its just so out of our usual context for that type of over the top character expression that it feels wrong at first, though over time it felt right at home.",

If you liked Castlevania or Metroids gameplay (the classics, not the primes or...whatever the hell the last castlevania was) you'll probably love this game's feel. It's got a neat hack n' slash combo type fighting system that progresses fairly well with new abilities coming in at just the right time. The only downside is the game is a tad easy. Still, this game is nearly perfect in every category with a whomping roughly 14 hours of gameplay + time to get the rest of the achievements. For a 15 dollar game, it was more than satisfying. I liked the story, some people didn't feel the same way, some of the characters are annoying but they'll grow on you. And of course, people who hate furries will probably want to stay away from this game despite it being fantastic, since wutwill/b/think. Anyhow, for the price, gotta give this a 9.8/10. Must buy for old school MetroidVania fans.",

Timing is essentia for a counter-attack. Long story short, it has satisfying combat and rewarding quests.  b.Story There was a war between a powerful race, who run a campaign to dominate the world, by crushing other weaker races to their ground. But then, there was someone, who mysteriously reborn to this world with an amnesia. War and a reincarnate? Is it a sign for something great is gonna happen?  c.Graphics Dust has a cartoonish graphic, but that doesn't it's a bad thing. In fact, the graphic is beautiful and it's HD. For those who don't like cartoon graphic, you might wanna reconsider before buying.  d.Replayability Most of the time I enjoy the fighting, crafting better equipment, and do the side quests. There is no new game plus feature, but we can always start over with different stats build.

His character is baseless. For literally the entire game, I was waiting for Gaius's character to be explored in some way.

Dust may be a hard game but it's also fair, if you get hit you have nobody to blame but yourself. Controles are responcave, but I have to wounder why the are optimized for left handed people. Nothing against left handed people, it's just right-handedness is far more common. Not that this subtracts from anything. 10/10 for gameplay.   Level design is good. You are never really bafeled on what to do next. The first half half the the game has really fun level design, but it starts going downhill on chapter 3, the last part of the game is pretty good though. Enemies, while fun to fight, should have had a little more veriety, especially during the last 2 chapters. Most of the bosses merly meet the stadards they have, but the final boss is increadably good. Overall I give the level disign a 8/10   Music is... Meh. While the all music is very pretty, there are only two memorable songs; the song for the last stretch before the final boss, and the final boss's song. 7/10   The art is... Wow. Just wow. The art style is wounderful, and each sprite looks like it was hand-painted. Easilly the having the best grafics I have ever seen in a videogame, Dust is the only game where I can honastly say the grafics increased my enjoyment. Plus, there is a mode for colorblind people to deal with the few spots in the game where you need to see color. 10/10 for art.   And now for the story. Which is great. Dust is one of the few games that got me to care about the story. The ending subratcs a little though. (SPOILER ALART!)    You die at the end. OK, I can see that sacrifice as being nessisary. But then you might not be dead? After burning in lava? Really?   (END SPOILER ALART!) 9 out of 10 for story.  Well that wraps that up. I would EASILY recomend this game. It's a little short, so if you get it try to do all the sidequests. Luckily multiple diffaculty settings triple the replayability. (Just don't do casual. Casual mode is for wimps. You can't die in that mode.) 8/10 overall.",

Or the fact that it doesn't cost $120?  Its a fairly smooth and enjoyable beat-em up with some platforming, RPG and questing elements which all mix in very well with one another. You typically won't get bored with the opponents and encounters due to their diversity and the art style is really well done - I'd love it if a certain universe of mine had even half the graphical quality this game has.  It is a bit short, clocking in at around 7 to 8 hours but it really depends on the difficulty. If you play this, play on normal or higher - normal itself could be considered 'easy' where easy could be considered 'toddler' difficulty.  It really doesn't have any flaws, it even controls well with the mouse and keyboard - argurably one of the smoothest controls I've ever used in a game like this. And, you will like the writing for the game, whoever wrote for Fidget needs to write for more games.  9\\10. No Multiplayer and lack of replay appeal if you beat the game on the hardest difficulty, and if you know me, I don't give high scores lightly - especially on these sorts of games.",

            "review_text": "Dust is a serious adventure RPG that can be turned way simple for easy fun / exploration, or way hard into true hardcore 2D bash-em combat with an impressive combo system that can do various types of attacks, from ground to slide to jump and much fancier aerial moves.   The plot is relatively simple. You are Dust. You woke up in a field, not knowing yourself, when a sword... yes, a flying and TALKING sword floated up to you and addressed you as Master. Then Fidget, a Nimbat, showed up and wil accompany you on whatever quest you are supposed to go on since she comes with the sword. As you head toward the village in the distance hoping for answers, you hear fighting... Some sort of monsters are attacking the town, and you leapt into action...   The graphics are quite good, sort of Disney-esque type animal humanoid that looks far cuter than it should for all its seriousness, about finding one's true self and all the war and attack and civilian casualties, and good vs. evil and all that.   Sound is also quite good. There's some debate whether the protagonist voice sounds a bit too young, but sounds okay to me. (And you have to play the game to see why.)  There are basically three attacks (later there's a fourth, the ground slide/kick) blade, dust storm, and Fidget burst. It is the combination that makes things deadly. Blade plus jump is an aerial attack. Blade plus jump plus dust storm yields an aerial super attack. Dust storm and Fidget burst creates attack swarm. As you level up each ability through EXP (via quests and kills) you'll gain additional attacks and combos. (On casual difficulty this is done automatically)  You will also encounter various types of equipment: armor, amulet, left ring, right ring, and 'augment' (weapon enhancement). You will often encounter blueprints to build more advanced equipment... provided you find the blacksmith and have enough materials. Some stuff are available at merchant.   There are many sidequests in the story as you encounter more NPCs. Some will ask you to find X ingredients, while others want you to retrieve something or someone, or reach a particualr area and search for something. Doing them yields extra EXP to level you up.   Other activities that yields EXP are just talking to every NPC you come across (but you only get that once).   There are special 'treasure chests' in the world for you to find, and most involve some sort of a puzzle. Usually it is to pull a 'bombfruit' toward an alloy gate to blast it open, but the bombfruit can be at a challenging place so it can be difficult to pull it properly esp. when the bomb fruit may come with a timer (after X seconds, kaboom!) There are also special 'friend chests' (12 of them in the world) for you to find as you unlock your 'friends' captured in the cages. It's another type of collectible, but a fun one.   As you learn new skills, such as floor slide (to get through narrow low tunnels), double jump ( to reach extra high places), iron grip (to climb the vines) , you will discover new areas you haven't been able to reach before, and often that is how you find these extra treasure chests and cages. So exploration is a must. You will be told percentage of areas you missed and/or treasure you missed, so don't fret.   The game autosaves when you pass through a 'save point' (temple) which also heals you. You can also trigger a manual save on a savepoint. The savepoint also serves as a teleport point that allows you to leave the map region, if you bought some teleport gems (not that expensive, and you did get a few for free).   The game never felt too frustrating, except the problem of opening up a certain area before you are ready. For example, there's a mission where you need to find a girl in the 'Hidden Cove', except you can't explore that area unless you have Iron Grip skill, which is only available at the end of Sorrow Meadows. The game doesn't always make this clear. There are also some quests that are a bit too whimsical, or even on casual, way too difficult without advanced skills like double jump. However, if you are the type that goes for every bit of completion, you will no doubt feel frustrated now and then, even on casual.   There are also six 'trials', sort of a 'speed-run' through a certain level where you try to take as little damage as possible, while fighting your way past monsters and environmental hazards. And they award high level equipment, depending on how well you do, with rating of up to 4 stars (depending on score).   All in all, Dust is a very good game that, IMHO, looks way too cute for its own good that people will have problems taking ti seriously. If you can get past it, you will find a rewarding action-adventure with good puzzles and challenging bash-em on higher difficulty levels.   ",

The main thing that would give people pause when getting this is the Disney (or let's be honest - furry) aesthetic. And I've got to say, that's a problem. The story is genuinely well-written with engaging characters, but it gets subverted by the fact that everyone is some sort of fox person.

I already own the XBLA version of the game and when I get a PS4, I plan on buying it for that console. It's that good.  The story revolves around the mysterious warrior Dust and his (sometimes not so faithful) companion, Fidget the Nimbat who may I say, is the greatest companion I have ever seen with her 4th-wall breaking dialogue and the fact that she is amazingly well thought out and written (I mean really, she has a fear of heights yet she can fly. Genius). Anyways back to the story, Dust wakes up with amnesia (bit of a generic start off) and a sword is summoned to his side. The sword one of the legenday Blades Of Elysium and it's name is the Blade of Ahrah, it is also the only one that knows of him and his past so far. All of a sudden, FIdget appears and is apparently the swords guardian. She then decides to travel with Dust in his epic quest to discover his past, filled with hardship, laughs, sadness and mystery.  On to the side content; there are many side quests to go through each with their own differeing difficulty level (one in particuar has you collecting materials, some are rare, most aren't. This quest because of the rarer items had took me up until I nearly beat the bloody game to compete in some occasions) There is also a side quest which is unlockable from completing this other side quest and this second one is given to you by this boy called Corbin and he wants you to get a 1000 Hit Combo (easier than it sounds, just head to the Blackmoor Mountains and use the Dust Storm and Fidget Projectile combo attack in a corner with many enemies. Make sure it is on the games difficulty is on Easy and you have no Fidget augments active for a much easier time). Enough of side quests, now onto colletibles. There are (if I remember correctly) 12 cages scattered throughout the game and they contain many beings such as Super Meat Boy, The Kid (from Bastion) and the HyperDuck Sound Studios logo made real. These cages require 4 Keys to unlock and are usually quite difficult to get to.  Now for the story as a whole. The entire story from start to finish is like a really damn good Disney or Pixar film (which ever you prefer) but there are three things that makes it stand out from either of those... it's the delivery, writing and voice-acting. The story, whilst generic is delivered so well it sent chills down my spine and I genuinely felt involved in the games events. The writing will flood you with many different emotions such as sadness, anger, happiness and pity and it just doesn't stop with the twists to keep you intruiged. The voice-acting is flawless, not even IGN could fault it, this one part half-way through the game actually had me in tears (as did the ending) and I was actually frightened of Dust at the half-way point when he blames himself for the death of an innocent.  So yeah, generally a perfect game... I do not think there will be one to beat it in years to come. 7.8, not enough water................. I am SO sorry (couldn't resist)  In all seriousness I give it 100%, 5 Stars, 10/10 max whatever rating system you can find or think of (and this rating comes from a highly cynical 18 year old male)  Stay classy folks",

The environments ooze color and creativity, and I usually found myself marveling at the art style. The story isn't revolutionary, but it's solid and well-done, paced well throughout the game.  There are also a few references to other games, the main one being Fidget. Much like Navi from Legend of Zelda, Fidget is a small flying helper throughout the game (A nimbat, actually), providing mostly comic relief. Although some people find her voice and behavior annoying, I found it cute and endearing.  My only complaint would be that the difficulty throughout the game isn't very challenging unless you turn it up to max. You can master most of the swordplay about mid-game and be fine.  Overall, this game is probably the best thing I've played in a while; it's a hell of a blast to play, and I always found myself kept going throughout. Buy it whenever you can, a steal at $15, robbery when on sale.",

            "review_text": "FIRST IMPRESSIONS (I'll edit the review once I'm actually done with the game)  Dust: An Elysian Tail is not a game you play for the story. The story, characters and screenplay are rather weak. So if you only care about those, don't buy this game. However, the game shines in the combat, gameplay and art. I really like the Metroidvania style combat. The gameplay is really fun and the art is gorgeous especially considering the whole game was done by only one guy (excluding the voice actors and the artists for the soundtrack).  The voice acting is decent. Not amazing, but not terrible either. Soundtrack is really good. I've heard the game contains at least 10 hours of content which is a lot for an indie game. It's currently 75% off so if you don't mind a bad story, I'd say get it.  And by the way, Fidget is the most annoying character in any video game ever which is why I'm opening a group called 'Everybody Hates Fidget'.  EDIT:  The game is impossible to finish on my Macbook Pro. Every time the world map shows up the game instantly crashes. I hope they release a patch.  EDIT 2:  Apparentally this problem has been around since the game came out. I know it was done by one guy but that's really lazy. It doesn't look like a patch is coming anytime soon. Have no idea if this problem is exclusive to the Mac port or if it's for all versions.  If it's for all versions I'm going to have to give it a thumbs down, which is a shame because it's a great game.",

The controls are responsive and fast, this makes for very fast paced combats with combos reaching sometimes the thousand of hits. It does, however, feel a little bit repetitive like most games of the same genre, the game would have benefited from a little bit more combos.  Sadly the game is also too easy on Normal difficulty, i died only once on the second boss, i would recommend you play on hard from the get-go if you are an affecionado of the genre.  That being said the gameplay is solid, fun and works well for the 13-14ish hours it takes to finish it(20-21 if you complete everything.)   -The presentation-  Dust AET is visually stunning, featuring some of the most beautiful 2D i've ever seen in any games, the animations are also really impressives, fluid and detailed.  The design may not be for everyone with it's anthropomorphic cast of characters but i found them quite charming and it did not bother me in the slightest.  The story is nothing groundbreaking but has the merit of being interesting and fun to follow with some strong moments here and there thanks to the duo of Fidget and Dust.  The music is really good and has a few memorable themes which is quite rare nowaday in video games.  I will also point out that the voice acting is very well done but only available in english.   -Overall- If you don't mind the repetiveness inherent to the genre then you will find here an amazing game that is well worth the 17$ full price.",

Every aspect is perfectly functional and well made but lacking depth and I didn't feel any incentive to go deeper.  While the personal drive of the single developer is admirable the limited scope does show in the finished product. Graphics alone do not make a great game so I felt the same kind of detachment from the characters and their world that I felt for similar games like Odin Sphere that likewise excelled in style but never really draw you in emotionally or even with bare function.   Dust isn't bad but personally I can't recommend this game to anyone because everything here has been done before but better and more engaging. I know that 'bored' is the least descriptive, helpful and insightful emotional state one can express but that was alas my main reaction, which I find curious because I like every part of this game individually (or rather in other games) but not the game as a whole.

Yeah I guess I could do all the little sidequests and find all the chests and whatnot, but I beat the final boss, so I'm not really working up to anything, other than a 100% complete. All in all though, with great graphics and animations, a good story and fun gameplay, it's a great game to play!",

The story was the most amazing one I've seen in a video game in a very, very long time. Flawlessly executed with amazing gameplay, Dust: An Elysian Tail makes you think in more ways than one.  It's not a very long game, but it's not an insanely short one either. Dean Dodrill really found the sweet spot when it comes to how long a game should be. Gameplay wise it was just a bit repetitive, but there isn't much you can do about that with a 2D game such as this one. But I feel like the point of this game wasn't to give the most spectacular game when it comes to mashing buttons, but I really did have fun breaking in my new controller, but I feel it was really about the story it had to tell.  Overall, Dust: An Elysian Tail is a beautiful game with a great atmosphere and a pleasing art style. It tried it's best in all aspects and exceeded my expectations to the fullest, even when they were set fairly high from the other reviews I'd read about this game.   If you are in the market for a new 2D adventure platformer, I cannot reccomend this game enough. And for only $15, it's worth every cent.",

If you don't... maybe take a quick look and buy it anyways. BUY IT! D:&lt;  No really, it's awesome, but a few fair warnings:  - No New Game + - High Pitched Voice Acting - High-Level anime Artstyle. Really hate furries? Better don't play it...  So, now...  First of all, the artstyle, I think it's great. It's not really professional, you see it's handmade, but it fits the game just perfectly and you get used to it pretty fast. Nothing more to concern yourself with here, except the warning furry thing over there, but yeah, unbeatable if you like them. :3  Gameplay is smooth and (with a controller) you can reach a pretty fast-paced combat. Without, I don't know tbh, just played too well with a controller so I didn't want to change. But yeah, your typical hack&amp;slash metroidvania gameplay, backtracking for treasures, leveling up, statting you 4 base stats. Nothing special there, really, still great in it's simplicity.  Story... yeah, no spoilers here, just wanted to say it's not your general 'I'm the great hero who saves the world' story. Got a lot more depth and it really is a good one. Even the sidequests are fun and you won't get bored of them.  The sound... yeah, the sound, everybody complains about it. But well, I live in germany... and animes synchronized to german are just really REALLY bad. I personally think the voice-acting is great, especially Fidget's. About 90% of players complain about her, but yeah, that's totally a matter of taste, ain't it?  The soundtrack however, is just... wow. Nobody complains about it, it's great in every way. You gotta hear it yourself, but once you do, you gotta love it. :3  And the greatest reason to buy it, even tho it sounds like it's your general game... it's actually made of one person. Obviously with the help of others, you know, sound acting, artwork and stuff. But coding, planing and things... all done by one person. Idk about you, but I think that's awesome and he really deserves respect for that.   (Insert cheers for the dev here.) *sits there waiting for the sequel* :fmad:  Another tl;dr: Buy it!

But I've still logged over 30 hours over two playthroughs, so something about it works...  There are three really big problems with this game in my opinion. First, the balancing is very, very poor. The first couple hours of the game are, by far and away, the most difficult. This is because your first few levelups, which take a long time to get, multiply your base stats more than tenfold, but enemies are balanced for your stats once you've leveled up a bit, so they are wildly overpowered to start with. You just cannot afford to get hit more than a few times at the beginning of the game, but you can shrug off small mistakes for the rest of the game, even during the final chapter.  Second, the fighting mechanic is shallow. The core of the game is fighting mobs of enemies, but all of the enemies have very similar attack patterns, and your moveset isn't very complex either. After a while, you get into a grove of comboing enemies using the same spacing tecniques, and all of the fights feel very similar to each other.  And third, in my opinion, the story isn't as good as it could have been. Avoiding spoilers, when Dust's identity is revealed, the story has a lot of opportunity to explore subtle themes and to paint the antagonists in a somewhat sympathetic light. Instead, in my interpretation, it doubles down on making Dust a designated hero who gets to kill the Bad Guys because he's the Good Guy.  For those flaws, though, the game is still a lot of fun to play. There's a lot of exploration in the game with plenty of very rewarding secrets hidden in each level. And the art is absolutely geogeous. Playing this game is fun, but there are other games I can play that are both fun and don't feel like they have rough edges.",

I'm greeted by pretty, vibrant colors, good animation...sure the combat's a bit on the repetetive side to warrant a level up system, and the voice acting is barely tolerable, but whatever. It's fun at least. I play through maybe...a third of the game. Then it starts wanting me to platform....and this is where I start having issues. The character's landing is slippery. So precise platforming is pretty much out of the question. But there isn't a LOT of platforming. I chalk it up as a small annoyance to an otherwise fun game. Then...I get to a graveyard area.  The background of the area is grey. Your character is light blue. The zomies you fight are bluish grey.....see the issue? Sure one or two enemies aren't a problem, but when they come in mass, your effectively blind. Even worse if you clash with an enemy attack, because that produces a giant blue/white spark on the screen.   I slog through. 'Okay', I think to myself 'Maybe that was just a terrible choice of color. Maybe it's just a one time thing.' The next level is a snow level. Mostly white and blue....and the enemies are primarily white wolves, and some kind of goblins in blue parkas. And there's snow in the foreground. Again, I get to play a level mostly blind.    I play through to the end of the game to it's credit, but there's so many questionable design choices here. The combat ranges from boring and repetetive to plain unfair, with enemies blurring together to superior numbers and getting extended periods of invulnerability for them as the game progresses. The story's a joke, the voice acting is ear grating, some of the control choices feel unintuitive.....  I wanted to like this game. It's a visual treat for the first couple of areas, while you can actually see anything. And the characters are endearing at first, in that cheesy overdramatic anime way. But once I was done, I wasn't excited to comb through for more treasure or finish any quests. I just uninstalled, happy that the game was over and out of my life. If I'd bought it full price, I'd have been extremely upset. As is, I picked it up for less than 4 dollars, and that seems about right.",

Given that I didn't finish the game, please take this review with a grain of salt.  Positives: There are some things to like about this game. The combat is actually pretty good. Many of the moves have a satisfying feeling to them, and you can tell that a lot of love went into designing this aspect of the game. The background art is also quite lovely, and the main character looks quite good (when viewed from afar!) I also like that there's a nice amount of challenge on hard mode.  Negatives: As I said, the art is quite nice when viewed from afar. Unfortunately, this game has many cutscenes which plaster large character portraits all over the screen. And these portraits are terribly drawn, and hideously colored. The amateurish nature of this art really detracts from the overall presentation of the game. The story also has the same problem... the writing feels straight out of a Saturday morning cartoon, complete with obnoxious side-kicks and cringeworthy jokes.  But hey, you can skip the cutscenes. A bad story shouldn't hold a game back too much. And I was doing precisely that, but I still found that I wasn't enjoying the game much. Another problem is the in-game soundtrack. Let's talk about why the original Metroid is such a great game... one reason is the fantastic soundtrack which is simulteneously memorable and atmospheric. It not only creates a perfect mood, but by being memorable, it bonds with every area you explore, giving that area it's own identity. Dust: An Elysian Tail doesn't know how to do this. The music in every area sounds generic and boring. It lacks flavor, it lacks atmosphere, it is never memorable, and it never lends any of the areas a sense of identity. Therefore, every area you explore in Dust feels the same. They look different, but they feel exactly like the last area with a new paint job. Bad Metroid-likes have a tendency to make you feel like you're just going through the motions, dilligently filling out your mini-map without really enjoying yourself. Unfortunately this is one of those games.  The rather good combat isn't enough to counter-balance this. The most essential element of a Metroid-like is to make exploration feel fun and exciting. Dust fails to do so.  Overall: I like the combat. I like the general in-game look. But I don't like the music, or the story, or the feel of the game. I don't think the game does anything to elevate itself over the glut of so many indie Metroid-likes. I would not call this game 'bad,' but I would certainly call it mediocre. Some people may really like this game... if the story and artwork appeals to you, then I can certainly understand why you might enjoy it more than me. But I honestly feel that few people would call this a particularly special or interesting Metroid-like.  About my rating system: I have two things I rate on. Overall score, and soundtrack. Personally, I feel like game soundtracks are tremendously undervalued; to me, it's a vital factor in getting me into the game. For the score, I grade on a scale of 1-10, and I try to grade in such a way that each number has a meaning and equal importance. The meaning of each number are as follows:  0: Garbage, 1: Awful, 2: Poor, 3: Underwhelming, 4: Mediocre, 5: Decent, 6: Good, 7: Great, 8: Excellent, 9: Phenomenal, 10: Masterpiece  Dust: An Elysian Tail's score:  Game Rating: 4 (Mediocre) Soundtrack Rating: 3 (Underwhelming)",

And while there is a crafting system and rpg elements which allow for some customization, it barely has any affect on the game. The combat quickly becomes a chore and is entirely uninteresting. The story is completely forgettable, so much so you will constantly read ahead of the mandatory subtitles thankfully allowing you to move past the grating voice over work. There are a lot of below average elements to this game. Chapter 2 stands out as one of the worst and the game delays the Double Jump ability for far too long, making the sub-par platforming even more unbearable.

I haven't finished the game, and I know that's how it goes down.    - Some ♥♥♥♥ing annoying enemy types I though had died out forever with the 2D Castlevanias - Feels like a 00s side-scrolling metroidvania flash game  + Combat system is okay-ish, little button mashy but mostly solid + Plays okay on a controller   Don't bother with this even on sale.

This game is a hack 'n' slash / platformer that ultimately fails at both. The main problem with this game is that everything is oversimplified. The platforming has absolutely no difficulty, as the jumps are enormous.   As for the combat, you have like 3 or 4 different 'combos'. Considering that 90% of the game you will be fighting hordes of enemies, this becomes a major flaw. You will repeat the same attacks over and over and over. And after a certain point, it's not funny anymore. It could have been saved if at least there was some variety among the enemies. However, while having lots of awesome models for them, they all have pretty similar mechanics. Most of the time, you just need to attack them straightforward. There's no tactics at all. There are not different approachs, not even when fighting bosses.  Another point where the game fails is at progression. There's no sense of advance at all. You get some 'world skills', like crawling through small tunnels or double jump, but they do not bring anything new; no challenge, no variation. When killing bosses you also get some 'combat skills' that in the end are all the same area attack.   The story is a big meh. Generic for the most of it, just with a small twist near the end, but not enough to save it. The voice acting is overall good. As I said before, the best part of the game is the art. The graphics are ♥♥♥♥in' amazing and unique, and the main characters feel integrated in the environment (the enemies not so much). This is far beyond what a normal indie game achieves, but it's done at the expenses of all the other aspects of the game.   But overall, I don't consider the game can be saved. It lacks so much meaningful content. The main story lasts about eight hours, but I would have prefered it lasted half the hours and had something to fill them.",

The OSX port was also rather janky in parts, all of the cutscenes were broken and were at least 15 seconds out of sync with the audio, and although there is 1440p support, it looks terrible the way that certain elements such as the overworld map having large unaligned black boxes where the pieces of background art obviously just end while the screen doesn't.  It's a few hours of dumb fun, but I wouldn't recommend it.

But it seems this was their (main) focus when developing, and so ignored character substance which you will see at the end when you go, 'I wish I knew more about this person.' and so be left pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off if you thought you were going to get something more. The Story wont last long there are only 5 chapters so things will move on quickly after a few hours if you ignore sidequests and all.  During the first few chapters you get introduced to a nice array of special techniques that can cause some serious damage with combo's to the 400+ range with enough mobs on the screen you are treated very often to this kind of battle and is enjoyable trying to go higher and higher. The combat is very limited and I found that I just stuck to the same damage dealing combo which would deal with any boss quite easily *which are also pretty poor*  If you also heavily dislike annoying sidekicks like I do Fidget will very likely irritate you through the whole game and this without the option to turn your sword or silence her once and for all...  If you like storylines stay away from this because you will be left disappointed, if you like hack and slash with no limit to your power this is the game for you. For £3.50 it was a 'goodish' buy for what it's worth, but with a deeper storyline and maybe triple the length I would of said that was a steal, but sadly I feel for anybody who paid something like £10 for this very, very average game.

            "review_text": "DeviantART and FurAffinity got together to produce the single most unsatisfying metroidvania ever made, and like both those communities the quality of this game largely depends on which part you happen to be looking at at the time. This goes for everything from the art assets to the music to the animation and writing (but never the plot, the plot is consistently terrible).   A good first example is your main character(s), Dust and Fidget. They're fairly well drawn (most of the time), and while they aren't the most original characters (brooding amnesiac warrior, blue, and comedic animal sidekick, orange) you actually enjoy moving them around the screen! Their animations are fluid, and Fidget's body shifts to fly against things like a strong wind or to keep up with you when you're moving fast. You can tell that a lot of work was put into them, which is why I have to wonder why so much work was put into making them as hard to see as possible. You'll be fighting in pitch-dark caverns, or raging blizzards, or with the camera zoomed all the way out, the random weather effects have a preference for torrential downpours every fifteen seconds, and with all this on top of the tons of enemies and various weapon and attack effects (theirs and yours) it's a wonder the game runs half as well as it does with as much as there is on screen. The level shown in the fourth screenshot on the store page is probably the worst offender, because in addition to the ugliest enemies in the game it introduced scads of allies  and  everything is either exploding or on fire,  and  some of the enemies are   invisible copies of yourself (invisible enemies not shown)  .   There are more problems than not being able to see the good animations, and those include being able to see the bad. You can't tell from the still image, but the deer in the first screenshot on the store page move like something from Scribblenauts or South Park; they don't seem to move their knees and you can see where the legs on the rig meet the body and it's such a jarring transition from the seamless little bunnies from just a screen earlier. Likewise, the town guards in Vaguely Asiatic Villiage are a jerky collection of bodyparts brought into unlife by Flash and commanded to randomly bend over and pick up invisible objects, the end result a bit like a marionette being controlled by a butterfingered puppeteer. By far, though, the worst offenders are the soldiers and spaceships of the volcano level. Just look at the fourth screenshot on the store page, and look how jarring that CG-rendered spaceship looks compared to the hand-drawn enemies and environments from every other screenshot. Now imagine that in motion! It's something straight out of A Valley Without Wind, and I can't understand what would lead them to add such a thing. There's no lead up to CG-rendered space ships, there are no indicators that CG-rendered space ships will be making an appearance, and there's nothing you can do about it.   The phrase 'there's nothing you can do about it' actually segues into my biggest complaint, the empty feeling this game's plot leaves you with. Despite the bright colors, lush backgrounds, and (occasionally) cute furry characters, Elysia or Falana or whatever Not-Asia is called is a dark, depressing world. Everything you do is met with failure as part of the game's theme of 'even when you do everything right, you can't fight fate'. And while I can understand the creator was in a bad place when he made this game, it creates a sort of dissonance in the tone of the game when you have genuinely laugh-out-loud banter alongside a furry analogue for the holocaust. When I remember the scenes with Dust and Fidget poking fun at each other or breaking the fourth wall, or even taking some beautifully-aimed jabs at other indie games, it hurts, because they took characters we actually cared about, the  only two  characters we cared about, ran them through the grimmest, darkest plot they could find, and still expected us to care, even when the plot didn't make any sense, even when the plot never made any sense. By the end of the game, when you're met with another failure in a string of horrible failures, you're not even relieved it's over because you still have so many darn questions! Why were any of the events in the game occuring? Why did anyone, at any point in time, think that any of your actions mattered? Why did anyone tell you they mattered? They didn't, and the game drives it on home every other step of the way that they didn't, except for side quests which somehow matter within the confines of the sidequest, and are coincidentally where all the game's good dialogue, and its heart, lie.    Why were there spaceships?  ",

I felt like that would have some bad implications down the line.   But the real kicker was the chest. Second screen in, locked chest. 5 screens later through a ton of trash, you find a key. Then to go back to the chest you wade through those same 5 screens with respawned trash, open the chest to get a piece of fruit, then wade back through the same 5 screens full of respawned trash.

It adds a lot to the overall game experience.    RPG-Element:  While the RPG part of Dust wasn't completely necessary I did still enjoy it. Very straight forward and simple.   What I did not like about Dust:     Dialogue:  For me, personally, the Dialogue between the characters often seemed a bit forced. I did like the story enough to still talk to all the characters and read the Dialogue but often I found it to be rather awkward conversations.   My mixed feelings about Dust:     Story/Characters:  For most people I guess the story is a bit too cheesy. Overall I still liked the story, maybe because I'm a sucker for that but it was interesting enough for me to keep up with it all they way until the end. As for the characters, some were great, others not so much. But that's a personal preference.     Combat system:  I honestly thought that the combat system was great. If you level up your character like I did and fight your way through the game with sword combos it's very rewarding and fun. However, towards the end I did discover a certain combo that makes the whole combat system redundant, since you can kill everything with a two-key-combo.    Conclusion  Overall a very solid, enjoyable game that I would definitely play again and do not regret buying. Considering that most of the game was made by a single guy makes it even more impressive.

The story itself is not the best story you can find in gaming history but I found it very enjoyable to follow. From the slow-paced beginning of 'Who Am I?' until the very end, all are well-paced in my opinion. Characters are childish in some moments but didn't pass the point of annoyance. In fact, I found the combination of Dust and Fidget amusing.  Combat is another plus of this game. There are several skills, but you will find yourself mostly using   Dust Storm   combined with   Fidget's projectile skills; air(?), fire, and electric, which provides different styles of offensive  . However, there are no precise strategies to counter a certain enemy. (Well, most are defeatable by spamming the attack button and probably   parrying in some point of the game  , but what fun will it be? It will be so boring!)  All in all, Dust: An Elysian Tail is totally worth its price. 9.5/10",

Figure 12-18 hours to beat it, which is nice for those of us who don't have mondo amounts of time to sink into a game. This game works for adults...but honestly it's better for a preteens and below who aren't jaded yet. The game does deal with death. It's not a love story. It's a story about heros and villians, friends and enemies, friendship and hate. It's an epic without the epic timesink.  I recommend it. It was fun, it lived up to, and after playing lots of indie games, it exceeded my expectations of what an indie game can pull off.

With Ahrha, a talking and magic sword, and Fidget, a cute nimbat, the three will go on a journey together, fighting monster all around. And so... Dust's quest has begun. The story is quite interesting, especially near the end and the truth is revealed. As for the game itself, that's a good 2D platform game, and we explore beautiful and mysterious places. The music in this game is fantastic, it's just... So beautiful! I especially love the music in the glade, the first place we explore after the intro. There are also many sidequests to do, and we can get many rewards like item, money and experience. Battles are pretty neat as well, using your sword and combining your attacks with Fidget in order to crush your ennemies. Think it's possible to get a combo of 1000? Well, we some training and skills, it's definitely possible. There are also some challenges and many treasures to find, so, it you love exploration, go ahead and enjoy the music and background while you're exploring. There are many references and cameos from various others games. As for the difficulty, well, I played the game twice, once in the normal difficulty and once in the hardest difficulty. Difficulty is quite reasonable though, in the hardest difficulty, it was challenging and I died a few times too. So, this is good somehow, it's not too easy, not too hard, that's perfect.  Now, the game is more or less short, only five chapters (with a prologue) and four bosses. But there are many places to explore and many sidequests to complete as well. Hmm... I have the feeling the game miss something, I kinda wish they were more somehow, I don't know what does it miss though. Oh well... And who knows? Maybe we'll have a sequel and I wouldn't mind at all.

It's a classic tale, to be sure, but it still succeeds in taking the familiar and making it unique, clever, and memorable. The cast is colorful and lively, resulting in natural interactions that really help to establish the world around the characters. The humor is genuine and witty, the intense moments are properly gripping, and the two never clash. Every event has its time in the spotlight and gets its due attention. And when the climactic parts take the stage, they truly steal the show. It was at these highs that I felt the most astounded.   But, of course, there's the gameplay. The wonderful, flowing, visceral mechanics that really complete this epic. The eponymous hero, Dust, controls like the warrior you've always dreamed of. He's agile, acrobatic, and swings his sword with ferocity and grace. The controls are intuitive, combat always feels rich and rewarding, and I never felt a cheap death or a fight unfair. If anything, the fiends in this world never stood a chance. There's nothing more satisfying than cutting through hordes of enemies, launching them to the heavens, and sending them into oblivion with the combined power of sword and sorcery. You really feel the gravity of every power, ability, and upgrade you get, and it's great to backtrack and rediscover new places in secrets in old maps. And even better when you're clever enough to discover them early! The game never lets you down or leaves you bored, or wanting more than it can deliver. It's fun, challenging, and cinematic. Dust is worth every cent and second invested in this epic tale.",

There are a few decision points that might affect the story, but don't seem to; even those are rare enough to be surprising when they come up.  Combat is simple, even repetitive, once you get the hang of it, and the world is small enough to explore fully, after gaining a few movement abilities. Mashing buttons works well enough to entertain a child, and the story progresses quickly enough to entertain adults. Save points are frequent, and most supplies are plentiful with the shopkeeper's help, so there's little danger of actually losing.  The nods to other games can feel a bit out of place at times, but all work within the framework of Dust's skill set, and are amusing when you understand the reference. They're also out of the way, though you'll probably run across most of them while looking for something else.  So, is this game for kids, or for adults? For novice gamers, or for the indie in-crowd? Perhaps both, for each question. I wouldn't recommend it for hard-core gamers who value gameplay far beyond storyline, but for the rest of us, it's a fun way to spend a few evenings.",

            "review_text": "Once upon a time there was a young dude watching his YouTube Subscriptions, when he decided to look at the solo channels of a collaboration group he subscribed to. He checked out the Animator/Reviewer of the group, who had started an 'Indie-Theme' for his current set of reviews. Among this list was a little game know as Dust: An Elysian Tail. Intrigued by the gameplay, the young dude payed no attention to reviewer himself and decided he would make it his goal to play this game eventually. About a month passed and the young dude finds himself scrolling through the 'I Can Has Cheezburger' app's 'Video Games' section to find a video on something he never heard of... a 'Humble Bundle'. Not caring too much the dude nearly passes it, when his eyes catch the words 'Dust: An Elysian Tail', 'Gianna Sisters' and 'Pay what you want'. So curiously, he clicked the presented link. The very next day he found himself with a good set of new games, probably more than $50 in value, for just $4.29. While Dust wasn't the first game he played, it was the one he loved the most... And that is my Dust Story. Now time for the actual review: Dust: An Elysian Tail... Dust... An Elysian... Tail? Not Tale? Is it a play on words? Like 'A Link to the Past' was? Eh, whatever... So this game is a 'Platformer' + 'Hack 'n Slash' + 'Metroid-Vania', with hints of RPG. And it plays great! While it uses the common misconception of 'Full' gamepad support (Full should not mean 'Xbox 360/Xinput' only, it should mean, 'Anything with enough recognizable buttons'), I never found myself using a gamepad. But regardless it still controls BEAUTIFULLY!... Ya know? I could just use that word to describe this whole game... Anyway, my only control gripe was that Dust feels a bit slippery. Not much, but a bit. The Visuals, Oh [insert your higher being of authority here] it is BEAUTIFUL! If I understand correctly this entire game was hand painted, and damn does it show. And the animation is just so fluid! Sure I can do simple button maniplutaion (Example: Rapidly hitting left and right) to make Dust spaz out, but when I'm not screwing about, it animates like a feature film. Now for the sound. As someone who can and will mute an entire game just to not hear terrible voice work (I'm looking at you, Sonic Colors and above in the Sonic Franchise), I found great enjoyment from the soundtrack and voice overs this game provides. The Voices never got annoying to me, and it wasn't until the end of the game that I found myself skiping repeated sentences (I.E. entering and exiting the shop), for the sake of getting a move on. So using that word again, this Audio is BEAUTIFUL! Now for the Story... While I've heard some people complain it sounded generic, I can't recall a single game, or movie, or T.V. show, or story in general that has a concept similar to this. Then again, out side of the gaming realm, I pretty much live under a rock. Without spoiling anything, in regards to the end of this story, I would of had a bit more emotion to it... If I didn't guess it about 1/2 through the game. And it wasn't even an educated guess, I just wung it. Now in terms of other aspects, I haven't played many XBLA games that were ported to PC, but from what I have seen through internet searches, these kinds of ports don't shine to well, with this game being a diamond in the rough. Ported excellently to PC, Mac, and Linux (and soon PS4). Now for the finals, is it worth it's $15 asking price?... Well considering I got this from a Humble Bundle (I don't even think I paid for 5% of the game's price, evenly splitting the $4.29 I spent to get all the games in the bundle), I don't think I'm the most qualified to determine that. But what I can say, is the day a sequel is announced, I will pre-order it no matter what the price... This game has earned it's spot in my library as my Favorite Indie Game (Tied with Cave Story).  Well, I think I've chewed your ears (eyes? It's text, not speech... would eyes work better in this context?) off enough. Buy. This. Game. Beautiful in every regard.  ~Sonny",

            "review_text": "*Heavy Sigh*   Let me first start by saying this Gem started off as a 'It's on sale so why not?' purchase that has dramatically changed my view of 2D Sidescrollers forever.   Artwork: 10 / 10   The bread &amp; butter for the majority of players. This game is gorgeous to behold at any given point of the journey. The Hand painted textures simply turn this adventure into that storybook adventure you always dreamt about. The forest are full of life thanks to animated backgrounds &amp; a bright color pallet. Even the dreaded marshes and volcanic regions of the world feel vivid and full of personality thinks to these details.   Gameplay 10 / 10   Silky Smooth &amp; Flashy! Words cannot describe the swordplay in this one. The majority of your attacks seem infused with the spirit of the wind and the visuals reflect this. The screen fills with various distortions and mirror images of your lighting fast slashes that seem to cut away at the air itself.   The puzzles of the game mostly involve destroying barriers with hovering bomb fruit that follow you due to your signature move DUST (IE they follow the wind you create). Their are small jumping puzzles over spike pits or lava at times as well. It is never enough to frustrate the player so fear not!  As you may have read the game plays out on a 2D stage, but thanks to multiple paths it feels deep and the areas meaningful as you journey threw them.   Story 9/10   Many have claimed the story to be cliche and a bit predictable; I did not see this in the least bit. The plot moved along nicely and kept me guessing along the way. While I was somewhat close at guessing the Antagonist true identity and background information, I was never spot on.  Play for the story, stay for THE CUT SCENES!!!!  The cut scenes MAKE this game in my honest opinion; dialogue between you, your blade Ahrah and your companion Fidget ensures you talk to everyone to hear what your companions have to add to the conversation. The cut scenes are presented beautifully by focusing on the speaker at the time, giving you that 'storybook' feeling as you converse your way threw the world.   Characters 9/10   I know I know how can I rank the cast of a game I've only seen for 10-ish hours against the likes of hero's like commander Shepard or Link? Easily, threw solid voice acting &amp; a superb personality! Dust (Main Character) plays the part well of someone trying to find who he is or what he needs to be doing considering waking up with no memory of who or what he was before he woke up in the forest grove.   His companion Fidget (Think Navi 10.0 Except Useful / Cute / &amp; Slightly OP ) provides the comic relief threw out your journey. You WILL talk to everyone just to hear what she has to add to the conversation I promise you that =).  Even your sword Ahrah has a few memorable lines threw out the game. The rest of the NPCs scattered threw out the land are a joy to talk to, each with their own personality and colors so things never get dull.   Music 9/10   You will love the soundtrack. Its upbeat when it needs to be for the boss battles and fits in well with whatever your environment is. I've even downloaded the soundtrack because their are a few songs that either move you or leave you with fond memories. I've no complaints at all in this department.   To Summarize I'm giving this one an oddly rounded up 10/10!    For the sale price I got it for (5.00$ ish) I can think of nothing better. I've never been one to enjoy side scrollers but this one changed all that for me. Thanks to the solid voice acting, the charming characters, aw inspiring artwork &amp; flashy game play I've never been happier*  *Possible Spoilers About Ending: You Have Been Warned =3 *    As a final note I thought about not recommending this one at all...  It was one of the only games among thousands that I had played that when I finished I had to spend the ENTIRE night reading fan fiction about alternative endings because I was crushed with how things ended up. I was that emotionally attached to the characters &amp; that in love with the world around me.     They say sometimes that life is about the journey and not your destination; I believe that and without a doubt I wished this story had never ended....  Ashes to Ashes my Friends,  Onxius",

            "review_text": "This is going to be a longer than usual review than I usually do, but I'll summarize this game now before I dig into that: Acceptable. General: My biggest complaint about this game is that it falls under 'You get what you pay for', much like Earth Defense Force, Shoot Many Robots, and other cheap knockoff games. Story: Now, Dust has a lot riding behind it. This is perhaps root of most of the game's problems plot-wise, because a lot of the lore in the game is barely touched. It also ends with a questionable cliff hanger, again bringing up more questions behind it. As far as the actual story is concerned, it's paced up until a given point and hinted on deeply until you reach said point - Inwhich vague, general background details are (optionally) given to the player. The story is average here, certainly not bad. The dubbing in many cases, as well as character expressions, isn't as pleasing as one would expect - Though it is /slightly/ bareable. Gameplay: Takes some getting used to, the combat system is easy to master. In fact, it's easily abused - Especially on normal difficulty. This game combines platforming and combat, but is more focused as a fast-paced side-scrolling beat-em-up. There exists stage hazards which also must be avoided. The leveling system is also very generous, but balanced so that one get too far ahead too early. Overall: The game scores a 8/10. I have a second issue with this game: It's way too damn easy if played with a sharp mind. I should not be killing the final boss 3 times over only to get hit by him 5 times. When you posses attacks which can deal 1,500 damage per tick on a boss with 60,000, and it area of effect is that of pretty much the whole screen, I can't help but feel my breif back-and-forth sidequesting may have been a bit excessive towards the game's progression - An issue which falls in alignment with my first, this is expected.",

The only reason I bought this game was because it looked like a decent game, but with furries!

The game itself is beautiful, I find the art style very nice, the animation is very smooth, and those bunnies are absolutely adorable. The story is incredibly gripping and quite powerful, I found myself often playing far longer than I planned to find out what happens next, much like a good book, I couldn't put this game down on many occassions. I loved almost every character in this game, and in spite of the 'edgy' factor of the main character, I didn't see any character as annoying or to be avoided. (While generally being 'edgy' is a negative thing when it comes to serious stories, with Dust it was just fun). The opinions of Fidget seem to be about 50/50 love/hate, though I'm on the 50% of those that love her, I think she's adorable, and even though she has her moments early game where she is a tiny bit annoying, through most of the game I thought she was a great companion.  I beat the game finally about a half hour ago, and I'm still wiping the tears from my eyes.  Even though the final boss took me so many tries and got a tiny bit tedious, since I decided to play on Tough difficulty on my first time, I kept going at it because I was so desperate to know how it ended.

Also fun to play.  + Beautiful character, level and combat art; organic looks + Okay voice-acting + Good story + Metroidvania + Fading out overlay where obfuscating avatar except for really important stuff 0 Dynamic zoom sometimes make battle harder than necessary - No Inn (100% hp) - Scenes need multi-skips because animation cannot be skipped - No restart for challenges! - Digital analogue stick, either no movement or full speed - Auto-equipping food to quick-use slot; vanishing items/loot; automatic item-consumption - Slipping of edges after jumps  Hint: There is are two decision-based achievements. In order to get them manually save before entering Ivydale Glen or on the first save point you encounter there.  I was immediately enamoured with the game when only a minute or so into the gameplay breaking a wall gave me an insight into the developers humour   by providing me with the 'mysterious wall chicken'  . When seeing others play the game I was already impressed with the game's design but doubted gameplay would be tight and fun. Fortunately my doubts proved baseless.  Controls are basically very tight and fluid except for one major flaw and a few more or less seldom occurring situations. Overall playing with a controller is pretty much the same as playing with keyboard and mouse, i.e. one didn't feel better than the other. The major controls thing is that movement speed is controlled digitally as opposed to analogue, i.e. when using a controller and moving with the analogue stick the avatar is either not moving or moving full speed (which is also not very fast). When platforming you need to stand for some time on a platform in order to be able to jump from it, i.e. having one platform above another and to its side you cannot swiftly jump from the lower platform to the close edge of the higher platform and, changing direction, jump again right away - that will always be considered a drop. Blocking is an essential part of combat and you are told you need to face the enemy but it's not always possible to change the character's direction in time. Furthermore, it seems the enemy also has to face you. There are some bigger enemies that may be distracted and attack away from you thus backhanding you without the chance to block. The character will gain a dash ability which allows for quick evasive manoeuvres. Unfortunately, this cannot effectively be used to pursue an enemy which drew back since immediately following with an attack will have the avatar automatically attack in the direction opposing the dash direction as opposed to attacking in the direction the player indicates with the analogue stick. A few times battle was made harder than necessary when graphical foreground elements obfuscated avatar and enemies or when the dynamic zoom goes in so far that the tells for incoming attacks cannot be seen, the latter being a problem with the final boss.  I demand total control over use of items so I feel somewhat angry at the game for effectively not letting me disable consumables. You can deselect the current consumable but as soon as you collect another it will automatically be assigned to the quick-use slot. Additionally, the game automatically uses Revival Stones when dying and automatically gives away crafting supplies when that can advance a current quest. In theory, I'd like to save up Revival Stones for boss fights but since the game has some enemies being able to one-shot you the stones are often wasted on underlings. With enemies like that I deemed consumables useless and never healed except for testing at the beginning of the game, the occasional bump of controller against my desk and save points that heal up to a certain percentage of total HP (depending on your difficulty level). Later on, you will receive equipment with regenerative attributes. The game indicates when it deems the avatar close to death which is basically nice but irritating over longer periods, read the whole beginning of the games. That's why I think the threshold for 'is dying' should always be lower than what the save points heal you to. I feel like changing regions in the game should fill up your HP or there should be some kind of Inn that lets you sleep and heal up.  I like games that let you skip sequences. This game has that to a degree. You can skip dialogue but only dialogue. You still have to wait through any intro, outro or intermediate animation. This also may require you to skip more than one dialogue per sequence. When dying in quick succession I felt like the death animation was sort of celebrated too much and I wanted to be able to just skip to loading. Somewhat related, the challenges could use a reset button bringing you back to the start of the challenge for when you know you can't achieve the wanted ranking in the current run.  Some more minor bickering: Sometimes loot gets stuck inside walls even rewards from destroying static objects. I don't see a reason loot should ever vanish as long as you don't leave the 'room', i.e. the area shown as one location in the minimap. Here, loot is gone after something like 10 or 15 seconds. I think it adds to the flow of the game that loot jumps around a bit. Then again, I was aggravated by loot often jumping over my head. And why doesn't Dust Storm simply collect loot instead of randomly flipping it around? The player cannot leave a room if enemies are close, that's okay. However it's not okay that enemies can leave the players attack range by leaving the edge of the room. Why would you have more than one blueprint of anything or be able to sell more than one? It seems blueprints are acting as high-value loot which doesn't really compute.  Some more praise: If for some reason the avatar is where HUD elements go the HUD becomes see-through except for essential information like low HP - very well done. Again, design feels like it has received some love. Regions have different designs and apart from where you expect otherwise, i.e. with built-up structures, the levels look very organic, i.e. they do not feel lazily pieced together from some palette. And there are atmospheric elements that show effort over simply making a playable game, e.g. wild life or footsteps in the snow. The Ugly pendant is a really nice fix. It allows to get that one achievement even in late game. Thanks for that.  Dust: An Elysian Tail is one more very easily recommendable game, even if you are already somewhat tired of platformers.",

Even simpler: RPG-Action vs. Action-RPG.   Secondly: the images/videos are a little blurry/grainy. The game's visuals are clean and pleasantly detailed. The only visuals I found off-putting were the couple of hand-drawn cutscenes, but even those weren't... 'bad.'  Pros: - Fast, smooth action - Quirky, lighthearted... even when trying to be serious. - Responsive controls - 20 Hours Long - A 'decent' number of quests - A 'decent' amount of equipment to collect  Cons: - Weak endgame: once you're done, not much reason to continue - Sometimes painful dialogue (thankfully, skippable)",

Gameplay difficulty: Playing on tough is not that much more difficult than playing on standard; however, I feel like I just had to grind a lot. Honestly, if you bought this game for the storyline, I would suggest skipping the tough and difficult levels and just playing through on easy; you'll get the story much quicker.

            "review_text": "I'm going to open up this review by being straight up honest: I'm not a big platform game fan. I don't hate them, but they really aren't my favorite genre. This is why it's taken me so long to get around to playing Dust. That being said, Dust has two major pluses going for it over other platformers for me. One is that the actual platforming elements are fairly simple and straightforward, and even the 'tricky' portions are not the type to be super frustrating. The other is that it is a Metroidvania type game, which I am much more tolerant of anyway.  To be blunt, this game is really good. It has a generally good pacing, with some minor but not game-ruining exceptions, and on top of that the story is actually engaging and interesting, which is an unusual thing for any platforming game I've played before. The combat is fast-paced without being overwhelming, and the difficulty is easily adjusted to the player's level of skill, though hardcore action gamers may find the game a little easy for them. It is one of those games you look forward to playing when you get home, eager to see what the next level or revelation brings, and it's a breath of fresh air amongst the first person shooter crowd. While hardly the only side-scroller these days, it's a testament to how high-quality indie games can be.  This isn't to say it's perfect. The game's RPG elements, while interesting, are not particularly deep. The crafting system requires either a lot of grinding to utilize fully, or can be ignored entirely, which means that it either needs work or should be removed entirely. Finally, some of the sidequests require some real snooping around even above and beyond what is expected, making them a little frustrating.  On the whole, these complaints are exceedingly minor though. It boils down to this being a very fun game worth 15-20 hours, and at the current price it's a steal.",

I played through the game on hardcore from the beginning, which is why I have 39 hours of gameplay! As a matter of fact, I just finished the game for the first time before writing this review. If I had the difficulty down the game probably wouldn't have taken nearly as long for me to complete, but I think that the challenge added to the experience and would highly recommend playing on hardcore difficulty (Although geting OHKOed by a number of enemies can be pretty frustrating).  What stands out the most about this game is the consistently amazing level of quality. Throughout my playthrough of the game there was not a single moment where it felt like the developers took shortcuts or ran out of ideas. It is an amazing ride from start to finish.

            "review_text": "In the gaming climate as of late, two things are regarded as near constants. The first is that indie games have small development teams, while the second is that any game which has a longer-than-usual development cycle never turns out to live up to expectations (we're looking at you, Timeshift and Duke Nukem Forever).  Dust: An Elysian Tail basically takes the cake on both counts.  With the exception of the voice acting and the music design, everything in Dust: AET was done by a single person. Dean Dodrill took the artwork, animation, coding, storyline and even the creation of a PC version he deemed worthy of release and spent nearly half a decade getting the job done.  And it definitely shows, but not how you'd expect. Dust: AET is, indie job or no, one of the most well-polished and complete 2D MetroidVania-style games to grace the PC. To find something 'better' for our trusty desktops/laptops, you technically have to break the law and go trawling for roms.  While the anthropomorphic/'furry' aesthetic may be something of a turn-off for some, the artistic style of the characters in this game is like the sprite-based graphics of Terraria, a choice made by the developer (and the singular is actually correct in this instance) and nothing more.   Scratch beneath it and you get the usual trappings of the MetroidVania world; a gradual widening of the protagonist's repertoire, the need to backtrack and revisit locations to satisfy the needs of the completionist and so on, all wrapped up with an RPG-esque level-up and equipment system and garnished with over-the-top (at least on Dust's part) combat that wouldn't look out of place in the love-child of Devil May Cry and Streets of Rage.  At the end of the day, Dust: AET is an absolute blast to play and, even at its full price, I'd say it's worth it.",

The game wisely borrows elements that worked in both Metroid and Castlevania while retaining its own identity, with plenty of small but substantial additions to the formula, such as quests, crafting elements, and new movement abilities. The most significant change is to the combat system, which takes more of a spectacle-fighter approach that encourages you to string together large combos without being hit.  The game's visual style is truly striking, with lush colors and highly-detailed environments. While the animated cutscenes aren't quite on the same level, the actual in-game animation is quite good. The voice-acting and music are fairly well done, if ultimately a little unmemorable.  Dust isn't without its faults, to be sure. For a completionist like me, the Normal difficulty started off reasonably challenging, but gradually dropped in the face of high levels and the best items. The story can also be a little hit-or-miss at times. Finally, a couple of the puzzles are also a little obnoxious, partly because the unusual flight ability sometimes seems like the solution when it isn't, and one puzzle where the in-game hint is almost no help at all (I ultimately had to look it up).  Still, I had a lot of fun with Dust - it comes highly recommend to any Metroidvania or platformer fans.",

            "review_text": "8/10 First I'll cover the good things. The combat flows very nicely, is fast paced, and very cathartic, but not too easy as to be a meaningless obstacle. Levelling up feels good with that little bit of knockback the character takes, and since each 'skill gem' gives your character a sizeable increase in power. The crafting system is easy to handle and the shop system works well to provide you with health items and crafting materials. My favorite part of the game is the art. The environments are colorful and distinct, and the animation is superb. The things I have mentioned constitute the majority of the game experience, so if you want a fast-paced, beautifully drawn metroidvania, it's all there.  Now the bad things. There is too much dialogue. It helps advance the story and give it a deeper plot with good characters and a motive to do what you're doing, but I don't think that much dialogue fits in such a fast-paced game. In the levels you dash from room to room, monster to monster, just hacking your way through everything, and suddenly you encounter an NPC who eats up at least 5 minutes of your time. Now the solution wouldn't be to reduce the dialogue because that would weaken the world and the story. It would be better to slow the pace of the game just a little bit. You are able to dispose of most monsters without putting too much effort into it and once you get the hang of it you just fly around the screen dicing up monsters like a salad. If there were more variety in how you take down monsters, like those spectres that are only vulnerable to spell damage, working through levels would be at a better pace. In order not to slow down backtracking, you could reduce the overall number of monsters. So, even though the time it takes to clear a stage may be about the same, the pace is different. The abilities you get as the game progresses are neither creative nor game-changing once you get them. Each spell is immediately better than the last, so the lightning is just better than the fire or 'baseballs' as I've come to call the first spell. The movement abilities like the double-jump only serve the purpose of allowing you to progress. The best abilities are gained towards the beginning. Some people don't like the bosses, but I thought they were fine. The similar size to you gives it more of a 'duel' feel rather than a 'underdog' feel.  Even after all that, I still think it's a good game. The dialogue is even remedied a little by the ability to skip dialogue scenes, even though you miss some plot. First playthrough with completing some sidequests and doing a bit of backtracking to find treasures is about 10 hours for me.",

I love the playstyle, the voice acting and plot, and was deeply immersed into a world that is beautiful, but can be silly and scary. Mouse click combinations to attack makes this super easy to play and really fun. I adore racking up combos and shooting weird faire magic at stuff and turning it into a storm of pure death. The backgrounds and character art are so well animated that I doubt anyone will care that this is a 2D game.  I am typlically not a fan of platformers. I am really terrible about over-jumping and landing on small platforms. This game has that and I got hella frustrated many times. Luckily it doesn't happen too often. Probably once or twice per area.  This game also features (mostly) pointless collectem and unnessicary side quests. I hop right on that crap, I am all about 100% game completion and returning to areas to gather more crap. Some of the collectem is helpful. Unlocking the 'friends' gives you permanent health bonuses. Chests get you fat stacks of cash and items. Finding all the keys (for previous things) can be challenging and rewarding to see that 100% area completion icon. I turn the whole map purple in saints row every time and modded every car. I know that most games don't have different completion endings anymore but I just get lots of satisfaction out of it.  That being said, there's also a ton of stuff you can skip if you just wanna play the game and forward the story line. This does make the game much shorter, from what is already not too long of a game in the first place. And once you know all the plot twists and turns, the game loses some of it's replay value. The battles aren't especially unique after a while so the intrgue is a very big driving force for the game. But the game is worth the first play through and perhaps to enjoy some years later or to let someone else enjoy. I'd call the game family friendly, just with some dark themes. PG13?   If you haven't experienced it yet, tottally grab it the next time it goes on sale.  Any fan of RPGs, mystery/intrgue, platformers, pretty backgrounds, and flying around with good old-fashioned hitting stuff with magical talking swords will enjoy this game.",

Nice story though a touch predictable at times. One personal critique:  ***Spoiler***  The ending is just a touch rushed whne you get to General Gaius and defeat him, it just feels a touch unwhelming for an end-boss... Also there was no feel of going back and wrapping up the unexplored areas like Castlevania games had, and I didn't want ot go just before the final fight and spend hours, so poor timing on only granting the last of the movement skills right at the end of the game.  ***Spoiler***  A worthwhile play.",

At first, you might think this is a childish looking game with a fun story, but after progressing further in the game, you find out that the story is really dark. A story of betrayal, hatred, anger, etc... And there's Fidget who accompanies you through the whole game. I appreciate her appearance in the game because it creates many greats moments, like reminding me to save my game before attempting a challenge or telling me to just mash the buttons after the first monster encounter! About the gameplay. Gameplay is incredible. It's like any other RPG (or Metroidvania) game I have played so far but with a little difference: some of the cages (Hidden collectibles) are placed in places that you cannot even imagine! Actually, I'm currently playing this game as my third playthrough(!) and only in this playthrough I managed to find Bandage Girl (from Super Meat Boy) and when I found the place, this was the first thing I said:   WHAT THE F###?!  . Also, combat is very simple to learn, but hard to master.  I really want to talk more about this game and how good it is, but playing it for yourself is way better than reading my review.",

Here is the 'bad': - Dust has few attack combos (but all of them are beautiful and funny); - there is a lot of backtracking, if you want to collect all the treasures.  My final rank for DUST = 9/10.

Story is great, but the writing lets it down. The ending left me with mixed feelings of looking forward to a sequel while also cringing at the poorly written end scene.

It's one the few games in the 2.5D hack and slash Metroidvania games that isnt just a 8 or 16bit art style. The art style is very reminiscant of the early to late 90's animation. Things like Disney Afternoon come to mind. Just done with a more modern flair.   The gameplay is spot on for this style of game. It controls like it should even if you use a keyboard and mouse. Tight responsive satasifying are the terms I'd use to describe it.   The writing in this game is okay its nothing to remember. However with that being said one charcter will stand out. Fidget can be at times annoying if you don't like that cute,annoying style. Me personally I like her.   Voice acting in this game is rather hit or miss. Dust is done well, so is Fidget but you can tell who has different equipment and not as much expernice being a Voice Actor in this game.   I will mention this game is inspired heavily by the furry fandom as well. However this mainly a taste thing. If you aren't really big on furries you may either love this game or hate it. The only real way to actually find out is to play it.   Scoring wise out of 10 Art: 9/10 Desgin: 7/10 Music: 8/10 Story: 5/10 Gameplay: 10/10 Voice Acting: 7/10 Overall : 7.5",

            "review_text": "Ok I don't usually do reveiws of games I've played..... but this game is somthing that has really raised the bar on my expectaions from both adventure and beat'em up games. You play as Dust in an Anthropomorphic world(Animal people). He awakes not knowing where or who he is. Then you are greeted and named by a floating talking sword called Arah. The sword's pint sized gaurdian Fidget shows up next. After a short exchange you sent off on an adventure.  Pro's:  1.This game has a very well executed combat system that results in Dust flying across the screen throwing out blows, casting magic spell, and using the Duststorm to rack up combo's and cause massive destruction to anything on screen. 2. Exploring never feels like a chore and you are ecouraged to come back to area's you have been through before to reach new areas to get loot and face challenge dungeons as you gain new abilities. 3. The RPG elements put into the game allow you to specialize Dust skills, but it will restrict you a bit only allowing a one skill to get so high allowing your others to catch up. Here is what I mean. The game has four base stats Attack,HP,Defense,and Fidget(magic/duststorm). Your have reached level five and you have put all your skill points into Attack. The skill tree will not allow you put a fifth point into atack until your other skills have all been brought up by one. This kind of system is put in so the player doesn't suffer from a handicap farther along in the game when enemy's are tougher. 4. The story will keep you engaged and the world that is it's setting is beautiful. Which bring me to my next point. 5.The entire game, except for a few enemies and your sword, is hand drawn. This type of graphical choice in a game is always refreshing and is something that many Triple A title's never do. (exept the current Rayman game) Con's: 1. I had very few problems with this game. One thing I wish would have been better is the map. It needed to be a little more detailed. A few labels here and there wouldn't hurt and the terrain should have been displayed. They didin't need to save space to prevent the game file from being too large. This could have been inpimented. 2. Sometime with all the crazyness going on on screen you can somtimes lose track of yourself in a mass of enemys. It doesn't happen often but it could result in you taking a hit ending your combo and loseing extra EXP. There is no way to fix that your character is already brightly colored. It's not much of a problem but it is there.  Verdict. This game is a good 12 hrs long if you play it how it is meant to be played. Doing a few side quest and exploring. This game is must play. 95/100.",

Dust: An Elysian Tail is a Metroidvania Jump'n'Run/Brawler with an awesome art style, an interesting story and quite a lot of content. It took me ~11 hours to beat the game once (on the second hardest difficulty with 100 % in all areas).  The story and characters (and especially your sidekick) are very anime or cartoon like, so if you are not into this, this game may not be for you. But it genuinely made me smile and laugh several times.  The controls and the combat are very responsive, though the combat does get stale with the time as you basically use the same 3 or 4 attacks over and over again. As one of these attacks is to swoosh through the air and letting magic projectiles, pillars of fire or lightning rain down on your opponents, it's still quite fun but don't expect to much depth here. Although on the higher difficulty setting, enemies hit really hard so you really want to dodge or counter the enemy attacks.  My main complain is maybe, that you have always A LOT of money to just buy health restoring items all day long so even challenging enemies are nothing to really wory about but at the end of the day, I really enjoyed the time I had with this game.",

I think you can already see from the images how beautiful the artwork in this game is. Truely something one will never tire of. The battling mechanisms are rather simple. You don't have a particularily large variety of attacks to use, but in my own expirience, I simply couldn't get enough of it. The enemies too, are rather simple, but this is not so much an issue as you're usually just mowing them down anyway, but when you're not, there's a prety decent variety to them. Then there's the script. THE SCRIPT OH YES. Oh man the characters in this game are incredible, I love them, I love them so much, really. The personalities are all very diverse, and the voice acting for the game is absolutely adorable. I won't say much on the plot to avoid spoilers, but it's capturing indeed, trust me on this.  SO!

            "review_text": "Oh my goodness. I finally beat this game and it was absolutely amazing! This is a must have game that everyone should play. This game is up on my top 5 favorite games and I'm considering it to be my number 1 game. Enough raving about this game, let's get down to the review! Game play is amazing and very smooth. Controls very well with an Xbox controller. At times, it could be headache inducing frustration trying to get to all the treasures and finding all the secret areas on the maps. I had to keep switching out of the game to look up where to find a tresure that I was missing or how to get to a secret area on a map. Although, it is very possible to do so without the internet to help but for some of the secret areas and treasures, there's no way it could be done without looking it up. The trials feel like nightmares the first time you go through them. There's one where it's all portals and if you don't jump through the right one, you're bound to miss some floating angel lights. Same with the plant bombs, they are likely to frustrate you to none other if they get hit with spikes or explode before they hit the yellowish glowing walls. The graphics are beautiful for an indie game. Seriously, everything stands out in it's own way. A dark background with bright enemies or bright background with dark enemies makes it easier to see and defeat them. However, there are some parts where you are in a cave or a very dark area and need to be wearing light rings if you want to get through those dark parts. Unless you want to play the game for the story or are completely new to platformer RPGs, I suggest playing this game on tough or even hardcore mode. I played through on normal and from the beginning, I was wishing I played on a tougher difficulty. There's only one side quest where you are required to kill yourself and there was one other time I happened to die because I wasn't paying attention to my health. However, I had a revival stone that brought me back to life. Twice I died in the 20 hours of game play I put into it on normal difficulty. First time being the side quest, second time was my own fault. If you want to make quests a heck of a lot easier, make sure you have duplicates of items so you can easily sell them to the merchants and buy them after the shops restock. This way, you won't have to grind on enemies to get items for some quests and even for crafting items. The characters in the game are memorable and were fun to interact with. Boss battles were thrilling even if they felt very easy to defeat at times. However, the last boss battle will not disappoint as there are three stages to defeating him and sometimes it felt like my blows were doing little to no damage. It is possible to beat the game with over 100% completion by finding all the treasures, doing all the side quests, and exploring all the maps. From what I was reading about the completion percentage, it seems it is possible to get it to 117% complete. Unfortnately, I was only able to get my game to 114% complete. I believe it was because I didn't get 4 stars in all the trials. Dispite what I said about the trials being a nightmare, it is possible to get 4 stars in all 6 trials. It just takes time and practice to smash all the lights, finish before the time runs out, and defeat any enemies in your way. Even if the timer runs out, you don't fail. You just won't get that time bonus for points at the end of the trail. Be careful though becuase if you get hit during the trial, you do lose points. Overall, this game is fantasic and I do recommend getting this game and playing it all the way through. You will not be disappointed with this game!",

The voice acting in the game was excellent, and the script writing was good with funny parts in the game that proved to be quite hilarious and really made me laugh. The music was composed beautifully and fit the game. With its serene sound I found myself very drawn in and really enjoyed the breathtaking soundtrack.   The animations are perfect as all characters look organic and lively and background environments look rich and vivid. I must give recognition to Dodrill, a self-taught illustrator and animator who both programmed and designed the game and took him over three and a half years to make; a worthy investment. The combat system is excellent with nothing complicated and is very straightforward.  There are some negatives that should be addressed. So far the boss fights are not challenging enough. I was able to defeat the first and second boss in one minute. My last problem with the game is the control scheme on the keyboard. Sometimes you can press the wrong button at the wrong time because some buttons acts as two moves. The result may be different if I used an actual controller. However, these negatives do not hamper the game too much. I highly recommend this game. I give the game 8.5/10.",

The best parts were definitely the exploration and the interaction of Dust and Fidget. I wanted to explore the world. Figure out where the nooks and crannies were. Everytime Fidget and Dust would start talking about something I knew I was in for a treat. For those two reasons alone this game is worth picking up.  The gameplay is good. It isn't necessarily a stand out and it doesn't suck. It's just good. The combo system is pretty easy to pick up, though button mashing is a pretty good way to go half the time. Or just spamming Fidget's attack. One of the two. The flow of Dust's sword swings is what really makes the combat enjoyable. The animation for those is nice, and the speed of the attacks is quick enough to please.  There are some faults to the game though. The character designs are on the bland side of things. The way they're drawn isn't terribly impressive either. Which is sad since the drawings during the final credits are very nice. If more of the drawing in the actual game looked like that it would be more pleasing. The plot of the game is kind of forgettable. It serves it's purpose and manages to pull a heart string or two, it just isn't going to blow any minds. Really the only thing I would say is a huge knock against the game is that Dust runs so freaking slow! I found myself spamming the dodge button so that I could get through screens a little bit faster. I wish they would have sped up his running speed.  Really though this is a fun game and well worth the time and money to play it. I would recommend this to any friend that wants a fun game to pick up and play!",

I knew it was good--I'd heard the hype and a friend had recommended it to me--but I don't think I was expecting to be as drawn into this game as I was. I was really surprised by the quality of the story and voice acting--it's not FANTASTIC but much better than I was expecting, for sure. As noted above sometimes the story can dip into being a little cheesy but usually when it did I found it enjoyable, and there were a lot of twists I didn't see coming, plus some genuinely funny moments (I laughed out loud at the conclusion of a quest involving a missing box) and even a few moments that tugged on my heartstrings a little.  But the real star here is the gameplay. It is a FUN game. The combat can be a little easy but it never stopped feeling satisfying for me, and the system that rewards great combos with bonus EXP motivated me to avoid mindless button mashing. The platforming is VERY satisfying--difficult enough for me to feel engaged but intuitive enough that I rarely felt frustrated by what the game was trying to get me to do. And I really enjoyed the exploration, which is unusual for me. I'm normally not much of a backtracker but I really enjoyed going to previous locations when I got new abilities to find hidden items and secrets.  This game seriously might make it on my list of favorite games, which I was NOT expecting. I'm already itching for another playthrough. Once I get through more of my backlog I'm probably going to replay on hard difficulty to see what it's like and maybe try for 100% completion. I DEFINITELY see this being a game I'll replay sometimes to relive some of my favorite moments or just to enjoy the combat and platforming.",

In terms of the actual game design, it's easily earned a place among indie legends like Cave Story, Iji, and Super Meat Boy, but with art direction, fun factor, and sheer consistent quality that stand out among  all  games. The voice acting is  mostly  believable, with the exception of the titular hero at rare times, the gameplay is exciting and well-balanced, the controls are tight and make Dust enjoyable to play as, and the artistic vision is both fresh and amazingly nice to look at. The only real downside to this wonderful experience is the main character's storyline, which appears to follow in the age-old tradition of making one's OC as angsty and super-special as possible. However, despite that fact the game takes that story and makes it both well-executed and emotional, so it's not that much of a problem unless you're a serious literary critic. And even if you are? I still think this gem is worth it for the gameplay alone.  Quick Pro: Some of the best Metroidvania gameplay in existence. Quick Con: Dust (character)'s story ends up reading very similar to a typical OC's.",

While many say top quality in this game is the artwork, 'I' place top quality on the SOUND of the game. I played the game entirely with headphones, and every little sound was there, from the packing of snow under your feet to wooden floorboards sounding like real floorboards to the enemies and background sounds. So many sounds, but not overwhelming. Couple that with an incredible soundtrack and this game was nearly more fun just to LISTEN to than it was to play.  Of course, you also cannot forget the story. While the dialogue seemed a little broken in areas, it still brought forth a compelling storyline while delivering emotion and detail. EVERY voice actor in this game brough top-notch quality of their abilities, whether or not they just had one line or had the lead roles. Nothing was weak.  Third on my list of awesome things about this game now is the artwork. Yes, it placed third, and yet it was still an epically amazing sight to behold in the game. It felt as though no detail was left out and the style remained consistent throughout.  Controls and Gameplay were very good to me. While I was a bit confused at initially trying to use keyboard (as the game wouldn't recognize my gamepad), it didn't take long to get very good with the controls. Even the defaults were laid out very well. Gameplay was excellent, giving forth a challenge that was fun without being difficult. Even on a moderate (not the hardest) difficulty, I didn't find myself struggling to beat enemies or bosses, however they were still challenging enough to provide amazingly fun battles.  If I had to list something I didn't like about the game, it would be perhaps the anime-style cutscenes felt a little out of place for the style, and that I wish there were more attack-based abilities you could get to make your fights a bit more epic, however neither of these take away from the game at all.   One of the best games I have ever played. Seriously.",

The story isn't amazing, but it is pretty good and had me wanting to keep playing. The art style is very beautiful and hand-drawn. I have always loved when hand-drawn graphics are used in games. I loved the soundtrack and I still listen to it. The voice acting isn't the best, but is better than some games out there. As I mentioned earlier, the gameplay is very smooth, fun, and pretty easy to play. The game is basically a button masher, but there are also a couple combos you can use. It isn't a very hard game, though I'm sure it is difficult on Hard mode (obviously).  The story is a decent length and there are also side quests you can do, aswell as exploring, finding treasures, and finding the 12 characters from other indie games. I got about 15 hours from doing the story, some of the side quests, exploring, and level grinding (you don't really need to level grind in this game, it just helps). I personally hope that Dean Dodrill starts working on another game, and I'm sure it will be just as good as this one. I fully recommend this game to anyone that wants a simple, yet fun game with a decent story. Even after beating the story, I still find myself coming back and playing this game. If I had to give this game a rating, I'd give it a 9/10.",

This game takes themes we are all very famliar with and polishes them up into a fun adventure that is engaging and memorable. The road this game travels is well-trodden, and the developers are very well aware of this which they pay homage to in many homages and references to other popular games. The characters frequently break the fourth wall and I felt that gave the game more endearing qualities than if it took itself too seriously.

However, it went on sale not too long ago and I was looking for a game to play. So I bought it and gave it a try. And I was taken away when playing it. I wish I bought this game sooner and played it sooner.  The story is okay in my opinion, it still urged me to progress to find out more. However, I wouldn't say there is a lot of development on certain things. Being through about 60%+ of the game makes me feel that I still don't know much background of certain characters or objects.  I find the dialogue in this game to be quite enjoyable. There are jokes here and there. Funny moments as well between characters within the game.  The BGMs in this game are fantastic (Intro being my favorite). This really caught my attention and I fell in love with the OST. I wasn't sure what I was really expecting from the BGMs.  The combat is pretty easy to grasp in this game, maybe a bit too easy. It's your typical hack and slash with a bit of a twist to it. The moves do get a bit plain after awhile. Monsters have little to no health. There are a few monsters that you have to 'Parry' for, even then you kill them within 1-2 hits after parrying. So if you are really looking for a challenge, I don't think this is your type of game. Though, I'll let you be the judge of that.  Can't say if there are really puzzles in this game, and if you did count twirling a bomb fruit into a wall a puzzle. Then consider the puzzles in this game to be pretty dam easy.   There are crafting and equipment in this game. However, I was pretty sad how underdeveloped it was. Probably about 20%-30% within the game I couldn't upgrade to anything higher and it was the best item I could make currently. I haven't done all the secrets/treasures or hunted monsters for blue prints to see if there were better equipments to be made. Though I don't see the point if you can kill monsters nearly instantly already. So I thought that was a bummer. Basically you would see yourself spending most of your money on Healing Items or Revival Stones instead of crafting.  Overall I would still give this game a chance probably for the funny moments + story. As for the combat I still enjoy it with the animations, but there isn't many moves you can really do. Hope you find this review helpful.  ",

            "review_text": "I can't remember what made me decide to check out Dust: An Elysian Tail in the first place, but I'm glad I did. It's just the sort of 2D, side-scrolling platformer that I enjoy, and I can't believe this game was more or less made by a single person.   There are so many things I could praise in this game. The in-game graphics are colorful, hand-drawn, and really a joy to look at; the controls and combos are fluid and easy to get the hang of; the story and characters are much more interesting than I would have expected, and the writing it pretty damn good, if a little cliche in places. It's obvious that a lot of love went into creating this game and building this unique fantasy world. Moreover, it's just the right length for a game of this type, but still has plenty of side-quests to keep you busy if you want to keep playing.   All that said, there are one or two things that keep me from giving it a perfect score. For starters, my installed codecs interfered with the game in a way that wasn't immediately noticeable. None of the video cutscenes were playing for me (which also affects certain background elements, like the animated campfire at the map screen), and this didn't become obvious to me until the last third of the game, at which point the subtitles started playing for a video that hadn't appeared. After turning off the DirectVobSub codec (not even sure why that, of all things, was causing the problem) the videos began playing without issue, and I realized that I'd missed a few bits of animation that, while not crucial to the enjoyment of the game, really add to the overall feel of the game. To me, it seems strange that these codecs could affect the game in this way, but I've been out of PC gaming for a long time, so maybe it's not as unusual as I think it is. Still, it's a shame there was nothing to tip me off about it until towards the end of the game.   Other than that, some people might be turned off by the animated cutscenes themselves. They do look like something from Newgrounds, and to be fair, they probably were created in flash. However, while they could be better, they're not too bad all things considered.   One thing I see a lot of people say is that they won't play this game because of the 'furries'. I've never understood this mindset, personally. I understand that there are some (or a lot, even) of people in the furry community whose internet-drama or strange tastes give the community as a whole a bad reputation, but this game has absolutely nothing to do with that. I'm not going to avoid things with anthropomorphic characters just because of a community, otherwise I'd be avoiding things like Sonic the Hedgehog, Kung Fu Panda, Bugs Bunny, and who knows what else. That's just silly.   When I started playing this game, I put it on easy. I hadn't really played games of any sort for a good while, and I thought I'd better start out slow. However, by the time I reached the first real chapter of the game, I was so hooked that I knew I had to restart on the normal setting, since I'm the type of person who won't play through an entire game twice.   ...Normally, that is. I'm already tempted to play through again on a higher difficulty setting!",

            "review_text": "Take the role of Dust, an enigmatic warrior who wakes up in a glade one day with no recollection of who he is. Together with the sage Blade of Ahrah and its cute Nimbat guardian, Fidget, the trio set off to explore the magical land of Falana to try and get back Dust's memories.   Dust: An Elysian Tail has a lot of Metroid and Castlevania in its makeup. You'll be doing things like backtracking, and finding areas that you can't initially access. You'll have bosses to fight and goodies to find- it's that sort of game. Refreshingly old-school in many ways. The action is more akin to a brawler, however. Something like the Shank games, Odin Sphere or Muramasa: The Demon Blade.   Options-wise, the game supports an XBox 360 controller if you wish to play with that, but there are no inherent drawbacks to using the mouse and keyboard over the controller. You can rebind the keys for your convenience if you wish as well. It's like you could barely tell this was originally a console game!  One great plus is that colour-blind mode is present, which will give you a text indicator of what colour the gates in the game are (I don't think this is giving much away, but you will collect different coloured gems to open up corresponding coloured gates). It's not something that is a personal issue, but it is hard to see how this would be a bad thing.   Another great option is HUD scaling. You can alter the size and position of all the HUD's elements- the health bar etc. This can greatly increase gameplay comfort and pleasure.   This is probably the most crucial factor- the game runs smoothly, like warm butter on toast. You have different resolution options, but it ran on my laptop, 4GB RAM, Intel i5 dual core processor, without any slowdown or any performance hindrance that was noticeable. It did not crash once. I can only imagine how well it runs and how great it looks on more powerful machines.   It just seems incredibly well-optimised for computers. It's just excellent, in that respect.   *Ahem* gameplay. Dust's bread and butter is a chain system. You have a few different sword combos you can perform, as well as Fidget being able to shoot magic bolts. The higher the combo chain you can get without breaking it, the more experience you can gain. Get enough, and you'll level up, getting a skill gem to put into a stat you wish to improve (HP, damage etc). You can also parry and counterattack if you have a good sense of timing, in addition to being able to dodge your enemies' strikes. There's also a light economy and crafting system. You can get some equipment to enhance your stats, and you can also collect dropped items and make them into new equipment.   The mouse is incredibly responsive when it comes to attacking, and combat is generally satisfying. You can fairly easily go flying through the air like a whirlwind of destruction! The chain system is something that gives you more reward, more experience, the better you are at it, encouraging you to hone your skills.   Beauty is very much in the eye of the beholder, but the game looks gorgeous, in terms of both art and animation. There's a hand-drawn cartoon style to the characters, all of whom are anthropomorphic animals, making look like the best Don Bluth movie he never made. That's meant with the highest respect. Backgrounds have a nice painted style to them like something out of Rayman, and Dust has some idle animations, again, an old-school throwback. It's a world crafted with a lot of love, with lots of different environments and terrain to go through as well. Colourful, but dark when the environment calls for it.   The story is generally very compelling and well-written, with one or two twists and turns that you may have not seen coming. It's a script that also has a few game references, but doesn't relentlessly shove it in your face that it's trying to reference something. It's rather sensible and grown-up in that respect. The voice acting is generally well done, also. If you have a discerning ear, you can possibly pick out slight differences in audio quality, but it's nothing serious enough to wreck your experience. The soundtrack, by Hyperduck Soundworks, is particularly exceptional, with music that fits the mood of each area well.   Length-wise the game will clock in at approximately 8-10 hours, depending on your pace, but the length can easily double if you pursue all the collectibles and side-quests.   In terms of downsides or nit-picking, the game is arguably on the easy side, but you can remedy this if you play on Hard or Insane difficulties. It depends a bit on how well-seasoned with games you are.   Another limitation for some is that there is only the one weapon that you stick with throughout. You can't unlock or use different weapons, nor can you unlock different combo attacks. You can get, without giving too much away, new abilities, or variations on what you have, but you can't get a bona fide new weapon or any new combos. The upgrade system when you level up is rather linear- you can put points, as it were, into any skills, but you can't go too far into one stat compared to the others. It's strictly making you tougher, stronger and so on. No new attacks or anything special like that.   It's a game that's very much worth your time. You will not regret playing it, I have that much confidence in the title.",

It's ok if you are a button masher, you'll survive here just fine. I however used a ps3 controller the entire game. The 'R2' trigger doesn't work though I used the right analog and that was an acceptable subsitute. Didn't try the keyboard but I couldn't imagine doing it. The settings menu seems to allow for remapping so maybe that's your thing.  The map selection means you can go back and backtrack anything already done, very useful.   Characters are pretty great with some good humor on the side.  Animation feels very handdrawn, or Saturday morning cartoons from the 90s, however exceptionally detailed, colorful, and very fluid.   10/10, played on a Linux SolydX install with no issues. would play again sometime.",

To summarise I would describe it as a fun game to play casually with an ok storyline with a few nice dialogue sequences and a somewhat awkward combat system that takes some getting used too if you have no controller.  The Tutorial for the game fits seamlessly into the gameplay and even adds in some humorous dialogue to go with it showing that the game doesn't take itself too seriously. The way in which you acquire some of the 'special abilities' however is rather tedious and seams rather counter-intuitive, all though some of the dialogue that appears explaining why is rather amusing but only momentarily covers over a flaw in the general gameplay mechanics.  Throughout the game the dialogue between the main character and the companion is well written and makes you feel for the character although there are certain dialogue choices which the game gives you control over which actually doesn't really affect the game at all. I personally found myself becoming more attached to the companion more through the game than that of the main character, which is a shame. It employs that old 'amnesia' affect that so many games employ these days, but with a slight twist to it. Without spoiling it for you your character has some what of a personality complex. The story of the game in general is ok but there are some parts which seem written to fit more around Gameplay than the gameplay matching the story which is slightly disappointing.  The actual gameplay and combat mechanics are fairly straight forward but the Keyboard setup is a little awkward. I imagine it would be a lot better to play this game using a controller. The move left - move right/dodge left - dodge right setup makes it rather fiddly to play on a keyboard. In Normal Mode this isn't a major issue but in Tough/Hardcore Mode you really need to use the dodge more in combat I find, and the mechanics for this are rather unforgiving if you are using a Keyboard/Mouse setup.  The Leveling Up system works for both your character and the weapon/gear you have and it isn't obvious throughout the game if you are of an appropriate level to continue. You can complete the game really quickly and ignore a lot of the side quests in Normal Mode and indeed completely ignore entire areas of the game which don't really add anything to the story, and makes it feel like they were added in just so you had somewhere else to go in order to level up your character so you didn't progress through the game too quickly and make the game harder for yourself by not leveling up fast enough. The actual crafting aspect of the game leaves a lot to be desired. You can find yourself picking up lots of items that by the end of the game you never really needed at all and indeed by the end of the game I had more money than sense essentially meaning by the end I could just buy everything I needed if indeed I even needed it.  I bought this game during a Steam Sale for £3 and for that price I would definitely recommend this game but I wouldn't recommend it at full price though.",
