After you're done enjoying this instalment you can also get Arma 2 and Arma 3.  Some say this is a very complicated game, but so was the original and by that I don't mean the console version (Dragon Rising and Red River) but OF: Cold War Crisis, Red Hammer and Resistance.  For those of you that may not know, Op Flash was the game to go to for your pre Call of Duty, or Battlefield days. that was catering to the (dare I use the term) modern warfare gaming needs, yes you may say Counter-Strike was there before Op Flash but it was focused on counter terrorist tactical combat, not all out war.",
