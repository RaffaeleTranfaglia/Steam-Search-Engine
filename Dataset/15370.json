            "review_text": "This is one of the greatest games that I've ever played.   The campaign mode offers a rich story that follows on from previous HoMM titles and provides quite a challenge on heroic difficulty. The multiplayer mode has incredible replayablity, offering players a choice from a vast selection of heroes, each with various strengths and weaknesses. There's a good selection of maps to play, as well as a lot of user created maps to download. This is certainly a game that's easy to learn but hard to master.   One of the best turn based strategy games out there. Highly recommend.",

I wont compare it to the other Heroes games I have played because they are all different and excellent in their own ways - for people who like the kind of fantasy gameplay they offer. I don't agree with any of the comments that claim that only this or that Heroes game is good. They are all good. If you want to play Heroes 5, then Tribes of the East is the game to buy because it has the final engine and gameplay improvements and you can use a mod (heroes 5.5) to play all the campaigns and maps from the other two Heroes 5 games. Heroes 5.5 also improves gameplay and the random map generator. At the price of €10 this game is fantastic value. Highly recommended.",

Heroes of Might and Magic V was a great game, and this only adds on to it in many ways. Some of the major additions is the two types of each tier of soldiers that you can recruit, and of course adding an additional faction, the Orcs, while not losing many of the great features in Heroes V that were lost in the Hammers of Fate Expansion. Still a very challenging game overall, but well done. Definitely recomend it, especially if you liked the original Heroes V.",
