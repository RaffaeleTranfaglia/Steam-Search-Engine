            "review_text": "Come summer and come sales, can't say I regret picking up this Marshal's tale.  Buying this game at 0.99 euros I feel I should have paid more, because what I got out of it was a great text based choose-your-own-adventure story, where my choices mattered and I became the darndest best Marshal in the whole of Lander County.  For anyone looking for a great text based game where you can make your own choices that will impact the world, this is a good game for you. The wild west is a lawless place, so you'd better strap up and bring some law.  If I knew how good this game was before I bought it on sale I'd have bought it when it wasn't on sale, because the studio that made this certainly deserves the full price of 4.99 euros, if not more.  +Support from me, great game.",

            "review_text": "In Tin Star, you play a US Marshal, presumably occupied with Honor, Law, and Order (there are stats for each category). My primary complaint about the game is that it offers too much individual freedom, to the point of departing from its premise. What kind of Marshal blows up dams, robs wagons and shoots people under no provocation? While many scenarios have diplomatic solutions, violence isn’t only a last resort. In other words, I think the story might have been more convincing if the player had other careers to choose from, as opposed to being made a Marshal by default.  That being said, any fan of RPG’s should welcome Tin Star. It’s constructed like a massive Western D&amp;D campaign and is both one of the longest and most interactive titles by Choice of Games. The challenges it offers are numerous and inventive, avoiding the grindy repetition typical of the RPG genre.  ",

Tin Star is so well accomplished as a whole: engrossing characters, thrilling story and seamless interactivity. It also has a good level of freedom of choice. Persuade, create a deal or just shoot to kill many of the criminals you'll met. There's also turns to improve skills and sides stories between the main story leading to the telling of your legend and showing how you affected other characters at the end which is a cool feature, and there's a song too! (it's only lyrics but man it adds to the feel).   That being said, it is hard to even imagine the effort and hours put into this game. Kudos to the writer! Anyone who appreciates a high quality CYOA should get this gem - even if westerns aren't usually your cup of tea.",

Died to a bear. 11/10 fantastic Western cowboy simulator.    Cons:   -addicting, makes you want more  -does not employ the 'discovery' system - all main characters' names are revealed in the stats menu   Pros:   -very well-written story - dynamic characters and lots of interesting scenes  -extensive stats menu - your stats actually impact the story (and your success/failure) significantly  -employs a checkpoint system - many of the choose-your-own-adventure (CYOA) titles do not; reloading a save will subtract from your Legends rating  -employs the Legends system (as seen in the Heroes Rise trilogy) - all of your choices are summarized at the end and give you a rating based on your performance  -easily one of the strongest titles in the CYOA genre (alongside the Heroes Rise trilogy) - the ending has a long summary of what happens due to your decisions  -lots of romance options  -many, many different decisions to make and events to explore  I love choose-your-own-adventure text-based games, and Steam many quality titles, however, Tin Star is very easily one of the strongest available. I started with the Heroes Rise trilogy and have only found a game of equal calibre when I tried Tin Star. I binged through a few other CYOA titles (Champion of the Gods, A Wise Use of Time, Community College Hero: Trial by Fire, and Diabolical), and all of those pale in comparison to Tin Star. I have been saving Choice of Robots for last, and I will be playing that shortly. If you like Westerners and want to roam the deserts of Nevada, then you must try this game out.  ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND!  Cheers, DJSF  @DJSF's Rogue Reviews    My Website  [theroguereviews.com] ",

Some soundtrack would go in pretty well but maybe it would disrupt the entire idea. I enjoyed every minute in this little masterpiece.  Pros: -&gt; Very Well written. By the end I felt involved with all the characters and too time to read ALL the epilogues because the game made me genuinely care  -&gt; Very Detailed. The descriptions and the narrative is very catching and detailed, making fell like you are in the scene.  -&gt; Worth the Money. I took 10 hours to finish this game and with the nearly infinite possibilities one can easily spend 30 or more hours living as the Marshall of Lander County for just a few bucks.",
