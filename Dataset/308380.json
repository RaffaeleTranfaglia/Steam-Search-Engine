            "review_text": "The game itself is pretty good, I like it but I highly recommend you to try the demo as the demographic of the game is very, very small.  Graphically the game is not impressive at all. The option menu should make Totalbiscuit proud except for the control section, you can only change your mouse sensitivity on it, however there aren't many controls for the game as most of it is done with the mouse. The tutorial is pretty much non existent, there is an instruction section in the main menu but this is like an instruction booklet which you will have to look at if you decide to try the demo / buy the game.  The game itself is a third person version of Xcom, you have a (rather big) squad of people and you try take out the enemy team, in the mean time you have to micromanage their ammunition and movement more than you have in Xcom. You can choose to have more grenades and less ammunition or more ammunition and less grenades, or less weapons etc. the stance the unit is in also changes the accuracy of the unit itself when shooting, so if it's been running it will shoot less accurate and will also be more easy to hit then when it's crouched but it will move faster and further.  I recommend this game because I like it, but try the demo first even if you think this game is something for you it's there for a reason.",

            "review_text": "I've played the game a good amount and count on logging in more and my first impression was rather good! Granted it is far from the best game out there but you can tell it was made 'with love' as they say.   I'll start this off by saying this game could do with some more work, although this might be a little harsh, it simply did not feel like a completed game; the campaign map is overly simple, the soundtrack gets repetitive (and so I decided to turn it off and add my own background through playlists), the information on the campaign map and how everything functions is a little hard to figure out and finally but most of all, the AI seems a little 'simple'. It was not overly hard to defeat, I had to figure out the mechanics more than outwit my opponent.  Now with all that said I still think this is worth picking up. Though a little on the pricy end, the game is fun and slightly nostalgic in it's take but very enjoyable. The tatical combat is nice, the setting is too and the overall idea and execution are very good! I would consider this a potential diamond though very rough indeed and am very interested in what this game could become.  P.S Steve (I think it's your name) Yorkshire, if you could add a comments section to your website I think it might be useful since people who, like me, are fond of this game and would like to see it grow, could maybe give you points we think could be improved. This is entirely up to you but I would be ready to give you everything I thought was good, what needed improvement and my ideas on what could be done! Of course I don't consider myself an expert but hey if you want my help I'd be happy to give it!",
