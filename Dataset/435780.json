            "review_text": "Never thought space could be simulated so in 2D. Controls are tough and the journey even tougher, Frustrating at times, completing missions gives a feeling of satisfaction, even to the point of bragging rights.  The game brings back nostalgia when spoon feeding gamers were never in game design and players were treated intelligently. Not to mention the wonderful art style and soundtracks, The feeling of isolation like Gravity is always looming as I play.  I would love to see a leaderboard if possible.",
