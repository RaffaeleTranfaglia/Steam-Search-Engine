            "review_text": "Having recently purchased East Tower-Kuon in a game bundle, I was finally able to continue the series. Those familiar with the East Tower series will know that East Tower-Kuon is the third game. As it's been a few months since I played East Tower-Takashi (the second game in the series), my memory has gotten a little rusty. But let's see how I do. ;)  Basically, like the first two games in the series, you take on the role of Sakuya. East Tower is an attraction where the participants enter the Dream World through their consciousness, and Sakuya is one of those participants. So this time around, Sakuya is paired up with Kuon, and there are the usual obstacles to pass and all. However, Kuon's route is different from Akio's and Takashi's in that Sakuya finds out that the game keeps repeating itself. I won't spoil as to why this happens although I did find this twist to be interesting and made Kuon's route different from the previous ones. If you especially go on Kuon's love route, there is a teaser at the end and let's just say that it made me quite curious to play East Tower-Kurenai soon. ;)  I suppose my opinion of the game is the same as for the previous two games. I liked the story, as those who know me know that I think story is the most important element in a visual novel. The art was pretty good as well. In regards to the writing, there were grammar errors here and there and perhaps some polishing of them would have been a good idea although I am nitpicking here. These errors can be overlooked, as I thought the story was intriguing.  Overall, I'd say that if you liked the first two games in the East Tower series, then you'll end up liking East Tower-Kuon as well. I'll soon be playing East Tower-Takashi and I'll be posting a review of it as soon as I'm done. XD",

            "review_text": "This review covers all 4 of the East Tower games in one. Simply put, the game isn't very good. The art has occasional good moments but most of it is pretty bad. The story is set up in such a way that it could lend itself to an interesting discussion of gender identity and digital sexuality but it instead chooses to do clich√© 'oops, I tripped and grabbed your boob' moments. There are dialog options but the game is still very linear; you either die instantly, find a solution, or pick a solution that gives you a bit of extra dialog.   I would not recommend any of these games except for Kurenai (which was admittedly pretty good). However, there are parts of the Kurenai story that won't make any sense without playing at least a bit of the other ones.  The game is also way too expensive. I bought them all as a set with 40% off ($18 total) and I feel ripped-off. There are much better VNs available for much less. Takashi, Kuon, and Akio were each only about 1.5 hours of play time, which is not a great value.  Finally, every time you finish a section (and there are at least 7 sections per game) the game tries to get you to post to social media. That really pisses me off. It takes me out of the moment to try to get me to advertise for a game that I paid for. Dear game devs, please don't do that!",
