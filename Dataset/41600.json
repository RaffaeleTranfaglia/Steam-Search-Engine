Good creative setting and characters, awesome music and entertaining gameplay(though the controls are tricky at times). The steam version is missing all music files, so be sure to look the fix for this up before you start playing. It can be found in the community page for the game. A 64-bit era classic.",

            "review_text": "I'm still new to the EWJ fandom, and heard some stuff about this one, but I believe in giving a game in a series I like the benefit of the doubt.   Now, I've cheated a little with a let's play and a review on YouTube, but here's my oppinion after playing a little bit of this: True, the game shares the structure of many games of the N64 era, the camera's a bit of a chore to work with, the music's not there (Possibly due to copyright issues) and the story's a little...Blah...But, for its time, the graphics are dece, gameplay is okay, and the layout/concept is innovative...With a little work. Let's recap.  Pros: Decent graphics for it's time, inventive concept, good controls.  Cons: Piggy-back structure, Camera, No music, Somewhat weak story....Oh, and you need to reconfigure the controls every time you get ready to play.  Fact: Not EVERY video game legend has had a graceful transition to 3D (How a certain BOBCAT who shall not be named managed to survive up to when the 3D era began is beyond me!), but with some work, Jim might have stayed in the big leagues to this day, instead of (Until recently) going dormant after a guest role in Clay Fighter Sculptor's Cut...But, what can you do?  Final thoughts: It's not the best, it's not the worst, if you want it, click those buttons!",

If you plug in an xbox controller, it's a ♥♥♥♥♥ to move the camera and theres no other way to move it other than map two buttons to pan left and right, no up or down. I played this 3 times at intervals of 10 minutes and it frustrated me how much of my nostalgia I was losing, since I remember playing this on the Nintendo 64. This is bundled with the first 2 Earthworm Jim games and only the first one is worth playing while the second isn't. 5 minutes of Earthworm Jim 2 and I couldn't get past the first level because it didn't explain properly how to play it.   I bought this because I loved the N64 game and wanted to play it again but after this....this....If you can put up with the above issues, go nuts otherwise this is a waste of money. It's broken and incomplete. I would sooner recommend Revelations 2012 than this and the sad thing is I'm not joking.",

If you liked mario64 or banjo kazooie this could be right up your ally, it's not as good as those games but its not far behind either. Downvote for the horrible port, as it is a pretty good game.",
