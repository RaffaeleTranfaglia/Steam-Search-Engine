Koru, a boy from the slums of Colortown, must rise and stand against the Bleakness, a dark force intent on wiping out joy. Koru must use color and emotion to restore life to Colortown!",

            "review_text": "The Last Tinker: City of Colors is a 3d action-platformer similar to Banjo-Kazooie and Wind Waker (Zelda) with an unique art style (think DR. Seuss) set in the gorgeous world of Colortown. The color palette consists of reds, blues, greens, purples, oranges, yellows, and whites. The video settings are standard PC options- VSync, Texture Quality, etc. The game runs great on almost all PCs and looks great with any settings option. The Last Tinker runs on the Unity engine, showing us the versatility of the engine and how good games look on it. The engine and graphics are great and are NOT outdated by any stretch of the imagination.  The Last Tinker's story is pretty straightforward and even sometimes 'childlike' in it's presentation which is a downside, dealing with issues like racism, sadness, anger, and fear which is good for kids but doesn't feel the same for adults. But it makes up with funny and cute characters. The dialogue is cringe-worthy and some of the characters are really annoying and cliched to the 'T'. But I absolutely LOVE the world and the lore of this universe. There are three spirits in The Last Tinker, each has a different punch, a different special move, and a different problem to solve. You will find them throughout the story. There is the Red Spirit- Anger, the Green Spirit- Fear, and the Blue Spirit- Sadness. Each spirit is in charge of their own districts. Red Lizards (Red District), Blue Bears (Blue District), and Green Turtle-things (Green District). Which has torn Colortown apart and it's your job, as a Tinker, to bring them back together and to defeat the Bleakness (White).  Sound is top notch, music is phenomenal, and the voice acting is comprised of oohs, awws, chirps, and other noises. I don't like the VA but you can easily turn it off in the options menu and still have SFX and music on. The music is your typical PS2 platforming game OST with some groovy and immersive songs.  Now to the gameplay! Platforming is done by pressing forward 'W' and 'Space' will allow you to automatically jump to a specific platform. Combat is really interesting. So you punch with 'LMB', 'MMB' up, and 'MMB' down and you dodge with 'RMB'. (There are also combos and different moves to unlock; for ex: 'RMB'+ 'LMB') The Red Punch ('LMB') can defeat the enemies in game, the green punch ('MMB' up) can make enemies scared and run into deadly traps, and the blue punch ('MMB' down) can immobilize enemies and are weak from the back. The Red Power is a, for lack of a better word, 'Berserk' mode where your DMG is up and your speed is up. The Green Power lets you freeze time to solve puzzles, platform across fast moving objects, and position yourself in a tough fight. The blue power gives you invincibility against anything including the snow-like bleakness. There are also light puzzles which can be solved with your powers/ punches or with Biggs and Bomber. Biggs and Bomber are mushroom folk that use abilities to solve puzzles and to get collectables. Using different punches shows off their different abilities. There are also amazing boss fights.   Additional Notes:  There are many collectables to get throughout Colortown. While some story levels are bigger, the majority are quite linear. The game is also really easy. And the rail sections of the game are completely annoying and are really blurry so you can't see obstacles up ahead. I finished the game in 10 hrs. and there is a total of 14 Steam achievements.   Final Thoughts:  I recommend this game to anyone looking for an old-school 3d platformer reminiscent of Banjo Kazooie and Sly Cooper. With that being said, the game suffers from childlike dialogue, story, and presentation. But overall it's a wonderful experience that's worth playing through a few times!  *Review copy was provided by Mimimi Productions; Thank you!*",

While playing through The Last Tinker I kept getting memories of Ratchet &amp; Clank and Banjo Kazooie, 2 of my all time favourite games. I'm actually very surprised that this game is an indie game, it is so well executed and the art style is amazing! The music is beautiful, I especially loved the music in the blue district and in the caves. The only downside is the difficulty, I defeated the last boss without losing any health.  All in all, this game is great and I definintely suggest you buy it. 9.5/10",

            "review_text": " Overview : This is one of the best spins on adventure games i've played in a while. It reminded me of ye ol' Jak and Daxter and Ratchet and Clank, where you have just a simplistic complication, but don't let that fool you as there is more to this game then it seems.   Story : Being one of the few members of the town outside the major districts, your little community takes in all kinds of color'ed people and the town acts as a neutral settlement for people afraid of their own districts. Majority of the game revolves around the complications each of the 3 colors present to one another;  Red  most commonly known for anger and rage is well represented through the Red characters.  Green , the curious types of people who turned coward, have more of a technological side with their robust defenses and how they live boarded up in their homes away from all the outsiders.  Blue  was the trading hub of color, which in this world was the biggest product that everyone needed and used. Although due to complications they all turned sad and depressed.  At the very start it may seem slow, but if you pull through the excellent tutorial that is given and move towards the big twist that even I did not see coming, the game draws itself a quite nice narrative.   Gameplay : The combat after you reach the fighting part of the tutorial seems very bland, sort of a button mash really to kill most of the enemies early game. But I digress as the further in the game you play you can purchase upgrades and combo's for your attacks and also increase duration of abilities. This allows for people with different playstyles to work more efficiently and perhaps change the gameplay to suite individual people.  The parkour element, a MAJOR part of the game is very well produced. The smooth maneuvering of jumping around on boxes and planks really feels fluent. It may be hard to understand at first but once you get through the basic of how to jump around without stopping to look around it becomes a fun experience jumping around and exploring to find collectibles.   Controls : A combat/parkour game must have a big majority of the focus on the controls, without doing so it could make the game feel troublesome to control and overall a bad experience. From what I have played of the game using my Xbox 360 controller ( Yes it supports xbox controller which is a big plus for me ) it is very difficult to get used to from the average buttons. The interact button is what would strike most people as the most unusual, as on the 360 controller it is (Y), and you will see why it is as you progress through the game. The combat portion of the controls amongst the parkour is also very fun to play with. It has a dodge mechanic which seems very functional when needing to dodge attacks, and can also be used to initiate combos and reach platforms if performed correctly.   Sumarrising Statement : This game may not be as extensive as the old PS2 games that this game seems inspired off, it does bring a nuance in this genre with its unique parkour concept and the difficult combat found later in the game. I greatly feel this game is well worth the $4 spent and is a must pickup if it goes on sale for lower. 8.5/10",

I've seen some reviews stating that the autojump goes against everything they were trying to recreate, but you can use something as inspiration without copying everything that thing did down to every little detail. The auto jump while not ideal works in this game and thats important to note.   I would say this game set out to recreate the feeling of games of old and in that respect they certainly succeeded.  While I have yet to get anywhere near finishing the game I can say without a doubt this will be a title I enjoy until the end. From a development team I've never heard of this is an amazing job on a great game.",

The 2nd stealth section was pretty grueling at first, but then I realized I was being an idiot and the security system only sees you if you' moving.   That bit aside though, the world is refreshingly unique with fun, bright colors, the level design is great, story is creative, controls are spot on and the difficulty feels just right from start to finish.

            "review_text": "I enjoyed this game and will come back to it to finish. I have made it far enough into the game to feel I would comfortably recommend this game. It's a fairly inexpensive title which I wasn't sure about in the beginning. It feels like a Jack and Daxter as far as the silent protagonist, loud mouthed best friend, colorful levels, and quirky supporting characters. However, it's sort of a platformer with no controlled jump and Arkham Asylum style combat. This makes for more of a beat em up with a few flaws but overall a quirky story, solid combat, and a fun world.  Graphics: They set out to create a specific style and succeeded beautifully. For the overall aesthetic, they nailed it. Everything looks like it's painted and when the world starts going 'bleak', the lack of colors is very apparent. As you take damage, you seem to be drained of color which is a nice effect. The speech bubbles are actually cut out signs on cardboard which are only written on the front of. I do have a problem with the speech bubbles, as fitting as they are. Sometimes, they don't appear until you are right next to a character. They are large enough that I find myself having to move the camera to read them. This could have been corrected by making them pop up a bit further out, but then it wouldn't feel like the characters were talking to you. Overall, it's my only gripe about the graphical presentation.  Music: This soundtrack is amazing. From the stealth areas where the music changes dynamically when guards are getting closer to you to the standard area themes being unique and fitting. The music you get on the farm feels very twangy and laid back while the combat music is more up beat and intense. Every area's music is not only appropriate, but also something I would go out of my way to find and listen to while relaxing at home. It's a stellar example of matching the visual aesthetic to the auditory aesthetic.  Gameplay: The game offers a variety of difficulties without forcing you to unlock them which seems less common these days and I am glad to see it. The difficulties range from Kid, where most attacks are one hit kills, to One Hit Death, where every hit you take kills you and HP means nothing. That being said, all the difficulties seem to be arbitrary increase in damage against you and damage enemies take. There are no AI modifications or spawn rate modifications which I noticed. The AI, in general, is very basic, but this is not a bad thing. Each monster acts it's own way and never react based on other monster's movement. It's a very NES/SNES style of programming AI. The smaller melee guys just rush you. The larger AI guys rush you. The ranged guys stay ranged and never move. The shield guys disappear and reappear waiting for you to stun them. No monster will surprise you by doing something you don't expect. But it works Trying to time your attacks so you hit the small guys, dodge the big guys, ranged attack the ranged guys, it all adds to that chaos that made those earlier games fun. The issue I have is the checkpoint system. It doesn't maintain a state that the game is in, merely a respawn point. What this means is, if you are in a particularly nasty fight, you can run in and kill as many guys as you can until you die, respawn near by, run back in and the only monsters there are the remaining monsters of that wave. Every fight can be done like this, including boss fights as far as I can tell. There are no numbered lives so there is no way to lose the game. As far as the platforming with no jump button, it works. There is a run button. If you are holding it and you reach a ledge with something you can jump to, it will jump. They work in a lot of timing systems into when to progress to the next platform and when to stay back. With ranged enemies covering these platforms, sometimes you find yourself bouncing from one platform to the next and back again while waiting for another platform to come up and trying to not get hit by the ranged guy. The challenge is there if there was an actual reason not to die.  Overall: I really do like this game and would recommend it, if only as an example of a game with a fully fleshed out concept. My issues are generally surface level. It could use a life system or a full respawn of enemies on death. As it stands, maybe playing it on One Hit Death can serve some challenge, but I see it ending up as more of a test in ones patience, really. Ultimately, a fun experience, albeit an easy one.",

            "review_text": "Review:  The Last Tinker: City of Colors has got to be one of the best indie games I have ever played. It isn't the most difficult of games and not necassarily the best of the indie franchise, but it certainly has had some work put into it and it deserves to be recognized. And with that, let's get into this review.  So to kick things off, let's talk about the story. The main character that you play as in The Last Tinker is Koru, who suprisingly enough, is the Last Tinker. Weird right? The place that this all takes place in is Colortown, where three factions of people live together; blue, red, and green. A race is held anually in Colortown and Koru always competes. But the night after the race, things go terribly wrong. A purple color element turns the world into bleak or in other words, white and gray. Now Koru most bring together the factions and their elements to stop the bleak from destroying Colortown. Although I may have left a few things out, I personally though that this story was although very simply and relatively childish, it was still fun and I thought it added to the game very well. Not much else to say about the story. Next, the gameplay.  Ahhh, 3D platformers. Oh how you made my childhood amazing. This game is very reminiscent to me of Spyro: Dragonfly Dojo and Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. The gameplay is sort of an action 3D platformer. You also get new abilities for each element you collect and for each move you buy from the fighting expert. The combat was pretty unique too because once you got further into the game, you were given many options on how to take on your enemies with the power of the elements granted to you. There are also puzzles which you know aren't the most challenging thing, but you know... they're there :P. Now one thing I am sure people will want to know about this game is what are the controls like and should I have a controller? Gladly, the keyboard controls are good and a controller is not necassary. If you are a pleb like me, you don't have a controller for PC games. Althought the controls felt a little bit contradictory near the start of the game, you eventually get a good feel for them. Onto the look of the game!  Honestly, this would probably be the main reason I like this game so much. The visuals are absolutely amazing in terms of variety and color. And that is what made me want to play it that much more, so I can restore color to Colortown so I can see the color again :D. Now of coures the game isn't exactly on my top list of best graphics, but man these visuals just draw you in that much more.   The last thing I would like to issue is how the game is $20 at original price which brings up the question, is it worth $20? Well my personal answer to that question is no, no it is not. Although all of the things I said were good for the most part, this game is not worth $20. My first reason for it not being worth that much is because the game doesn't really have enough playthrough time and if you'd ask me, the game doesn't have much replayability. I consider my self a relatively average platform player and my playthrough was only like 5 to 6 hours. With $20, you could go buy something you can pour many hours into like *cough *cough Rocket League *cough *cough. I got the game on sale, so I would say I got worth out of it. Honestly, my best calculation of worth for gameplay is $2 = 1 hour. The second reason I would say this game is not worth $20 is because of the fact that there is much more time and value you can get out of 20 dollars. Unfortunately, this $20 price tag for a game that was released a little over a year ago for an indie game with a small amount of play time just makes the game not quite worth it. If you can get it on sale, definitely consider getting it because it is most certainly worth it if you can get it like that.    Overall, my experience with this game was fantastic and worth the amount of money I put into it. If you can get this game on sale it is most definitely worth your money and I reccommend it. Please don't actually pay $20 for this game though if you have value in mind.   Overview: Pros: 1. Colorful 2. Fun Gameplay 3. A Simple, Yet Charming Story Cons: 1. Not Worth $20 2.

It claims to hark back to 3D platforming collectathons such as Banjo Kazooie and Jack and Daxter, but collectables are not important at all, and are sparsely hidden as well. Also, there is no jump button, so it's hard to call it a platformer. The majority of the focus appears to be the combat and light puzzle-solving. The pacing is really slow, and the combat is simple. Early on a quest is for a (15?) hit combo, which can be done with a single button. Later on, attacks do get 'color' added and become more complex, even if just by having three varients of the same punch (to be clear though, I only have one color right now, so while I have no reason to believe it will get better, or that other colors will be more varied, I can't for certain tell you that it stays boring.) You can also use the game's currency to buy upgrades, but from what I've seen, it isn't anything exciting, nor anything I found more usefull than to mash the normal punch buttons. Maybe I'd like it better if I knew what I was getting into from the start, but even taking that out, the game isn't engaging to me as most actions are completely automatic, such as platforming 'assassin's creed' style, I guess you could call it.",

I hope you enjoy the game!  Unfortunately for those of us playing on a different gamepad, this game will not work. I tried work-arounds to get it going, with no luck. Looking at the Steam forum for this game, there is a large quantity of other buyers that faced the same predicament, and a number of them just chose to hide the game from their library. I guess this is what I'll do.  The devs apologize, but haven't found a way to accommodate these players, and seem to blame buyers in the forum for not looking at the fine print of the support details. Fair enough.  Aside from the fact that I won't be playing it, the game does seem interesting, and the visuals are very nice. Hopefully if these developers put out another game in the future, they won't make the same large oversight.",
