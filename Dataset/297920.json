            "review_text": "I really like this game. It has been described as The Sims in Space. I have never liked The Sims games as I find that they are far too repetitive and boring. Space Colony is a good building game, The Sims element is that you do have to be aware of the needs of your operatives to improve production. This does give an extra twist to the game that you have to think about and some of the challenges are based around ensuring that your crew are reletively happy or they won't work.   Any Building Sim worth it's salt should have an element of ensuring that you are providing basic things, such as food, so I don't find this particularly strange, as some have mentioned. Making sure your crew does not go mad while on an abandoned planet does give the game an additional challenge.  The object of most of the challenges is to produce as much money or supplies as possible. Each crew member has his/her own specialism so the object of the game is to mangage your crew to get the highest productivity while protecting the base from space monsters.   There does appear to be a few bugs, that I noticed. I have found that if you save your progress regularly, then when you encounter a bug re-load your progress and the bug goes away. The bugs do appear to be based around not recognising your progress. I also had an extractor that wasn't being recognised by the supply depot. These are all really small bugs which don't hinder game enjoyment but may mean loss in some progress if you don't save.   I would put it in the same category as games like Dungeon Keeper or War for the overworld.  Have fun building and watch out for the protoraptors, they are tougher then they look!",

            "review_text": "I think this game has something good going for it. It's like the Sims and theme park. The problem is, its too much like the sims. You have to baby your crew, they forget to eat, sleep, clean, and all the basic human needs, so you have to monitor them heavily. Plus they have relationship requirements. I dont mind taking care of some issues, but it gets overwhelming quick, and they can be stubborn as a mule.   I only have a limited time with the game, I mainly played the sandbox mode. I never had to face the aliens, but if I did, I feel like I would of been in deep, due to the fact I have to juggle the tiniest problems delicately.   I wouldnt recommend this game unless your into macromanagement. Just too much going on and not enough reward for me to have fun.",

            "review_text": "I really wanted to like the game but it falls down on it's execution. It all feels a little messy.  The UI isn't as intuative as you want it to be, you can't rotate things you're putting down, they never quite fit into your biodomes in any sort of a way that makes you feel like you're making a coherent base.  On top of that every character is basically a lazily written stereotype with voice acting that is laughable.  :(",

However before i edit this review after playing more [btw i think i am too old for this game] it feels teenager focused or a mobile game...just writing this review made me remember i had to get vicki into a romance with boris... yeah, and little hearts will pop above their character... ah come to think of it, and just picturing playing hours sending vicki to the disco and then to the social area that I AM OUT. helllllllll no am i going to play this game more than 17 minutes. i am going to delete it - regret purchasing it -- and move on. never thought a review could save me hours...",

Sadly I lent my edition to someone and never got it back, so I now bought the steam version for old times sake.  The game hold up suprisingly well. The graphics overhaul makes it still good enough to look at. The characters are just as fun and quirky as I remember, the missions and maps are complex and diverse. The mix of Sims and strategy game is still rather unique and still as fun as I remembered.  The editor is quite robust as well and easy to use on top so you can handcraft missions for yourself or others.  My only gripe with the game is that the last few missions of the civilian campaign are military in content. If I want to play military I will play that branch. Meh.  But apart from that - great game, well worth getting!",
