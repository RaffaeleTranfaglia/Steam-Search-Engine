            "review_text": " Publisher:   Strange Loop Games  [www.strangeloopgames.com]   Developer:   Indie Pub  [en.wikipedia.org]   Platform:  PC  Controls:  Full Controller Support  Vessel is a fluid based puzzle-platformer in which you play as M. Arkwright, an inventor who created an automaton called a Fluro. They were created to help out with laborious tasks which they can perform better than humans. Only problem is they start evolving and running amok so you need to go through the world of Vessel to fix what they have broken.   To help you out in the game you get a liquid gun with a tank attached to it. You can either spray liquid or suck it into it. It’s also upgradeable with different nozzle tips and larger tanks. With this and the Fluros you will be able to complete the puzzles throughout the world.  You’ll play through three different areas where you will need to repair machinery that the Fluros have broken. The levels consist of a factory, orchard, and mines. Through these levels you will discover new types of Fluro that you can use. You also need to capture each type which will then give you a seed. The seeds can be thrown on the grown and spray with liquid to form whichever Fluro it is. These vary from ones that like to press switches, chase you, collect liquid till they pop, hide from light, or go to the light.   The puzzles in the game are challenging and fun to do. I had a few that really made me think but the fun was in discovering how to get the different Fluros to work for you. The story also wasn’t too bad and did add a little to the game but it was really all about the puzzles. Overall Vessel is a fun challenging puzzle game to play and should not be missed.   Bear Pros:  Great liquid physics Fun challenging puzzles Fluro characteristics     Bear Cons:  Somewhat lackluster ending Only three areas to explore Needs more of these great puzzles (not really a con)",

But now your animated “Fluros” are acting a bit off and you've got to fix them.   While I didn't find the puzzles to be very difficult, I Still enjoyed the game. There is a kind of laid back feel to the game and completing the puzzles still gave a feeling of accomplishment. I've come to expect excellent music from indie games and the soundtrack is pretty good here. Wish a soundtrack came with the Bundle. While the controls are clunky; It only affected a small part of the game. The main character kind of reminded me of a puppet on strings, For some reason.   Nothing too taxing, but a pretty decent game.",

There are a few spots that require quick fingers and fast reflexes, although there are many puzzles where you just need to do the right things in the right order. Most of the puzzles are challenging without being impossible, so it is very satisfying when you solve a puzzle.  I rate this game an 8 instead of a 9 because I ran into some game bugs on the final level (accelerator) that made the level unsolvable. I closed the game and restarted, and then I was able to complete the puzzle first try. I think there a few bugs like this in the game where you need to restart the game to make it work right. Still an excellent game and well worth your money.",

I'm not really into puzzle games, but Vessel does the genre right. The use of physics with liquids to solve was cool, and the Fluros are fun to use. I like the slight upgrade system that was intergrated as I'm an RPGer, so I love to level up and upgrade equipment. The only bad part was it's over too quickly, I would have love to upgrade and buy more weapons and play more stages. All in all, a great indie IP.",

The water physics used in this game uses up a ton of performance. Platforming with such choppy frame rate is pretty irritating.  The puzzles use these water clones a lot and getting them to not kill themselves is just frustrating.  I love sidescrolling platform puzzles and I loooovvvve water physics but this game doesn't nail any of this.  Graphics are also not all that impressive.  Adunno, I'm not feeling it in this game.",

            "review_text": "this is an ok game. It keeps introducing new mechanics and elements throughout the game, but somehow still managed to be somewhat monotonous.   Game is easy until the last section, which is oddly hard. It's difficult to controll the green liquid and get the fluros to go where you want them to in this section. it feels like you lose the control you've been perfecting throughout the rest of the game.   It has a lot of slowdown. My computer isn't the best but it has run more complicated games than this just fine. It just has a lot happening with the liquid dynamics, and background and foreground all moving around. It made the game unplayable at points. I had to keep it at a really low res to play.   To summarize: Just another platform puzzler. Somewhat more unique than most. Not a very interesting story or character, though. A lot of 'upgrades' that don't really do much and feel like fluff. Lots of slowdown on ok computers. somewhat frusting at times because you don't directly control the solutions. Not worth 15$.",

What it doesn't tell you is: 1. The jump mechanic could use some work 2. The equipment upgrades lack detailed descriptions 3. Like all puzzle games there will be times you will be left wondering what needs to be done to solve the puzzle. The last problem stems from the fact that you need to pay close attention to all the visual cues. When you fail to notice key information required to solve the puzzle, the situation is not handled well. A hint system would be beneficial to the game. Recommended for puzzle lovers! &lt;3",

The puzzles range from easy to mind-boggling, though the game is weakest and can get frustrating when it requires precision since the physics aren't precise, though those points are mainly if you want achievements.
