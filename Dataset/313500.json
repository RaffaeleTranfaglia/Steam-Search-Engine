            "review_text": "This is the first generation of Men of War and Company of Heroes 2. I played this many years ago along with the first one, Now the first game has terrible graphics but is still playable. Blitzkrieg 2 is a lot better but you still have to manouvre around the age barrier of the game. Realistic to an extent as bombers actually destroy tanks and not just knock a little bit off the huge red health bar games tend to have these days. You can build trenches, road blocks and other types of obstacles which make the whole concept a lot more appealing. I have the first on disc (still) and just downloading this second anthology now, deffinitely worth the time and specially worth the low cost of money for the amount of gameplay you will get out of this!  8/10  (If you played the older generation of Command and Conquer, then you will absolutely love this!)",

            "review_text": "So I'm just going to get directly into pros and cons...  Pros: 1. Is a classic. 2. Has amazing gameplay, this game actually requires you to think rather than rush in although the rush tactic does work in some cases, however you'll find yourself screwed most of the time. 3. Has a really good unit roster.  4. Unit types are actually quite balanced. This is extremely rare in most games, as usually one unit wins you games, however this game does a great job at making you use a mix of different types of units to get the job done, and does a really good job at giving you multiple different options, and approaches to tackling a situation. 5. Is better than company of heroes. Yes I said it, the graphics might not be, but the gameplay is, by a mile. 6. Is not one sided! While each country has their strengths and weaknesses, there is no one country that has an advantage over another, it's all dependent on how you use them.  Cons: 1. Outdated graphics. Ya, it's an old game, it's graphics are not the best, but if you play games for graphics, I refuse to call you a gamer. 2. A kinda annoying AI. The unit pathfinding, and general AI are a little bit buggy, but that can't be helped, it is quite an old game, you usually only notice this when massing units, or trying to make tanks go through heavy object areas. 3. A kinda dead multiplayer. Yes it's unfortunate, but it's an old game, can't expect any people to still be playing it, and as far as I'm aware it currently doesn't even have a multiplayer server, could be wrong, haven't checked steam MP yet.  Side Notes: 1. I have way more than 4.7 hours in this game, as I still have my disk copy, just recently picked this up on steam, totally worth. 2. Playing the campaign on very hard will make you cut yourself :D 3. The singeplayer is more than worth the 4.99 for the game, lol if only it's multiplayer wasn't so dead.",

Although infantry sucks balls in Bk II, its still a great WWII RTS game.  And you can still play multiplayer on the Nival servers, just launch the other version of the game, Liberation or The Fall of the Reich.",

            "review_text": "Found this game and it is a diamond in the rough. The second i started the tutorials i realised that brute force and overwhelming numbers don't work. You have to use strategy, such as an artillery bombardment before your charge, or hitting the enemy in the rear and making there defences useless. The reinforcements system forces you to think about what the attack will cost you, it affects you in the long run. They feature that cought me off gaurd is the ammo system, your tanks and soldiers RUN OUT of ammo, when this happens you need to have a supply truck resuply them, and they have a limited supply, making ware houses (infinit supplies) something to defend as well as your supply routs to the front lines. Further more unlike some games that just copy paste units, every side (even the NPCS) have thier own unique rooster of units giving them an advantage in thier field. Germans: Tanks Soviets: Rocket artillery Americans: Jack of all trades. The graphics arn't master pieces but they are pretty good for 2005. As the campaigns go on, you steadily start being assigned larger and more important missions, which makes it feel as if you are rising through the ranks from some leutenant commanding a few squads of infantry and a hand full of tanks to a general commanding an army to glory. Over all it is a very realistic RTS, gameplay wise, and it will apeal to those who like a realistic RTS.   PROS:  unique units all around  realistic combat supply lines  entrenchment abilities (mines, trenches, obstacles.)  bridges can be destroyed and take engineering crews to rebuild  units run out of ammo  limited number of reinforcments  well balanced (MOAR TANKS! strategy doesn't work)  Use your own strategy  AI actually does stuff (most of the time[sometimes forgets it can reload artillery])  Strategy required (can't just charge and hope for things to turn out OK)   CONS:  graphics  Soviet Rocket truck spam(3 SRTs&gt; 50 German medium tanks gaurding a town)  Have to micromanage my army. Lost 5 tanks to a Bofors AA gun in plain site, but they just let it shoot them because i didn't tell them to shoot. XD   Rating 9/10 very good RTS but units are as incompetent as chickens",

            "review_text": "Some people say BK 1 is the best. But I think BK 2 is much better than former one. Of course BK 1 is also astonishingly awesome but BK 2 has several attractive features - 1. You can form your own army &amp; advanced tactics in single play missions with finite reinforcements. In BK 1, you could't organize your own as each mission provides certain troops and you can receive certain reinforcements under certain conditions. But in BK2, there aren't much troops in the very beginning of the missions. So you must call reinforcements that you want to prepare for defensive or offensive actions. And I am lovin' it. If you are good at infantry tactics, you can form your army mostly with infantries. If you good at armoured tactics, you can form your army mostly with armours. 2. You can train your troops by experiencing them in BK 1 you can only train certain artilleries and armours but in BK 2, you can train Infantries, armours, artilleries, and even airforces in Group! 'in Group' means, for example, if you done training Elite infantry, Any Elite infantry in your command including reinforcements will be 'trained Elite infantry' and they would have maximum 4 additional abilities which are very useful. 3. Graphics are good 4. Musics also nice",

            "review_text": "This game made me think about many things, but the one that I must put here is how a RTS game could have such amount of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t as in this one? how is a mortar able to launch it grenades at the velocity of a dammed grenade launcher from nowadays? and how is a bloody armored car from 1944 able to reach around 80KM/hr in less than 1 second and stop it as well in less than 1 sec? How is a bloody MG nest able to get destroyed in questions of seconds by an advancing enemy squad? and the biggest doubt of all... HOW IS A TRUCK ABLE TO BLOW UP IN 2 SECONDS AFTER BEING FIRED BY A 5 MEN SQUAD WITH BLOODY MP40s?!!!!  Only on your side there is a strategy, but by the part of the AI, there is no strategy or whatsoever... The AI looks pretty much like a 12 year old kid that just select all the units on the screen and order a full out assault. Plus, you can't do anything to stop it, since your MG nests, even though they are entrenched, are going to be cleared within a *blink* of yours... and AT guns? well, they do have some AP power, but absolutelly no defence... A german rifleman can just aim at it and with his magical 900/rounds per minute Ka98, is going to rekt him, only if the AT gun is paying attention somewhere, because if not, its probable that the poor rifleman is going to face his worst nightmare... A Machinegun enplacement with the ability to fire AP shells.  +Plus, the infantary requires some hacking-like skills to be fully used, I have lost the count of how many times I have seen entire companies being whiped out in questions of seconds by OPS AT guns and mortars... And I bet those entrenched british make those poor germans think they are back at Verdun... Also, don't EVER trust the AI... It is more dumb than... well... the level is so low that I can't even explain it. I GOES OUT OF THE RANKING. I can't think of why the developers would made a tank AI so dumb that it just TURNS ITS BACK ARMOR to the enemy when ordered to go back... Also, it doesn't really looks like the AI has more functions than: 1. Avoiding hitting hard objects (houses per example) 2. Shooting with a shameful precision sometimes and a sniper some other times. 3. Fire and reload faster than Flash on cocaine (giving a new meaning to 'BlitzKrieg')...  If you are looking for realistic gameplay, this is a REALLY fast paced game, so you do better get away from this page right now and never come back. In the other hand, if you are looking for CHALLENGING gameplay, this is the game for you! the game where a Panzer III would get rekt by a british AA gun, and where Light AT guns shot like machineguns...   P.S: After writting this review I guess I just discovered the meaning behind the name 'Blitzkrieg'.  ",
