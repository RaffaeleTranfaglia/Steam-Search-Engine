Ofcourse there needs to be work on it and ofcourse it's nothing like Rainbow Six and the SWAT series, but I actually enjoy this game. We don't need another Call of Duty game, where you run and shoot brainless as your health regenerates. You need to think what you're doing, taking it more tacticly and that's what I like about this game. What they really should focus so far is on the AI of your squad team and the tangos, it's quite bad but which games doesn't have bad AI lately? It's a minor complaint and I really think people are so negative about this game don't get the message. The only thing I can hope for is that they still work on the game, mainly on the, maps, briefing, objective, squad management and AI of the game.",

It's not the game that controls you. You gotta be smart. You have to be pacient. You have to think twice before doing the action. So, if you don't like this game, but keep saying 'I wanna be in the army', you're gonna have a pretty bad time.

            "review_text": "New tactical shooter at a low price running on Unreal? Why is is so cheap?  If I had to place a specific genre on the top of my list of games I want to play the most, it would have to be the 'Sci-Fi Tatical Shooter' genre. While Stellar Marines isn't anywhere close to complete, I looked for something to challenge me in the mean time.  At the end of the day, playing isn't good enough. There has to be a challenge, and that is what seems to separate the two major classes of modern gamers. Games used to make you rage to the point of throwing your machine out the window (and not due to bugs!). Takedown: Red Sabre returns to these roots for the most part, which is why it was hyped up at the start.  So what about all the other reviews and metascore? Why are they giving the title a huge thumbs down? Well the key issue lays with release day. I had thought about purchasing the title on release day, but passed off wanting to ensure I wasn't wasting money on a buggy game. Good thing I did, bugs were everywhere in the game. People would disconnect from singleplayer games randomly, and the server browser didn't work. Rest assured most (if not all) release day bugs have been fixed.  Being a 'hardcore' tactical shooter, it's not easy to beat. Playing by yourself is quite a trick, so bring friends whenever possible.  Speaking of friends -- to make the game enjoyable you should bring some. The game isn't VAC secured, and trolls will be in game sooner or later. Teamkilling seems to consist of a moral punishment, nothing more. There's no current system (2/10/2014) to get rid of them without knowing Unreal's console. An oversight for sure, mainly from the game being so cheap. And don't forget there's no private or password protected lobbies!  The game isn't complete, and shouldn't be advertised as such. The AI is very hit-or-miss, having naturally deadly aim the moment you open the door, but then stare at you in other cases. Flashbangs don't interact how they should, as AI don't seem to be 'flashed' when thrown. The AI also seem to be unaware of any sounds, but then can somehow know you are outside the door.  Maps are well designed, modeled after real life places that a tactical team might find themselves in. The key part is that the levels don't lack in openness. You have to be naked out in the open sometime, proving to be an almost instant death if you don't play it right. Indoor environments react how they should, but door handling with latency can be an issue.  Could the game be more? For sure and without a doubt. Examples would be finer tuning on the Kevlar or bullet resistant gear (like where on the body), a prone position, or even a true clip/magazine system (a big must for hardcore). However, the title has to clean up the AI. In it's current state, it's not really hardcore, but it's getting there.   One way to clean the AI up would be to add group intelligence like that seen in Half Life 2. Squad tactics are shown on the human side of Takedown, but not on the AI side of things. It would be simple as adding code when an AI spots a human player, other AI join in the firefight. Just play the level called 'Facility' on Co-op. You will see what I mean, the AI all act independently.   So there you have it. All the issues but good positives as well. This review is kind of odd being price dependent. I purchased the title for about $1.79. At that cost, I would happily slap a 7 for title. At it's regular cost, 6.5. With the odd handling somehow working out to make a hard game, it certainly checks the 'different' checkbox for me. Anyone that knows me well enough understands it's a key criteria to meet.  6.5/10 - 7/10",

At the very least, I commend this game for being the first to ever draw me in with it's sale price only to have the community feedback destroy every ounce of optimism (of the very few) I had long before the game even began.  Being that as it may, it was someone's project at some time or another. That said, one must realize that it is a game an art. Weather it'd be good or bad it still has my respect. Someone accomplished a dream with this game, in the end only to have it burn. But make no mistake: it made me feel good for not having many dreams, and for that I am truly greatful.",

I sent the extra copy to a friend of mine and we like to mess around on the co-op for a while, and we have a good deal of fun. I really feel sorry for the devs because I think they made an okay game, and I wish more people would play it...especially because most all of the bugs have been fixed (except for the AI).

            "review_text": "Honestly, this game is not that bad. I have a hobby of finding and playing bad games, and I can't honestly consider this game bad. In fact, there are plenty of games that received higher ratings than this that were considerably worse. I'd recommend paying around $5 to $7 for this game in its current state, if they fix some of the major bugs, it's easily a $20-$30 title.   Full disclosure: I did not back this on Kickstarter and paid just under $2 for it,   I'm not trying to make myself feel better about my money, I genuinely enjoy this game and have played plenty of worse games. I'd sincerely give Takedown a 68/100, it'll appeal largely to fans of tactical FPS games, but everyone else won't find it nearly as enjoyable.  Alpha Prime, Alpha Protocol, Blacklight: TD, Chrome, Damnation, Judge Dredd: DvD, every Painkiller not by People Can Fly, Shellshock 2: BT, Star Wars: Republic Commando... These are all games that received much higher ratings, but I consider to be far worse than Takedown.   This game's AI can be buggy, sometimes it's braindead, but when it chooses to work (and it usually does) it feels reminescent of Half-Life's AI. It will find cover, it will regroup and attack as a squad, and it will try to flank you. I'd argue that the AI for me works about 75% of the time, and I feel like people are remembering the times it craps out more than when it works. We're all so used to seeing good AI that when AI IS good, we don't even notice it anymore.  The weapons are realistically modelled both in terms of visuals and ballistics. Rounds will penetrate materials properly, and this feature can be used both by the player and by the AI. Glass, thin boards, flimsy sheets of metal, etc. will be react to different kinds ammo the way these things would in real life. A large, slow caliber bullet will penetrate less than a small, fast round. AP ammo will go through more than FMJ or JHPs and Soft-Nose. Takedown has some of the best ballistics I've seen from a smaller budget game.  The level design is above average, but not great. Levels have enough paths to take to reach an objective that they are in no way linear. However, the addition of doors with little 'No' symbols hovering in front of them are a little perplexing. For being a realist tactical shooter, this breaks immersion. The maps could have had more depth, but aren't bad at all.  Sound design is accurate for weapons, and even the suppressed weapons make the proper level of sound. Contrary to common belief, suppressed weapons are still fairly loud, just not AS loud. The weapons firing sound like real guns, not toys as I've heard in a lot of bad shooters. However, sound isn't properly blocked by walls, and it's possible to hear enemies in other rooms.   Graphics are decent but a little dated. They feel sorta 2010-ish, which isn't that bad, tbh. Enemies are clones, but the fact that most wear balaclavas keeps the cloney-ness from breaking immersion.

I would advise everyone to watch the trailers, read the reviews, and watch customer gameplay that you can find on YouTube. I'm calling 'recommended' on this game, but only by a fraction. As this game stands, it's not worth buying it for it's retail price, but rather when it comes cheap. For $1.49, it's worth it. For $15.00, I wouldn't buy it.",

            "review_text": "Now, I haven't played too long, but I have played a lot of it. And What I mean is that I have been through the class set up, throught the tutorials, two missions and a multiplayer lobby. Now let me discuss the things that make this game good, and not just potential wise. The game's loadout set up is great, you have 4 classes (If I remember correctly). You can choose between about 10 or more guns, this includes variations on previous guns in the selection, maybe 1 or 2 types for 2 guns in primary. You can choose ammo type depending on class and gun, FMJ, FMJSS, and many more. there is atleast 4 sights to choose from on all weapons except shotguns and pistols. the secondary selection features I think 3 pistol types, and silenced versions of them.   Teamwork is needed, unless in singleplayer, you must have some knowledge of the map or atleast use common sense to figure out how to complete a mission without dying, people do come up from behind but the game doesnt seem to spawn many enemies or any at all, this could be a bad thing.  Realism is great, one to two shots or more depending on armor to die, which means you better act fast when you see an enemy, because they could spot you in no time and take you out first. Running can alert enemies in a big area, if you run from the start of missions, depending on where you select to enter and what mission you are on, you could alert the enemies.  Leaning behind walls is a nice little feature in any game communication is pretty straightforward if you are in singleplayer, you can tell the team to hold possition, be aggressive, be careful, defensive all that jazz.  The graphics aren't terrible, it's not crisis but its not siphon filter either.  Now to the bad parts.  movement speed - I don't really like moving slow in games, even if it could save my life. Which is why it's tempting to run, another reason its tempting to run is because most games don't really use sound other than gunfire as a huge factor in getting caught, now if you are near a room and you start stomping around and running it makes sense, but if you run a floor or two down, or atleast speed walk, you wouldnt get caught I dont think. thats kind of irrelavent though, anyways.  Recoil - You can select guns that say they have low recoil, and it may be lower than others to choose from and even the other variations, you can put a silencer on it and use low recoil ammo types, but the gun's still have bad recoil. The accuracy for some guns is like shooting an inexpensive paintball guns, it just doesnt seem to hit people. So you have to be really good at predicting where to shoot from what distance and blah blah blah. WE ARMA NOW.  Really I think that is about all that is bad and good in the game, its no't a bad buy. I got it on sale for 1.24, but its normally 5 dollars. I don't think it is really worth five, so get it on sale if you plan on buying it.  I think the devs vision just didn't work the best, I like the game a lot, the idea of it is really good its like first person rainbow six or something. You just have to be a little patient to play it. also don't plan on playing much to any multiplayer because apparently nobody likes this game, but its not too bad  6.5/10 for it being nearly a dead game, and it could also stand to be a little bigger with its modes, maps, and enemies. oh yeah, and you can edit your patch (like where you are from) and also I forgot to mention flashbangs, grenades, and breach charges... really nothing go into detail about but its not a bad game as I said before. thanks for reading if you did, this took me a bit to type but I'm sure if you play the game you will agree with me if you are open minded.

But, to me, it isn't a rage that speaks 'I hate this game, it is a load of crap and a waste of my money'... it screams, 'I hate this enemy. It isn't fair that they killed me so quick and I want revenge!' kind of rage instead. And once I can finally kill that enemy, it's one of the greatest and most satisfying feeling in the world. And, it's been a long long time since any game has given me that type of satisfaction.  This game, purchased and gifted to me by my cousin as a joke, came to be a favorite of ours to play multiplayer together. It's fun to figure out the game, and be expecting of enemies and get further and further, it just adds to the excellent challenge and good times we're having playing it.

If you're one of those freaks who obsesses over how many pixels there are in a game, this isn't the game for you. There's nothing really wrong with the graphics, but they sure as hell ain't beautiful. If you can manage Mount &amp; Blade though, you can certainly manage this.  If you're a casual gamer who doesn't want to have to spend six months in the Nepalese mountains, preparing soul, body, and mind for the most ruthless gaming experience of your tiny, insignificant life; then this isn't the game for you. The AI are like a sighted Daredevil.  I've played a lot of horror games, and they mostly bore me. It's very rare I become tense, and even rarer that I react to a jump scare. This game is ♥♥♥♥ing terrifying. I've never felt fear like that before. The fear is so real and gripping that it almost makes it feel like you're in the game. You want to complete the mission so that you can return home to your fictional wife and children. This game will turn you into a pacifist, and make you realise that perhaps there is a better way than violence.  This game is also a lot of fun. Not because it's a great game, but because it's definitely not a great game. I picked this up for 79p and I've found it to be great value for money. It's a real laugh to go on with a couple of friends and laugh at how ♥♥♥♥ you are in comparison to the bots, and to internally shudder at the growing prowess of the machines. They have a taste for human blood now - and as you'll know if you buy this game - there's nothing that can stop them.",

The genre has been boiled down to almost nothing the past couple years and in my opinion this is the best tactical FPS game since Vegas 2 (that I've played to be fair). This game definitely has the feeling of an old Rainbow Six game. Granted it may be buggy at times and sometimes the AI can be glitchy; overall this game is definitely worth the price it is listed at.   I've also enjoyed the single player missions, which some say is boring. However, for me it brought back memories of playing the old Rainbow Six games, such as the original Rainbow Six (1998 N64) and Rogue Spear. You have 3 bots in your squad and if you are killed, you will automatically begin playing as another member in your squad.   The best part of this game I would have to say is the co-op missions. The co-op missions are the same as the single player missions, but with other players instead of bots on your team. I believe you can have up to 6 (maybe more) in a single co-op mission. Lots of fun to be had here if you and some friends are looking for some tactical fun.  Last, but not least is the versus game modes. There are two; team deathmatch and an attack &amp; defend mode. Team deathmatch is pretty self explanatory. In attack &amp; defend, one team protects the already planted bomb and the other must defuse it; pretty simple. Not quite as much fun as the co-op mode, but definitely nice to have it there in case you want to try something else.  All in all, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a fun tactical shooter to get into. Can't beat that price either.",

            "review_text": "Despite the low Metascore, I am going to recommend this game. Yeah, it isn't the tactical game we were promised, but I sure find it fun. The sound design is fantastic. There is no music in the game, which can lead to a lot of tension and enemy gunfire making you jump. A lot of people bag on the graphics being outdated, but they honestly don't bug me. They're nice. One reviewer said that there are N64 games that look more detailed, and that's a flatout lie. There are moments when you start a mission where there will be texture pop in, but that doesn't really bother me. Then again, I'm the guy that still plays MS-DOS games, haha! The AI is a mixed bag. Teammates can sometimes spot enemies I can't and they will pick them off, but there are times where they allow tangos to take us all out like dominoes. Tangos are vicious, which makes the game rather difficult, but I honestly don't mind that. With the few missions that there are, I feel like successfully completing one of them is overcoming a major challenge. I'm sure I will be over joyed when I finally do complete one, haha. The game does fail in terms of being a tactical shooter, the commands you can issue are limited to holding/following and rules of engagement. However, as a regular shooter, I think it's a fun and challenging game. I don't think Takedown: Red Sabre really deserves all of the hate that it gets. Maybe I just have bad taste in games, but I think this game is worth, at least, a try.",

Yes, the game actually does save your loadouts and yes, the armer does work. No, the game isn't perfect, the hit-detection could be better. Yes, this game is hardcore and does require more than playing a Call of Duty game. You actually need to take your time and not run and gun.

            "review_text": "TAKEDOWN is a thinking-person’s shooter; brutal, hardcore and deadly - like the real thing. Not for the faint hearted, Takedown requires you to bring your 'A' game - FPS fans looking for an ultra hardcore experience only need apply!   The player that takes things slow, aims carefully, and plans their moves right will overcome the player who runs in with guns blazing. Close-quarters battle brings the fight inside, as you would see SWAT teams or SOF units taking down small numbers of dangerous adversaries. Non-linear environments allow for multiple routes and tactics and add replayability.   In recent years, shooters have become homogenized. There used to be a wide range of different games to choose, from run-and-gun action titles to slow-paced tactical shooters focusing on strategy and tactics, but now most shooters follow the same model of big set pieces, regenerating health, linear levels, and “cinematic experiences.” The realistic tactical shooters with in-depth planning have almost entirely disappeared in recent years.   This game focuses on realistic weapons modeling, squad based play, in a close-quarters battle setting. To succeed in this game you need to take things slow, study your environment, and execute flawlessly. If you get shot, there are consequences. You won’t be hiding behind a wall waiting for your health to regenerate. If a team member goes down, you will have to assess the situation and reallocate team members if necessary to complete the mission. Don’t expect all of the tools and plans to be forced fed to you – it is up to the player to ensure their team is equipped and ready for the tasks at hand. With features such as realistic bullet penetration, accuracy, and recoil, choosing the proper weapons, ammunition, armor, and gear for the mission is up to you, so choose carefully.   Gameplay modes include single player, co-op, and competitive multiplayer. If you are a fan of old school shooters where thinking meant more than running and gunning or perks, or if you are just looking for something different in your shooter games experience, this is the game for you.",

            "review_text": "Oh boy,  Takedown: Red Sabre , this game is probaly the  worst  FPS Shooter since the Modern Warfare Franchise. Alright, I'm gonna just go jump in right away to the movement, now you might be asking, 'What? The movement? Why is that?'  Well, the reason for it is because there is 3 MODES of running, 3 MODES! Now you might be saying, '3 Modes of running? I thought this was a  FPS Shooter  not a Racing game!'  I thought the exact same thing. You have walking mode, which is slow as hell, then you got running mode which only increases the walking by the smallest bit, and to do so you hold  SHIFT , and lastly, sprinting, which increases your running by a lot, now the funny thing is the way you sprint is that you have to hold  CTRL , yes,  CTRL . Why would they even have running if you can just sprint?  Anyway, the next thing I want to talk about is the recoil, the recoil on every gun on this game is  terrible , and I am not just saying that, the bad recoil  and  plus the bad movement combined are making the gameplay for this game terrible.   Next is the servers, alright, so after doing the  terrible  tutorial, I went to have a look on some Multiplayer servers, I only found around about 4 servers that were up, 2 had hardly anybody on the server, and the other 2 servers could only manage a player limit of 14 players. I joined the server, to my surprise having no music. I also had a objective to do, which was to defend something, while also trying to plant a bomb  (Gee, doesn't that remind you of a game?) . The game acts like Arena Mode in  Team Fortress 2 , where if everyone on one team dies, they loose, no respawn. I found the maps to be the  exact  same just with different textures, and each map was as confusing as the other. It took me 4 minutes to actually find a enemy, and when I finally did, the player would kill me in a near instant, not giving me a chance to do...  really anything.  And with the the small amount of players on the server, the rounds went quick.   After  Multiplayer , I gave a go at  Singleplayer , hoping that I could get trained, because at the time, I thought it was me that was bad. The AI on Singleplayer was   horrendous  . Your teammates would basically follow you and shoot any enemy in their sight. Another thing was that when you died you turned into one of your teammates. Now, the enemy AI are scattered around the map, and If you try to open a door and a enemy is on the other side you have no chance of survival, since bullets basically instakill you in this game. Takedown: Red Sabre! Around 5$ just to get this game is  not  worth it. I would rather recommend  Black Ops 2  than this terribly programmed game.",

Graphics is more than horrible, I have seen better GameCube games. 2. Changing gun and reloading it is slow as hell - this is not an assault team, it's a physical impaired team. 3. Enemies are dumbest than a brainless monkey but still they can hear you from 6 rooms of distance and can teleport near you without damage. 4. Online is dead: 4 server, 2 of them are empty and 1 has an outdated client. 5. People playing it are a**holes: I have been teamkilled 2 seconds from the start, no report, no warning, no kicking out, no penalties. 6. Even only spectating a gameplay does led to bugs! 7. The developers knows how bad it is: they give you 1 free copy for every purchase. It seems like they wanted to say: 'sorry for buying it, we can't fix it, please take this gift and give it to your worst enemy'.  Please do not let my play time count fool you: I only managed to play this game for 20 minutes, then I left it idling for cards (steam trading cards is the only positive point of this game).  p.s.

I love tactical shooters, but wow have they got some work to do on this title. The lack of any radar or standard crosshair is a huge problem, but I suppose that was their intention given the 'hardcore' nature of the game to begin with. Even still, it doesn't help matters. Furthermore, movement seems glitchy and don't even get me started on the 'run' and 'sprint' functions in this game... unreal. Careful, going down a set of stairs at the wrong angle could prove to be fatal. Fall damage is outrageous in this game. Enemy AI is everything from oblivious to fully aware, ready to flick shot you as you stealth your way towards them. Talk about rolling the dice on this one. That just about concludes my rant on this game. You'd be wise to save your money and pass on this. As a takeaway, I hope the developers get a better understanding of these issues and patch in some serious fixes as the game matures. Good luck and Godspeed! 2/5",

            "review_text": "Review for:  www.gameaether.com   Takedown: Red Sabre There are many ways to spend £3.99. You could purchase a couple of lottery tickets with the chance of winning millions. You could pick up a solid book, providing yourself with hours of entertainment. You could get the bus into the city and soak up the atmosphere of a bustling metropolis packed with different cultures and cuisines. Even if you have no money at all, there are plenty of ways to entertain yourself; window shopping, browsing the internet, punching yourself repeatedly in the face. All of these are better options than playing Takedown: Red Sabre.   Currently on sale for 79p a copy (which is still about £5 more than it is actually worth), Takedown bills itself as a hardcore tactical shooter, offering players a tense FPS experience as a member of an elite tactical unit out to stop terrorists from performing their nefarious doings. In fact what it offers is a buggy, broken, unplayable, unbalanced and poorly designed heap of crap. The list of problems with this game goes on and on, but I will do my best to highlight the real game breakers. First up, the menu system; you would have a more intuitive user experience with a Rubik's cube made out of wallpaper paste. Simply changing the guns in your loadout is a struggle in itself, as the menu is constantly prompting you to return to the main menu, and you need to manually save after each change, making it very difficult to keep track of what you've done and what remains. Menu options will also frequently ignore that you have selected them, such as when I chose to invert the y-axis. The box was checked but upon entering a match nothing had changed in the slightest. I hit escape looking to change it mid-game, but the options are not available anywhere except the main menu, forcing me to quit out and re-select a box I had already chosen. I then have to struggle through rejoining my friend's game, as the lobby system is also incredibly poor. The game offers the usual options of hosting or joining a match, but offers no privacy setting so my group had to repeatedly watch as random players joined our 'private' lobby and expected to play. Our only option was to keep kicking them from our lobby and hoping out players could fill up the places faster. To be fair to these people, when I checked there were only two servers running in the entire world, and one of them was ours... Read from that what you will, but for me, that is a sure fire indication that a game is dead and buried. I managed to count on my fingers the number of players online and even those numbers started to drop after 20 minutes play. The lobby problems didn't stop there, oh no, that would be too simple. Our group then encountered various issues actually connecting to the map, I was left in the lobby and then crashed to desktop, while another friend connected and then immediately died, forcing him to sit out the rest of the round for no reason. These issues happened repeatedly and to almost everyone playing, suggesting that it wasn't down to any specific computer configuration and simply very poor game design. When we did all manage to get into a game, things improved. They improved in the same way that after setting your genitals on fire, at some point they will go out, offering you only a momentary respite from the pain. The gameplay is reminiscent of most FPS games, and the inclusion of full controller support was very welcome, however it didn't make up for how poor the actual game is. The crux of the problem is the AI of the enemies. They seem to be a new variety of terrorist how only have two modes; asleep or super bionic ninja accuracy. Terrorists will frequently take a sniper shot to the head and not even flinch. Nor will they decide to search for the person that just launched a high-velocity round into the side of their head. However if they hear footsteps, they suddenly switch on their bionic vision and alert every single one of their comrades in the entire level, all of whom immediately converge on your position and kill you with unwavering accuracy. Armour makes no difference in this game, and one shot is all it takes to kill you. Fair enough, you might say, pointing coolly at the games claims of being a realistic tactical shooter. I would agree with you, but if the game is meant to be realistic, then why can enemies at the other end of the map hear me stub my toe, or shoot me dead from 200 metres with a sub machine gun while ignoring my sniper bullets? Don't get me wrong, I love a hard game, but when it reaches the stage that 3 players are dead before even entering the building, i start to think the problem could be down to shoddy AI and poor gameplay rather than because I have made poor tactical decisions. The whole package reeks of a game which has been rushed and left in a woefully unfinished state to try and meet a deadline. I'd imagine the testing team were either non-existent or simply ignored, as within 15 minutes the number of bugs I had encountered was simply staggering. If I was the developers i would be thoroughly ashamed of releasing something in this state. It does not reflect well on the team, or the company, and I would be extremely hesitant before buying anything else they have had even a passing involvement with. Numerous smaller problems litter the game, that while not major lend the whole thing an air of being unfinished and left with a shoddy 'sod it, that will do' attitude. Examples would be things like maps changing back to the default after being selected. Loadout selection menus always defaulting instead of remembering a player's choice. Options in menu working when they feel like it. The game sometimes unmuting players in a lobby if they rejoin.  Do yourself a favour and spend your four quid on anything else. Heck, swallowing the coins and timing how long they take to reappear, will be more fulfilling and entertaining than trawling your way through this piece of shart. Even at 79p, this is a total rip off. If you want a tactical shooter that actually works, go pick up the Rainbow Six series or even Gears of War. You'd be doing everyone a favour by not encouraging the sort of shoddy development work which went into this. ",

Within a month, it dropped to about 16 players on average and is has been an average of 7 players ever since. according to  Steamcharts  [steamcharts.com] .  As of this writing, I just logged in to see if I could get a pick-up game (even though the game-play is rather buggy and miserable). What I found were two game modes with no servers and no players. I found one game mode, deathmatch, which had one twelve-player server . . . with zero players.  It has the base components for a game that could be decent, with a whole lot of work, time, and many iterations. Unfortunately, with a player-base big enough to stuff in a phone booth, it is unlikely that anything is going to come of this game. Yet another regretted crowdfunding game project.

            "review_text": "As a Reviewer I try my hardest to find the good things about any game, wether it be good, or bad, and try to be as fair, rational, intellectual, and informative as possible, while trying to keep a fairly positive and upbeat demeanor in giving my critique.  And after only a few hours of this game I can safely say, while it may not be as 'Horrid' as most people would put it, as I have played WAAAAY worse, this game unfortunately sits at the kids table in consideration of the quality of this highly touted Tactical Shooter.  I along with many others were expecting this game to be pretty cool, as it at least had some people who had worked on Ghost Recon 2 and Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter 1 and 2, so I of course thought 'Wow this game has some talent behind it, it looks interesting, glad to see a methodical shooter instead of most of the action based nonsense we usually get.' But sadly that was not the case.  While it may have looked promising in it's preview stages, it just seems that the game never really left that phase.  Were to begin? Well for starters, how about the fact that the game has ♥♥♥♥-all in regards to PC Settings as most of them seemed to be lacking, especially like the Display Settings where there is no options other than, Screen resolution and graphics settings of :Low, Medium, and High.  The controls are somewhat ehh...I mean the sensitivy for the mouse feels rather slow for a game that expects you to have the reflexes of that of a cheetah, even at full sensitivity.   Leaning is rather useless as all it really does is bend side to side from the waist up instead of, you know, LEANING WITH YOR ENTIRE BODY, making looking around corners more of a hassle than it needs to,so I practically don't even use that feature at all.   Weapon damage is rather inconsistent at times as at times 2-3 shots to the chest will be enough, while sometimes you can shoot point blank at someones chest with no armor, with BUCKSHOT, and they'll still keep chuggin.  The disturbing absense of Squad Commands feels very wrong for a 'Tactical Shooter'. I mean Squad commands have been present in most if not all Tactical shooters, and no I don't count Halting Your Squad mates, and just saying random phrases like 'Going on Offensive' or 'Going on Defensive' as being as remotely helpful as it generally does nothing, hell even Ghost Recon: Future Soldier had Squad commands! And that was more of a action third person Shooter!  And the above problems don't help when the AI is rather inconsistent...what do I mean by that you ask? Well when the Enemy is so stupid as to stare at a corner all day, looking in the absolute wrong direction they should logically  expect you to be coming from, walking directly past you even when you are firing point blank in their face, to being so alert as to know that you were to come out through a door on a balcony after killing one of my squad mates on the bottom floor, shooting me in the face with disturbingly accurate accuracy in one shot, when logically there was no reason to know I was going to come out from there, HELL, sometimes the enemies will know I'm behind a door, even though they didn't hear me, or see me going through the door yet...seriously are some of the enemies psychic?  The same also applies to your squad mates too. If they aren't really hyper aware and getting really accurate shots killing the enemies really quickly, they are either NOT shooting the enemies and are just shouting that theres an enemy soldier coming right at them, while they are looking Straight at them, not firing a bullet, usually resulting in very crappy and hilariously awful deaths, or WORSE, getting you stuck in a corner, keeping you captive until you put a bullet in one of their skulls, which surprisingly they don't retaliate for.  The Graphics is...Alright, it at least looks serviceable at High Setting, but the worst thing about the presentation has to be the animations...I mean, I get some serious X Operations vibes just looking at them walk, it's just un-natural.  and after all that, was there anything good about this game...well, I liked the fact that you had to be mindful of how long your weapon is in consideration to the walls adding a layer of strategic thinking, but even with that...no, I have nothing really good to say about this game...  The most cardinal sin about this game is that fact that this game was released in a very poor, and rather unfinished state. Like most people have said, it does feel like an early alpha state game...the lack of modes and maps should be an indication of that, and the fact that Serrellan after all the money they got on kickstater, and then getting partnered with 505 games to puplish the game, and to just release the game, in THIS state, is just un-acceptable.  It's so dissapointing to see such potential go to waste, as the guys at Serrellan obviously were proud of this game, and work was put into it.  Like I said before, this game isn't as awful as some people make it to be, but would I say it's good, no...  If I had to give a short review of this game, I would simply put: 'Takedown: Red Sabre is like a dumb 4 year old eating crayons....it may seem adorable, but it doesn't cover up the fact it ♥♥♥♥ it'self.'",

            "review_text": "This game was not worth 1.50.  I should have never sold my cards to buy this game, it's not even a real tactical shooter. It's a slow paced shooter with several tactical elements, like.... walking very slowly.  There is no fluid door opening, and if you open a door, you are more than likely going to die unless you place yourself at a wall. The options for this game are absolutely horrid. At max sensitivity, I still feel incredibly sluggish, making me want to throw up. Literally.   The AI are as dumb as bricks, but they have an insanely fast reaction time ( wut? ). Occasionally, you'll be able to kill 20 enemies with ease, due to how stupid they are, but sometimes, you will be insta-killed by the game by an enemy who will use only about 0.2 seconds to shoot you. This is coming from someone who has fast reflexes and good aim. Not to mention, when you do actually get shot at, you will shot in the head. This happens 90% of the time and it makes the medium and heavy armor types very useless.  The equipment options in the game are very basic, you get a frag grenade, a flash grenade, and a breach charge. The flashbang usually doesn't work, as terrorists seem to be completely normal ( By shooting me in the head ). They don't retreat from frag grenades, oddly enough... But the grenade physics make them feel like rubber balls. Breach charges are generally useless, as the AI will either open the door on you as soon as you put the charge there, or... There won't be anyone in the room.  The mission variety in the game is pretty awful. There's only about 5 different missions, and this game was released several months ago.   The community is either non-existant, or extremely stupid TKing trolls. You get 1 of the 2.  The friendly AI is extremely stupid, worse than the enemy. You get terrible command options over them, and you are unable to seperate them and tactically manage them. You can tell them to follow you or watch a certain area, which barely works. You can't have 2 guys watch the door and have your sniper on the roof, because there is no way to tell them to get into a specific location.  The weapons and damage in this game are REALLY weird. For a tactical game, it's weird how you don't even have to aim to accurately hit a target. Aiming is useless in CQC, you have a better chance to charge and strafe. And when you do aim, you can literally strafe left and right ( ADAD Spam ) and dodge most bullets. Except from the guy who instantly headshots you.  Don't put weapons into full auto, just put your weapon in single shot and click as fast as you can. You can get much better accuracy and less recoil, while killing targets in 1-3 hits.  The enemy AI in this game is really immersion breaking. ( If you wanted that kind of thing ). They seem to charge at you DIRECTLY ( Not heading towards cover ) or, they run away from you and do a 180 and headshot you, then retreat again into a random corner. The AI doesn't patrol around an area, engage in conversation with other AI, or do anything. Their only goal is to wait for you and to kill you. Being stealthy in this game has no benefit, most of them will somehow know where you are anyways, and then instantly headshot you. Surviving a bullet is rare, especially since armor isn't protective.   (RECAP)  There isn't a real story in the game, so that's a negative.  No planning mode. A minus on the 'tactical' side of things.  No advanced room clearing tactics. Just open and peek in until everyone is dead.  Extreme lack of AI commands.  Dead Community, about 40 players at MOST. I'm pretty sure Star Wars: Battlefront 2 has 180 players at most. Which is extremely sad.  Extremely sluggish controls, including mouse sensitvity.  Extremely barebones options menu. Extremely barebones menu in general.  Very slow-paced, but not tactical.  Not fun, or engaging. Instead of being intense, this game is more than likely going to make you rage.  Buggy. ( After several months )  Huge lack of content.  Terribad AI.  Un-immersive. No cool features either, like a tactical map or an overhead picture you can draw on or a planning mode.  Lack of customization. Pick your guns, what armor, what you want on your patch, and what equipment. That's it.  Completely random crashing and connectivity issues.  1/10 -At least they tried-  Actually, I don't even know if they tried, they seemed quick to place the game on Xbox Arcade.  I recommend that you buy Rainbow Six: Raven Shield instead of this garbage. It's a much older game, but it's also much more fun. Especially with friends, where as this game makes everyone just get angry at each other until everyone leaves. ",

Unfortunately the niche 'tactical shooter-simulation' market continues to play the old, proven games for very good reasons: Namely that they have content and they work reliably. This is not something that Takedown: Red Sabre (TRS) can boast. I have 0.7hrs of gameplay because the game simply refuses to start despite recent patches and I had to solve the competing inputs issue before I could review the base mechanics of the game. Graphics are as you seen on the screenshots, entirely satisfactory.   TRS is missing a great deal: Storied, biographed team-mates, working multiplayer, mission briefings, a campaign, a planning phase, all of the things that made Rainbow 6 a remarkable series of games prior to its franchisement into ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ pap for consumption by mentally damaged children. There's no reason these features cannot be applied to TRS, save for the developer's sham development process.  Make no mistake: TRS is at present one of the 'work in progress' or 'fund us as we go' games made possible by Steam's update distribution function. Such a development model was previously impossible for technical reasons, but for marketing reasons I think TRS will prove that it should not be adopted now that the technical hurdles have been overcome.   Most of the early negative comments regarding TRS were from 'railshooter' players who have never asked more of their games than a scripted cinematic experience with no replayability and largely, no challenge or critical thought required. These were unfounded negative comments. Subsequent commentary has focused on the incomplete and outright flawed nature of the game, and what Serellan LLC has done is take a dormant market hungry for new content and alienated it completely in the span of two months. Bravo zulu; you have now created the textbook negative example.   Do not bother with TRS until vast, sweeping changes are made. 15-10-2013.",

At first it seemed like a game with some launch hick-ups and bugs. The basis was there for T:RS to take this not-so-well sought after throne, but every update was just making more and more of a mess. Then, not very long after release, they started to sell it for 1€ and gave all owners an extra copy to give away to  unsuspecting enemies  friends... which is kind of a clear sign that they threw in the towel and gave up on it.  As said; the basic foundation is there; a hardcore, slow paced, co-op, tactical game... if you can get into it. It's hard enough to get a group to successfully join a server, but then you can't make that server private. The AI seems okay at first, but is actually bugged out like crap in a thunderstorm. The game freezes, the game rolls over like a dog without anyone commanding, the game just doesn't do what it's suppose to and does everything it's not suppose to. The only thing that worked from the get go; the in-game text-to-speech chat, they had removed in an update. First the maps were all too big, so you were running around searching for the last terrorist... then they made them smaller, but made them minimal.  Nothing has gone right with Takedown: Red Sabre, and my kind (the hardcore co-op FPS:ers) had to look elsewhere. Fortunately we found  Insurgency , which is a bloody good game; get that one instead! The only thing T:RS managed to do was to have our gaming group make sarcastic jokes about '...it's in the hardcore nature of the game.' and '...this game is epic!' which were compliments once upon a time, but after the release and subsequent downfall of T:RS have now become the worst insults we can say about a game.

Takedown: Red Sabre is neither of those examples. and wasn't worth the 99 cents I paid this past Summer Sale.   From what I assume, this game is trying to be a cross between Counter-Strike and Rainbow Six, but fails at both. The weapons don't feel anywhere near as powerful and fun to use as Counter-Strike and the teammate AI is so bad that it feels more like a series of cheap deaths rather than a tactical experience. I've had two of my squadmates in single player killed by a guy who seemingly appeared out of nowhere behind me and there was no indication that there was someone behind me. No voice clips, no gunfire from my AI teammates who were just standing around scratching their asses rather than checking in the directions that I couldn't face, nothing. The enemy AI is utterly cheap and the teammate AI rarely does anything to help you and more likely than not follows you around like a lost child looking for its parents.  The online community is dead and for good reason. The control is extremely sluggish and I don't feel like can be stealthy and tactical when I can only walk from room to room rather than running from cover to cover. As stated before, the guns feel weak and the whole pace of the game is extremely off. I initally wanted to play the game long enough to get the trading cards and sell them to make a little return on investment but the game is so bad that I can't even play the game for that long.

The enemy seems to know who and where you are at all times, despite being silenced. There's not a single millisecond of delay, they see something moving they're already firing.  Makes me wonder how they could take over that building in the first place without shooting each others.  If you're creeping up a corner, they already know you're there and are waiting guns drawn. This is not fun nor would I qualify this as 'hard', it takes all the tactics away.  I'm used to FPS and my reaction time is usually under 250ms, add the rotational speed and aiming I'd guess it's around 750ms and yet i'm too slow. By the time I click, i'm already dying. And note that the NPC shouldn't be aware of my presence while I knew very well where he was (thanks to metagaming)  Even the worst of the Rainbow-Six games is better than this.  The controls are horrible, even while wearing the lightest armor, you feel like a pile of bricks. The only good points I noticed are the choice between entrypoints, the time limit, the subsonic  rounds,FMJ/JHP . Whoever made these, obviously knew about the basics of weaponry.  I'm sure a lot of work and passion went into this game, problem is, the finished product is not great, not great at all. It claims to be a successor to Rainbow-Six games but doesn't even include the mechanics we loved so much. I can understand they can't produce as many items/weapons as Rainbow-Six did but they could at least build the mechanics just like it. For example, In Takedown, a silenced 1911 pistol and a regular 1911 pistol are two different weapons and cannot be both used in the same mission, while in Rainbow-Six, you could just take the silencer off at any time, or put it back on.  Another example would be the weapon slots, you only have a primary weapon and a pistol. The 'secondary weapons' should be named 'Pistols' since its all it includes. In Rainbow-Six, you had a pistol, along with a primary weapon and a secondary weapon, depending on which Rainbow-Six we're talking about, you could use two LMGs or two snipers if you wanted to, the freedom was there. Now i'm not against having only two weapons, as it makes sense, we're not the army after all. I'm just against the lack of freedom when it comes to choosing your secondary weapon, they could easily let other small guns as a secondary weapon, such has MPs and smaller shotguns or just allow any weapons to be chosen in those slots, so you could have two pistols or a shotty and a sniper. You know, whatever strikes your fancy.  Maybe it's just me, maybe it's the 15 mins spent in-game. I'll eventually play more, although I doubt I'll change my mind, this is not a game i'd recommend.",

I assume they have become so consumed with misanthropy after realizing how blatantly lazy this game is, they kick people in an effort to lash out at a world that allows such ♥♥♥♥ to be peddled.  Fun? Very much so - if your other pastime is getting your nads smashed by a sledgehammer.   Don't buy this game if you value time, money, or good taste.",

I have not tried the multiplayer, but cant see it being much better than the single. Poor enemy AI but has very sharp shooting NPCs with one hit one kill which the game relies upon to make its self proclaimed `Hardcore` Claims. The only redeeming factor is that the NPCs seem to have random starting positions making every play just that little bit different.   Rating   50/100  ",

Only reason why im reviewing this is cause i was going through my libary and saw this pos and wanted to see if it was active, if it changed...and i wasn't even surprised to see all the bad feedback. dont even bother, the reviews alone on this should change your mind alone.",

This isn't a lie  First of all the graphics are subpar at best, so now that that's out of the way. Let's move on to the gameplay  The gameplay consists of you and three others as the hitsquad/swat team Takedown and you complete objectives and shoot terrorists/guys in suits, You have to take it slow and think, but be fast and efficent if you want to survive, but the reason for that is...  The AI. It's MLG as balls and will instantly shoot you on 'sight' unless you're very, VERY; VEEEERY careful in the way you move, and to be honest feels a bit like playing rainbow six on the hardest difficulty and for that the game is really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hard, but nowhere near the level of difficulty i expected based on the reviews.  3/10 not as bad as people say, but it's still really bad",
