    "description": "The Beginner's Guide is a narrative video game from Davey Wreden, the creator of The Stanley Parable. It lasts about an hour and a half and has no traditional mechanics, no goals or objectives. Instead, it tells the story of a person struggling to deal with something they do not understand.",

It's like a breath of fresh air to not only hear about these taboo subjects, but visualize them, feel the depth and breadth of them, and actually understand the yearning in it.   If you are going through a hard time, play this game. If you think no one understands you, play this game. If you need help with your own issues, play this game. Or if you simply want to be moved by another's story, play this game. It is eminently relatable to any and all. Unless you are an abiotic robot, ofc. :p  It's a very powerful experience. And it even offers a solution. Get it! Cheaper than therapy, lol.",

Now you may ask why I compare this game to Stanley, and while you may be right, since they are different in a respectful aspects, similarities are impossible overlook. And they are not bad. I thoroughly enjoyed Stanley Parable and I instantly 'marked' it as incredible, unique, and a very memorable experience. Maybe my mistake was expecting more of a same with a bit of variety from this one, but unfortunately for me I was wrong.  Now, I'm not saying this game is bad because it's not Stanley, but I can't help but notice that the game tries to tell a story in a unique, but rather hollow way. I have to admit, certain moments left me speechless, and the story is quite intriguing, but it's not anything special. Why others people give this game such a high praise is beyond me, but I feel like the game has different impact which differentiate from a person to person. When it comes to me, story didn't pull me as much as I thought it would, but that's okay, and I'm more or less satisfied with what I got for the amount I paid.   This is not a bash on a game, given that I left a positive review, but merely a NOTE to NOT expect Stanley Parable 2. Just get into this game, and let it tell you its story. Hopefully you'll like it more than I did.  ",

I am going to continue talking about the game, but highly recommend you just dive in without reading too much into it.  This game is a set of games made by a single developer, none of which were released. A narrator walks you through small projects, and attempts to explain the creation of them. This is how the story unfolds, by changing emotions portrayed through the atmosphere of the various games you play.  The narration through this is really quite incredible. In fact, everything ties itself together very well into a cohesive story, even though you are in drastically different games throughout your playthrough.    Perhaps a little too well, even. But, I'm going to continue telling myself that it's a true story, regardless.    There is also a very good representation of timelines, as the games improve in quality over time. Overall, everything was just really well done, and very well polished.  I can't remember how much I paid for this game, perhaps I paid full price, perhaps it was through some bundle somewhere. Regardless, it was definitely worth it.",

Effectively utilising a 'House of Leaves' like layered narrative in a way I've not previously come across in a game, The Beginner's Guide examines the need for social validation at its extremes, here in the context of the games developer and the player. Throughout it feels like a deeply personal work from its creator (whoever that may be!), and at times you almost feel like you're actually trespassing on someone else's personal space (just as the narrator is doing to Coda). Like Davey Wredon's previous 'The Stanley Parable', The Beginner's Guide pushes the boundaries of what a game can be in adopting storytelling techniques not commonly seen in games. It's probably not for everyone, but at this point if it does sound even remotely like your thing - then it probably is, and I can't recommend it enough.",

I won't say any more as I worry I would tarnish the experience, but I invite you to try the game based on nothing but want. If you want a game that MIGHT leave you with something new (maybe a thought, an experience, a new perspective), I would make the leap. Don't worry about price (as I see that being the main reason I didn't buy this on launch), just go for it if you have the money to spend.

Not that I had any expectation from The Stanley Parable (seeing as I only played it for 15 minutes on my account, but I played a lot when my brother got it.)   And it's not that I was upset that it wasn't what I expected. It was a really good game.  And what I really want to know is,  What was I feeling? What was it because I felt everything, there was happy and sad and everything else. I found myself tearing up and I didn't even know why.  It was sad but it was beautiful. (Doctor Who Quote)  And is this a true story? Did this really happen? Was this an actual person, was Coda a real person? There was one person who unfortunately left a negaive review, but they brought up a good point, with deep analysis, this could all be a fabricated piece of work And that isn't bad, because it is still a great piece.  And someone else left a negative review(Thats fine they are allowed to have an opinion, and this is all mine), saying they think the game was meant more for an audience of game devs 'I imagine this will be well received among game devs, which may well be the extent of the intended audience.'  Idk but I enjoyed it.  Overall: A piece of art, true story or not (and if i could get an answer on that) An amazing story Definately recommended if you like feels and deeperish thinking Great experience Worth the time (1.5 hrs) I don't even know what to say or how to explain it  Update: From someone else's words I can explain it 'Not to be missed'",

Ideas came to him through a monitor on his desk, telling him what buttons to push, how long to push them, and in what order. This is what Coda did every day of every month and every year, and although others might have considered it soul-rending, Coda relished every moment that the ideas came in, as though he had been made exactly for this job.  And Coda was happy.  And then one day, something very peculiar happened. Something that would forever change Coda. Something he would never quite forget.     Aside from the fitting Stanley Parable joke, this game really does speak for any artist who struggle with depression as well as the negative impacts of game developement (or rather just anything artistic in general) it can have on one's life. I recommend you getting this if you want to want observe the nature of how one struggles through it all. Otherwise I wouldn't because it's basicallly another freaking walking simulator.

The game is narrated by Davey Wreden, the creator, and he does an absolute wonderful job of his role, the script he's reading is great and the emotion in his voice comes across as genuine.

Just make sure you finish it because the game and the emotion behind it changes dramatically towards the end, and only upon finishing it can you understand what it is really trying to convey. ",

So I sat down and played this in one go and, well.. what can I say? I really recommend this game to everyone actually. It leaves you thinking about how you treat other people, but also yourself, and how you should handle harsh times in life. I think this game is about the combination between inspriation and motivation to create, and so I really related to it. At one point this game really crept deep inside of me and I felt sick because of what you were suppoused to do. And I think that's a success.  I expected a bit more from it though, I thought it was more of a game with actual characters more than a commentary -- but it was still great.",

At first it seemed a little strange, but it quickly grasped my interest and I was sucked in and couldnt stop playing it. When I play a game, I look for how I get attached to a character in it. Bioshock Infinite got me attached to Elizabeth, as a protector. An amazing way to do that considering the end of the game...no spoilers here :). This game does a similar thing. It brings emotion into what you are doing, in a meaning way that you enjoy. This game is by far, my favorite game of all time now. It is so good, so deep, so driven. I am unsure on exactly how to explain it. Its like a movie, and a story, mashed into a game. The way the game is done is just incredible, like a letter to a friend. Just play it, its worth it, completely and utterly worth it. Just open the door...and find the light at the end....",

I highly recommend it, and anyone reading this and still wondering if they should play it or not should stop reading immediately and come back only when they finish the game themselves.  The Beginner's Guide is an emotional journey of analysis and progressive introspection, through a surreal landscape showcasing the power and beauty of the Source engine. The gameplay is simple; the immersion is real. All you have to do is follow the instructions of the narrator, guiding you though a story, packed with ideas not commonly seen in a video game.  One of the things it might inspire you to do, as it did me, is to create something. Play around with the Source engine. Make ideas come to life.

We follow the story of the narrator, which aims to understand the psyche of his friend, and motivate him in continuing developing video games. Every creation in this game being that of his friend, there is, in my mind, no point in criticizing the gameplay part.  In fact, the developer was able to make all these quite irrelevant parts relevant to each other, and from this point of view, it is a well done job.  But what blew my mind was the last level when the narrator went about crazy to tell his friend how he is sorry, very emotional sequence. Really.  The Source engine has a pretty output, so that the graphics are not bad at all, and the sound design is really good.  The game is well balanced, and the narrator voice is never far away, so that you always know what is going on.  It is a very special game, but I like this kind of short but emotional experiences. If you are not open to this kind of game, I obviously do not recommend that you buy it, but hey, it's only one and a half hour of your time, so you can give it a try.",

The Beginner's Guide is as well crafted as games like GTA 5 but its the price for the experience that is one of the main problems with it.

Our creator, Davey, takes a look back at games created by what he calls Coda, and by taking a look back at them he understands what they truly mean to him, and how trying to help Coda, began to destroy Coda's voice and ultimately silence it. If you are a creative and/or internally struggling person I strongly recommend this game.  I will just say this one more thing. If you are creating out of expression and not impression, you cannot be driven by other's opinions, you can only hope that they understand you.

While TSP is an actual game with a cohesive narrative, The Beginner's Guide is more of what you could compare to a commentary about a particular game dev's life.  That being said, let's start. I went into The Beginner's Guide completely blind; the only thing I knew about it was that it is made by Davey Wreden, the person behind the EverythingUnlimited studios and the wonderful The Stanley Parable, and that it was about video game development. I bought the game without thinking because TSP holds a very dear place in my heart because of how it shows that video games have tremendous potential as an artform and I was sure that TBG would be similar. I was wrong, but not entirely. As I've said, TBG is basically a commentary made by Davey about a game developper, nicknamed Coda (I say nicknamed because I have reasons to think it is not his real name, I won't give any arguments in order not to spoil anything, but think that Coda sounds a bit like coder). You will play through Coda's games and Davey will be commenting throughout by voiceover.  'Well that's great and all', I can hear you say, 'but why not simply have us play the games outside of the compilation? Furthermore, why do we pay EverythingUnlimited the money that we would owe Coda?'. Well, Coda has never released his games to the public. And that's why the story told by Davey is so interesting. I don't know if you are very familiar with litterature or even art in general, but there are many artists who create pieces and never show them to the public. They keep it to themselves. Why then? What is the purpose of their creation? This is one of the questions asked here in The Beginner's Guide. Throughout TBG, Davey tries his best to explain Coda's games, how they show his personnality and how he was feeling at the time and confronts us with perhaps a vision not everyone will have had about video games. The goal of TBG is not only to have us play Coda's games, it's also to make us understand that a creator always leaves a trace of himself in his creations. In the end, The Beginner's Guide is the tale of a human journey, the one of a creator whose only way of expressing his thougts was through his games and his sorrow when he lost inspiration.   I would love to go on about the game, but I would risk spoiling it for you. It's really something to experience. You may still be asking yourself if you should get this game or not. Well, in my very own opinion I think the price is a bit too much to ask for as a game. But look past the game aspect and you will have yourself something special that may change the way you see video games.  It also depends on what you expect from a game. You may have liked The Stanley Parable and not find any interest in The Beginner's Guide, as they have two very different approaches to making you think about its main topic, TSP being more metaphoric as opposed to The Beginner's Guide being direct. You could compare TSP to a philosophic tale and TBG to a philosophy essay. If you want something thougt-provoking and you're not afraid of sitting down for an hour and a half listening to someone talking while not doing much, this game is definitely for you.  tl;dr version: You like thinking, consider video games as a possible artform and wish to support the dev with your money? Get it! You want an 'actual' game like The Stanley Parable that can be enjoyable without thinking too much? Forget it!",

The game opens with Davey Wreden introducing himself as the writer of The Stanley Parable, a work he proudly calls 'absurd'. This game, he says, will be different. Delivering on that promise, The Beginner's Guide asks you not to make a series of choices, but to try and understand where a person was coming from as he created a series of video games. Wreden lets you play these games, frequently interjecting to give you his opinion on what everything means, but what really matters is what you take from the experience.   Traditional gameplay elements are sparse and accusations of being a 'waking simulator' will probably appear in droves, but that shouldn't impede players interested in the process of making and understanding games. The Beginner's Guide is one of the most unique experiences of 2015, staying with you long after you exit the game.        ",

Your best bet at enjoying the game is to go at it blind, I know it's a lot to ask, especialy coming from some guy on the internet but please just do it.  So, this game is of a rare fue. And not only for it's interesting storing telling mechanics but also for how intimate it gets, which in the world of games and game related media is almost unheard of. It seems as if Davey, the creator of The Stanley Parable, is jotting all his emotions onto paper then coding it into a game which is honestly very brave especialy in with the current attitude of 'i'm behind a computer screen and so thus I can behave and talk how I want'. This generaly creates a lot of negative criticism even from people that haven't even played the game.  Honestly what this game does well is that it created an emotional connection between the player and the narrator which ,as previously stated, is almost unheard of. Where most games strive to achieve immersion or simply to just be fun this games goal seems to be a emotional vent for the creator and whether you hate it or love it there is no getting away from the fact that it conveys this very well.   Personaly I think that the emotional connection comes from seeing these games from the narrator's perspective, not in the traditional sense but more that you are seeing what he saw when he first played these games Coda made. I won't spoil anything (although I told you to play the game first) but it is obvious to see that what people think or feel are not always seen in the things they create however the game is very good at trying to push the idea that it is, again. No spoilers.  It is interesting to have the narrator walk you through the games and explane them as he saw them and to give his personal interpretations of them although it feels as if he intends for you to make your own as he hasn't got all the answers himself. which brings me to the end of this review and the final point I would like to make.   I think the narrator wants to know what you think. it's wierd to think of it that way but that's what I truely believe. As much as this game seems to be a personal vent for his emotion it also looks as he is looking for some form of guidance to help him understand his friend. Although by the end we see his final opinion on why Coda stopped making games, I think he wants some outside influence and this is one of the only ways he can do it. where you have Youtubers that convey there emotions/opinions via videos, he does it through games and it creates a connection that could otherwise not be achived.  When all is said and done The Beginners Guide is not as much of a game as it is a Vlog on a much more impressive scale. It is amazing how well the creator shows you what he thinks and feels through incredible game design and story telling and for that I applaud him. Good Job!  If you have read through this and not played the game yet then I would recommend that you get it now. For £7 it is one of the most engaging games I have played for a long time not only for it's possible hidden meanings but for it's personal tone that is carried through out the experience. I can not recommend this enough for anyone who is a creator of any kind as it shows what your work means for other people because it is likely that it means more than you think.  Personal discussion bit  Side Note Update: So it's been a day since I played this game and i'm still getting over it! It's amazing how much it makes you think and I have thought about this game extensively. another thing I have found is that I honestly don't know if it is a real story or not... Think about it for a sec though if you were in Davey's shoes would you release a game about your troubled experiance with a friend and then charge people for the honour of playing your game? This is just another reason why this game is an incredible work of art aswell as an amazing conversation piece.

Davey's perception of 'who Coda is'.  Unfortunately we never get to meet the real Coda.

With that said, both probably have some mental issues ranging from 'slight', to 'better keep an eye out for that one'. (As for who is which... even that can be debated both ways.)  I will say this though... people who are, even slightly, 'creative', whether for fun or profit (maybe both) will be able to relate to the topics discussed in this project.

As you play through each small game that Coda created, the games show similar themes and puzzles throughout. One of the biggest theme is the theme of being trapped. If you have never felt like Coda in the past, or even Davey, you may not get a lot of insight into this game and it may seem dull and uninteresting to you. For those of us, however, who have felt depression, anxiety, and the constant feelings of being trapped and needing validation... this paints a picture which we can truly understand.

I had been lied to the entire game about who Coda was and the part that ♥♥♥♥ed me up worse is how Davey knew this the entire time and still lied to us. He didnt just lie to us by talking about how Coda had been sucked into depression but one of the things that i liked the most about it, the lamp posts, Davey had edited things into Codas games to prove his point and it just shocked me how a person i had put all my trust into and relied on to tell me the truth had manipulated with me.

First, I want to make it clear that this isn't a 'game', it's a 'walking simulator', a 'interactive story' perhaps..with varying degrees of interactivity. It's an 'experience', but it is not in any sense of the word, a game. There is no GAME to it. But this should be expected from the creators previous work, Stanley Parable, which is similarly not a game. If this bothers you, then I'd suggest not purchasing it.  Another thing that may or may not irritate people is the length, I finished the experience in about an hour and a half, I say this not because I am in anyway dissatisfied with the product but because I know people who would be..and ultimately that's what reviews should be about, is it not? helping consumers make informed decisions about their purchase so that can be confident and happy with their purchases.  As for the story itself, it's hard to really say much about it without spoiling it for you...this is a story for content creators, it's a story for game developers, writers, musicians, filmmakers. Anyone can enjoy...hah, 'enjoy', right...I'll get to that in just a bit..Anyone can appreciate it, but as a writer myself the story did hit me pretty hard.  Which, that said. I wouldn't reccomend this...experience...to people who think video games or movies are something to have a good time with. If you stick to games that are only fun for funs sake..avoid this, please, because I assure you it is not for you. This isn't fun or enjoyable in the traditional sense.  It's..relateable, on many levels. Saying it's 'deep' or 'touching' would just sound pretentious and would do the story a disservice but it did speak to me on a very real level.  This certainly isn't for everybody, but if it is for you, if you even think it might be, I do hope as many people as possible give it a chance.",

For a start this is not a game as many people have already stated I can only describe it as an interactive movie/experience. To that end it is not one to be dipped in/out of over a couple of sessions, free up 1 ½-2 hrs and immerse yourself in it. If you allow it, this will suck you in and leave you somewhere trawling your own head and make you commit the very tragic act this showpiece has been describing; which is probably why myself and other people are struggling to articulate its meaning and in-turn feel a little bit lost. A good movie or book is very much down to the individual as to what he/she gets out of it. A good game is different and subscribes to your ‘game theory’ competitive nature which is almost universal. This creation subscribes to the former and is like a piece of art, and like all art will be a masterpiece to some and utter tripe to another. I thought it was great, others will not. ",

The trailer looked nice, and it peaked my curiosity. The game itself was so much more different than what I expected. It's not like any game I've played before because... well, because it tells a story through a series of video games, that seem to have some meaning behind it. Granted, the meanings of these games in this game can be difficult to understand; why did this person make it like this? What was going on in their head? And most of the time it felt empty, there was no objective to these games most of the time, but the way it was made, made these games enjoyable. They introduce a different element than what you see in games today.  I was reading the other reviews of this game, and stumbled upon some that don't recommend this game. Some said that it was just a game about someone that needs therapy. Although this seems true from what you play in the game, I don't think that's a reason why you shouldn't buy the game and play it. Personally, if you like story-rich games, this is still a good one, even if it is someone that's talking about their problems, and their mistakes. Sometimes, if you don't have anyone to talk to, why not find another method of getting stuff off your chest?  The game moves slow, and in the beginning it's pleasant. As the games go on, they get much darker, as the narrator will explain this all to you and tell you his interpretation of why the game maker made it that way. Of course, there's no telling if his representation is the right one, but it is one to make you think. As I was playing this game, I wondered who was this person that made these games, what was he really like? You don't get an answer, but you have to come up with one yourself. Or, you can go with what the narrator thinks of all of it.  I think you should buy this game if you enjoy hearing a story that... might make you cry. Overall, this game makes it enjoyable in its own way, each game in this game has a different atmosphere, and you get to see what Coda might've been like.",

Wrenden's storytelling style is still present here, and it won't feel entirely unfamiliar, but if you come into this expecting the same level of dark humor and branching pathways, you may come out of it disappointed.  The Beginner's Guide is, I guess, what can be described as a more 'standard' example of the 'Walking Simulator' genre, and if you have strong opinions on the genre one way or the other, you should already know what you're getting here. This is akin to a guided tour through a museum exhibit, and if that sort of thing turns you off, you're not likely to find much enjoyment here.  That said, if that is the sort of thing you're open to, The Beginner's Guide is incredibly well presented and paced, and (in my opinion) incredibly effective as a piece of art. To say too much about it would be to rob it of some of its value, but it is the kind of thing that, if you're affected by this sort of thing, will likely sit with you long after you've reached the end.  Davey's narration and commentary, I think, is what really makes this game work. The conversational tone of the commentary gives enough of a casual feeling that it comes off as him trying to have a conversation with you as the player, and I think that honestly makes all the difference here. His cutting at just the right points adds enough of a personal humanizing touch to the experience to what could otherwise easily have wound up feeling a little too weird, stuffy, or pretentious.  The game is short - you can easily do everything in one sitting in about an hour or so, and the replayability is entirely up to whether or not you're the kind of person who sees any value in re-experiencing something a second time with added context. You're not going to find any alternate endings here, but this might be the kind of game worth playing twice for certain people. But even with that in mind, this is several hours worth of playtime at best, so if that's the sort of thing you like to take into account while looking at the price tag, it's worth mentioning.  As for me, I absolutely got my money's worth out of this, and I'd love to see more like this from Wrenden in the future. I'd definitely rank it on the higher end of the genre. I'd recommend it to anyone who finds the the premise even a little interesting... but they should also understand what it is they're getting going into it.  The Beginner's Guide isn't for everybody.

If you're more interested in going against the narrator...it's not the game for you. If you need to believe the box you're placed in to begin with, this is not the game for you either. This is a walking sim and a highly personal story, given a frame mechanic about being about some unknown game developer named Coda. To me, the conceit is pointedly thin. The narrator edits games constantly, and if you know games, you know that you don't...really edit other people's games. This game is about the narrator, and his understanding of himself and his needs. Coda, and his games, ultimately, don't matter. And, yes, people who make games do make games like this...pointless little exercises in understanding, so the games Coda makes aren't the realm of a game someone who makes games to make them happy would make, but that doesn't matter. This game is definitely a game about feelings, that takes you to a very unexpected place. It's a very...emotional ride, and at least for me, I didn't see where it was taking me. I knew from moment one that the narrator was to be questioned. Is Coda a real person? What's the narrator's real relationship with Coda? There's a lot of room for interpretation, but one thing can be certain. There is something wholey and unmistakingly wrong through the who game, and it's the questions that raises, not the gameplay or the conceit itself that are needed. You don't have to play The Stanley Parable to play this, and honestly, I wonder if having played that game may take away a bit of the impact of this game as you're already at questions with the narrator and its hallways to begin with. But, this is a, wholy, beautiful game. Play it alone, when you have an hour to kill, and a little time to reflect.",

However that's not all what the 'game' is, it's a commentary on game developement, critical feedback, interaction between developer and audience and interpersonal relations. The story is fairly heavy and emotional particularly towards the end, unlike the lighthearted Stanley Parable humor here is rare and the game comes with a much more serious and depressed tone.  Recommended for those that aren't bothered by being lead around the enviroment. And those that like to listen and think about what they see and hear. This isn't a game for casual lighthearted fun.

It's a game about validation, and it will resonate with the creator inside all of us. When we find a cool video, we share it with our friends and loved ones, hoping it will gain some wanted reaction. When we make a thing, we want to share it with the world. It's such a lovingly made game. It connected with me on an intensely human level. I know this review is very vague, and I'm sorry for that, but I won't go into detail on any of it.

Its an interactive visual and audio narrative, on the struggles of two men with the perspective of one. This is a very... unique piece of work to say the least. Of course there are people who won't like this: nothing in this world satisfies everyone. But I dare say that anyone who denies the very concept of this game and are unable to comprehend and understand the entire meaning of this, well, I must say they are very shallow, narrow-minded, unappreciative and very well do not consider themselves to be as human as human beings are supposed to be.  What then, are they? They believe themselves to be higher, better, more righteous, morals upheld, perfect.  Ask yourself, ask your inner self, what are you looking for? How do other people do it? Have they overcome it, or failed? Are the people who care about you affected? What are you becoming?  What is this it, that's for you to discover.   This game probably goes against the original creator's wishes, we may find that to be uncalled for and invasive on Davey's part, but you see we do not know the outcome. If we keep looking at the past, how can we see the future? It changes, but its there. The consequences will unravel itself when the time comes. We merely want to do what we believe is right at the present, whether its really the right or wrong thing to do.  Play this, it provides... a very vulnerable and personal insight of a human's insecurities, imperfection, and the mere fact that sometimes we just want to do something for a friend. But, ask yourself again, is it really for your friend? Or for yourself?   TL;DR - Buy this game.

If I had to describe it, it could summarized as a chronicling of a real life, ruined friendship between two video game developers. The game is played running through one developer's various interactive levels made in 2009 to 2011, but narrated by the other developer in 2015 as he used to...uhh...experience them?  I have to say this is really emotional. Like weirdly personal stuff. A deeply intimate tour of depression, antisocial tendencies, self-loathing for one man, and the feelings of abandonment and horrible guilt for the other. I guess I'm recommend it lol but it probably isn't for everyone. Purely from a value standpoint, it's not bad asking for $10 for about 90 minutes of 'gameplay' that you would otherwise never encounter in a video game, ever. Very unique. It's definitely asks the player to remain open minded about the medium itself and to explore an otherwise aimless game for the opportunity to dive deeply into two person's behaviors and thoughts for the sake of experiencing something.",

It may not have the replayability of Stanley (but i havent tried yet, just doesnt seem to be any choices to make that would cause the story to change) but it tells an incredibly touching and deep story that many of us can relate to. This game really gives you a glimpse into the artistic process of game development and how they can be used to express ones emotions or feeling. As you play you can almost feel the life experiences that Coda was going through. At times it can really hit home when you see the discusions that take place inside these games that were ment for nobody but him.

To be honest, I wasn't loving the game for the first half hour or so. It was interesting because it felt like listening to a professor critique someone's art in video game form. But it also felt like I was listening to some forum user rant about how they love some amateur artist's art and how that person is the greatest artist ever.   However, when the level with the fake written messages was shown, my mind was changed. I could relate to almost every message written, and the commentary during this level nearly brought me to tears. I've struggled with loneliness and social anxiety for the majority of my life, and making games is the only way I've been able to cope with it. Seeing that other people feel this way too and use games to cope with it was very comforting. From this point on, the game seemed much more focused and personal.  If you enjoy games that grab you and have a strong emotional impact, buy this game. I felt as if something had shifted in my mind after I played this...like I had made a decision to overcome my anxiety and not let it control me like it may have for Coda. I want to make games and let the world see my art, and I don't want my axiety to stop me from doing that.   Please keep making games, Davey. They are like water in a desert to me.",

            "review_text": "I often get the sense that people visit game review sites to obtain a sense of validation, or maybe to glean some sort of elements of interpretation from an external party – something out of which their own opinion might be formed. Find a reviewer that agrees with your own perception, and you'll feel validated. Find one who doesn't and you have a spectrum of reactions to choose from – from acceptance to angry retaliation. Insert any number of “GameSpot sucks!” or “IGN gives perfect tens to everything!”-related comments here...  Validation seems to be the core conceit of Davey Wreden's The Beginner's Guide, his follow-up to the critically acclaimed metanarrative experience of a few years back – The Stanley Parable. It also touches on other personal themes, such as depression or acceptance, but it felt less cohesive than its predecessor to me. To understand that, the structure of it all needs to be observed.  The Beginner's Guide is presented to us as a curated and scrubbed-off compilation Wreden has made of a friend's one-off game development projects. Davey grounds himself in reality as both the narrator and curator of the experience, and even provides us with a Gmail address, in case the need to discuss our thoughts or interpretations does arise. As for said friend, whom he only refers to as “Coda”, this particular presence is less a character than a set of tics and emergent themes. The game functions both as a, well, game of sorts, but also as a kind of sped-up game development seminar. What starts as a simple and fairly slapdash Counter-Strike map ends as a sprawling train station, the level of detail and effort picking up as one goes along.  Through it all, Wreden seems hell-bent on finding some sort of deeper meaning behind Coda's mechanical or aesthetic fixations and even goes so far as to bypass entire sections of these semi-finished experiences, as impatient as he seems to be to whisk the visitor along to his interpretation of Coda's works. Bridges are made, movement constraints are removed, nonsensical level sections are bypassed – it's presented as Wreden bringing clarity and immediacy to Coda's deliberately obtuse game design fixations, but it takes a back seat whenever the first one feels the need to praise or pontificate on the second's approach to deliberate hurdles or puzzle-solving. It all feels almost... useless, honestly, seeing as I simply cannot see what any developer would gain out of using gratuitous constraints. It isn't even research, past a certain point – it strikes me as Coda, serving as the requisite Socially Inept and Withdrawn Game Developer, choosing to aggrandize mechanics that have no rhyme or reason, no true purpose.  At one point, Wreden whisks us through a few prison-themed levels. You're trapped in a minuscule skybox which doubles as a room, and the walls that are plastered with cloud textures lead out to an upside-down well. The shape and general theming of the prison change, but that's essentially it: you're trapped.  I understand that video games offer a terriffic medium for self-expression, and several developers have not only written the proverbial book on the subject, they've improved it. Dear Esther, Gone Home, Neverending Nightmares, Among the Sleep – there's a bevvy of titles out there that eschew the need to provide traditional mechanics. ♥♥♥♥ First-Person Shooter concerns, we've been getting Barthesian Analysis Simulators!  I don't mean that in a mocking way – I'm glad for any attempt to use hardware and software in a means that injects a dose of literacy or much-needed depth into the medium. What does chafe against me, though, is the notion that someone like Coda would feel the need to use deliberately obtuse mechanics in the context of a series of games that was never meant to leave his hard drive! Oh, everyone can do whatever it is they feel like on their own machines, of course, but why create Byzantine environments if you're going to restrict yourself to a tiny room? It's difficult to put into words, but there's a point in the game where my empathy towards Coda dwindled to nothing. I no longer saw someone trying to verbalize their social anxiety or depression (as claimed by Wreden) through game mechanics, I saw intentional denial of external solutions and, well, general intellectual masturbation. Coda's minigames stopped striking me as being about the struggles of someone with a neuroatypical framework to fit in with a world where interaction is more valuable than metaphors expressed in a game engine; and started coming across as navel-gazing.  “I am troubled,” the game says. “I have issues. My inner thoughts are turning dark and disturbing. I need help but cannot bring myself to get it. I can't stop making games, yet the process is killing me.”  Earnestness bleeds away, and soon all I heard was “I am today's Tortured Poet, suffering through the Source Engine as Poe, Baudelaire and Nerval once did through the written word. Watch me play my sorrowful violin of recycled mechanics being presented as being meaningful! Hear me, fellow sufferers of anxiety!”  At the same time, The Beginner's Guide wants to feel like some guy poking around with the modern-day toy which is every open-source game engine ever. It wants to feel disjointed and it also wants to feel meaningful. I perceived a dichotomy in there, and it left me with a feeling of aggravation. I thought the game would end in a specific manner, which I won't spoil, and it only threw one serious curveball at me. The epilogue's change in focus reframes the entire experience and again, Wreden wants us to feel some sort of epiphany, to come out of the experience with the abovementioned thoughts on personal validation. Is it alright if someone creates unplayable games for the pure sake of creating unplayable games? Is it fine if you never release anything online? How private can you be in a medium where everything has to be shown or at least sketched out?  Only the last two questions interested me, the first one almost struck me as a stroke of masochism and an insult to the principles of game design. No creator would ever break their own levels – even the most disjointed of modern art pieces has a perspective from which a cohesive whole can be discerned.  To put it simply, there's a difference between a Rothko painting and an arbitrarily unclimbable staircase. The Rothko painting uses a single line across a white canvas to achieve its desired goal, to go through its expected process. It's not unfinished; the process is that single red line. On the other hand, The Beginner's Guide acts as though, say, electrifying the museum's main gates were part of the exhibit. There's a painting in there, you have to see it to obtain enough information to be able to land a cohesive opinion – but you can't enter the museum, since touching the front doors is painful. Then Davey Wreden the Helpful Tour Guide attempts to reify that electrified door, shuts down the power, follows you all the way to the painting you came to see and then blathers all over it, as if you had the inability to form some sort of opinion!  The game achieved its goal in that it made me feel something – and that does it credit, seeing as today's games rarely bother with empathy – but I rather would have felt something more noble, more involved, than the vague need to pull out my fake Arnold Schwarzenegger voice and yell “Davey, stahp eet!”  It gets a cautious thumbs-up.",

It goes from critics on the video game industry and on the players themselves towards topics of depression and schizophrenia. There's so much meaning hidden between the lines - it's like most (if not all) the Coda Games are a statement in itself: The lack of falling damage which the player normally expects in video games lets us carefully 'climb' down the boxes (Chapter 7, Down). The playability of video games concerning the players expecations and patience (several chapters; labyrinths, puzzles). And the way it deals with sensitive topics is breathtaking. So carefully.   ### VERDICT ###  The Beginner's Guide created a new Genre. It's kinda the evolution of novels, film and videogames. It is not comparable to other games yet. Most people won't regret buying it - there's just so much to get from it. It's a piece of modern art.    ",

I know a lot of people don't like walking simulators, but I wouldn't really classify this as a walking simulator. It's more like a museum simulator, and not only because it kinda does act like a museum for all of the games it shows off. And that's kinda what The Stanley Parable did, albeit in reverse for most of the paths through the game.  I came here from Extra Credits' Games You Might Not Have Tried: Winter 2015 video. It only took a couple seconds into the segment for me to immediately realize that I needed this game. I didn't even know it was made (or, well, compiled) by the same peson who made The Stanley Parable until it was stated outright by Wreden in the narration early on. My instincts did not disappoint me; this is the best game I've played this year.",

We both had our own perspective on what this game's intentions were and we were so sure we would be correct.

Nearly always the response is that video games have little biots of art but are mopstly just for fun and being violent. There are some games which look and sound immacualtely beautiful (my personal go-to in the discussion of video games as art is The Last of Us), but what this game does is show that video games can be an expression of oneself. It shows that video games aren't all about high scores and gameplay, they're about showing the player a piece of another person, a chance for the player to live inside someone else's head for a few hours.   I consider video games a very valid art form which is why I'm quite disappointed to see a lot of reviews criticising a game like this solely on the merit that it 'doesn't qualify as a video game', largely due to the lack of immersive gameplay. But some video games are meant to be expeierneced, and through them something more meaningful can be achieved.   I highly recommend playing this game, espeically if you've not seen any footage so far.",

From a practical standpoint you go places, you listen to commentary, follow the story and then it's over in roughly two hours. However that's not all what the 'game' is, it's a commentary on game developement, critical feedback, interaction between developer and audience and interpersonal relations. The story is fairly heavy and emotional particularly towards the end, unlike the lighthearted Stanley Parable humor here is rare and the game comes with a much more serious and depressed tone.  Recommended for those that aren't bothered by being lead around the enviroment. And those that like to listen and think about what they see and hear. This isn't a game for casual lighthearted fun.

It'll have to come with some qualifiers: It made me sad - I cried and now I sort of ache from the experience. The game in uncomfortable and intrusive but it's powerful and beautiful. So I do recommend it but you have to know that I would never say this game is a pleasant experience.  I think anybody who is any kind of creator should play this - at least to understand something about yourself and your own work if not your creative peers. I played this game all in one sitting, and I think that's how it should be played. The headspace it brings you to is an all at once type of experience.  Even if the story is fabricated, which is something I'm still debating, it is powerful. There's an honesty to it - about the lonliness and sadness that come with creation, with art. It leaves you feeling hollowed out and almost horrified but somehow I also feel renewed - energized about my work. I simeltaneously need the longest nap ever to recooperate but I also want to draw until my hands fall off.  At its essential core the game is telling you this - be honest to your art work. The creation has to be FOR you - the minute it becomes not for you, for pleasing other people, is the second you've lost yourself. I'm thankful for this game, despite my tears.",

I am a extrovert someone who enjoys interacting and reating to the world around me. But the experience of being placed in someine else's world was like nothing i have seen or done. To look it two people with two very different minesets and how they interact with one another is outstanding. On one side you have a frend that just wants to help and the other side is somone who doesn't need help or dose not processes himself as needing it. As i played i found my self thinking about what I was doing not as a game but as a intimate conversation with me and the creator. Which is something I have never experienced before. i found myself thinking of a game not as a game but as a history of life a diary or journal somthing that was intended for one person but timeless. This game has made me look back on my life and look at times that that had felt low or sad or whatever and think how it relates to other people, and think about things I have done to help that might not have bin the right thing to do. I fine myself thinking i always try to do the right thing and can never get it just right.

Or maybe a more appropriate rating would be 6 prisons out of a maximum of a whisper machine.  This game has so far been inspirational, unique, and personal. Far more personal than the Stanley Parable, which I also gave a 5/5. As I said though, the Beginner's Guide is unique, it is not the Stanley Parable. So even if you liked the SP, you may not get the same experience from this.  If you liked the Stanley Parable for its intelligent motives, meta design, and its thought provoking randomness, then you will like this game.  If you were more into SP for its witty narrator and collecting difficult achievements, then you may want to search for something else.  If you are interested in designing your own game, that provokes consideration by those playing it, then I would definitely suggest playing though TBG to get some inspiration. As a further note, when you buy this game, you are not buying a game. If you want to get 100 hours of play from $20, then I would not suggest buying. This game should be free, if it didn't also need to support the creation of more games along its line, and also compensate Davey Wreaden for his time creating it. It is the sort of game that should available to everyone, sort of like documentaries, or art funded by the government.  That's all.  Thanks for reading, hope it helps in making your decision.",

The main thing I will say is if you are looking for a game that will provide 100 hours plus of gameplay, this is not your game. If you are looking for a new experience or maybe you want to be left thinking and perhaps even inspired then you may wish to experience this relatively short but intriguing game.   At only an hour and 45 minute, give or take, there is not much to the game as far as hours to dollar but you may value more then hours played as in you may value your overall experience more, if so then I can recommend the game to you. Otherwise go get any other number of open world games that can provide 100's of hours of gameplay, if you are tired of those or just want something completely different then give The Beginner's Guide a try, it is the cost of a coffee and a donut so though short you could do much worse for your investment.",

I have to say this is really emotional. Like weirdly personal stuff. A deeply intimate tour of depression, antisocial tendencies, self-loathing for one man, and the feelings of abandonment and horrible guilt for the other. I guess I'm recommend it lol but it probably isn't for everyone. Purely from a value standpoint, it's not bad asking for $10 for about 90 minutes of 'gameplay' that you would otherwise never encounter in a video game, ever. Very unique. It's definitely asks the player to remain open minded about the medium itself and to explore an otherwise aimless game for the opportunity to dive deeply into two person's behaviors and thoughts for the sake of experiencing something.",

It felt like I was reading an interesting book, a deep thought driven journey that ends right before the characters resolve any of their issues. And that is what this game is, it's not really a game you play; although you play tons of little half done games. This game brought insight into the world of game development, as it follows half the journey of a game developer. Now it is written and narrated like the Stanley Parable, but it is far far far from the Stanley Parable. This felt like reading a personal narrative without someone's permission with an unrealiable narrator. I felt like I learned something, like I was moved by some of the conclusions the narrator comes too. I felt wrong playing these games, as if I was delving myself too deep into someone's world. I felt at some points that this game was meaningless, at others I felt as if it was a game everyone should expirience. And I left the game sad and confused, because this game hit home at the pain of reality, and it hits hard. It strains on themes of struggle, depression, the need for external validation, the game shows the pain in living. But the game only shows hope if you know where to find it, I would like to think I found hope to be a reocurring theme but I see why some didn't.   You think something, you're lead to believe certain things, that everything has a meaning, that there is this brokeness, even inherit pain, but what you find is that all of it is true and untrue. I honestly don't recommend buying tis game full price, wait till it is on sale or watch it on YouTube.   It is more of an expirience than a game, and the expirience betrays your trust, several ties over. I like those games, if you do too, than I suggest gettig it on sale.",

Pros: + Atmosphere/Story: Pretty interesting 'plot' that makes use of its medium in the sense that I feel like it would not work equally well as a book or audiobook. + Exploration: You get to see and interact with lots of surreal places. + Good Voice-Acting / Sound  Cons: - Really short (90 min for me, and I took my time), I might replay it once but in general there's probably not a lot replay value to it. - Walking Simulator: As mentioned above, you could watch someone else play it and see and hear exactly the same things. +/- Story: Definitely not everybody's cup of tea (check out some of the negative reviews for more details), but if what you have heard so far made you curious I would recommend trying it just for the unique experience.",

While the gameplay itself is little more than a walking simulator, the narration brings it to a higher, almost surrealistic level. This game sets you up for a lot of 'why?''s while you walk around and learn more about the story of the narrator and a programmer named Coda.  I guess it's not for everyone, but if you've even remotely liked games like Dear Esther or Gone home...this one is (IMHO) better.",

It'll have to come with some qualifiers: It made me sad - I cried and now I sort of ache from the experience. The game in uncomfortable and intrusive but it's powerful and beautiful. So I do recommend it but you have to know that I would never say this game is a pleasant experience.  I think anybody who is any kind of creator should play this - at least to understand something about yourself and your own work if not your creative peers. I played this game all in one sitting, and I think that's how it should be played. The headspace it brings you to is an all at once type of experience.  Even if the story is fabricated, which is something I'm still debating, it is powerful. There's an honesty to it - about the lonliness and sadness that come with creation, with art. It leaves you feeling hollowed out and almost horrified but somehow I also feel renewed - energized about my work. I simeltaneously need the longest nap ever to recooperate but I also want to draw until my hands fall off.  At its essential core the game is telling you this - be honest to your art work. The creation has to be FOR you - the minute it becomes not for you, for pleasing other people, is the second you've lost yourself. I'm thankful for this game, despite my tears.",

Let's face it, The Narrator is iconic as all hell.' And I was *seriously* wrong. Like, wrong on a MASSIVE level (well, wrong about the game-not-sticking-to-me part, at any rate).  This game will stay with you. It doesn't even matter if you'll like it or not- it'll stay with you. You'll think about something one minute and then think about the lampost the next. It'll stick to your mind, and to be honest, that's the best kind of game. The one that stays with you, and the one that you can see yourself in as clearly as you see a mirror.

Around three times on my own, and once with a family member and once with a friend.   It's very slow paced, but it definitely fits the game. Being a creator and having struggled with depression, this stroke a cord with me. It is a game that has moved me, and every playthrough has left me with a feeling of, 'Wow, what an emotional rollercoaster.' It is deep, and it's emotional, and I loved every single part of it.

However, if you're interested in a sort of interactive story, I think The Beginner's Guide approaches some really interesting topics and does so through the world of video game creation, which I really enjoyed. I will say that I found the ending somewhat frustrating (there was some heavy-handed leading early on in the game that make you think one thing, and think it for VERY valid reasons, then reverses it for a cheap sort of 'rug pull surprise' moment that seemed unearned) but I was still left thinking about it when I was done, and thinking about some of the moral dilemmas it brought up.

It is, in places, visually interesting. The narrator (and author) is actually a decent voice actor. It seems to attempt a deeper meaning than is readily clear and it may be compelling for some to think about. There are many theories and ideas about it's meaning popping up, and it has created some interesting conversations. There is some value in generating this kind of open table discussion, so far without any input from the author, but it boils down to third-party speculation about one individual's personal head space. Interesting for a philosophical symposium, but ultimately futile. Most reviews and threads I've read about it could be summarized with the statement 'Because I do not understand it, it must be deep and meaningful.' The author seems to have a message he wants to convey, but struggles with how to convey it. I think this was a rather personal game, made as a message, or apology, to a specific person. There is an extant interview with the author that backs this theory. The narrator is a sort of devil's advocate, playing as the person he wants to apologize to, while the fictional second character is the author himself. A kind of role-reversal, as if to say 'See, I know how you feel, and I'm sorry.'  In any event, it didn't leave me with a good feeling. The parts where the second character was railing at the narrator for needing a purpose or point in a game, felt like the author himself railing at gamers in general. In fact, it gave me the feeling that gaming itself is a futile waste of time and life. A strange message to convey in a game, and a depressing notion for a gamer. Even the part with all the notes left by fictional gamers felt like a condescending mockery of gamers in general, as if we are all a bunch of selfish, immature cretins demanding that the emotionally complex genius of a developer gut his poor soul for our entertainment. It seems to me The Beginner's Guide to disenfranchising your customer base. A feeling of unease, almost nausea, builds throughout. There was some potency in the final sequence, but mostly I was just glad for it to be over. After all that, the mopey song at the end just felt like cynical manipulation. What I think in a nutshell: the few negative reviews for The Stanley Parable really got to him and this is the result, a figurative middle finger extended to gamers. I could be entirely wrong, but that's the feeling it gave me. If it were free to play I might recommend it, but no one should pay actual money for what amounts to an expiremental, self-indulgent foray into a game developer's emotional state, personal life, and thought process. The message I got was -- making games is hard, emotionally taxing and psychologically draining for the tortured genius. Though a game may be published, it was not made for you, but is simply an expression of the author, a catharsis of artistic talent and technical skill which you do not deserve and could never possibly understand. It reminds me of juvenilia, the kind of poetry that teenagers write; deeply personal, self-centered, overwrought tripe that has little to no value for most other human beings.",

Seems like 'struggling to deal with something they do not understand'. GG WP i guess.",

I was prepared that it probably would be a little weird at times like TSP, but after playing the game I was left with this feeling like 'that was it?!?' 'really, that was it??!??'. I have been walking around in this game, hoping it would eventually lead to something, or the game would start right after this very long introduction, but no. So, curious to know if I was the only one out here with this feeling, I started reading some reviews and comments, everyone seemed to praise this game. It apparently made most people emotional, reflecting on their lives and so on.. But a fair number of people also experienced this game same way I did, glad it's not just me. So it's hard to say if I would recommend this game to anyone simply because there's no way of telling if you'll like it before you play it. It seems to me you have to experience the entire game to see if it does something for you personally. I checked 'No' because of my own experience and because I think he should release it for less money, like a symbolic 1 euro/dollar/pound/.. I know this sounds really cheap, but yeah I do think I paid too much for this. But as for now, I'll just let it all sink in for a while, maybe play it again someday, maybe not.",

I did, and an hour and a half later I felt very satisfied with my experience. So why am I not recommending this game? Well that's just it. It's not really a 'game.' Perhaps if this game was $1.30 or even free I'd recommend it, but it's not. Spoole's Law (that's what I'm calling it) dictates that for every dollar you spend on a game, you should get at least one hour of quality play time. This doesn't even come close to meeting that.   Ok, so this was genuinely enjoyable. At some points it felt reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, and I was alright with that. Problem is, this game is incredibly pretentious (among other things). I feel Davey did a genuinely rude thing by making this, and I don't want to reveal why because it would ruin the experience of the game. Many people are overreacting and saying this game is deep, or really sad, but it's painfully obvious those people just stretch their reactions to garner respect/attention. I saw one Irish guy cry over this game. Really? I guess part of the reason I'm incapable of seeing this game as sad is that I've gone through something similar to Coda. Worked down to the base level I've struggled immensely with depression, and I'm mostly past it now. I'm sick of these ♥♥♥♥ing morons putting on the facade of 'oh, this is sad because blah blah blah' shut the ♥♥♥♥ up. If you can't relate to something, don't even pretend to understand it. This game is much better as a character study of a depressed game developer telling his story than a pretentious think piece of a rude friend who tries make everything about himself.  I'd give this game an 7/10, but it's not worth the money right now. Give it a while or wait until it's on sale to buy it.",

This one was created by the same developer of the amazingly funny 'Stanley Parable', which was one of the few narrative games I actually feel is worth playing (but only once, since the magic is lost on replaying it). Unfortunately, The Beginner's Guide doesn't even offer that much.  Purportedly an exploration of an avant garde game designer's own developmental history, it is arguably an autobiography or just a tale-tale. What it isn't, is particularly enjoyable as it consists entirely of walking through poorly rendered levels of never-released test-games while the narrator drones on at you. The biggest - and only - mystery is what it all means: was the developer, as the narrator insists, a misunderstood genius whose games were his only way of expressing his insecurities? Or was the 'developer' just a representation of the narrator's own struggle with maintaining his creativity? Or is it something else? It's an interesting enough tangle that - fortunately - isn't wrapped up neatly by the end of the game but left to the player's own interpretation. Unfortunately, that is all the game has going for it. The 'mini-games' aren't games at all, so there isn't anything to actually DO in this game except walk continually forward. There's no point to exploration since there's nothing to find, and the game (purposely) lacks in visual polish. It's all well and good to leave the meaning of the game up to the player, but that only works if the player cares enough about the product to spare it some thought. Unfortunately, the presentation was so tiresome that I just preferred to walk away from it and find something actually INTERESTING to think about. ",

This game is known as being 'from the same guy that did the Stanley Parable', so comparisons with that very game are in order.  And I'd like to say that this game is nothing like the Stanley Parable. The former's about defying the narrator and breaking sequence, this one's a long, narrated corridor of interactions. Sure, it has a plot (which I feel has more than a few holes in it); but it's a simple, linear experience - much like reading this review, your only options are to continue or go do something else.  The plot, which is then the major selling point of the game (since interactivity really is not one), didn't feel that strong to me either. Without going into spoilers, I feel like the points it wanted to make could've been made in much less time and that the game was just artificially stretched to meet the 90 minute mark - and, throughout the whole experience, I'm simply a random spectator caught between Coda and the narrator, who really does not matter at all for the process. Like the message the game is trying to send is not meant for me.   So, much as I wanted it to get better, to make a sudden reveal and turn into a second Stanley Parable that amazed me and filled me with wonderment at every step, I'm afraid I must say it really is nothing of the sort. If you like short, linear games that talk about personal issues, then you may enjoy it - but then again, there are also other games that deal with those subjects in a much more engaging way than simply as a spectator.",

So, there is a lot of using the mouse and the WASD keys to walk the character through each part of the play. Throughout the whole 30 minutes of walking and narration, I kept thinking that there must be more to it than just walking through a story. I kept looking for the 'catch' and even explored the areas to find the secret...I never found any.   After 30 minutes I started to feel nauseous (it happens on some games). The nausea started during the scene with the 'notes' from other 'users' (another person noted they felt nauseous after a bit also). I decided to log off after that point and proceeeded to look up the reviews. After reading many reviews, the negative reviews verified that there was nothing more to the 'game', that there was no 'catch' and this really was all there was to it. I deleted it from my computer.   Graphics were okay but not anything like other story games I have played (some comments said they were great...hmmm). I believe this was all part of the set up of the play, though, so it fit. The narration was fine and spoken as a normal person trying to talk through his decisions for doing this, which was also appropriate for what the writers were trying to accomplish.  It is an interesting piece of visual writing/exploration, but it should not be listed as a game, it is not. It is more of a philosophical play...not sure what category that goes under! I keep quoting 'As You Like It' by Shakespeare...'All the world's a stage and the men and women merely players...' as I think about this 'game'.

I have found that I generally agree with what those who leave rational(!) negative comments state, even if I do not agree with their overall rating.

I am putting the uncertainty here, because I come from The Stanley Parable and was expecting a different experience. The game however does not indicate any branching paths.  First of all, the trailer feels misleading. In the trailer, you are given the impression that you will be able to explore a game world at your own pace and at your own discretion. The game itself is a linear narrative experience, where you are guided through it with almost no (to me known) ability to divert from the set path, like in The Stanley Parable. I did not enjoy it, but it probably helped keep up the pace and cohesiveness of the experience. I honestly expected to be rummaging through someones harddrive and find files on it.  Second, is that if you are expecting a Stanley Parable like experience, this is, as mentioned, not it. It is mostly about walking around, taking in your surroundings, combining it with the information given by the narrator and continue walking. The narration is serious and to the point. There are no alternatives, no clever ways to find hidden things. There are no meaningful discoveries to be made. The game tries to stand on its own without any clever subversive intentions.  Third, it is a short game and does not have replayability, because of the above mentioned reasons. Therefor the price to me feels too high.  I do not want to spoil any of the games narrative content, just can say that it is an emotional, not funny one.  If at some point, someone finds replayability in this game, then that would be great. Also I have checked my HDD to see if maybe all the games were there, like shown in the trailer, which was unfortunately not the case. If it gets cheaper and you want some quick to play narrative gameplay, which is well made, go for it. For now, I do not recommend it for fans of The Stanley Parable or as a game.",

I had my hopes crushed fairly quickly, as this game does NOT live up to the entertainment value of its predecessor AT ALL.  And I'm just gonna put it bluntly: The Beginner's Guide sucks.  All it is, is just you walking through a series of half-baked, barely interactive levels made by some random nobody, who is not the developer of The Stanley Parable, and you don't even get a sweet british narrator...   It's a shallow, unwitty, melancholic and pathetic barely one and a half tale about how a '~2 deep 4 u, oh woe is me~' amateur game developer that was friends with the creator of The Stanley Parable struggled with his first world problems and issues. While I was enthusiastic at the start, as the game does have potential with neat ideas for a very unique and interesting story, it fell apart quite shortly after the first few levels. The problem is just that I'm not emotionally engaged or interested in a story about how some asocial whiney person struggled with his personal issues while making pretentious games.  The Beginner's Guide is nothing more than an interactive documentary that should have been free, it's dull and boring, and dont expect anything funny or witty, cause TBG is all about depression and self-loathing and whatever.   I don't think it's all bad, it has cool concepts but It's just not fun to play, this should have been a free game or a youtube video, because it has ZERO replay value, unlike TSB.  Some people might enjoy this game though, if they can relate with the subject matter, or find it more engaging than I do. I'd much rather find this person and tell him/her to make The Stanley Parable 2 instead, and stop being so whiney.  Thanks for wasting my money, Davey. (and for having a 'skip level' button)",

Where TSP was immediately understandable to anyone who'd ever played a game, I don't feel that TBG's story is relatable to anyone who either isn't a content creator or who hasn't experienced a specific sort of anxiety. Most stories are capable of overcoming that boundary and still impacting people who can't personally related, but something about the narrative structure and abstract nature of TBG prevented that from happening. Though occasionally interesting, the plot can't support the game on its own.   Unfortunately, TBG has very little to stand on once its narrative fails. The game can barely be called that - most of the scenes consist of walking around hallyways and boxes with no opportunity for meaningful interaction or failure. What choices there are can be briefly interesting, but don't appear to change anything notable beyond the very short term. The exploration and experimentation that sustained TSP simply aren't here.   Recommended only either for $3 or less or (potentially) for people who've published work. Expect 60-100 minutes of playtime.",

But wow have I been played. After realizing I paid full price for this little manipulative piece of garbage I learned my lession.  To recap, that's what's bothering me: - The Tower: I really liked that 'episode', as it's pretty atmospheric in general. It gives off a thrilling vibe, unlike the rest. But there lies the problem: After considering the rest, it's existence is just that: Shock factor. It's a potshot to invoke 'feeling' by underhanded tactics. Blaring screen effects and screeching soundeffects when first 'interacting' are a dead giveaway.  - Shooting ♥♥♥♥ up: That was the only part I truly enjoyed, oddy enough the only part I can relate to at least a bit. Then I remembered how, oddly enough, this is something everyone can relate to: Scrapping old work, ideas. Again this is base level pandering to the crowd who came to seek some kind of personal experience. This sours the experience entirely after thinking about it long enough.   - Walking: Not that I dislike walking simulators, what I really hate is how one person can even ♥♥♥♥ up at that. Instead of rewarding the player for exploration, there'll be only a smug retourt by the narrator. It's as one dimensional of an experience as it can be. The lack of excellence isn't a stroke of genious, it's a golden turd of that genre.  - In your face message: It's the embodiment of the 'just be yourself' advice. It's pretty good at describing some baseline facts about lifes' struggles. That's it tough, the autors message as I got it was 'stop being ♥♥♥♥'. It's not conforting, it's not helpful, just inapropriate. The door-puzzle, the backwards walking segment, mazes, liteally distancing yourself and of course the 'suicide to ascent' portions feel cheap and spelt out. Again, if this was intentional, it still does not make it automatically good. Being ironic does not cure being moronic.  But enough rambling, some last advice so this review might be meaningful: Don't be a sheep. Don't listen to anyone is the lession learned. Maybe I am a bit jaded and salty, don't listen to me in that case. I can only speak for myself.",
