            "review_text": "Welcome, welcome, one and all. Now first thing's first, you should all be aware that this is the second of three games of the trilogy. So it goes without saying that you should play The Fruit Of Grisaia first, otherwise little here will make much sense.  The over-arching factors which seem to be splitting the community at the moment are price:length ratio and lack of an H-patch. Based on the fact that the first game had a 13 episode anime series based off it, whereas game 2 only had a double-length special, this did not come as a big surprise. That aside, I'm a rather large Grisaia fan, so I'm afraid I can't help you much if you're sitting on the fence because of this.  I've just finished the main route of the game, which details Kazami's life story leading up to his attending Mihama Academy. This incredibly detailed look into the past of the main character is something I so rarely see in Visual Novels, and the events which unfold show just how the sassy-yet-strong character we know and love came to be.  I've yet to play the afterstories, though I've no doubt that they'll live up to any expectations that the series provides.  My final verdict then would be this: if you want the H version and aren't too fussed about the rest, wait until that becomes available. Also, the price is considerable for an uncertain undertaking, but I'll stand by it being worth its value in quality if the quantity doesn't appeal. If like me though, you just wanted to dive right back in to the world and see what other stories they have to tell, then what are you waiting for?",

            "review_text": "honestly when i saw this came out i was so hyped i bought it right away but when i saw to h-scences it went to check if there was a patch for it. but i found out in my search that they even cut out the dirty jokes in this version and now i feel extremely disapionted cause now i don't feel like i got what i paid for one of the best parts about grisaia was its dirty jokes. honestly i could live without the h-scenes its still cut content but in the end they didn't add anything but by cencoring the diaolge like that that are harming the core content it self. now i am going to have to re-go over the routes i finished when the 18+ version realeses to get the full experience and i hate re-reading stuff i have already read. this whole thing has actualy ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off. i love this series and the fact that i can never truly get the full experience anymore makes me angry. and i honestly feel cheated out of my money because they altered the core content.  in short if you really like grisaia wait for the 18+ version regardless if you want h-scences for the full experience.",

I have high hopes for this one too. I think anyone can play it and enjoy it and if you are straight all the better! If you haven't already already played kajitsu ( the fruit of Grisaia ), do it now, it's worth it.",
