            "review_text": "  If you are into hardcore sim racing titles, get this one or rf2. Miles ahead of every other so called sim title and i own multiple older and current competitor games:  Pro AMS: - high frequency physics and ffb updates - dynamic roads - dynamic time of day - wide range of different cars - obscure tracks you don't find in other sims + mod tracks to get the ones you know - low system requirements meaning you can play this on eyefinity in 5760x1200 with 60fps - easy to mod - limited eyecandy = better concentration, less errors due to OH LOOK A SHINY THING - gearbox simulation with grinding gears, double downshift protection, realism stuff - per car driving help options, ie. you can disable ABS overall but have it activated for the Mini EDIT: - online experience will be expanded (time trial leader boards, official servers, league finder...)    Contra AMS: - No dynamic weather - obscure tracks you probably have never seen - no dynamic shadows - limited eyecandy - online participation low b/c game not as popular as PCars or AC - rFactor 1 like AI, i guess there were changes in AIW files, but not in the overall AI behavior EDIT: - on mod Tracks buggy HUD (dynHUD), i resort to the base HUD in that case - rf1 AI Problems. No defensive lines, problems on lap 1, problems in slow corners   Last but not least. Amazing Company. Amazing Support! I got this game for free because i owned GSCE and Forumla Truck. This was my free update, and there is more free stuff beeing added every month it seems. Can't wait for DLCs and Reiza2017 Project. EDIT: Well, free content is not coming every month anymore. A few free bits are problably still coming...There are now DLCs announced and i brought the SeasonPass to save money.   Fully Recommended!  EDIT: Alter 100+hours still fully recommended! Having a blast with the CommunityTimeTrials on RaceDepartment",

            "review_text": "This sim is simply amazing. It has evolved so far from its early inception as game stock car. At the heart of the sim It has motorsports pedigree physics courtesy of Niels Husinkveld. The car models, skins, tracks, menus, force feedback, wheel support, sounds etc, every thing is 10/10. in its most recent incarnation as Automobilista, the wheel rotation is adjusted per vehicle automatically if you so choose for ease of use, and there is a multiplyer adjustment for low speed force feedback so our cheap wheels despite their limitations can feel full feedback even at lower speeds. Every car is utterly brilliant and so distict in it's handling. The only thing that is not a 10/10 is the behaviour of the karts, but that is no fault of the developers, it is just the limitation of the aged and heavly modified rfactor engine. Niels is more than capable of producing top notch kart physics.Reiza studio's has extracted every last drop of performance from the RF1 engine, Hats off to everybody at Reiza studio's, can't wait to see what they do next.",

            "review_text": "I was going to delete my old review, but then thought it would actually be best to leave it up, because I don’t think my experience with this title is unique. In short, my initial impressions of the AMS were observationally correct, and yet simultaneously completely…utterly…wrong. You can read the original review below this one.   After doing a little reading, I decided to reinstall the game and give it another go last week. This time, armed with a little pre-knowledge and a more realistic expectation of the setup curve, my experience was completely different.   First, the force feedback. I own and play (PCars, AC, R3E, and rF2) and IMO, with a little bit of tweaking, AMS has arguably some of the best force feedback I’ve ever felt in a sim. And by a little bit of tweaking, I mean simply adjusting one setting in the .ini file to dial out any clipping from the default settings. A small bit of clipping is perfectly okay, but the devs claim the defaults settings, allow about 20-30% clipping. Not sure what wheel they tested that on, but on my CSW-V2, the default gain setting for the cars in the base installation allows a little too much clipping in the high-speed corners for my tastes. Not a big deal, very easy to dial out. And once you do, the cars will feel amazing. :)  Second, the graphics. This was a big turn off for me the first time I tried AMS. Yes, I realize graphics aren’t the end-all-be-all measure for sim titles, but, coupled with what I thought at the time was poor FFB and a poorly designed GUI, the outdated looking graphics made me feel as though it wasn’t worth the time to negotiate the setup curve of the title. What I didn’t realize at the time was, AMS’ built-in graphics processing is terrible, but you don’t have to use it. By turning off almost every in-game graphic setting, and simply creating a profile in my GPU driver for AMS, and allowing the GPU to handle most of the processing, I was able to use the enhanced HDR setting in AMS, and it looks like a totally different game—very much comparable to any other modern title. When properly configured through the GPU, the outdated graphics gripe basically becomes a complete non-issue.   Third, the GUI. Yes, it appears a bit cluttered and hard to navigate, but the more time I spend with the title, the more I seem to be discovering the method behind the madness. AMS remembers the little things, like which track you were driving in each particular car and what difficulty level you were using with that particular car/track combo. The latter was a welcome surprise, considering AI difficulty often varies by car/track combo. I believe some of these little conveniences that have been revealing themselves are made possible, in part, if not completely, by the way things are broken down and organized in the GUI. And, to be honest, after a few days of play, the GUI doesn’t seem nearly as chaotic as it did on day-one. :)  So, as much as I’d like to say, “Please ignore my previous review.” I think reading them both is best, because there’s a good chance you’re going to be feeling some, if not all, of the things I felt about the game when I first tried it a few months ago. The thing to remember is, while all my past observations were indeed true, they only apply to the out-of-the box installation. With a little patience—a browse through the community forum and possibly a Google search or two—the initial installation can be transformed into a real racing pleasure that should appeal to just about any sim fan.   Verdict: AMS is a definite must have for sim fans.    Below is my original review. :o --------------------------------------------  I heard a lot about this game and was excited about the track evolution aspect. After downloading it, and selecting the  No Assist  option, I then spent about 20 minutes trying to find out why it was still auto upshifting for me. After a Google search, I discovered that selecting  manual  wasn't enough (WTH??). There was a second setting for upshifting. Whatever, I moved on and started tackling the FFB. It felt promising, but when I went to start dialing it in, I realized there was no FFB meter (again... WTH?). I found a lot of information online, telling me to make manually adjustments in the config .ini files. That seemed a little archaic, and coupled with the lack of an FFB meter, I was just really turned off at this point.   To make matters worse, the graphics are very, VERY dated looking, compared to just about any racing game made within the past 7 years. I have a GTX 1080 and had the settings cranked, viewing it on a 4K screen. It still looked dated. Even the onscreen HUD overlays looked like they were made for a kid's game.   At the 1.5 hour mark, I just gave up an returned it. If I didn't already have three sims that I was thoroughly enjoying, I might have spent more time trying to massage AMS into shape. But there just seemed to be too much blind fiddling required.   Verdict: Refunded.",

            "review_text": "Don't often write recommendations but this is one of those times. Going to write it in order of 'Pros', 'Average', 'Cons'.  PROS: -Physics are absolutely on point. (Cars like the V8 Super cars, Go-Karts, touring cars and F3), The levels of grip given to each wheel at certain times, and the way the car 'dances', like it should in lots of cases, it's completely unmatched by any other sim . EG, taking a corner, and the FR wheel hits a bump, you don't just feel it amazingly well in the FFB, the cars weight shifts extremely well, creating more lean on the LF tyre, the suspension then reacts to it, changing grip levels of both those tyres and the movement of the car. The list goes on and on about the reactions of the cars in different curcumstances. You can also feel the effects of the downforce much more through the FFB and car control. Take the Formula 3, at high speed the car is much more planted, but at lower speed the wheel requires far more steering input as the downforce becomes almost non-existant and you are rellying on mechanical grip. Also, the suspension physics are immaculate, low speed reactions to bumps and kurbs is great.   -Force Feed Back, Simply unmatched. No other sim is even close, 'Nuff said really.   -Management... Yes, you have to manage tyre and brake temps. If you have the HUD on, you can see your brake and tyre temps in detail. Don't keep your tyres and brake temperatures up, they become less effective.   -Car list, is fairly vast.... Go-Karts/X-cross/V8 Super cars/trucks/F3 etc etc    Average:  -Now one thing that got hyped, and rightly so, was the AI. The AI is great, far better than other titles I've played in Sim's. You can change their aggression, and skill level in percentage right up to %120. They'll do pretty well to hold their own on the track. But, and it's a big but, They also still hold big features that make you strongly remember they are AI. For example, AI does not have a clue what a blue flag is.... Imagine, you get out first in quallifying, get the tyres and brakes up to temp on that outlap, then full steam ahead down the Start/finish to start your flying lap. Just to be met with %50 of the AI coming out of the pitlane, and that don't react to blue flags.... It's such a simple thing that destroys the element of the AI supposedly being 'human'. Also when you change their aggression to 'extreme', they still are very cautious about passing you and defending. I lost my wing in F3, and completely removed myself from the racing line and slowed down to around 50mph, and moved right to the edge of the track, and there was still a queue of AI behind deciding on whether it's safe to pass me or not. Also, they don't defend as aggresive as this setting suggests, they often leave the door wide open. But the plus side in that is that they do try to counter attack..... Another note with the difficulty level, is it's too easy in some cases. I had the super Karts at Spielburg (I know I spelled that wrong), and I naturally have the dificulty set to %110. Within 17 minutes practice I was the quickest driver on track by .4 of a second... I reset the difficulty to %120, and within 45 minutes practice I was still the qiuckest driver by .3 of a second. It should be a tad more difficult imo. 45 minutes practice, without ever driving that vehicle, should have me at the back of the pack somewhere...... BUT, In general race-craft, the AI is a huge improvement, and is actually fun and difficult to race against for the most part.    CONS:  -Graphics, it's not a huge dissapointment, but at some points it does feel very outdated. I'm running Maximum detail and it doesn't look right. I'm seeing jagged lines with Full detail and 16x AA. I feel i'm mising something, and the opponents cars give that old school floaty and pixelated look at 50+ meters. Maybe that's something at my end, but it's a bit of a turn off. Doesn't reflect the fun you have while driving though that's for sure.   -Setting up the wheel. Now this is only if you are a perfectionist, like me. You may find yourself going back and forth changing the settings, but if you aren't new to sims and Race in the likes of iRacing, you may be more used to it. But it does seem to take a bit more effort. The con is only the time it takes, but it definitely returns reward when you dial the settings in.   -Multiplayer. The public servers are a ghost town, everybody who has this Sim, and races online, races in a league no doubt.   -Mods, I went searching for them on RaceDepartment. And there wasn't a huge amount. A lot of the tracks were made by 'Patrick', or something. And there are barely any quality tracks, the only quality tracks existing were the ones made by this 'Patrick'. One Gentleman said that this is down to the Devs not releasing info on the game to support modders making tracks, specifically the shaders. I don't know how much truth is in this, but it does go as a con in my book if it is truthful.   Overall, if you're a heavy sim-enthusiast get it, just buy it. You are missing out on something amazing. But you should really look to get into a online league, because the Public MP servers are dead. Also, a league is just normally far more fun anyway than the public lobby bangers.",

Other sims might do some individual things better, but overall, only iRacing beats AMS in my opinion, and you'd have to spend way more money. It's a shame the multiplayer isn't more popular, but the leagues are good, and racing against the AI is, I think, the best of any comparable sim.   This started off as a few people making a mod for rFactor, how have they done so incredibly well?! I might have been a bit miffed at the cost if I hadn't recieved AMS for free after owning GSCE, but I shall be buying a season pass, these people deserve to be supported!",
