    "description": "In Unreal Estate, the City Council has hired you to build the best cityscape, which you’ll do by drafting buildings to your hand. Rejected designs go to the Scrap Pile, but as demand for those buildings grows, you can reclaim them to score the most points. But be careful that the other architects don’t score them before you!",
