            "review_text": "TL;DR You should play LEGO Marvel Super Heroes instead. I enjoyed this game as a (forgiving) Marvel nut, but I would not recommend it to the average consumer.  When LEGO Marvel's Avengers was first announced I got very excited. LEGO Marvel Super Heroes was by far my favorite LEGO game, and I've always been a huge MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) nerd. So when I heard a new LEGO game was being developed based specifically on the MCU and the Avengers movies, I was ecstatic. However, when I finally got my hands on the game, I was... rather disappointed.  The story mode is a pain to get through. While the first game had a fun and entertaining story, this game retold the Avengers films  badly . They used audio clips from the actual films, and created cutscenes around them that just... didn’t work. Throughout the actual gameplay, depending on who you played as, you got to hear a mixture of badly-implemented audio lines from the films, and newly-recorded lines for the game. The game would've been much better if they'd just recorded new audio for  all  of the characters, even if it meant recasting most of the characters who appeared in the films.  To the game's credit, six actors from the films reprised their roles and recorded new audio for the game, and they were all fantastic. Clark Gregg (Phil Coulson) and Cobie Smulders (Maria Hill) were the largest contributors, but you also got to experience a fair number of Free Play side quests from Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter and Ashley Johnson as Waitress Beth. Additionally, Ming-Na Wen narrated the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. DLC level as Melinda May, and Michael Peña narrated the Ant-Man DLC level as Luis. Hearing them all reprise their roles was an amazing treat.  Now, let's talk about what made the game worth playing for me: Free Play. That's always the best part of any LEGO game. However, you need to play through the  entire  story mode to get to most of the Free Play features (and if you don't poke around menus too much you might not even realize how to get to Free Play at all before completing the story mode). And playing through the story mode is  tedious . The fact that you basically need to beat the entire campaign before you can really start having fun is why I don't recommend this game to the average consumer.  Free Play itself is a blast. As a major MCU nut I really appreciated a lot of the characters they included in the game just so that major fans would notice. The day I unlocked Lorelei I was overjoyed.  They remembered Lorelei!  I was so happy. I also loved the inclusion of the MCU lineup of the Defenders, although I'm pretty sure whoever wrote and directed Jewel's dialogue clearly never read Alias or watched Jessica Jones. That was about the farthest you could possibly get from any version of Jessica's personality.  Playing through levels and being able to switch between awesome characters at will has always been a major draw for Lego games. In recent years they’ve implemented overworld hubs as well, which is one of my favorite parts of the games. However, in this game you don't  just  get to explore Manhattan like you did in LEGO Marvel Super Heroes; you also get to explore seven other smaller hubs, including locations like Asgard and Tony Stark's estate at Malibu. Exploring them to find all of the secrets and unlockables is a  blast .  That's something that's very interesting about the game: The inconsistency of quality. Some parts of development, such as the art department responsible for creating the environments in the game, completely outdid themselves in creating amazing and beautiful levels and hubs to play through. You can also tell a lot of work was put into the fight animation, as a lot of it is really cool. But sometimes you’re required to watch through an entire automated battle while mashing whatever button is on the screen, and this is especially tedious when you're in Free Play and just wish the story elements would  go away .  Yes, some parts of the game, such as the environments, were impeccably well-made; but on the other hand, the game is a complete mess. Sometimes activating panels just doesn't work. Sometimes your map says you can collect something that's already been collected. Sometimes a vehicle will fall off a level in a way so that it never spawns on stable ground again unless you restart the level. Sometimes you can meet the requirements of an achievement, but it won't unlock because you exited a level the wrong way, and you might need to create a whole new save file to try and get it again. This game needed a much bigger QA team, far more than any other LEGO game has before it.  The hub side-quests are inconsistent as well. Sometimes a lot of work was clearly put into them. Others were just weird and sloppy. It really is strange how often this game flip-flops from fantastic to downright annoying. This can be said for some of the in-level puzzles as well.  Speaking of which, DLC. I'm not going to rage here about how the Season Pass doesn't include all of the DLC that it should, but...  it really doesn't . The DLC levels themselves are fun, and I love the additional characters that come with them. However, that fact that we're given all of the characters from a DLC pack right off the bat is just sad. The best part of having so many playable characters in these games is the journey it takes to unlock them. Having all of the characters from a DLC pack available before you even play the level makes the whole experience… kind of lackluster.  However, I do briefly want to talk about how happy I am that they included an Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. level pack. To have a LEGO game based on the MCU and not at least include a sizeable slew of S.H.I.E.L.D. characters would have been terrible missed opportunity. My only complaint with the DLC is that Skye's in-game character is named as her (spoilery) real name, when the level takes place at the end of S.H.I.E.L.D. Season 2, when she still went by the name Skye. For how much detail they attend to, I felt it a shame that they forwent it for marketing purposes.  As a huge Marvel and MCU fan, the experience was worth it to me. Playing through the game in Free Play with a huge cast of Marvel characters both from the films and the comics is, frankly, a total blast. But in order to unlock most of that experience, you first need to play through a tedious and poorly-made story mode, that I would say makes the game not worth it to the average consumer. If you truly want to enjoy yourself with a beautiful marriage of everything that’s good about Marvel and LEGOs, I highly recommend you check out LEGO Marvel Super Heroes instead.",

Thoroughly enjoyed the Story Mode, and I'm still left with much to do. Don't go into this expecting Spiderman, Deadpool, and others of the like, as this game is centered around the MCU. I found it was very accurate to the films, and as always had the touch of LEGO humour, hats off to Traveler's Tales.   Overall verdict, 9.7/10, as it could always be better, but I was very happy with it, and I'm looking forwards to the DLC and Season Pass content.",

The problem is that the levels are mostly boring and unengaging. Beating the game at times felt more like a chore than a fun time to kick back and play some games. But if not for the campaign, than you should buy it for the sandbox levels. The game lets you explore a huge open world map of many places throughout the world, including but not limited to, Manhattan New York, Miami California, Washington D.C., and even Asgaurd! Imo, the open world locations are much more fun than the campaign levels. One of the only other problems with the game though, is that still, even to this day, TT games fails to bring us online multiplayer. Which sucks. Because some of us don't have any irl friends.",

Like Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham it features way more to do and way more to see than ever before. Though it sacrifices that Lego charm we've seen over the years.   On the surface it has everything you want out of a Lego Game, but it soon reveals it's flaws. For starters the game treats you like an idiot with more cutscenes and camera cuts than any other Lego Game. Visually ripping you from gameplay every minute to camera loom over what you're supposed to do next far too long.  Second, all the cute Lego gags that poked exceptional fun at the source content is gone. Replaced by cringe-worthy chicken jokes and a way way way waaay overused food gag.  Thirdly, the levels are just plain uninteresting. They expand the films by letting you play through things inbetween scenes you never cared about and then draw out scenes you do want to play through then making them quite boring.   Though one thing i'd like to put in it's defense is it seems to have put as much detail into the individual characters as Lego Batman 3. All in all, go for it, it's another notch in the Lego Game belt, but made to a lower standard than some. Hope this helps!",

I'm not saying Superheroes was a bad game, but it had some bugs and flaws that Avengers really improved on (we can all agree that the flying mechanics are garbage, right?). The hub world's mostly the same area (New York), but with the addition of smaller hubs such as Barton's Farm, Asgard and the S.H.I.E.L.D base, it's a lot more fun and diverse, with side missions and puzzles a lot more organised. They also have less repetitive phrases (Because if I heard 'Ugh, watch it buddy!' one more freakin' time I would've turned green and smashed my computer) They've also got a new system which has crimes take place that you can stop, like robberies and mugging. Really, Avengers is just Superheroes again but with more polished gameplay.   The only real downside to Avengers is that, since it's following the MCU, there's much less diversity in the characters. This means there are no Spider-Man, Fantastic 4 and X-Men characters to be found (except Spidey himself and a few alternate costumes such as Civil War and Iron Spider, but that's in a DLC). This is a shame because I loved playing with more characters. Though the new Ms Marvel character pretty much plays the same as Mr. Fantastic did.  The helicarrier is also different, with the collector taking Deadpool's place as the red brick distributor. Also, the custom character maker has been greatly improved, with easier selection and more characters to use parts from. If you've unlocked the minifig, you can use its parts. The X-Mansion has been replaced with the Avengers Facility, and the lighting is different, set in the evening/morning as the sun is a little lower.   All in all, Lego Marvel's Avengers is an awesome game.",
