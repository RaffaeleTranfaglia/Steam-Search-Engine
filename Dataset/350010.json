            "review_text": "This is a tough one as I know this is quite an older game but even counting that, this is by far the weakest Artifex Mundi game I have played. The story really isn't very engaging and while a good effort has been made to update the graphics its still very obvious this was one of Artifex Mundi's first titles. There is some fun to be had with the hidden object scenes and the puzzles are ok though a little on the easy side. A few scenes in the end (Im looking at you haberdashery) were still quite muddy even at high res, making some objects a little hard to find. Look, I had some fun with the puzzles in this and Im going to give it a recommendation with caveats. If you have never played an Artifex Mundi game go and nab Ghosts of Maple Creek or Nightmares From the Deep: The Cursed Heart instead. If you have all their games already, just go into this one aware that its showing its age.",

            "review_text": "It's.. okay. The main problem is that by the standards of more current Artifex Mundi games... it's kinda rubbish.  The game itself is a hidden object game - where other games by this dev are a mix of point and click adventure and are fairly story heavy in this the storyline is a poor attempt to give you a reason for solving a seemingly endless stream of hidden object puzzles. The puzzles themselves are rather grainy which makes spotting certain images within them more difficult than they should be. The storyline... well to be honest it's awful and makes absolutely no sense at the end.  If you don't mind the terrible accents and grainy visuals and want something that is predominantly hidden object oriented rather than a mix of things then this may be an okay game to try. I wouldn't recommend it as an intro to Artifex Mundi games though as it hasn't aged all that well.",

One big flaw on this is that there are many moments where the characters are talking and the way the animation is done just looks awful, easier for them to just have the talking bits &amp; portraits pop up with the characters posed than talking here.",

Love the bizzare looking facial animations (just because they look so weird). Not a lot of variety in the other puzzles, but there were no real 'stumpers'. If you like this type game, it gets a thumbs up from me. (Certainly wait for a sale of course...). Not much replay value in this one so plan on about 3-4 hours of play.",

I usually try to avoid using hints or skipping mini-games, but this game just didn't grab my interest, so I found myself using those way more often than usually. The voice acting wasn't very good, and the character's faces distorted in a strange way when they spoke. Most of the dialogue sounded very forced and unnatural. Some of the hidden object puzzles had really bad graphics, so it was hard to make things out. A lot of them also had this annoying light effect where the light was constantly going from darker to lighter and back. I liked the story, but the implementation was bad enough to make the game not so enjoyable.",

The set up of the scenes was okay. There was a little repetition here and there. The voice acting and script, which seems to have bothered others, was a highlight for me. I found it refreshing to see and hear 'proper' English. Soz :P The story started out well, but I admit I had lost interest towards the end and 'skipped' to finish. Achievements are super easy, most dropped as I was playing and I only had to focus on the time one. The puzzles were okay, I found them easy enough but I am rather good at those anyway. Conclusion: The repeated focus and lighting problem prevents me from recommending this title.",

I just hope that the other Time Mistery games are better than this. 4/10",

I think this is the first time I've ever voluntarily started playing the minigame alternative so I didn't have to hunt hidden objects. The HO screens are all soft-focus and dull. The minigames are dull. The story is more holes than plot. I was fighting my way through just for the sake of the achievements, and then decided that they weren't worth putting up with this game.",

Pros: -creative hidden picture games     Cons: -graphics are 'meh'...I thought this was remastered -voice acting is really bad especially for Michael and Vivien sounds like an old lady at times -story is repetitive and boring  I understand that this is one of their older games but I really can't recommend this one. All in all this game is not worth it, trust me. If you want to play a good Artifex Mudi game then play Time Mysteries 2 and 3 with Esther Ambrose, those games have much, much, much better stories by far and are just more fun in every way. One thing that I liked were the creative hidden picture puzzles. I wish all Arifex Mundi games could be interesting like Time Mysteries 2 and 3 but lately their games have gotten a bit 'sad' for lack of a better word. I'm warning you now: DO NOT GET THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

Couldn't care about the story, the tentative facial animations are atrocious, too much repetition. It even repeats 'rush hour' type puzzles - yawn. Also no no hints/rule/goal to many mini game/puzzle sequences. Messy art style on HO scenes.",

You can pass the game but it's highly disappointing.  ----  Unsatisfying and creepy. Decent enough to get on the cheap (&lt;$5).  A lot of little things bugged me. Nothing game-breaking. *some voice overs got cut off. *mystery guy sounds like a robot. *inconsistent/eroneous object clues. *many differences to spot are too subtle *weird pulsing of light in HO sections is very annoying. *I appreciate the sonar. However, showing objects as they appear behind other objects usually ends up more as a hinderance. *vague plot point at the end is never elaborated on.  What really made it creepy for me is the weird photomanipulations in the cutscenes. It would have been enough to make the lips move but trying to make 2D images move like 3D was a mistake in my opinion. The sad part is that all that effort was probably an aspect of the 'remastering'.  It was functional and mostly enjoyable but I wouldn't rush out to get it. There are no added frills. The achievements are attainable and I've definitely played worse.",
