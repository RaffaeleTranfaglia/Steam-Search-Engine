    "description": "Don’t Shoot Rabbit is a mini game, as my first completed game product. Though I didn’t provide English UI support, it won't be too difficult to understand how to play it. One round may take 3-5 minutes to play, to win all trophy it may take 0.5-1 hour, or maybe more. Compete with your friends, win a high score, and play fun!",
