Car selection is practically non existent but knowing the budgets of these small studios, it's not an issue since the game is fun and more importantly, keeps you playing. Multiple modes with an interesting strategical mechanic of applying your Burnout points towards your final time. 99 cents.",

I suspect it's going to get comedically difficult as the career progresses but I like the risk / reward of the boost system being converted to time at the end. This means that being conservative with the boost can help you win the race even if you are not first across the line. Gameplay-wise, it feels like Flatout, if not quite as good as Bugbear's classic racing games.",

Essentially take the fastest accelerating car. When you take a turn you lose 60% of your speed. Turning is horrible. Essentially it forces you into a super sharp drift or into a slight turn (there is no in between). Also make sure you stay far far ahead of the AI. They have the tendency to crash straight into the wall and screw you over.   I guess this is what happens when you are trying to make a mobile game and figured out once you were finished that you used the wrong language/engine or something. That or you have some Chinese/Indian developers looking to get some real quick cash.",

            "review_text": "When you can't even change the graphical options in the game and every time you restart the game, any changes you made in the menu reset, you know you've made a bad purchase. And that's starting with a bad first impression, but ignoring that, is there anything else to this game? No. The presentation, besides being buggy, is boring, the music is just a loop of a few notes, and that's me being gentle, I don't want to sound subjective by saying 'the music is crap', and the races are just boring as hell. So, all in all, it's a boring game. The handling is awful, it's like in no other racing game that I've ever played, but please don't get intrigued, it's just terrible. And there's no reason to even race in this game, aside from unlocking a few cars and paints. The bugs are running wild in this game and there's no way the devs, Nemesys, are even trying to support their game. This game just sucks.",
