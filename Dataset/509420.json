            "review_text": "Fantastic horse game where you can actuallly compete live against other players. There are so many different courses covering show jumping and tricky twisty agility courses which are well thought out and well laid out. Varying degrees of difficulty for new players to pro's. And the horses actually do lead changes Multiple colors for your horses, probably the widest range I have ever seen on a horse game I adore this game, I've played when it was a stand alone, then since day 1 from the Facebook release and will now play here too. Yes, it has microtransactions, but unless you really cannot wait to advance, you can quite easily play for free, I reached max level without payig a cent.  There is a weekly competition that's great fun and you have to earn a place in the final on Sundays, pretty good prizes too. The action points run out a bit fast, but there are upgrades that you can use to extend them and make them fill faster. There are things to do that don't need them, Course editor where you cn make and publish your own courses, or just save them to practise on, challenge your friends with the free social tickets you get each day when you log in or just chat while they refill. Overall gets 11/10 from me",

I try try try again until I can make tumbleweed, then I found the grooming option. Never playing another game on steam, unless it is to do with horses. I was hoping to frollock in the padock with my friend and his horse NIgel, I'm sad that wasn't a feature. Please, Riding Club Championship gods, add that as a feature. I want to see my friends black and ginger horse! --------------------------------------- It's been 7 days, still no sign of paddock frollocking, I've gone into a deep depression. Please help me, Nigel is starting to get rejected and I can't help him because I can't visit other people. All mighty gods, let me save Nigel from this horrible neglect....   10/10 ign",
