            "review_text": "Bloodbath Kavkaz is another top down shooter just like Hotline Miami, but will you want to play this or go back to Hotline Miami ? The answer is you want to run away as fast as possible. Bloodbath Kavkaz is promoted as a parody of Hotline Miami, but it really is a not funny joke. The game follows on Shamil. Shamil recovers from a car crash and wakes up in a limo and a man by the name Vasily task you to kill a man named Jafar before the dawn or otherwise he will kill Shamil. So how is this game ? This game is one of the worst games I have ever played. The game is a blatant rip off of Hotline Miami and they came under fire and changed a lot of stuff, some of the stuff that was changed was the name from Hotline Kavkaz, the dialogue screens and more minor stuff. This game is also incredibly difficult due to the incredibly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ controls. I finished the game in around two hours so it's also incredibly short. The game says it has different endings but all of them are the same endings even though clearly you have different choices. The only good thing about this game is that some of the songs from the soundtrack are pretty good, but a lot are bad. The game has bad level design, bad controls, garbage story and awful graphics. Who would buy this over Hotline Miami is beyond me. This is not worth your time and hard earned money. I give Bloodbath Kavkaz a 2/10  For more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page  here  - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!",

            "review_text": "This is probably one of the worst games I've played so far on steam. Which doesn't come as a surprise, honestly. Sure, I've played less functional games, but they were also way shorter. I've played really long, boring games, but functional. This one kinda gets the perfect blend between length and broken gameplay.  Let's get this out of the way. I don't think the soundtrack of this game is atrocious, I've heard worse, so this so far is the only positive point I can think about this game. Everything else feels like a really bad bootleg Hotline Miami, there's bootleg Beard, bootleg masks, bootleg everything. It's full of memes everywhere, which I'm not sure if I would classify as brilliant, or cringe worthy, being a memeomancer myself.  The visuals on the levels are pretty much what you'd expect from hotline miami, but less polished. THe characters, though, look like something out of microsoft paint, there's no single character I've seen that's pleasing to look at. The same goes for their illustrations when they are talking.   The audio, is pretty bland, if you don't count the music. Every time you kill an enemy or an enemy spots you, they yell ♥♥♥♥ in russian. This can be beneficial, because you KNOW when an enemy has seen you, unlike in Hotline Miami where you would get sniper from across the map. The problem is, the yelling with the same voice over and over and the annoying censor bleeps get annoying incredibly fast.   The game's quite broken. Here are a few things I've noticed so far:  +The translation is quite bad, like a character saying 'Remember when I f ucked your mouth in the a ss?', unless they meant that.  + The game often goes back to russian when I try to go back to the main menu.  + If you click near the edges of the game's screen, flash options will pop up, and if you were holding any of the WASD keys, you're going to get stuck walking in that direction unless you bring up the steam overlay.   + It's possible to go through a wall on a few levels, you just gotta pick up a gun when you're with you back against the wall. I discovered this accidentally, but it's quite possible to speedrun levels this way, not having to go through most of the level killing enemies. (Thank god!)  + The achievements are broken. After clearing the first level, I got two achievements. One that you get when you die the first time, and another one, for not dying in that level. I died 7 times. The game gave me both achievements.  + Your hitbox doesn't match your character model. You can get shot even if you think you're behind cover. You'll get stuck on walls and doors all the time. It's quite annoying  Also, unlike HM's smooth and responsive controllers, the ones in this game are jittery and feel kinda laggy. It's quite hard to shot enemies in this.   In short, I got this game as a gift, and I frankly feel insulted. I was expecting to get some good laughs at how bad this game was going to be, but the laughs quickly turned into frustration. Stay away from this game, it's not worth it. It's too late for me, because I feel like I gotta get the achievements in this piece of ♥♥♥♥. Wish me luck.    ",
