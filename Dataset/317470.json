            "review_text": "I do not recommend even trying this game unless you have a whole lot more money than sense or you hate yourself. Or both.  You start in a simple tutorial zone which is meant to give you the basics of how to play in an easy to understand manner. I can't comment much on this, because my tutorial stopped working and crashed before I got to learn how to 'pick ♥♥♥♥ up' upon re-opening the game, I ended up with my starter materials wandering around the overworld with no idea what was going on and no way to get back to the tutorial.  Once you pass (or otherwise end up at the end of) the tutorial, you are placed in one of three 'worlds' which consist of hundreds of tiny and bland little castle towers that represent other player's home realms, there is some variance to these towers which dot the landscape but because re-dressing your tower requires Cubits (the games in game currency) and quite a lot of them, it takes a very long time (or a cash expense) to change what yours looks like. You are also given a 'starter castle' plot which you may place in any of the small amount of remaining plots available to get your own bland castle on the landscape and your own home realm to manipulate. (I recommend you study your surroundings and position on the sky map before devoting your realm to a plot, as it can be easy to lose your home in the plethora of identical homes after you walk away from it. How the realms themselves work I did like however, you enter a realm anywhere on the map by literally 'jumping' into it. It reminds me a lot of the paintings in Mario 64, where each represented a different world you could jump into.  After placing, naming and jumping into your personal realm, you may or may not be disappointed to know that the overall aesthetic of your realm has absolutely nothing to do with where you placed it in the overworld. I, for example, placed my realm right next to a mountain mine (I'll talk about the mines later) as it contained many things that fit into my personal aesthetic view. So, to recap, I placed my home next to a mountain, on a tall area of land in the snowy frozen wasteland that is the northern end of Pelago. Thus, I expected my home to be A)Snowy or Icy and/or B)Somewhat mountainous. What I got instead was a nice summertime forest-y area that evidently is all that you get to start with. To my dismay, I also realized very quickly that this world was very tiny. It looks big to begin with, but the moment you try to build something of any scale (I love building castles, which is why I downloaded this game at all, I mean it's got bloody castles in the name!) you'll realize that your realm is actually quite limited, both in height (You can only dig so far down, or get enough resources to artificially build it up first) and it's x,y width. No sooner had I started building what was meant to be a mountain fortress than I realized that not only would my desired castle not fit, but the town I wanted to build outside would not either. This is 'easily' remedied in one of two ways, you can either A) Purchase a 'room' piece, which essentially lets you artificially expand your realm by having tiny realms within it or B) Purchase an entirely new and larger overworld realm (which does have the choice for winter/summer/tropical/etc starts by the way, so they could have let you choose to begin with, this irks me slightly) of course, even the smallest ones are a very large number of Cubits (that currency I brought up earlier) meaning that you either have to destroy your hands and worsen your carpal tunnel, or drop a fat stack of cash on the game in order to improve your realm size.  So, how exactly do you gain more Cubits if you're not inclined to buy them? Well, as advertised, each object in the game that you can remove from it's location has a very very small chance to drop exactly one. This wont seem so bad to begin with however, as you do seem to get the drops relatively often as you gather materials for your tiny home, or even as you change the land within your tiny home. But then you might be so inclined as to check the Cubit store, where your tiny little naked characters jaw will drop (Oh yeah, you start naked. Basic shirt and pants can be made, but everything else costs 250 Cubits+) for even the least expensive things available are upwards of 100 Cubits. So you may quickly discover that the only reliable way to gather cubits in any useful manner is to purchase a 'tip piggy' (These cost 500 Cubits by the way, so you'll be getting carpal tunnel just to afford one) and then have a home interesting enough for anyone to leave tips (laughable) or try to rope people into buying things that you have/can make and they can't/don't know how to make. For this reason, many people have taken to converting their entire realm into a virtual 'shop' where you can go to purchase various useful items for a handful of your hard-earned Cubits.   However, there is no actual trade system. 'Trading' in this game consists of (in the case of buying things) one player placing their Cubits in another player's tip piggy, followed by the 'selling' player, dropping the item you wanted to buy for you to pick up. This of course leads to quite a few problems.  1. You have no guarantee that the seller is not scamming you out of your cubits, only to ban you from their home immediately afterwards (Hasn't happened to me yet but I've seen a lot of people complain about it)  2. Any other passing player can then take your item off the ground before you do, and there's nothing you or the seller can do about it. (Which can host another scam I witnessed where the seller's friend grabs the item to give it back later)  3. In the case of Realm/Room items, there's no guarantee that you don't drop 1200 Cubits for a room of a certain size, or season, only for the seller to drop a 'closet' sized (the very cheapest one, you can buy them with 200 Cubits) 10x10 realm for you.  All of these things leave both buyers and sellers weary, as buyers become less likely to buy without the item first (they might steal it) and sellers have to go to great lengths to show themselves as a 'legitimate' seller. All because there's not even some semblance of a trading system implemented into the game. (Don't forget that just BUYING a tip piggy so that you can sell things and receive tips, costs you a cool 500 Cubits) I am largely convinced that these previous aspects of the game, combined with language barriers, create the next problem I've seen.   Everyone is anti-social as all hell. Some of the more popular rooms include; The room that teaches you how to make stuff (Careful trying to craft there, as people can steal your stuff while you're crafting), Shops, where so far I've met one person who can speak English fluently enough for transactions not to seem like I'm about to be stolen from:   The last interaction I had with a 'shop' keeper: 'So can I see the product before I give you 80 Cubits, so I know you're not trying to scam me?' '80 Cubits yes. Piggy.'   and rooms that purport to have some sort of activity to do, such as obstacle courses and jumpy rooms (Literally all you can make with the limited interactive blocks) or some combination of the two. Few people stay in any one of these places long before going AFK or leaving, many without saying a word. The few times you may be graced by the presence of a random visitor while in your home, they generally just jump around for a minute without saying anything and then leave, or beg for your things and then leave. One time I had someone ask if they could buy something, the only other person that spoke to me told me that my room (still under construction mind you) sucked while he played on my water spring before quitting.   I have now realized I'm like one sentence from the limit on this thing, so I can't even get to the rest of the stuff that's terrible about this game. It's just not worth your time.",

Its improvements are pretty neat, and new stuff are added like every month or even less. I have been playing Cubic Castles, since August, 31st of 2014, and spent 2,700 hours here on Steam so far, and most likely 500 hours from other devices and I'm not bored playing it at all. It may have some server disadvantages rarely, but the administrators of the game, get aware of any problem right away, so expect it will be fixed very soon. Well, another little disadvantage are scams. But if you learn to play safe, and follow some rules, you won't ever get scammed. So play safe, and you will enjoy it. It's worth playing it. 9.5/10 in my opinion, and I highly recommend Cubic Castles. Just give it a go and I'm sure you will be satisfied.",

The game constantly asks you to bring in more friends, even though it can't handle the server stress right now. Good Idea Dev's bring more people onto a server thats already showing signs of failure. Its also a Pay 2 Play. You want blocks, either use a mine until your fingers turn to dust or just take out your credit card. Need one more item to finish crafting, get out your credit card. Biomes make no sense aswell, from what I have gathered no matter what biome you are in it is the normal biome. The camera is always pointed down making basements, towers, caves, etc. impossible. Looking into a pit is even to hard to do. The stuff shown in the pictures of the store page are basically when you have mined for a million hours and your hands are gone or spending atleast 50$ on this game. The crafting system makes no sense. (You put items in randomly and look for the thing you want to craft.) Also lets say you make the mistake of you want friends to build and you set it to everyone. Your plot of land will be gone just the most bottom layer is left. You know whats a better game than this but still similar Minecraft. Not saying I love that game it just that everything in Minecraft is better than this game.  Overall 2/10 for almost making me lose a finger trying to setup a small 4X3 house.",

The problems with this game are big and obvious, but it's a good game overall. The main problems I have seen is that there are way to many scammers, and people abuse the report ability. Also when you report someone who actually robbed/scammed/trolled you, the moderators/cosmic cow staff do nothing. The daily quests also get ridiculous. Something like mine 50+ gold is not worth 50 in-game currency. Even though the problems are frustrating, numerous, and annoying, and ignoring the fact that the game lacks replayability, I would recommend this game to anyone who likes sandbox building games and multiplayer games.",

If you finaly buy one of the cubic packs, you have your fun untill it runs out.

Im not saying its a brilliant game, but its not really as bad as many people say, you should give it a shot at least. However, I do seem to get kicked out of server probably 20 times every 3 minutes I dont know why, but I do. So maybe thats a bug or maybe just my internet connection (&lt;most likely XD).",

While its a good game again but it gets annoying later on because its like 1st time you join your like 'Oh cool! this is awesome!' but once you talk to pepole and get more into the game its like 'Whats this again?' Witch is bad for a game but this just goes like 'sit your ●●●● down im going to teach you a lesson. You learn this NOW and deal with it'    ●3● This is a bad thing.. LOTS OF TROLLERS! i had a butiful shop making a income of about 100 cubits... But this guy said 'I can make it alot better if you give me building premission!' So like me i was like 'k' So i let him do it and i left. X.X when i saw my world. evreything look liked it hit a bomb. all my income was gone. i feel bad for myself i was kinda okay with it because i shoulve been lazy but THIS?!?!?!?!?!??!?!? I MEAN GOSH anyways lets move on      ● I randomly lost my count ● Another bad thing The abilty to NOT turn of hollas, Hollas are a way of messaging all players in game even if you hate the person. Evreyone uses it for trades and stuff but to me its annoying as me with the flu.. 'PET FOR 300 CUBITS AND A FREE ____' its really annoying. Trust me you CANT turn it off i have not found a way yet. While this is a free game this isint an issue but its going to have to change..    ●4● The worst thing: Losing your account. One time i lost my account because (on the game) THE GAME DIDINT SAVE MY ACCOUNT USERNAME AND PASSWORD FOR SOME RANDOM REASON! usally it will let me log in easy but nope 1 YEAR LATER (or 2) i finnaly found my account name (you need to use your user name to get in) I found my account name on my account on my OLD REVIEW thank god for my 7-18 year old life!       Sins:3 Non-Sins:2-ish How i predict the game will end its popular run: Evreyone gets trolled and evreyone gets tired of it.

I'm sorry but that is a very poor excuse for not making the realms blockable to others. What does this teach our children...that stealing is ok if they can get away with it. I am sorry I cannot advocate such a game, ********************************************************************************************************************  I am surprised at this game. First it's free to play, not free to pay or pay to win. It has some distinct similarities to a certain mining game (which I own). It does have it's problems but when you suddenly get a mass influx of new users than things will probably break. I currently have over 16 hours in this game and am enjoying it. Don't let some of the negative reviews color your decision about whether to try it or not...give it a try your self. The download is small so give it a try. A note about the in-game store....I have currently found very few items that would require me to spend any of the cubits (in game currency) I  have found while gathering resources to craft various items. And so far I can craft pretty much everything I want. I'm saving my cubits for getting additions to my initial plot/building area. I might also get a little vain and get a skin for my plot (what my plot looks like outside). Like that other game (minecraft) this has a learning curve and will take time to develop you homestead if you do not want to throw (RL) money at it to get things fast. If you are teetering on the edge....read through the forum...look for the Dev's responses. They are active in the community which is more I can say for some of the games I have actually invested money in. OK, now that I have said all that...yes the game currently has connection issues and (soon to be fixed) realm decay issues. Neither of these are a game breaker. Irritating Yes but otherwise expected. It's new to the PC, It's Multiplayer. If you have ever played a game like World of Warcraft or something similar you might say they run great....I say you were probably not a player when the game came out because most if not all MP(Multiplayer) games have had similar issues in some form. Again try it yourself, don't allow negative critics of the game push you away from something you may find really enjoyable.",

Most of the people in the thread have said 'How about just making it so we can LOCK them, or close out people who are not on our friends list. Funny thing it took about the entire time I played to come up with 100 of those money things they use. The other option the dev offered was basically this...don't play if you don't like it.

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg. 2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla. 3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat. 4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed 5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed. 6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.

            "review_text": "I'm being completely honest, not funny or terribly serious, so take this as you will. Cubic Castles is a better choice of the many Free to Play MMOs, but it has many things that rightfully turn serious MMO players away. The first of which being that this game is very light on RPG elements. There is a level system, and experience toward each next level is earned through small daily quests which usually involve mining for blocks and materials, or crafting certain items. With each new level up comes a perk to add to your character that improves your abilities slightly. That's... it. Second reason is that you have no real goal, just do as you like. As any good sandbox game should have, you are given a starting world or 'Realm' to customize with any blocks you have and make it your own. However, ever since this game started on Steam the population of this game became extremely crowded and it's hardly possible to make your Realm accessible because there's ♥♥♥♥ing castles everywhere in the overworld. So there is the potential possibility of not being able to access your own Realm at all if you were to start fresh within the couple months. Lastly, this game is full of KIDS. Hundreds of thousands of kids. It wasn't when I first started this game when it launched on Steam. With all these kids comes many bad encounters if your focus in this game to build cool Realms or host your own store, you may have a tough time. You can easily be scammed. Thankfully over the many months this game has been alive, the developers have made transactions and trades between players much more safe. Now, if you can look past these three main things, you may have a decent time playing Cubic Castles! Mining for materials isn't too bad, building is simple, crafting is smart and fairly complex, and there's always some entertaining things being said in the global chat. Although most people don't realize they're throwing away the in game currency every time they write 'Hi :3' in the global chat, you have every right to point and laugh. Whether you wanna explore, build up a huge wealth, create obstacle courses, or run your own store, there's something for everyone. Just be friendly and take passion in your work. Now then, I'll let you know that my partner Mario! and myself, Luigi!, are building a Super Mario Bros. themed obstacle course. It's still in constuction but will be done soon, so if you find us around in the near future, be sure to check it out.",

            "review_text": "had fun playing this until I was done building, then it was pretty much boredom from there - until I caved and purchased bigger space.  I liked: - Customising my base with a wide variety of blocks, plants, furniture etc - The platform games that challenge you (or you can make your own!) - You don't need to constantly make and remake tools for mining  What I didn't like: - Microtransaction currency: while supporting a game you enjoy is a good thing, it gets excessive when you have to pay for everything other than basic furnishings and basic blocks because the cost for items is so high.   - Your realm decays, meaning even if you did contribute some of your hard earned cash and forgot to log in once in a while - whoops, its gone. You get an email warning you, but if you're anything like me and put that to the bottom of your priority list or change emails... I find it kind of cruel and bad business.  - Hollas: chat announcements which spam up the chat usually with pointless drama or ridiculous sales/scams and give an unfair sales advantage to people who have been in the game longer and can afford them (they cost more than a land expansion!) You pretty much need a guaranteed sale of 500 to break even, never mind profit )considering you get one cubit per 10-20 blocks mined that is a lot!) Sales are difficult for new players because as a beginner, anything you can mine or craft anyone else can and thus usually not interested in purchasing.  - Retired items (a pet peeve of mine; as if being new to a game isn't harsh enough!)  - Toxic community: scams are frequent (though hopefully if you play you'll be smart enough to see right through them) a lot of people are snobbish 'elitists' or immature; labelling others as scammers or 'ragequitting' when they don't get what they want, excessively rude and occasionally deliberately swiping your materials and currency you mined (they can't touch your base though on the right settings - if you set up a farm there it helps.) Not forgetting to mention everyone spams a friend request without so much as saying hello and never, ever doing so either. It gets frustrating between people who speak other languages on the same server and people who talk in leet speak, irritating with people begging - there's even a 'tip piggy' you can place to ask for money!  - The dehydrated cubes although fun to find out what surprise is inside, they are rare to find and have silly long real time 'rehydration' hours - lowest one is four hours, longest is one week. After waiting so long... you get a piece of crap you could have mined or crafted yourself in 0.000001 of the time you waited... &gt;:(  - Limited to one character, so if you pick the wrong irreversable perk when levelling it sucks to be you!",

            "review_text": "This game is a joy to me mostly because I like Mine Craft and this game matches Mine Craft except there are no pixels and you view your character in bird's eye view. There are positive and negatives to the game for one, the tutorial is not very helpful and the Town Center doesn't really help with crafting too much. Most players are pretty rude and make you kill yourself in the game which is irritating. The positive things about the game are the art and creativity you can put into the game.",
