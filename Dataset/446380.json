            "review_text": "Okay, so it's scary. REALLY scary. Fantastic atmosphere, both visually and aurally...very tense...but is it LOGICAL?!    Firstly, there's the usual 'you've been given a really, really super-dangerous job for next-to-no pay' premise...so in spite of them never clearly stating as such, I'm assuming that all of these post-FNAF games are set in third world countries, where life is cheap and you'd basically murder your grandmother for spare change. I mean, I accepted the premise of the first Five Nights at Freddy's as much as anyone, but the sixtieth time around this kind of set-up is pushing its luck just a tad, don't ya think?     Secondly, I do everything the game tells me to. Run here to stop generator A, B, C, or D from running down, solve (admittedly well-done) mini-puzzles at the laptop when required, and try my best to hang around in the designated 'safe-spot' for the rest of the time (quite how the laptop knows the exact place in the house to stand to avoid ghostly victimisation I have no fricking idea, but I'm happy enough to accept that I know ♥♥♥♥-all about modern technological capabilities). And STILL I die, again and again and again. I don't know WHY I do, but I do. There's a bit in the game's instructions which says something about Sophie occasionally attacking because she simply 'doesn't like you'. Well, apparently she ♥♥♥♥ing HATED ME, because she assailed me left, right, and centre. No reprieve. No logic. Just sudden, random, rampant doom.     Don't get me wrong, I actually quite liked this one. There's something at least slightly more assured about it than the likes of, say, Emily Wants to Play. But I'm getting a bit sick of this recent run of horror games where sheer, dumb-arsed LUCK seems to play such a large part in how long you survive before the next fatal 'jump-scare' comes your way. I'm sure a plethora of fan-boys and fan-girls will slap up guides in no time, telling me what you have to do at each and every different hour and blah-blah-blah, but unless I can actually work this ♥♥♥♥ out for myself, it's not exactly LOGICAL, is it now?     I honestly look forward to all you people proving me wrong, at which point I'll revise this review and the below-given rating. Please, tell me how my faculties are flawed, and by that I don't mean write ♥♥♥♥ like 'dude, everyone knows that 11pm is the time when Sophie attacks you if you hang around too long at generator C', because unless the game clearly tells me this, IT ISN'T LOGICAL. Please, thumb me down and tell me I'm wrong, but also tell me WHY I'm wrong. Hell, even the first FNAF plays reasonably fair for at least the first few nights, but this game gave me almost no delusion of 'control' over my fate whatsoever.     I've played a LOT of horror games in my time. And almost all the 'old' ones - I'm even talking up to Outlast and Alien: Isolation here! - give you sufficient indication of what you have to do to survive, then the rest is up to you. This super-recent, post-FNAF breed of game seems to believe that '♥♥♥♥ happens' can pass for good game design. I beg to differ. Having said all this, I think the dev of this game shows tremendous potential, he just needs to emulate a better - nay, FAIRER - kind of game in future.    This is far from the worst of its species, but it's also not the best, and until someone (including Scott Cawthon himself) makes a game as good as Freddy's the first, we really should just put a cork in all games of this type for the time being, whad'ya say? (Or failing that, ♥♥♥♥wits like me could just stop buying them, haha.) Looking forward to that veritable assault of 'tips' from all you super-savvy fan-persons out there...   Verdict: 6.5/10.  UPDATE: Well, here we are a bit over a month later, and credit where credit is due...this dev has laboured long and hard to give the gaming public a much improved experience. And, I'm pleased to say, he's MOSTLY succeeded. We now have two difficulty levels - though the easier of the two is still much too hard in my humble opinion - and while the 'random' death element has been ostensibly removed, and 'cheap' deaths are far less common, I still can't help but feel that there are moments when you're damned-if-you-do-and-damned-if-you-don't, and I certainly still feel that save-points are too few and far between (once every hour would be more than challenging enough, especially for the allegedly 'easy' version of the game). Whichever way you look at it, I'm happy to concede that this is by far one of the best games of its type - i.e. the some-strategy/some-luck/jumpscare-game-with-minimal-mechanics sub-genre - though it would appear that the first Five Nights at Freddy's is destined to remain the king of its kind. As with that game, however, I'm probably destined to never find the nerve and/or patience to fully 'beat' this one, but in light of the dev's improvements I'm more than happy to adjust my rating to read (drum roll, please):  REVISED VERDICT: 7.5/10.  SECOND UPDATE: Well, I gotta hand it to Eddie the dev...after the initial doubts of myself and many other reviewers, he's worked long and hard at this little game of his, and he's finally managed to make it fair to the point where even the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ likes of yours truly can now complete the darned thing (granted, on the easiest difficulty)! I'm now willing to go on record and state that this is, in my opinion, a rival for the second-best game of its type, after the first Five Nights at Freddy's. Congrats, sir, and I hope you get some kind of Dev of the Year award for this commendable effort. ♥♥♥♥ing good game...finally.   RE-REVISED VERDICT: 9/10 (by far the biggest score hike I've given a game...EVER).",

            "review_text": " UPDATE  I've changed my negative review to a positive one on account of the developer making such a focused effort to respond to my criticisms of the game outlined in my original review below.  The random deaths, which were the one very major issue I had with  Sophie's Curse , are no longer in the game. Some people are disappointed with that but, personally, I don't see what joy there is to be gained from failing for absolutely no reason, especially in a title where the action is spread relatively thin in the early stages.  The 'jumpscare simulator' will never be a favourite sub-genre for me but, with the issues addressed, this is about as solid an example of one as you can hope to find on Steam.  =======================================================  Original Review  Sorry to be the lone voice of dissent here but... no. Not while we're rating this as an actual playable game.  The premise is simple enough. You've got four lights to keep on, two upstairs and two downstairs, while avoiding the titular ghoul Sophie who will sneak, scuttle and slither around behind you at all times, looking for the perfect moment to grab your face and howl at it with a decibel count to rival most mid-40's war artillery.   The problem is that there's no rhyme or reason as to when she can murder you and when she can't. You're assigned a safe point at the start of the game that changes around between checkpoints but it's about as much use as nipples on a tank. By the developer's own admission, and I quote:   'If Sophie doesn’t like you she might kill you randomly but this is very very rare, I hope she likes you!'   Except it's really not that rare. In fact, it's the most common way you'll die. At what point has randomised death ever been acceptable? Imagine trotting through Super Mario Bros and just bloody dying of an aneurysm. Imagine fighting Dr. Wily in Mega Man and spontaneously combusting because he just 'doesn't like you'. It's even more tedious here, in a game where you spend the majority of your time sitting around waiting for the clock to roll over a two hour increment while the lights slowly dwindle, daring you to expose yourself out of boredom rather than necessity.  It works as an app that you can leave running in the background to scare the ♥♥♥♥ out of you at completely random intervals, maybe like those maze games that walloped Linda Blair's demon face from The Exorcist at you with an ear-splitting shriek as a surprise bowel evacuator. Nothing more.  Here's what I got out of it:         YouTube™ Video:  Let's Slay... SOPHIE'S CURSE (PC/2016)&nbsp;",

As the nurse, you must take care of an elder who just recently purchased a new house. This new house being the one Sophie haunts. To survive, you must manually keep the light sources active by exploring the house to crank the generators individually.   Backstory  Sophie was a young and average teenage girl with a great GPA. But out of nowhere, she went missing.   Gameplay  Not the best graphics, but that doesn't really matter. The concept is pretty nice. It differs from what seems to be similar to the FNaF franchise according to the community's responses. The AI of Sophie isn't bugged or anything. The game carries in a lot of scares. Through and through, the game is pretty well done.   Pros  - Spooky - Challenging   Cons  - Long nights  Through and through, I'd recommend this game to people who are interested in horror games.",
