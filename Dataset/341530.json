            "review_text": "This game is awesome. The developer managed to create a game with simple and limited mechanics that is SUPER FUN to play. It is impressive how such a simple game can be so good.  + Pros: + Beautiful pixel art; + Gundams! + Fast-paced-1-shot-death gameplay; + Bullet reflection through sword swing at right timing; + Balanced, because it is only skill-based; + Limited ammo and ally droids forces you to use you sword frequently;  - Cons: - No online multiplayer (PLEASE CODE THIS, DEVELOPERS! I know fast-paced games usually present problems about online gaming, but the users still need it!);  I certainly recommend this! It is an awesome game and it is definetely better with your couch party friends. It is not so good alone, but it is still pretty fun.",

I can imagine it being especially popular at parties and whatnot considering the lower difficulties offer players of any skill-level a chance of winning.
