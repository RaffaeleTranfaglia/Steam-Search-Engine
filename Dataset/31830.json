And I'm glad that I did. It isn't the perfect game, but it is good. Some of the puzzles weren't exactly logical and you might need to guess until you get it right or look at a guide to figure it out. I'm sure some people will scoff at the idea of playing a Nancy Drew game, but I'd say you should look past that.  I haven't played any of the other Nancy Drew games, but I'd consider picking more of them up at the right price. I'd recommend picking it up at 75% off or maybe in a bundle that would offer the games at less than a dollar each.  I will update this review to be more in-depth at a later time.",

The time mechanic made it tedious to progress, while the timed challenges did not add to the difficulty of the task, but did add to the frustration. The dark hallways served no purpose, except to throw you off in what direction you were going. The most important item in the game (The Silent Book) you could not take with you, meaning that you either had to document it yourself (like I did), or backtrack a million times. The ending left me highly unsatisfied. The amount of work put into the challenges, versus the satisfaction one feels from completing them, was not symbiotic. Some of the games were left to pure chance with minimal amount of stategy.",
