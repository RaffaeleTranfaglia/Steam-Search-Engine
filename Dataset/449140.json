    "description": "In Istrolid you design your own unique spaceships from a large number of parts to fit your strategy and play style. With no set units or factions you are free to create a fleet where each ship has its own balanced strengths and weaknesses, from basic fighters and bombers to hulking battleships and speedy destroyers.",

Here's a list of my pros and cons:  Pros: +Extensive Campaign where you feel like you definitely are progressing +You can program your own AI for your fleet and let them fight for you! +Building whatever type of spacecraft you desire +Limitless combinations +Every weapon and part seems to have a place where it shines, and also can be countered +Multiplayer +Ability to save many of your designs on a little spreadsheet +Completely free +No micro-transactions at all  Cons: -A cap to how large you can build your spacecraft (but this is most likely here for a reason) -Sometimes laggy during multiplayer (only 3-4 games out of the several games I've played)",

All the mechanics are balanced and there is NOT one way to win. Defeating the AI's in the Campiagn mode was challenging but rewarding.  I haven't completed the campiagn yet but moved on to multiplayer this is where I began to run into issues with the game. One of the biggest problems I had was the copying feature. This is good for new players however you would think it to be etiquette to change the designs and not just use the copyied ones but some players don't do this. Another issue I have is the lack of 2v2 and 3v3 servers today there were only two 3v3 servers but one crashed and there was only one 2v2 and one 3v3. For me this is one of the biggest problems with the game since I rarely play 1v1 and mostly 3v3   Apart from this it is one of the best free strategy games in its genre.",

All games are on dedicated 'servers', of which there are only so many available, many of which have hosts idle for hours at a time, rendering them useless. what matchmaking does is automatically put you on a server with someone else on it, but this usually ends is A) being kicked by someone waiting for a friend due to the lack of private games, B) being kicked by someone for being too low / too hogh ranked, or C) getting stuck with one of the aforementioned idle hosts. this is a great game, but the difficulty in getting to play it leaves it one of the least played games in my library.",

I'm waiting for more content like new parts, maps, gamemodes and maybe something like posibility of building an extremely big spaceship.

Missions are challenging and there are a vast assortment of modifications to adapt to every new challenge.   There's a minimum of at least 4-6 hours in campaign for people to enjoy. Multiplayer is fun also with very little lag although lag does occur that may simply be from peer to peer and not the server itself.   Surprised they're able to run this game without any apparent source of income so bravo to the team that did this. Istrolid is definitely a gem amongst indie games.",

Tactics can change on the battleground and so do the ships if a player decides to counter his enemy. Are they spamming missiles? Point defense them to hell. Are they spamming nukes? Build giant block monster that pull in enemies. Maybe for fun, cloak some tesla drones for an ambush. I would easily pay money for this game. Everyone who reads this, fall in love with the mayhem.",

I was expecting somthing that was kinda in the betas/alphas and didnt have much of a feel for it, Basicly nothing like reassembly.  I was wrong to ♥♥♥♥.  Its a damn good game and is like reassembly with its amazing ship building with next to no limits, Exept a small exaust limit and a 1000$ limit, Which is fine.  Before i made a silly review that showed no real review at all, So i hope this helps.  My rating out of 100 is 99.5, Because they didnt charge money for it. And they damn well deserve it. But they do with the expansion so its 100/100 for me, Keep developing it.",

Balance a fleet of fighters, Anti-missile, artilary, cruisers, dreadnaughts, anything in between and more as you design each ship yourself. What truely sets it apart is the ability to give ships their own ai. Not only design each ship, but design how it fights allowing you to focus on other things.  Pros: -Very open but balanced ship creation,  -Every item has pros and cons that actually carry meaningful weight. -Plenty of players and lobbies -Infinite strategies to try -Easy ai design for the less programming savvy -Simple, but attractive graphics -Simple gameplay that allows simple to advanced strategies for all players. -Can play against dozens of unique AI fleets instead of other players. -Can play with teams upto 3, can be mixed with AI as well.   Cons: -Nothing forces a player to finish a game, making some matches anti-climatic. -Slighty buggy here and there, nothing game breaking. -Over simplified ai design hinders those who want more depth in their ai. -Map backgrounds are simple and a little bare. -One game type. -your statistics aren't tracked for online play. -The only restriction in ship creation is that it has to costs under $1000.   How a Match looks like: You start with $2000 to spawn the ships you want(or let the ai you made do that). Your goal is to capture every point on the map. Over time each point you own gives you more money to buy more ships. Mix defensive giants, small fighters, long range beams, artillary, lasers, support ships, and others to over come your opponent and capture the points. It can be very fast paced, or slowed paced depending on strategies. Ive had half hour matches, and others that lasted a few seconds.   Overall: 9/10  Simple but diverse game that leaves you tweaking your strategies for hours. The few minor nitpicks should not stop you from trying the game out.",

Istrolid is a Spaceship building simulator where you create spaceships in a customization menu, set up different spaceship troop setups, and then fight against an AI, 1 person, or multiple people on online servers in a king of the hill type arena with randomely generated maps every time.   With each ship you have to manage things like energy, energy consumption, speed, turning speed, and more while staying under a budget maximum of 1000 per ship. One unique feature I thought was cool was that the parts you use are completely free, but it only costs you when you go into battle. The more money spent, the stronger and more useful it (Likely) is, but it will eat up cash faster.    If you dont want to practice with another player, then there are tons of bots to fight against each with a different tactic (Mine being attaching bombs to fast ships and then spawning 50 of them since they are so cheap to buy).   Another thing, this game is free. Not free to play, FREE. As in no microtransactions.   All I can say is if your into massive customization or RTS's, this might be the game for you.",

Plus, the ship-building has little constraints, so even with a few parts, you can build a lot of different ships.  Though, some things I found where a bit lacking are 1. Difficulty of the singleplayer campaign could be tweaked a bit. Some are can be a bit frustraiting with enemy ships that are much better than yours, and others can be beaten literally within ten seconds by spamming dozens of tiny 50$ fighters. 2. Fighting the AI can be a bit annoying, because they are so much more manuverable. Currently, the only command you can do is setting a 'rally point' where ships will go to when created, and telling a ship to move to a certain place. Your ships follow your directions to the letter, and won't even defend itself while moving if a enemy ship is following it from the back and shooting it to peices.  Moving your ships to more than one place at a time is more or less imposible. Dodging enemy fire or manuvering around them is only possible if you neglect your other ships.  The enemy? They easily move multiple ships to multiple places with ease. While you're telling each ship to go to each 'capture point' individually, the enemy will already have spawned ships that move to said points the moment they are made. Enemy ships will chose to run or fight your ships, and the light, speedy ships will run circles around your ships while they spin in place trying to hit the half-dozen tiny ships making loops everywhere. If you try to do this, you'll most likely lose all the ships. Enemy (non-combat)ships can hover around your ships and stay out of the range of your guns(or try anyways). Your ships will happily sit and get blown to peices by artillery if you don't tell them to move  An AI for your ships to tell them to run/fight/doge/etc would be nice.",

But as you progress you will unlock new ones to aid you in battle. In multipalyer you fight other people and their fleets. All parts are unlocked and you can build whaterver you want. The battles can be 1v1 or team based. The building of the ships is very well done as you are given many different parts for different types of ships. This allows for a wide array of varying playstyles and adds to replayability. If you want you can even give your ships an custom A.I so you don't have to worry about micromanaging your fleet.
