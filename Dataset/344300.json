            "review_text": "aliens blew up your planet? don't get all Dented up! go forth to the alien worlds and make them pay. make them ALL pay.  basically, this is an arena shooter fought in a circular space. levels alternate between gathering salvage in Asteroids-style gameplay, and jacking up mass quantities of enemy planetary defensive craft long enough to get in nice and close and drop your Heckabomb on said planet to make it explode into lovely, lovely bursts of pretty sparkly bits,  along the way, you'll get to deal with levels involving alien saucer attacks (great for salvage!), enemy ace pilots, and huge warships that join in trying to keep their planet in a nice unexplodey state.   every level completed grants you an extra continue, which basically is an extra life that resets your ship to the state it had at the start of the level -- but the level itself will not be identical to the one just played. especially in planet levels, this could mean you get a much easier or much harder try than the previous one.   the game's got a pretty nice ship upgrade system and six special weapons that can be purchased (and themselves upgraded) . it oozes style in every way (I adore the main menu with its shifting viewpoints of planets and suns!) from the graphic design to the excellent, pulse-pounding music. all in all, it's an excellent, well-crafted shmup experience.  it can get kind of crazy in higher levels (40+), when aliens or asteroids begin to pile up in huge numbers that can be nearly impossible to fend off.   words to the wise AI: do NOT be within 4 to 5 ship-lengths of an asteroid when it blows up. two chunks of rock come racing out at high speed and while they're at this speed, can take off 2 or more shields at once. I got instakilled a bunch before I realized what was going on.",

            "review_text": "  Its a decent game, and I've certainly played worse. However, I'm not going to recommend it for several reasons:  -Horrid main menu controls. -Unresponsive aim which takes way too long to change angles, and its something crucial in these kind of games. -Very little amount of content. -There are much better and much more solid games here on steam even cheaper than the 6$ this game asks you for. -When I was about to write a review, I noticed on the right side there were a bunch of bots recommending the game. If it's not the devs, then I don't know who it could be, but it's disgusting anyways.",
