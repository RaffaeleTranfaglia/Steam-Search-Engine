    "description": "In Tokyo’s popular ”Electric Town” district, Akihabara, vampires called “Synthisters” walk among us. You must identify and dispose of them the only way you know how – by engaging them in hand-to-hand combat in order to strip them of their clothes so their bodies melt away in the sunlight.",

Brilliant. If you happen to fight a human instead, at least they'll survive the encounter, somewhat embarrassed.  It's got a bit of a short story, but there's multiple endings and a bunch of stuff to unlock. And you can just put the main questlines on hold to roam around a bit and do sidequests. Story is conveyed through a bit of VN style dialogues, and missions usually consist of fighting. You can collect outfits, accessories, flyers, even a few walking styles and some other stuff.  Recommended to play with gamepad. Around the middle of the game, the street can get filled up with enemies to fight, some just jump in when they see you fighting someone, so combat's pretty much all over the place. The camera locks near the exit of locations to highlight it. This can also happen mid combat, which can be a bit annoying.  All'n all, it's not the best of ports, but the game itself is quite amusing.",

            "review_text": "Hahahaha... Played this game like I had no tomorrow.. I really need to get a life....             Now lets get serious. [contains minor spoiler alert]  Concept: Unique. Real Unique. I would have never thought of Vampire related game that involves stripping people (lol) but I think it is fresh and very well thought of.  Story &amp; Missions: I loved it. I think the story is very good through out the play. I just wish there was Kati's True End and REAL Sister's Route (SISCON ALERT) If you are playing this multiple times the first 25% of the missions feels repetitive. Side missions are very good and not boring *FEW OF THEM ARE PRETTY HARD* *I ALSO EXPECTED THERE TO BE SECRET END WITH MALE NPC WHEN YOU DON'T CHOOSE ANY ROUTE BUT THERE'S NONE. JUST SAYING.*  Bosses: Ah... They are way to easy. Really easy even on Hardest difficulty. when you and your gal gets maxed out weapons and do unison attack, the bosses are piece of cake. (HOLY ♥♥♥♥ THEY ARE EASIER THAN SOME MOBS)  Weapons and Customizations: Fantastic. Lots of ways to customize you and you can even customize NPCs which I love the most about this game! A lot of weapons can be used too! Only problem with weapons I would choose is that on Hardest Difficulty, you don't get to pick much other weapons since you sorta need weapons with high speed and wide attack radius and range which makes Heavy weapons garbage..(I loved them and only used them on first play through)  Combat System: It is pretty okay considering if you are average (have fun) player but if you are hardcore gamer (UNLOCK ALL THINGS AND BECOME GOD TIER IN EVERYGAME POSSIBLE), the combat system becomes quite annoying later on. The A.I. Dodging is real pain in the ♥♥♥ when you play this game with HARDEST difficulty. (They mind read you and dodge most of your attacks BUT WELL I GUESS THAT IS WHY IT IS HARDEST DIFFICULTY) It is easy 1vs1 or 1vs2 (yeah including your partner) but when it becomes 1 vs Multiple enemies, it feels like your Partner doesn't do much...  It gets annoying when they can dodge most of your attacks and you don't even get to dodge while getting hit by them.Unless you block the first attack from the enemy it is almost impossible to dodge next attacks since you become *Struggled* (there is even Record for how many time you press buttons when you are in *Struggled* status) **This excludes when enemy is using slow two handed weapons or heavy weapons. One of the problems is that the counter attacks seem iffy sometimes because they don't even hit when enemies get into attack motion while you are counter attacking. Another problem would be targeting. When you are fighting against multiple enemies you cannot target lock on one target and it keeps switching targets. Wish you could use R2 or L2 buttons to switch targets!  Well the combat review was just me QQing and whining about the things that I found hard... so don't take it seriously because I still had fun and still having fun playing this game on Hardest difficulty! :D   Overall I love this game and I enjoy playing it!    btw if you wanna have real challenge play this game on Hardest difficulty taking Shion's Route while doing all Side missions &amp; Battle Arena and doing secret sister route all at the same time",

            "review_text": "I recommend this game to people who like games mostly for story and having fun combat wise. Also people who like anime and waifus.   The story is actually very interesting. In the beginning you are an otaku who just wanted a job so you can get figures. But turns out the whole job thing was not as you thought it was… That's all I can say about the beginning without it being too ‘spoiler-ie’ The story as you hear in the trailer is about a boy, girl, duo who run round the streets of akiba and rip people's clothes off. So as you might of guessed the story is about you and a girl ripping people's clothing off, why? Well you would have to play to find out. And so you and the girl fight to clean the city of some tribal people. By ripping people's clothing off. The story opens up for the gameplay to make sense and it's actually really cool!  Some of the side quests are funny and fun too. &lt;--- Thats rare in games It's fun to rip off characters clothing. Annnnnd with the story their are multiple endings!!! A few of those endings brought tears to my eyes.   The gameplay is very good and has some nice unique mechanics. However, I don't want to say something bad but I have to be honest about it. The game some times can be VERY VERY annoying during combat. Like when an enemy rips off your cloths and you the characters stumble to somewhere else as in the animation. However your character when you go back to controlling it doesn't always go where the animation ended. And when you are knocked down some times the game doesn't give you much of a chance to get up or move just after you already got one piece of clothing striped off of you.  Despit this is still highly recommend the game to people who like anime and waifus.   The game also didn’t let me alt tab out or else it would crash and sometimes when I closed the game it black screened for a few seconds. (I use windows 10 btw) Fighting is a little difficult to grasp at first. I do not recommend for a first time player that you go on ‘gamer’ go for ‘easy’ or ‘casual.’  Also if you do struggle with the game, like I did the first time and went straight to ‘Gamer’ Then go to another difficulty. However you cannot change difficulty mid game so I lost all my data and started again. But those who are in it more for the story just go to ‘easy.’ It's still fun even then.",

While the PC version lacks some features from the PlayStation 4 version; the PC version runs great. It's a little choppy at times, but if you can forgive the engine's quirks, the dialogue is funny. Unfortunately, the English dub ruins the experience, but the original Japanese is the way to go. Also, Shizuku is waifu material.  Overall, it's a fun and quirky experience. Remember to save after major events and use Casual difficulty. Worth the buy for the price tag!",

I recommend when you start play fisrst choice gamer difficulty, because the game is easy.   The character drawings is excellent, and the 3D's cellshaded design is acceptable(need some tweaks for aliasing and colors). Sounds and music is realy good (but some fighting bgm is very annoying).

It includes 4 romance routes for Shizuku, Rin, Tohko and Shion (true and normal ones), +optional good ending for little sister. Characters are as deep as a cardboard cutout, but writing is done well. Some endings are better written than the others, though. This game took me about 50 hrs to finish all routes (the most hours I poured into a single game this year), grinding obviously wore off at the end and my gear was all maxed out (which you carry over for NG+ and so on)  Pros: real fun action, immersive otaku feels, cliche but fun and relatable characters, sweet endings Cons: grinding as an Exp source is exhausted halfway through the routes (Took me 2 routes to max out, never re-did the sidequests), cardboard characters, Shion's route in particular feels sketchy and rushed (but has best action)  Sum: Fun game, you should play it.

            "review_text": "I personally love this game, I dont really agree with the reviews online however. A lot of places just call this game a mediocre game with a fairly shallow combat system. But the charm of the game comes if you are familiar with Otaku culture. Im not saying you need to be familiar with it to enjoy the game, but for the most part you should know at least a little bit about otaku culture to enjoy it that much more.  The Combat is meh, but I enjoy it, it's simple but at the same time has some challenge to it. The real reason is for how much it praises/parodies otaku culture, and kind of makes fun of all the fan service in anime (At least that's how i see it since the game is like 90% fan service)  The game is hit and miss on how well it runs however, for example, my old computer was able to run it perfectly fine, but then I upgraded my computer and it just stopped working. I had to set it to run as admin and be in compatibility mode. Some report crashes frequently, slowdowns, and a black screen after the Xseed logo. Check the discussions if you want more info on all that. It is locked to 30 fps if that bnothers you (It's not bad for me since I grew up on consoles) I only have a few problems with it. First, the enemies can all stun lock you when theres a group of them, which is especially bad on the gamer and otaku difficulties. Second there's no vibration setting for the cfontrollers, which I feel a controller is much needed for this game, but the vibration goes off about 80% of the time when getting hit, and you get hit a lot in this game. Third, I dont like how there is no graphics options whatsoever, only a 'Max npc on screen' and 'Max npc shadow in distance' setings, unless you have to dig, which I didnt do, because it runs perfectly fine where it's at.  Overall Id say wait for a sale if you think the technical issues will be a problem, or until it gets fixed, but it's definitely worth a playthrough.",

Its super tight with a bunch of customisable animations through the use of different weapons, and you get rewarded for combos with 'chain strips.'   the visual novel part of the game is why you play past the first playthrough and is a really good way of intergrating NewGame+ because you can start again ala newgame+, to go through a different route meaning it is easier due to your gear which you upgrade over time (or harder if you crank up the difficulty and this game can get real hard), while the story doesn't really change from what I have seen so far on different routes ( as of writing I have played 2 seperate routes) the game really makes you feel the emotion of the characters and you really feel them grow with you depending on the route   **SPOILERS**      you could have one girl become like you and literaly become a vampire so that you and here are the equals like you have always been (BTW you turn into a vampire) or you can convince a girl you like to stay with you instead of leaving a little bit of a difference between them scale wise but it all makes sense when you play them.      **SPOILERS END**     Cough.. what did I say about emotion nah ♥♥♥♥ that I ment dank CG's. that all can be set as your phones background picture. So yes you can strip your companions and have that as your phone background.  Also I don't normaly like ads in games but these ones add a theme to the game you never really notice them (apart from the loading screen ads but they are in japanese and normaly look sweet as heck so who cares) but in the town of akiba there are screens playing ads for real life anime and what not constantly and it really adds to the atmosphere that you are in akiba. I aint been threre my self but I think I have watched enough anime to have a grasp on how it would be /s.    Just in case you didn't know /s means I am trying to convey sarcasim in text     But all of this aside the main game, 1 playthrough will take around 10-12 hours unless you are sick good at these sorts of action RPGs and/or literaly don't give af about the story and skip it all. subsequent playthroughs will take a few hours tops unless you crank up the difficulty. Also if I had to recomend play on easy/casual on a first playthrough because learning how to play the game whilst getting one shot was not fun.  If I had to rate it would be 9/10. amazing story, amazing gameplay and overall great theme.  Why no 10? cos nothing should ever get a ten its not the best game ever, but in my eyes its damn close. (also 30 FPS lock BOOOOOOO)",

It has a story similar to a mainstream anime with your typical anime trope girls (tsundere, childhood friend, cute sister etc). The game delivers the plot through visual novel type story telling and feels like a mix between a dating sim and your average rpg where the hero saves the world. The downside to the game seems to be the combat which can feel pretty clunky and fixed camera angles in certain places. If you are an anime fan that likes your average hero saves the world story and getting cute girls, you should give this game a try.  Pros: -Decent voice acting -High replayability -Tons of collectable clothes, weapons, accessories -Alternate routes and endings depending on dialogue choices -Getting a strip combo off can be very satisfying  Cons:  -Camera control can be awkward and is fixed near entrances making combat troublesome. -Targeting can be a problem when facing large number of enemies. -Combat can be annoying when facing large mobs as you are unable to dodge when attacking and can easily be attacked -Experienced crashing when alt-tabbing out of game in full screen mode",

You can complete most of the game in a single run and there isn't much incentive to play it again; unless you just like free roaming and beating things up. - Graphics are cell-shady and antialiasing is kind of lacking. Can be forced to downsample through some modifications, but not for the everyday person. - THE MENU IS NOT IN-GAME! This disables compatibility with in-home streaming and/or GameStream.

This is because all the button prompts in the game will use the controler keys rather than the keys on the keyboard that you are using. Once you get the hang of it, the game becomes very enjoyable and addicting. I am already starting on my third play through. The story is creative, characters are fun and enjoyable, and the battles are one of a kind. I mean how many fighting games are there that strip the clothes from your opponent? You have to damage your opponent's clothing with high, middle, and low attacks, then strip their clothes off. Giving you a chance to strip chain several clothings off at once. The more you strip the faster you have to hit the right keys. There's alot of side missions to keep you busy as well. I think my first play through was about 30 hours, if you take your time.",

No really, it feels a lot like the place. -Routes do feel diferent (well, most anyway ^^') -NG+ makes this a great timesink.  Con: -The concept. Not for me, I love it! But others might find it to weird. -The combat will result in a lot of button mashing every now and then -Hight difficultys are really REALLY spicky! (At least if you try to pull of combos) -Dont ever try to play it on a keyboard! It is ment to be a controler game.. and there was obviously no effort put to fixing it.. sorry. -It might crash.. especialy on menus. Save regularly (1 crash per 10 hours for me)  Overall: I LOVE IT! No.. I think I am biased.  You gotta be able to just take the premis for what it is: Ridiculess crazy fun!  And if you can forgive the occasional crash of course. But then again, my 70+ hours of gametime do speek for themself.",

For real.  -The story is kinda meh.  -Characters, you can love them easily then throw them out just the same.  (I got that Shizuku ending, she the best)  -Combat is obvious, strip them and dont get yourself strip.  -Combat can be dificult at times and confusing but after a LONG while you'll get use to it.  -Butt loads of costume(Armour) and weapons that keeps you experimenting and to keep you FABULOUS.  -Each weapon and I mean EACH(ok ok a good portion of it), has it's own set of combos some usefull others tend to get annoying or completely useless.  -The only complaint I have is that I really wish the game had a better dodging mechanic. Dont get me wrong yes you can counter really ♥♥♥♥ing easily in the game, but timing it is really a pain early in the game. So wish they had a better dodge mechanic.  Overall I really enjoyed it and yes depending on which ending you get you'll unlock that character, so you can live your genderbend fantasy that we all secretly have.   ",

            "review_text": "AKIBA'S TRIP has been a fun and enjoyable ride, for me. A lot of people are justified in their complaints that the game can be a little repetitive, as the routes don't differ very much (aside from Shion's, which does turn the latter half of the chapters on their head), and the combat can be largely the same routine over and over. It also doesn't necessarily have a ground-breaking story to help push it along.  But you know, I enjoyed it because it was the right combination between visual novel, action game, and silly anime love-comedy. It was fun, and while I probably wouldn't play through the game again, having completed all the routes, I still look back on it fondly and look forward to the sequel. Hopefully, they'll improve where they need to, and keep the rest just how it is.  If you play this game, try not to take it too seriously, and just enjoy the inherent silliness of a game whose premise is humorously stripping vampires in public.",
