            "review_text": "Strider stands as a reboot to an old Arcade series by the same name. The game stars Hiryu, the last remaining Strider to be sent on a suicide mission that involves taking down Grandmaster Meio, the iron fisted ruler of Kazakh City and the Earth and avenging the fallen Striders.  The game's mechanics are pretty simple, like an old school title should. It's structured very similarly to some older games like Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, Super Metroid and the such as it has a lot of backtracking as well as you gain new powers to unlock new doors and the such - which may lead to new powers, health upgrades, energy upgrades, kunai upgrades, etc. There's lots to find in the game.  It's a standard Action Platformer, Strider can jump and he can cling to walls to get to higher places. It's a very vertical oriented game and you will need to explore literally every nook and cranny if you want to find every collectible. As you gain new powers, such as the Double Jump, or the Blast Cannon later on in the game, you gain more mobility and ways to go about exploring.  *~Some stages have Two planes, meaning it's a secondary map of the same stage that counts as one stage. You need a Power for it, which you get early on in the game.  *~There's also a way to move about each stage quicker when later on in the game you get the Panther Upgrade. These are called 'Panther Runs' and they serve as key hubs in a stage, you essentially transport from one to another. *~ The Kunai (which is an upgrade btw - you may see it on a Loading Screen tip but cannot use them until you obtain them later on), is used to open doors aswell. You target a door's recepticle (not on the door itself), the door unlocks and re locks after a certain time passes, so you have to be quick on these aswell.  Some stages, like the 'Black Market' stage, have all sorts of traps and environmental hazards that serve as puzzles as their own. Taking damage from some of these traps can issue a 'Reset' where Strider teleports back to the nearest safe zone or they can cause knockback. In other instances, hazards, such as Acid or Lava, deal constant damage as you stand on them.  *Note - There is NO Fast Travel options for those out there that need clarification on this. If you take your time out to explore, just like in those titles mentioned before, you HAVE to travel back by yourself through the stage. Also, I'm not pointing out every way you have to open doors, that's part of the challenge.   Combat is pretty straightforward aswell, with a few twists. At the beginning, you'll have your basic Cypher (Identifiable by the colour scarf Strider has) which doesn't do anything right then and there. Strider will attack as fast as you press the button too which can help deal additional damage to bosses and enemies as well as the standard slash attack being omnidirectional. Wherever you point the analog stick is where Strider will strike. Ex- If you hold top right, Strider will attack top right. You also get a slide, which can help avoid enemy attacks and help you set up moves aswell.   Upgrades come in many different flavours. Your standard Cypher (Red Scarf - Also known later on as Reflective Cypher) gains the ability to deflect projectiles back at enemies and you also get a Charge attack very early on in the game which is needed to deal additional damage and break enemy shields. Cyphers also affect Kunais and Blast Cannon - but these upgrades need to be found separately. There are a total of 4 different Cyphers you'll be getting in the game additional to your standard one: *Reflective Cypher (Red Scarf) - Deals normal damage, adds the ability do deflect enemy projectiles. No special Kunai Upgrades, No Special Blast Cannon Upgrades. *Freeze Cypher (Blue Scarf) - Deals Normal damage, adds the ability to freeze enemies in place (enemies can be used as platforms). Kunai will freeze enemies on contact. Blast Cannon adds a wave where Strider is that will freeze enemies in place as you fly past them. *Fire Cypher (Orange Scarf) - Deals the most damage, adds the ability to damage enemies over time. Kunai will attach and explode over time on enemies or ground. Blast Cannon will damage and burn enemies. *Magnetic Cypher (Purple Scarf) - Turns Swipes into Boomerang (Cannot Mash button to attack faster - Have a max of 2 hits then must wait until blade comes back to you). Kunai bounces off surfaces, Blast Cannon deals additional damage.  Apart from these, obviously - Strider has 3 additional moves that expend energy, like the Kunais. Option-A (Eagle) appears above Strider and does a sweeping motion according from where it was summoned and hits for high damage, you'll be using this one a lot on bosses as it deals the most damage. Option-B (Panther) appears next to Strider, and moves forward until it hits a wall, then he runs the opposite direction (like a turtle shell in the Super Mario Bros games) and Option-C (Bots) summons two robots that appear around Strider that shoot spheres as you attack adding additional damage to your basic swipes.   Enemy types, sadly where the game faulters, is not very varied. You have your basic grunts with different weapon types - one can carry a Sniper Shot that if it hits you can cause knockback, another can have a rifle, shotguns, RPG's or a Machine Gun (deals most damage but won't see much of it during the game). Some grunts can carry shields - the non color shield can be destroyed by Option-A, Option-B or a Charged Swipe, likewise a Blue shield can only be destroyed by Freeze Cypher moves, Orange shields by Fire Cypher and Purple Shields by Magnet Cypher. The color shield enemy grunts only appear as you obtain the upgrades and then later on in the game, but they aren't really adding any challenge, more adding to the nuisance of having to switch Cyphers - like the Magnet Cypher, which was nigh useless to me outside of opening doors with it. One thing that annoyed me was how they only recolor the grunts and drop em on different stages, it felt a bit lazy.  Another enemy type, are flying bots that use about the same weapons grunt use and are really annoying, especially those that can cause knockback with rockets or heavy fire. Some bots later on, can actually charge at you and cause knockback. Then there are the larger enemies, like the Heavy Trooper (Yellow and Red) that have an arm that extends to where you are if they are facing you, or have napalm shots that home on where you were standing, you can deal with these guys easy though - the enemy that REALLY annoyed me was the Brainwalker, most of his attacks can cause knockback, he can charge at you and can push you off him if you're close enough - his shots can also home in on where you are. Bosses fare a LOT better though. They all have attack patterns very similar to bosses from games like MegaMan X and some are actually pretty tough like Solo.   All in all though, bar a few annoyances, like Strider not being able to slash downwards directly if you're not jumping, the knockback state, the nearly useless Magnet Cypher and of course the game being short - this was definately one of my top games for 2014 and my top one for 2014 at the time of writing. It harkens back to older games like Symphony of the Night/Super Metroid/MegaMan X. Plays like one, feels like one and is a very welcome return for one of my old school favourite heroes very easily worth the asking price.  Pros: +Amazing Combat System +Fantastic Stage and Level designs +Amazing Soundtrack +Game looks amazing +Great Particle and Weather effects +Bosses can be challenging and tons of fun +Tons to Explore and see +Diverse Upgrade System +Challenge Modes +Tons of Collectibles  Cons -Limited Enemy Archetypes -Magnet Cypher is nigh useless in combat -Knockback state can be annoying -Game is short -Odd Checkpoint system  ",

Light and heavy attacks mixed in with 3 different types of magic.   + Easy achievements    The Average  The overall level design itself can be a bit confusing and the method to traverse between areas can be cumbersome.    The Bad  - Voice Acting and dialogue are really bad  - I got a lot of slowdowns despite very little happening in the game.   - Frustrating encounters with enemies, you get knocked down over and over again with little chance of recovery.   Conclusion  A great 2D action platformer open world game. The overall level design is not as good as some of the best out there but this is still a great game to play if you are a fan of the genre.

This game is definately worth picking up, and has solid gameplay just like the games of yore, like Super Metroid and Mega Man X.

This hampered my desire to explore and as such I finished the game at only 75% completion when I usually shoot for 100%. The boss battles were the highlight though they also could bring some frustration if you aren't good at memorizing attack patterns as there is usually little to no way to heal in these encounters.",

            "review_text": "Short version: Strider is a 2D platformer with Metroidvania qualities, priced at $15. Beautiful visuals, heart-pumping soundtrack, simplistic storyline but a richly detailed world, can be completed in 6-10 hours. I recommend you play this with a controller, and that you have the specs to run it well. Buy it.  Long version: I had never heard of the Strider series until recently. I watched a series of YouTube videos explaining its origins, its evolution, and the clones it inspired. I then became quite interested in Strider, and decided to buy this reboot by Double Helix (makers of Killer Instinct). I have not regretted my purchase after a 12 hour playthrough, and I plan to 100% it in another playthrough.  In Strider, you play as Strider Hiryu, the last and best S-class Strider (ninja assassin). He is tasked with eliminating Grandmaster Meio, the ruler of a dystopian future Earth. That's the plot.  As stated before, Strider is a 2D platformer with Metroidvania elements. Your primary weapon is Hiryu's signature cypher, which he can swing as fast as you can mash the attack button. Throughout the game, you upgrade what your cypher can do, navigational movements for Hiryu, and 'Options', magic abilities. As well as assist in defeating enemies, these abilities can open pathways previously inaccessible, leading to secrets such as concept art and background information about the story and characters. Strider is riddled with challenging boss fights, each one is satisfying. All the bosses have complex attacks, but they're easy to learn and once you learn them, you feel great. (Can't speak for everyone)  Strider is a great game for both old-school fans of the series and newcomers that want a badass experience. I strongly recommend dropping the $15 on this gem of a game.",

This reboot borrows heavily from both the NES and Arcade versions of the game, fusing all the great aspects of both but also changing the layout of the entire game drastically for a brand new experience. Grandmaster Meio is the main villain so no worries for arcade purists. This is a true reboot and does not segway in to Strider 2 on the PSX or have any connection to any other Strider games previously released. The lore has been changed from Strider Hien's backstory to prove this.  The soundtrack is pretty decent, the newer songs aren't so great, they're more like ambient noises, however the old school remixed tracks are amazingly well done. The remixed tunes span across nearly every re-imaging of the game from the coin-op version, the turbo CD, NES and even a track from Strider 2. ;)  The gameplay is fast and frantic and once all of your abilities are unlocked you feel as if you can handle any situation and truly feel like an A-Class Strider. It can become a bit cumbersome while climbing around on ceilings but wall climbing is pretty solid.   Boss battles are fairly frequent and require some heavy memorization and skill if you plan to make it through on the Hard setting. Plenty of stuff to do and numerous reasons to re-play the game, speed running, 100% completion and of course becoming an A-Class Strider by conquering hard mode.   Definitely worth the price for any Strider fan, new or old.",

            "review_text": "Strider is an excellent side scrolling revamp/remake of a classic NES title from the late 1980s. You are a futuristic ninja battling against evildoers in a dystopian society.  This game is very comparable to other modern side-scrollers including the brilliant Mark of the Ninja and 360 Arcade exclusive, Shadow Complex. However, unlike Mark of the Ninja, the ninja in Strider does not rely on stealth. He relies on speed and using various abilities gained throughout the game.  Boasting excellent graphics and sound, Strider is a very smart and very fun game that I've been enjoying since I started playing. Like games of yore, Strider takes boss battles seriously and you will find a challenge early on in the game when you come across a boss. You must use strategy and learning their rhythm to defeat them. A few of the earliest bosses are relatively easy button bashers, but you will soon run into others that will give you fits.  This is a very strong effort and backed by Capcom, I hope to see more of these classic titles remade modern. I highly suggest a controller to enjoy this game to its fullest potential.  If I had any criticism of it, it would be that I wish the controls were a little tighter when evasion is important. However, that could be more down to my lack of precision than the game itself.   If you enjoy side-scrolling action games that remind you of the great games of yesterday or even if you're too young to remember and just enjoy an action challenge, Strider could be your ticket to fun. I'm 3 hours in and only 10% complete, so I'm hopeful that there's plenty more hours to come in this very fun game.",

The only thing I don't like so far is the soundtrack--I think they could've done a better job with the remix of the classic tunes. Should have been more dramatic with real instrumentation. Nevertheless, if you loved the previous games, you'll enjoy this one too.  Please note that if you're having problems getting it to start, turn off your antivirus and firewall, uninstall and reinstall it, and you should have better luck. I was having an executable error until I tried that, and voila, it boots.  Enjoy!",

            "review_text": "A delightful blend of all three past incarnations of  Strider , rebuilt with modern design sensibilities and polish.  Hiryu is, as ever, a joy to control, capable of traversing all manner of terrains with ease. A steady stream of unlockable abilities, power-ups, and hidden collectibles keeps the gameplay fresh while encouraging, and often demanding, exploration. While Hiryu begins with only his standard cartwheel jump and Climbsickle, you'll soon be Sliding, Double Jumping, and Plasma Catapulting yourself all over the map.  Combat has been improved in several ways, perhaps one of the most notable being the addition of aimable Cypher attacks. A seemingly simple change, but one which adds a great deal of depth and enjoyment to the formula. Other additions include throwable kunai, a launcher which juggles enemies into the air, a strong ground-slamming dive (Downstrike), and the Charge Attack, which deals greater damage.  Exploration and combat is further deepened by the return of Hiryu's robotic Option companions and the introduction of four Plasma Types (Reflect, Burst, Ultra-Cold, and Magnetic), which can be used to alter the properties of your Cypher, Kunai, and Plasma Catapult. In addition to their obvious combat applications, these power-ups can all be used to help traverse the map.  The art direction, helmed by  Strider 2's  character designer, is strong and substantive, providing a familiar look to the characters while updating them in new and visually interesting ways. Though dark and drab at times, the scenery is beautifully rendered and constantly sells the scope of Kazakh City, with vistas that stretch off into the distance, overflow with life and activity, and often become their own distinct sections of the map.  The soundtrack is incidental and moody with just a hint of dubstep, and contains a mixture of new tracks and remixed tunes from all three previous  Strider  games. The distinct 'shing' of Hiryu's Cypher and his ceaseless 'ha!' have been mercifully toned done, and the various bits of dialogue spoken by the countless grunts just before Hiryu murders them are a nice addition. Occasional announcements broadcast by a couple of the bosses can get a bit annoying, but are thankfully silenced after they are defeated.  The game is just long enough; a speedrun will likely take 2 to 4 hours to complete, but a full clear with 100% completion could take anywhere from 8 to 16. There are also a few unlockable modes, including speed-oriented time trials and combant-oriented survival missions.  All in all,  Strider  is a strong showing from Double Helix, and a particularily solid budget title. At the low price of $15, it's hard to think of a reason not to pick this game up -- just keep in mind that the system requirements for the PC version are fairly high.",

            "review_text": "6.5/10.  I was greatly disappointed by this game. A game by my favorite studio and gotten good critic and user reviews. But this game is the definition of mediocrity and blandness. Most of the game is spent running around the same looking futuristic drab landscape, where every level feels the same. You fight the same 3-4 guys the entire game (they try fooling you by changing color of the soldier’s uniform to make you think it is a different enemy…..I wasn’t fooled), minus the occasional mini-boss. There are many boss fights, which is a nice change of pace, unfortunately the game uses the unfortunate trope of repeating multiple bosses. The levels are big open levels, although they are mostly empty and boring, and involve much backtracking. Most of what you will find by searching around is boring concept art nobody every cares about.  The other thing you will find is upgrades. In order to gain any health or energy upgrades you need to scour every single level all over the place. You start with the smallest health bar I have ever seen in a game. Don’t play the game on hard because guys shoot multiple shots are once that are impossible to dodge, as you are the least elusive acrobatic ninja ever. All you can do is do a slow jump in the air where you spread out, or just run at people. There is a slide but it is slow, you do a spin first to do it, and you can still get easily hit while doing it. In hard guys do tons of damage, the health pickups give you almost no amount, and bosses take tons of retries. The terrible checkpoints mean you will have to start in areas before the boss and you will have to watch the crappy cutscene again. There is literally no story, and the small amount of dialogue/cutscenes involve terrible voice acting and models that (no joke) don’t open or move their lips when they talk.  Then there’s the combat. It is the most boring ever. You literally just spam x (basic attack) as fast as you can while running at guys. The same is for the bosses. You have a charge-up attack that takes too long, and an upward slash that is completely useless. You never learn combos or anything special. By the time you learn a teleportation, or using other elements in your attack, its 2/3 done with the game already. The first 2/3 is just doing the same slash move over and over with every guy as fast as you can while you run straight at them. It became so boring and monotonous that I just tried jumping past guys to get to the next area. You can also be continuously juggled and killed with certain enemy combinations, as happened to me a few times.  The platforming can be fun and inventive sometimes. You can climb and stick to walls, which is not common in many platforms. Unfortunately, more than not, it frustrates. It is very finicky and hard to control. There is a way to move fast up a wall, but not horizontally move across the wall, meaning it’s super slow. For some reason on platforms you can’t swing around from above to under it. If you try to jump from hanging below something you must drop first, then try to jump. Many times I would try to jump off the side of a wall and it wouldn’t let me detach. Other times I would try to jump over something and it would make me grab onto the side of it.  The worst problem I faced, above all else, was the checkpoints. On multiple occasions I would exit to a new level, and see a “checkpoint” icon in the top right. I would then quit the game, and upon coming back see that the game didn’t save my progress and I was back at a previous level. In one occurrence I had to redo an entire boss fight, and go to the next level again, because the same hadn’t saved my progress. What game in 2015 doesn’t save progress AFTER A BOSS FIGHT AND THEN A LEVEL SWITCH?”!!?! This meant that I would never want to exit the game, because I never knew what it would save and what I would have to repeat. I couldn’t even count on beating a boss or starting a new level to mean it had saved, as those normal staples were apparently not part of the game’s save function.  The game does have decent length, and I still BARELY recommend it because there are a few times where the game shines and the platforming is and inventive, or a boss fight is enjoyable, or some of the new powers you get later on, including throwing stars, teleportation, etc, are fun. I just don’t get why they have you get them so late in the game. The backtracking definitely frustrates as well.   There are MANY other better options in the action/platformer genre, and use this only as a last resort if you've run out of other good ones to play. Wait for a sale, as 15 dollars is definitely too much to ask.  ",

Soundtrack: Raid (The theme was great and you only hear it in the beginning but it is just so perfect and fits the stuff going on!) Coup (The music during the fight with Mecha Pon in the original Strider which was my goodness amazing) Grandmaster Meio (Surprisingly this wasn't a remix of his theme, instead it's more like electronic type piece of music nothing like his old theme) Siberian Tunnel (The theme to level in Siberia which was spot on and added a creepy mood the game. Fits perfectly)  +The soundtrack is just amazing and makes the experience so much more enjoyable. The Kazakh theme is just so great as well. You'll hear it a lot and it is just perfect for the action.  Gameplay: -The faster you mash the attack button for Cypher, the faster you attack just like the original Striders -His Famous Slide is still in the game. -Combat is a lot of fun and there are plenty of enemies to face. Though you might have trouble in the first run of the game but second run and you can mow through them. -Mini bosses add on to the game's experience which are fun and great. -Enemy Introductions  -The game plays very well and the new cypher types and abilities make combat more dynamic.  +Combines old and new elements to the game for an incredible experience. +Game plays like the Original +Brings back iconic enemies and bosses. +The Voice actor for Strider was spot on! You don't hear him talk much but it is a lot better than his UMVC3 voice which was like a black dude or something. He has more of a believable voice. -No Japanese voice setting.

Every upgrade you get feels unique and encourages different playstyles, the game designers did this right never holding your hand but giving you queues instead.  There are some negatives to this game that I really would like to see fixed in a next iteration: -Subtitles are huge and rendered right on top of the player sometimes, so you can't really see what you are doing on some bosses. -There is no way to manually mark objectives on the map. -Sometimes background objects seem like they are on the foreground. -The difficulty is uneven, I suggest playing it on Hard right away as you will breeze through most enemies, but the bosses will really make you dispair. I was stunlocked for 50% of my health on occasions. -Enemy iteration is too low, they are mostly reskined throughout the the game ( there are no fast melee enemies and they are sorely lacking as a foil). -No secondary main weapon though the primary sees alot of uses.

GRIN's Bionic Commando Rearmed is probably my favorite action game of all time, striking the perfect balance of classic 8-bit old school design and modern gameplay conventions into a blended whole that surpasses all prior (and sadly, subsequent) versions of the franchise. Amazingly, Double Helix's recent version of Strider does the exact same thing for the Cyber-Ninja that seemingly had a larger following in the fighting game scene than in his own titles.  Now, Strider's not BCR exactly. Some choices seem a smidge ill-fitting at first. Like the Metroidvania 'single grand level' concept seems odd when you have such a mobile character who traditionally has gone through disparate locales in his games like a horny teenager goes through tissues, but they pack it with so many devious traps to flip around and baddies to chop up in such a large set of locations you'll never notice once you get going. Besides, it allows for a 'just right' amount of item collection and several super-hidden spots concealing bonus costumes and concept art to give players their OCD collector fix.   In general, that's probably the best descriptor of the game design as a whole: just right. And it leads a constant cavalcade of classic Capcom chaos! So much so that there's little to actually say about most of the moment ot moment gameplay that wouldn't just spoil the experience if you're interested after seeing the trailers. Like the Matrix, you really can't be told how awesome it is to be Strider Hiryu, you have to experience it for yourself.   I for one, highly recommend plunking down the simoleans to give Strider a go. You'll be slicing and dicing through hordes of Russian Cyber-men within seconds, and flipping and ninja-vanishing around deadly traps while reflecting bullets into robots and summoning your holo-panther buddy to tear new holes into old foes for the next 4-9 hours depending on your difficulty and how much you want to collect.

The gameplay is fun as long as you keep moving forward. The second you start slowing down and exploring it becomes painfully obvious just how repetitive it can be. The plot is... well the plot is pretty bad to be honest. I'm not sure why Strider needs to do what he does, and I don't know why the villians hate him so much. It's just bad writing through and through. When I kept myself moving though I remembered why I enjoy this game though. When the action is fast paced it is a blast. The best time I had playing this was the couple hours I spent on my speed run. If you're looking for something fast paced that doesn't require much thought this is a good game. One other thing worth noting though is that if you're looking for a difficult game this isn't that game by any stretch of the imagination. Hard mode is what normal mode should have been. It is only truly difficult in maybe three spots. I never played easy mode, but I imagine that it might as well just be a self playing movie at that point.",

This game for being only $15 packs a whole lot of collectables and content which is a huge plus. It's fun, fast paced arcade style action at it's best and anyone who wants a game to kill a few hours, get this one, you won't regret it.  Fans of Strider will feel right at home, and even newcomers will have a great time playing through this game, you can beat this game in about 4 hours but with all the collectables you'll probably get at least 7, well worth it for a $15 dollar game! Honestly if you want this game, if the trailer looks good to you, if the things I'm saying in this review convinced you....BUY THIS GAME! You will not regret it.   The gameplay is solid, the bosses are challenging but fun, and the soundtrack is great! :)  -On a side note- There's a few glitches they need to iron out, for example; I fell through the floor and was able to traverse through part of the map on inside the walls and was able to skip a chunk of obstacles getting to my next destination but that's all trivial stuff that can be fixed, so I won't fault the developers for it.   All in all I thought the game was damn near perfect in every way, if you haven't already, buy this game especially if you played Strider before, this reboot does the series justice and I'm hoping there's more of this series to come in the future.

From arcade to consoles, it's been a fun ride for Strider, and in Strider HD/Strider 2014, you get a quite-faithful modernization of the classic. Upgrades and backtracking a bit for other unlockables, aren't too out of the way, but some require navigating with precise timing against hazards. Others need prerequisite skills to reach. Hey, like bosses that present at least a bit of challenge? The boss fights aren't boring, and run from signle foes, multiple bosses at once, giant whirring mechanations, dazzling explosions, lasers, and mysticism which isn't terribly predictable, and will give you a feeling of accomplishment, in their death throes. You'll be looking at your map to track down some unlockables, but despite the game having clearly defined locations to reach, you'll find yourself diverting to a far corner, to see if there's a bit of exploring to be had. Controls at later levels, with skill unlocks, becomes very wide-open, and you'll be slashing through rows of baddies!  Now, regarding the bad. This game is known to be unstable on integrated/discrete video chips, but seems quite reliable with dedicated video cards. Then, there's input; you may need a DirectX-XInput wrapper, like x360ce or others, so the game can 'see' your gamepad. After this quick bit is tended to, you'll be enjoying the variety of enemies and tactics! I generally think of reboots as trash, but this is one that is worthy of a few sessions on the couch.",

Bosses on the other hand blow, 4 of them are almost the same fight. 2 more are nearly identical. Every time you die to a boss you get to watch the same cutscene(s) again before getting another shot, including the one where you're told its name and title. You can skip some of the cutscenes with ESC but not the introduction ones. Writing is bland.   Footsoldiers are palette swaps of eachother and sometimes carry shields or guns that inflict different status effects. With the exception of shield enemies none of them pose any challenge. Shield enemies require a charged attack which also doesn't pose any problems as long as you don't face a guantlet of them.   Heavy enemies are also palette swaps of eachother and more powerful versions just mean they get an additional attack. They're damage sponges too, not much skill required just lots of jumping.   Players have a meter which fills by damaging enemies and avoiding getting hit. Next to impossible to fill during normal gameplay until you get the deflection power up, bullet hell guantlets force you to use it if you want to fill the meter. Unfortunately enemies in later areas have increased health and the deflection power up doesn't do nearly as much damage as the flaming one. The flaming one of course doesn't deflect bullets so the Charge meter doesn't see much use.   Really aggravating to get hit by electricity, you can often get stunlocked. Level design is decent but not overly complex. The ease with which you travel was clearly put ahead of complicated or intricate designs. Some hazards instantly kill you (sending you back to a checkpoint) and some do not, its unclear which is which until you find out the hard way.   Sometimes fails to load an area if you move too fast (such as by using the dash rings) allowing you to get outside the level boundaries, freqently locking you out of the level proper when it occurs.   Looks nice but looses frame rate during certain areas such as obstacle courses or areas with lots of electricity giving you a slow motion effect.  tl;dr: Running and slashing is fun, bosses and cutscenes suck.",

Castlevania Symphony of the Night is twice the game this is and 5 dollars cheaper. The whole time I felt like I was looking at a puddle. I started at one of the shallow edges, and then got my feet wet. Then as soon as I got in I am back out of it. Terribly shallow, and unsatisfying. Wait for a sale on this or avoid it even if your a fan of strider or metroidvania games.",

            "review_text": "Strider is a Metroidvania 2.5d game and a very difficult one at that. As of the release date which is today (Feb 19th 2014) the game has an issue with studdering and crashes for some people, as well as enemies hitting you when they really shouldn't have and not registering moves. Not sure if most of the stuff is unlocked later in the game or what, but I can't use anything like kunais... only jump, primary attack, and secondary attack and stuff gained later after a 'boss battle' (bosses become regular enemies after you beat the first one.) so the degree of difficulty is very high. Controls feel very clunky for most of the time.  At the moment, I wouldn't recommend the game to anyone not looking for extreme difficulty and platforming like crazy. If you need a game to hold your hand, look some place else. If you love challenging yourself, metroidvania titles, or speedrunning (which looks like it will be great for) then you should pick it up now, otherwise avoid at all costs or wait for a great deal. Some of these issues might be fixed in the next couple of days, so keep an eye out for that. Recommend a controller over a keyboard, but you can use the keyboard without issue; stablity really cripples this game severely.  Graphic: 6.5/10 SFX: 4/10 Music: 8/10 Stability: 1.5/10 Glitchiness: 3/10 Keyboard Controls: 4/10 Controller Controls: 7/10 Overall: 4.9/10 Length: You can beat the game in &lt;4 hours, but I doubt you will on your first run unless you are great at this genre. Difficulty: Very High.  I'd recommend this once the stability and glitches are fixed, which are understandable in a new release, but shouldn't remain for too long.",

When it's so pointlessly 'WE'RE EVIL LOL' that it breaks all immersion in the game, it's BAD. I can't take it seriously.  Then they had a single section that punished exploration. In a Metroidvania game. How stupid can you be? Fine, it's *ONE* place, but even that is enough to annoy me.  Also, naming your bosses after the Winds? Revengeance did it first and better. And it just makes me want to go play that instead.  Don't buy it, people. Not worth your money. The combat is dumb, the chargeup on the cypher is dumb, and whilst the movement is gloriously fluid and quick... that's the ONLY redeeming feature the game had to me.",

Dark background with barely anything visible, almost no background music(and the one you hear is meh), cheesy voice acting(zero effert put in that), repetitive boring enemies, unresponsive gameplay, boring level environment and the one that takes the cake is forcing you to play on a analog stick.  The gameplay mechanics in this game is locked, and you need to unlock it as you play through this bland game, I hate it when Devs take away all the fun gameplay mechanics only to get them back at the very end of the game, making the beginin of the game feel incomplete until the very end, even then game feels unfinished with it's boss fights having only 3 or 4 moves and no flashy animation, the game tries to make you feel your are progressing but you really aren't.  Double Helix is a prime exmple of why alot of westren devs don't understand Japanese games and try to change them thinking it would look better if looked more westren like(and I am pretty sure Capcom asked them to do this).  Do yourself a favor and play Strider 2 on the PSX classics, the devs on that game knew what people liked about the original, knew what to improve, what to change, what not to change, making sure the game is as crazy a the original was and never tried to take it too sriously.",

Upgrades are scattered throughout levels to encourage exploration, though most upgrades either increase passive states or change the color of your weapon without doing much to change how you use them. Overall a fun, but brief game that you can play for 5-10 hours, then move on to something else. Overall worth about $5 to play.",
