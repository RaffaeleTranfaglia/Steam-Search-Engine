I have to admit I didn't even think twice about buying this game, and when I did, downloaded and the title screen came up, a wee tear formed in my eye, It was my childhood returned.   I played this game when it was originally released and I'm that bad of a horder that I still have a hard copy of the game manual.   The only game better in the genre was Pharoah/Cleopatra.     ",
