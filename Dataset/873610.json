    "description": "Mr.Vegan is a game about a vegan bodybuilder flying on a chilli pepper in space... Oops spoiler... Not really, there are 3 locations: a City, a Desert, and Space. But this isn't all, whilst he's flying he only wears underpants for a... better experience... and better ventilation!",
