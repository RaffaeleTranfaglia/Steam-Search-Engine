            "review_text": "I could write the shortest review ever for Toast Time but that wouldn’t do it justice. Not entirely, at least. Because it looks simple doesn’t mean that it is simple. Toast Time is a port of the original iOS/Google Play game and it’s actually very fun (and frustrating) to play, even if you can clearly see its mobile roots.  The goal in this game is simple: protect the clock from ringing by fending off tons of enemies with your character (who is a slice of toast). You can do this by shooting bread at them and it’s done with the press of a mouse button. Simple. But, there’s something else you have to take into account. By shooting bread you will also thrust yourself into the opposite direction. Call it recoil, call it crazy physics, call it anything you want, but one thing’s for sure: it makes the game damn hard, especially halfway through the game when the levels are designed in a way that you can’t navigate through them properly without carefully planning your shots. It makes for some stressful situations as more and more enemies approach the clock and by missing just one shot you can risk losing the game entirely. Fortunately for us the levels are short and can be finished within several seconds to several minutes, max. Restarting them takes only a few seconds and after that you’re on your way again. ‘Just one more time’ is what you’ll be saying time and time again, because of the way the game (re)loads levels so quickly. Well played, Toast Time. Well played. The clock functions as some sort of base, by the way, and if only one enemy bumps into it you will fail the level. It’s absolutely necessary to protect it. A difficult task, but made easier with your (unlockable) weapons, which brings me to the following point: Collecting boxes during your playthrough allows you to unlock a new random weapon (of the collection that you already own) that might make your objective easier. For every x amount of boxes you collect you’ll unlock a new weapon. Some of them are useful, others are, erm, less useful, depending on the situation of course. There are also cosmetic items to unlock like a monocle or a tophat. Funny stuff, but not really needed for a single-player game except to give the character more personality.  Graphically Toast Time uses a retro look. Its graphics reminded me a bit of Meat Boy, or any other game designed by Edward McMillen. The older generation I mean. It’s flashy and there are a lot of things happening at the same time and it’s easy to lose sight of where your character is located because your character, the projectiles, the enemies and even the environmental objects are all white and therefore blend in with each other. It’s very easy to make mistakes because of this and I think it would’ve been a good idea if it differentiated certain things. Since the game was originally made with mobile phones in mind the game is also shown as a full screen rectangle (i.e. like the screen of a mobile phone) with borders on the sides that show off a bit of the environment. It works fine and it isn’t annoying or distracting. Sound wise the game is basic. The music is cheery and up tempo and the sound effects like shooting projectiles or smashing into the ground are satisfying. I don’t think the sound effects could’ve been any better to be honest, even if they are so basic. They just fit the style and nature of the game.  I think that finishing Toast Time will take at least several hours, I’m not sure yet, as I haven’t been able to complete all the levels yet. Some of them are just so frustratingly hard, and a few of them also require a bit of luck. But like I said, it’s fun for short sessions. Don’t play this non-stop. You’ll most likely get bored before you ever even finish the game. Short sessions are the best and I personally think they do the game more justice.  Toast Time is an excellent shoot ‘em up/tower defense/action game with a couple of flaws, but these can be easily overlooked. I, for one, had a very good time with it and I would absolutely recommend it to people who enjoy any or all of the previously mentioned genres.  [Rating: 71/100]",

Your weapons are lot of kinds of breads´n Toasts which make other kinds of dmg than the other.  Simple Funny pretty low price of this kind of fun  Worth the price. :3",

            "review_text": "A greatly underrated little game with amazingly energetic music.  Basically a shooter, you use the mouse to aim at silly little smiling monsters who are trying to break your alarm clock. Your guy Terry isn't hurt by monsters himself, but wherever he fires, he's flung in the opposite direction. At first this isn't much of an issue, but it isn't too far in where you're having to choose your shots carefully to stop your heroic slice of toast from getting hurled behind barriers and unable to hit his grinning foes. Additionally crates fall from the sky; shooting one gives Terry a random powerup from all those unlocked. Some of these require quite a bit of skill to use, but others fill the screen in a gratifying spray of breakfast ordinance.  Additionally, each level rates you on the now-traditional three star scale. Getting that third star in later levels can become a heroic undertaking. Sometimes it feels as if the third star, on certain levels, requires getting a specific powerup, which is a bit tiring. Still though, it is a fun little game that's worth a few dollars at least, and has been nearly invisible in terms of promotion. It's worth a look!",

Gameplay was inarguably fantastic, the graphics were nice and retro, though the music got pretty annoying and the resolution was mobile resolution. All in all, buy if you want to play it 2-3 times and ignore it after, that's what I did.",
