            "review_text": "Before trying the game myself I was optimistic and though that perhaps people just complain a bit too easily about drm's and stuff. But when I installed and tried to play the game the ugly truth revealed to me: The progress you have to go through to be able to play GTA IV was the worst drm bloatware online registeration bug-filled s**t that I can remember. To play the game you have to first notice you can't play without logging in but loggin with your valid user name and password fails. After a hour of googling and s**t you can start the game but notice that the game resolution is set to 800x600 and all other graphics settings are at the minimun. So you go to options to change that. Unforunately the game refuses to change any settings. So you end up googling again how to solve this problem. You find out that the game does not recognize more than 2gb ram so you have to use command line parameters to launch the game - something that Rockstar could have easily updated along the years.  Edit: I also want to give honorable mention to long unskippable parts like new game intro, which also cause your computer to go in sort of freeze state if try to close the game manually after accidentally pressing new game. Also, I want to give honorable mention to one of the worst menu navigation I have seen.  Excluding above the game is great. Now I just have to keep my fingers crossed and hope the game starts again next time I decide to play it...  Edit 12/2016: Apparently there's is new patch that is said to fix many issues mentioned above! Well I guess Steam didn't download it for me since options were still same c**p they were before. I wen't to options to see what happens when I change resolution to something a bit lower and the screen mode changed to windowed and moved partly off screen. I didn't see all buttons so I accidentally started new game. Of couse you can't skip the into so I ended up alt+tabbing and tried to close the game manually. But hey, you don't mess with GTA, it messes your computer so that you can't close the game that just froze and you can't get back to Windows either. Oh, One more thing. When I launched to game today, GFWL installation screen popped up and the only option to choose was to uninstall it. I didn't uninstall it since I though it was still need to play the game. I don't know what that was about. Now should I change my review .. Huumm...  Nope",

            "review_text": "GTA IV is a very sad example of a PC game.  Since building myself a new computer, I decided to download it again to see how well it runs. Here's my specs:  Intel i5-4690k @ 3.5ghz, OC'd to 3.9ghz, quad core.  16GB Corsair Vengeance Pro RAM Nvidia GTX 960 (2GB)  Now, you'd expect a seven year old game like GTAIV, even a pretty intense one, to run flawlessly at 60FPS? No such business. While at times I had no issue reaching ~55fps, generally in less intense areas like cutscenes or near trh beach, the game stuttered all over the place in more detailed areas like Roman's house at the very start. This is pretty terrible.  Now, I hear tell that GTA IV is probably a prime example of the worst PC port from a console game in existence, maybe besides Saints Row 2. I'm inclined to believe that.  Even after tweaking settings and telling the program that yes, I did have a lot of memory and a good graphics card, and feel free to use it all instead of constraining yourself, the stuttering did not go away.  Now, all this would be irritating, but playable. The game's certainly still playable, though the stuttering affects enjoyment. The storyline is pretty good, albeit darker and grittier than previous and future GTA installments.  The best thing ever:  With the demise of Games for Windows Live, it is now nearly impossible to save your game. You must jump through hoops in order to get it to save offline, which means the online community is totally dead. Coupled with the fact that it uses FOUR methods of DRM:  - Steam (on its own, not an issue) - Social Club (notoriously ♥♥♥♥♥♥) - Games for Windows Live (♥♥♥♥♥♥ on release, dead now and unusable) - the much maligned SecuROM, well known and unstable.  You're gonna have a bad time.  Four DRM systems all running at once, coupled with poor optimisation and a shoddy PC port, as well as serious issues with saving the game (it asks you to sign into GFWL, which doesn't exist anymore - you have to use third party tools to even get the game able to save progress) means that I would absolutely not recommend this once great game. It's too far gone to be worth buying anymore. ",

            "review_text": "8 years since Rockstar released a patch for this damned game.  Before Windows 10 released, this game worked like a charm for Windows 7 and 8, it was rough around 8, but it worked. Then Windows 10 released, the game would not boot. Yesterday night, Rockstar released a patch for GTA IV that would fix the issue on Windows 10, the game no longer requires a login at startup, just click play and go.  Games For Windows Live, it still exists, and surprisingly, it still works on Windows 10, Games For Windows Live is completely optional, you're not forced to use Games For Windows Live for single player use, but if you wish to play online, or get achievements, you need to create a microsoft account, and login with that.  The game will still try to install Social Club stuff, which is normal, that's just to activate your game and connect to their servers, which is completely normal and understandable. You're not forced to create 2 accounts to play multiplayer or to even boot up the game, which is a huuuuuuuge plus.  To summarize this, Rockstar finally did something good after some years, releasing a patch for a better game, with a better multiplayer experience. Props to you, Rockstar, props to you.  Side note: Those having issues with trying to play the game (Press play, steam status changes to 'Playing Grand Theft Auto IV', then it goes back to 'Online'), try uninstalling any mods or mod menus you might have installed... Currently that seems to be a huge issue with everyone trying to play this game, I haven't tested the game with mods, but I might test in the near future.",

Niko and I share some common traits. We're both Slavic. We both have a good taste in automobiles. We both have cousins. We both have bad taste clothing. And anytime we find a girl, they usually end up being spies for the authorites. I will admit that I didn't immigrate from Albania or wherever he's from. But still, you can see the resemblance. The story was very immersive. That's about it. You play as a Slavic dude and shoot people. That's it. SPOILER ALERT: People die, and especially the ones that are on the sidewalk because you're too drunk to realize that you can't drive after taking an absurd amount of gummy bear vodka shots. I will also say, that the multiplayer for GTA IV is way better than GTA V. I don't want insurance, or the ability to have my own house. I can get that in real life. I just don't have the money.   Overall, I give this game 8 half-finished bottles of vodka out of 9 hammer and sickels.",

An in-game update is required and at the end you need to quit game to continue updating.  4) YOU CANNOT QUIT. I had to restart my computer 4 times just to quit. I could never quit in a normal way. When you try to quit, a black screen appears. Guess what, you also can't close the game using task manager. This screen prevents you to see other windows, the only way to quit is restart. 5) GFWL, GFWL, GFWL 6)  GFWL   So I couldn't even play a minute. I have no idea about in-game things.

The second time, I made it further into the game but again stopped playing coz story was boring again only that this time I had so much money which I apparently couldn't even spent like buying a new home or car that I wasn't willing to continue...

The game itself also filled with present day pop-culture, political satires and parodies you could laugh to yourself while listening to the radio or watching the TV show and the ingame internet.  The story line itself is comparable to 5 stars quality movie, as the player gets involved with the story of modern day balkan immigrant Niko Bellic as he travels to Liberty City seeking refuge from Serbia and his past. Throughout the way, the player feels sympathy and passion for Niko as he goes through love, hate, revenge, and all the modern emotions in real life with GTA IV. Liberty City of course based on New York, there are some familiar landmarks where epic shootouts take place in the game. The game is worthwhile just for the storyline and all the interesting characters alone that are involved with Niko's criminal activities in Liberty City.  GTA IV has great story, and one becomes rather fascinated with all the characters towards the middle part of this experience. So before playing the newly released GTA V, take a step in a few years and play a game that truly revolutionized the GTA franchise, IV.  Pros: +Great story +One of the best voice acting in video game +Good Soundtrack  +Great 'dark' vibe +Realistic physics engine (Euphoria Technology), still better than Watch Dogs +Video editor, great for movie making +Modding of course  Cons: -Games For Windows Live (no explanation needed its pure sh*t) -Console port, need a good pc to run in good settings -(For some audience)Slow paced gameplay, dont expect Michael Bay-esque gameplay -Clumsy controls great animation though  Score: 92/100",

It was very badly ported to PC to start off, and since Rockstar never repaired the game after Games for Windows Live shut down, the game is rendered unsavable and Multiplayer cannot be accessed even after the fix (this is not an issue as Rockstar shut down Multiplayer regardless). Also, if you are a fan of dull, flickering textures then this game is for you. Don't forget the unforgivable lag on high-end PC systems.  Looking past the appauling amount of technical faults that this game has, I still enjoyed the plot of the game very much, and I think that the variety of things you can do and access is creditable. Just don't expect much content in terms of weapon types, and unlike GTA 5 there are no weapon or car modifications available.  To conclude, I think that you're infinitely better off getting this game on console, as you will be able to void the bad performance, glitchy textures and the inability to save without a fix (which you can find on the Steam forums thankfully).

Otherwise, I advise against buying this game on PC unless you think your computer won't have an issue or that you can fix the issue. I have given up on it but maybe you can do it. Waste of my money.",

The forums are full of people who've paid money, can't play the game, and get no support from Rockstar. This is bordering on a scam at this point. The DRM is more extreme than any game I've every played. It requires games for windows live, which was a bad idea even before it started to get shut down. It uses securom which is famous as one of the worst bits of DRM anywhere. And on top of that it's not maintaned or supported to even the most basic level. This was the laziest of ports to start with, and it treates its audience, ironically, as potential criminals. Only buy this if you want to give your money away with little to no chance of getting to play the game itself, especially on windows 8.  As to the gameplay, compared to the previous game this is a tedious slog. The best cars handle as well or worse than the worst cars in vice city or san andreas. The story itself is grey, depressing, and lackluster. The missions are so poorly done comedian Dara o Brien even does a bit in his stand up show mocking it. The ending, not to spoil it, is miserable. Just give the entire game a miss and pretend it never happened.",

I nagged my father to allow me to use the funds, and he relented at about 10:00 that Friday night. I bought it and downloaded it overnight (I had a laptop at the time, so it took quite a while).  The next morning, I loaded it up for the first time. Immediately as soon as the ship cutscene started, I got graphical glitches and lag, although I attribute that to the laptop, not the game. Besides those technicalities, the game appeared absolutely gorgeous. The graphics (despite me setting every option on low, and despite the glitches) looked stunning to me, as I had never played anything as close to graphical perfection at that point in my gaming career. The dialogue also seemed to be my type of style - clear, sarasctic, and on occasion, angry. And this is just from the opening cut scene!  After the cutscene, I gazed upon Liberty City for the first time. Good Lord. For someone who's closest 'open-world' atmosphere was frigging Delfino Plaza in Super Mario Sunshine, this was like an entirely new path suddenly appeared through the darkened forest of 3rd-party Nintendo games. No longer would basic linear gameplay amuse me as much as the expansive and neverending environment of GTA IV.  After staring at what little of the City I could see (with Roman probably anxiously awaiting me to actually drive to his apartment), now I'll talk about the missions. Honestly, I haven't done many of them in my 42 hours of gameplay - only up to the drug dealer house raid (however, the missions do explain aspects of gameplay in a well-scripted manner, and are exceptionally fun). Why haven't I played more of the main story, you probably won't ask but I'll still say the answer anyways? Two words: Free Roam.  The ability to do close to whatever I wanted in a gargantuan city with no setbacks (well, the cops maybe, but I just turn them off when I create a game for myself)? It was heaven for me. Most likely over two thirds of my hours in the game are from free roam alone - single player free roam nonetheless. I just found so much to do. Pretend to rob a Burger Shot armed with only grenades before blowing the place to Kingdom Come? Check. Launch off the ramps at the airport then dive out of the car and hope not to die? Check. Jump out of a helicopter and attempt to crush a pedestrian from 500 feet up? Check. The possibilites are endless, at least to me. I could go on and on about my Liberty City exploits, but I'll just leave it there.  Of course I have a few minor qualms about the game. Fire kills you way too easily (Stop drop and roll, good lord Niko...), the cops can be absolutely relentless on 3 stars and above, and sometimes the physics just...go away (*coughSwingsetGlitchcoughDon'tHurtMeIEnjoyTheGlitchToocough*).  However, despite these few setbacks, I absolutely love this game. Overall, 9.5 out of 10. While waiting for GTA V to come out for PC (if it ever does...), buy GTA IV. Even if it isn't on sale, it is definitely worth the price. As I sit here at 10:07 at night, finishing this review while listening to UFO's phenomenal album 'Phenomenon' (See what I did there? Oh who am I kidding, you probably did. Ignore me...), I can safely say GTA IV is one of my Top 5 favorite games of all time, putting it amongst the other greats on my Top 5 Games list; Half-Life 2, Luigi's Mansion, Pokemon Fire Red, and Team Fortress 2.

Both the storyline and the questline is big and amusing with many missions and many outcomes. The only thing I did not like in this game is the fact that the experience bars, which were used back in GTA: San Adreas (Driving Skill, Stamina, Muscle etc.) were removed and also the way that Police officers react and move ( for example: You crush into a traffic light and no attention is paid. Yet you touch their car? They shoot you down! ). I mean wtf is this logic. In conclusion it is a good and fun game to play.  I give this game  8/10 ",

This game has got lots of issues,it's hard to even get in the game,that's why I got so many hours,but only like 80 hours were played.A second ago I finished this game,and 100% I mean.I feel so relieved,because it's so hard to do it because of the bugs in this.But I still have to recommend this game,I had fun with it,the story feels great,you even get to chose who to kill and who to let to live,and other decissions and the game even have multiple endings,2 in fact,but still,it's more than one,and believe me,it's a big difference and if you will get to this point,it will hit you emotionally.Get this game,on a sale it's only like 5 euro,and for 5 euro,believe me,you will have lots of problems,but you can get over 100 hours out of this game,and that's a lot.Even if it's got all this bugs,I enjoyed it and I'm going to do some achievements,as much of them as I can,and play some online,I'm going to get more than those 80 hours,because the game is fun,but,I'm going to do a pro/con list.  PRO:-The game is gorgeous,and I'm still amazed by the fact that you can get a chopper,get to the top of the sky and see the whole game at the same time,you can even see,barelly,but still,can see the cars moving on the islands and boats and everything,and it looks so good.  -The story is well made,even if you may not feel Niko,but you will feel for the other characters and care about them and you will feel bad if you don't show on a meeting or things like that.And if some of them get killed,man,it's hard.  -Carefull on detail,I mean,when it's thunder,you can even see the people how they get scared,or when it rains,they have umbrelas,and there are lots of other little things that make it great  -It's funny,especially the shows,I found myself laughing like I haven't done in a long time,especially the comedy show.The cabaret may scare you a little  -The girls look good,I mean,you can go into a strip club and while you're going for your private dance,you can see her ♥♥♥♥ shaking while she is walking,man the developers had a lot of fun doing this part of the game :))  -The cars look good,almost every car looks like one you would like to drive,and that's a cool thing  -The drunk camera is great,it shakes so good that I feel drunk myself and I feel sick after,it's really well made  -And there are many other things that you will fall in love with this game if you will try it,and I recomand you to do it.  CONS:-The game has lots of troubles,LOTS  -You need a social club account and a Games For Windows Live account before you get to play it  -The social club will say that it doesn't recognizes your details most of the time,or some ♥♥♥♥,that he can't connect,you need to wait like 5 minutes with social club on before pressing the play button,but it's playable  -You will maximum get around 40-50 fps out of this game,and you will encounter framedrops like around 10-20 fps,and it's the game,not the PC,so don't worry,but it sucks  -Your friends will want to go out a lot,they tried to make it more realistic with this,but not every player wants to go out so much with them,but a little secret,you can say you're going and 'cancel plans' a minute later and they don't get upset anymore (You're welcome)  -The motorbikes are rare in this game,and you won't be able to get back up on the bike a lot when you fall,because,if it falls somewhere where it shakes,the game won't pick it up for you,and you will have to search again for one and you need them for the stunt jumps especially,so it's bag  -Another bad thing,the stealing,you will press the button to steal a car and Niko will start running for the car,but when he is close to it,he will slow down and wait for it to go again and then he starts running again,so the only way to steal a car is by stopping it first,and it's really annoying  -If you're doing the 'most wanted' thing with police,if you will be too close to the guy,the game will tell you that it updates his profile and it will block there,making you to restart the whole game,waiting again for the social club and all that  -The bowling and pool are bad,I mean,it feels good,you want to play more,but it moves bad,it happened that the bowling ball will hit Niko's leg and it will go out,or the white ball in pool will fly over the table because of the framedrops that are making you to shoot a little harder  -Not many clothes to choose from and most of them are looking bad  -NO CUSTOMIZABLE CARS,this is something that I really felt disappointed about,you only have the paint spray thing,but no customizable  -And there are a lot of problems with the game,things that will stop you from reaching 100%,or not letting you play and from what I've heard,you can't play it on Windows10,and a lot,a lot of other things.  Yeah,I know,lots of cons,but I guarantee that you will enjoy this game,buggy as it is,it's something funny about it,it has something good,and for 5 euro on sale,you can at least try it.",

This port was HORRIBLY optimized, even the best gaming pcs have trouble running this game.

CONS: -Despite aging well, it needs third party visual patches (bad bloom) -You need a DLL (XLiveIess) to save your game now -Probably the most horribly optimized game in modern PC history  I need to expand on just how terrible the optimization is. It doesn't have many glitches and the glitches that exist are your typical funny GTA glitches, but the performance of this game is dreadful. My GTX 650 is above and beyond even the top GPUs of 2009 and the game struggles with high res shadows, which still look blocky and overall like crap. Without shadows the game is almost unplayable, as if everything's made of mold.  GTA 5 runs better than this, and that's really saying something.",

You play as Nico, a East European fresh off the docks of Liberty City, who's coping with the demons of a violent past while making a life for himself in America.   Pros : The city looks pretty good and is very open. Walk into multiple stores, apartment blocks and warehouses. The city is divided in islands, making it slightly easier to navigate from one neighborhood to another as you eventually determine you personal favorite routes to each bridge. The city, the characters, television, even the game's internal world wide web reek of sarcasm about the flaws of capitalism, and so does the cliché but nevertheless interesting story. Get involved with gangsters, bikers, russian mafia, corrupt lawmen, and manage your friendship with different people in order to count on them at a later time. Driving is smoother than ever, but mastering it becomes a must soon enough.   Cons : The character graphics are already showing their age. The humor is much more subtle and won't get more than a chuckle out of the average player. The subway and train are poor alternatives to stealing the first crappy car you come across, and you'll only ever ride public transport because a mission requires it. Managing friendship also becomes a pain, as you force yourself to stop the action and story to keep your friends level up or risk loosing the service each provide, even permanently lose some of them. With the exception of a few safe houses, you no longer have any purchasable houses or businesses.   Verdict : ★★★★☆ - Next on your list!  This game isn't perfect, but I'll still recommend it. The city feels alive, you can hear the people on their cells, behind their food carts, yelling and swearing at each other, getting into fights, causing accidents. You can easily immerse yourself in Liberty City, just as long as you are know the plot feels like a 90s crime/cop action flick.  —————————————————————————   This was just my opinion.

It had more freedom and things to do than all the other GTA games. You can date via internet, rob a bank, play taxi driver, or be a stealthy hitman. Overall though I found some of the additional things annoying... culturing friendships as they call and pester you all day was annoying. The level of detail put into the city is amazing and the volume of models, cars, boats, ect is very high. The voice acting and story is great. The vehicle control feels like driving, its nice.  However this game suffered from the same thing I dislike about all the other GTA's.... poorly controled 3rd person camera perspective. The camera and difficult controls left me feeling frustrated at times. Niko feels like controling a cyborg without enough oil in the hydrolics.  Worth it if you love 3rd person perspective, in sandbox areas, and fun story/voice acting.",

If you do some reasearch, you'll run into many hacks and weird methods of getting it to 'think' there's more memory available to it, but that won't work either. You will also run into patches released by Rockstar, but guess what? These fail to even install.

(Sucks, I know - but I only said I would guide in how to get it running...) * Launch the game - Steam should prompt for you to note the serial number down. I noted it, but didn't need it as it copied to clipboard. Write it down anyway. * Skip the Social Club login and select 'Play Offline' * The game should launch. Before doing anything, log into Windows LIVE with your Hotmail / Outlook / LIVE account. (If you don't have one - create one prior.) * LIVE will then prompt for your serial key - it should already be there. (If not, refer to what you noted down.) * If your serial and password are correct, LIVE will pull your profile down.  - We are not done yet! -  Give LIVE a few moments after login to apply an AUTO UPDATE - once this is downloaded, the game should close and the Windows LIVE update will apply.  - We are not done yet! -  * Navigate to the folder where you installed GTA. (Usually under Steam &gt; SteamApps &gt; Common) * In the 'Grand Theft Auto IV' folder, navigate to the 'GTAIV' folder. * RIGHT click on the GTAIV EXE file and go to PROPERTIES then select COMPATIBILITY. * Check the tickbox for 'Run this program in compatibility mode' and select 'Windows XP Service Pack 3' * Check the tickbox for 'Run this program as Administrator.' * Click OK. * Repeat this process for the other two EXE files in the same folder. - gta4Browser and gtaEncoder  - You should be done now. -    Good luck, cousin! Now we can go Bowling!",

However! Upon trying it, I was quickly impressed with *both* the immersion of the characters and the story (not something I give full credit to that easily) as well as simply the gameplay of it, and could still spend twice as long on rampages as I could playing the story straight and not get bored of them. It has its limits, of course, and the mini-games and friendship/relationship aspect do lose their novelty not long in.. but for all that, this still would have to be one of the most enjoyable games I've played in recent times.

I'll admit I was one of the five smug jerks who had literally zero problems running the game on my modest hardware back in the day. My day of reckoning has certainly come to pass. Call it karma.   This time around with slightly newer hardware, and a shiny new OS to boot, it all went the way of the three legged giant sloth. Or was it three toed? Either way it was garbage, except hang on... this analogy makes no sense. To cut a story that is and should be short to its correct length, the game unexpectedly played like crap.  On the bright side, I can personally vouch for the fact that it does actually play on Windows 10. The backward plague that is Games for Windows lives even seems to be working. The performance problems were initially hard to deduce, however I eventually narrowed it down to the shadows. The bloody ugly pixelated shadows that somehow only look decent at the very high detail setting were the problem Go figure. The abhorrently inelegant solution was to simply turn them off. That brought my frame rate up to a stable level (at least 40-50 fps all the time rather than sub 30). This is of course not totally groovy. The game still doesn't play half as good as it should, but at this point I was willing to take any small victory I could get my greasy paws on.  Anyway, yeah, 20 hours in, no crashing. I have been having a problem with the character model not showing up every time I load the game. The solution to that is to change the reflection quality in game. Again, stupid problem deserves a stupid solution. Such is life. ",

            "review_text": "REVIEW - Grand Theft Auto IV  Interestingly, even though I've had GTA IV on my PS3 since 2009 or so, I never managed to finish it, and only bought it on Steam this holiday sale, and managed to complete the main storyline in a few weeks.  As a 'GTA-veteran' (Played III, Vice City, San Andreas, Liberty City Stories, IV &amp; V) of sorts, I will say my personal opinion of the game after completion.  What I'm about to say may shock some and surprise others in a positive way.  I think GTA IV is the best GTA to date right after GTA V.  Why? It doesn't have the customization of San Andreas, its vast scale (or V for that matter), nor the exotic feeling Vice City gave us. It has annoying friends calling you every few minutes asking you to go bowling or play darts with them. It has nearly zero side-content (all it has really are some random stranger missions, a bit like RDR and V)  But what it has is the best atmosphere of all GTA games, minus V. You really feel you are in Liberty City, the districts feel different, and the city just seems...alive.  I will categorize this review into segments.   Spoilers will be avoided to the best of my ability just in case someone is yet to play this game.   S T O R Y ---------   You play as Niko Bellic, an Eastern-european immigrant 'migrating' to Liberty City (parody of Manhattan &amp; surrounding boroughs). Your cousin, Roman, has sent you emails about how life is great and how he's living the 'American Dream', so you head to the US of A to check things out. Needless to say, things arent' as shiny as Roman said, and Niko needs to build his way up from the bottom to achieve some...personal goals.  Overall, the story is both weak and well written. Weak in that it's bloated and far too long, it has a huge cast of supporting characters and for some people it may be hard to actually keep track who's who. Also the story does grow stale towards the end and at least in my opinion some very minor characters got far too much screen time. Well written in that it's a gripping and a gritty tale of how humans can never truly escape their past, and how we're driven by revenge. The storyline takes around 25-30 hours, i'd say.   G A M E P L A Y ----------------  The gameplay is essentially non-linear &amp; open-world. Right from the beginning, you're thrown out into Liberty City (namely Bohan, one of its districts) and you're free to do whatever you wish, though I will reiterate there's not much side-content on display. Most of what you can do is hanging with friends, date girls, buy clothes, get drunk, and shoot cops (lol) apart from the story missions there are also the so called random stranger missions, which usually feature an errand or some other short job to do. There are also assassination missions. You can buy weapons and body armor. You can drive cars but they're not upgradeable aparts from a paint job. Also, the car handling is absolutely terrible. they slide like they're on ice constantly, even the fastest sport cars! No idea what Rockstar was smoking when they decided on the car handling.  Liberty City is divided into boroughs, which are separated by bridges, at the beginning these bridges are sealed, but when you progress the story you open up more areas and are free to roam wherever you wish on the map.  The game is driven by EUPHORIA, the physics engine that is absolutely fantastic. It simulates stuff like bullet impacts, crashes etc realistically so for example no 2 deaths are the same, people don't just ragdoll, they die realistically falling to the ground as you'd expect a shot/hit person to behave. It's absolutely one of the game's highlights.   Cop chases get harder as the rating (the wanted system is divided into 6 stars, all representing more advanced police forces after you) rises. On lower levels escaping is pretty easy but past level 3, it gets really tricky. Expect to die a lot in cop shootouts.  Also one complaint I do have is that there's no checkpoints during missions save a few exceptions, there are a few things more annoying than playing a mission for 30 minutes straight and ending up losing because you crashed and died so you have to play the whole freaking mission all over again. Though the checkpoints were added in subsequent Rockstar releases, this is really something noticeable.  Overall, i'd say the gameplay is fantastic, I enjoyed greatly just having a go at the cops and escaping, watching them stumble as i fired my gun at them or just being a nuisance and crusuing away, or just eating at restaurants or enjoying the sights the game has to offer.     G R A P H I C S &amp; A U D I O ---------------------------  I gotta admit, I played the game with an ENB config, because I did not like how the game looks by default, so I will not comment on the graphics too much. Overall it has aged quite well, way better than say, GTA: SA (which was a last-gen game, to be fair). The textures are okay, if a bit muddy, the lighting by default mostly works, but is better with an ENB.  The game is notorious for being awfully optimized for PC:s, my rig (i7-2600k, GTX 670 2 GB &amp; 16GB RAM) runs the game at around 40-45 FPS with an ENB enabled at high-ultra settings, but i'm not so nitpicky on that, just be sure you have a good computer if you wish fluid performance.  The audio is excellent minus some of the gun sounds, for example the pistol sounds like a BB gun, not an actual Glock.  There's 18 radio stations ranging from talk (Integrity) to rap (Beat 102.7) to even eastern-european station (Vladivostok FM), plus you have Independence FM which you can use to scan your own mp3 files and play them in your ingame radio, handy!  There's also a soundtrack, but it is mostly on the background and not noticeable during gameplay really.    Overall, the audio is solid.     C O N C L U S I O N ----------------------  I said at the preface I think this is the best GTA after V. So do I recommend it? Yes! for 20 € (or whatever your currency is)?Well, maybe. It has a bit of a steep asking price for a game that came out in 2008, but I believe it's an experience worth getting, especially on sale. The game also has a very active modding-community, so that is one good reason as well.  If you want a game about playing as a criminal who's likable even though a bit cynical and pessimistic, act a jerk in public, play through a gripping story, and experience the city that never sleeps, in an open world that's sizeable and full of life, what are you waiting for?  Get this game.  Enjoy Liberty City!  PS: Ignore Roman most of the time, he just wants to see 'American ♥♥♥♥♥♥s' or go bowling.",

On top of that, it's modding community alone is worth a buy, even if you already have it on consoles (like me).  My recommendation would be to obtain or build a 'Period PC' for this game (I would go for a Core 2 Quad or Duo partnered with something like a Radeon HD 5770 or similar, with a few gigs of RAM), with an install of Windows XP or  {if you have some sort of deathwish)  Vista. And this is all assuming you would go through all the fuss anyway just to play a game that's nearly a decade old without support, when you can buy GTA V that would be cheaper and easier than running around eBay or craigslist for ageing hardware (or rummaging around your attic for that old Vista pre-built), and will run on an operating system that you could comfortly live on.    I mean, seriously, San Andreas runs better on newer hardware...    Through all this, I would still recommend, if you're willing to put up with it.

I tried some mods to improve the visuals (which worked to some extent) but the real problem is the FPS issue. It's constantly up and down between 5 and 60, which makes it very unplayable. A shame as I've just finished GTAV which played perfectly.",

I was incredibly excited to play this game since the last GTA game I got to play was San Andreas before taking a personal sabatical from gaming. The GTA franchise was by far one of my most favorite that I've ever gotten to. Which is why I ALMOST tolerated creating 2(!) seperate offline accounts just to begin. I didn't and still don't understand the point but I tried. And then I got to the second account that has 0 to do with playing this game. Attempting to register and then login to Xbox live on a PC is worse than pulling teeth. Error after error, forced 'upgrades' that didn't work one after the other, until finally, 2 hours later, i was persistant enough to get it to work.  So finally, I'm in! Time to play and catch up on what I've missed since San Andreas! Nope! Impossibly wonky controls, streets that wouldn't load so it almost always looks like you're drving on 'water' (which is an insult to water as it's more of just dark blue tiles in the middle of the city) and finally, an error when I tried to save after putting up with this mess for 2 hours saying that Xbox Live wasn't properly connected. Never again. And I've been a fan since top-down, GTA 2 through San Andreas. A 2 man dev operation like The Binding of Isaac guys can constantly release impecable content and fix bugs almost immediately but a team of hundreds that make up GTA employees can't even get one of their triple A titles to work on Steam? Disgusting. Thank God for Steam refunds. Not worth the $10 I paid for 5 games. Hell, I'd have been happy to pay $10 at least to be able to play GTA IV alone.",

Story wasn't anything special, but kept you interested enough to continue playing. Personally I didn't like the main character at all, being eastern European myself. City was big and alive, yet looked bad with low resolution textures everywhere. Vehicles looked good, with a lot of detail and good physics. Gunplay didn't have enough punch and shooting felt unsatisfying. Characters looked decent with good facial animation for that time. There are some activities in the city , like bowling, darts, pool, etc., that will entertain you a bit, but most fun is in story missions. Aircraft controls were horrible, and very hard to navigate, unless you play with controller. For those who like to run around killing and blowing stuff up, this game isn't really good for that, you tend to die fast unless you're in cover, so I recommend Saints Row 3 or 4 for that.

It turns out almost every single part of the Xbox website is full to the brim of redirect loops, making it physically impossible to make an account on that website, just to sign it into some external program that I had to download just to have a chance at having the game survive for over 4 seconds.

And still the gameplay felt below average to say the least. At the beginning it is kind of fun, but then the missions get really repetitive and the interactions with NPCs outside of the missions are annoying and time consuming. You’ll spend most of your time fixing the NPCs’ mistakes and running errands for mid-level gangsters. After about 30% of the game you’ll have reached the ceiling of Niko’s potential: you become a mid-level muscle and that’s it. You’ll spend the next 70% of the game without rising up in the chain of command. Compared to the previous titles this one is really subpar, especially when it comes to voice-acting. I really disliked Niko’s voice-actor, his accent was distracting and his general performance was cheesy, nothing like Ray Liotta in Vice City or Samuel L. Jackson in San Andreas. It seems to me that the studio tried to save a lot of money hiring unknown actors and counting on the game’s hype to be successful back in 2008. I did finish the game and AT TIMES I had fun, but to be honest most of the time I was doing missions as if they were chores, not something engaging that would deepen the story. I don’t recommend this game unless you are going to play it for the sake of curiosity, otherwise I would skip directly to GTA V. Also, you’ll need a lot of patience with Rockstar Social Club, which at times wouldn’t recognize my password even after I had changed it.  PS: the high point of the campaign is Ricky Gervais’ stand-up show. But you can see it on Youtube, so…",

The amount of hours I've spent so far are not representative of the countless hours I've spent messing around in Liberty City back on the Xbox 360. GTA 4 has one of, if not the best, narratives out of all the GTA games. Niko Bellic is the most human GTA protagonist in my opinion and has earned his place as my favorite videogame character of all time. Sure, the game hasn't aged well, but that's the beauty of the PC version! Just download a few graphics mods and even some crazy/funny mods to keep the game fresh. Hell If I could spend 300+ hours on the Xbox 360 version, R* clearly did something right! I also feel the same way with the Episodes from Liberty City, which are badass in their own right. Buy this game. This is the last GTA game that kept the spirit of the older titles while having it's own unique aspects.",

I understand there are priorities in creating a new game engine, and adding features into that engine. I even say so considering the disastrous port to PC, which took 3 years to sort out.   Rockstar like developing games on console, I can tell. I can understand why, too. But PC is obviously where it's at, and I think they're finally starting to realize it. (as of 11.11.14) we're a week from GTA V launching on current gen consoles, and two months from launch on PC.   GTA IV recieved the heaviest criticism of any Grand Theft Auto, and I never thought it deserved that. Everything about it with the exception of flight was a leap forward. I'm amazed it raised standards as much as it did, while staying so well rounded. No part of the game outweighs another. And I'm even more impressed that Rockstar could make not one but three characters that would otherwise be alien to most people, but make them seem so relateable and familiar.  Grand Theft Auto burns through societal narratives like a laser and calls social justice warriors on their bluff. Art imitating life, that's what pisses so many people off and that's why I love it.",

I hope updates will keep on going for GTA IV because it's poorly optimized for PC after many years of release.      GTA : San Andreas : CONS &amp; PROS    PROS :    +3 Huge city areas to explore with countryside missions and desert  +Huge list to complete for 100%  +Knownable movie actors with Samuel L. Jackson +Dating +Gym +Car school +Burglar missions +Taxi Missions +Police Missions +Ambulance Missions +Vigilante Missions +Street Racing +Casino Missions &amp; Casino Gambling +Drive by shooting +Eating &amp; Clothes Store +Endless of other things you can do+ +Funny traffic when you get on a highway    CONS :   -Flying school is annoying and hard -SPOILER ALERT : Taking enemy hoods is annoying to finish last mission -Catalina calls are annoying -No achievements  -No Multiplayer or CO-OP (only moddable) -Lot's of racist and bad language in the game (annoying) with usage of drugs and alcohol -Chris Penn (Officer Pulaski) acting was terrible for the game",

Not only that, I also had to run 3 other installers manually just to get the game to launch on my PC.   Game looks cool but all this stuff has me EXTREMELY frustrated.   Do yourself a favor and don't buy this game. It's not worth the frustration required just to start playing.",

The best thing, as I told before, is the possibility to do all you want from steal a car, helicopter or plane, kill criminals, police or peolpe in general, to visit all restaurants, bars and striptease locals of Liberty City.  If you don't have anything to do with assassinations or murders and you want to change your chip to be able to do something different, you can simply and dedicate your time to explore all the city with car or by foot.

The story of GTA IV is well paced and has a good plot while the story can be quite boring unlike GTA V’s but that’s just my opinion. The weapon system is nice and well balanced (Unless you cheat I’m looking at you Will…). The handling of cars is quite good but not amazing and every car’s engine sounds exactly the same. There are plenty of things to do other than the story like taking part in races, Pool, Darts even golf. You can also take part in side missions or “friends” as they are called. These are ok while some of the missions seem to feel a bit pointless. The weather is dynamic with rain sun and sometimes wind.  Now about the poor port. I have a fairly high end rig and it handles the game perfectly at 60 fps 1080p. But…. The amount of graphical options is not good enough to support other people’s rigs like people who are using multiple GPS or people that are using a low end rig, it’s hard to set the options just right to make the game run how you want it to. The game is not suited for keyboard and mouse but it works well enough to be playable but you will not get a big vantage over people in multiplayer who are using controllers. But we must remember that the game came out in 2008 (about 6 years ago) so hardware has moved on leaving the game behind. It’s still a great game though while it still has its flaws it’s a good game. Rockstar have confirmed they are working harder on the GTA 5 port though which is good. I would rate this game 8/10. ",

Upon booting up the game, there's absolutely no sound whatsoever, and neither is there music. Funnily enough, in the Credits, some guy was actually credited for 'Sound'.  Anyway, you have only two gameplay options: Custom Race and Random Race. Custom Race allows you to select your semi-trailer truck and the course you race in. There are only FIVE tracks-No wait! Scratch that! FOUR tracks! One track isn't even playable, as loading it crashes the game! Anyway, all the tracks overstay their welcome, and last around 5 minutes. On top of that, they have absolutely nothing to offer and they do not stand out from each other in any way. Oh yeah, and Random Race automatically selects your truck and track (So you may have a 1/5 chance of crashing the game).  Now that I think of it...The game is not only extremely bland, but borderline broken. You're supposed to deliver cargo while being chased by police. The questions are: Where are the police? What's this truck doing here? Why won't the truck move? Where's my cargo? How come my truck controls so stiffly? Why do I move so freakishly fast in reverse? Why do I stop dead in my tracks when I stop reversing? Why can I go through all the objects as if they have no substance? Why can I drive up and down mountains? WHY IS THIS GAME SO UTTERLY BROKEN?!

As you would expect, Liberty city is a concrete heaven, but a very lively one at that. It's alive to the point where you could remember what some of the pedestrians might say when you cut them off in traffic or pull out a gun infront of them.   The story in GTA IV to me is the best in the series. I'll leave it to you to experience it yourself and have your say.   ",

After finally playing it over LAN I discovered you can't even cheat.

I know I have played myself sick of it, but it didn't take much time before I went on with the DLCs doing just the same. Completing everything possible.  The only thing I wanna complain about is how few people that are actually playing ranked multiplayer. It's kinda sad to spend so much time doing for example all the achievements, and then going on to mulitplayer...but then see noone playing ranked. I am glad I have a friend to play with MP with me or else I would have been more or less alone....  But this part actually pisses me off. Whenever you wanna play ranked with a friend...it won't work. The game designers made the game so you can't play with people on your friendlist. Luckily for us ranked worked when I removed myfriend, and we communicated through skype...and he easily found the game. A bit too hard for 2 or 3 people to finish off achievements, mission timers or doing something bigger, when there are so few playing.  Anyway. GTA 4 is awesome!",

            "review_text": "Grand Theft Auto IV is a very fun game, period. Throughout the GTA series, we have seen open-world settings and sandbox style gameplay. GTA IV has these qualities, but not to the same extent as other titles in the series.  Pros: GTA IV manages to retain the satirical style of past titles, and takes it to a whole new level. Often times I sit in my vehicle, not doing the objective because I want to listen to the hilarious ♥♥♥♥ on the radio, such as Integrity 2.0 or Judge Grady. Also they added TV, which can be pretty funny as well.  Grand Theft Auto IV has a strong campaign mode, which has a variety of different style missions, not just the same thing over and over. It has strong character development across the board with only a few exceptions.  GTA easter eggs are everywhere and they are often very clever. I could spend hours on the in-game internet just reading funny ♥♥♥♥ and looking for easter eggs.  Cons: The game has a lot of focus on the story, limiting many of the activities previously available on other titles, such as being a cabbie, a paramedic, or changing your appearence to appeal more to others. GTA San Andreas is probably the second best or best title in the series, and from San An to IV Rockstar cut a lot of stuff which they could've added to make the game so much better.  My main issue with GTA is that often I found myself always doing the campaign because there was nothing else to do. Once I beat the game, which was pretty fast, the only thing to make it fun was modding. Modding is by far the best part of gta 4 for pc. There are so many creative mods out there that completely change the game for the better. But I shouldn't have to mod to fix Rockstars mistakes.    In summary, the game has a fun campaign with many hidden secrets, but after that's over there's nothing to do and you have to turn to modding. I give the game a 7 out of 10 because of it's lack of freedom outside of the campaign. Other than that I still recommend it because, you know. It's GTA",

The problem with that is the fact that GFWL doesn't work anymore, so you need to google a way to bypass that. Once you've figured that out, you may have an infinite loading screen that takes some time to fix. And finally you will have to go into the launch options to allow you to change your graphics settings. After all this the game runs fine on windows 8. But I do recomend that you get it on a console rather than a PC.  Or just pay $60 for GTA V.",

It feels like you are really living out as Niko, and te story is slow, which gives you a better grasp of understanding the charecter. Also, subtle changes to him over time really show charecter development.  The visuals Technically worse than V, but the shadows are better (at the hit of performance) and the art style is very different than V. GTA IV goes for a muddy, gray, city art style. I recommend the simple ENB for natural and realistic lighting to complement the vannila lighting without totally destroying it like icenhancer does.  The combat and walking Very much worse than V. You have to spam the run key to run at max speed (leftovers from the console port) which is annoying and tiring. the hand to hand combat is terrible, with slow, inconsistant controls. The shooting is average, and really nothing special, but the guns feel kind of weak. However, I do enjoy running and pushing people, which gta v lacks.  The driving Better than V by a mile. The driving feels realistic and your car wont be able to handle corners at 100mph like it can in V.  the engine overall better than V. V had many visual upgrades to the RAGE engine but it suffered from bad ragdoll physics and car deformation that made GTA IV a classic. In this game the cars will bend and twist with ease like in real life. Also, when you bump into someone they wont just fall over and splay out, they'll stumble around, and possibly regain their balance.

To be fair, this glitch only happened if you used certain cheats such as the riot cheat, but we didn't know this at the time. GTA IV, however... I could never even get it to load. I spent HOURS trying to make it play. Youtube videos, Google searches, advice from friends who owned the game, nothing made a difference. I can't even give a review on gameplay. I never got to see any. I'm glad I got my refund and I'm seriously reconsidering buying GTA V due to the mess that happened and is still happening with GTA IV. There is not a single viable excuse for leaving the game in the condition that it is currently in and should be removed from Steam until it is fixed.",

Hell, in order to SAVE PROGRESS in the SINGLE PLAYER, you NEED to log in to Games for Windows Live.   And if you want the game to work on modern systems, you have to download Games for Windows Live from the Microsoft site, and run the game in Windows Vista or 7 compatibility mode.   Oh, and it runs bad, unless you have a specific system (with a quad-core CPU, 4+ GB RAM and a GeForce 8xxx or 9xxx graphics card) or an very high-end rig. My 2015 mid-range gaming system did alright on High settings, until I stepped outside during daytime and the FPS dropped to 25. The mouse also starts to get really laggy.  If you still want to play the game after all the negatives I mentioned, go ahead. It's a great game. I really like the gritty atmosphere, focus on one character storyline (vs. GTA 5), complete sandbox multiplayer (unlike GTA 5) and of course Euphoria physics, which make hitting people with cars, pushing and punching people, as well as falling out of a car just a bit more fun.",

I've experienced crashes using mods, that ain't Rockstar's fault, but when the game started to crash EVEN without mods and after clean installs... Welp, I can't do anything about that. I was barely able to play Episodes from Liberty City because the simple action of driving a car would result in a CTD.  The story is far from interesting, there's no way to really care about any of the characters and the police reaction to any crimes is simply bad, they show up almost immediately for a game that tried so hard to be ~REALISTIC~, and they shoot to kill even when you're unarmed.

You meet friends, girl friends, some back stabbers, lone sharks, drug dealers, drug users, and a hole mess of characters. My only complaint is you couldnt upgrade your stats like San Andreas, or get hair cuts, or tatoos, or unique clothing. Another thing that bothered me was the fact that you couldn't customize vehicles. That was my favorite part of San Andreas. The Multiplayer was surprisingly successful too. customizable characters was a good touch. several different game modes was a good thing. Theres isnt really a 'Co-op' mode, but ther is team mafia work where you get a job and you and your team have to complete it before the other team. There's also Death-match, Race's, Free mode, Party mode, and other player created mode like Zombies, Gun game, and Role play (my favorite). In Roleplay you get a house/apartment. you can buy a car and earn money in Liberty City by robbing banks, or doing several odd Jobs.

Saying that, I put in a fair bit of multiplayer time with friends (of a similar opinion) because its kind of on its own when it comes to online free-roaming. At least it was prior to things like the JC2mp which has sincerely killed this game off for me. The BOGT was much better to play if I remember correctly but IV; just no.   Note that I say it doesn't stand the test of time as a nod to anyone looking to buy it and its not necessarily a relative term. I had it on PS3, what, not even 18months after release? and it was still one of the worst games to actually play and remains so. This doesnt reflect the story which I've seen others finish and know fairly well but on merit as a game to play, just no.  It also likes to try overly push your PC?? I have a high end rig and sailed trough everything maxed out (usually floating about 60fps) but this thing just forces my GPU to crank up for a game which isn't even all that?? It plays fine but it seems to put undue load on the system. Also, Games For Windows Live wasnt great but it wasnt that bad for me (I've heard its dead and gone now anyway??) it at least worked and didnt kick me off to maybe update or for a laugh???

Yay: - Awesome storyline  - Characters feel personal - Plenty of mods Nay: - Little character customisation - clothes, etc - Money has little value. $1 hotdog + a few guns + $500 armour is all you need. - Small map - little to explore - Driving dynamics are heavy, slow and somewhat lacking - Shooting mechanics are clunky and the target lock is sometimes confusing - Constant, annoying requests by friends to hang out - Games for Windows LIVE is ♥♥♥♥. - Kate won't have sex with you, and is a boring character.  GTA IV was a leap for Rockstar graphically. It brought the franchise into the HD era. The story was beautifully done, but that's about where the good ends. A cars that handle like boats and a small map mean exploring the world is not much fun. Shooting - a core element of the GTA series - is slow and the target lock isn't as effective. A common GTA trait still shows through - selecting weapons. Scrolling through a list is ineffective and can often ultimately lead to your death.  Games for Windows Live doesn't help either. It's a major annoyance. Also, multiplayer is boring and lacking. People are either antisocial by not interacting, or socio/psychopathic who wish to end the lives of all other players.  Instead of buying GTA IV now, wait a few months until Rockstar release GTA V for PC.  SPOILER: *At the end, you can either make a deal (which ends with Roman's death) or take revenge (resulting in Kate's death). Choose the latter. Kate is a boring character who does nothing with you. Roman at least has charm.",

The only motivation our Niko Bellic gets to complete a mission - 'I need money'. That's it. And ok, that could work if only there was anything to spend those money on. But alas unlike GTA SA there are no businesses to buy in GTA IV, not even safehouses - they're earned through missions. It gets ridiculous by the middle of the game, when you have over $100,000 cash (with full ammo on all weapons and every piece of clothing) and our hero accepts little nothing for $3,000 saying 'I'll do it if it the pay is good'. There are some interesting realistic background stories though, just not about the guy we're controlling.  Also the game is plagued by graphic engine. While using video memory as currency to spend on graphic options might seem interesting it introduces more issues than it solves. For me it was locked at lowest quality and resolution because it somehow calculated that 202 MB used is more than 4096 MB available and required a little hack to get out. And there are many more issues, see for yourself in discussions.  It also requires you to register on Games for Windows to save your progress in single player, and one more account on rockstar social club for multiplayer. A bit annoying compared to how easy it usually is to get other games on steam working.  In the end I'd give it about 4/10. It's a pretty basic 3rd-person shooter with some driving arcade and ridiculous 'I'll do it for $100' story cutscenes.",

Here the missions are mostly drive there, kill somebody, and lose wanted level. Ok at the end I got some helicopter and boat missions too, but 80% were simple kill missions.

I think the Episodes from LIberty City have a better time of it - both being shorter games than this and amping up the fun in the missions.   I'm not one to ♥♥♥♥ around and just blow ♥♥♥♥ up like some people so it's only really the story for me. Here, it's kinda disjointed, barely held together by the usual GTA personalities. Nico himself is well, contradictory to say the least and a bit boring.  Oh, and I had to use FRAPS to slow down the framerate in the last mission so I could to a QTE to get into a helicopter. You heard that right. Because I had a better computer than when this was released I had to limit the framerate of the game otherwise it was impossible. Yay?  ",

Grand Theft Auto IV is probably one of the most entertaining open world games that I, myself have ever played. Now, with that being said, I also haven't played very many of these types of things.   It's amazing what a thrill that driving around in a stolen station wagon as fast as you can with a 5-star wanted level with the cops on your ♥♥♥ can be. Either that, or you could be just out on a Sunday drive with nothing to worry about. Do whatever, go nuts. It's your game. And the gamemodes are a different thing, oh man. So much.  Well, now that I've flattered GTA IV as much as I could, there are some huge drawbacks that I need to talk about.  Let's start with the singleplayer story mode. While I admire the cultural diversity of the characters in the game, I can't understand Little Jacob's accent without having to use subtitles. I'm playing a game, I don't want to have to read subtitles, sorry.   Now onto the thing I was saving for last, ♥♥♥♥ING MULTIPLAYER. Oh dear god, I have never had so many issues with trying to play in a multiplayer game. First off, Games For Windows Live is a ♥♥♥♥ing nightmare. It took forever for me to even see the light of day in multiplayer mode, because Rockstar had to be a special little snowflake and use GFWL instead of Steam like everyone else. I understand the importance of collecting gamerscore while getting achievements, and infact I wish that Steam would start doing that too, but come on. I'd only played the game for about an hour, and I'd already found that GFWL was broken. I had to download the main GFWL client, then Windows Essentials, and then I had to delete xlive.dll from the game files. It made me tired. I don't want to play a game that makes me tired. But hey, at least they let you use your Xbox Live account, right? Hah.  And then finally, the moment I've been waiting for since the age of however old I was a week ago, I finally am able to join a multiplayer game. I was playing for about 10-ish minutes and then I get a screen that says 'You were disconnected because your computer is running too slowly.' What. My computer is fast as ♥♥♥♥♥. Last time I checked, I was well over the reccomended quality and quantity of hard/software and ♥♥♥♥, and now this? My computer's fine, jackass. But that won't stop the game from making me eat ♥♥♥♥ 9,000 times in a row. (How do I fix that? It's driving me insane.) I even turned my graphical settings to the point where it feels like I'm playing on the Dreamcast, and still nothing.   Despite all that I said, this game is still very playable. I wish that I had the option to write a neutral review on this, because I recommend it but I also don't recommend it as well. Let's stop.",

First off, the download took ♥♥♥♥ing hours, nearly 14 GB. Finally the ♥♥♥♥in' download finishes and I start the game. I have to creat accounts with like a billion different ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ peice of ♥♥♥♥ things. Why the ♥♥♥♥ do I need a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ing Social Club ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ account? Then I have to sign in with ♥♥♥♥ing Windows Live Games which is ♥♥♥♥ing stupid, they should not have done that stupid ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Okay I already have a Windows Live account, so I sign in with my info and then it tells me that it has to download the profile or some dumb crap. Okay, do your thing, Game, I just want to ♥♥♥♥ing play. Sure, I could stay offline and play but then I CAN'T EVEN ♥♥♥♥ING SAVE LIKE WHAT THE ACTUAL ♥♥♥♥ COME ON! Okay after that, here comes up another message, saying that there is an update and if I decline to update I will be signed out. I accept, just please for the ♥♥♥♥ing life of me I want to play this stupif ♥♥♥♥ing game normally. The little progress bar just ♥♥♥♥ing sits there. No progress what so ever. Then it tells me it can't download or some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and then tells me to check my internet connection. I open Chrome and go to sites like Facebook, Youtube, Reddit, and whatever else. Everything is ♥♥♥♥ing fine. I go back to the game and it goes back to the original screen where it says something like, 'You aren't signed in, if you want to save your game then sign in.' I go through the process ALL OVER AGAIN, hoping it would work. It's an endless ♥♥♥♥ing cycle. Okay, whatever, I'll play offline. I start out in Roman's car, the frames are kind of low but I've already fixed that issue (kind of). I start driving, but the car is so ♥♥♥♥ing stupid. It lags when you accelerate, it's like it just drops from 50 mph to 30 mph in a second, and then goes back to 50 mph. What the ♥♥♥♥? I'm running into problems with this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game around every ♥♥♥♥ing corner. I have a pretty decent PC too, it's not a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ little laptop. I have a desktop with an AMD A8-6500 (3.5 GHz quadcore), 8GB of RAM, and like 4GB graphics but it's integrated or some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. This is ♥♥♥♥ing stupid. This game was made 6 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ shit ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ years ago and my computer, a recent HP Pavillion, is having problems with it. What the ♥♥♥♥ is this bullcock? I just want to play the ♥♥♥♥ing game and have fun and install mods and play with my friends. NONE OF THAT IS HAPPENING. Seriously, holy Jesus Christ on a ♥♥♥♥-stick. And no Roman, I don't want to go ♥♥♥♥ing bowling you autistic ♥♥♥♥♥♥.",

First of all, this PC Port is one of the laziest game ports I've ever had the opportunity to play. It's like playing an emulator. I ONLY get about 59 FPS average maxed out in benchmark for my powerful gaming rig. A game made in 2008. So if you don't have a gaming PC do not attempt to play becuase you will get better FPS in the PS3 port.  Once you start up the game, you will get the first account log in feature 'Social Club'. If you do not create one you can't play online and it restricts you from other online features, none of which I care for. At this point I said 'Okay, it's just one. Let's keep moving.'  So then I am at the main title screen. My settings were automatically set very low so I went to edit them in the options menu. I then see how it says I do not have enough video RAM to increase the graphics. My video card has 4GB of VRAM. I looked up why this was happening and it's because if you have more than 2GB of VRAM GTA IV detects it as less than 2GB of VRAM. So then I had to exit the game, and open the launch options and enter in some lines of code that helped fix this problem. After I rebooted the game, and I could finally max it out.  So I play the game, and get through to the part where I get to Roman's apartment. Then, at the first autosave I was then confronted by Games For Windows LIVE. I needed to be logged in to GFWL just for my game to autosave or it would disable autosave. At this point I was really frusterated. For the second time I exited the game and created literally 2 more accounts which were Microsoft related which took atleast 10 minutes for me. I then rebooted the game and had to restard all over again. I finally could autosave.   So no, I do not reccomend this crappy port of GTA IV to anybody. A waste of money. An extremely terrible port, you need to tweak with the games properties in order to actually customize your settings if you have more than 2GB of VRAM (which most people who game do) and you need to create several accounts in order to have full access to the game's features. I gave my money to play the game, not have to deal with all of this bull. Do yourself a favor, and get this magnificent game on a console instead.  ",

This game, its a ♥♥♥♥♥ and cant handle as much as our beastly gaming towers! But this game, is amazing.  I personally only play for LCPDFR a mod where your a cop. But ummm yeah so if you are thinking about modding and want to play online join a clan so then you are not with randoms who have the whole game as a mod. Me, I prefer offline. Hate online games to be honest but anyway:  Here are the mods I personally recomend  1. LCPDFR 2. Simple Native Trainer 3. ELS 4. ANY CAR MODS 5. FIRST PERSON 6. ANY ENB TO IMRPOVE GRAPHICS (ONLY FOR PEOPLE WITH 60FPS ON MAX SETTING OR MEDIUM) 7. PED MODELS 8. GUN MODELS 9. ANY WORKING SCRIPTS THAT BENIFIT YOUR GAMEPLAY 10. MAP ADDONS (OR MAP REPLACEMENTS REALLY DOESNT MATTER)  Now for all these things you need or may like to use OpenIV The simple more modern version of SparkIV. You need GFWL to play if Windows 8 or Higher.  All in all if you are great at waiting for the game to start up because of how many times your almost definite to crash then you'll love it!  This game was my first ever Xbox 360 game and now my first pc game (Thav ive learned to mod in succesfully)  ~PEACE",

I've got a really crappy 7 year old laptop and it runs pretty solidly.  Now, the pro's: -The game is just straight up fun. Whether you're driving around running people over in single player or teaming up with some buddies to take out the cops in Multiplayer, it's a lot of fun. - It's got a sweet open world city full of civilizans, and hidden secrets...  The cons: -The story is... well pretty bad. I might be in the minority here, but the story did not keep me interested in the slightest, you're an immigrant, in America, than after 4 boring missions you go from working a taxi company to doing hits for some guys working with playboy? It's really dumb and takes way to long to unlock new islands... -Games For Windows Live is here, and it's angry. You want to save? Than you better be logged in to GFWL, otherwise... no saving for you. Or get the mod to remove it... -The city, while big and varrying, is completely empty. There's the food places to get food to eat, some clothing stores, and 1 bank you can go into for no purpose at all. Other than that, this is just a sandbox really... there's nothing to do other than drive around.  So with all that said, do I recommend this game? Yes. Sure the story sucks, and the world is empty, but get together with some buddies and see how long you can last out against the cops, or download a mod that allows you to Roleplay as a cop, or really anything.   It's a fun game that's hampered by a poor story and boring world. the GFWL can be fixed, the bad optimization can be fixed and if you dont' like the story... downlaod a 100% save file...",

I know there's this violence issue, but hey, I've been playing this for over a hundred hours on Steam alone (I also have it on disc), and I don't feel any urge to pull random strangers out of their cars and go for a ride. At least not more so than before playing GTA 4.  Not only do you get a ton of missions, a really long story and lots of side-quests, it's also set in a pretty big city. It'll take you quite a while to drive from one end of town to the other. If you've ever played Ultima 9, this is the complete opposite! And aside from the main story there's lots of stuff to do, like:    Going to a strip club   Driving around on a car   Driving around on a motorbike   Driving around in a boat   Flying around in a helicopter   Jumping from said helicopter in order to land in a lake but closely miss and end up hitting the ground right next to the guy sweeping the park   Running over pedestrians   Walking around in the middle of nowhere because you trashed your vehicle and there's no other in sight   You can also be a taxi-driver, a cop and possible other stuff. Even after over a hundred hours I still have a lot to explore. The reason for that pretty much is the in-game video editor. You can actually record clips of all the crazy stuff you do and edit them. Cut out useless material, edit your best stunts into a single video, play with camera-angles and -movement, add music and export it as WMV.  So, to sum it all up: GTA 4 is an awesome game, and if you don't mind the violence it really is a game you should check out.",

Eventually I fixed it, and it runs smoothly and its actually an okay game. I'm not sure if multiplayer or the save thing will work though. 6,5/10  OLD REVIEW (16/12/2013) : Unplayable. No, seriously, its completely unplayable. Sure, the game starts up fine and everything BUT: You have to register for three different services before you can actually save, and sometimes it needs to patch which means you have to close down the entire game, deleting any progress you've made so far, and sometimes the patching for GFWL doesnt even work, and if you go to the support, you just get the 'Whoops, something went wrong!', therefore you literally CAN NOT PLAY THIS GAME, and with GFWL closing in July 2014, you arent able to save AT ALL. Sure, the graphics and everything looks fun and great, in fact I really wanna play this game, but I cant because of the ♥♥♥♥ing idiots over at Microsoft ♥♥♥♥ing everything up. 0/10, absolute waste of a game.",

PC has terrible performance for a game that came out in 2008 my pc with 2015 parts (GTX 960, i5 4460, 8gb ram) this game runs 60fps at a mix between medium and high but not very high preset or everything completely max, max settings causes me to get about 30fps and the game doesn't have any anti-aliasing option for some reason so its always jaggy. But in 2016 you wouldn't buy a game from 2008 for graphics although you might expect to run it maxed, you might not unless you have like a 980ti or maybe like a 970 at least.  You need to have a Games for Windows Live (GFWL) account for this and option but recommended Rockstar Social Club account, The GFWL account you need and you need to install a program, launch the game, make an account, put in a code that the game gives you and then you can play finally. Note that the Rockstar Social Club account is needed to play online which i think might have some players but not many but if you have friends to play with then thats helpful but if you really want multiplayer/online then thats what GTA 5 is mainly for.  8/10 For overall game if you are looking at the console version mainly, 7/10 For PC Port due to the terrible optimization but has mods at least",
