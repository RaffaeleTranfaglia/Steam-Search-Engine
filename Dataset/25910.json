            "review_text": "Honestly, this is a great game for people who really love strategy games. It goes so insanely deep with you having control over every little thing, and it's just astonishing how much you can really do. Scenarios, diplomacy, products your empire carries, imports/exports, and what's great is that most of that you don't even have to keep doing yourself, because your advisors can take care of most of it (With some guidance, of course. Don't make that economic advisor bond your nation to debt now...) And with how much you can do in the military! It's great being able to micromanage everything. Plus, it's real-time, and all the wars happen at once. There's no turns like in the other games like Civ, and you can really do a lot at once. And, if you really love global RTS, you get all the nations, plus some scenarios to make the world even more varied than before, like a 'Shattered world' map. If you don't want to take the time to learn it, then of course you'll hate it. But once you get it, it's a load of fun every time you play it.",

            "review_text": "Absolutely a great game, extremely in depth strategy that is difficult to master but feels so rewarding. If you buy this game prepare to grind through rough times before you understand the game, and be ready to watch plenty of barely helpful youtube videos to try to understand it all. It'll be hard but once it all clicks amazing things happen.   Protip: Blitzkrieging only works a couple of times early in game. Once you get later in game you will need high level artillery and nukes so start researching and building them early. When you're ready build a wall of infantry and armor and place your artillery behind them and move up slowly while obliterating anything in your path. It took me 9 months (in game) of shelling Moscow to get it to fall. Have fun!",

            "review_text": "This game (and every other game in this series) seem to be a small view of the great things that could have come with this game. This game had the potential to be an extremely in-depth geopolitical grand strategy game. Instead, it is a hollow game about military conquest and making money, masked by a clutter of interface options all showing stats of little to absolutely no significance.  This game also feels as if the developers were currently working on a feature, and decided 'HEY! Lets add this!' and completely forgot about the task at hand, or could not be bothered to finish said task. A prime example would be the environment system. You may think, 'Why, there is none!' and you would be mostly right, however with many Society technologies, they all have to do with the environment, and some even have to do with nuclear fallout (another thing that is not to be seen). And some of the techs say, in the 'effects' portion of the tech, 'Environmental rating +x%'. Well, why would they say it has these effects even though most of these techs dont do anything? Well, the answer is simple. The developers were working on environmental effects to your actions and the actions of other nations, and these technologies would help the global environmental situation. And by hints from the technology, nuclear fallout would be an issue too. However, the developers either did one of two things. They either thought 'lets put this in, and this, and this' but never went back to the task at hand (as I said earlier) or had a hard time creating these systems (which I imagine would be complicated) and gave up completely. Not even bothering to remove the technologies that talk about environmental impact, blah, blah, blah.  Also, many (probably a majority) of the technologies have literally no impact. It is literally useless fluff put into the game and branded with a sign saying 'THIS DOES SOMETHING' however, it doesnt. Yes, I grant you there are also MANY technologies that do a lot, however if you look at the grand strategy games put out by Paradox Interactive, every single technology has a large impact and is essential.   And all in all, this game is largely unfinished. The developers did update it years ago, however they still left behind the game, and left it very hollow indeed. They moved on to create THREE new titles, all as hollow as this, but with a shiny new interface, map, and a better AI (which is TERRIBLE in 2020, by the way).  Sure, this game can be fun to play even now. However the bad practices that Battlegoat has proceeded with for 4 games (Not sure about SR2010) should not go unnoticed. Practices such as, leaving behind an unfinished game, using said unfinished features and leaving them in other titles (environmental impact 'modifiers' still implemented in their SR titles to date). I would also rant about how they pulled Supreme Ruler Ultimate from Early Access and 'releasing' it in an extremely unfinished state, however I have a review on that game for you already.  All in all, I would not reccoment anybody to support the bad practices Battlegoat has gone through with many times, and I urge you to turn away from this game and have a look at Paradox Interactive's titles instead. They are very finished, always releasing updates, finishing their games, and have many features. I am sorry Battlegoat but I despise games being left unfinished. Especially 4 games in a row. I would be weary when thinking of buying a game from this company in the future.",
