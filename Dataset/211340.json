            "review_text": "A dating sim for the young witch in all of us! Like Harry Potter, with a liberal dose of anime and without all that uptight britishness that makes me kinda hate it. Also a liberal dose of progressive gender and sexuality, which is always a fun one, and racial politics too. (That said, I was a *little* offput by the 'marriage is kind of a year-long thing' plot point, even if it makes sense in context...)  Don't be fooled - this is mostly a dating/life sim. There are 'dungeons', but they're more obtuse and annoying puzzle roadblocks I could honestly do without. Persona 3/4 this ain't. Also, you have to be a girl, though you have a wide range of options for your love life, three straight and two gay, and a wide variety of other non-romance events. Romance is legitimate and well-handled - the opposite of Bioware's efforts. (Oh god, flashbacks to terrible competing english VN Planet Stronghold DDDDDDD:)  Overall, takes itself just seriously enough not to be a broad parody, but not so much that it's hard to get into or requires heavy investment. (The default character's name is Mary Sue, if that tells you anything.) Highly recommended for anyone who's even a little into the idea, and even better, sequels are on the way!  Sadly, the best character is unromanceable, despite her obviously being open to the idea of a relationship with a student and a lady. :C Oh, Professor Potsdam, how I long for some private lessons with you... ;o; (maybe she's married? i dunno.)",

For my first playthrough, it felt similar to a rogue-like game such as Faster Than Light (with a lot more reading and plot than FTL). Although the dungeons are slightly randomized per playthrough, second and onward playthroughs will be a lot easier than the first, but there's enough plot to warrant at least a couple playthroughs beyond the first.  It's not the longest game ever, but it's not the shortest; it might take you between 2 and 5 hours for your first playthrough, depending on your reading speed. For what it's worth, I enjoyed Magical Diary more than I enjoyed The Stanley Parable.  A 4/5 rating wouldn't go amiss for this game; the major downsides is its relatively short length and 'poor' graphics (they aren't poor, but rather underdeveloped. A bit more detail here and there wouldn't hurt).",

Hm, I've played at least 10 hrs(not 4.2 on record as stated), the other part being offline because somehow launching it via Steam screws it up. I used a  walkthrough  [spikycaterpillar.com]  to power through this game as quickly as possible so I can get on with my other stuff on backlog.  This  [yearbook.spikycaterpillar.com]  is my yearbook page in case someone's interested for whatever reasons.  So...I felt like I was playing some sort of dating sim; you're this freshman girl who goes to this *magical* school to become a witch as you were borned to be. You go to these different coloured classes to learn about magic and spells. Like school, there will be tests to examine how well you know your stuff. There are seven exams in total. Oh and you can also just not go to classes and sleep or gym all week just like in real life. You get $5 allowance each week, and on every Saturday, well most, you can choose to either go shopping like a real girl would or study.  Aside from that, you apparently get to romance with a select few people(or things as some aren't actually human.....).....and that either goes well or it doesn't. I went with that demon dude, who actually looks more like a girl than a guy, but whatever - thought it would be cool to get it *on* with a demon! hahahahaha  But yeah....  If you like reading a lot and dating sims, this is for you! If not, then don't bother. I'm actually neutral on this, but steam wants either a yes or a no, so I'm gonna so yes as the gameplay was fun I suppose...",

It's a little like finding a bizarre Harry Potter fanfiction Choose Your Own Adventure while drunk: at first you feel like you shouldn't be enjoying the experience, but after a while you stop caring.  The game handles itself with a refreshing lack of gravity (the main character's default name is 'Mary Sue,' for gods' sakes), but some of the plotlines and relationships are remarkably smart, well-written affairs. In example, there's a character I will refer to as NotSnape. My character, a girl in her late teens, accidentally got married to NotSnape. I nearly bailed on the game right there, but what followed was a downright heartfelt relationship that did not shy away from how bloody creepy it was.  Some use of walkthroughs/guides is more or less required to see a lot of the content, but given the genre, I can't really hold that against it. I recommend this game, but don't pay too much for it; if it's on sale, give it a go. There's also an excellent demo available (whether on Steam or on the dev website, I forget) that one could try if on the fence.",

There is an amazing sense of character and depth to your choices, skills and spells you bring with you, and the storyline becomes quite amazing in a mostly non-camp way. Yes, there's a sexy guy with demon wings and a grumpy teacher who maybe isn't that bad, and more school conspiracies than you can shake your wand at - but surprisingly, this all makes for a very smooth and immersive ride where choices really matter.  Fleshing out the story are several mini-challenges in form of dungeon runs - and challenge you they will, with proper multiple solutions based on both what spells you have learned so far and your personal player smarts.   Buy this if you have any love for roleplaying games done right, and don't allow yourself to be put up by the anime graphics and the wizard high school setting. You will not regret this purchase.",

I got the game on sale, as I do with most English VNs, during the linux sale for a really good price. The game is made by Hanako games and occasionally they have a sale on their games through their website, and you could probably ask for a Steam code if you buy it through their website, or at least that is how it worked for Long Live the Queen.",

But then, just when you think the game is about to take off and deliver you find yourself looking at your yearbook page and a game-over summary screen. I was quite disappointed upon reaching this point.  But in spite of the early end it was a lot of fun playing. I'm hoping for a sequel or DLC that will continue the story. ",

Through learning magic(or not, if deciding to skip class), you can change how you approach the dungeons you face periodically in the story, leading to a new appeal through each playthrough. As for the routes, every character is very unique, and you may find yourself in twists you did not expect. While there are a select few with more to do than others, I personally found every route to have something worth playing, and added to...well, the magic of Magical Diary.

I've clocked at least eight ways the game can end so far, with a hundred smaller details mixed into those endings.  Experience is marred by none of the characters having truly standout personalities, and a visual style that will be hit-or-miss for you.   But given the price, the one man production team, and the overall quality of the product its still a hit more than a miss.

            "review_text": "This game really scratched my Harry Potter itch, I got it on a humble bundle sale, I forgot how long time ago, I never played it because lets be honest... Magical Diary? Female protagonist? Visual novel? When am I gonna get time in my busy schedule of playing hardcore action rpgs to try this game out?   Well one day I told myself to give every game in my library a shot for 10 mins. So I play the game. Why not make a cute girl while I'm at it? There is decent amount of character customization. I'm happy with my character and I start the game. Bleah, this is a lot like Harry Potter, unoriginal much?... - 10 min later - This game is a lot like Harry Potter, this is amazing!   You got your unique characters, magical holidays and traditions, spells to learn and use in challenges, secrets to unlock, you can follow your own path, the people you befriend help you later on, and the people you cross will remember you for it, balance your magical school work with occasions to make trouble. The story was amazing, cliche? Maybe. Fun and involving? Definitely. You can avoid interactions you do not want, of course there are unskipable events in the game, but I never felt I was being forced on a specific path at any point while playing. There are funny moments, romantic moments and tragic ones, my first ending was... unhappy to put it mildly, it made me stop playing so I can curl up on the bed and be drenched in sadness (I am a 24 year old male).  My only problems with this game are: - the lack of teachers in Iris Academy, there are 2 people... that's it! No nurse, no janitor, no groundskeeper, no porter, no lunch lady, no coach, just 2 teachers. One of them apparently is the headmistress/ janitor/ doctor/ night watchman/ school councilor AND teaches 3 classes, as far as I can tell said 3 classes happen at the same time. - the game is kinda pricey for it's length, buy it on a sale - because of the multiple endings there can be no direct sequel to this title, but there will be a another game with a parallel story in the same setting.  TL;DR Great fantasy visual novel, its few problems don't get in the way of enjoying the game.",

It is replayable, but I have no idea what you'll do after exhausting all of the possible endings (there are a lot though). The puzzles are a little bit weird and are relatively few, but are fun nonetheless. My only concern would be the character customization options, which are a bit too few for a game that's basically a dating sim game, but it's not much of a big deal, I guess.  But damn that opening!

You play as 'Mary Sue', a young wildseed (read: mudblood) witch who has entered a boarding school for magical folk to learn the craft.   My initial impression of Magical Diary is not favourable. On the upside the anime-style character is very customizable, some of the background artwork is nice, and there seem to be a number of different narrative paths that you may take through the game with hints at mysteries to uncover, making for good replay value. On the downside much of the character art is amateurish, and the game does little to hide its fanfiction roots. Because of this you wind up with a narrative that is chock-full of cliches, making the story very predictable. The strategic gameplay also feels overwhelmed at times by the sheer amount of narrative exposition there is to read. It took me almost 30 minutes to get through 2 weeks' worth of decisions, when it should have taken 5 minutes at most.   Bottom Line? This game will not appeal to everyone. If you enjoy reading Harry Potter fanfiction and love visual novel style games you may enjoy playing Magical Diary. Otherwise stay away.",
