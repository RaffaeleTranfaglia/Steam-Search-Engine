            "review_text": "Final Fantasy is back. Again. For the 3rd time. But what's nice is this game is fully optimized to play on new hardware. I won't go into specifics on what Final Fantasy VII is all about, since unless you have been living under a rock, you already know. But for those rock dwellers, I will give some basics. Final Fantasy VII is an epic turn based RPG. One of the finest in its genre. It has a grand story. Memorable characters. An amazing soundtrack. Everything has aged wonderfully, except I'd say the visuals. Luckily with the power of the MOD, you can relive this classic with a fresh spin of the visuals (just search around) giving you a new experience on this gem. The only problem with modding FFVII is that you will need to roll back the exe which will in turn disable any achievements. So I'd suggest for achievement hunters that you play through the game unmodded. And replay it later with the beautiful mods added.   With that said, aside from better new system support, this re-release of FFVII also adds a higher res for the included character designs, as well as cloud saving, and a mode which will increase HP and Gil, with a seemingly tedious process. The latter mode is completely optional, but works in a way which does not hamper any enemy level scaling. It only boosts HP/MP, and not any stats or levels. So you will get the same scaling flow you would when playing it normally. This however does mess with your limit meter. So use at your own risk.    either way, FFVII is a great classic. Fans of it originally should check out this re-release. And newcomers need to experience this at least once in their lives.",

I still havent completed this game due to buying many games and never completing them, but sometime in the future I plan to go back to this game and finish it.  My Experience so far (No Spoilers): So far with my experience with this game has been great, the gameplay is fluid which you have turns attacking in real time with the classic Final Fantasy gameplay, idk about you but I really like these old poly graphics which have a charm and a place in my heart ;), story wise this game has a lot of climatic moments which makes you keep on playing more and has 3 discs which you don't have to switch since when you get to a certain point you can save and quit or continue. I'm really happy I decided to buy this game because, it holds a special place in one of my favorite games and perhaps my favorite rpg but, if you still haven't bought this game buy it, period.   Also does anyone have recommedations for another good FF game because, I would like to play more FF games and Im becoming more and more drawn to the series.",

The PC port is amazing. The original soundtrack was replaced with a newer soundtrack, and the graphics were also dramatically improved. I, personally, did not enjoy the music that was put into the PC port of this. However, with the aid of mods, I was able to replace the PC soundtrack with the classic PS1 soundtrack. The PC port also offers 3 different graphics choices, depending on the preferences of the user. The user can choose between the PS1 graphics, or the PC graphics, as well as a mod that gives combat 3D graphics. One downside of this game, is the fact that you have to create a Square Enix account to play. This was a disappointment for me, but not enough to keep me from playing it. Aside from the technical aspects of this game, the gameplay is amazing. This is by far, the best game I have ever owned, because of the great story, the great soundtrack, the amazing combat, and the replayability. After spending over 500 hours on this game over three different game systems, I won't be stopping any time soon. I highly recommend FFVII, and honestly, this game is worth much more than $11.99.",

I have had to use the cmd quite a few times to exit the game because of a bug that does not even allow you to properly close the application.  The game itself is quite well done and the remade graphics are noticeable. I am hellbent on the idea that the game will forever stay as one of the most prominent examples of how to effectively make an RPG: its plot will make you laugh, make you cry and will give you the goosebumps too, all of this while you enjoy the work of one of the most outstanding maestros of videogame score design.

Even though it's really old, it tried to do some easy render-sequences and if you want to the graphics are, with some know-how and troubleshooting, fully modable (be careful with spoilers while doing so).

The materia and stat systems are created very well, and the game has around 50 hours of gameplay. This may not be a big deal today for an RPG but in 1997, the reaction to that was: Holy â¥â¥â¥â¥.

With a story better than any film, that is both tragic and at times wonderfully frivolous and off the wall, the emotional dynamism of this game makes it an all time classic. It changed my life in more than one way - Nobuo Uematsu's timeless score, with it's clever variations on the main theme, was my inspiration to follow a career in music.  I've finished the game at least 20 times in almost as many years, and every time I look at the game in a different way. It is as relevant emotionally and politically now as it ever was. If you've never played it before, it's not too late. And if you have, then seeing it spruced up is a great experience. Could Squeenix have tried harder to make this a more unique experience? Absolutely. Is the DRM a nuisance? Some say it is - I haven't had a problem yet but I do fundamentally have a problem with the idea of DRM. So Squeenix definitely lose points for that.

However, the music has been replaced, the original MIDI soundtrack is now the same music used in the Playstation release, and the game overall has been optimized to run on new systems. The actual game mechanics and combat system are solid, and the story is also still good. If you've never played the game, don't come in expecting something that can stack up to a game released today in terms of graphical quality. If you can look past its age there's still a great game and plenty of time to be wasted in it, though. If you're looking for a nostalgia kick then it's definitely worth the price as well. The only detractor from what's overall a good game is the extra layer of DRM, requiring a Square Enix account, but considering it can be activated with your Steam account and ignored once you set it up the first time, it's hardly a hassle.",

The game itself is the same as it was when it was released, just with technical upgrades.  Essentially this is an updated copy of the FF7 PC release (which I own and have played through several times). The original used a very old version of Apple's QuickTime product, had a max resolution of 640x480 (double the PS1) but ran almost flawlessly. Also, since the code and save game setup work the same...well...you can edit the PC saved games with editors....you know...in case you don't want to spend a large portion of game time breeding magic riding chickens (Chocobos).  This version appears to also use QuickTime (I'm assuming a newer version). The resolution can go pretty high, although keep in mind while the graphics may scale, the models have not been touched. It still looks exactly the same. Keyboard controls can be customized to whatever keys you want, and there is joystick support as well. It also seems to run smoother than the old PC version, both in cutscene and actual play. Also the intro cutscene has been modified slightly since it includes the Square Enix logo instead of just the old Squaresoft brand.  Square Enix (formerly Square/Squaresoft) requires login/registration (sigh) to their site/account manager to register the game and provide extra features (just like Ewwbisoft) but also just like Ubisoft, you supposedly can play offline after the initial registration. Not sure yet whether or not that means FF7 can't be played under Steam's sharing setup, but since AC4 doesn't work, there's a chance this one won't either.",

Why not finish this game so I don't get any spoilers from the video!' It jurastically changed from that. I couldn't stop playing. It's like it was sucking me into this game. Although if it weren't for the PS1 music patch for this game, I wouldn't be here and playing this version, because I would be playing on the PS1 (but if I would have, it would take years because I never get on my PS1 on a daily basis). The graphics are a step up, and if you see a side-by-side comparison of the original vs this one, you only see that the character models are more high-def, and the pre-rendered graphics are displayed in a better resolution. Other than that, there is no difference gameplay-wise, except for the SUPER-OP character booster. What it does is that it makes any 3 of your characters in your party right now have 9999 hp and 999 mp (I'm not sure on the gil, it wasn't 99,999 but it was like 60,000 or something like that) other than that, it doesn't give you status buffs, nothing else. Just that (preety weird if you ask me, but you know, Square Enix will make anything worse *Puts on sunglasses*). It will also feel weird the first times using the keyboard, and I have found some mini-games unplayable when using my layout (A is OK, B is CANCEL, D is MENU, Space for START, Shift for SWITCH, Page Up and Down for left and right bumpers 'PS1 controller') and it is real nice that you can use an XBOX 360 controller even though I don't have one, I just use my PS3 controller and have some software to emulate the 360 (I'm not going in-depth about that). You can also use a PS2 controller, but you need an adapter (the best way to play if you ask me, but again, I don't have an adapter).

The variation in scenery, the number of side activities, the secrets and the challenges keep this game alive for days longer than the main story (which is fairly large in it's own right as it is).  Every Final Fantasy fan has their favourite and I'm not going to argue with anyone that doesn't agree; I have played and continue to play every one of the main series titles I can lay my hands on and although each of them has their charms I would still rate VII as my first choice.

I am really glad that Square Enix re released this classic game for the pc so I defenitly reccomend this game if you liked the final fantasy 13 series on xbox 360 and ps3 just try and make sure u dont have onions next to u while watching some of the emotional bits in the game!

            "review_text": "Final Fantasy VII is a special game, there basically none like it.Not for its history but there are not as much potential games being made like it, not enough games with its ambition or originality. It transcends all of what is expected and surpasses all basically. This game is not overrated or neutral in my book, in fact it is indeed considered underrated now for me, itâs been a while since people experience itâs raw power but it is still is to this day one of the best games ever made. . Of course the stands of its title as the best game ever made are still pretty known yet dismissed which is very sad because this is an overachiever of an experience ESPECIALLY compared with the rest of its series and many of the genres. Itâs faster than what its series is normally is; its gameplay is simpler and funnier, having personally one of the best mechanics ever, the materia. Especially considering this is one of the best games Iâve played I recommend it to anyone really. Itâs just a nice smooth experience even if you arenât the type to play big games to the end; I really recommend this, even I someone who cannot support this type of length it is still a game that every second manages to show me something cool. It is basically my saving grace on long JRPGs and perhaps video games in general. The gameplay is one of the most mechanically best Iâve seen, simple and straight to the point unlike many other games that take a long time to get to the basic of it, this one gives you it all at full front and doesnât hesitate to make it entertaining at all times. Magic is simple to use by any character using the materia system which is the best system ever, theyâre these little magic pearls that once equipped within your weapon can be used, they can also be combined with slots that are combined slots which you can make combos with such as (A âCureâ materia with an âAllâ materia makes it possible to use that magic on all). On top of this the materia can be leveled up as you battle to be more efficient by gaining , not only this, all characters within the game are extremely useful even without the power to equip any materia you wish from battle power to healing! Every character has a Limit Break which is when they get hit a couple of times and canât take it anymore, they will release a power blow that is mostly based on their characteristic, for example Tifa Lockhart will use wrestling moves done by a roulette a system, and Aerisâs first limit will be to give some health to the 3 of your team.  The entire gameâs backgrounds are made with these amazingly animated CGI pictures that are filled with detail and are always cool to look at, it has beaten any texture or tile pack in its genre of how memorable and incredible itâs visuals are. Not only that but a fair share of interactive cutscenes blending in with the gameâs models, an insane amount of in-battle animations with over a thousand enemies with their unique attack patterns and styles and in general lots of effort put into to the limit.  I used to dislike this game due to my short attention span I grew to notice how much it has to offer especially compared to others of the genre; it has indeed a wider variation of options while remaining simple and straight to the point, from dialog, to character selection, to how many weapons and powers you can acquire, different styles to take on an enemy entirely there are various choices to do on side missions side too and you can collect rare items as you explore a giant world, collect more, experiment with powers, there are multiple statues that are negative and positive, a round of elemental powers given to about anything in the game including actual weapons you receive, accessories that facilitate you by nullifying certain types of times and just a huge number of other statistics that yes while describing seems complex but seems very natural and simple within the game, all this to discover new ways to make gameplay easier and this is all done in a balanced manner quickly.. Itâs a bit long to go into detail about each content you can go to but as an example thereâs a materia that allows you to turn enemies into items.  The plot is amazingly crafted and designed; it is filled with foreshadowing, flashbacks and not an adventure that manages to keep continuing without any breaks and always a bigger goal in front. Out though yes everything within the game is almost as If a satire of how simple it is, mostly everything is based of clichÃ©s and yes itâs mostly comical and never 100% reassured (I mean c,mon by this point you would tell yourself âOh I guess the magic goop heals all of the plotâs woundsâ to be honest or âMust be symbolicâ because really Itâs a just science fantasy with a more serious turn), but that only comes within the standards of nitpicking, I mean honestly, if you were to go to the single first bone of this game realistically you would think to yourself âIsnât ecoterrorism flawed?â, but donât worry they later on in the game kind of regrets what he did to save the planet SO HEY Plot filling exists at a high level in this game, this game can truly sustain itself in terms of plot elements sometimes even if itâs silly so Iâll end it at that considering thereâs many other silly major plot concentrations that can be easily taken away in a bad way if you donât see it from the adventurous perspective or ATLEAST EXPLORE THEM! Whatâs there is there, itâs a simple story within a typical cyberpunk sceneario and Iâm more than ok with that, other than that the implied adult themes are strongâ¦ And the adult themes that are straight up shown are STRONG TOO! This game is still pretty grimdark to this day, it was the first of the series to introduce real issues such as poverty, world pollution, life goals, what death means to a person and how to live with it amongst other deep contents in which the game casually comments on with a quote or 2, perhaps even an entire character built on the topic. Some may complain on how it tries to deep but for me itâs more the merrier, it isnât the best psychological take on characters but it certainly isnât the worst, especially compared with what Japanese media takes as âPsychologicalâ it could BE WAY worse. Either way I appreciate itâs psychological tones it gives the plot way much depth and it doesnât deliver itself at first glance, anyone against it must REALLY hate people with actual personalities that are basically perfect cardboard main characters, again itâs balanced because the characters themselves are competent, which is needlessly to say the necessary for a character, outside of that you can have your emotional problems as long as you use it to power yourself within your journey, I give this long speech about character development because IT SEEMS This HAS BEEN DONE WRONG MANY TIMES and Final Fantasy VII manages to do it alright. This is THE adventure, the most over achieving product in history, this game manages to hold my attention in all of the aspects it gives, a great and full of effort game that has grown out to be known as the best game ever made numerous times, it comes with a dark well designed plot filled with numerous great characters, itâs silly, humorous and memorable, itâs filled to the brim with content which is all amazingly crafted (which honestly is the reason why I fear this review might be TOO basic to cover up the entire game), there are 4 hour long documentaries which document every aspect, nook and cranny from this full of experience game. I mean it doesnât seem much like it but Iâm actually trying to refrain myself from writing more than a book here considering there is so much to comment on! This is my Final Fantasy.

Use the Windowed mode instead. Also you need to specifically enable the cloud saving feature as it defaults to off, and make sure your controller (if you use one) is compatible with (and is set to the mode for, if a dual mode unit) XINPUT, not DirectInput (although it's an old game and you might expect it to use DirectInput, SE HAS updated it to use the modern Xinput system and DirectInput won't quite work right!).",

It makes the battles feel more dynamic as well as strategic. The Materia system is really cool as well, and, in fact, I might prefer it more than the old 'your character gets to learn these specific spells'; in this game, you can equip your characters with whatever magic/summon/command you like, not to mention that the Materia that doesn't fall in those categories can provide different bonuses to your character.

And even today I remember this one as a shiny gem, the best of the Final Fantasy series. But thats just my opinion soaked with a lot of nostalgia whenever I play it.  So, whats this game about? You are Cloud Strife, an EX-'Soldier',who used to work for Shinra, the world biggest corporation. Shinra's only interest is to suck as much 'Mako'-energy out of the planet as possible and use it to increase their power. So you end up with a group called 'Avalanche' to oppose them. Cloud does not seem to care much about this at first - his reason to 'join' Avalanche is referable to Tifa Lockhart, a childhood friend - but as you progress in the game, you will end up on a big journey facing a threat much bigger than Shinra.  The graphics are a little bit outdated, even the once beautiful backgrounds did not age to well, but the story and the amazing soundtrack do more than compensate for the graphics. You can also download some textures for the characters if you like to, which will make them look pretty impressive (Check the community-hub). Final Fantasy 7 can be played with a keyboard but I find it much more comfortable to play with a controller. The 360-pad works fine but I recommend a keybinder like JoytoKey (freeware) so you can use all of your buttons and bind everything to your needs.  Steam is actually selling it for 12.99â¬ and let me ensure you; totally worth it! It's extremely easy to put 100h+ into the game. First there is the main story, I think it took me about 60h back then. But there is much more to do(and discover) in between or at the end of the game including sidequests, hidden materias(magic) and items,breeding chocobos, some kind of RTS-battlefield and the Gold saucer; a huge theme park with attractions, minigames and an arena to test your skills.   My final verdict: If you are into RPG's Final Fantasy 7 is a must have. For everyone else, if you judge a game just by it's graphics you might get disappointed otherwise give it a try (battles can be fought in ATB or turn-based). The only downside is,that you have to register at Square-Enix to play the game. It sure get's a little bit annoying nowadays to create an account for every single publisher to play their games but atleast it is not a huge program, just create an account, check the mail and you are ready to go. Took 5 minutes for me.",

A compelling turn-based JRPG that redefined gaming in 1997 and ushered in a new era for groundbreaking RPG's. It is still arguably the best Final Fantasy game ever made.   On a platform with so few quality turn based JRPGs, this one stands out as diamond in the rough.    The characters are some of the most memorable in the franchises' history, and the battle system still stands as a prime example for turn based RPG's in general.    This PC version is a updated port of the original 1998 PC release. It features 36 unlockable achievements, cloud saves, and a character booster feature. It can also be played in full 1920/1080 resolution. However, it's difficult to recommend this version if you already own the PS1 version.    Absolutely no JRPG/RPG fan should be without this in their collection...   HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!! ",

If you're already a FF fan and you just want to relive the old games without digging out a PS1, this is certainly a brilliant way to go. And if you're not already a FF fan, you should be. I'd reccomend starting with FFVI, VII, or VIII. And for anyone younger folk who've played pokemon, this is kinda like that but with much more depth. It's just better all around. (Don't hate me for drawing those parallels, they're definitely there.)  Also, DO NOT play it with a keyboard. Only way to properly play anf FF is to plug in a gamepad.   Get the game. It's great.",

            "review_text": "Final Fantasy VII (or Final Fantasy 7 for some people) is one of the most highly loved and rated games of all time, and while currently playing through it on Steam I have fallen in love with it all over again. The story was groundbreaking back in 1997 filled with memorable set-pieces and cutscenes, and while some scenes have lost their impact over the years (a certain scene comes to mind immediately ) the story still has some amazing plot twists and turns. The characters are fantastic for the most part, the only one I don't like being the main antagonist Sephiroth who really just has Mommy issues. Cloud is a very relatable character who goes through a lot of changes over the course of the game, questioning himself, his choices and even his own existance. Tifa is bubbly and always trying to make the situation right, Barrett is just downright hilarious, Red XIII is a mysterious creature who wants to return home, Cait Sith is a character who has more relevance to the plot than you may initially think, Aerith is a tragic story of Almost making it, Yuffie is a loli-trap who is actually a character with more to her than meets the eye, Vincent is badass and Cid is the greatest incarnation of the character in the entire Final Fantasy series. Let us not forget the addicting gameplay too, with an infinite amount of customization due to the Materia system, which assigned Spells/Commands/Summons etc. to characters.The graphics are outdated yes, but the world Final Fantasy VII is set in has an undeniable charm and atmosphere to it. Midgar is one of my favourite locations in any video game ever! Let us not forget the amazing soundtrack composed by Nobou Uematsu. Right from the get-go, the soundtrack of Final Fantasy VII is amazing. From the Opening~Bombing Mission to the classic One-Winged Angel, FFVII has one of the all-time best soundtracks to any game ever made. In fact, Final Fantasy VII would be my favourite game ever if it were not for the brilliant Tales of Xillia, but that's something I'll delve into if it ever gets a (very unlikely) release on Steam. FFVII is a classic that should not be missed or pre-judged on it's poor graphical presentation. This game changed the RPG genre forever and is one of the all time greats.  9/10",

The story just twists so many times during the game it really makes it the masterpiece that is I mean how many games do this now for example you start off blowing up a reactor for some miletent group for it only to twist and then your doing something else for it to twist again and again and this is what keeps this games story fresh.  You get one main objective Sephiroth but it's not as easy you think and during that journey your meet and help people along the way again there are some fantastic moments of story twists that just keep you wanting more, for me play after school only to be playing for hours in to the late hours. You will get a lot of people saying this isn't the best one of the series and I except that it's personal preference but if you've never played this game of the series the re done PC version on here is worth buying (wait for sale if you want) and playing since it's had it's music fixed it's exactly like the PS1 version.  If there is one thing I do miss about the first time I played this game is the feeling of what's going to happen next I've played it over and over in the last 15 yrs and I never get bored as I try to change the way I play but I would kill for that experience again of playing the game the first time back when I was 15.",

Final Fantasy VII plays through your emotions by telling an intricate story about life, love, loss, confusion, revenge, and death. The simple (almost lego) character models provided a challenge that we don't really worry about these days: The characters had to express emotions using body language (no facial expressions). [Slight spoiler incoming] You can literally see the rage coursing through Barrett as he watches his hometown get destroyed. I find this form of expression refreshing compared to the perfectly rendered expressions in videogames these days. It makes it a bit difficult to empathize sometimes. But do your best- it's worth it!  Also, the polygons and twisty winding maps leave a LOT to the imagination- which is a good thing. Imagination is a form of thought that games have been slowly eliminating through our advances in detail. That's not to say I wouldn't want this game to be remade in beautiful stunning detail- I'm all for it! It would be like reading a book -then watching the movie and saying, 'Holy â¥â¥â¥â¥, they cast Ender PERFECTLY!!' -rather than skipping the book, watching the movie and thinking it had some cool concepts~  The real beauty in the game is a combination of the writer's inspiration and what they had to work with. The writers poured their hearts into making this game- they had no idea it would be such a hit. All they had were crummy PS1 graphics to work with, but they did what they could hoping people would like it. Nowadays, game devs have more than enough money and the writers are getting less and less passionate because of it. The Final Fantasy franchise has been going pretty strong and can still give me a good cry sometimes. But why was 7 such a hit? I'm thinking it was sincerity.  Something else that comes to mind is how the mini games weave into the standard gameplay like they ARE the standard gameplay. A player is expected to adapt on the fly~ One moment you're fighting in a turn based system, then suddenly you're on a motorcycle swatting baddies on either side! Don't forget snowboarding, chocobo races, and other golden saucer attractions!   ----------------------- SPOILER ALERT - personal feelings First time through (I'm talking 12 years old), I put all my time into Aeris. Her limit ability heals your entire party, so naturally she was my 'white mage'! I thought she'd be there forever- we dated and everything! I cried so many tears of sadness because of it. *sobs -----------------------  If you haven't played the game, I recommend it. The story is stellar; each character shares a bit of the spotlight.

There's also the character booster, which is kind of a neat extra, though it depends on the cloud saving system. There are also achievements. Aside from these small value adds though, nothing seems to have been changed since the original PC port, including the inferior MIDI soundtrack from the PC version. The game can be modded to fix that and other things, but there's a catch; doing so will prevent you from using cloud saves (the system rejects any save made in a format it doesn't expect), character booster (which depends on the cloud saves), or achievements. So if you intend to mod the game to make it look better or to bring back the original soundtrack or whatever, you lose everything that Square Enix added and may as well look up the original PC port.  The game is good (of course, it's FFVII), but it sucks that Square Enix made such little effort on this new version and made it impossible to update yourself without losing the only things they did add. Another problem is that it doesn't allow you to map the D-pad on your controller to movement keys. It supports the analog stick, but it's almost unusable. I had to download Xpadder and map the D-pad to arrow keys for the controller to be a functional control scheme.  tl;dr: good game, bad port",

I've never played FF7 before, so I decided to buy the steam version to see all the hype!  And honestly, this game does not live up to all the hype people say it does. It's not a bad game, IT'S NOT BAD, it's good, but after hearing all the amazing things about this game, I was disappointed.  What the game does well: The gameplay is tight, you control 3 characters in your turned based style, each weapon has slots for items called materia. Materia give you access to spells and abillities, so you're gonna be hunting down a lot of these! The world itself is vast and there's A LOT to do. Once you get an airship the game becomes less linear and you're free to go where you wish. Before that, you'll be following the story mainly. The combat can get repetitive though, but it's an RPG so it's not surprising. There's a wide variety of characters to play as, but you have to keep Cloud in the party. The limit breaks look good too. Also, the music in this game is beautiful.  What the game doesn't do well: Some of the main cast are mediocre characters, very mediocre. HOWEVER, Vincent, Cid, Aeris, Yuffie and Tifa are awesome. On the other hand, you have Cloud-who is shallow, boring and just nothing like he's hyped up by fans of this game to be. He never takes charge of anything, his dialogue is usually just a generic response to someone else. His character development is kind of lame too. Cait Sith is hands down one of the worst, most annoying characters I've ever seen in a game. I don't know why Square decided to make Vincent optional, but have Cait Sith be in the main cast. The story itself is a wild goose chase to stop Sephiroth from destroying the world, but he's just a lame villain. Honestly, he has mommy issues, all he does is yammer on about her. His motivations are poorly explained too. The backstories for some of the main cast are lame too, I couldn't care for Cait, Barret or Red at all.  The animations for summons in this game take a fairly long time, which is frustrating. The idea of Sephiroth being an all power soldier goes down the drain at the end of the game too. I don't want to spoil too much.  I don't recommend this game tbh, it's really underwhelming.   ",

            "review_text": "This review contains no spoilers [I think], although you probably already know the big one.  Wow. Where do you even start with a review for a game like this? For some this is the greatest RPG ever made. For some this is probably the greatest game ever made. For some this is an overrated piece of garbage that has been getting far more attention than it deserved and just happened to come along at the right time.  I'm going to cop-out and say the answer is somewhere in the middle. Sorry.  I am not normally an RPG gamer. Whilst I like games with deep, involving stories, I generally don't have the patience for RPGs, preferring adventure games, whether point-and-click, action-adventure or even visual novels. My main dislikes of RPGs are the enormous time-sinks they can be - case in point I'm currently 55 hours into FFVII and still have some way to go - and the fact you can spend so much of this time grinding. I think roughly 15 of my 55 hours have been spent actively seeking out specific random encounters in the hope of finding certain rare items, levelling up or reaching higher Limit Breaks.  But I do have a weak spot for FFVII. Perhaps it's the blend of traditional hack'n'slash RPG story with a dystopian sci-fi twist. Perhaps it's the fact that the game itself is a deconstruction of then-cliched JRPG stereotypes [a fact that bypassed many because it was in fact their /first/ encounter with a JRPG]. Perhaps it just came along at the right time and was so massively popular that it was impossible to ignore. Maybe it's all of the above.  Just because something is popular doesn't mean it panders to the lowest common denominator. This is not an easy game. This is not a straight-forward game. Conversely, just because it's popular doesn't mean it's brilliant. The plot is at times difficult to follow [good luck finding the keystone on your first playthrough without either a guide or blind luck]. The game does require a lot of investment in order to get much reward.  I really do like this game. There you go. SIx paragraphs in and you get the opinion. I've bought FFVII 3 times - for the PS1, the PC [I wish I'd kept it - apparently it's quite collectable now] and now the Steam release. Whilst it isn't a game you can play for just half an hour here and there, it is something that I want to play through every few months just for the sheer experience.  Quite a lot of the negative reviews seem to focus on the fact that this game hasn't aged well. That isn't really the fault of the developers, who were struggling to produce a game that would run on the N64 before throwing in the towel and moving in with Sony. And no, it hasn't been remastered. You get the original PC release with a few tweaks here and there. If you want a remake, go and hassle Square-Enix. Yes, the backgrounds are blocky and the characters are made with laughably few polygons. There are mods out there [apparently] that change the character models, the music and suchlike. Use them if you want. For me, the appearance is part of the charm.  Things I like about FFVII: The battle mechanics: there are plenty of customisation options without ever feeling completely overwhelmed and the materia system works brilliantly. The story and the characters: when I first played FFVII back on release day [yes] I had never encountered such deep, complicated feelings in a video game. Frustration, anxiety, betrayal, the subject of mental illness, courage, determination, romance, shame, resentment, longing, hope and euphoria. Everything is here. You ask a player if they cried at the end of disc one. If they say no, they're probably lying [Actually, I was already blubbing thanks to Seto]. But that's the important thing. You wouldn't have such deep emotional involvement with a character if you'd only been introduced to them half-an-hour ago. The game is long and winding enough you get swept along for the ride and really feel for them all. Well, mostly. I never much cared for Cait Sith... You'll probably hate Yuffie if you somehow miss Wutai and her backstory. Oh, and the music is amazing.  Things I don't like about FFVII: The save system is a little annoying, but bear in mind this was made for a console and as such the save files had to be kept a reasonable size. It can take a while for the story to get going, but you'll be glad when it does. The massive J-turn when you are captured by Shina and wake up in the middle of the night to discover... well, you'll see... The 'super-deformed' look is a little baffling, perhaps only from a Western point of view. But I find it quite jarring when many of the in-game FMVs use much more detailed models.  Just a couple of points now. This Steam version is based on the PC version released in (I think) 1998. The original PC version fixed many of the faults of the PS1 version, including: Increase in resolution [character models only - backgrounds are still low-res], increase in number of saves [from 15 per card to 150] and many of the glaring translation errors have been fixed [except for the syntax error which lets many first timers get killed by the scorpion]. Unfortunately they replaced the PS1s tracker module music with horrible MIDI sounds. The Steam version takes this, replaces the MIDI with recordings of the PS1 music, allows you to customise the control layout, adds achievements and a few other bits and pieces.  So, in conclusion, if you like RPGs, buy it to see what all the fuss is about. If you're an avid gamer but have somehow never played it, buy it to see what all the fuss is about. Just be prepared to put the time in. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to have another stab at Emerald WEAPON....  Be warned that if you buy this game you have to register an account with SquareEnix and link it to your Steam account. This only has to be done the first time you play - after that you don't have to be logged in to play. Oh, and whilst it supports cloud saving, do so at your own risk. It seems to be broken and people complain about losing saves. And when you're 60 hours in, that could be devastating...",

I can now testify after finally beating it that the game fully deserves its praise.

I still highly recommend you play it, but perhaps consider using a guide (jegged offers a fantastic walkthrough).   In addition to that--and I know I'm going to get some hardcore FF7 fans in a fit after saying this-- if you are mostly interested in experiencing the story , consider using the included character booster. It only boosts HP, MP and Gil. All other stats are left as is, so you still have to fight and level up. It simply accelerates the process.  And that's not all. Consider downloading a trainer (there's one called Ochu) to turn on/off random battles at will. I think many people will agree that random battles, though once a normal element in classic JRPGs, are now considered to be quite annoying. Ain't nobody got time for that.  If you're the type of person that wants to just get from point A to B without fighting 20 battles on the way, you'll be grateful for this feature. You can turn them back on at any time and grind up the XP you may have missed on your own terms.  Of course if you want the original experience, then just play the game as is.

I don't mind poor graphics that come from a different era; Half Life, Cave Story, and Phantasy Star 4 still rank as some of my favorite games, not to mention Minecraft. I don't mind the occasional odd translation either; again Phantasy Star 4. I can handle cosmetic flaws.  What I can't handle is the lack of character and cohesive narrative. After playing through this game twice, I still don't feel like I really know any of the characters, or why they did any of the things they did, including the villain. Everyone seems to love putting Sephiroth on various sorts of Top Whatever Villains Ever lists, but I found him hilarious at literally every appearance. Presumably it's because he killed an important character, but I felt like I didn't know her. I was not sad, only confused, because the game never made me like her before it killed her.  After playing this game twice all the way through and using a few guides to make sure I wasn't just missing some bonus third of it somehow, I am left with a wanderlust that this game was supposed to satisfy, after being hyped to heaven and back by the rest of the world as some kind of classic. I am left with this, and questions. Questions like why was Sephiroth going to all the places that he was going to? Why did he attack that ship, or impale that giant snake? Why are there so many minigames that appear only once? What was the point of this or that chapter, this or that boss, and so on.   Nothing in this game world makes sense, but not in a way that I can even get angry at it for being poorly written. Like I said, it doesn't feel poorly written, it feels unfinished, like it's an abridged version of its own story, like it's the Video Game version of a book or show or movie that was poorly adapted. Phantasy Star 4 came out before this game and that game's story and characters kick this one's â¥â¥â¥ around the block and then steal their seats on the train.   Watch a let's play, and read Obstinate Melon's comic version on Deviantart, it is once again without sarcasm the better telling. Though unfortunately at time of writing this review, said comic remains unfinished.  A friend of mine who loved this game to death got me to play it. After I was finished, I discussed it with him and he couldn't defend it at all, and couldn't tell me why he liked it to begin with when I asked. If you'd like to put forward an argument for this game's quality, leave a comment and I will not read it.",

It is a hybrid of fantasy and reality, with an industrialized/modern world meeting beasts and untamed lands. This game is however relatively dated (although some elements stand the test of time), but it is a must for any JRPG fan, as it offers traditional turn based combat, an intuitive magic (materia) system, lots of 'sidequests', a strong narrative and an open world to explore. This game captivated me when it was first released, and even to this day continues to do so. Final fantasy VII also uses humor throughout the game, and gives you 'options' with how to handle scenarios in the game, which impact the world, it is therefore a game you will find yourself playing again and again to revisit events and experience other paths (albeit all leads to same game ending). The cast of characters is colorful as well, and they have become iconic in their own rights. This game is designed with the 'traditional' JRPG elements of the time, something not often seen today, as such it is worth exploring for both fans and the untested alike. Overall this game is a full recommendation, its style may not be for all, but it is a relatively accessible and enjoyable gaming experience and it is priced appropriately, giving you a substantial amount of game (30+ hours easily).",

            "review_text": "Most overrated video game of all time This game did not change rpgs forever, it didnt inspire new design, Every rpg since Final Fantasy 7 that has taken inspiration from a past rpg has taken it from older games like FF6, crono triger, diablo, mother, Zelda, secret of mana, crystalist and Dragon quest. Not once from Final fantasy 7. Ff7 was not the first game with a complicated plot with sad scenes, many games like mother had before it.  The music in this game is the most rememorable aspect of it, but with that said I feel that it's at most times to depressing. People may find it cheery and uplifting and while I find it uplifting I know many others who finds the games score a mood breaker.  The party system is broken and heres why. The magic system broke the game for me and breaks the fundamental aspects of rpgs in general, there are 9 characters in the game and all of them don't matter, there identity is broken because any character can at any time use any spell without work. Materia stones can be equiped to your characters and thats how you get magic, each stone is a new spell and each stone gains it's own indivisual exp stat (called AP). Without consequence I can transfer a high level materia from one character to another, people find this convient but I ask you. Why should I switch party members if they can all do the same thing. There is no startategy in this system what so ever! In previous games like Final Fantasy 6 you would work for each characters stat with the game not babying you, you had to strategically choose your party members and how you leveled each one up or else you could bottleneck them. Each character had traits and a identity that no other character shared, they had abilitys and stats that made them a indispensable asset to specific situations. Each character complimenting anothers play style, letting you form strategy based off team work. The dungeons became complex and funner then anything else in the game because you could form multiple partys to crawl through the dungeon, assigning them just right to ensure each party could remain strong and independent. In 7 no characters have abilitys that make them unuiqe or helpfull, why the heck should I switch out barret for Yuffie? Her text strings are annoying and she offers no added battle benifet, but why should I keep Barret then? I mean Barrets the same blank slate as Yufie! Well I guess it doesnt matter then! Well whatever you do don't bother using Aries because she'll just die!  Which brings me to the story, it's stupid. It's about a stuck up show off jerk who ran away from being a soldier for a undisclosed reason (Revealed latter) and joins a rebellion against a capitialistic corporation using the planets life force to power a city called midgar. You meet many annoying characters who join your party and the game quickly becomes a typical saturday morning cartoon of following the villain from town to town, finding new magic and items and exploring new linear areas until the hippy flower girl aries dies and you realize her dying is a plot device simply to get the main character to have a sex scene with the far less interesting and far less intelligent bar girl who has bigger boobs, I'm not kidding even the developers have come out and said 'When making Final fantasy 7 aries was created before Tifa and it became a internal dispute which girl cloud should end up with, one designer joked 'Let's kill off Aries.'' And they all went with it simply because the japanese perverts enjoyed starring at Tifa more. This story gets more stupid though, it turns our our hero cloud is a mutated side effect of making the most powerfull soldier and that the villain was the only one who came out of the test becomming the most powerfull or whatever and so you and him are basically mindless clones or whatever. So Cloud goes insane, realizes he went his whole adult life lying to Tifa and everyone else about ever being a soldier because he wanted to be more like his role model Zack. Zack is a model clone of cloud with black hair who was on the games villain sepiroths soldier squad back when sepiroth was a 'good guy', Zack is also clouds obsession and homo sexual interest, so when Zack dies cloud steals his identity. I'm not making this junk up, who could! It's at this point that you realize the chick magnet sepiroth we have been chasing for 25 hours of the game is a clone and that the real sepiroth has been frozen since Cloud wounded him in the past, this ticks every logical thinking gamer off because you also put togother that Sepiroith has zero lines of dialogue outside of flash back sequences in the entire game, THATS RIGHT, BECAUSE THE CLONE ISNT THE REAL VILLAIN YOU NEVER HEAR A WORD OUT OF THE GAMES ACTUAL VILLAIN OUTSIDE OF A PAST TENSE. IF THAT ISNT ENOUGH TO SET YOU OFF THEN JUST KEEP READING. The motive of Sepiroth is known by everyone, he wants to become God right? He wants to wound earth so he can become it. That sounds pretty epic and it would be if it wasnt for the fact that his real motive is that he's a mommys boy, and this is when I'm about to set eevery ff7 fan on fire with rage by saying... Sepiroth is no different from Jason Voorhees in the friday the 13th films, there both annoying mute mommas boys who listen to what there mother says without thought of there actions and have super human strength. That's right, I just compared the beloved Final Fantasy 7 to the laughed upon Friday the 13th movie series. If that isnt bad enough I'll step it up alittle by saying that Sepiroth desires to become the planet to be one with his dead alien mother, which is suggested in the game itself. You just let all of that sink in there. I could go on with the story but feel I've said enough, I'll end this section with the games 2 most disturbing scenes, the first being the scene where cloud becomes a cross dresser and enters a hotel where oiled up body builders undress and walk into a hot tub where they ask cloud how it feels and he replies 'It hurts'. Need I add in that this is a optional easter egg, making us all wonder who would go out of there way to unlock and trigger this filth. And yes, I would still find this equaly disturbing if it was abunch of girls getting in the tub with Cloud. The next scene involves aries being trapped in a prison with a Dog wolf character so the evil scientist can get aries pregant with a wolf cetra baby because aries is a cetra and this wolf is the last of his race as well. The scenes cut short and the wolf wants no part in it but still, this happend..  The eviorments in this game are often lacking in life and character, there bleek and distraught. Which is what this game is going for because the earth is dying and I get that, but it doesnt change the fact that the music, art, characters and story follow the same distraught and doomed feeling. I don't need rainbows to be happy, but when every aspect is dark it becomes life draining. The camera and texture res ruins the areas and traveling them, and don't you dare say 'But ts a old game'  There was a point in my life I would never stop talking or thinking about this game, I called it the best rpg of all time and one of the best games of all time. I became a ignorant fanboy who couldnt think on his own(Happend to many). Proceeding to play other rpgs games and always quitting half way through I became super engrosed into the story of 7 to the point of depression. Latter in my life I realized that Final Fantasy 7 was the foundation of my depression and I was using it to hurt myself. As dramatic as this seems the game had a horrendous effect on me but I promise this did not effect my review.  To rap things up with everything I said I cant blame people for liking this game I'll respect you regardless because it could be worse, after FF8 and up the series gets worse and feature the worst told and written stories of all time.",

Then sadly disk 4 was scratched and completing the game became a distant memory. I then played all the other final fantasy series. Recently I decided to go back and play 7 again, on a steam sale. The music, the characters, the dialogue, the sound effects, the cheesy combat and menu screens. The world map, the bosses the towns......... it was all coming back to me, bringing me back to my 1st experience. This time I completed the game, was a touching moment. Young me appeared as a ghost cleaning the back of the cd in slow motion as the credits scrolled down the screen. I give this game a SOLID 100 out of 100 for changing my view on RPG's, and for allowing me to play other FF titles which had a profound impact on my gaming experience.

Just to stick to PS2 games alone, I had already played Final Fantasy 5/6, Legend Of Dragoon, Chrono Cross, Wild Arms 2, Parasite Eve 2, and a couple others I can't recall at the moment. When I finally got my own copy of the original computer version (circa 98-ish), I became involved in a whole new level of storytelling.  Like in the Princess Bride when the narrator says 'Since the invention of the kiss, there have been only five kisses that were rated as the most passionate, the most pure. This one left them all behind.' So it was with me, RPG's and Final Fantasy VII.  You can read other reviews for more reasons why it is worth your time. I became touched with the characters, personally involved with Cloud Strife, Sephiroth, Jenova and the planet itself.   Word from the wise though: Buy 99 Hyper when you can. They're 100 gil a pop and while you are in 'Fury' mode your limit gauge fills faster. You're welcome in advance.",

It caused cait sith's limit break to happen and everyone lost. The next was a materia with japanese characters in the name, but you could visibly see REVIVE (japanese character)P. It was a purple materia. The game freezes if you try to equip it. I don't know if the rumors about reviving aeris are true, but I do know I successfully hacked a reviveP materia. It was even the right color. This means the game was probably going to allow you to revive aeris, and they decided not to. No joke. I used so many gameshark codes though, that I am uncertain which is the right code. However, I did save the stream of codes so if I do find it again and update this review, I will post the gameshark codes and let people find the right code for themselves.   I am not sure I like the steam version of this game, their mouths are weird. Like lego shocked faces.  Give me about a month, possibly less, and check back at this review. I found my old gameshark pro and provided it didn't somehow delete itself in the past 15 years or so, I will post the stream of codes which spawn the revivep (it may also be the same string which has deathjoker command materia, so that'd be fun.) I just need to get an older playstation because the new playstation model does not have a slot for gameshark.",

The combat is pretty dull by modern day standards, but it has its charms.

Now for those that have not played the game at all before FF7 is regarded as one of the PS1's best games probably only being rivaled by MGS. If you're not a fan of JRPG's this one will probably not be for you. This one was a tough buy for me because I primarily play WRPG's however I enjoy certain JRPG's. I ended up really liking the game a lot. Its a long game so I suggest setting aside a lot of free time for this one. Now JRPG's are usually known for the angsty teenagers embarking on some quest to fight some androgynous super warrior to acomplish some goal, and for the most part FF7 is just that. However FF7 isnt as painful in that aspect like other JRPG's like FF8 for example and the game has a charming cheesiness to it. Combat is still the same like most JRPG's as in its turn based and youll find yourself fighting a wide array of different enemies. My biggest complaint for the game is the controls. Its doable but sometimes difficult trying to locate where the buttons have all been mapped. I suggest getting a dualshock 3 or controller of the likes to play but from what ive read some functions on the controllers arent supported (I think the d-pad wont work on DS3's for example) Overall this game Is a ton of fun and I definitely reccomend it if you like RPG's and even moreso if you like JRPG's.",

Fighting - Still learning how to make it better and it did well, summons, magic, swords, ninjas and fist, a mopey old guy named Vincent who still likes pretty kawaii for his age. Decent battle system and all, bigger weapons, bigger damage. &lt;3  Soundtrack - Aside from VIII and XIII saga, this is probably my favorite soundtrack out of the whole series (sans Gilgamesh's theme &lt;3 ) Although the soundtrack suffers from Final Fantasy syndrom at times where happy or sad music plays at incredibly unfitting times....  Story - Terrorist group finds that their actions uncover they actually were doing good in the wrong way and they go on a quest to stop an insane guy with an overly long hair that needs a haircut and attittude adjustment and stop a corrupt orginazation and Hojo at the same time. All the whole, discovering real memories, friendship, romance, Nanaki, food, villiages, weapons, really large weapons you have to fight, more villages, a crater, and a chick who dies too early.

Works fine with a keyboard once you get use to it, but it will also work with a controler Overall great version of a game that nevers gets old. check it out, especially if you only played the PS version.",

But beyond that this is still the same Final Fantasy 7 that most people know and love, the plot about coping and dealing with ones loss and identity still rings strong, with a great sound track and rather interesting cast of characters it is still fun to play, But there are just square trying to get some extra money. like exp boost, there is no need for that along with the extra DRM on top of steam is just plain baffling but you can turn off cloud saving to get past if you don't care about showing off your achievements on Square's homepage.  So do I recommend this game yes. do I recommend this version of it? well you should rather take the PSX if you can get your hands on it, if not, then this is a pretty good alternative to play one of gaming's most famous JRPGs. Just do yourself a favor and avoid the fandom of this game. it's full of silly people.",

It takes you al over the world and does not disapoint in its shock value dispite the dated graphics.  -Iconic music, this game is well known and well praised for its amazing batte music, victory music, and world music. fights can get annoying but for me its worth it to hear that intro and when you win its oh so worth it to hear that little jingle (that is now my ringtone).  -Graphics, so this is 2015 and everyone kinda is done with crappy PS2 graphics, BUT im telling you it's worth it to play through this gem of a videogame. Now it is however going to take some getting used to going back so many years in the past graphics wise, but trust me you will hardly care once you see some of the hard work and stunning art that went into this.  9.5/10",

If you like to get a lot of value for your money and like good story in an adventure/journey approach this give this game a go. They're not remaking another FF7 for no reason.  Pros: - Amazing music and sound. - Amazing atmosphere that goes very well with the sound and music. - The world is big and there's a lot to do and explore as well as side quests. - Story is complex and has a lot of dept/substance. You can't just sit and guess what is about to happen. - Characters are pretty interesting. - Graphics are amazing. - Gameplay has a lot of mini games and humor that makes it funny to play. - Battle system is well balanced.

However I am always on my PC and this thing is my life. I wanted to have Final Fantasy VII on my life. It looks great on Steam. Its the same great game we've always loved, they fixed the music issue, and the graphics are slightly better. Noticeably better I'd say. The characters even have mouths :).

These days I think people only really play it for nostalgia's sake.  ..and because of the announcement of the upcoming remake.    Though much of the game's mechanics are modernly outdated, like most of the mini-games and some of the UI that are a little odd &amp; time consuming to get around, it's got an extremely engaging story and non-linear exploration with satisfying rewards to back it up. As you progress your ways of exploration vastly improve and it's a rewarding experience when those points are reached.   During a battle the camera is set by default to cinematically move around. When you're choosing a target after selecting an attack, item, or whatever to use on and the camera's still moving it can be a little bit of a nuisance to try and set the cursor to your desired target. It can be a bit time consuming on making sure you've selected the right target in this case especially if the camera's still moving around because an attack is in progress. It doesn't help that the game functions on an active time battle mechanic so if you take too long deciding a target the enemy may make a move before you make a selection. The cinematic camera viewing can be toggled to sit still to look like previous Final Fantasy games.  Some of the maps can be a little confusing to get around where the blame is on the map design. You and other 3D NPCs are basically walking in front of either a still image or a looping video. When trying to go through doorways, roads that curve oddly, or whatever the like it can be extremely confusing to get around and find out where exactly you can set foot on the map.  The graphics are blatantly outdated, maybe even for 1997, but I think there's a real big charm to that.  The most in-depth part about this game regarding the actual main gameplay is the Materia system where each piece of Materia either casts a spell, summons, support other Materia, etc. which almost all will take the biggest roles in battles.  For better or worse the story, characters, music, and the world of FF7 is really what makes this entire game highly unique which got me hooked up until it's kind of lame ending.",

I tried to be unbiased because there are plenty of reviews that will tell you the game is the best ever, ermagerd! You gotta play it!!  Final Fantasy 7 is very story driven, but does not have any voice acting. You have to read to experience the story and skipping through dialog could mean that you miss out of important story details. Graphics are very outdated as this game is about 20 years old. Battle-System is turned based; turned based means you will need to wait for your action bar to fill before you can give your characters commands to attack or use magic. This might sound daunting for those who have never played a turn-based battle system, but it takes around 2 seconds for the bar to fill. Turn based is important for the game because you do have a lot of options for magic and attacks once you get deeper into the game. Character inventory is limited to a weapon slot, armor slot, and accessory slot, but this limitation works well for the game's design. Game starts out a bit slow, but then drastically picks up towards the middle through till the end and has many hours of side content. The game isn't very challenging as long as you put time into leveling your characters a bit before each boss fight. I recommend playing with a game guide so that you can get the full experience as there is a lot of side story and side content that could be easily missed.   This game remains in my top three all time favorites and will probably always be there as well. The story is incredible and could be a stand alone book by itself. Final Fantasy 7 is best played when you are looking to play something to immerse yourself in. The game is very rewarding and could very easily leave you wanting more. Luckily unlike other games, there are other media content available to further the story after you have beaten the game. I definitely recommend doing a play through even if just for the basic story if you are planning on playing the remake that has been announced. I have recommended that game many times to friends and even have bought steam copies for a few because I firmly believe in this game and its story.  10/10 would recommend",

The music is still amazing, the minigames are really fun, the chocobo breeding is really enjoyable, and rereading some of the dialogue between some of the more witty characters still makes me chuckle. FFVII is one of the very few games that I'm able to replay over, and over, and over, and over again. It's replayablity is something that I find myself being able to passionatly argue for.  As I said before, I don't think it's the best game ever made, but it sure as hell is a revolutionary game. Others might â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ about it being overrated, and that's understandable. Something can't get as popular as FFVII has, without getting some cynics.  Might be baised as all hell, but go out and pick it up. Stuff goes on sale ALL of the time on Steam.

If you have played the game before you will immediately notice the graphical difference. The textures have all been cleaned up and smoothed out. The first product of this is what I call 'Lego Face' where everyone has what looks like painted on faces and many of the characters are stuck with permanent 'O' mouths which are humorous. The second and larger problem is the screen backgrounds (Non-textured/interactive areas) have not been touched at all and have simply been stretched to fit the screen so they are horribly pixelated. Some screens are so bad it is hard to make out what the scenery is supposed to be and the characters look out of place. For this reason I have to fail the graphics even after giving a pass on the PSX-era graphics obviously.   As for the actual game it is of course a classic haralded for bringing this style of RPG back to the mainstream market. The music compositions as well as the character development and story progression have been raved about for decades. That being said, there is a nostalgia factor with most people that played the game during the PSX days and the game may not have aged well for new audiences. First the game is buggy...to the point there are several Save-File-Corrupting bugs that no rerelease version has bothered to fix. As far as the gameplay difficulty is set to 'Idiot Proof'. To illustrate this there is a point in the game where on the screen before a major boss battle you are, in plain sight, given a chest containing an item that renders you invinicible in that boss battle and this is no isolated incident. You will find guides for the game that severely limit what upgrades and items you can use in an attempt to create difficulty.   At the time of it's release I can tell you the amount of character development was great. We grow with some characters and we start to see others in a different light. Sure the story was so-so and played up many tropes and cliche situations but at the time everything out was so flat that it stood out. I have to say it does feel dated though. Taking off the nostalgia glasses I really see the characters different than I did as a pre-teen and all of the 'deep' commentary about brooding angst, capitalism, religion, and the environment is really just eye-roll worthy.   All of that being said, when it is on sale (I got for $3 at the time of my purchase) it is worth it to play either simply for the nostalgia or to see where games came from to see where they got today.",

They just didn't appeal to me anymore. It wasn't until the fall of 97, when I, a bright-eyed youngster just starting the 5th grade, played FFVII for the first time. I came in with no real expectations and thus, was not ready for the impact it'd have on my young, impressionable mind.  I fell in love, almost immediately. This was the game I had been waiting to play my entire life. To say I was obsessed was an understatement. All I wanted to talk about at school with my buddies was 'FFVII this and FFVII that!' I drew pictures of Cloud and Barrett all over my notebooks, I spent hours pouring over all the pictures in the strategy guide and I had the time of my life. This game made me laugh (Cloud in drag lol), it made me cry (Aerith.. RIP) and I knew from that moment, that I was a gamer for life.  It's since been 16 years and no other game has been quite as important to me. Final Fantasy Tactics is perhaps my favorite game in the series and Final Fantasy X had the best battle and leveling up system, but neither can touch what VII means to me. I've played other games over the years, games that I obsessed over as well.. from Super Mario World to the Last of Us, I've had a long time to play many games.. but no other game will ever touch Final Fantasy VII. To see it still be so popular makes me happy and I really hope that one day, we have a genuine remake so that a new generation of gamers can fall in love with these characters as I did.",

Basically you start off as a merc for a terrorist organisation, and your ojective is to blow up a reactor in a powerplant for a big city. The plot consitantly twists throughout the game staying interestng all the time. Use a little bit of imaginaton to overlook the game engine which is not better or worse than any other FF game engine, and youll see why everyone calls this the best FF.  In terms of RPG's in general its as indepth and consistant a storyline as any movie or game having multiple layers all well thought out.

I was really suprised to find that I not only still enjoyed this game, but absolutely loved it years later. What stands the test of time is the characters and world that the game so carefully builds as you play. You want the good guys to win and you want the bad guys to lose. Every character you gain feels like they have a good reason to be there. I often found I wanted to bring more characters along than my party would allow.   That materia system is great and ties into the world's background really well. Its very simple and versatile, and leaves you carefully considering what kind of equipment you would like to equip to plan for the proper amount of slots.  While I say that I enjoy the translation this game, it is not without its issues. There are a few times where plot points are not explained entirely well, and it can be hard to keep track of exactly 'who' is talking. This is perhaps why the game has a reputation for being 'deep' or 'artistic' in its writing, because it leaves much to the players interpretation.   In the end, I would reccomend this game to anyone who likes turn based RPGs or JRPGS. To anyone who once enjoyed this and thought it would not hold up, I would reccomend you give it another go, because I ended falling in love with it all over again.   Happy Gaming",

The best Final Fantasy, unless one of those hipster â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s who think the other ones are better because you didn't get enough attention as a child.  Anyways, there's not a terrible amount of incentive for you to pick up this when there are ROMs available. The added 'features' almost detract from the game more than add to it. Lame DRM, the most cookie-cutter achievements ever (there's only thirty six, many of which being completeing parts of the game, doing limit breaks, and getting final limit breaks), and what appears to be worse graphics in the pre-rendered backgrounds (they look much more pixely than I recall).  On the positive you can link the DRM to facebook (easy, but kind of weird), loading times have been virtually eliminated, and the models and text look a lot more crisp. The feature of Cloud saves (heh heh) are available too.  All in all, it's hard to rate ports without getting into the content of the original game, so let me just say this: If you haven't played it, and it's cheap, you should pick it up. Whether you like RPGs or not, you're sure to find the world of Midgar (and what follows... ) quite interesting. The game has an interesting though convoluted story, and is quite lengthy for your buck. The materia battle system isn't hokey like a lot of other FF battle system. You equip your guys some â¥â¥â¥â¥, it lets 'em do stuff, and it gets stronger as you level up. No probability, 'draws', skill trees or anything.

Ultimately it is a game which has definitely stood the test of time. This is a result of it's deep and compelling story and characters above all else, each with their own deeply rooted story in the game's world.  Final Fantasy VII's general fighting, inventory and world-traveling mechanics are generic for a Final Fantasy game nowadays, however in the original release on the PlayStation in 1997, it was a dramatic and comendable jump from the previous games on Nintendo's cartridge consoles by adding to each feature with new and improved quality and graphics.  A stunningly visual world, the steampunk-esq setting consists of a huge variety of locals in a huge, fully explorable world with a multitude of towns and villiages. The central city Midgar is the first thing you see in the game and it's clear that Square wanted to stun the player in the first few seconds by changing to a more modern world, and stepping away from the previous game's medieval fantasy settings.  For so many reasons, this game was and still is groundbreaking, one of the best RPGs of all time, and one of the biggest tear-jerkers.  Play it for yourself.",

The soundtrack, just like in every other FF game, wonderful and now actually fixed to sound like the PS1 version instead of the terrible PC MIDIs.  The graphics? Well, sadly, this isn't a remake and only a very small upgrade. The video quality is improved and the game is rendered in 1080p. However the models are still really low-polygonal and the pre-rendered 2D images that make most of the environments look quite pixelated a bigger screen. The framerate is locked at about 30-35 fps in the world and only 15 in the battles. If they're not making a true remake, they could at least adjust the old one a little more.  When it comes to gameplay, it is pretty good. The battle system and the materia features are quite enjoyable. The only minor issue I had with those is that some animations take way too long but at least they look cool. Controls in the world are quite outdated and a little crappy at times but it's nothing that makes the game a worse experience. The only bigger complaint I have about the game is the minigames. While a few work just right, some of them are annoying, especially since the buttons are named [OK], [CANCEL] etc. instead of their actual names and you might get lost.  Still, it's a really great game that everyone should play all the way through.

The main protagonist is a bit too 'edgy', however the other characters make up for the shortcomings of Cloud Strife. The game will last you about 40+ hours, depending on whether or not you choose to grind your levels, as well as collect the various ultimate weapons/master materia.

See my 10 hours of ganeplay? I have played longer but since this game is so awesome it lets you play without internet and optional cloudsaving with internet.  I've never played the original since I've never owned a PS but I had heard 'bout this game. I was doubting if I would buy it or not but then I decided that I couldn't really lose anything but money.  And let me tell you: I don't regret buying this game. It has everything. The music really touches your heart and is very varied. You will, and I mean WILL, remember the songs and you WILL enjoy having them stuck in your head.   Story: You're in a rocket headed to destroy a meteor, you fight a LARGE corporation with the odds against you (the game starts with you planting a friggin bomb!) and you meet many characters in your journey. You also get to fight a god and steal a giant airship. If this won't make you buy this game, I don't know what will.  Gameplay: Here is where many are wrong. As fast as you see gameplay you think: TURN-BASED, NOT AGAIN!!! That is wrong. This game lets you choose commands that the characters perform, yes. But you cann choose if you want it turn-based or not. The characters have a time bar. When full, you can choose a command.   Graphics: F*ck graphics, just play the game!  10/10 no doubt",

            "review_text": "I bought Final Fantasy VII more on a whim than anything. I'd heard it was a good game and had even heard that it was the best. I had the money, bought it, played an hour or 2 and then stopped for a long time. I started it back up again a little while back and I am glad I did.  Gameplay: 8/10 If you don't know how Final Fantasy works then you need a heavy dose of internet. This game holds the standard turn-based combat, however there is one difference I've noticed. This game can be switched into a real-time non-stop combat sort of deal. I don't mean being able to do whatever but rather the game doesn't stop for you. It may seem small but I am very glad this was a feature. In this game, the combat doesn't stop to let you think. If the enemy is faster than you, they'll attack more and if you take too long to think, they'll keep wailing on you. There are several times when I would be defeated because my character was killed before they could attack and I was never too angry. It was annoying on occasion, especially when an enemy turned me to stone or used that stupid FROG SONG but for the most part I could live with it. You level up by winning battles and so on. You also have Materia in this game which is basically something you can equip into your weapons and armor to give skills and boosts. A Cure Materia lets that character use Cure and if you link that with an All Materia then they can cast Cure on the entire party! The Materia allows for a lot of customizability in this game. You don't have to force Aeris into being a cleric (although character stats may influence things). I equipped Cure on all of my main party (Cloud, Tifa, Barret) and it worked out splendidly. The game makes a point that when certain Materia is equipped, certain stats are raised and lowered, however I never actually found this to affect anything. This game may also occasionally throw a special minigame sort of thing at you like the Chocobo Races later on and they're cool and all but the game has a habit of saying things like 'Use [Switch] to do this' or something like that and it refers to whatever key that command is bound to and it gets annoying because some are rarely used. Combat has Ultimate attacks as well which are very powerful attacks that vary depending on which one you've earned, although they tend to be a nuisance a lot of the time. A bar fills when you get hit and when it peaks you can use any Ultimate of the level you have equipped, but you can't do a regular attack until you use it. This caused me a lot of frustration when I'm saving my Ultimate for a boss but don't have the MP to keep using spells.  Story: 9/10 Story is a tad cliche with the 'save the world' sort of thing, but it does so very well. Your character (I will call him Cloud) is an ex-SOLDIER who is helping AVALANCHE take down the Shinra corporation because they're killing the planet. He helps destroy a factory and leaves saying he doesn't care about the world. After some convincing he tries to be cool guy and helps save the world. The game starts off with you in Midgard, then after events you start exploring to save the world. You meet some interesting characters with some pretty good backstories. Cloud wants revenge on Sephiroth, Tifa is helping Cloud, Barrett wants to protect his little girl and many more. They're told much better in game, trust me. You travel around and fight monsters and travel some more. The traveling is where I feel the game lacks. A bit later in the game I found myself lost. I couldn't figure out where to go and I'm not sure if I missed key dialogue or what but there were times I found the way forward on accident. SPOILER ALERT! Later in the game you go to find Sephiroth. Where is he? Well I traveled all the way north to a fossil village and somebody there answered my question. He went through there to find the Temple of the Ancients which is on the exact opposite side of the world. Wait what?  Graphics: 7/10 I shouldn't bag on it too much because it was originally PS1 but I don't think they're the best and some CGI cutscenes weren't very well done in my opinion.  Sense of Progression: 7/10 This may be a bit of my personal getting lost, but any progress seemed lackluster as sometimes bosses would appear out of nowhere. I'm leaving a place, use a door and then BOOM! Wall demon? I'm not sure if I missed some context but... I never truly felt like I progressed at most times as I fought so much trying to find the objective I didn't know the location of that I would one-shot most normal enemies and bosses stopped being difficult.  Enemies: 8/10 Varied and special. Some had resistances, some used spells. Then there's the frogs... I don't like the frogs.  Length: 10/10 36 hours and only completed the first disc. I'm in for a long ride.  Overall: 8/10 I had to speed this up due to Steam review character limits but I do say this game is good. I can see why a lot of people praise it so and I would recommend it to anyone with the money if it's $20 or less.",

            "review_text": "This was my very first RPG back in 1997 on the PS1. I fell in Love with RPGs after this game and, well, have played and beaten every possible version/port/sequel/prequel (Excluding the cell phone game that never made it to the US) associated with FF7. When I found out there was a PC version back in 2003 I jumped on it immediately. Despite the Chocobo racing bug, despite the horrible midi music, and despite everyone aside from the main playable characters unable to close their mouths I still loved the PC version. Then the Graphic mods came out. Needless to say I was playing this game non-stop again. I was a bit confused when Steam said they had a version with extra features cause I thought it was just the PC port with maybe the bugs fixed. I was glad to see achievements added and better then the one that came directly from SE's re-release.  FF7 redefined RPGs and did a fantastic job at setting the bar. The story is very in depth and the twists you encounter are fantastic. SE (then Squaresoft) made very risky and Bold decisions while making this game. The story aside the gameplay is amazing. The Materia system makes for easy customization of characters and skills while still limiting the amount of skills you can use, but completely interchangeable. FF7 was probably the first FInal Fantasy game that really required inventory management and strategy on how you customized your characters. Do you go with the super powerful weapon with 2 non-linked materia slots or do you go with the okay weapon with 8 linked materia slots? Do you equip the added effect materia with bio on your weapon to add poison to your attack or your armor to protect you from poison? DO you use the ALL materia with your Cure or your Fire? DO I use this weapon that give me more slots but no materia exp or not? Choices that really effect HOW you play.  The mini games are fun as well and not just 1 time events. The Gold Saucer lets you go back and replay any mini game you have already done at least once in the main story. Take Road Rash, Cool Boarders, underwater submarine battles, and 'Horseback Racing' (Done on Chocobos) and put them into FF7 and you can spend countless hours just messing around.  FF7 is challenging and very rewarding with tons of side-quests that give you a good payoff but also enrich the story and characters. Not to mention multiple optional bosses, secret gear, hidden/optional characters. There is so much to be done in FF7 you wont be disappointed.  Thankfully the things I don't like about this port you don't have to do or use.  The Character booster is a bit of a let down. Instead of just maxing out your level it only increases your HP, MP and Gil to the 'max' and dummies down the enemy's stats. I would have rather just seen it increase my character's level to 99. Using it early on in the game makes limit breaks impossible to ever obtain and just eliminates the 'getting to know how to play' stage where you developed strategy. Plus once you use it there is NO going back. So if you are stuck on a boss and just wanna get a quick boost to beat it then go back to playing normally you can't you are stuck with the weaker enemies and constant leveling that just becomes un-important. I would have rather seen a character editor then a booster. But luckily you don't have to use it, so it's a moot point.  The only other thing I would haveliked to see would be a New Game+ option.  In all FF7 is still a FANTASTIC rpg and although the graphics are.... well... blocky... the game has aged very very well.  20/10  Plus play this before the Remake comes out so you can fully enjoy the Remake!",

Leveling in this game was also perfect. There was never a point in the game where I felt I needed to grind in order to finish off a boss. You can get through the game with random encounters alone. Along with the main story, there was a vast world to explore, with many cities featuring their own characters and scenery, as well as quests and other things to do. Lore and storytelling were on point. Cloud is actually a very likeable character with an interesting past, and his party members all have their own backstory and reasons for helping Cloud. For me, however, the music was the best part of the game. All of the tracks fit perfectly with the game and stuck with me even after playing, especially tracks like 'One-winged Angel' and 'Fight On'.  9/10",

This game came WAY before its time. til this day, its one of my most memorable playthroughs of any game I've played (And I've played A LOT).   If you are trying to play FFVII for the first time in this day and age, I recommend downloading some of the mods available for it. The old school, early PS1 graphics might just scare you away lol.

Add a 'new game plus' with multiple endings, perhaps scoring the Holy materia while winning a particularly difficult optional battle with Aeris in your party, and maybe even save Aeris?

The combat system makes you feel tense eventhough its turn based. You can't just press attack over and over again and excpect to win. The system is relatively simple in concept, but in action, it runs in a way where if you make a mistake, instead of something like pokemon if you accidently press leer instead of leef whip, you just make leaf whip more powerful and it ends up not harming you to much in the end. However, in this game, and a few other Final Fantasy games, if you make accidently use cure on someone who died, and than heal Cloud who is already at full health, you can, and are far more likely to lose the fight. The time constraint also makes some be able to attack more than once in between your wait time, also making it super annoying, in the best of ways, to fight some of the faster enimies. Also a huge plus in my opinoin, THERE IS ABSOLUTLEY NO GRINDING, IT IS 40 HOURS OF NO GRINDING! this is up there in my top ten rpgs of all time. I would personnaly recomend Chrono Triger above this, but still this is amazing.",

Nearly 20 years after it originally released, it's still an incredible game to play.   The story is fantastic. The battle system is simple and smooth. The materia system allows you to play the character you want, how you want. The music? It's outstanding. Seriously, amazing. Did I mention how great the story is? Well, I'm saying it again. Just the right mix of fantasy, reality, and sci-fi. It's also home to one of the best video game villains of all time; Sephiroth.  All of that aside, there are also plenty of minigames and side quests you can do. Some are largely pointless, others help you access unique items or high-end magic. The minigames unfortunately are a little clunky, and the menus can be a bit awkward at times, but that's about it. There's nothing else you can hold against this game.  If you want a good RPG, or something with a great story... What are you waiting for? Buy it, you won't regret it.  Edit: It requires you to make an account with Square Enix in order to play, which can be a royal pain since their server simply doesn't send emails sometimes. Try a different email address if need be, and just be a little patient if it doesn't work right away. It'll work eventually, and it's totally worth it.",

            "review_text": "In 1997, a JRPG like no other took the world by storm and introduced the West to a whole new type of video game. It was upbeat, clever, and full of grand adventure. It was dark, heartbreaking, and full of moments of despair as well as triumph. It was massive, containing a world that took at least seventy hours, if not even more, to fully explore. It was also concise, gathering nine unique, broken but hopeful heroes in a quest to defeat a near unstoppable madman, all ten of whom have since become icons in gaming worldwide. And through it all, a soaring musical score gave them all identity, personality, and relatability in a game with no spoken words.  This game...was Final Fantasy VII.  Like the first six Final Fantasies before it, FFVII is a standalone title with its own story, characters, and universe. As such, you can jump right in without missing anything. In this installment, you take up the massive sword of Cloud Strife, a sullen yet determined young man with more to his initial demeanor than meets the eye. In your very first mission, you join a gang of eco terrorists named AVALANCHE and blow up a city power plant, defying the corrupt energy company that controls most of the planet, but costing untold innocent lives in the process. But soon events spiral beyond your control, and it's up to you to save the planet alongside the brittle AVALANCHE leader Barret, a beautiful flower girl named Aerith, and Tifa, the only friend you have left from your old life...  FFVII plays like most old school JRPGs, with your party wandering a massive world map and encountering monsters and enemies as you go. The combat is turn based, wherein you and your opponents attack in turns with different moves, ranging from attacks with your weapons to magical spells to summoning all manner of creatures and warriors to inflict massive amounts of damage. Each ability you can use is equipped with a gemstone called a Materia, which you can level up for more powerful results by continuously fighting with it equipped. Practicing Materia combinations can result in some incredible strategies, so experiment until you find the combos that work best for you.  Newcomers not used to JRPGs or retro gaming may not immediately click with a game that came out back in 1997. Their initial response is understandable, given that video games and the technology used to make them were very different back then. Personal feelings and the fanbase's nostalgia aside, the character models for the world map and non combat events are very simple and low detail, with their quality improving during battles and cinematic cutscenes. This is also a localized game originally from Japan, and some things tend to get lost in translation. The Steam version is apparently much better than the original Playstation release, but there are occasional odd moments in dialogue. As stated above, none of this dialogue is spoken, which means you're reading everything the characters say via word bubbles.   The plot can be a little hard to follow if not paid complete attention to, and the lore is pretty expansive. Certain moments feel a little jumbled (and one section slightly distasteful), and not everything is always made entirely clear. It can be a real grind to, well, grind up experience for the Materia you need to kill the more powerful bosses, especially towards the end of the game.  But the biggest potential issue that even diehard fans will admit to?  Minigames.  Minigames EVERYWHERE.  However, these gameplay mechanics and designs, these flaws, should not be used as an excuse to not give this game a good ten to twenty hours before quitting. There is a reason so many Final Fantasy fans will declare this game the best of the series and/or their personal favorite, and why Square Enix has finally caved to the years of demands for a full remake on newer consoles. The story here is one of the most powerful you will ever experience, and the extra lengths you go to become stronger make the end battles you fight all the more sweeter to win. Your party almost becomes a little family to you, friends you never thought you'd make. You'll laugh. You'll cry. You'll clench your fist in rage and pump it in the air in triumph.  Because I guarantee that once you've begun Final Fantasy VII, 'there ain't no gettin' off this train!'  9/10",

I really love most of Uematsu's work anyway, but this soundtrack is definitely in my top two!  Story: The main storyline is great. Even though it does not always provide the best character development, the game provides some interesting side quests to fill in the blanks. There are a lot of great moments where the characters really come to life despite their polygonal forms.  Battle: The PC version maintained all of the same mechanics as the PS1 version. The turn-based fighting can be tedious, especially in the beginning when you have no helpful materia. It is really great that you can be powerful without hours and hours of grinding up to level 100. I think I beat the game at level 38 at my lowest.  Mini-games: Sometimes I get so consumed by the mini-games, I spend hours playing and run out of money. I also love how Squaresoft smoothly incorporated some of the mini-games into the main storyline.  Overall: 9.75/10 - I can't wait to see how the HD remake enhances this already fantastic game!",

However, unlike most, I do not include FF7 in my top 10 rpg's or even in my top 5 FInal Fantasy titles. I fel it is far too overrated and the hype around Cloud is outlandish at best.   In short, FInal Fantasy 7 is worth your time. It is s solid RPG with several memorable moments.",
