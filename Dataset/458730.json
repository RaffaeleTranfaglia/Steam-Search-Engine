            "review_text": "Perfectly ported, excellent optimization. Runs rock solid 60fps, 1080p on mid range hardware. Stand alone 'Rest option' is a fantastic addition to save time while doing events and having all DLC from the get go is an awesome treat too!  Here's a FAQ, for those on the fence:  Differences between this and the vita version? Higher resolution, all DLC for free, Japanese audio is included (AND THANK GOD FOR THAT.)  Is this port censored? Nothing is censored at all. Expect to wade through: not so innocent innuendo, boob mechanics, skimpy outfits, panty fighting and panty-shots. Enjoy. ;)  Is this a serious game to get into? Nope. And that's not a bad thing. Approach this game with an open mind and enjoy it for what it is. It's pretty heavy on dating sim elements and has simple combat mechanics, but it's still plenty fun and the girls are cute too. Production values are very high, art is very polished and music is also very good. So all in all you'll enjoy it. Just don't expect a 'Persona substitute' because it's not.  Do I recommend it? Hell yes. Go for it. It's very much worth the price and more!",

Just cause it's new to Steam does not mean you get to charge the price it is when it came out on the the console.  As far as the games goes it's pretty good. Box standard Persona esque dungeon crawer. The storys meh but the interactions with the charas make it pretty good. To the point that I find myself kinda dreading the actual game play dungeon crawing part because I want to have more interactions with the charas. If you're looking for something to hold you over till Persona 5 comes out then this probaly will do the trick.",

The nudity... from what i have scene up to chapter two, is what you see in Sailor Moon. Outlined bodies with prism colors.  The gameplay reminds me alot of Mega Man: Mission Command. With the turn base battles with crisp, clean, and smooth battles.   This game IS WORTH the 20 bucks",

            "review_text": "The initial parts of the game are okay, despite the cringy mechanics (read: classmating) and the weird story that it has. However, the game gets boring over time since this is a grindy game and, obviously, you will need to grind. A LOT. The labyrinths are unforgiving, too, with tons of unnecessary twists and turns. Overall, it should be an okay game, but it just gets boring. If you're a masochist who likes to make him/herherself suffer from monotonous dungeons and grinding, then suit yourself, please do buy this game if you would like to. However, if you're a person who gets bored fast, this game isn't suited for you. In the end, this game would be one of those games that I'll play when I run out of games to play.",

Neutral:Story is so so , battles are ok( i like the way you can change the position of your characters , changing the evolution of the battle entirely)  Bad:Dungeons are ridiculous,repetitive , boring , a complete disaster.Prepare for Hours and hours of grind as most of the equipment is useless.Seriously , the dungeons killed the game.

The main character is literally 'God's Gift' just how much more power fantasy do you need.   I really wish i had the ability to do 2 different reviews because on the negative side, all that ♥♥♥♥ i just said.

Between dungeons you interact with the girls in VN style and based on your answers you increase your relationship with them and in turn make stronger star children.  The game is an aquired taste, however if you like the Ar-Tonelico style of dating sim dungeon crawler you will feel right at home.",
