            "review_text": "Well people say alot of bad stuff about the game but i got into it, im an RPG fan and my first PC game was Dungeon Siege 1. I like games that offer gameplay and variety over graphics and storylines tho i do enjoj good story lines. Overall this game is not that bad if u want an RPG with semi good graphics. The game is not turn based its more like neverwinter nights style of gameplay, it takes time to hit, move or cast a spell once ur in combat but outside it you move normaly. Each unit has its own spells, weapons and skills. The camera is a ♥♥♥♥♥, its glytchi sometimes get stuck and wont move, controls are a pain because sometimes the selection cyrcle gets stuck, sometimes u wana select 1 unit but it wont it just keeps selecting the same one over and over, sometimes you group your units into group 1 but when u press number 1 1-2/5 times it wont work, sometimes characters run to pull a lever for around 20 secs eaven if they stand right infront of it... Overall if u can look pass these few errors the game is not that bad and its enjojable. Combat is hard, u need good tactics and planing ahead is the onli thing keeping u alive most of the time, your units are not much stronger than enemies so the combat is pretty balanced, when u go 4v4 u can lose very easy or win just by an inch from losing. If the game is in a bundle or on sale and ur bored pick it up and try it, just give it time, pass 1-2 chapters before u give up.",

The units at times don't respond very well (even when the game is paused, they don't carry out the order) and the game feels outdated even though it was made in 2012 (...?!). I didn't enjoy playing the game. I didn't feel the immersion behind it like other games of its genre and it was rather bland.  I'd stay away from this game - don't believe me?
