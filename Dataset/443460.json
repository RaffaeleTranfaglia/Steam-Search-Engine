Its concept of the player choosing their own path is wonderful and its story is so vague you can interpret it many different ways or at least that's what I got out of it. During my playthrough, I checked more than once whether it was windy or pouring rain outside my window because the ingame sounds are so well done I couldn't tell the difference. Overall, I had a blast playing Star Sky 2 and highly recommend this to anyone who wants a short relaxing experience. Seriously, it's really relaxing. It only has 3 controls; Up, Right, and Left on the arrow keys so you can lean back in your chair or lie down in bed with a laptop.",
