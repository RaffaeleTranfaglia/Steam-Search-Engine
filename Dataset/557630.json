            "review_text": "IN SHORT : Do episode 1. If you liked the universe, you need the second episode ; wich is even better but a little bit confusing because of the multiples yet contradictory endings  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Oh dear...  Of course I liked it.  At the beginning of episode 1, Hello Charlotte sounded like a bad joke. Instant deaths for touching a cube, silly monsters, riddles that only rely on luck...   Hello Charlotte did look like one of the numerous surrealistic RPGM horror games. By exagerating all of their defaults, it became clear that it was actually more of a parody of these.  But there was something more. The 4th wall breaking was somehow well done (can't we ignore Undertale was out at the same time?) and created consistency behind the parody. The characters, the universe were solid and very charming, not only built for parody.   So what would the creator of such a game do in a second episode?  Developp this universe of course! And I'd say that was what I liked the most in this episode 2. The secondary characters got a past, the world looked well constructed.  Episode 2 is more like a Visual Novel parody, and, well, this was even more enjoyable than the first episode.  The art is impressive, the music is awesome, the ambience is perfect.  The world of Hello Charlotte is hopeless and scary. There is an order, a routine, but it will break apart as soon as you approach the end.  That's maybe why this game is not a 10/10 to me : the endings are satisfying when taken on their own, but in the end a little bit confusing, as they contredict each others in terms of universe's consistency. That wouldn't be a problem if the game was really belonging to the surrealistic RPGM gendra, but the end of ep 1 and most of ep 2 progressivly gave more and more consistency to this awfull yet fascinating universe of eyeballs and false gods.  Or are they true? Eh, I don't even know now... This has been a long emotional journey (yet 10 hours for the 2 episodes), I need some rest...  ...but pls episode 3 !",
