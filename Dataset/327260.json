            "review_text": "This game claims to be about following a single character through a number of console systems. You would think that emulating the game and art styles would be important then. While superficially and at a single glance the art styles change they do not actually conform to limitations present by each system. Instead every console plays exactly the same other than a new coat of paint. If you are attracted to the idea of playing games through the ages this is not for you. If you want a bog standard platformer that doesn't seem to actually understand the appeal of its own themes then go nuts.",

            "review_text": "Though it would seem self-evident from its nostalgia based advertisement, proclamations of historical knowledge, and general retro theming, I remain unclear as to what Life of Pixel actually wanted to be.  As a minimalistic platformer aiming to present itself through the lens of 13 dated gaming platforms, the immediate answer would seem that Life of Pixel is trying to encapsulate the evolution of gaming from its inception up through the 16-bit era. Except that here that evolution is personified as solely the product of graphical improvement without any of the underlying design principles of a particular era. Life of Pixel would propose to say that gaming’s heritage is rooted solely in the capabilities of a given platforms hardware, spouting off wiki-like tech sheets as if the only significant element of any given period of gaming is how many pixels a machine can push.  This seems an especially shallow understanding gaming’s history, because it neglects the ways in which those recognizable graphical aesthetics were so entirely linked to and created out of the ways developers were forced to compromise in all areas of design based on the limitations of the machine they were working with. One can’t begin to accurately recreate the technological development of videogames without first understanding how, in the presence of such limited resources, developers had to devise intricate and convoluted workarounds in order to have their games actually run on such low-powered hardware.  At no point does Life of Pixel manage to shake its artificial nature. It attempts to step back in time but one foot is always stuck firmly in the presence, creating a bizarre dissonance between the era Life of Pixel is attempting to replicate and the one it actually exists in. But let’s suppose Life of Pixel only ever aspired to chronicle the visual progression of games, entirely removed from any other variable but the most iconic graphical style of a platform’s lifespan. In this Life of Pixel fares much better, often coming close to approximating a memorable historical look even as everything underneath it feels wholly out-of-place.  But if Life of Pixel is solely a visual showcase then it is again betrayed by its adherence to modernity. Though it may appear to align with the graphical identity of whichever platform it is attempting to recreate itself upon, it doesn’t go far enough to actually represent that platform authentically. The resolution is too high, the frame rate and animations too smooth, and the amount of information on-screen too extensive to feel believable. It is unlikely many would like to play a modern game running at the same resolution as the Apple II or C-64, but with the graphics of those systems being so defined by the same capabilities that Life of Pixel ignores it is hard to accept it as a legitimate visual chronology of gaming history, rather than merely another game attempting to ape the appearance of games long past in order to sell itself on the basis of nostalgia.  But let’s again qualify Life of Pixel’s attempts at historical recreation by considering it as its own game that simply wishes to borrow the aesthetics of gaming heritage in such a way as to be recognizable, rather than genuine. Once removed from its attempts at creating a technological timeline, it seems crucial to consider whether Life of Pixel’s various aesthetics can really be considered retro anymore. Within the context of the game they are of course attempting to align with a particular era of gaming, but once we move beyond that (for reasons already discussed), what separates Life of Pixel aesthetic from any number of modern 8 and 16-bit games? With how extensively modern games (especially within the indie spectrum) have revisited and repurposed graphical styles originally synonymous with 80’s and 90’s game systems, it feels as if we have long since moved beyond the point where every gaming using pixel-art should be categorized as retro. I feel the distinction is necessary because while we continue to view pixel-art as inherently dated its usage will always seem driven by nostalgia, rather than being an intentional aesthetic decision chosen for reasons beyond its historical context.  So returning to Life of Pixel with this in mind, setting aside its middling attempts at historical authenticity, we are left with an entirely inoffensive but unremarkable platformer. Its visuals might be varied, but the art direction is routinely mundane, seemingly driven through a desire to exist within a given style of pixel-art but not do anything interesting with it. There is a solidity to Life of Pixel’s mechanics, but also a pervasive tepidity brought about by its simplicity and tedium. Early levels are dull for their basic, tutorial-like nature, where later levels are tiresome in their difficulty, becoming larger and more prone to cheap deaths while retaining the same meandering level designs of the more manageable early game.  From all fronts it would appear Life of Pixel fails to find its footing. Its historical pursuits lack nuance, its visual replication proves inauthentic, and beneath all its appeals to nostalgia there is little to find but an overwhelmingly ordinary platformer, becoming then indistinguishable from so many other pixel platformers. And I don’t think that’s necessarily fair to Life of Pixel because it is at least trying for something more substantial in trying to pay tribute to gaming’s heritage, but its attempts are so sterile and superficial that they provide little to distract from an otherwise decidedly plain experience.

            "review_text": "Not for the faint of heart, for those who expect a checkpoint, or those who can't beat an emulator without the constant use of save states. Life of Pixel is remniscent of the days when console games didn't have battery backup for saved game profiles, it uses the elements of game design to teach the player how to play the game, and even mirrors some of the graphical glitches present in old consoles. For someone like myself who started with an Intellivision, and played various Apple ][, DOS, NES, SNES, Atari, Colecovision, etc., I felt right at home with this game right out of the box. Literally everything about this game was well engineered to mimic the feel of retro gaming, and for that it serves it's purpose extremely well, better than most games that attempt to be 'retro'. I highly recommend this game for anyone who has played lots of old platformers, but I do not recommend it for those who have only played modern games and expect a pat on the back.",

            "review_text": "Well, this is an interesting little thing, I'll give it that much. What we've got here is a simple retro-themed jumpy game with the gimmick of going through different 'eras' of video game consoles and home computers. Credit has to be given to the selection here; rather than just a simple Nintendo-centric view of old video games like a lot of this genre boils down to, they have a wide variety of consoles on display here, each with their own quirks. Consoles like Atari 2600 and Sega Master System are here, as well as 80's computers like the Commodore 64 or ZX Spectrum. The aesthetic for each platform is represented well enough, and there's plenty of variety; although there's only one track for each console's set of 8 levels. You'll be hearing that one track a lot.  This game's tough, and not an entirely fair tough. It's a masocore-esque jump game with lots of instant death hazards, and surprise spikes are in abundance here. If that kind of thing puts you off, this isn't for you. Hell, I like my games hard and it still soured me because there are also no checkpoints. Fine and dandy when you have single screen affairs, but the issues compound when the consoles get more advanced. By the time you hit the NES and SNES eras, the levels have become two to three-minute long sprawling stages where one missed jump or failure to know a trap was ahead in advance leaves you to redo the whole thing over. Some might call that being faithful to old video games and their high difficulty level, but I disagree; even the hardest NES games had  checkpoints , for goodness's sakes. The shorter levels end up being tolerable, but those longer ones really drove me up the wall with this.   Though the graphics and sound evolve over time as you advance console generations, the gameplay almost never changes. What few new wrinkles they add in are either minor gimmicks or rarely used. There are some powerups, but they're so few and far between and minor that they only alter things for a handful of stages. The majority of the game is just you and a double jump against enemies that walk back and forth, flying enemies guarding jumps that annoy more than challenge, and a bunch of instant death. If nothing else, the control is almost without fault; the only issue being the awkward momentum when jumping from moving platforms.  All in all, it's mediocre. I paid 2 bucks for it and got 5 hours out of it. It's worth that, I guess, and I'm giving it a 'recommended' since I don't outright despise it. It's not terribly offensive or anything. It's just kind of there. An admirable attempt at emulating a variety of old console aesthetics, but the actual game part isn't really all that hot, I'm afraid. If you see it on sale and you like old video games and don't mind the 'new' retro style of instant kill spikes everywhere, you'll probably dig it. Otherwise, it might not be your thing.",

            "review_text": "A really good platformer with good artsyles.  The game tells the history of old school systems and plays through levels that looks like whatever machine the game talks about. Every level is very well designed and have plenty of hidden collectibles. This is one of those games that honestly is tailor made for 100% completionist. But even with that the game is a great platformer with good controls that I highly recommend you check out. You will even learn some good history about how gaming was back then on the first computers and video game consoles that actually played games!  Rating: 10/10",

            "review_text": "I love this game, there's just something about going through all the retro machines and experiencing all the different styles. Collectibles are very well done and so are achievements. Although for the purists it may seem like 'Oh no it's not actually emulating the capability of those systems' the game never claims to do that and I'm perfectly fine with giving a modern edge on these older generation machines, that's what makes this game so enjoyable.   The levels in each machine are just long enough to get you to feel accomplished once you've finished them but also make you look forward to the next set of levels.  The actual platforming aspect of the game also works very well, the only reasons I would miss a block, fall off and die is because of my older controller. But otherwise it is a very fair game with bits that are just a little bit evil. Mostly in the beginning stages where the levels dont scroll with the player but screen after screen, those can be tricky. One more thing to mention about gameplay is the secrets, there are some and they are quite easy to find. Actually I believe I haven't missed any in my playthrough so far, but I wouldn't know if I did anyway. I could only tell by not getting the final achievemnt for collected fruit.   If there was one thing I fault this game for, it is that the gameplay doesn't change throughout the levels only their design does. Although wether this bothers me that much I don't know.  Is it worth £5?   Well if you saw this game and got a warm feeling inside imagining the gameplay through the levels then yes, yes it is worth your money. Get it right now on 50% off for a great deal on a great platformer.",

You literally get to read about old-school tech (which I really appreciated the historical perspective), and then play through levels that simulate what that tech could do.   Does  Life of Pixel  bring anything new to the table, or to platforming in general?  Absolutely not.   Would it keep a platforming enthusiast busy for a weekend with its online leaderboards?  Probably.    Watch some LetsPlays, and/or get it on sale. Do not expect this to be moving the genre forward with some wild innovation (I'm thinking of titles like  Super Meat Boy , or  Braid  for inspirational examples here). Just know that this is fairly simple platforming with a historical twist. ",

For example, in the first 8 levels, if your character ever touches a tiny bit of water, you're dead, even though your character is still on the ground next to the water. Oh and let's not forget the huge difficulty spike once you finish the 8bit story and try the next levels.  That being said, the game has decent music and visuals. It's also quite fun to learn about all these old consoles. More consoles would've been great, but from what has been said on the forums, the devs lost a lot of money making this game, so it's easy to understand why there are only 13 consoles.",
