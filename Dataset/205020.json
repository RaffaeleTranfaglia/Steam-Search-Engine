            "review_text": "This game is very atmospheric and charming. The art style is amazing and the audio/music is too. The puzzles are (sometimes convoluted but mostly) decent and have a very tactile feeling to them.  However it is frustrating to have to fight to get the game to do what I wanted it to. Expect input lag. Expect to misclick and have to wait upwards of 15 seconds to be able to do anything. Expect glichy areas where it takes upwards of 40 clicks just to get her to open the damned drawer. It took me forever to figure out why sometimes I couldn't open up my inventory. It's always hard to tell where exactly to click to get something done, making navigation difficult. At one point during the victory animation of a puzzle I clicked the back button to go progress in the game, but I apparently backed out too quickly and had to DO THE PUZZLE OVER. A brilliant game but you really have to fight with it.  Other complaints include the fact that all of their generated graphics (characters, speech bubbles(?)) are noticibly uglier than the rest of the game. There are also a few graphical errors (teleporting birds, boats rocking on a loop that isn't quite complete and then jerking back to the start of the animation loop). Another thing is that they say it should take about 10 hours to complete, but I'd say this number should be closer to 5. It took me just over 5 hours and that included the time it took for me to search around online to try to find a way to progress (it turned out that I just had to keep clicking the same spot over and over until the game finally decided that I had clicked the hitbox I needed to click).   Other than the frustration that comes with every minute of playing this game, it is a nice game and it does have interesting puzzle mechanics and a nice atmosphere. Wouldn't really recommend for the price.",

It was a lot more linear than I expected - none of the classic back and forth of classic point-and-clicks - but it was charming, gorgeous (it's all handmade, mostly from paper) and surprisingly challenging at times. Was also surprised by the darkness and depth of the story.  Took about five hours all up so $20 is a bit steep, although it's currently 25% off in the Steam sale. Even if you hold off buying, definitely add it to your Wishlist.",

            "review_text": "I love this game so much that I find it an insult it's only rated 93%.  What can I say? It's one of those games that you can just sit back, relax and get lost in.  Gameplay: You're basically on a linear path to find your grandpa and there are tons of puzzles along that you need to solve to move forward. The puzzles have been implemented seamlessly into the story which gives you a very satisfying feeling when you complete a section. That said, some of the puzzles can be a little cryptic or just damn make no sense, luckily you have a handy little book that helps you along the way if you get stuck.  Music: Music is a huge part of this game. I'm not one of those people who pays too much attention to game music but when it's there I really appreciate it. Lumino City has some of the best music I've ever come across from any game. Not only is it pleasing to the ear, it matches the mood of whatever is going on in the game - sometimes even syncing to the games sound effects. Make sure to play this on a device that is capable of delivering good quality bass.  Art: The artwork looks like it's all been done by hand and painstakingly animated into the game. A lot of love and attention has clearly gone into creating the visuals and I have to say they've come out perfect. All in all It looks unlike any game I've seen before, a true work of art.  Conclusion; I recommend this game to anyone who likes a bit of puzzle solving. Five minutes in and you'll be hooked.  Something that I haven't seen mentioned a lot is the game's ability to recover from a crash. I'm not saying the game crashes a lot, because it doesn't (at least for me), but when it does crash, it brings you back to exactly where you were before. It basically constantly autosaves so you will never end up doing the same thing twice.  There is one thing that does bug me about the game though, I wish it gave you the option to choose the speed in which you read the dialogue. Although it gives you more than enough time to read before moving on, you end up missing some stuff because you may have been distracted for a second.  Please note that I've played this game for a lot more hours than it says up there. I played it before at a friend's house and nearly finished it so I decided to get it myself.",

It's a beautifully crafted world with some very challenging and abstract puzzles. The visuals really pull you into the game as does the music. Although it may seem cute for kids, it really is an older kid to adult game. The story is great, so far, and really keeps you wanting to move forward. Everything feels alive. I'm still playing.  There are some bugs when clicking on certain things. For instance, I had a baker get stuck in his window with no interactions available with him to continue the story. I had to just exit the scene and re-enter it. Fixed the problem. Continued as normal.  My only other gripe would be that it sometimes takes a bit of time running back and forth between puzzles and doing things. This would be because of the way the game is. You click and need to wait for the character to complete the action completely before being able to continue and click again. If you purchase this and get to the waterwheel, you'll see what I mean. It's a minor thing, but just a little annoying at times.  There is a great deal of satisfaction upon completing the puzzles and seeing/hearing the visuals come to life. The characters throughout the game are charming and memorable. It was definitely worth playing and experiencing what this game has to offer.",

            "review_text": "Incredibly pretty game in which you attempt to find your grandfather.  Some of the puzzles are really nice and there's very minimal hand holding. It's definitely worth clicking around and exploring everything. Right at the beginning you are provided with a book that actually contains the solutions to all the puzzles in the game. I actually found this a really interesting way to do a hint system, although less hint-y than outright solve-y. Nevertheless it is an 800+ page book filled with vast quantities of stuff. Despite this it is still reasonably easy to find the puzzles you are looking for if you get stuck (or just don't fancy faffing around with a bunch of gears again) whilst at the same time solutions to puzzles you haven't reached yet don't really stand out and spoiler themselves due to all the other info in there.  There are some points where your character will move from one place to another in sequences that are beautiful to watch the first time and then just rather annoying when you misclick and have to watch them wander back and fourth just to return you to where you already were. There are also a few times where clicking the exact right spot to get your character to move/interact with something feels a little sticky and fair warning I did experience one crash however the game's save system meant I didn't lose any progress.  Overall though, the puzzles are beautifully done and mostly have some lovely ideas behind them, the story is charming and the art style is just incredible. It is relatively short (4-5 hours), which I think puts the price point rather high - I know I would have missed out on this had it not come up in a bundle and that would have been a shame. Although I normally have no problem saying a game is not worth picking up at full price, there is something about this one that makes me think that for a lot of people it probably will be.",

A lot of the solutions are found in the journal you carry around with you, which felt like cheating to me, but it didn't seem like there was any other way to figure out what to do with some puzzles. This type of game is designed to be short, so it's hard to complain about the length, but I would definitely play more from this developer, for the creative design above all else.",

But overall, the puzzles and the complexity of them was just a perfect balance. Not too difficult, but almost all required you to think.  I did pick this up on sale. If it wasn't for that, I probably wouldn't have played it as I feel the current price is too high for an older game of this style.

This game is fun, the puzzles are a good difficulty and you have the answers if you can't work them out (but they aren't too bad, really.)  Good gameplay length, and of course the visual aspect is amazing. What a huge undertaking to build the models and film them, then incorporate them into the game.  The story is simple, but cute, and there are some cool bits dropped in to create depth about the city.  So yes, I loved playing it, and if you like puzzle games/arty games, I think you will too.  HOWEVER, there are a couple bummers:  1. The price tag is not worth the game, IMO. I got it on sale so I can't complain, but I would never pay $20 for this game. I personally think $10 is the most it should retail for. That said, I completely understand that the time and effort it took to build this game was huge, and the devs and creators deserve to be compensated. But it's still too high a price for the experience.  2. The game is buggy. I had freezes happen several times, and I had to restart the game and click differently next time. Also this one time I approached a puzzle and it was already solved...so that was a bummer.  3. Its also annoying that Lumi had to get all the way to her destination before you could move again. Not that big a deal, but at times I wouldn't know where I was allowed to go so I would click all over, and it would take me wayyy back to where I didn't necessarily want to be, and I couldn't stop her or redirect. Again, not too big a deal, but it did irk me a bit.  Anyway, if you are rich and have the money, or if it is on sale, yes, get it, play this game.  P.S. Lumi is kind of a ♥♥♥♥♥...  8/10 -Would steal bicycle again ",

The puzzles are fair. If you have to resort to a walkthrough, you won't be shaking your head, wondering how you were supposed to figure that out.  Cons: I said above that the puzzles are fair. But some of them are tough. At least, harder than I enjoyed. The in-game help system uses simple equations to give a page number in the manual that Lumi carries with her. For instance, 'Number of cogs x 100'; if there are three cogs in the puzzle that this refers to, the solution would be on page 300. But some of these clues are ambiguous: are you supposed to count the cogs that were already placed for you? Or just the ones you need to place yourself? And maybe it's not clear what constitutes a cog.  Bottom line: A fun puzzler with beautiful visuals.",

            "review_text": "Lumino City is a game about playfulness and curiosity, which is most apparent in its stunning visuals — the game world was built in papercraft and photographed, akin to pre-rendered backgrounds in the Playstation era, — but the gameplay underlines it just as well.  The player controls Lumi, a little girl trying to find her grandpa, who got abducted to Lumino City. The game is a point-and-click, featuring only a little bit of, mostly environmental, storytelling, but makes up for that with a lot of puzzles. The puzzles are challenging. You are rarely told what you have to do and sometimes information, crucial to the understanding of the puzzle, is hidden somewhere else. There is a section where an old man teaches Lumi a guitar song. The player has to memorize the notes and play them from memory afterwards. If you make a mistake, the old man will repeat the part you flunked, but you have to play through the entire piece at once, without any guidelines, if you want to proceed. Parts like these make me feel like I'm taking seriously. I don't need a pop-up telling me what to do, if I take longer than ten seconds to solve a puzzle and I don't need someone telling me exactly, where to click or which button to press, at any given moment.  And in case you really don't get the puzzle, there is a pretty clever way to give you a hint. At the start of the game, Lumi acquires the Handymanual, a book filled with hundreds of pages of strange gadgets sketches. On the second page is an index of equations, corresponding to the games puzzles. The needed parameters can be found in the surrounding area or the puzzle itself. The solution of an equation is the page number, where the puzzles solution is noted. Of course, no one tells you how the Handymanual is used; you are told how to open it, no more. I don't want to go into a lot of puzzle examples here. Finding things out for yourself is the most delightful part of this game — And I can assure you, every puzzle in this game can be solved by logical reasoning and only little trial-and-error.  With Lumino City, State of Play delivered a game of 'Why not?'. Why not hide puzzle solutions in a book several hundred pages book? Why not grow potatoes on the top of your roof? Why not combine a lighthouse with a windmill? Why not attach small houses to the side of a cliff? Just trying something out is fun and Lumino City conveys this message pretty well. While the game is linear in its core, the player has to be curious, play with the given appliances and ultimately find the path for himself. In my opinion, this is exactly how a puzzle game should be like.  Read more of my reviews at:  theguygaming.com ",

Clues are hidden in the Handy Manuel you're given in the beginning! Gameplay is fun and easy in some parts and little bit more challenging in other parts, a good mix. 11/10 would recommend.",
