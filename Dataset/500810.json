            "review_text": "Let's get this out of the way - Arcanum has horrible, horrible dungeons, combat sucks, the end game is a rushed boring crap and there's a bunch of bugs (so use the fan-patches).  Yet, it's one of my favorite RPGs - voted by the RPG Codex the #5 best RPG of all-time.  How so? Because it excels at everything else.   The world is amazing, a clash of medieval fantasy with the industrial revolution. More than just a nice background, it's used to offer an intriguing magic/technology duality and raise complex questions like 'should orcs receive equal pay to humans at factories?'  The classless character system is highly detailed and with several races, backgrounds, spells, skills, crafting recipes and technological schematics. You can play anything from a charismatic elven enchantress who relies on its 5 followers to a spiteful dwarf inventor, adventuring alone with his trusty flamethrower.  Moreover, the world will react to your choices. Expect to suffer racism if you play as orc or half-ogre, to be expelled from trains if you play a mage (who cares, you can teleport!), to be banned from men's clubs if you play a women, etc...  Quests are amazing. To hell with the 'kill 5/5 X' MMO-ish garbage push out today, Arcanum has you investigating murders and rumors, debating economics and politics, dealing with prejudice and racism, etc. And they often have multiple solutions. Need to solve a murder? If you're a necromancer, why not raise the victim's spirit and ask him directly? FINALLY A GAME THAT UNDERSTANDS MAGIC!  Then there's the beautiful soundtrack, the gorgeous grid-based inventory with detailed artwork &amp; item descriptions, the clever plot twists, the countless role-plying opportunities, the reactive companions, Tarant - the best city in any RPG... hell, this is a game where you can complete a quest and read about it the next day on the city's newspapers!   Arcanum is easily one of the most ambitious games ever made. Building upon what Fallout 1 &amp; 2 did, it showed players just how rich, reactive and interesting an RPG could really be.   It has many failings, but no other game ever came close to its successes.",

            "review_text": "Arcanum is one of those gems you pick up and never forget. It is a classic RPG style of game play with a deep twisting story line. It was one of the best RPG rides of all time.  Guns and Magic, steamworks, crafting, gnomes, elves an orcs, open world environment etc this game simply crammed everything you want in an RPG And still found room for a brothel with a sheep in it for your peculiar tastes.  Do not Alt-Tab, this game hates it.  Thank you Steam, I had been preserving some very old game discs for some classics that I love. I can now get rid of one more set of game discs on my shelf. Highly Recommend this to anyone who is a classic RPG fan. ",

            "review_text": "Arcanum is a classic RPG, with excellent writing, and a unique fantasy-steampunk setting where technology and magic clash. The character creation is superb and leaves you with many different ways to play through the game, with such fantastic backgrounds as 'special person', running away with the circus, beat with an ugly stick, charlatans protege, and many more that are quite unique. This all leads up to multiple ways to solve problems, and not everything is accessable with just one character like many RPG's today. If you have played the original Fallout games, and somehow passed over this, then it is worth a look.  That said, it does have its downsides, it was buggy at release, and still has a few today. The combat can be switched from real time to turn based, and as a result can be unbalanced in one or the other in differing situations, and it leaves the animations are a little clunky.  All in all, I wouldn't recommend it to everybody, but if you are down here reading the reviews its worth it to get lost in the world for a few hours. Definitely a memorable experience, and it holds up, despite its flaws.",

            "review_text": "I finished Arcanum for at least 4 times. Everytime I did though, it was a different experience. This game gives you so much room for roleplaying that it makes your tabletop games look like hack'n slashes. From a herbalist healer, to a psychopath, from a witty magical thief to a brute who can't even properly speak. Literally, anything that comes to your mind.  You can finish this game by killing everyone, or you can finish it without even raising your fists. Everything is up to how you want your character to interact with the rich world around them.   A lot of quests have more than one solution, and by more than one I don't mean some shallow choices like 'pickpocket or kill'. There are real moral choices in even the simplest quests.   Arcanum is not only about what you do, but how you do and why you do. The interaction with the other characters is so deep just visiting a tavern and mingling with other people can be a tremendous experience.  Being ugly, being mentally challenged, being vicious, being polite, being sickly, being misanthropic, being seductive... everything is a unique experience in this game. Don't afraid of being experimental in creating your character, be an ugly but charismatic negotiator, be a short tempered gambling addict who kills people when he loses, be a mad scientist who experiments his new electric gun on village folk because hey, who cares about a small village when we are talking about scientific progression? Whatever you be, the game finds a way to acknowledge and reward you for your roleplay.  10/10 one of the best rpg's ever made.",

I wanted this game long before been released (at that time, we readed for the new games in journals) and i was aware, that this is going to be a good game, but not even close to the what comes next. I want Arcanum II. Just because i played this so much, that i know everything, and its not a challenge anymore, but i still played it. Because i love the world, the leveling the choises, the details and mechanics, the NPC, The weapons, quests, story, cityes, secerts... No need to speak more, if you want old but good game (they dont make them anymore like this) and you dont know Arcanum, or didn't play... Now is the time. Don't miss it. The outdated graphic is forgetable in the moment you enter in to the story and listen the soundtrack. I dare you.",

But one day my PC crashed horribly and fried the CD :(   This game makes a whole lot of fun, its graphics are nothing for a spoiled kiddo that just plays 'teh best graphicz gamez' but its storyline, way of playing is a gem for every RPG player!   You can choose between two major paths, technology or magic. If you choose technology and progress further and further in it magic will have less and less of an impact on you. Meaning also positive spells like revive or healing. If you progress further into magic you can use some technology items, but you can hurl powerful spells at the enemies (dont worry, as far as i can remember even robots get blown to pieces by you spells, the technology affinity is just implemented for players i guess). If you want to you can also play a hybrid to combine the best of both ways, but you better know what you do.  Sadly the mutliplayer has just one real map as far as i know and if you finished it once you know the tricks and can finish it again. But before you finish it is a major adventure where you need high pathfinding skills for one area.  All in all a very awesome game which i can only recommend for any RPG player.",

Like a lot of people i buy H.B. games as a pack because i want some of the games, but not all. I will play for 5 minutes (or a little bit more) and give you my opinion on it. Sometimes the game will surprise me, sometimes it will be a total disappointment. Just keep in mind this is my opinion only and is not an objective view of the game. You might actually like it!  The review will be constructed into 5 parts: 1. Game description (from what I’ve seen in the time I’ve played). 2. Did i finish the game (YES/NO/Maybe in the future) and why. 3. Pros/Cons. 4. Final thoughts. 5. Rating  So let's begin...  1. Game description:  A classical RPG with big character development and an isometric view. It has some steampunk elements thrown in. The gameplay is what you would expect from a game this age, a little clunky by modern standards.  2. Did i finish the game? NO/ Maybe in the future  I like RPG’s, however the same thing happened when I played for the first time fallout 1 a couple of years ago. The mechanics and graphics where just to outdated for me. Maybe I will finish it someday for the story, but that is very unlikely.  3. Pros/Cons.  PROS: - Classical RPG – big nostalgia value for someone who played it when it was released. - Nice athosphere  CONS: - Outdated graphics and controls   4. Final thoughts:  Bought this with the Sierra Bundle. It wasn't a game i played when i was little so i don't have any emotional atachment to it. If you like classical RPG and aren’t bothered by the outdated controls, go for it. It just wasn’t for me…  5. Rating  5/10",

I don't know how many hours I spent on this in my teen years, but I know I'll eventually spend a lot more on this new version.   Only one complaint: it is impossible at the moment to play this game in a window and with the right resolution without using mods. I personally cant stand using mods, but for some people this might not be a problem. I also hear it doesn't run that great on Windows 10 but since I don't have it, I can only speak for Windows 7 users.   Definitely worth buying at full price.",
