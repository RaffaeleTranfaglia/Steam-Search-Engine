    "description": "The story is situated on Mars. It starts where UFO: Aftermath left off and runs simultaneously with UFO: Aftershock. While the Laputans on Earth are fighting Wargots and Starghosts and finding out what caused the destruction of their home planet, a small colony on Mars is trying to survive and flourish.",

They're just some casual kids that don't know how to play a genuinely good game. This review right here is the way to go, coming from a true XCOM and UFO fan, telling you that this game is the real deal. One of my favorite games of all time.",

BUT, it's EXTREMELY fun. You can plan out all your actions, and then let your troops execute them. The amount of content is staggering, and the game does get slightly repetetive, but so does normal XCOM. A worthy successor of the XCOM series. Most of the negative reviews are due to the different gameplay style, but when you get past that you get a very, very intriguing offspring of the XCOM series. And it's only seven USD, so why the hell not? Buy this game, and enjoy it. I sure have",

I missed playing a game that opens with a sucker punch, hits below the belt then proceeds to kick you while your down.   its old, but massively fun. I am enjoying this much more than the newest xcom and all of its updates etc. but thats my opinion.  hope to see something like this or Emperor of the Fading Suns in the future... but doubt any company will take a chance like that even though there are rabid fans waiting for it.  so if your thinking about it, check this game out on youtube. that will let you know if you would like it. enjoy.",

UFO: Afterlight runs so well that it can be switched between windowed and fullscreen without any problem, and the game will never crash. This game is a must-own for those who want to experience X-COM before it was good without playing a bad game.",

It's worth playing through, and is significantly better than most alien games, but still doesn't live up to X Com",
