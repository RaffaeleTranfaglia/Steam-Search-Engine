I haven't hit any bugs yet, although I understand others have. The non epic player character approach and no requirement to grind for days to get something worthwhile is a nice change. That said, it is a casual game, definently not trying to be a Diablo clone.",

            "review_text": "Well its a good concept, but the idea kinda falls flat with this game. not enought content for the price... and its only $10! I usually rate games based on how much i play them, even after winning 'the game'. so 100 hours in a $40 game is a good buy for me. this game just lacks the content to keep me entertained even for $10. there is 'challange' mode.. but why? it doesn't even work how I wished it would, there is no 'endless' mode, witch there is a BUTTON for it after you win every map, but you can't do it!? but I dont really even see a point in that, most games i have build everything there is to build by the end of the map and i'm just mashing 'next wave' due to boredom killing wild life. I want more buildings, higher level upgrades, bigger waves, catastrophic death!  its fun for what it is, just need about another year of development before 'fun'.",
