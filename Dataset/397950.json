            "review_text": "This is one of the most wildly original games I have seen in a long time.  Clustertruck's basic premise is this: you run and jump across the back of trucks that are speeding down various landscapes. Your objective is to get to the goal by any means necessary. But if you touch anything or bump anything that isn't a truck (well, almost anything), you fail and have to restart the level. It sounds hard, and it is hard, but it's also crazy fun. There's no feeling like being absolutely certain you're about to fail and then somehow turning it around into a victory.  To help matters, you earn points as you play and you can use them to buy abilities. These abilities range from things like double jump and slowing down time to making the game play like SUPERHOT. They're all interesting and offer ridiculous new ways to tackle levels.  Now some might be upset with the fact that you can pretty much see all the levels in just 2-3 hours, but the levels that are there are great. They start off fairly tame, easing you into the game and letting you get a handle on how it all works. But the game gradually ramps up the difficulty, adding new and crazier things as the levels go on. You get lasers, boulders, trucks falling from the sky, trucks being shot out of cannons at you, missile launching turrets, and more. And I found all the levels to be fun.  Well, except for the final level. I won't spoil what it is, but those who have gotten there will know what I'm talking about.  Here's the thing: Clustertruck is built around speed. It's all about getting things done as fast as you can, and the levels reflect that. Each one can usually be completed in 10-20 seconds at most. But then the final level comes along, and it forces you to play for at least two minutes. And if you slip up, make a mistake, and fail? Well you're back at the beginning. And it quickly gets frustrating. The concept is cool, and an interesting variation on the tradition levels, but in the end it just makes the tiny flaws in Clustertruck suddenly become all the more glaring. The momentum can be wonky as you jump from truck to truck. The inherent randomness in the game means that the trucks can act unpredictably. And if that happens at the wrong time, you die because of it. These flaws normally don't mean much because of how fast each level is, but the final level can become insanely frustrating as you continually retry it over and over just trying to get back to where you were.  Despite all that, Clustertruck is a great game and I highly recommend it. It's one of the most creative game ideas I've ever seen. And it's only the final level that annoyed me. The rest could be challenging, but they were still fun. That being said, if you don't think fifteen bucks is worth only a few hours of content, then I'd wait for a sale. Either way, it'll certainly be one of the most unique games you ever purchase.  EDIT: I just found out that the developers made the final level a little shorter to alleviate some of the frustration. Good on them. I'm glad they listen to feedback unlike some in the industry.",

            "review_text": "Game: Clustertruck Developer: Landfall Games Publisher: tinyBuild Released: September 27th, 2016 Review Date: October 14th, 2016 Genre: Action, Indie Release Day Price: $14.99 USD  A bit of a bias going in and I thought I should clarify that I have been following the development of this game since it was called by a different name, Highway Fight Squad, and with each new teaser posted to the subreddit, I got more and more interested in playing it. One of my favorite YouTubers, Muselk, got a pre-alpha copy and I wanted it even more. Once the invite alpha was released for testing last year, I jumped right on it. I have been hooked ever since. However, I will try not to let any of that get in the way of my honest review.  I have been playing the full Steam version for two weeks now, and here is my opinion on the game.  So what is this Clustertruck game about? Well, it's about bouncing from truck to truck to reach the end goal without touching the ground or obstacles. There are a certain amount of trucks per level and their movements, as well as some of the state hazards, are almost entirely purely RNG. It's really just that simple. Sounds boring, right? Well, not entirely. The physics of the game are very fine-tuned, the learning curve can get quite steep while remaining fun and engaging, and the things that are thrown at you get more and crazier as you go. You also unlock abilities as you go. A lot of player feedback, my own included, went into this game, and it shows. It is much better now than in the alpha stage.  It's a very engaging game from the start and holds you hand a bit at the beginning, but not for very long. The only way to continue to the next level is to well, for lack of a better phrase, git gud. The controls are very responsive and intuitive. The physics have their issues, but they're mostly predictable. Sometimes RNG can screw you, other times it can work in your favor. So how does this become fun? Well, because the game never stops being a challenge, really. Once you master one thing, you have to master a new thing, and that's how you are progressed through the game. There is no story. There is no plot. It's just you, trucks, and physics, and I love the simplicity of it. There is a final boss so to speak, but there is no expansion on it. It's just there. I don't even think it needs an explanation really.  Is there replayability, you might ask? Well sort of. You can get an achievement for beating every single level of the game, final boss included, with no abilities. That sounds like it would be a cake walk but believe me; it's increasingly difficult to do. You will probably also beat the game and still have some abilities left to unlock. You can use two abilities at a time and beating the game with a different pair is also a very fun experience in experimentation. You can also race your friend’s ghosts and beat their times, which there is an achievement for as well. Additionally, there is plenty of Steam Workshop user submitted levels ranging from a 1-1 Super Mario Bros. clone, to the Big Balls stage from Wipeout, to the first Ninja Warrior course, all three are really fun to try and complete. After you beat the game and unlock all abilities there is currently nothing more to spend your hard earned points on, but hopefully that will be addressed further down the road with DLC or new ability unlocks.  All of that said there are still some bugs in the game. One that lets people exploit some aspects of the physics to beat a level in around 2 seconds for instance which isn't a major issue if you are not going for a top of the leaderboard time. There is a function you can map to a button called 'sprint' and at this time there is no auto-sprint option so you'll constantly have to hold down the sprint button if you want speed. Landfall Games is aware of both of these issues and are working on them. They're very engaging with the community and I love that about them.  Is it perfect? No.  Is it very original? Not really. Is it fun? Hell yes!  Is it worth replaying? Very much so! Is it worth the price? Absolutely, but with Steam's Fall Sale coming up, I would hold off until then just to grab it for a bit less.   I give Clustertruck an 8/10 which is a very good score from me for an indie game. I would only give it a 7/10 because of the amount of bugs, but Landfall Games is extremely engaging and talks to their communities and a lot of fixes are already in the works and they have delivered huge amounts of bug fixes already.  My recommendation? Buy it!",

            "review_text": "Unlike No Man's Sky, this game did not disappoint. It advertised high-speed truck-jumping fun, and that is exactly what it provided.  Advertising: Spot-on  The visuals are pretty, the game runs surprisingly smooth on my cruddy computer and okayish laptop (at least with graphics settings set to performance &gt; quality). But honestly, you're here for a cluster♥♥♥♥ of trucks, not a cluster♥♥♥♥ of particle effects.  Graphics: Who cares, it's trucks  The controls are very smooth and responsive, although sometimes you can slip and slide around on trucks instead of landing and jumping off of them because the game doesn't detect you achieving a 'landing' state on them, which can get a little annoying. But it only happens if you're going really fast and on sloped trucks.   One thing to note about the physics of the controls:  The game is extremely biased to forward momentum.  Strafing side to side while flying between trucks is a pretty good way to kill your momentum, and holding back is literally your mid-air brake-on-a-dime. But this isn't that hard to get used to as long as you just keep this in mind, and try looking where you want to go instead of air-strafing. I can best describe it as the polar opposite of TF2's rocket jumping mechanics, if you're familiar with those.   Controls: It's alright, maybe a little less butter would do  The game features 80+ levels spanning across many worlds, which is honestly pretty short for it's price point, even if I did preorder it for $12. As for the gameplay, I haven't had this much fun playing a game since Super Smash Bros 4 came out. It is extremely fun to play with, and once you get the hang of it, it's super difficult to break the habit of flipping around and jumping off the sides and backs of trucks at high speeds, especially when you nail that golden angle and complete the level in a stylish way. Makes me wish there were replays of some sort.  Oh, and did I mention that the game doesn't have a Y axis lock on your camera movement? You can do frontflips, backflips, and even play a level upside down while facing the wrong way if you wanted to.  Gameplay: Seems like a rage game on the outside, but on the inside it's the dynamic younger brother of Mirror's Edge  The year is 20XX. Trucks have overrun the planet and outnumbered humanity itself. Though that shouldn't come to a surprise, seeing as you're apparently the only human left. That shouldn't come as a surprise either, seeing as not only the floor, but  virtually everything except a truck is lava,  and the reason you're the last living human left is because because apparently you were the one human that was standing on top of a truck at the time of the Atruckalypse.  Story: I made that up, there isn't a story  The music is ungodly. I can't stress that enough.  Music: Yes + Yup = I love it  All in all, Clustertruck is an excellent game. It falls a bit short (literally), but I had an absolute blast playing it. Which I can't say for a lot of games. Devs, you keep doing the good. I'll keep doing the truckour. For our peoples. I mean trucks. For our trucks.",

            "review_text": "If there was a Maybe option for reviews, this would be it. I only recommend this when it's on sale.  Clustertruck is a fun, simple game based on jumping on trucks, and is executed well enough to not suffer from its simplicity. It has good music and a sharp, aesthetically pleasing visual style. However, it suffers from a number of critical issues as of launch:   Short campaign, easily beatable in a few hours. One of the most interesting levels in the game is the very last one, mostly because it uses mechanics seen nowhere else in the campaign; the other levels would have benefited from having similar mechanics included.   Poor performance on mid-tier and specific high-tier computers; my FPS will either be a smooth 60 or a stuttering 40-50, sometimes dipping as low as 20. This also impacts the control of the game and makes it hard to line up some jumps.   Very floaty, spongy physics with weird inertia that feels awkward and unmanageable until you get used to it. Once you get used to it, the controls usually work pretty well.   Some upgrades allow for easy completion of the campaign levels in likely unintentional ways, which results in large gaps in time on the leaderboards;  I managed to get first place on 7:3 using one of them , and the other legitimate top scores also made use of similar techniques as seen with their ghosts.   Speaking of the leaderboards, there's already exploited and cheated times on the leaderboards, with one specific user getting a blazing fast record of 0:00:00 in every campaign level (as seen in the above link).   It tries to be a game about speedrunning with a leaderboard, but you can't make strats because everything is based on finnicky, widely varying physics and you can easily get lucky or abuse the physics to beat someone's time. It tries to be a fun party game that you can pick up, play, and laugh at, but there's no multiplayer and there's not enough campaign levels for it to last longer than a few hours unless you play user-created levels.  Again, the game is solid aside from these points and is still pretty fun, but the problems it has really holds it back from its full potential. I would recommend it on sale, maybe $5 or so, but certainly not $15.",

            "review_text": "Clustertruck is a fantastic idea on paper. You scoot around at incredible speed and jump from the backs of one truck onto the next truck. The Trucks behave somewhat randomly, and explosions and truck crashes happen.  However, I found the gameplay loop to be predominately about repeating mundane jumps over and over again hoping that the truck RNG allows one to be positioned somewhere you can go. Even in the earlier levels trucks randomly swerving sideways without warning (while you're droping onto them), sudden truck pileups on even the slightest obsticals, and my personal favorite of the player's momentum not working quite properly as they slide right off of the truck they tried to land on, all contribute to a solid MEH experience. Frustration is based almost entirely on two factors: 1. not being omnipotent about the level design coming ahead (leading inevitably to a repeat) and 2. The RNG stranding you on a truck that is driving off map into the far distance or directly into a game ending obstical.  The platforming is floaty but rewarding at first, and the difficulty creeps upwards at a modest pace. However, the RNG is what determines a good run vs a bad run, and you're going to have levels where you repeatedly end up playing again and again and again. Sliding around, falling in gaps, and hitting questionably sized hitboxes on obsticals leads to many repeats and it starts wearing out the game's intial charm very quickly.  There is an Upgrade system, however you'd need to play enough of the game at a decent technical proficiency and with good RNG to successfully get any of the upgrades within your playtime. Also, the Double Jump is just pathetic. Aside from that, it appears that the online leaderboards are jacked up- or I didn't get far enough to unlock the ability to have a clear time of literally 00:00:00.000.  In short: Floaty platformer with indie charm that relies too heavily on RNG to make its rudimentary platforming interesting. Upgrades contribute to some continued enjoyment, but the game itself is mostly cute rather than serious about keeping its playerbase. If rated on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being nonfunctional garbage and 10 being some kind of gaming revolution, I'd give it about a 4. It's not offensive, but just doesn't seem to work that well for anything beyond the charm of RNG-AI Truck Based Platforming.",

The game has a total of 90 levels (100 if you count seasonals) and 9 worlds. Each world has their own obstacles and gimmicks (dont worry, they are good gimmicks) which stops the game from getting old. And while most workshop levels are terrible, some are really good and well made. Landfall Games will (hopefully) keep giving us seasonal updates, which give the workshop even more tools to work with.  Let's talk about how the game isnt actually 5 hours only.   Reason #1: Abilities - Basically, there are a lot of unique abilities and you can try different combinations 'n stuff. Some abilities (super truck especially) change the gameplay up a lot, so you can replay levels without it feeling stale.  Reason #2: Speedrunning - There are leaderboards, and yes, most of them are cheaters that beat the level in 1 second, but you can still try climbing the leaderboards. Doing that alone gave me a good 3 more hours.  Reason #3: Updates - Landfall are (hopefully) going to keep giving us seasonal stuff.  Reason #4: The Pure achievement - The achievement titled: 'Pure' gave me 6 more hours alone. To get the achievement, you must beat the game without any abilities, which, believe me, is really difficult.

Plus you earn points for like how fast you completed a level and if you did any 'tricks' and you can then use those points that will change the gameplay like unlocking a grapple hook or being able to do a second jump ect. So yeah I have really enjoyed what I have played so far (currently put about 30 mins into the game because it was just released)its seriously addictive like it makes you want to play level after level and also fyi I am playing on a laptop and it runs really well.

It was only in September I learned it had been running on intergrated graphics. I booted it up on a proper graphics card, and probably put about ten hours into it. I wouldn't have been surprised if it was non-stop.  What I wanted from Clustertruck was more. The alpha had about twenty levels, I think, and the SUPERTRUCK April Fools joke added a few more. But, I wanted more. More abilities. More maps. They'd perfected the formula, and I wanted more of it.  And God Damn did they deliver.  First off, there's a full 90 levels. Each one has a special twist and they rarely feel the same. There's many more abilities (I can't recall the number) and it just feels BRILLIANT. There's also a level editor, and some interesting levels  The graphics are gorgeous. The bloom, the vibrance, it helps give off the exact vibe the level wants to evoke. Music is fantastic, and I wasn't expecting different tracks. The alpha only had one track, and I would be perfectly fine if the full game had one track. But I vastly prefer the music they have now. Like the graphics, it really does evoke the feel of the level.  Gameplay is arguably the most important factor in Clustertruck. You can have a perfectly good amount of fun for £11, but here's a tip from me- try to speedrun this game. You'll be holding down shift a lot more, leaping and running along the side of things you thought you never could, having moments where you wish somebody was recording you, seeing the pros complete levels in a matter of seconds* and trying to get close to their level and maybe, just someday, surpassing them. That's the gameplay. But what makes the gameplay so, so, SO GREAT is the feel. The camera shakes are wonderful. If you land on a truck far away from your original starting point, you'll shake a bit. You get points for doing all kinds of crazy ♥♥♥♥, and the camera shakes as your total score increases. Plus, you also unlock abilities from the points gained in levels, so it practically encourages you to do crazy ♥♥♥♥. True, you could grind, or get better. That learning curve is fair, let me tell you that.  So, does the game have any downsides?  This is where that * comes in. *Some people have been hacking 0:00 times in, so that sucks.  TL;DR Game is amazing. Fun, wacky, perfected to such a precise point, and definitely, DEFINITELY worth the money it's asking. If you like music, I can also recommend the soundtrack, but you can listen to it in game, if you don't mind the sound of a right Clustertruck behind you.",

For all it's bugs/glitches (Did I mention my achievements don't work?), it really is an awesome game. It's hard as nails but you never really feel 'frustrated' when you lose for the 1000th time, you just wanna keep playing, keep beating your friends' times (You're going down Lucas), keep getting better and better.

But, I can safely say this game is worth it. It's an odd mix of chaos, parkour, and speedrunning.   Some levels are panic driven to just get to the end, and others are almost puzzle-like with it's layout. The puzzles are not my favorite, but they're unique and interesting. Note, that there isn't many complicated moves in this game, its only jumping off trucks plus the various abilities (That don't feel overpowered, but fun to use and mostly utility). There will be less moves than other parkours games, and bears more of a resemblence to platformers. The gameplay doesn't get too stale, as abilities add new aspects and strategies, and new mechanics are introduced regulaurly throughout the campaign. There is also a 'ghost' mechanic, that lets you view the path through levels that you, your friends, or the best time globally used while you complete the level.  Overall, I'd recommend this game to anyone who thinks the concept of Clustertruck would be enjoyable as it is well executed. ",

There is a factor of randomness to each instance of the level that no two playthroughs of a single level are the same. It will occasionally screw you, I love it. Glad I saw this at PAX, and at this price you would regret picking it up.",

            "review_text": "If you're even moderately good at platformers or reaction games, you'll probably be able to beat all of the official levels (105 in total at the time of writing--90 in the campaign, 10 in the Halloween update, and 5 in the Holiday update) in just a few hours (it took me about 3 1/2 myself). The real value comes in when you get into user made content and high score hunting. There are also plenty of powerups to unlock, which allows you to replay old levels with a new feel.  As for the gameplay itself, it's VERY enjoyable. The controls are responsive, there are few glitches to be found, and things are generally pretty fair so far as hit detection and the like go. This is one of the least frustrating games I've ever played, as you get to respawn instantly and your deaths are usually so hilarious that you're too busy laughing to get upset.  On the whole, this is a gem. For $15, it's a good deal. For the sale price of $9 that I paid, it's an excellent one. If you like games that push the boundaries of a concept and take it to strange places then you should definitely give this game a shot.",

Its a great feeling jumping trough a level at full speed, catching the edge of the last truck and going on, beating a level you died hundreds of times in.  The only small downside to it is the fact, that i needed only 2h to beat the campaign (and both seasonal campaigns), but now i'm gonna try to beat it without abilities. And thanks to the workshop there are going to be more levels to explore.  I think the price is on point and i dont regret throwing in 5€ more to get the soundtrack either.  Overall: A huge fun clustertruck.  EDIT: Just played through it a second time without ablities and i have to say its a pretty fun challenge and everyone should at least try it. It took obviously more time then the first playtrough and you should prepare to cry a little but it is worth it.",

            "review_text": "  Clustertruck   is a neat experience with a unique game feel, worth exploring, which moves towards a fluid, truck-hopping intensity that held my attention for hours.   With that said, however, I think it is fundamentally too short. Barely passing the refund time were I satisfied with a single playthrough, I set about completing the achievements on offer and the Halloween/Christmas content they've added to the game since its initial Steam release: in total, I spent an approximate 6 hours completing the campaign twice, and I have to wonder if it's worth the $15 price tag. I picked it up for $7.50 in the Winter sale, and I think for that it was an 'okay' deal - enough that'll I recommend it, but I really would like to see more levels in the campaign fleshed out with exciting concepts. The developers seem somewhat stuck for ideas, relying mostly on flatground and simple jumping puzzles - the few levels that did employ slopes felt incredibly clunky, with trucks kicking you off their back awkwardly, and both of the additional content conclusionary maps were 'dodge this preset order of incoming lazers / fireghosts and get to the end of the straight path,' and only a few levels really use enjoyable mid-air truck-hopping.   There is much untapped potential for gameplay variation, but the game itself feels awkward whenever it attempts to incorporate change: for instance, a lot of the difficult of the last (and only) 'boss,' in terms of time, comes from the player re-associating their control over the truck-hopping character with a permanent left-leaning slant as they go up the   only   strictly circular road in the game.    The prospect of an active Workshop community further sold me that there would be more to the game, even as I smashed through the campaign, but I haven't found anything overly redeemable - at least not yet. This isn't too big of a condemnation, as it's always fantastic to see workshop integration - included directly in the client itself, no less, but If that's something that interests you, as a way of extending the title, or is characterising your window-shopping interest with the game, give it some time. The devs seem willing to continue modifying and adding to the game, so I've faith that at some point it will feel like something I recommend without much more thought. As yet, though, I felt these paragraphs were necessary before I'd hit the thumbs-up. :)",
