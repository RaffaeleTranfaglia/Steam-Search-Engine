You pass through the first levels very quickly, then the extreme levels come on, the blades start to spin, pop in and out of the circles, the whole world starts to distort. oO is a rage inducing, fast paced game, You are a little white circle, making your way out of the death ridden area.  It reminds me of the 2002 web game where you beat the hell out of your computer. Makes me feel the same way. Overall, its a fun game!  I give it 7.5/10.",

First stage is quite easy but at later levels things such as moving spikes and timed spikes (they disappear and reappear in a certain pattern).  After beating a level you can try a twisted version of it where everything is wobbly and non-circular.  Endless mode is quite fun and is randomized every try. You can get a super lucky run and easily get 100 points or you can get a super hard run and have trouble getting 6 points.  Oh, and fourth level will destroy you.",

I also feel like there are too little checkpoints. It happens too often that I try to get through a part but it just won't happen, then I finally get through it only to die a few seconds later without ever seeing a checkpoint.  And then there is the input lag. This game is all about perfect timing. Got you timing 1% off? Too bad, try again. The problem is that there is a small amount of input lag (very small amount, that usually won't be noticable), which is really bad in this type of game.  Pros: Good visuals Decent soundtrack  Neutral: Interesting game mechanics at first, but turns into frustration later  Cons: Very frustrating Input lag  Overall I wouldn't recommend this game (not even for this price) because of the frustration and the input lag.",
