'You can't smoke in here,' says Old Man Tower Defense. Dungeon of the Endless puts out his cigarette on the old man's face and steals his style.  'Get lost,' says Dungeon of the Endless, and Old Man Tower Defense shuffles back to his room at the old genres' home.  4X Strategy Nerd is walking down the hall as Dungeon of the Endless walks out of the bathroom, smelling like bathroom soap and Camels. DotE shakes him down for his gameplay elements and stuffs him in a locker.  After school, DotE hangs out with his friend Ritchie 'Rogue-Like' Valens.  'I wanna put a band together,' says DotE.  'Yeah? Watcha thinkin?' says Ritchie.  'I got all these things I stole from people at school,' says DotE.  Ritchie looks at these Tower Defense elements and these 4X strategy elements and wonders if it could work. He looks at DotE and sees that look in his face - if he could trick Principal RTS into eating fifteen cans of Spam to get people to believe in base-building and resource management again, he could do this.  'Yeah. Yeah,' says Ritchie. 'It'll take some thinking, but we could make this work.'",

            "review_text": "Dungeon of the Endless (DoTE) is a strange mix of genres that works surpisingly well. Part tower defence, part squad management and part roguelike.  DoTE presents an interesting dilemma for the player; should I open this door? Ever door you open has the chance to make your escape to the next floor harder. Every room you don't run power too, and very rarely will you have enough power for every room, has a chance to spawn hordes of aleins who want you dead. You can slow their assault by building towers in powered rooms. You must also choose which resources to generate so you can afford more towers, tower upgrades or character levels. Everything in DoTE comes down to a simple choice: how hard do I want to make this for myself? All of this, with a helping of humour and increasing difficulty results in very rewarding risk/reward gameplay.  There is a wealth of characters in DoTE, all with their own strengths and weaknesses. Their combined flavour texts makes for an interesting narrative and the various interactions between the characters in the post level screen is a very nice touch and makes the world feel alive. You will rectuit additional squad members the deeping you dive into the dungeon, but you will have to decide who to sacrafice in order to create room for them as you can onyl have 4 squad members. Even unlocking new characters for future playthroughs has a risk/reward aspect to it as you must dive at least 3 floors into the dungeon with your new compainion before they are available to you for other playthroughs.   The only downsides to DoTE are in the multiplayer. At the time of writing this here are my issues:   You cannot create private multiplayer matches. This has resulted in me kicking many people (sorry!) when I only wanted to play with a friend.    You cannot trade items between player's characters outside of selling the items to the shop keeper and having them buy them.    The game tends to drop connections often and you cannot rejoin a game which effectively ends it.    You cannot save your progress in a multiplayer game and a game of DoTE can take a few hours so make sure you have nothing else you need to do before you start a game up.   I hope that the devs iron out the technical issues so that multiplayer can be a more enjoyable experience.  In conclusion, I would highly reccomend this game despite its flaws in multiplayer. If you like rogue-likes and tower defence games you should definitely try this one out. It is a steal at only $14 (CAD) and some of the most fun I have had with a game in recent memory!  TL;DR: Rogue-Like, Squad Management, Tower Defence. Very fun. Very cheap. Broken multiplayer. Go buy now.",

            "review_text": "If you don't feel like reading the entire things here's the summary: As with any game, keep in mind that this may not be the right combination of elements for you. I'd say if you enjoy tower defense games, roguelike mechanics, science fiction settings, and a subtle sense of humour, there is a high probability that you will enjoy this one. If you get easily frustrated or like strategy based only on skill, without an element of luck, perhaps this is not the game for you.   Personally, I love this game. It has all the right ingredients for me, and it's quickly become a favourite. I can't praise it enough.   Good points:   +Solid design and game mechanics. +Beautiful pixel art. +Immersive soundtrack and sound effects. +Great characters and subtle humour. +Endless replayability. Every game is different, and every combination of heroes and items will make you rethink your approach. +Good time versatility: you can either pick it up for half an hour or half a day. Though a complete run will require several hours to complete, once you know the game mechanics it's relatively easy to pick up a game partway through. +Relatively frequent updates. In a time where far too many games get abandoned in Early Access stage, finding developers that actually listen to the players and release updates seems such a rarity!   Possible caveats:   -I have not tested the multiplayer  (The general consensus seems to be that it still needs some work. Same with some crashing issues. The developers seem to be aware and working on it.)  -Difficulty spike towards the later levels. Even the easiest settings can be very, very challenging. This may make the game feel unbalanced. -On that same note, bear in mind that you require both skill and luck to win the game.   These points are not a problem for me, I've played old school roguelikes and this one feels pretty forgiving in comparison, but it may not be everyone's cup of tea. A bad combination of items, heroes or rooms, and your late game may become nearly impossible. A good one, and you can win with much less effort (though a certain degree of skill is a must, and you will still be punished quite severely for acting foolishly or carelessly).  I do like that element of luck, and find that any frustration vanishes fairly quickly in the face of the next challenge (a rarity for me these days, as I don't have much free time and seem to have grown old and grumpy when it comes to frustrating games). I find luck a perk, rather, something that distinguishes this game from other roguelikes, and I think the immersion really helps, in my case.   -Some extra content is unlocked separately  I'm making a note of this because I've seen some nasty comments around. There is a special edition of the game (crystal pack) that unlocks an extra character and ship, but if you want the other extra character and ship you have to buy the special edition of Endless Legend, as well. I believe that the developers plan to later unlock this content, but are giving this option now for early supporters of their games, which I think is a fair strategy. I think this is much preferable to standard DLC, in any case. Your opinion may differ, so I think it is fair to give a warning.  (Edited to correct a sneaky typo!) (Update November 2016: yep, still playing and loving it! :) )",

            "review_text": "This is a unique cross between tower defense, 4X, and rogue-like game.  You have 1 to 4 heroes that explore a random dungeon consisting of rooms separated by doors. Every time you open a door, monsters spawn in all the unlit areas of the dungeon and try to attack your heroes and reach your base. You can stop them by attacking with your heroes or building defenses.  After the wave of monsters is done, you are safe and may build or upgrade your structures. This phase plays a lot like a 4X game where you must manage food, research, and industry. Each room can a certain number of structures of various types, and some rooms contain existing structures.  Your heroes themselves level up and gain skills as they would in an RPG. Death is permanent and when all your heroes die, you must restart the game from scratch.  There is a huge amount of replayability here due to the random elements and number of ships and characters you can choose. A typical game can take 3-4 hours.  As with roguelikes this is fairly difficult game, particularly if you play it on the harder difficulty (there are two difficilties, mislabelled 'easy' and 'very easy'). If you enjoy difficult games, you should like this a lot.   Subscribe to my curator page here    View my other reviews here ",

            "review_text": "Fantastic approach to dungeon crawling with some unusual gameplay mechanics featuring semi-turn based tactics and micro-management.  I could call this game 'a mix between a party dungeon crawler and a tower defense' but that wouldn't cover all this game has to offer.   You start off selecting a 'crew' which is to land inside a planet's randomly generated dungeon. Your crew is consisted of 2 to 4 heroes, which have their own skills, stats, intentory, background story and dialogue. Upon landing you explore the dungeon by opening doors to other rooms, which are hidden in a fog of war, until you open them. Every door opening counts as a turn. Each turn you gain resources, which you can then spend on: building modules which generate more resources or assist your heroes in various ways; constructing turrets and such in rooms you have already visited and sent power to; shopping for equipment and leveling up your heroes. Your ultimate goal is to find an exit/elevator on each floor and to deliver the 'crystal' you start off with in a first room to the elevator.   The catch is: every 'unpowered' room you discover has a chance to spawn monsters every time you open a door. Every monster will then proceed to attack your crystal, reducing your 'dust'(A currency, required to power rooms which also serves as crystal's HP) until it's depleted. Also as soon as you take your crystal off its place - there is no turning back, monsters will spawn in every room and begin attacking you until you reach the elevator.  Your progress is not limited to just leveling up your heroes and giving them equipment. Tons of random events occur in a dungeon, which offer you to hire new heroes in your party, trade your resources for a powerful equipment and research over a dozen turrets, modules and other ways to defend your crystal as you proceed through the floors.  The game features a great amount of unlockable content. Characters, starting setups and an artwork gallery. Its replayability is totally on the highest of levels. Especially considering that every piece of equipment found inside a dungeon is generated with random stats.  Game also features a multiplayer mode, which adds more tactical depth since you can divide the roles and do whatever you wanted to but lacked a partner controlling a character in a singleplayer mode.  TL;DR : A great party dungeon crawler with a randomly generated floor structures, deep tower defense features, unique and interesting pre-made heroes and a great replayability value because of the unlocks. Also music. The soundtrack is very good.",

'If I keep this up, I can escort the crystal to the end of the floor easily.'  ~EXIT FOUND~  'I should probably move the crystal.' ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE  ♥♥♥♥.  Roguelike that appears to be a mixture of FTL's pause based gameplay, tower defence and a few other interesting elements. Pseudo real-time, in the sense that combat happens dynamically but resource generation is gated to 'turns'. A 'turn' is triggered when you open a new door, and once you open all doors on a floor (unless there is some other way to generate resources outside of discovery and 'turns'), you're at an impasse until the next floor.  The visuals appear retro in their pixelated designs, but are exquisitely intricate. Shadows move dynamically, lasers illuminate the environment, lights glow eerily in darkened rooms; it's really something to lay eyes upon and it looks spectacular in motion.  I'm yet to complete this game on what I think is the highest difficulty (labelling everything with variants of easy doesn't distill much confidence), but I've had a blast doing it.  It doesn't take much time for a single playthrough (even less so if you're terrible at it like I am), and it is cruel but rarely unfair. Be ready for the monster house that you unleash with the removal of your crystal.  Only real gripes with the game are minor ones: the fonts used in the menus does not align with the visual aspect (modern vs retro), and anyone that has played Endless Space is going to notice the FIDS icons used to denote the currencies for research, levelling up and construction in all of their crisp glory which clashes wtih the game's general aesthetic. I get that the Endless (currently at a trilogy: Space/Dungeon/Legend) games are linked (which I think is cool), but it's still a little jarring given the overall style of DotE.  All-in-all, I love what I've played of this game thus far (Steam game time is not 100% accurate as I have spent some time playing this on my daily train rides to work), and look forward to continuing to fail miserably in the future. Well worth it for the cost.",

            "review_text": "This game is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing, best money you will spend on a game. 10/10 replay value, 10/10 satisfaction after winning.  Dungeon of the Endless has not only great 32bit art but also amazing sounds and gameplay in general. This game has everyting a gamer would love, little bit of rpg, big chunk of tower defense, and big scoop of strategizing.   There are just so many things you have to keep in mind, so many trials and erros, and the fact that it's all randomized each time you play is just pure genius. Yes, indeed you also need some luck due to the fact that it's randomized, but that's what makes this game THE game.   Even though it's so frustrating at times it just makes it that much more satisfying to finally beat it, it is so challenging that you don't want to try the 'too easy' option, it brings out the inner gamer competitiveness in you (seriously don't puss out and do 'too easy').   At first you may go 'WTF this ain't no RPG man you cant even control the damn heroes the way you want!', but as you play the game you will realize how ♥♥♥♥ing wrong you were. This game IS RPG, maybe not the RPG you are normally used to, which is what makes this game so unique! Just that hint of RPG, the roles of heroes that you need in a group, the dream team, it just makes my inner nerd so HARD.  You seriously have to put your soul in this game, you have to figure out every little details to fully enjoy it. It is so simple that it's complicated, this game will test your limits and to break those limits you will have to use everything you learn and know about the game to beat it every.single.time.  In all, to me the best part of the game honestly was the ending scene, it has no fancy cinematic or anything at all, just one mother♥♥♥♥ing epic cutscene, it makes everyting just so worthwhile, too epic, so majestic. It just makes you want to beat it again with different heroes.   DO NOT get this game if you are impatient or if you do not have good game senses, I guarantee that you will probably stop playing after couple hours.  It is a VERY hard game so I recommend you play with at least 1 or 2 really good friends that you can communicate with at all times, or else you are going to have a bad time. COMMUNICATION IS KEY (you can trade all resources with other players at any time, don't hoard resources if you don't need them, ask for resources!) -You can trade resources by clicking your resources at top left of the screen-  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ SOME TIPS: Leaving a hero in a unpowered room makes it so that it's 'slightly lit', which makes it so that mobs don't spawn from that room. THIS IS KEY TO WINNING, so make sure to place them strategically after each waves and such before opening any more doors.   Never get the same module updates as other players, pick a role and stick with it, DO NOT get greddy.  It is also important that you play this game like any other RPGs, pick a tank, dps, support.   I recommend having 1 range dps, 1 tanker, 1 runner (fastest movement speed for crystal run at the end of floor), and a operator with high wits for that extra resource boost when operating major modules.  I also recommend getting Tear Gas and Smoking Gun for offense because with those 2 combos you will melt the ♥♥♥♥ out of mobs with ease. (Tear Gas is ♥♥♥♥ing dope, that defense reduce so sexy as hell)  Every other minor modules are not really necessary to beat the game, other than Autodoc Shards for heals really late game. What I did was have a room full of Autodoc Shards as a back up 'healing room' for emergencies or for fighting bosses that appears late games.  Prisoner Prods are also good for cheap defense for early games and such, upgrade them ASAP for easy wins early floors.  Although not necessary to win the game it will be a lifesaver to have the Emergency Generator major module for late games when dusts are rare as ♥♥♥♥.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ There are still some annoying glitches such as not being able to buy or sell ♥♥♥♥ to the merchant, which can be a HUGE pain in the ♥♥♥ esp late game, but bear with it and just play the game through.  This however is easily fixable during a solo play by saving and quitting then just continuing the game again (for some reason this fixes everyting, yay :D). Still a huge pain in the ♥♥♥ since you obviously can not do this during a multiplayer game.  With this in mind you will have the best chance to beat the game, it will still take incredible amount of replays to get it just right, so be patient and hope for the best.  BUT SERIOUSLY BUY THE GAME AND PLAY IT, ENJOY!  P.S. no you can not trade items with other players sooo don't be hogging all the chest you come by.",

            "review_text": "Imagine FTL crash-landed into Dungeons of Dredmor, and you could begin to explain Dungeon of the Enedless. Sort of.   Amplitude has merged serveral genres into one in DotE (roguelike, 4x, squad tactics), and with stunning results. Don't let the mix of genres intimidate you. I'd never touched the 4x genre before, and found the basics of the game easy to learn.  You begin by choosing two party members as your escape pod crash-lands in a hostile environment. The goal is to get your crystal (i.e., what powers all of your rooms and strucures) to the exit of each floor. As you navigate your way through 12 levels, you will find a variety of equipment, teammates, and problems to solve (namely: how to keep your crystal from being detroyed).  Each door opened constitutes a new turn, and that's when resources (industry, science, food and dust) are gained. Industry allows you to buiild, science can be spent on researching new modules, food levels/heals/recruits heroes, and dust powers rooms. Because rooms are powered by dust, you'll want to watch how much you have, as unpowered rooms will spawn enemies on most turns. Enemies will navigate toward the crystal in the most direct path available, so plan your defense as your explore.  Choose your party members wisely, use their strengths to your advantage, and be careful about opening that next door. Some heroes are faster, tougher or more potent in combat than others. Some excel at a single role, while a few are flexible enough to do whatever the case calls far. Knowing when to man a defense and when to retreat will be important. A handful of heroes have the 'operate' skill, allowing you to buff whatever major module they're manning. Make sure to pause often in combat -- it can save the life of your teammates when enemy waves become overwhelming. Death is permanent, so don't be stingy.  Your heroes aren't alone in this, however, as you can build and research new structures (Major and Minor modules, both offensive and defensive) to help you succeed. Major modules are mostly for gaining resources, while minor vary from standard turrets, defensive buffs/debuffs or even healing teammates on enemy kills. Keep an eye out for how to gather as many resources as possible, as they will prove vital to success. You can't take your built modules with you, but you will retain any resources accrued.  As far as sound and visual design go, DotE is a pleasant and consistent 16-bit palate. The visuals are highly stylized and consistent, and the soundtrack will keep reminding you of tunes that could just as easily be from SNES titles or FTL. Thanks to unlocking new characters, difficulties and escape pods, the game is chock full of replayability. Online co-op should further bolster the game's lifetime, but I haven't had any experience with it to comment on.  It's not as frustrating (read: unfair) as FTL, but still challenging enough to leave you feeling satisfied... even on the 'Too Easy' difficulty setting. Highly recommended.",

I don't have the best computer so it's a gamble to purchase games, and living in a small town without any place to work has made game purchasing hard as of late. So when I was working I made sure to pick this one up to have support the authors. That's something all of you should do, if you pirate a game and enjoy it, then buy it!   Anyway, this game is best described as a tower defence roguelike dungeon crawler. I'm not always in the tower defense mood, but when I am I am glad to have this game to go to. My only grief is the same grief I have with most tower defense games. Once you figure out a working strategy the challenge vanishes. Thankfully there are other game modes to play with, some of which don't allow me to do my winning strategy. (Boy did my heart sink once I figured out the strategy to just breeze through the game though)   I recently got caught up in a nearly 16 hour straight gaming session with this one (which is when I figured out my strategy) and got a little burnt out and probably wont be playing it again for some time. I'm still glad to have it in my library and if any further updates come alone to freshen things up a bit more I'll certainly hop back into it.  Oh, and one more grief is the online play. It's best to play with friends that you know already and to communicate using skype or something. I've never finished to the end on any online play, someone almost always drops out after the second floor, if not the host dropping everyone immediately after game start. I once made it to the eighth floor with someone online. But what started with 4 became 2 after the third floor. If there was a way for the resources to be divided up among the players or something different than the current system it would help a lot. I've had games that quit immediately because someone used up a resource right away or built a module that made the host upset. All and all, unless you have friends like I said before, just don't worry about the multiplayer.   In all if anything I wrote sounds appealing then go for it! Especially if it's on sale. I really need to stop getting inspired to write a review right before I go to bed. I've been nodding off while writing this and forgetting what I just wrote. So sorry if this is a bit jumbled. It was written by a very sleepy man who for some reason, decided now is the time to share with the world that I like this game! Keep up the good work game making team guys who made this!",

            "review_text": "Im major roguelike fan. My favourites include Risk of Rain, Faster Than Light and One Way Heroics, so i have some experience on the genre. But yeah, let's get to the point:  In Dungeon of The Endless your goal is to escape the Underground Lab whilst defending yourself with heroes and different turrets. You start humbly, but as you make your way closer to the entrance, you'll recruit new heroes, and unlock new turrets to keep them alive. But as you grow stronger, enemies grow outright brutal, in strength, variety and sheer numbers...  The game is a masterpiece. I'd recommend it to anyone who's into roguelikes, towerdefence or dungeon crawling. If you're into 2 or more of those categories, you should have alredy bought the game just to see what you're missing. Here are the pros and cons of the game: + Art style is unique and pretty. + Music is great. + Gameplay is innovative and fresh. + Glitches are extremely rare. + The story is interesting (if you care to search for it), as are the interactions between playable characters (heroes). + Amazing replayability. + Micromanagement. Doing one thing over and over might get you trough couple floors, but after that the enemies will slaughter you. So it's important to keep in mind what kind of enemies the floor in question hosts, and what turrets work on them.  - Sadly, Multiplayer still isn't up to par. Since 1 game can last multiple hours, it's inexcusable to have people randomly disconnecting without chance of reconnect. Also, the lack of ingame trading makes things quite tedious. - Game could use more heroes. When team consists of 4 people, 16 regular heroes and 3 Dlc/promotion are just not enough. - Some of them would need some balancing work. (Im looking at you Max and Josh) - The luck factor. As with all roguelikes, sometimes the game just kills you without giving you even slightest chance. This becomes apparent, when you're on the last level, and game refuses to give you any Dust (resource required to power your defences), and then steamrolling you with first big enemy wave.  Long story short, I still love the game. 130+ hours played, and I have yet to clear the Sanitary pod (hard mode). Update, Sanitary Pod cleared with around 140 hours.  Rating: 9/10 If multiplayer ever gets proper patches, I'll upgrade that to 9,5/10.",

There are plenty of reviews that have done that, so I'm going to keep it short and let you know just what kind of game this is.   Game elements that Dungeon of the Endless does well:  Roguelike (with permadeath)  Tower Defense (a variety of towers that you'll need to complete each floor)  RTS (with pause, research and resource management)  RPG (character leveling and equipment)  Squad-based Combat   Each of those elements exist here, and they're all handled perfectly. The closest thing this game has to a failing is the weakish story, and limited dialogue. Some of the dialogue is a little poorly written, as well. The characters are crazy cool, though. And there are lots of them to unlock. Don't buy it for the story. Buy it because it's a jack-of-all-trades video game that masters every job it sets out to accomplish.  Warning: This game is hard.

The game starts with 'Easy' and 'Too Easy' difficulties. 'Easy' is properly 'Normal,' or perhaps 'Hard.' The strategic elements are really intriguing, and I like having characters that can equip items &amp; level up. The tower-defense-lite elements, mixed in, are neat too. The soundtrack is nice, if a bit bland.  But (regrettably, like many games lately) the RNG elements are poorly balanced. In this case, the imbalance centers mostly around the 'Dust' aspect. 'Dust' is some kind of energy source, and you use it to power-up the rooms that you explore. You can voluntarily power and unpower rooms, to manage your 'Dust,' which is strategic. However, you accumulate dust very randomly, mostly by opening doors to new rooms. Sometimes, +10 dust. Other times, nada. Powering rooms via dust (or rather, leaving them unpowered) is a double-whammy: your defenses won't operate in unpowered rooms, and enemies randomly spawn in unpowered rooms, always seeking to attack your 'crystal.' You don't need to power the crystal room, but yoiu can't place any 'towers' in it, either. Monsters attacking your crystal will then cause you to lose dust, usually rather quickly.   It really boils down to the fact that a couple less-than-fortunate dust-related events, and the run will quickly spiral out of control and becomes irrecoverable. Unlike some of the better rogue-like games (e.g., Binding of Isaac, or Rogue Legacy), death provides you with nothing to show for it. At the end of a long run, there's very little impetus to start over.  ",

I ditched it fast.  But I've just installed the release version, and now I'm suitably impressed.  The game operates on the idea that each door you open represents a 'turn', a turn where heroes are healed, resources gained, technology researched, and cooldowns ticked. During that turn you might fight monsters, open chests, find merchants, stuff like that. Your main ways of influencing the game aren't to physically control the characters while they fight, it's to position the characters in rooms such that they do the most damage. Or pop their abilities at the right time, swap their equipment, or change which rooms have electricity going to them (and consequently, have light/defenses/resource collection).  Unlike normal RPGs - there is no gold and no experience points. There are four resources; food, industry, science, and dust. You level your heroes up with food, build turrets/resource gatherers with industry, research new technology with science, and power rooms with dust. Each of these resources is crucial in it's own way, and the management of those resources defines if you win or not.  Because there's no gold or XP, this game really feels different. The incentive structure is completely unique; you don't want to fight enemies, you need to open doors. But opening doors might get too dangerous once you get near the end of a floor, and it might be better to skip it and run. You might spend food on levelling up, or healing your people. There's no global currency, merchants accept a random resource as currency in trade, and each resource gets used every floor, so you never hoard anything.  The coop is fun, but it also really needs fixes. You cannot save coop games, so you have to be prepared to stick it out for the 2+ hours required to play a round - or abandon the game. Players cannot share items between them (but they can share resources), they need to sell items at the merchant and have the other player buy it - at a loss. Random crashes and freezes during level load completely take down a lobby (which means you need to start an entirely new game, see the 'no saving' above). And there is no character sharing. So if your friend's only character dies, and you're left alone with two characters, you can't share it with him. You might as well start over, or wait until a new character appears in a floor. Characters that aren't controlled by you don't get unlocked in your game. So if your friend took a character you haven't unlocked, and plays the game until that character is unlocked for him, you won't get the unlock. *You* have to play the character (probably in singleplayer) to unlock them.   Overall the bugs aren't too noticeable. And it's a neat game that took all the usual formulaic elements of a game and twisted them slightly to make a totally new sort of game, without getting too abstract or weird about it.",

When it comes down to what you like about them, the challenge or the exploration, I think I like this game better as the challenge doesn't rely entirely on totallyrandom generation. Imagine if you could improve your ship in FTL without needingit all to come from shops or random encounters, but also gave you the options of directly influencing the parts of your ship with scrap, reinforcing the hull or weapons by themselves. That's what the heroesin this game fillthe gap on. Mixing it with tower defense makes this game engaging as you try tokeep heroes inbetween monsters and your crystal ala Dungeon Defenders, and executes it with the power sent to each grid. Managing these, your heroes and your defense network makes the game engaging.  I would like to see more ships added. I enjoythe fact you can have certain gains and deficits granted by each pod, but if the developer doesn't make some whacky options available, or powerful ones, then the gimmick is short lived. I may be the only one who wants to see strange and fantastic options anymore, though. The excitement of seeing the doors open (as this is a door opening simulator, not a monster defense game as one would assume) is sadly reduced once you've run the gambit of monsters. I would like to see more happen.  Gameplay: 9/10 Polished, well executed, and lacking in only the slightest of refinements. The stats lack descriptions and the tutorial hucks you in after a basic example.  Story: 7/10 Must unlockthe characters and have them gab at one another for the story, but then again, that isn't what you came to do in this game, was it?  Graphics: 8/10 Very pretty in game environments, monsters are varied but fit thesame subcategories, heroes continue to surpirse me in some ways. But the lit rooms sometimes offer little more than the dark ones did other than lack of gnawing death.  Sound 9/10: As with games of this nature, sound effects are re-used oftenbut it doesn't grate the ears. Music is appropriate, well done, and generally pleasing.

This game could easily be played for hours with you and your 3 friends all shuffling around the rooms trying to not Screw up. In this game Teamwork and Communication is crutial and makes the game Entertaining. While you can play Single Player, I highly suggest buying this for you and a friend to play, it is about 10 times more fun with other people. You have your 4 Resources, Food, Production (Which allows Building Defenses and Production Buildings), Science, And Dust. Food Allows you to level up, buy items from vendors, heal in the middle of a turn, and even to hire new characters. Science allows you to Research New Buildings and Building Upgrades, and also to occasionally buy items from vendors although it's more likely to see a vendor buying either Production or Food, And Dust allows you to power rooms for Defenses, Production, and (Most importantly) to stop Monsters from Spawning in a room. The Monsters are pretty Tough to say the least and can make you almost smash your keyboard into the wall which makes resource and power management more crucial to your sanity. To get through a Level you must find the exit and get both your Main Gem and your characters into the Exit Room. This game is Worth the Money and the developers are amazing for this game. If you have the money pick up a few copies for you and your friends",

            "review_text": "I've only put a few hours into this game so far, but it's been great testing the waters and learning how it works. All of the seemingly disparate genre elements are tightly and smartly woven together in a package that seems greater than the sum of its parts. Dense with information at first, you're given a lot of room to learn and grow. There are some random elements at work, but as you learn how the game works you will eventually be able to handle what the game throws at you. Difficult for sure, but not unfair or unmanageable.  In addition to the rock-solid gameplay, Dungeon of the Endless is both an aural and visual delight. The soundtrack is excellently paced and fits in with the game incredibly well, and I'm grateful that the soundtrack is included in the game's files already in MP3 format. Graphics are nicely stylized pixel art with some decent lighting and particle effects layered on top. It's always clear to see what's going on and who is who when things get hectic.  Dungeon of the Endless also has a nicely balanced sense of dread about what's through every next door, but also a good amount of humor to break up the tension. Not to mention the growing sense of satisfaction and glee as you make it further and further, overcoming steadily greater obstacles. Besides the initial, steep difficulty curve of learning how the game works, each dungeon has a steady - but fair - climb in difficulty as you progress. It's also highly replayable, further adding to the game's value.  I'm amazed that the developer even tried to make an RPG/Tower Defense/Roguelike/Strategy hybrid, and even moreso that they actually pulled it off so well. I already know that this is a game I'll be coming back to for years.",

Tried again  Third game. It all starts to make sense and I realised it's actually really great.  Never played anything quite like it. An intriguing mix of tower defense, strategy, resource management and exploration that has a massive 'just one more turn' factor. Whilst the premise is quite simple once you understand it, each turn really makes you think about the strategy you're going to employ, and it's very satisfying fending off a huge wave of enemies with a good combo of defenses and abilities when your plan works out.   Just got my first victory and I'm very much looking forward to starting the next game. Definitely recommended if you enjoy something a little different.",

My friends and I were on the last floor of the first ship (Floor 13) and we were about to beat it until all of a sudden everything paused and no one was moving but us. None of the enemies were moving, they werent dying but just standing still, until a few seconds later,I tried saving and exiting the game so I can restart it but it wouldnt let me either, then I died for some reason and then the enemies were moving finally but the two of my friends were still alive so I told them to quickly get the crystal and go to the exit. After getting the crystal and arriving almost at the exit they go into the exit, both of them of course (again to remind you I died) and they tried placing the crystal and it wouldn't do it and thus they died because of this stupid bug. Also this one time my same friends plus one more to make four people were playing and we were on floor 11 and once we moved onto floor 12, we spawned in..... but only three and my friend couldnt join back and we tried saving the game and restarting the save file but they were just dead suddenly. This game is great overall, in fact I love it but there some things that need to be worked out and troubleshooted, We hope in the future that this game is well formatted and ready to play without any problems so my friends and I could enjoy the gameplay for hours and hours again. Great game though, please fix bugs   Thank You,  Big fan, TwistedLyric",

            "review_text": "  Usually, I start my reviews with a small paragraph to explain what type of game I’m reviewing. ‘Dungeon of the Endless’, or DotE for short, is an exception to that rule because while it is a strategy, tower defence and roguelike, and it’s rightfully tagged as such, it’s far more than that. It combines the above elements and the outcome simply cannot be defined by any of them. After quite some time into the game, I consider DotE mainly as a survival game, with features from the genres mentioned above. The reason is simple, your objective when you start a new game is to manage to get your group through various floors and survive until you reach the surface.  The story is simple enough, the ship you are in, a prison hulk, is sent to colonise an unexplored planet, Auriga Prime. The only known facts about the planet are, that it was used by an ancient space-traveling race, called the Endless, and that there are resources and habitable environment. While the prison hulk arrived, long forgotten defence systems activated and destroyed it. The ships emergency protocols went into effect and shot all escape pods to the planet. The trick was most ship modules could also function as escape pods as well.  When you begin a new game you choose the pod you’ll start the game in, the heroes you’ll start your accent and between 2 difficulty settings, too easy and easy. The pod determines the accents bonuses or handicaps, and given that the prison ship modules were used as escape pods, there is a good variety in them. You choose, depending on the pod, 1-4 heroes from the available list and as far as the 2 difficulties, they are certainly not what they are named, however, they are named in relation to the other so you’ll know which one is harder, prepare to fail a lot as the game is hard! After you are done with you selection and start your attempt to accent, you’ll find the selected heroes in the pod with the pod's power source and the door out of the pod. Your goal is to have at least one hero reach the exit while protecting your power source. Now, before we open that door there are some stuff I must explain first. You have 4 types of resources, industry, science, food and dust. By default, you gain some of the first 3 every time you open a door, while dust, being special, can only be found, looted or created under special conditions. Upon opening the door, a turn is complete and the new room is revealed. The new room can vary in many ways, from if it’ll have enemies, a vendor, an event or even nothing at all. Each room will have some buildable slots in it, usually a big one and few small ones. The big one is used for primary modules, most common are resource production ones that increase your gains upon completing a turn, while the smaller ones can be used for a wide variety of either defensive or utility modules, this is the ‘tower defence’ part of DotE. In order to build anything you’ll need industry points, to research new modules you’ll need science points and finally, food is used to hire, level up or heal your heroes. Upon securing the new room, you’ll be able to spend dust in order to power it, once powered you can build modules in it, however, some rules still apply, to power up a room, it must be adjacent to your power source or a room already powered by your power source. The strategy or tactical part of the game comes now, as you make decisions on whether you’ll power a room and what you’ll build in it, or, generally, how you’ll spend your hard earned limited resources. By choosing to leave a room unpowered it becomes a potential spawn for monsters whenever you start a new turn. A great feature of the game is that there is a map screen, where you can see the entire floor and give numerous orders to your heroes, however, the only real negative to this, is that you cannot open a door from this screen. The heroes follow some RPG rules, by having stats to show their effectiveness in each area and have item slots to equip items that can be found in the dungeon. Additionally, each hero has active and passive skills, with new ones being unlocked and existing ones upgraded upon levelling him up. Heroes also have special interactions for you to find about, either hatred or friendship, you’ll have to try many different group combinations and see how they interact with each other after each floor. The monsters, on the other hand, are quite variable and each feels unique towards its role, from swarming to buff or debuff ones, they even have different targeting priorities that you’ll have to find out and act accordingly. Each is easily recognisable from its model and you can pause any time to see what you’re up against.  The visuals speak for themselves, while pixelated, each aspect is quite clear to see as heroes, enemies, animations and even effects have their unique model. The music while not that special by itself, does amplify the gameplay mostly because it has a bit-y theme and changes depending on whether you are in combat or not. As a side note, every version of the game has the soundtrack available in the game folder!  Overall the game is a roguelike, meaning each run will be unique as each floor is procedurally generated. There are few roguelite elements that consist of unlocking new heroes to choose from and starting pods. On the negatives is that the tutorial is poor on purpose, it leaves many game features for you to find out, either by succeeding or not. It offers great replayability and time travel, as you’ll wonder how fast the time passes while you play DotE and opening ‘just one more’ door! While it’s really unique towards what it offers it’s really hard to give an objective score as there are little points that DotE can be related to other games, that being said for me it’s easily a 9/10 as it’s worth every cent/penny you spent on it, it will keep you busy for a long time and with each run being unique it has something to offer! I believe that if you like titles like ‘Faster than Light’ you will find great enjoyment here too!  ----------------------------------- Introducing Gamephasis   www.gamephasis.com  is a new gaming website featuring a talented team of game writers from around the world.

            "review_text": "I recommend this game for Various reasons i try to explain below, though it may not be enough information for the average gamer.  A solid Tower Defense/Turn-based strategy mixed with sci-fi and hack-n-slash. Whether solo playing or online multiplayer, 'DotE' will give most players a hard time; either by high blood pressure, rage, and/or suicidal thoughts. Theres a few easter eggs you'll catch here and there, and i'll not add any spoilers, but you'll get a chuckle or two from finding them out. Replayability is high (for me atleast). And we cant forget about that futuristic and highly advanced melodic elevator music  I've noticed a few bugs here and there, like heroes getting stuck in the animation for opening doors, which is gamebreaking more or less(if you can risk a hero taking one for the team). Or your tactical map not working, and you have to manually click and drag on the map just to see whats going on. On another note, the servers arent exactly...perfect with connectivity. This game also has its fair share of 'THOSE GUYS' who immediately kick you from lobbies without giving you an excuse or even saying hello. It happens ALOT, and its a bit rude and repetitive.   On the plus side, by having Endless Legend and/or Endless space, you will start seeing a few monsters and races from the other Endless titles. Brings back some decent memories, especially the broken lord Hero, and her impressive defense.Theres different Passive and Active abilites for heroes ranging from typical damage and defense boosts, highly resourceful aggro's, and turret/module upgrades. I believe this is the first game i've witnessed take advantage of hero's gaining or losing power due to thier personality and teammates within the same room as them on the dungeon floor.   Both Endless Legend and Endless Space (great games by the way, leaning more toward Endless legend) have modding options and tools except for this installment in the Endless series. Hopefully that will change in a few months time BECUASE i'd like to see more heroes, abilities, and possibly monsters and multiple factions from the other games. By getting Emporer and Crystal packs from the other titles, it unlocks characters, ships, and artwork, music etc for DotE.  It doesnt take a genious to figure out the uses of Food, Industry, and Science (no excuses for those of you who played the previous titles), although theres a slight exception for Dust as the tutorial deosnt exactly teach you how NOT to get your ♥♥♥ kicked the first few playthroughs.  Any way, im out. So good luck and add me if you need a companion or opponent in any of the Endless games. I also recommend Endless Legend for those of you who who like hexagonal turn based strategies like 'Michael Meyers' Beyond Earth.",

Gameplay is a combo of dungeon crawl and tower defense, and is accomplished very successfully. The humor is a nice touch, and is funny without being too cheesy.

And thats the fun part of this game. Get your group, explore the dungeon and try to get to the end. I suggest to reinforce your path to the elevator with turrets of all sorts, as things will get really bad really fast once you remove the cristal from the previous spot. This game has a good price-replayability ratio and it's a wise purchase, if you are a fan of roguelike games or tower defense ones. Fun to play it in coop with your friends too.

It's pretty remarkable how this dev studio can perform exceptionally across multiple genres and it is my strong belief they are the darlings of the least known devs.   This game plays sort of like a dungeon crawler/resource management sim with risk/reward style play with added RPG elements in character leveling and inventory. It actually sort of defies genre labelling moreso than the other two Endless games, and while it's hard to exactly pin down, this is mostly a dungeon crawler (with the perma death and exploration and risk/danger of the unknown that that genre entails).   The multiplayer is also solid aswell, twisting on the singleplayer composition to include other players in a way that feels both intuitive and natural. I have to say I prefer the multiplayer element of this game, but that's not to diminish the singleplayer side.

(Binding of Issac:Rebirth/Afterbirth, I'm looking at you buddy). This beautiful game also has great characters, from their design, to their bios, and even to the small blurbs of diologue they make, my favorite being Skroig saying “Shall we dance, Mademoiselle Christelle?' which brings me to the most interesting part of this game: The Crystal. Yes you will lose if all your heroes die, but you also will lose if you run out of dust when enemies attack your crystal. The blend of roguelike and tower defense is prestine and I reccomend this game not only to people who are fans of one or both of the genres, but also to people unexposed to amazing roguelikes or amazing tower defenses.",

Have enemies that attack and destroy them, wasting your resources. Want, or have to put the big modules in places outside of a dead end? There's enemies that will attack them, too, and are strong enough to blow them up in a couple hits, wasting a lot of your resources. You can't repair that damage unless you have someone with the repair skill, and it seems pretty often you'll have a party that doesn't contain one of those people.   If you have a good enough set-up to get past those, the game will also start throwing in monsters that will smash open doors, which can spawn more waves, quickly forming a no-win scenario. If that monster is going for a door in an unpowered room (something that becomes more and more common as you progress, since you receive less and less Dust every floor), you'll need to send a hero in to kill it. Don't have one that's capable of doing that without getting killed by monsters that target them? Tough.   Better hope you get one if you get up to the later floors, because another enemy appears that only spawns in unpowered rooms. It's stationary, but is quite strong, and will make enemies on that floor stronger, and since it's an enemy you need to get rid of it to actually get the after-combat regen. It's easy to kill when it first appears, but since it does along with other monsters in a wave, you again need someone who can run in and kill it quickly without dying themselves.  You have your pick of two heroes at the start of the game, but it feels like no matter what you'll have some hole the game can exploit, which you need to rely on what heroes you'll encounter to fill. Since some are just straight up better than others, due to Repair and Operate being so important, it can be quite annoying to run into a combat hero when you need another person with those skills, or someone squishy when you needed someone else to work a choke point. Lots of Tower Defense games have dangerous enemies, but I found the ones in this game brought it down a lot.",

You will lose and you will lose a lot but it will almost always be because of your own mistakes and not just RNG silliness. No two play-throughs will be the same thus making for a lot of replayability. As such the game, for me, was and still is great value.  I can only recommend you give it a go, especially since the other games from the same company are pretty unique and deserve attention in their own right.

Don't get me wrong, it's fun, have put a few hours into it myself, but the amount of time one run takes is a little exhausting. Each room is 10-45 mins, with 13 rooms, each longer and harder, riding an exponential curve type-of-deal. I poured ~5 hours with a friend and have only gotten to level 11 (unfinished though).  Thankfully you can save and continue, though. And multiplayer is essentially bug free. (You can even save and continue your multiplayer games!)  It may be that I came into it expecting a 'sit down and finish in one sitting' type of game (there is no save button in the interim/elevator screen, but only actually in the level can you 'esc') and got a 'sit down and REALLY WANT TO CONTINUE but you can't because it's already been 3 hours and you're only 75% done'.  Also rage inducing when you run out of resources / never have enough light / the music is a little depressing / it's dark / the item rolls kept giving you assault rifles when you need a sword / did I mention the atmosphere was a little depressing?  Otherwise, beyond the complaining, the ship models are FANTASTIC, the textures are excellent, the animations are good, there are shadows, yes *REAL SHADOWS* in a pixel game. Sound design is good too, but I mean, you're stuck underground so it's gotta be a little dark and moody.

Furthermore, you don't really control anything that's going on; you just turn things on and off and hope your characters don't die where you've stationed them. Your control over the fight? You can clumsily move your mouse to the green + next to their portrait to heal them if you have Food available.  By the way, the only thing making this game any different from a tower defense? ENEMIES CAN SPAWN ANYWHERE ON THE PATH TO YOUR TOWER, in any room you haven't turned the ♥♥♥♥ing lights on in. What kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t is that? Did I mention that the only resource to heal your characters is acquired by opening doors, thus creating MORE ROOMS you can't possibly keep lit, thus allowing more monsters to spawn than you can possibly manage?  I have absolutely no interest in the outcome when I play this game, because due to the absolutely idiotic design choices made in this game, I'm not actually playing anything. The game pretty much does its own thing and tells me to go ♥♥♥♥ myself.  Just about everything about this game is terrible; the horrendously awkward and self-defeating gameplay, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ faux-retro graphics that make it impossible to tell what's going on, and was there even music?? At all??  Oh and lest I forget: absolutely no game should ever require the middle mouse button or scrollwheel in gameplay. That's all there is to that.

            "review_text": "This game tries so hard to be too many different things. It starts off seeming like it's pretty great, but then the more times you play it, the more you realize in its efforts to be a little of everything, it's not good at any one thing particularly. There's too much resource management for this to feel like a true rogue-like, so you're constantly monitoring the amount of resources you have and lots of different modules. The tower defense elements are not really that well implemented, you must rely on the heroes to do much of the work - but if you try and stick heavy with leveling and outfitting your heroes, you'll get creamed later on in the game when the waves get much larger and more vicious. Even well equipped heroes with many bonuses have a hard time against some of these creatures, but unlike most tower defense where you can give yourself a lot of time to chip away at them, you really can't.  In this game, you use dust to power rooms, without power the rooms can spawn creatures and you can't put any modules in that room. You can't light all the rooms, so at best you can just make it so they only approach from a few vectors. This chokepoint idea seems like it would be fun in theory, but in practice it works poorly. You have to place modules down to increase the resource gains per door opened (turn) but you'll almost have to place these along the route to the exit for each floor for them to be protected and useful. So you have to place your valuable modules in the direct path of where bad guys will be walking along, and they'll smash the modules quickly. To make matters worse, you must research every module besides a few very basic ones. This research does not carry over between matches, so you restart this process each new game. Each module takes 3 turns to research, but if you start research on one and there are only 2 doors left on the floor - you're SOL for the research you just spent on that. Again, in a game that was more balanced this would be an acceptable risk, but losing out on things like this will screw you over so fast you might as well just give up.  So unfortunately, this game causes lots of frustration after you spend quite a long time on a run and then lose it because the game decides to throw too many creatures for you to handle. Whereas losing a run of Binding of Isaac or FTL is irritating but gives you another chance to learn without feeling to punishing, Dungeon of the Endless takes a lot of your time to get through a run and messing up after spending so much time on a match feels awful and sharply decreases your desire to make multiple runs. This game is much more of a sit down and make a run, and if you lose, just quit and come back another day (To compare, I found myself playing many runs of FTL and Binding of Isaac as both felt way more receptive to quick runs and not these long drawn out things). To make note - the creatures don't always spawn every turn, sometimes none spawn. Even with well prepared defenses, heroes set up in good positions, you will still get absolutely smashed. You'll be pausing to heal your hero, unpausing, then a second or two later pausing again to heal, until you either have nearly no food left or they just die.   While all rogue-like games have that element of RNG and unpredictablility, Dungeon of the Endless piles that on top of a mediocre tower defense and dungeon crawler. FTL is frustrating for those same reasons (RNG), but you can tactically plan much better than you can in Dungeon of the Endless. This game is just too lackluster in too many areas to be worth it. Yes, the art style looks pretty nice and the music is pretty good - I wanted so much to like this game, but I just can't. The game has too much going on for its own good and brings down the overall experience completely.",

The spritework is absolutely gorgeous, the ambience is great, and there's an impressive merger of mechanics from several genres into one cohesive package. You advance through rooms and collect resources in a vaguely turn-based fashion while setting up emplacements and exploring to find the exit to transport your all-important crystal to. Once the enemies show up, however, you have to deal with them in full realtime, by either building miniature defense turrets or pointing your heroes to the room with the enemies and watching as they hit each other until someone falls over.  This is where things start to fall apart for me; I've never been a fan of traditional RTS's, and if I had to put a predominant genre on how this game functions, it feels like a bloated, over-difficult, lackluster objective-based RTS without any clear engagement hierarchy between units. You have to deal with extremely tight resource management to work on upgrades for installations, research, and hero levels -- the latter is achieved by amassing food resources to dump on a hero as a lump sum for a new level, rather than earned by dispatching enemies or exploring; which again, reduces the sense of involvement. The only direct agency you have in a fight is to change rooms, point to a hero and tell them to retreat, or spend food resources on healing.  Then you have the extra sadistic layer of how equipment functions; when found, it is deposited in your inventory where it can be stored. Once actively equipped, those items will be lost after the current floor is finished. And naturally, as per the advertised roguelike-like elements, the game is balls-hard, death is permanent, and the only saves are interrupt saves.  It seems like an incredibly well made game, but there is a cognitive dissonance between all the mechanics that only evokes overwhelming stress in me. I can't point to a single facet of the game that I actually find *fun*.  The tutorial also could have stood to explain a few more things before dumping you into the thick of it.",

It's also really hard, but so far I am enjoying that as well. The developers deserve a lot of credit for forging a unique gameplay experience from the combination of different genres. This kind of creativity and experimentation should be praised and encouraged, especially when the resulting game actually plays so well!  There were two things I found a little disappointing that might not be super-obvious to those considering a purchase:   First, you don't directly control your heroes in combat; you simply tell them which room to enter and they fight whatever is in there. I understand why this ability would make an already complex game even more complex, but sometimes I still wish I could pick a hero and go arcade-style on some aliens.   Secondly, and I could be wrong about this, but it appears that most of the visual differences between rooms are purely cosmetic. There's a lot of intriguing scenery that appears to have no in-game effects. The different spatial arrangements of module sockets in a room also don't seem to affect combat in a big way, although the number of sockets is important. I wish the different room shapes, contents, and specific locations of sockets made more of a tactical difference in combat.   I mention these only because the game's originality can make it especially hard to tell what features it might or might not have, and I think people will have more fun with the game if they're not expecting something else. Overall, I definitely recommend the game! In a world of copycats, this one really is different.",

Sometimes I make it several levels, other times I can't make it past the first (setup with an impossible scenario). Easy mode probably shouldn't fluctuate the difficulty so much. This is something I would expect on medium or hard. - Frustrating that I have to take a hero with me 3 levels or beat the entire dungeon to keep them.

Mixing permadeath with healing supplies consuming the same resources as leveling up can cause some stress as you must make the choice between securing a team member's life and giving them a vital level up that'd make them stronger later on.

While no character has an offical class-type to link to other characters, I generally class them as 'fighter' 'operator' 'scout', etc.  The game has a pause function for tactical decisions in single player. In multiplayer, no pause is available.  Overall, I really recommend it. It is not often that I play something that feels NEW to me, but this game really does not feel derivative or evolutionary. It seems like something quite fresh and unique!",

            "review_text": "Alright where to start. This is gonna be a casual review. DOTE(Dungeon of the Endless, Duh)is a pretty fun yet brutal game. Each game is new, the floor plans being random, items random, the merch random. . .you get the point. Due to this it's a fresh start everytime! There are many characters for you to find as you progress your tour of the site. Leveling up is fun, but hard to those not prepared as the game progresses which leads me to the brutal part. It is one of the many careless early on mistakes one makes. The resources you spend in the beginning of the game will be well how to say it. . .very much missed. While you can get them back now easily, depending on how you alloct spending, higher levels means harder bosses. More resources are needed. Spent all resources on last floor. Is being swarmed by endless wave of foes and is about die/lose crystal. Being prepared is key becuase if you ♥♥♥♥ up, it's back to floor one. Though even through all of that, the game is fun, addiciting, and leaves me coming back for more! Awesome music, great story behind the characters, super pixel art work. It's just fantastic overall!  However. . .  While what I am about to say isn't the games fault entirely, but partly, is the Multiplayer. Now the multiplayer is fun. . .if certain conditions are met. The mp can glitch. For me the only game breaking glitch I've found is if the host, swaps through ships too quickly, it'll cause the interface to crash. If you leave the game, the character selection will still be there. Moving through different menus will eventally break the interface, forcing one to restart. Now, this is a rare issue since many people know not to do it expect noobies. My second, and by far biggest issue which is turning me off greatly, are the hosts. What you do mean you may ask? One word: Autokick. I seriously can say that 90% of all games joined, autokicked. This is partly do to that: A. The host has friends he or she wants to join in so they can go on and play or, B. The host, is just a troll and ♥♥♥♥ in general and has too much damn time on their hands. I'd like to see an option to host private games in the future, becuase really, while I can start a match sure, joining a game shouldn't feel like Russian Roulette expect here there are 5 bullets in the chamber.   Really other than that, DOTE is a pretty fun and challenging game and recommend it. 9/10",

Yes, you can move your characters around and use special abilities, but targeting and crowd control remain a bit of an issue due to the unnecessarily chaotic combat.

You start the game crashing into a planet after your ship was shot down by a nearby planets defenses. You will have the choice of 4 characters in the beginning, but you can unlock many other unique characters by finding them, buying them, and playing 3 floors with them or beating the game. Once you have picked your characters you will spawn in your crashed escape pod (which you can unlock more by doing certain things) and you will open the door into the dungeon, and likely into certain death. Whenever you open a door it has a chance to spawn monsters in that room, or in any other room that is unlit. You can light rooms by using the dust you get from killing monsters and opening rooms, hitting your middle-mouse button on the room you want, will light or unlight it depending on which it was before. Dust is probably one of the most important resources, among industry, science, food, and weapons and armor and tools that you equip on your characters. You will use your industry to build defenses, your science to improve the things that you can place and build with industry, and food will allow you to upgrade your characters, heal them, and pay for characters in the dungeon to join your quest to escape this hell hole of a dungeon. This game is also multi-player allowing you to get a group of your friends and conquer the dungeon as a group. Whether playing with friends or alone this game has many different escape pods (which change up settings in the game making it easier and harder), characters (up to around 20 I believe with the DLC's), and with the levels always different and the items being random, you can either get screwed or be the luckiest man on earth. But what makes this game good is that even if you get screwed in the beginning with good setup of your defenses and wise use of you characters and abilities, you can pull through and win.  I would recommend this game to anyone who likes a mix of luck, tower defense and the planning aspect of that, and the constant fear of the perma death from rogue-likes.",

Edit: I realized there is a pause button, I can't imagine after 20 hours of play I couldn't find it so maybe I was dull when I used to play this or they added that semi recently. In any case, player positioning can also be a bit of a chore, if you want your front line guys to take the first punches you need to click the next room then click back to to the previous room to get them to the front, same goes for the 'techie' guys and ranged characters, you do this but to the back. swapping if they are opposite can be kind of annoying.  Game can feel VERY RNG dependant at point, sometimes it feels like the games just gives you a level, tons of dust, great finds, other times you feel like your trudging along, every door is a nightmare, your whole ship is pitch black basically. overall you will get both of these experiences, but it can be a pain to get the 'really bad' ones early on before your set up.  minor general confusion about what skills do what exactly. who has passives that work together etc.  review is based on my single player experience, i did not complete the game on every ship but got pretty far and beat it several times on the standard ship.  Game is best played in half hour-hour bursts. It's not something I could sit down and play for hours but again, overall, I like the game.

Sometimes I make it several levels, other times I can't make it past the first (setup with an impossible scenario). Easy mode probably shouldn't fluctuate the difficulty so much.

As for the meat of game, you start by choosing a pod (game modifier) to crash land in and the characters to bring along in it. Gameplay then revolves around opening doors.

Problems with multiplayer: - If you only have 1 hero, you will break your Operate bonus if you go to interact with any level features, like shops, new heroes, research crystals, etc.  - You can't trade or give picked up items to other players, except by selling / buying to a merchant, which ends up costing your friend the full price of the item - If a player loses their only hero, you can't transfer control of an extra one to them, so the run is over - Finally, and most glaring... you are unable to save in multiplayer. This means any runs you do have to be done in one full run, which could take hours.   On a different note, a lot of the abilities and skill descriptions are worded in the most confusing possible way, which will leave you wondering what they mean. They read like a cut and paste from Google translate.   Items in shops often grant a specific passive bonus, but don't explain what the passive bonus actually does, which is frustrating when you are new, since you'll have to look it up in a wiki or something.  Finally, some of the rules are not easy to understand. In our latest run, we opened a door and enemies spawned like normal, then suddenly all of the doors on the level opened, and more enemies spawned. It was as if we had picked up the crystal, but we had not, we had only opened a door. Why did that happen? No idea, the game provided no indication.  It is fun in the few hours I've played. The core game offers a lot of strategic and resource management decisions that must be made. I mainly wish that the co-op was properly implemented. It is deceiving to say that co-op is in when it has gamebreaking deficiences like being unable to save progress and continue later.",

(since we are supposed to take the game slowly and put more thought into it) we clear everything out, russian takes crystal and gets to the exit 'YESS!!! NICE!!!!' ...we left the only smart person on our team behind on 'accident'. russian gets kicked mid-elevator scene glitch occurs with our only smart person, he can no longer play the game and we are all frozen in the middle of the starting room on his screen. he also doesn't ever run out of resources. we get around 3000 resources in every slot. I max out skroig, he becomes a god next floor, the smart dude still isn't returned in his normal state he leaves we go through floor and find exit fairly quickly, also find elise, who i buy not much conversation happens, me and my friend win the game using misha, elise, skroig, and purple guy whose name I never learned... ...and an insane amount of generators.",

I don't have the feeling that it is scaling nicely but again you don't see the level and not the damage of the monsters so i have no idear but from experience regen is often a lot more usefull than defense. - no way to see the lvl of your minor modules well unless perhaps on the coloartion of the pixels... some modules scales with research and some other not.. really strange again - why have the DPS stat on heroes but not on modules? - Does tear gas debuff stack? - Does the slow debuff stack? - Worst tooltips every... hp regen =&gt;tooltip : the regenration of hp. really wouldn't have guessed this so 20 regen does mean 20hp per min, or perhaps 20 min between hp regens?.... defense tooltip: the defensiv capability of your hero... really? are you shure that this is not the damage he/here does? give me something usefull like 30% reudction of damage or absorb x damage per atack etc. - if you have fraction of ressources (which you have) then please display it.. not so hard... - Vendor is selling an item which gives me the capacity 'me first' yeah great but what dies 'me first' do?  This all are liitle details but the summe of all this just give the impression that the game isn't really finished and that they just stoped the dev at some point. Especially wen you see that they have integrated an album with pictures so you have something to look at but no explanation of how the stats work.... no combat text to show damages etc....  and then there is the hughe influence of random in the game... - The reasearch random stuff is just a pain, like wen you just don't get the 'best pal' for ages... yeah great i just start again... - The layout of the floors actually have a hughe influence on the game, some level 1 floors are acutally a lot harder than the level 2 or 3 ones just beacause of that, and then there is also the modules slots especially like wen you have the rooms around your starting point without any module slots which happens.... - the whole hero may be there or not well you will se and if not well start again... great... especially that the heros are not really balanced... - no 'door knockers' and sundely 3 of them in the same wave.... yeah good luck with that  besides all those stuff there are 4 points i really miss: - there is no sens of progress, once you have done the floor you start again whith a floor that is completly similiar to the one you just did... he may even be easyser than the one you just did.. the only difference is the level of your heros and the floor indicator on the botom right... - the dificulty differnce between 'too easy' and 'easy' if hughe and i mean after finishing the 'too easy' a couple of time i wasn't capable of finish the first couple of floors on easy... I am not saying that 'easy' is to hard i am just saying that I would have loved a 'realy easy' dificulty in the middle of the other 2. - you have to send someone to the artifact for reasearch? reall? even if there are no more monsters alive? So you send a hero from one side of the floor to the other, you wait.... you click your research, you send him back to the other side of the floor, you wait again..... In some floors it took my hero (with 30-40 speed) like 30s to make that run.... and ofc 30s back... - Once you minmize the game the mouse is not longer contained by the boundry of the game and the mouse just goins on onto my other screen.. only way to fix it quit the game and restart....  so to sumerace nice idear, hope a 2 is coming out which is more finished but for a game which cost a decend about of money way underwelming...",

Its like chess, with RNG, which is strangely very intense and cool.  A couple points to clear up possible misconceptions on gameplay. - You have minimal control over your character. You can move them to a room and use their 'ultimate' abilities, but mostly they stand there and do what they do (attack, operate resource generators, etc.) - Each 'turn' starts when a door is opened, and causes monsters to spawn (possibly) in any unpowered or unoccupied rooms. So opening two doors at once results in twice as many monsters (again possibly). - Hoarding resources for the later levels is critical. Dont just get enough food/science/industry to clear the floor, plan to take lots with you into the higher floors because stuff gets expensive.

The art style is nice and simple adding a delgihtful charm to the whole game and has enough going on to make sure you're never in complete control of a situation. The game does a good job at ramping up the difficulty and keeping you on your toes, as you may have cleared one level of the dungeon with relative ease, but suddenly things are out of control and half of your team have died upon the next level. Resource managment is the main part of the game, deciding to choose where to allocate your resources, whether it be on leveling up your characters, buying new equipment for them, making some form of defense or augment for your tower defense grid or even just building machines to give you more resources to work with. This does open the game up to a nice variety of play throughs as you can choose to rely upon just your characters to fight off the waves of enemies that spawn, or maybe take more of a focus on setting up turrets and slow fields. It's ultimately turn based and the room mechanics work pretty well as you also have to choose which rooms you actually want to light, as lit rooms don't spawn monsters to come and chew your face off. Overall I'd say it's a delightful and fun rogue-like that kept me going for a fair bit of time, and with different types of ships to really change up the game play there's always more to go back to. It's cheap, it's cheerful, you'll be stressed beyond relief at later levels as things don't go your way. Things never go your way. (More thoughts  here  [mozillogames.tumblr.com] )",

If I was going to hazard a guess, the developers got a lot of inspiration from FTL because this game has a lot of the same ingredients that makes FTL great fun.  This game is awesome. I bought it during the summer sale and spent all day playing. I haven't ventured off of the easiest mode yet but I am enjoying it greatly. The characters are really neat, love the unlocks, going to upgrade to crystal edition now, not knowing what that means because I want to give the devs more money.",

It is a strategy game because you need to plan your usage of resources and you can place offensive/defensive/support modules like a tower defense game - but also a tactical game as you can equip your team, recruit new people and each character has different stats and abilities. A great game overall, as you also get several ships you can crash with which offer different types of gameplay (play with only 1 overpowered character, get more science resources but all characters are weakened, characters cannot be healed, and the infamous Sanitary pod where you cannot pause ever and most events are bad!)",
