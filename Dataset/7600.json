The effects of terrain , random events ,the stock market , aggressive expansion slowly start to make sense. Like any Sid Meier classic- this one grows better with time.  Sadly, the multi-player aspect is gone . The graphics are surely out -of-date but in no way ugly. I had to download a patched file from pcgamingwiki - for a memory bug to be handled. Heck this game is old - ok ? It needs some help from you to run well on modern systems. But for me, the simple tweaks are totally worth the experience.  I wish this was remade today with Steam Workshop support and modern graphics - with no changes to the basic mechanics. Please Mr. Sid ... VOLVO PLS ?",

This game is much less advanced in it's in -game economy, track types, consist editing, and locomotive selection. AI will also sometimes have issues traversing your track, getting stuck in loops, or not using low-congestion bypasses.   That's not to say it isn't fun. You can still enjoy playing against AI or others, but it's more causal train enthusiast level than armchair railroad president.   The graphics are nice, but neither advanced, nor detailed.   Textures aren't that high of a resolution, and steam locomotives lose their tenders for the game. Overall, enjoyable, but not deep.    + Ease of Use  + Art Style  + Gameplay  -------------------------  - Poor AI Routing  - Mechanics Lack Depth  - Graphics Could Be Better       Overall Score: 7/10   (Good)",

For more information, there is a tutorial in the game. Anyway, I also LOVE the multiplayer because you get to build with other people. But sadly, on the multyplayer mode they no longer have playing on internet, now you have to play with people on your local network who have this game. But overall this game is one of the best games I ever played because I love trains and building a good industry. For only $9.99 you can purchase this game and have a fun time.

It has difficulties accessing higher amounts of memory in current operating systems, but these difficulties are easily overcome with a simple download from a fan site. There are several fan sites out there, and they offer everything from new maps to historical livery for the trains. The module which permits the game to address higher memory also adds coal cars to the steam driven trains. Replay value is extremely high. The only question in my mind, especially considering what the sales figure as were, is why Sid Meier's has not issued an update perhaps with some additional content in it as he has done with his other great hits, such as the Civilization series. Maybe somedayâ€¦",

            "review_text": "I loved Railroad Tycoon 3 and Railroad Tycoon 2, and I'd read enough negative reviews of this game comparing it to the RTC series that I held off on purchasing this game. Well, since it doesn't look like we're ever going to get a true Railroad Tycoon 4 and this game was on sale for $5.99 I decided, sure, it's not any more expensive than a Big Mac Value Meal, I'll give it a shot.   Well, I can say this game wasn't even worth the $5.99.  I knew the economic simulation of the RTC series wouldn't be present in this game - no fluctuating prices, no inefficient 'Tycoonatrons' moving materials and goods independent of railroad to simuate how the real world works, no independent industrial growth. That was fine. But there are only 6 or so types of raw materials, and demand never ceases so all you have to do is hook up more and more supply facilities to the cities. Oh and there's very few cities either, and no growth caps - Los Angeles and Tehachapi will both grow into 'Metropolises' once you give them their materials. The maps are TINY and build out very fast.  At first I was pleasantly surprised by some innovations Sid Meier has introduced to the track-building mechanics: Tracks and stations can go anywhere in cities, no more tedious weaving around or knocking down buildings to get your station into a city, or having to locate in a certain spot to cover as much of a sprawling city as possible. Just plop your track and station down and the buildings automatically move around to get out of your way! Wonderful! Unfortunately, the double track mechanic is awful and making parallel tracks connect to each other takes an act of God. I found myself constantly having to build switches between the parallel tracks, and even high priority trains stop every time they encounter a switch. Even worse, there is no undo button AND NO BULLDOZER BUTTON so once you build a track, you're stuck with it. My tracks looked like disorganized monstrosities because of this, with trains constantly bogging down at a dozen unnecessary switch signals. At least there aren't any sanding/water towers required here...but it really doesn't matter.  Once you get into a position to buy out your competitors, make sure to liquidate their assets rather than absorb them, because absorbing a well-established competitor will instantly bring the game (and I don't run a cheap system) to its' knees with freezes and eventual crashes, and that's what brought me back to this screen, completely fed up.  I don't know how this game got through the play-testing phase of development. The simplistic economy is a disappointment after the fantastic Railroad Tycoon 3 but I can handle it.... but the track building snafus are just awful, and overall I find this game just wasn't enjoyable even when it does operate smoothly. I hope we get a true successor to Railroad Tycoon 3 someday.",

The rail-laying mechanic is finnicky and buggy, which is particulary annoying as it is the primary action of the game.   While increasing difficulty does offer more of a challenge, the mechanics simply aren't deep enough to keep me interested for more than a few games (which only take an hour or so to complete, which isn't an issue, but I mention in case someone saw 'Sid Meier' and thought games would be 7 hour long civ-like games).

I dont even mind that the maps are so tiny compared to todays standarts, but the crippled pathing tools just wont let you go to your fullest extent. Planning a longer route ahead? Cant do - build in intervalls and sell the last part of your rails again to try anew. Want an X-cross to enable trains switching track in one spot? No way. Even something simple as two trains heading the same direction on the same path? Unthinkable. And to top it all off? Its not running stable either. I had 2 crashes in not even a full hour.

Sometimes it's 5 minutes into gameplay or 45 minutes into gameplay. If you have Windows 8.1, you are more than likely going to encounter crashes. It's especially frustrating when you've built up a big network or railways and have not saved them only to have the game crash. I know I could have saved often to avoid the loss, but the point is a game should not be allowed to be sold no matter the price if it's not able to be played due to it being an older game. Re-release a fully playable version or do not release it at all. I loved this game in the times I could play, but the constant crashing drove me to a hard pass.

I've never been able to play a campaign without multiple crashes hampering my efforts. What's more, the AI is poor and the track laying is at times completely rediculous. Weird bridges over rival factions rail lines are the norm, not the exception.  Would buy a game like this if one was well made, but unfortunately, this is just tiresome.",

You can also buy into and build up industries across each map and there are plenty of graphs and statistics handy for you to keep a close eye on your progress. The graphics still work well even in full screen, and the sound is great.  It's just a shame that this game has never been updated.

This game is not a Railway Sim game that you need to aquire the keen skills of driving a train.  Most of the time I have played this game in single player mode againts 3 A.I. players. The A.I. can be ruthless when playing playing at hard levels. The A.I. generally doesn't waste money and calculates the best return on investment. With a bit of strategy you can compete for the same resources making it more costly for them to operate.  I have played this game on a LAN with four players. Multiplayer game play feels more like a single player map early on, Once you have expanded you railway empire, it starts to get really interesting as you complete for the same limited resources.   The game may eventually crash after all the players railways have grown very large. You will need to find the 3GB Ram fix to make the game work with large complex maps. There are a number of community maps / mods that can be really fun to play and introduce you to new areas of the world.  After playing Sid Meier's Civilization I found zooming out to see a larger area (FOV) of the map is very limited. This is somewhat like using a flashight in a cave, you only see small areas of what may be an enormous space.  Maybe one day they may entertain the idea of developing a Sid Meier's Railroad 2.",

Yes, it has its flaws - certainly, the track-laying could have used some work, and I would have loved more customizability with the trains themselves, but overall, here we have in my computer the simple joy of setting up a model train set and watching it go.
