I have 528.5 hours in this game, so I can safely say that I've been through a few releases up to version 1.0. I can't speak for the bugs folks mention, as I have never run into any that were game-breaking myself, but I can say for the folks complaining about lack of tutorial is that it's difficult to write a tutorial for a sandbox game that leaves the details completely up to you. I can recommend you watch youtube videos, there are some excellent let's plays that will teach you the basics. You're also able to turn off enemies if you want to go through the learning steps a few times.  Some cons though: Now let's be fair, this doesn't have the complexity of Dwarf Fortress, I don't know if that's possible for any game right just because of what I know about DF. But it doesn't say that it's trying to be a DF clone so that's OK. One other thing is I hope the developer continues to develop the game and add new features, such as more workshops, more armors, more weapons, more traps, etc...right now the game has JUST enough material to justify $15, but I can only say that because I've played it. If I did not play it maybe I could not be convinced to pay that amount, I don't know.  All in all I DO recommend this game, if for nothing else but a step towards Dwarf Fortress.",

            "review_text": "Ever heard of a little game called Dwarf Fortress? It cast a long shadow for a one-man ASCII project, but if you could get past the atrocious interface it was a bewilderingly deep fantasy sim. Unique projects like that tend to attract imitators, and that's where we get Gnomoria from. But don't write that off as a bad thing just yet, because there's plenty of room to fiddle with the original formula.  Gnomoria plops you in the middle of the wilderness with a band of eight stubby settlers and a few supplies. From this humble beginning it's up to you to help your little friends find food, shelter, and purpose in life. There are extensive commands to have them effect change in the world around them, including numerous digging options, room designations, workshop placements, and foraging orders. You might notice there are no direct movement or action commands, and that's because everything in this style of sim is treated like an open order. When you mark walls to be tunneled through, one of your gnomes that can mine and has nothing better to do will scoot over and start tunneling for you.  You have further control over the order system by assigning jobs to your petite populace. There are several roles like Woodsman and Miner that can be further customized with granular tasks like 'hauling wood' or 'stonecarving', giving you full control over the workday. Of course, your gnomes will wander off to find food or drink or catch a nap if their needs persist, but they tend to be diligent enough in their tasks to not cause any headaches.  What WILL cause you headaches is the steep learning curve in Gnomoria. I know all of this sounds simple thus far, but the amount of production systems to come to grips with is staggering. The number of workshops alone is utterly gobsmacking, including professions like bone carving and weaving. Production chains can be frustratingly complex, and the best example of this is making a single bed. A bed is made from a frame and a mattress at a carpentry workshop. The frame is made from planks cut at the sawmill from logs felled outside. The mattress is made from cloth woven by your tailor, using cotton grown on a farm and a bone needle from your bone carver obtained by slaughtering animals. Thus to make a single bed, you need four different workshops processing goods from forests, farms, and livestock.  There are helpful tooltips that will explain where to get component materials, at least, and if you have all the workshops set up then materials will be auto-queued when ordering a finished product. Little quality of life features like this help make Gnomoria easier to come to grips with, but it's still very much a game that requires a wiki. A tutorial walking you through the foundations of production would be a godsend, and it's a shame that will likely never happen.  You'll run into other difficulties like trying to dig stairs and ramps in the chunky isometric interface, or rooms not functioning and not really getting any feedback why. However, I maintain that there's enough charm and variety to keep you pushing through the rough spots. You are given impressive reign to tunnel and build as you see fit, and sprawling underground kingdoms are not out of the question. It never quite reaches the bar set by Dwarf Fortress, as you don't have a wider world to explore past your immediate map and your gnomes don't have the psychotically detailed personalities of DF inhabitants, but the accessibility goes a long way towards balancing that out. Gnomoria makes a great entry point for this particular brand of ultra-detailed sim, with enough features and polish to keep you digging for hours.",

            "review_text": "I first bought this game in June of 2012 on Desura. I played about 150 hours before I activated my Steam key. Since activating I've played almost 180 hours more. The developer has been diligently churning out regular updates and solid communication for the four years I've owned it. He has listened to the community and truly shows how early access can work well.  Gnomoria is one of the greatest base-building games ever. The random start conditions (and extensive options for customized starts) result in a new challenge each time. It's frequently punishing, occassionally frustrating, and consistently fun. Players can enjoy a complex village sim with emergent gameplay that rewards patience and perseverance.   There have been many who have described Gnomoria as 'Dwarf Fortress Lite,' which is not entirely inaccurate, but it's (mostly) modern UI and colorful sprites make it far easier to overcome it's learning curve. It's easily one of the friendliest dwarves building fortresses games out there.  I highly recommend Gnomoria.",

Scripting mod support (Lua??) would be gratefully accepted, even though we'd be wishing for a miracle.

It's a pain to learn the interface, but if anyone really loves survival/building games with a lot of micromanaging, I would encourage you to learn by watching a let's play.

With that being said, I am fully dissapointed with the final release, we were told that magic would be added, and wasnt, we were told that gnomes would have more personal goals and actually leave if those goals were not met. as well as some other things. The final version has been left up to the modders to finnsh. This practice in my opinion is lazy. Considering how long we had to wait for patches and updates, this practice is a slap in the face to all the fans of the game. I understand it is one developer, and i understand he has a life. But if you tell us one thing and then do another your no better then all the othe companies that took our money and said eff it. Please dont let this be the end of the devlopment and realy on modders to do the work, you turn them into free labor and make yourself look like alazy doosh in the process. Being a developer myself I understand the need to know when to stop a project. I also know that saying one thing and doing another is an awful way to go about your game. EA has done it, SquareEnix has done it, this does not give you the right to do it. Untill these practices have ceased the Indie community will be no better then the AAA community. Dont slap your fans in the face and be a lazy devoloper, mods are fun but content from the developer is better. I will recomened this game but I do not believe it is any better at full realese then it was when it was put on for early access. Dont let this stand.",

There is a surprising amount of depth and strategy involved, and a very interesting method for directing your gnomish civilization. People who have played games like Dwarf Fortress will be familiar, but in short you don't get to give orders.  Instead, you assign jobs to gnomes. You tell a gnome that they should be a farmer and chef, tell them how to priorize their tasks, and then you designate tasks that should be done. For example, you specify an area to be a farm, and that the farm should have hweat planted on it. The gnomes who have farming on their job list will take care of the tilling, planting, and harvesting as they can.  You oversee and take care of planning and organizing, but you don't micro-manage the gnomes.  Tips!   A couple of tips going into the game, I highly recommend that you start easy and work your way up, possibly even disable hostile creatures and raiding parties the first time. Also, if you do have hostile creatures, organize your gnomes into squads early, and put all gnomes into squads. Non-combat gnomes can be put into a special formation, and you can specify that they avoid enemies and don't take orders, then you can't accidentally assign your civilians to combat. If you don't do that, then all gnomes will fight to protect their home, which isn't always what you want. In addition, this will allow you to assign armor and extras to all gnomes, for example you can have all civilians carry torches in their left hands.  ",

Improvements I recommend:  - All corpses should be butcherable - its makes the ethics of the game more fun! - Gnomes shouldn't spend ages organising stockpile - put it down and forget about it. It doesn't matter what it looks like! - Male and female Gnomes should pair up and mate under good conditions. - Not everyone doctors (easily moddable). - Woodcutters not grove peeps (easily moddable).",

Carrying 63/64 blocks of stone in a wheelbarrow and would rather walk past the stockpile to get 1 apple the other side of the map to fill it up first. THEN he decides 'I'm tired' drops his stuff all over the floor and then comes back... WHILST HE WAS ON HIS WAY BACK ANYWAY. My gnomes then go out to clean up his mess, and no-one uses his wheelbarrow. They pick it up one at a time... BLEEDING GNOMES who are dying would rather bandage a sprained ankle than stop the bleeding. 3 bandages used and my gnome sill died... Digging, a major part in this game, is something you have to manage constantly! You can't leave the gnomes to do it themselves because they can't do it right. Telling them to dig a square out of the ground, they end up going for the closest line, which cuts off access to the rest. Or worse, they trap themselves in the middle, stuck on a single block. Bandages are insanely important in this game where gnomes hurt themselves daily just trying to eat and drink or sleep. Don't even bother having one try to fight a wild animals for food, because you'll lose 4 gnomes trying. Except, you HAVE to kill wild animals to get bones, which you need to make needles, to make bandages...  This game is like babysitting 9 children that live in a knife factory. It's not fun. Basic tasks are like trials. Everything has to be micro managed. In a game where you have no control over your gnomes, it needs you to control them, constantly. This game needs to either have it's play style overhauled totally, or they need to hire a programmer who's not lazy to fix the AI.  I wanted this to be the Dwarf Fortress with a decent UI that it claimed to be. It failed horribly. The UI is staggeringly basic and makes me think back to the days of Windows 98. Menus and submenus in awkward places with unhelpful icons. The one thing this game is meant to be better at than Dwarf Fortress, and it's awful. Seriously, for a game I PAID for, I was expecting more. DF is 100 times better. Gnomoria is nothing more than a cashgrab aabusing the pupularity of DF.  If you want a decent DF style game with graphics, I suggest RimWorld. It went for a scifi theme probably to avoid copy-pasting from DF, but keeps that gameplay. Focused more on a small colony and survival, it's different, but is fun for the same reasons. It's still in Alpha, but has a thriving mod community and hard working programmers.  ---- Another playthrough later: 5 months ago this game left early access, implying it was finished. This game as it is, is how they think it should be. I'd be more understanding if it was still a beta.  I gave the game another go today and found a gnome sitting at the bakery, I guess trying to pick up some bread? Only they couldnt, their wheelbarrow was full, so they just got stuck. Until finally getting too tired and dropping all 30 items on the floor. Which disables a workshop...  I've also noticed in combat that no-one has any health. The only way to kill an enemy is to make it bleed out. Even after injuring every single limb on an enemy, my gnomes will keep whacking away at it pointlessly. Sometimes even bleeding to death themselves before the enemy does. This lack of HP is why I just had my 15 dwarves killed by 4 beetles. Goblins are easy, but beetles which give no loot are as unkillable as any wild animal. The combat is simply broken.  I just still can't get over the fact this is called a finished game. I played it again just now because I thought I was being too harsh. And I'll probably do the same thing a month or two from now. Only to keep proving I wasn't being harsh enough.",

            "review_text": "Gnomoria was an addictive early-access 'Dwarf Fortress Lite' game centered around an isometric view, actual graphics, and the titular gnomes. The game is charming in its own way, the varety of gnome sprites brought a modicum of life to what would otherwise be smiling icons. But aside from Gnome looks there isn't much else varied in the game.   You have your standard farms and produce, your varieties of stones, a smattering of metals, a few AI 'kingdoms' to trade with and that's about it.  No, really. Unless you count the monster varietes, all of which but three can be countered by simply lighting your mines with torches. Skeletons, Zombies, Beetles, and Spiders simply aren't a threat to any player (read: most) capable of planting torches on the floor. The rest are periodic goblin &amp; ogre invasions that scale in size and armament with the 'wealth' value of your realm. Not that the scale of these will kill anything other than your framerate when you reach a point where you can trap them in corridors and let them starve to death. The last enemy is the mant, chitinous men-ants who spawn in numbers based off your food storage and can be completely circumvented by killing a scout spawned a day or so before a raid.  These threats do not become more challenging over time as much as they become higher in number. Attack frequencies never increase, there are no bigger threats, and they're routine enough to be completely predictable. The difficulty curve in this game stems from the lack of a tutorial and the creeping FPS death and bugs (both beetle cascades and crashes).  If you're wondering if the game has any mystical or otherwise big events/features/content, I can say there's none. Once you learn the mechanics (and the gnomish mechanisms), the game becomes trivial in the extreme. So yeah, 'Dwarf Fortress Lite' in the negative sense of the phrase.  The game lacks in significant and essential content it sorely needs to justify itself as a finished game, such as a deathcare system, expanded economics and management(No royalty/nobility! Though you might consider that a good thing) , and a meaningful way to interact with the game world outside your kingdom.  To top it all off Gnomoria does not support resolutions higher than 1080 and the developer has not and will never make any attempts to ever support them. Enjoy playing in windowed mode if you've a higher resolution monitor.  Gnomoria was good for an early access game. It is not a finished game worthy of release. Sacrificing the last 2 years of development to focus on mod support at the expense of sorely needed content made this game another warning against Early Access.",

I guess i should correct my comments below to 'Now that it is 'finished' you should not buy the game. The Dev has abandoned it progressively over the past 2 years and 'released' it just to pretend it was done.'  *********************************************************************  NOTE: Look at the time of the last Update. February 2015 and it was a minscule Update at that. If it ever gets finished (BIG IF) then you should buy this game. But honestly, that is not going to happen. This game is dead in the water  *********************************************************************  I have had this game for a while and came to it because i did not have the time to dedicate to Dwarf Fortress and also wanted something with more intuitive control system and at least minimal graphics.  My initial expectations were met but each time i pick up the game (after 3-6 months off) i come to find very little has changed of value. Development has slowed to the point where it is a legitimate shock when there is an update and then disappointment when you discover that what is an 'Update' to this Dev would be a tinkering of the system in any other game.  If, and thats a  BIG  if, it gets released then it might be worth buying but it is essentially dead in the water and has been for quite some time.",
