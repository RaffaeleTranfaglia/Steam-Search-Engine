I never did have a chance to play this growing up but its an FMV game like the 7th Guest without the 7th Guest type puzzles. You're playing as the female protagonist, basically exploring and picking up items and clues to uncover the mystery behind the mansions previous inhabitants and the supernatural ongoings of your environment. It's reminiscent of the game Scratches or the Crown series but with dated full motion cinematics. The music composition definitely complements it's horror themed atmosphere. Overall, it's a nostalgia invoking story-driven point and click FMV game that may or may not be worth the asking price of $9.99. I like it so far.",

While this game may not be on par with today's games, it was made in 1995, and was pretty awesome for the time. It has the bad acting that is expected with an FMV, but that just adds to the charm. I already played through it and it didn't disappoint. It was exactly as I remember it jump scares and all. Money well spent.",

This is not the kind of game that you should be playing, young man! Isn't there anything more productive you can do with your time? Don't you have homework you should be doing?  What's that? Oh, your REAL FATHER let's you play these kinds of games all the time? Well, where is he? Huh? He's off in Atlantic City, drinking his life away and humping random women instead of being here to take care of you and your mother! I'm here! I care! That's why I say you should NOT be playing this game! This is a horrible game for children to play, which is why it was never marketed to children and was therefore completely undeserving of the heat that it got back in the 90s.  The gameplay is fun and the combination of FMV and 3D modeled environments was quite revolutionary at the time. The FMV sequences, while at times cheesy are acted well enough to keep you immersed while playing, but poorly enough to give you a few laughs along the way. The game generated controversy upon release for some gory death scenes, which are still REALLY entertaining to watch, and one brief yet disturbing ♥♥♥♥ scene. With that being said, it's also worth noting that this game was created by the great Roberta Williams, a female game designer best known for creating the King's Quest series. So, you might want to keep that in mind while playing the game or before you get into a huff about it's content. All-in-all, the game itself is fun and worth checking out. It's not a port or anything, it runs in DOSBox, so it's pretty much the exact same experience that it was in the 90s so no real bugs as far as porting is concerned but that also means you shouldn't expect any real enhancements, either. The game is a classic and I highly recommend it to any other stepdads out there.  I'm sorry, what? NO, YOU CAN'T PLAY IT! GO TO YOUR ROOM! What's that? I'm not your real father? GOOD! YOU SHOULD BE GRATEFUL FOR THAT, YOU LITTLE ♥♥♥♥! I'm sorry, please don't cry! Look, I'm sorry! I didn't mean to raise my voice or call you that. It's just that, look, this transition is difficult for all of us, Kiddo! I care about you, I really do! That's why sometimes I can get a little upset. It's because I want what's best for you and it's frustrating when you fight that. Your mother and I will always care about you, Sport! Now, who wants ice cream?",
