    "description": "Sequel to its successful predecessor, Battle Academy 2 moves the action east – to the bloodied plains of Mother Russia. When a gritty new look, great new features, and random mission generation meet battle-proven gameplay you can be sure of a turn-based strategy classic!",

            "review_text": "First Impressions Launch Review (5hrs):  Note: I have not played Battle Academy 1, so I won't be comparing the two.  The first thing about Battle Academy 2: Eastern Front that caught my eye was the spotting system. Infantry units can hide in forests, buildings and fortifications, from which they can only be seen if enemy infantry moves into an adjacent space, a rare scout unit moves in, or they open fire on an enemy that gets too close. Infantry are also equipped with a limited number of anti-tank charges. You can see where I'm going with this. This system creates some of the most impressive and intense urban combat I've seen outside of an FPS, with machine guns and armor laying down massive amounts of supressing fire at suspected enemy positions while an infantry squad sneaks up to the building to confirm that the enemy is actually there and then assault them, clearing the way for the tanks to move down the road.  Battle Academy 2 is a small-scale turn-based tactical game, where individual squads and vehicles are used on a square-based map, instead of the now standard hexagon. but the different movement system works just as well, with the added bonus of not looking terrifyingly complex. Come on, wargamers, you know your eyes bugged out a little the first time you saw a giant map covered in hexagons. No, just me? Okay...  Anyway, despite the nonstandard level design, BA2's combat system carries itself very well, tracking everything from the varying thickness of armor on different parts of a vehicle to unit morale, which if reduced far enough can lead troops to hunker down, run, or even surrender, effectively destroying a unit simply by shooting at it enough. Armored combat is very slow, with tanks rarely having over a 35% chance of destroying their target, and even that requires a good shot at the tank's side. This then stresses the importance of infantry for getting in close and disabling a dug-in tank through close assault. But then you have to decide between the long, hidden trek through the woods or the quick dash through the fields, not knowing weither or not the enemy has a machine gun team set up in that shack over there. This game is about cover and concealment: a rifle squad caught in the open is a rifle squad as good as dead, but a rifle squad tucked away in a house at an intersection is a roadblock that is going to make a serious mess out of any transports that happen to pass by.  The spotting system and the ability for units to fire during the enemy's turn if a target presents itself makes defense about positioning for maximum-range engagement, to keep the enemy in the dark as to your whereabouts, and offense about supression and movement. Reducing an enemy's morale to 50% supresses them, which prevents them from employing reaction fire. This means that one squad can keep the enemy's head down while the other moves up and starts firing while the other advances, bounding back and forth until they reach their target.  On the technical angle, BA2 is surprisingly well put-together for a launch-day game these days. Five hours in and I have encountered three very minor bugs: a T-34 texture not loading properly, resulting in a cyan and pink piece of armor that I dubbed my party tank, a single line of text that repeats itself, and a minor glitch with the UI that makes the move/attack options menu deactivate if you scroll over an option that overlaps the bottom HUD (fixable by moving the camera so the space you clicked is closer to the middle of the screen.)  Overall, Battle Academy 2: Eastern Front is a well-done game that stays out of simulator territory while still offering a large amount of depth on a small-scale battlefield where every unit counts.  Recommended for: Hardcore wargamers, hobby wargamers, budding wargamers, WWII enthusiasts, Advance Wars veterans looking for something bigger.",

            "review_text": "This is a fun and interesting wargame as long as you are not too big on accuracy, and are not a grognard, such as I am (Since 1973). I bought this game with the expectation that it was close to Combat Mission, which I had owned and played a number of years ago, but was disappointed to find that a lot of the realism I saw in Combat Mission is simply missing from this game. Some examples:   I am well into playing the Barbarossa campaign and I have only had a single indirect fire weapon, a mortar unit, available to my forces in just one single scenario of several of the campaign! No indirect fire artillery at all so far! Seeing how Germans and Russians were big users of artillery of all types you can see how unrealistic this is.   Squad sizes are totally unrealistic. Typical so-called 'squads' in the game are 5 or 3 soldiers.   No platoon or company HQs type units at all. Everything functions on an individual basis in this game. Leadership effects seem to be totally absent in this game.   Direct fire artillery is limited only to anti-tank guns, at least so far from what I have experienced in the campaign.   No way to entrench your units or build fortifications during the course of the scenario.   No barbed wire or concertina that you can build during the course of the scenario.   No mines of any kind you can emplace or remove during the course of the scenario.   Engineer squads, except for their satchel charges, are essentially useless in this game.   No bridging you can emplace during the scenario.  If I could I would give an average/good overall rating to the game but not a great game. Unfortunately the rating system only allows Yes or No so I am giving this a No recommendation. Recommended if you want just a 'wargame Lite' or beer and pretzels style gaming experience.",
