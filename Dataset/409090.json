            "review_text": "I was given this game for review purposes.  It's a great game with a lot of potential. The storyline is fascinating, the puzzles are the appropriate level of difficulty and it breaks away from your standard hidden object feel. They don't have a panel where you have to find unrelated things to the game (i.e. find 10 umbrelas so you can get 1 screw type thing). I would classify it as a puzzle-novel with a hidden object feel. In any case, it's a nice little game and you should give it a try!  Pros: -Good voice acting -Nice music -Beautiful artwork -Intriguing story -Fun puzzles  Cons: -The 'hints' might not be helpful at times -Some puzzles are not explained well -The lack of a Journal or some type of Document of clues you find (i.e. number combinations used later) can be a little frustrating at times.   Mehs: -Kind of short  Overall, I'd give it a 8.75/10",

            "review_text": "This is not an Hidden Object Game. There is some resource gathering of objects laying around the scene but not like a hidden object game. This is bacisally a point and click puzzler. And far to many of the puzzles involve random guessing instead of logical planning. The art work and music are good but the game play is not. And the possible good story is tied down by tedius puzzle play. If you get this game in a bundle it might be worth a try but I can not reccomend the game at all.",
