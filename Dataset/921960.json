    "description": "Koliseum Soccer VR is the most epic game of table soccer in VR. Also called Babyfoot, Foosball or Kicker, it is one of the most iconical arcade game ever. We recreated the gameplay that everyone knows but with a twist. Now you can dribble your way to the goal, manage to keep a clean sheet when 3 balls are on the pitch... and many more!",
