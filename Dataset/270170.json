The game purposely crosses out options that allow you to fight depression which is stupid in this game's 'choose your own adventure style'. I want to help my character get better like I should in real life, not 'you can't do option 1 because you're depressed'. The character you're thrown into is cliche and like a 15 year old Tumblr teen's vision of depression. If you're depressed or not, don't play this at all. Don't waste your time.  ",

I should have immediately seen the name 'Zoe Quinn' and deleted the game, but I tried to give it an objective playthrough.  While it does begin with the caveat that all experiences are not the same...this isn't even close to what many of us have experienced. This should be called 'Late 20's Male Depression Quest' as it is just a small window into a male in (what I'm assuming) his late 20's and how his relationship falls apart with his girlfriend.  It makes my stomach churn that when they were writing this they probably imagined all the tumblrettes jumping for joy that, 'Finally, our disease has an interactive experience!' Eugh.  If you really want to know something about mental disorders I suggest you play a game like The Cat Lady, Downfall, Masochisia, or any number of horror titles available on Steam. While they are a bit more fantastical in nature - they are a hell of a lot more real when it comes to how a mental disorder can affect one's life.  Seriously, why...for anyone who has played this and ISN'T depressed, it makes it seem like, 'Hey now I can go to my friend and help him and/or her by just lending an ear! Teehee!' Yeah...depression isn't that easily fixed.  0/10. I legitimately tried to identify with it.",

            "review_text": "Depression Quest for all its stated aims and intentions doesn't quite achieve what it wished to. Although I applaud the intentions of the development team, the execution fails miserably.  Whatever genre/style etc of game you play one of they key focuses is on creating an immersive environment. The first faux pax 'Depression Quest' commits is to intentionally alienate the player through the constant use of the accusative pronoun 'you'. Being constantly reminded that you are a player and not the game's protagonist means it is increasingly difficult to actually empathise with Alex. This deliberate alienation between player and game actually detracts from the stated aim which is to 'help people understand what it is like to be depressed'. The over-use of the pronoun also makes the game appear to be controlling the action and outcomes, rather than the player. (Alright that's a highly subjective statement so I will clarify it further). When using accusative pronouns, we are telling others what we think about them or what to do. As the only interaction the player can engage in is choosing options, using the accusative makes the game appear as if it is telling us what to do, essentially coding a response, rather than the player having the illusion of control. This is particularly compounded by the fact that the choices are also phrased in the accusative... i.e. 'You choose to stay at home and watch Netflix'. Now the styling of 'Choose your own adventure' does use the pronoun you, but usually only when asking the player a question. Questions are a direct, overt engagement that break the narrative (and consequently breaks immersion), this isn't necessarily the developers fault, it's a fault of the format, but when juxtaposed against the larger narrative it serves to further alienate the player from the story. The sad thing is this could have been easily overcome by simply rewriting the game as a journal, blog or diary and so switching to the pronoun 'I'. (This is actually a viable option as many counsellors, social workers, psychologists and psychiatrists encourage the keeping of a diary or journal as part of therapy). The writing is tediously unimaginative and dull, and simply fails to hold interest. There is little use of metaphor, simile or any sort of figurative or descriptive language. Now, this may have been a stylistic choice on the part of the writer, Patrick Lindsey, but it doesn't pay off. In other media we have been exposed to vigorous compelling accounts of people who have suffered from Depression, from Woolfe to Wurtzel with Plath inbetween. Lindsey has borrowed nothing from their style and in choosing to create a 'factual' account has lost the lyricism that allows people to emotionally engage with a piece of writing (or game).  Lindsey isn't all bad though, his characterization is consistent and the narrative account is well researched. In fact I can recommend the portrayal of Depression at least. Three of the methods for coping and dealing with Depression are emphasised, the two most obvious are Therapy and Medication (primarily emphasised visually but also within the narrative itself), and the narrative additionally reveals the need for support systems, whether from a close loved one, family or friends. He also manages to note the relapse stages of depression through his characterization, however the game suffers from a lack of dialogue or choices within counselling/therapy. Even when you do opt for the counselling you aren't able to interact with the psychiatrist by giving or receiving information from her, information is only supplied through friend/family/girlfriend interactions. This means that, again the developers have managed to exclude a great deal of important information regarding coping techniques that would have enhanced the game by providing more interactions and improved their narrative discourse to meet their intention of informing people. Visually I presume they wanted to adopt a minimalist style, to better evoke depression. The colours are primarily shades of grey and the background is left a neutral white. The choice of font is similarly plain and clearly legible. In addition a variety of pictures are included to accompany the text, in an attempt to enhance visual appeal as well as serve a function of assisting in a display of how depressed Alex is. This is done by increasing the amount of 'noise' overlying each picture and the text at the very bottom of the screen when he begins to suffer greater depression and decreases as he returns to an equilibrium state. It's a clever idea and it works fairly well, at least in the case of the pictures. On the text at the bottom of the screen however, it merely serves to distract from readings of the text by annoyingly catching attention in some sort of entoptic diversion. The pictures themselves are at least evocative, and add some much needed emotional colour to what is otherwise a rather drab piece. Now again, Depressed people do suffer from dampened emotions so the choice may have been a stylistic one on the part of the developers, but if you are making a game for non-depressed people to engage with you need to convey lethargy and despondency through your medium which Depression Quest would appear to, intentionally, refuse to do and so fail.  The music is suitably doleful, and repetitive, which does assist the atmosphere when reading the story. In fact my response is slightly different to most in that I don't find it annoying, its chords become familiar and in a way reassuring, blurring off into background noise, and not overtly intruding, allowing one to focus on the text. I didn't however notice any substantial change in the music depending on your depression level, in fact it doesn't even tranpose to a 'happier' key, so I was slightly disappointed there.  In conclusion, I applaud the intentions of the game to attempt to recreate what depression is like, however it alienates the player, is riddled with poor design decisions, and utterly fails to capture attention or interest despite being well researched. Instead of playing this go read Viktor Frankl's 'Man's Search for Meaning' instead.",

            "review_text": "Oh wow. So, like almost everybody else, I've heard about this thanks to all the controversy surrounding Zoe Quinn and I went into it quite negatively biased. Anyway, I wanted to see what all this fuss was about and I'll try to sum up my thoughts as objectively as I can in this post.   So, with all that out of the way, is Depression Quest a good game? First of all, it's not much of a game. It's done in the classic choose-your-own-adventure style, but it's not done very well. Your choices don't affect the main course of the game very much - they mostly just affect your character's status.  Generally you just get a wall of text and a few options (which options you get depends on your character's status) and you choose one of them. This may cause a change in your character's status, e.g. it can make you more or less depressed. Then you get another wall of text which is a reaction to you choice and then you move on to the next event.  And that's it. Most of the game follows exactly this formula and you shouldn't expect any extensive branching - there isn't any. The only change is right at the very end, and that's simply not enough.   The other problem is that it's quite easy to get a good ending - just pick the choices that make your character actually DO something. And of course it's equally easy to get a bad ending - just pick the choices that make your character do nothing. Usually the choices are even ordered from good to bad, so you really don't need to think about them too much.   Unfortunately all the above means that there is not much replay value. You may go through the game two or three times just to be able to read the different endings, but you really will not be reading all the stuff before that.   Technically the game is alright. Although for some weird reason it has to run in three processes which in total use more than a hundred megs of RAM. I guess it's got something to do with the fact that the game is using Webkit. There's a graphical glitch when the text is shorter than what fits on your screen, but that doesn't cause any problems.   There are a few typographical mistakes, but nothing serious (there will probably be more mistakes in this post than there are in the game :P). I haven't noticed any bad grammar or misspellings.   What is kind of annoying is the sound. Basically, it's just a single repeating piano track which gets boring quite fast. There are some ambient noises for some of the events but nothing major.   And finally we get to the last part. This game obviously deals with depression, which is quite a strong emotional theme. So, did I feel depressed when playing this? Not exactly, although it did show me how a person with depression might feel - or at least I think so.   All in all it's not a great game. The mechanics are weak and the depression part just doesn't do it for me, but that is most likely subjective.   Finally, I do feel that it doesn't deserve all the publicity it's getting, but hey, at least it's free.   tl;dr: I felt more depressed when I couldn't find the bloody keys in Doom.   ",

Most of it felt like filler and there really was no motivation to read the filler. The story was boring and really didn't leave a lasting impression on me. I literally stuck it out just so I could say I got through it.  As a game, this thing falls flat on its face. The interface feels like it was ripped directly from a blogging website, and I'm not usually one to whine about graphics. The best choices are glaringly obvious, and better yet, crossed out. I did notice in the pages of filler that the author provided a 'suitable explanation' for the crossed out options. The rest of the choices, as far as I can tell, have no effect on the storyline at all. There is no reason to finish this game besides to say 'I finished'. I can't reccomend this to anyone. It's dull.  Quick edit here: If this were a book, I wouldn't have read it. Wouldn't have even skimmed the contents, so I can't REALLY review this game fairly. Regardless, I still cannot reccomend this game to my friends.",

I understand someone depressed (or just anti social) might not want to do those things but they dont add anything to the game.

            "review_text": "I heard about this game from all of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that last few days revolving around its creator. I was diagnosed with severe depression in high school and went though several anti-depressants and therapists. I'm now in my last semester of college and all is going well but High School was rough on me but mostly on my family. So, I was thinking that I could possibly be able to relate to this game because of my past experiences. I could not, this is not a good representation of depression and it is not a good representation of video games, hell it isn't even a game.   Ok, so what is the game? It is a text based adventure where you are given a set of text and then have to choose a reponse based on that. These response are in the form of hypertext and this could basically be a webpage and there would be no difference. Whatever, the actualy gameplay is bland but it is text based, what would you expect?  My core issue here lies in the representation of depression and the way the 'adventure' is set up. So it starts you as a depressed person with not much context as to how you got there. Then, it throws you in with a cast of characters who seem to want to help you but no matter what I did my character was constantly in a downward spiral. It seemed like the creator was under the impression that a depressed person can only be helped by therapy and SSRI's (anti-depressants). This game perpuates the idea (which is wrong) that all depression can be fixed with drugs and that all depression is basically the same. This is anything but though truth, there are thousands of factors that can influence depression. Diet, excersize, lack of vitamin D, getting a blood test to test for lack of SERT (serotonin transporters), or drug abuse. You do not have the option to explore any of these. No, you are on a downward spiral and you can't get help to get better. It is a terrible representation of depression because depression is something that simply can't be represented in a video game.  There are reasons that doctors spent years and years studying depression and mental illnesses because there are millions of factors and millions of solution and possiblities. This game is not just an embarrassment to video games but to people who are unlucky enough to suffer from depression and or anxiety. How this game got past greenlight simply blows my mind. I can not recommend this game at all, to anyone.   If you are suffering from depression, know this, there is help and there are people out there who care about you. I was lucky enough to have my parents and they are the the primary reason I graduated highschool and made my way into college. Please to remember, It gets better, I promise.",

            "review_text": "Despite the controversy surrounding this game, I was very interested in trying it out.   As someone who has had (maybe even still dealing with) depression, I was excited to see its entry into the gaming world.   Unfortunately, I found I was troubled by the image of depression that this game offers, and I have to wonder if this could do more harm than good.   It didn't feel as if the person the player is controlling is even a person. I felt like I was wheeling a wooden plank through a series of rooms, so lacking in personality or any distinguishable features that I found myself bored, and struggling to read the text that was telling me how I was 'feeling'. It worries me that the person this game is portraying is dull, boring, robotic. While some ambiguity and vagueness is needed in order for any player to put themselves in the character's shoes, I felt like that vagueness was taken to a point where we can no longer truly care for the character.   I was also troubled by the lack of options. As someone who has experienced depression, I know that there are times where it feels like options are limited. But people don't express depression in the same way. I have been the person that, despite feeling like death inside, I went out, feigned happiness. I went out and did things, even if I wasn't being honest with people, and that was part of my problem. That was something I had to deal with for years, giving the appearance I was happy and healthy, when I wasn't. I was disappointed to find that so many of the options I'd have chosen, the options that would make sense to not just me, but probably many other people just trying to survive, and maintain the life one has, were just simply crossed out, as if the mere thought of doing such a thing was preposterous.   I couldn't help but feel just a bit insulted by that. That my experience was an impossibility.   So no, I would not recommend this game. Not to my friends, not to people who have never experienced depression,   and most definitely not to others who have gone through what this game tries desperately to depict.",

Long story short, I had a really bad breakdown and then I decided to go to therapy. So there was some benefit to me playing this.  If you have depression, this is nowhere near accurate because, even at my suicidal worst, I was still able to make myself do things. The best ending in the scenario presented isn't necessarily the right one in real life. Medication doesn't work for everybody, there are therapists who are motivated solely by money and, in my case, people aren't always understanding of what you're going through. However, like others have said, you're not alone in the end.  If you don't have depression, the same inaccuracy applies, but I will say that it can offer some insight into what depression is. There are still a lot of people who think it's a choice/lifestyle. I think DQ busted that myth just fine, but it's not always evident when someone is depressed and there is a spectrum of kinds of depression. There isn't always consistency with depression. Believe it or not, we have good days too.   In the end, Depression Quest was a bit of an eye-opener for me personally. YMMV, but don't expect all the answers to be here.  ",

A lot of the thought processes, situations, and dialogue that are used in this 'game' are somewhat relatable to some of my own experiences. The not feeling good enough for your partner, being emotionally exhausted, having to pep yourself up for menial activities...It's a lot more difficult than people realize, and I will give some credit to Depression Quest for trying to shed some light on that, for the small hints of it that are there.   However, while I understand what this was trying to accomplish, there are better ways of doing so. This is not a game. It is an interactive journal essentially. It is trying to be a new-age look into a 'deep' soul that ends up sounding very pretentious. I just know most people do not want to sit and read walls of text(s) of sad things, which is probably one of the major reasons Depression Quest has been so negatively received. There's also the fact that the story overall really isn't even that engaging. I started skipping over entries after the seventh one and just clicked the most positive options to get to the end. I also can't stand the title. As another reviewer stated, Depression is not a 'quest' where you get a nice little reward for making it to the end. It's draining and exhausting. It's learning how to cope and when you think everything is fine and figured out, the rules change again for no reason. Basically, it's not nearly as straight-forward as this 'groundbreaking game' claims to be.  I read a bit on Zoe Quinn and her desire to create a more straight-forward game because all the ones dealing with Depression are more metaphorical and about symbolism (which I prefer personally). Well, congratulations Zoe. You created your snorefe-masterpiece!",

            "review_text": "When I finished Depression Quest, I was taken on a journey of discovery as I tailed the story of a man who has suffered Depression. It's a wonderful game with lots of potential and is crisply written and nocely noted.  Now what I say beyond this point is basically a spoiler and if you intend on playing the game, I don't recommend reading. But if your interested on why I don't recommend it, keep reading.  As a man who's had major depression, and has been diagnosed with Schizoaffective Disorder (A disease that makes it harder to comprehend reality and gives you immense mood swings.), I have to say that the justification given in the ending I GOT, is NOT the way to approach depression. It doesn't matter if the story has multiple branches and has various amounts of endings, it should all end in the RIGHT way to treat depression and not with the going excuse of just saying 'deal with it'.   For one thing, depression is not something you can just accept and just let it pass. Like any form of mental disorder, it can be treated with the right amount of medicine and seeing a therapist. It makes me angry seeing how a game about something as serious as depression can just say 'you have to live with it'. Depression is something YOU CANNOT just say go away to.  Now I know the game is probably vouching for many playthroughs, and it wants you to find the 'optimal path' to fighting depression, but the problem is that there IS NO SPECIFIC PATH to fighting depression. And giving the answer to people who may have depressio to just deal with it is the WRONG APPROACH.   With Depression, you have to be more careful in what you tell the public due to the numerous misconceptions about the disease. Depression is CURABLE, it's something that could be fought with help. Giving an ending that says deal with it is not only infuriating to me as someone who has known and has had depression himself, but also infuriating because it sending the wrong message to people.  Now what can I recommend to make the game more exact in how to treat depression and how to articulate depression better? I would make the story have branching paths, but have it only have one ending which is getting yourself cured. Giving the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that you just deal with it is NOT the way to do it. With a premise as important as this, you have to tell the right message and not muddle the message by adding mechanics that hinder it.  So that's what I think. Depression Quest is not something I would recommend listening to but would recommend actually playing to see what experiance you might actually get. From the looks of it, there's a way to get to the right ending, but giving an endng that just says to deal with it is not the way to go.  To all of those who have depression, please seek help immideately. Dont be afraid to go to a psychiatrist and talking about it. The psychiatrist is payed to listen to you. Don't be afraid if he will started judging you or something, because he wont. He will help you, and will get you better.  Spread the word that Depression is something you can FIGHT, not just AVOID.",

These symptoms are relateable by almost everyone with the fog or time moving slow at work but I think the game expresses well that depression isn't just these feelings coming and going at work, these feelings last for months and months. It's the consistancy that is emphasized.  The narration is a bit hard to read because it is written as a 20 year old girl and these situations are a bit over exaggerated in my opinion. The anxiety of parties and such are very real but the reasons we create this anxiety are not valid most of the time. Example, being in a crowded party by yourself, you feel as if every person is staring at you and judging but in reality most people don't even care what you're doing. The exaggeration is useful to help people with no base for depression to relate but it might give the wrong impression.  I get that the writers used a 20 year old character to help relate to the people who probably need something like this most and that is young adults dealing with these issues so I think the format works but I personally just don't like reading about a 20 year old girls problems.  I think this game really shows depression well but also shows the glaring problem of peer pressure and social 'norms' that people experience. Why is it so crazy to just hangout at a party by yourself and not really talk much? there should be nothing wrong with that and yet people always ask 'whats wrong with you?' 'are you okay?' I lost count of how many times in the story 'are you okay' or 'whats wrong' came up and I think that is the worst part of depression usually. No one understands and no one knows how to approach it and so they affectively make it worse. Thats what I took from this game.  I wouldn't recommend it as a game but I would recommend it as a tool to help understand depression a little better.",

Not good, not bad, interesting.   Objectively, it should not be a game. It's a work of (non)fiction that has the sole gameplay mechanic of clicking on stuff. It was mildly interesting to see that the logical things for people with depression to do in order to break out of it were unable to be chosen, but other than that I really don't feel that this was, in any way, shape or form a game.   The music was a tad repetitive, but it suited the tone of the game. Actually, its dull, repetitive grind might actually be symbolic, or it could just be lazy design, or an unwillingness/inability to find better music.   From the title of (non)fiction, I do believe that it's not unlikely that Zoe Quinn based the nameless character on herself. I ignore the developer and focus on the game, and the problem is that this is not a game. I refuse to make fun of the risk of depression, so I'll just say that this is an interesting view on depression and leave it at that.  This is a piece of mildly interactive writing disguised as a game. Only one thing in there actually piqued my interest, and that was the red text that was slashed through. Other than that, I recommend it only for you to play it once and then subsequently ignore. I have no interest in replaying what is, to all intents and purposes a website.   Overall, the game itself is, ironically, depressing to play. The dull grey background and the repetitive music give the player a feeling of intense ennui. It's dull and feels like it goes on forever, and thus you should get children to play it before bedtime, as they'll fall right asleep after five minutes.",

It's essentially just randomly clicking links until you get bored. It's extremely short too; when it finished, I hadn't even reached an hour of play time.  Audio: 1/10  The audio was just annoying. It's described as being an important part of the experience, but all it is is really plain and awkwardly slow piano music that tries way too hard to sound sad. There was also audio of people talking, which was... okay, I guess. The sound all sounded a little off but I assume that was on purpose.  Graphics: 0/10  The only graphics were small grainy photographs that appeared over each wall of text. Even without the filters, they look like bad amateur 'photography' taken with an old webcam. This contributed to the unprofessional feel of the game.  Story: 0/10  It's aimless. There's no plot. The pacing is really quick, and you find your character suddenly go from miserably depressed to 'barely depressed' in a span of five minutes. A lot of your choices have no real bearing on what will happen anyway. We aren't at any point made to care about this character, so we're stuck lugging through as a guy we don't care about moans about how miserable his life is. I don't know what emotions we were supposed to be feeling throughout the course of this game, but I assume 'annoyance' and 'boredom' are not on the list.  It's also not an accurate portrayal of depression. It's so much more multifaceted than it's portrayed here, and it's obvious that the developer has either never experienced depression or was trying to portray a blatantly fake, one-dimensional depression stereotype.  Writing: 0/10  Since this is a choose your own adventure book rather than a game, I feel the need to comment on the writing. It's nothing short of awful. To visualize, imagine everything that good writers do; then, imagine that the writer aimed to do exactly the opposite. The Choose Your Own Adventure books in the kids section at the library are more thought-provoking and engaging.  Overall: -10/10  Yes, that's a negative ten.

I've played some games similar to this style, such as the infinitely better Digital: A love story, and this one is kind of ♥♥♥♥. Overall, the visual style is pretty plain. Each screen is essentially block text of black font on white backgrounds with 3 polaroids at the top showing some pictures that look like something jacked from shutterstock. The game introduces you to the depressive protagonist, a shut-in with a deadend day job and a sympathetic girlfriend, and presents you with choices on how to deal with different problems in their daily life. This could be anything from fights with said girlfriend to adopting pets. While this could potentially be interesting, the writing is pedantic and completely artless. Normally, prose is probably the last thing you would give a ♥♥♥♥ about in a game, or you would at least be willing to look past it. Unfortunately, this is what boils down to an interactive adventure novel, meaning looking past the garbage writing would require you to find meaning or at least enjoyment in the menu layouts. The message is delivered in a very heavy handed and completely unengaging way. Each choice event is usually 3-5 options. Of those, 1 or 2 are red and crossed out options that those of a more balanced brain chemistry would most likely choose. Obviously, the player is supposed to see these options and feel frustrated, much like how a person with depression would feel, given their inability to help themselves or make the 'right' choice. Where a more talented developer would have used visual cues/environment/well-written script to make the player feel depressed, they instead decided to use a very simplisitic crutch. The truth is, I really do like these kinds of games. D:LS, Slouching Towards Bedlam, Cypher, etc. Unfortunately, this game is just really not good. To be honest, its pretty boring and nothing deserving of a download. I normally wouldn't even bother to write a review, but I felt that it was good to have some posts from people who are relatively impartial.

At the very least, it's somewhat informative about what people with depression go through, but it's a really awful 'game'. I was bored with it when it was a browser game I clicked through once, and I'm still immensely bored with it, and surprised it got onto steam greenlight with how little of a game it was. I'm willing to bet people only threw in their vote because they felt they had to because of the creator's supposed 'attacks because female' and will forget about it just as soon as I did.

Despite all the controversy regarding the developer, the game itself isn't inherently bad, and it would help you understand those who have depression better. But I don't recommend it because it's not necessary. It tells you what you already know about people who are depressed, what they do, how they act, etcetera, there's not much else to it, except for it being a nice interactive story about someone who is. If you like text-based adventure novels, go for this game, but if you want to understand depression, I can sum it up in a single sentence: 'I ♥♥♥♥ed five guys to censor criticism about my new game and faked attacks to myself on messaging boards to gain the sympathy of people who are ♥♥♥♥ed up like I am.' Oh, wait, that's just the 'depression' the developer had. But it's accurate nonetheless.",

I wouldn't even go so far as to call it a visual novel, much less a game, because the pictures placed above the text don't add anything to the story. Basically, you play as 'you', and you start out depressed. You have a bunch of first world problems going against you, and you have to manage all of these issues in order to get to the point where you're still depressed, but coping with it by the end of the story. I believe that the producer of this 'game's' goal was to raise awareness for depression, but I don't think she really was able to do so. She made it seem much like the misconceptions that overpriviledged people who self-diagnose themselves were what depression really is, and it made the whole storyline seem a bit pretentious. I don't think it's really possible for anyone to get anything from this experience, because quite honestly, it didn't explain depression at all to those who don't have it, and only maybe convinced those with depression that it does help to get seek guidance and comfort from those who are close to you. And with all of this going against it, the producer couldn't even go through all the text walls to make sure there weren't any spelling or grammatical errors!  Overall:  Pros: -Shows those with depression that they aren't suffering alone  Cons: -No gameplay -No visual aids -Not a correct depiction of depression -Grammatical/spelling errors all over the place  Scores: Gameplay: 0/10 Soundtrack: 1/10 (There was pretty much only one instrumental throughout the whole game) Style: 0/10 Graphics: 0/10  Addictiveness: 0/10  Overall: 0/10",

Secondly there where alot of complaints about the music and the dullness of design... this is also themeing... when you live with depression for long enough things do begin to dull but you dont notice it it hapens slowly over time in little ways, and then when you are finally free from the beast of depression everything else seems so much more vibrant. i feel like the devs where attempting to maintain that dull feel  lastly ive seen alot of reviews claiming that this isnt a game... lets start with the definition of a video game. a game played by electronically manipulating images produced by a computer program on a television screen or other display screen. DepressionQuest seems to fit the bill alright. and i know that its not funny or fun, but its not meant to be. its honest, its an expression its art in a way which is something that gamers have been trying to claim that video games are formore than half a decade.   and personally this game hit home for me.. i was diagnosed with major depressive disorder a year ago, but my therapist beives that i developed depression for the first time when i was 13, thats 7 years of my life i spent fighting just to do mundane things and thinking i was crazy because they were so difficult for me to acomplish. 1 in 3 people in the world have depression most of them dont even know they have it. just think about all the people that can be helped by simply playing this game and realizing that they arnt crazy there are other people out there who have the exact same problem.",

Just in case the name and the description aren't clear enough, I'll say it here: THE CONTENT OF THE GAME MIGHT BE TRIGGERING TO PEOPLE WITH DEPRESSION. Also, I STRONGLY disagree with the reviewers who said that the protagonist is just 'sad' and not 'really depressed'. There isn't just ONE valid way to experience depression and it's really crappy to invalidate other people's experiences just because they don't match your own.  So, anyway, it took me a while to get into it, but once my choices actually started mattering I found the game to be enjoyable. I also liked the way that the static on the pictures changed depending on your current status; it's a minor detail but something that I think really added to the mood. The number of choices you could make were also affected by your status, which I thought was a nice gameplay touch even though I was super frustrated that it kept me from doing some of the things I wanted to do (which, of course, is the point of the game mechanic). While I would have liked more choices that were ambiguous (ie. not clear which the 'good' one was), I did like that I was able to make similar choices in-game as I have done with my own life (and that the outcomes mirrored what happened in my situation as well). For me, playing through the game helped remind me of the struggles I've gone through, what I've overcome, and that it's okay that I still struggle with things.  That said, engine wise, I've played better Twine games. I am not sure if the devs were using an old version of Twine or what, but I didn't like how the three statuses (depression, therapy, and medication) were at the bottom of the page since that meant I couldn't just look at them whenever I wanted. I also found the writing to be clunky. In particular there was too much 'telling' and not enough 'showing', and also in the beginning your 'girlfriend' was randomly written as 'significant other' and in the middle of the sentence the pronouns would switch from being 'she/her' to 'they/them'. I am pretty sure that it was just something missed in the editing process, but it did highlight for me that the game failed to ask me what my SO's gender and preferred pronouns were, which is something that all Twine games I've played have done.  Anyway, this game is not going to be everyone's cup of tea. And I definitely wouldn't recommend it for someone who thinks they might be triggered by playing as someone who's depressed. But it's free and only 30 mins to an hour of gameplay for one playthrough, so if you're bored and in the right frame of mind why NOT play it? ",

I've seen some reviewers complaining the character you control is gloomy, lazy, paranoid, clingy... Well, welcome to the ugly ugly world of depression! I don't think the people complaining about the crossed choices quite get the point of the game. Depression is a downward spiral of negative thoughts and emotions, where even the things you once loved cheer you up. Everything is exhausting, even something as simple as making dinner or talking to someone. You want to ask for help, but instead shut down and distance yourself from others, genuinely believing you don't deserve their attention. Asking why you can't choose the better option is the same as asking why poor people don't buy money.  I think the good and bad endings could have benefited of more differences between them, simply to emphasize the importance of getting help and support during these times.

There are just too many types of depression and people in order to have one set definition.  I do have a bit of a theory that some of these negative reviews might be a knee-jerk reaction of shame. Such as us saying 'No, I'm not that PATHETIC.' or it could even be that you think you are far more pathetic than this. It depends on your depression I guess.

I'm not sure there's anything like a cure out there for depression, but I do think there's a possiblity of living life fully without it fully controlling you. I don't think it's easy to get there and it depends on each individual if we can make it to that point. I hope I continue down the road where I am relatively happy instead of how it has been, but I don't know for sure.  I'll take playing this slow, but for now I think it's worth reading just from the standpoint it makes you think.  Oh yeah, it's a 'Choose Your Own Adventure' book and not a traditional 'game'. Get over the fact that you need to read in this - the screenshots are not deceptive about what's in this game.",

I would advise researching 'Zoe Quinn' I wanted to type a whole peice on her sadistic, sociopathic, and manipulative behaviour that has rewarded her by taking advantage of the rampant corruption in the USA and Marxism of most media outlets with connections going to the highest echelons of this country, but I think looking into it oneself and self educating on this topic would be good.  Zoe Quinn is nothing. Shes a scumbag but learning how she got where she is and took advantage of who is important. It shows that even in Video Game Pundits like Kotaku there is massive corruption. I personally beleive if there was not a hidden agenda behind the Communist Social Justice insanity that it would never have gained the traction it currently has in the brain washed, PC controlled minds of so so many. Pay attention to these people for any amount of time and you will know they ARE Communists. They worship the state, they hate personal freedoms, and truly beleive some are just more equal than others. The USA is under a Communist take over. Don't be fooled, Communism isn't about equality so much as having all the power over everything in the hands of a few.   There is an information war everywhere around you, so many want to hide the truth from you and it would be highly advisable to join the resistance to these lies by supporting independant media. Places like Drudge Report and  infowars.com  are advisable sources. After you learn enough about the trends and real world it becomes easier and easier to see corruption where it hides.  Zoe is just a 2 dollar ♥♥♥♥♥ whose trying to take advantage of all this though, shes unlikely to be connected to anything big and no one should pay attention to her or all the brain washed men she has had sex with and now jump to her defence. If anything she should get a real ♥♥♥♥ing job or learn to program. There are extremely intelligent individuals with highly specialist skillsets that can make amazing games and its people like these that gets the spotlight? The only reason anyone would pay attention to Zoe is because of an agenda. Shes taking advantage of this, but shes about as much of a tool as any. Hopefully she wakes up to all this and renounces her ways, even then I wouldn't trust her though.",

Regardless, if you are patient enough to immerse yourself in the fictional character through the text, I think the experience warrants it. It employs one particularly clever trick - showing you options which you want to pick, but preventing you from picking them. This gives you (the person behind the keyboard) a sense of frustration, and through that, an understanding. Those banned options go through your characters head too but, like in real life depression, they  can't  do them any more than you can click the buttons.  It has some story telling issues, the biggest of which was that time was poorly represented. I suspect the events play out over many months, yet this isn't made obvious, and it feels like weeks instead. Also, it's 'obvious' which are the better options to pick - at least when you're in a healthy mindset - but I'm not sure how it could be done better.   If you're suffering right now from depression, this might make you feel terrible, but you might still want to persevere - it's a story of hope, as much as it is a story of depression.",

Cons: The game makes it WAY too easy to make the right choices. The biggest problem with depression is that it robs the sufferer of the motivation or ability to make good decisions. On my first playthrough, I ended up fixing pretty much all of the main character's problems. Yes, there are attempts to try and describe the precarious mental state and constant danger of backsliding, but it's just too easy to click on the equivalent of 'suck it up and do the hard thing' every single time. Also, the structure of this game just isn't very engaging. It's basically a choose-your-own-adventure story, with the added mechanic that the character's current level of depression may lock out certain choices.

I was able to relate directly to the experiences of the character you are to be portraying as I have been there. This game uses the mechanics as a metaphor well to tell you how sometimes an option is not an option just because you cannot get there.  This is a game everyone can take away something from. I issue anyone reading this a challenge. Playing through this, I want you to stop at each option and ask yourself, 'What is the opposite of what I personally would do?' Then I want you to choose that answer.",

This is a very tuff game to play. Warning you that. Dont play unless you think you can handle it. Very ruff read. Its like doing a maze, and just running around in circles. This games objective was to get the word out about depression, thougth may not have been done in the proper way, the way this game leaves you feeling, allows you to get a glimpse at how someone that suffers from this feels, 20% of people suffer from some form of depression, the 80% need to help them, and make them feel acceppted and happy. Btw, this is not a how to get out of depression, if so, id be a bit insulted about that, its not easy for people to come out of depression, and its never a cut and dry situtation. If you suffer from depression, you should reach out to a professional, or if you're a teen, reach out to a parent and/or teacher, that can help you contact a professional. This game, is designed, for a goal, and I believe it is impossible to describe depression, and that this is the best attempt/outreach about depression.",

While it does not always have realistic outcomes or potential choices, it made depression a little more visible to me. I beat this game in fifty-five minutes, which is a very short amount of time. I honestly feel as though they should add more content to this interactive novel. I would even pay $5 for a lengthy expansion. If the developers decide to update this game, I will gladly play more and so will other people. So in conclusion, while this short, interactive novel was a great piece of literature, it does have its kinks and would be worth a bit of money if the developers made a lengthy expansion.",

            "review_text": "I played through this game twice, and I can honestly say that I recommend it. However, there are a few things you should know before you get into it.  It is exactly what it says on the tin: an interactive (non)fiction game. 'Interactive fiction' fits better than 'visual novel' because it's almost entirely text-based. Sure, there are some accompanying pictures, but the text is the main focus. The '(non)fiction' label fits well because while the scenarios and characters are entirely made up, the underlying premises are very real. The descriptions of how the main character feels and what they're thinking are scarily accurate for someone suffering from depression. You can tell that the people who wrote this have firsthand experience with it.  Playing this made me anxious, not gonna lie. The breezy writing style lets you immerse yourself in the main character's persona, and I had some heart-poundingly anxious moments while playing this. The scene where you talk to Attic about what's going on damn near made me cry, because he said exactly what I needed to hear in that moment.  My only complaint about this game is how easy it is to railroad yourself onto the worst possible path, and end up with the 'bad ending.' The choices you make at the beginning of the game have much more of an effect on the outcome than your later choices. The degree to which your options are limited in the last half of the game is a tad unrealistic; having been in the depths of this debilitating condition myself, I can say that even at my worst, I could still at least attempt to bring myself to do things that were blocked in the game. I found this unneccesarily restrictive. I understand that it's meant to illustrate the hopelessness that one often feels when deeply depressed, but it still felt unrealistic.  Bottom line: this game is not 'fun.' It's not meant to be 'fun.' It's meant to illustrate the struggles that depressed people go through every day of their lives, and I think it gets the point across really well. I enjoyed playing it; the first time through, I answered the way I felt like I would probably answer if it were actually me in these situations, and got completely ♥♥♥♥ed in the end. The second time, I was actually invested in the characters as third parties rather than actors in my own life, and tried my hardest to make things work within the context of the story, and ended up with a satisfying enough ending.  Give it a try; it's free, you have nothing to lose other than maybe half an hour of your life, and let's be honest, you'd probably squander it by watching something stupid on Youtube anyway, so why not give this a try? Try to ignore for a moment who it was that made this game, and focus on the game itself; you might be a little shaken up, but you won't be disappointed.",

I couldn't really see this as costing money purely looking at it's size, but commend the creator on a short emotional journey I won't forget anytime soon. It runs very smoothly, as is to be expected from an interactive fiction. If I had any real money to my name, I would throw some money at the developer to try and get a book written. The detail in the text is phenominal, and really pulls you in to make you feel the main character's emotions. If I had to rate the game, considering the price, genre, and size, I give it a 9/10, could've been a bit bigger being my only complaint.  So when you have a good half hour, try this game.

Seems more worried about what others think and feel about him/her, than the way that him/her feels about him/her self. seems like its written from a female perspective, no guy cares whether or not he is holding his girlfriend back from having better life with someone else. so in the end i'd have to agree with my son, depressing yet ridiculous.

While the character you play is a fictional character with his/her set of hang ups, the events are all very similar: unsatisfying day job, lack of motivation, a dissconcected feeling from friends. The way the game limits your choices in situations depending on how depressed your character really emotes the way a depressed mind works. While someone without depression would see the solution is obvious such as 'seek therapy', 'confide your feelings with your partner', etc. the depressed mind does not work that way. This game is a good primer for explaining what depression is like to people who have trouble grasping it and can be useful for people currently living with depressing see how they're depression is limiting their sense of choice and that they should seek therapy/counseling to help. So on that basis, I have to recomend this game.  Also, I have to admit that I really only played this after being reminded of its existance surrounding the scandal of gamergate, and by scandal I mean the mysogonistic harrassment of Zoe Quinn, the developer of this game, on the baseless acusations of her sex life, and not whatever the haressers themselves tried to dress the issue as. Though I have to admit that I have been meaning to play DQ for quite sometime but have kept putting it off because of my own personal struggle with depression and anxiety, having it be on steam was a good motivation for me to get around to it. I can only hope that other people struggling with depression can find it helpful too.",

Normally when you think of depression, you just think of a person being sad about something that has happened.  'They'll get over it' you say.  But it's never that easy.  Depression can't just fade away.  And a lot of times, it over takes you.  You start to lose sight of who you really are, and your thoughts become so cloudy to the point where a rational thought is the equilivant of Gaben making a third instalment of a game.  And sometimes, even when it's 'gone', you think of it.  You think back to those times, and it trys to make its way back into your life.   I was depressed my whole life untill recently.  When I was three years old, I was mauled by a dog.  I lost my ears, and my face was full of scars to the point where I looked like I had enough stitchs in my face to patch up an entire leg wound.  As a result, I never felt apart of anything.  I was always a diffrent person then everyone.  I didn't know what I liked, I didn't know what I wanted, but at the same time I didn't wanna be alone.  So I did everything I could to try to fit in.  I became a shadow of everyone else.  I was like this for a very long period of my life.  Eventually, I hit freshmen year.  I was this angsty teen who had no interest in school.  I just wanted to fit in, and I didn't care how I managed to do it.  But then, I met a man.  He was a senior when I met him, and we had an odd first meeting.  He showed me a new side to life.  It was in that class we had where I learned about some of the many things I've come to love in my life, such as Gmod, Tf2, and even MLP back then.  It felt like a gate was opened for the first time in my life back then.  And what was at the other side of the gate you might ask?  A light so bright that even to this day, it still shines to the point where it is almost blinding.  I have three best friends that I can always talk to, I've been going to conventions, auctually hanging out with people on weekends and not being locked inside my house like a ♥♥♥♥ing animal.  And I have a girlfriend, a girl who I love more then anything.  I think the main point of this story is that you shouldn't hesitate to reach out to others.  Chances are, that person holds the key to the missing parts of your life.  And unless you try to find them, You'll end up another shadow like I was.  I can't stress enough how much you should experince this.  ",

It will give you a view into 'depression,' but only in an extremely narrow sense. Though the important introduction page explains the premise, it does not do so well enough. It is sure to alienate many people who feel that this story has nothing to do with them or their lives.  Actually, I think this game is valuable exactly because of that.  It's an ethnographic glimpse at the life of an  extremely  specific cohort of people: middle-class millennial Americans, most likely white. The issues won't speak to many of us: being invited to college parties, working a 9-to-5 job, trolling Craigslist for new jobs, owning a car, living away from one's parents in one's own apartment, having a girlfriend, watching Netflix, being able to afford and have access to therapy, etc. It's not just an issue of 'privilege,' as the introduction points out. Some of these culturally specific aspects would actually seem like  punishments , rather than privileges, to many people in the world. Living alone, away from a supportive family? Who would  choose  that? It's amazing that this entire cohort of people doesn't suffer from depression.  But that's where this game seems valuable to me: it's a window into the lives of this strange generation of people, who manifest in their personal, interpersonal, emotional worlds the brunt of capitalist America's crushing isolation.  We all live with capitalism, even if we're not self-centered millennials. We all can sympathize with aspects of the protagonist's life, even when it's unfamiliar (and annoying) to us. It's good to think with.  I do wish the developers put a bit more effort into the presentation: the design is drab, and though the music is fitting, it would have been nice to have some variation. I didn't expect to be entertained, but a sleeker experience could have made this effort more palatable.  A personal message to Zoe Quinn: stay strong and keep doing what you're doing, because even if it's not everybody's cup of tea, it touches many of us and adds something good and useful to the world. 'Gamergate' is an embarrassment to any decent human.  Finally, I would like to thank the developers for supporting Linux!",

I really wanted to make the main characters life a little better. As well as make his relationship with Alex work. Mostly because that part really broke my heart. Ugh , but really. This game is really great and it really spreads awareness on this 'hush hush' topic that is depression / mental illness'. As someone that has depression e.t.c I find this whole plot and the main characters feelings towards certain situations very realistic. It for sure shows off what people with depression feel like. Mostly in anything social or speaking about our problems / feelings. Don't really know what to say now other than that this game is really recommended. It's amazing. Really hits you in the feels as well as makes you think about your own situations and how you can relate ( mostly , at least for me , if you have depression ). I feel like this game with open up a lot of eyes on this topic. At least I can hope as well as cross my fingers. This game really makes me want to shove it at the ignorants that don't understand what we have to struggle with on the daily. Would really save me 30 plus minutes trying to explain what depression feels like and what not. 10/10. Great job!!",

Having played this in its pre-steam version, I highly recommend it to anyone seeking to understand or experience a particular perspective on the experience of pervasive depression. Those suffering from depression should note that the experience of playing this game can be deeply triggering.  The developer has been the target of a coordinated, baseless, appalling harassment campaign throughout the process of creating and promoting this game. The payment model for this game (that is to say, totally and completely free, with optional donation outside of steam) makes it such that the horribly misguided monsters who regularly attempt to silence her can appear in this review area without a pay barrier, attempting to commit further libel against her. To those looking for an actual review: this game is amazing, and the developer is by all reasonable measures a wonderful person doing her best to advocate in a state of near constant harassment.

            "review_text": "Depression is not a thing one can explain easily. An allegory of you, laying down in a dark room, with a dim light just out of your hand's reach is as close as I can get. You could reach the light if you could stand up, but you can't. You blame yourself for this, adding more fuel to the dark that surrounds you. The light, other people, whose lives seem to be all right, is the most disheartening thing of all. You just can't seem reach it, because it's just impossible to stand up. I claim not to know what depression truly is, for I am not or have been depressed, but that's how I see it.  Depression Quest is a text-based game that emphasizes on choice. Even if the choices aren't 'hard' in the traditional sense, DQ made the choices hard on a wholly another level. No other game has ever made my mouse feel like lead. It's just emotionally hard to click the button that leads to the next part of the story. Even if the choice before you seems to have an obvious good and bad answers, actually clicking the good answer is an challenge in on itself. At least for me it was.   Playing this game hurts. It hurts because you can, for a little while, see what it really means to be depressed. See through your own eyes what life looks like to another person. See, and also feel a little bit, how hard it can be for some people to even get out of their bed every morning. How even the most obvious of answers become hard when one just cannot anymore.  The way the game works enforces the feeling, and it is the intention. You are given choices, of which usually some are ruled out, but still readable. This gives insight on the fact that depressed people often DO KNOW what they could do, but they just as often CANNOT do those things.   In short, this game lets you feel the doubt and anguish that depressed people go through every day. The fear that what if the right choice is the wrong one, and what if everything goes into s**t even if you try your hardest. The frustration towards the people who do not understand, but also the relief when some do. It is a game that one should play... I was going to say 'if', but it's not necessary. This game is free, and it gave me stronger emotions than any other game has, in that short half an hour that it lasted.   And... If you are depressed, remember: there are always people who don't understand, but there are also those who do. The most important part is: you are not alone.",

I do not have an actual case of depression, but I have gone through times just like this, and I feel that many others have as well. Your decisions all affect how you feel on a level that most people don't really understand. Sometimes, the little things such as deciding to stay at home on the couch instead of hanging out with your friends can really be a horrible decision, even though it seems like nothing. Staying alone is the worst thing you could do in a situation like this. It's so good to be able to actually talk to someone about your problems instead of never talking to anyone about it, and being an anti-social freak. Now to lighten the mood with a quote from and Adam Sandler Movie: Anger Managment (Great Movie, definetly recommend seeing) 'Now, there are 2 different kinds of people with Anger problems: You've got the man who walks around everywhere and hates everyone and everything, and everyone does the same to him. Then you've got the person who bottles up all their anger, like a cashier, who is so polite and so nice, and everybody just loves him. until someday, he just goes and shoots everone inside the store.' People dont realize how crucial it is to talk to other people and get their feelings across. I highly recommend this game to anyone out there. People with depression need to play this aswell, it may trigger events or something in your past, but you need to face the cold hard truth, you can get better, there is a way, you just need to try to reach out. This is quite the beautiful game, one of the best things I've played in quite sometime, and thank you very much for making this, I hope this reaches out and shows other people what it really feels like to go through this.",

Even though it only provides a short playtime, I could easily connect with the main character.   DQ also gives a very factual inside view on what having depression is like. Not to say that I have had depression, the words used in the game truly help those who do not understand depression to gain insight on what those who do have depression struggle to go through. Not to be corny, but I feel like this game can quite literally change lives. Sure, it took me 0.7 hours to play the whole game, big whoop. But, as it says in the game's description, it shows those who have depression that they aren't alone, and that there are easily accessible ways to find aid and assistance from their friends, family, and loved ones.",

Imagine yourself put into these freakishly realistic scenarios, a strained relationship with your significant other, alongside, your dead end job. What are your options? Depression Quest does a very good job at forcing you to ponder over the choices you have made and ponder over whether or not you have the right choice. Even if these (non)fictional choices strain the relationships you posess or even the job you hold, the game still makes you think within the psuedo-mindset of being this depressed character. One aspect I really like is the use of multiple options, when prompted. In the beginning of the story, you have, say, 4-5 options available as a response to the 'What do you do?' question. As the story progresses and you make your choices, there is a point in the story where your available options dwindle to 2 or even, in one case, 1 mandatory option as a suitable response. This aspect of the gameplay really mimics a human being's lack of response during his/her bout with depression and gives a very good insight as to how depression really hinders our minds to think positively, negatively, and even neutrally, at some points.  Read. Respond. Think. Repeat.  These four actions alone make this game a must play.",

The game itself follows our main character (with no name) struggling with depression. It diverges itself by relying on 3 key stats. Your depression level, your therapy level and your medication level. Although this sounds very gamey, its all tied into the actions of said character. If you avoid taking certain actions throughout the game, you might slip incredibly deep into depression, thereby increasing your depression level, and from there closing out future options in the game.   So it is possible to view it as a game, instead of a novel, which many complained about. And honestly, if this game helps even one person understand their own depression, or helps them understand the feelings a friend feels, then this game coming to steam was totally worth it.

The game helped me understand this character's feelings and lack of motivation for life. It's obviously not a game for enjoyment, but it is a powerful tool in rasing awareness about depression. There is really nothing like this on the internet. I commend the creators for raising the awareness of depressed individuals and sharing this game for free. Suicide is real. I knew someone who killed himself. Despite the whole gamergate crapola, this game suceeds in it's purpose and message. I suggest to anyone who has a loved one with depression to play this game so you know how to be supportive and how to help your loved one get the treatment he or she needs.",

            "review_text": "After playing this game for an extremely long amount of time, almost eight weeks (of actual gameplay), I have come to a conclusion about this game and the hype surrounding it.  This game and later it's creator, Zoe Quinn, received a lot of air time because of the controversy regarding this game's greenlighting. People didn't like the fact that it received extremely positive reviews from critics who had had 'sexual relationships' with the creator or were supporting her, Zoe, monetarily. This created a media s***storm, and now there is a 'war' going on between the feminists(Anti-GG) and the GG supporters. For those who don't know, GG is GamerGate, which is a controversy about relationships in video game journalism. he controversy began when indie game developer Zoe Quinn's ex-boyfriend alleged that Quinn had a romantic relationship with a journalist for the video game news site Kotaku and four other critics on different sites, hence the '5 Guys Burger &amp; Fries' meme that was spawned. This led to harassment of Quinn, including truthful accusations that the relationship had led to positive coverage of Quinn's game.   All in all, this game is a tad bit controversial for reasons other than those previously stated. The creator, Zoe Quinn, has reportedly never had true depression, so it's not okay that she created a 'game' (Dare I call it that? The internet police will get me!) about depression when she really doesn't know what it's about and has never experienced it herself. I have played this game so much that I could recite everything in-game, and all of the storylines this game has. It is an okay game, but if you have depression, this won't be relatable. If you are trying to better understand depression because someone you know has it, then this will help you understand it more.  This is my third review since I first started playing this game. I create new ones after a certain period of time in case my views have changed.  tl;dr It's an okay game with a lot of controversy behind it. It can help you  understand  depression a bit more, although it's nothing like the real thing.  15/3/15: I hit 1337 hours. Sweet.",

It tells decent a story without being too artsy about it, and at the time I thought it was done pretty well. I'm not really an expert on depression or how accurate this is, and if other reviewers don't think it's accurate then I'll probably defer to them.   There are definitely other CYOA-style games available for free that are better ('Creatures such as We', 'Bee' and 'The Play' are two examples off the top of my head). But I guess it's worth checking out as freeware.   Also, I really enjoy any soundtrack done by Isaac Schankler. I think that's why I checked this out in the first place.",

For the most part this is achieved successfully, although due to the complex nature of the subject matter, the experience, or 'game' in itself is far from perfect.  The choice of text to respond with can at times be limited, lacking in complexity, often with one answer alluring to a positive ending, while the other choices would all be negative. Despite this, the narrative path that I was guided along had the ability to not only convey great emotion, but was emotive in itself, even reducing me to a tear or two at one point. One issue I did have was being unaware of whether there was any save game feature, fortunately the game is only around an hour long so this wasn't too much of a problem, but I was initially unaware of the length and whether I'd be able to finish it within one sitting.  To some extent my opinion may be biased, as due to my history of depression I can most certainly empathise with the main character of the story. Nevertheless, for those willing to take part in what you could call a 'Depression Simulator', there is a lot be learned from the mental condition here, or if you are like me, along with empathy there is some comfort in finding an iteration of depression other than your own. Above all this, there is a wealth of emotion to be felt from the narrative, although for the most part this is admittedly downbeat rather than happy; just a point to consider.  Either way, if you don't mind taking on a purely text based interactive story, rather than an actual game, I would most definitely recommend this title...I mean apart from anything else it's free isn't it, why not really?

I find myself identifying with most of what the character describes feeling, despite being a relatively happy person, so it's hard for me to say that the game does a very good job of actually conveying depression.  Now, every once in a while there are options for paths that are crossed out. I'm not quite sure what's going on there, there are clearly some things happening behind the scenes to determine what you can and can't select, but it doesn't give much agency to the player if they can't really tell, at the very least, if and why their decisions have led to fewer choices. If this formula were visible perhaps there'd be a greater connection that would convey the point more.  Moreover, the effect would perhaps be more dramatic if the very first choice you made didn't involve a crossed-off option, increasing the contrast when you fall deeper into depression. To be fair, the first few choices crossed off were definitely things I myself wouldn't do, and again, I'm a relatively happy person, so there's still the question of if this aided in the conveyence. If a player were able to make these decisions, establishing a character that would normally want to, then removing that option might be more powerful, but removing that option in the first place forces the establishment of a character that doesn't really help one way or the other.",

He seems to be surrounded by people who legitimately care and love him, has a supposedly well paying job, and (at least in what i've seen) doesn't have the very real threat of getting thrown out of his housing situation. Even just a small amount of context would have made him a more compelling character. Without it, it just feels like 'Wah, my upper/middle-class lifestyle is so hard' has made him depressed.   Beyond that, This IF visually limits your choices, without giving you any real reason as to why. Even the illusion of a choice would have made this a much more enjoyable experience.

The game has no realistic basis and I think it's offensive to those of us how actually have or know someone who suffers with depression becuse it claims to build awareness but after completeing the game YOU DON'T gain a better understanding of depression, or any form or resolve other than the resounding question of why did I waste my time with this poorly desinged game. The game is severly dependent on sterotypes involving depression like the need for medication and therapy, however in reality not all people need medication or therapy but a lifestyle change or the support of those they love. You are constantly reminded of how your not in therapy, your not on medication, and how you feel lathergic. The game fails to take into account how depression effects diffrent people diffrently.",

What better way to do it than into a game? Unfortunately, to call this a game would be stretching it. I have played numerous text adventures in the past that had more content than this 'game'. In fact, Depression Quest doesn't have much in terms of branching paths or content. The game feels far too short and, above all, gives the illusion of choice that really doesn't affect much. The game has multiple endings, but it will leave you very unsatisfied no matter which ending you get. Look, if you're really, REALLY curious, try the 'game' out; it is free after all (as of this writing). But I honestly cannot see why else anyone would want to 'play' this with its shortcomings and nonexistent gameplay.",

            "review_text": "The ending of this game states 'We realise it may not be the most enjoyable game you've ever played, or even the easiest.' The were right with the first one, but probably not the second.   Depression 'Quest' uses perhaps the loosest definition of the word 'quest'. The game is a text based RPG where you play as NAMELESS PROTAGONIST, a person who was actually surprisingly fitting for this game. His unnessecarily fortunate situation (sans depression) actually made me hate him. Which, by extension, made me - at least within the context that while playing the game, I am him - made me hate 'myself'.  I should, before I go any further, preface this by saying that I have no experience with depression, as a recipient OR as a friend of one. As such, I picked this game up mainly out of curiousity. I wanted to knowmore about the state of being, and what this person thought hepled to get out of it. Here we come to the point where I actually beleived the thing about this game being 'hard'. I found it extremely hard to actually play this 'game' properly, The writing it slow=paced and - well, frankly, it's just boring.   I understand that a game such as this isn't the kind of thing where engaging writing it easy - or even a good idea - to write. But when the game is so hard to actually get through that all I can physically bear to do is read the last chapter of the wall of text and make a decision based on that, Which, with the fact that I got what I'm pretty sure is the best ending to the game just from this, brings me to the next problem: The 'game's' difficulty.  This is the reason I've been doing airquotes around the word 'game' throughout a lot of this review. There is no failure state in depression quest. Nor is there a victory state. This game does not require any skill beyond the skill of posessing both basic logic and the LOOSEST grasp of anything even vaguely related to depression itself. It's alnost more likely that you'll be incapable of winning because you don't know how to press buttons than that you don't know what to press. Which makes me wonder how you can even define this as a game. The entire experience is just clicking a series of hyperlinks in whatever order you want so that you can make some moderate changes to the mental state of one person over the course of a few months. So not only does this game not function as a story, it isn't even really a game either.   So here comes the question of whether you should bother with this game. Well, the game takes 30 seconds-3 minutes from deciding to get it to playing. And will probably take you about 90 seconds-9 minutes to finish. Unless you are a fan of awful simulators, This will probably be less fun than any of the other games in your library, and less interesting than most of it too. So, unless you REALLY want to stick through this game and read all the horribly boring dialogue, you're better off just playing something else.  TL;DR, A boring not-really-a-game that isn't worth your time unless you're particularly interested in this one person's idea of what it means to be depressed.",

I went through a period of disthymia for a few years, and arguably I'm still slogging out of it.  It does a good job at highlighting the sometimes circular problems that can come up, even when you try to make a good effort. I won't spoil what you learn, because in a way it spoils the lessons the game is trying to teach. ...

            "review_text": "So, I decided to play this game and give it a fair shot despite all the gamergate controversy.   The first thing I want to say, as an aspiring game developer who hopes to one day get a game through greenlight, that if this is the new standard of what constitutes the title 'game developer' then 10 year olds everywhere creating their first projects in flash can rejoice with a sense of pride in their new title of professional game developer. What do I mean by this? Well, lets take a look.   The game itself is essentially a wall of text with a couple of highlighted text that links to more walls of text. This 'game' is more or less an interactive story that follows the same format as the 'choose your own path' Goosebumps books (if anyone remembers those?) After each page of text you are given a few options of how you want to react to certain situations. Each choice will take you to a new wall of text explaining your actions and following the resulting story. Some choices close off other choices later on (I assume, otherwise the crossed out choices presented to the user are arbitrary) giving the user a sense of control over the outcomes. It follows this format until the writers couldn't think of anything else to write and thus they leave it open-ended. They explain this in the game's epilogue where they conclude that the life of a person with depression does not come to a nice and tidy ending, and thus, the game would not have such a conclusion either. This would have been believable if it were not for the games writing.   The writing is horrible. Not only is there missing commas and other punctuation that would help the reader actually understand tone and pacing of sentences, but the writing style is written at a 7th grade level. This is not an insult as many great books and stories are written with this level of vocabulary and sophistication to achieve greater audience appeal. The problem with this is that the writing randomly throws in 'big' words and pseudo intellectual vernacular to give the reader the illusion that the writers are actually smart educated people. The writing, however, speaks for itself.   This brings us to the music. I actually quite enjoyed the musical score. As a musician (I think most gamers are to some extent), I can enjoy the mood and atmosphere that the music presented. The music did achieve its goal of gradually gnawing at the player (myself) with a certain sense of beauty and anxiety. Well done!  The layout of the game was very simple. If I want to play a simple game, like cookie clicker for example, I want the user interface to be outstanding. Now, I can appreciate the fact that a game trying to give a non-depressed user a lens to perceive the world through the eyes of those who are depressed, will inevitably be a little bit more bleak and bland. This however, is not the case for Depression Quest. The interface looks like absolutely no thought went into it at all. It looks as though it was designed 100% for utility and no thought went into aesthetics.   Now, for the 'vibe' I got from the game. This game dripped with the privileged and shielded eye of a white middle class female who thinks she understands the plight of people suffering depression. It was highly offensive, as someone who has seen, first hand, the affects of depression on family members, this sort of arrogant sense of superior empathy disgusts me. This game is equivelant to a middle class white person making a game about the social-economic struggles of a black person in poverty. It is a level of arrogance that truly warrants a gamergate.",

Simply put, Depression Quest is somewhere between an interactive short story and an online questionnaire/quiz -- not a video game. If this is a video game, then those online quizzes which determine which genre of Metal you are based on your answers, are also video games. They Greenlit this? Seriously? Hmmm?
