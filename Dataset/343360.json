I really love Tower Defense so I tend to have some high expectations; this one definitely doesn't blow my mind but offers some cool elements to make it worth that $1. So our group had a surplus of these free Particula keys (30) so we all launched yesterday at 9:30 to investigate. Verdict = Really Fun. I highly recommend the Multiplayer; you must bring your own friends though which sucks!  The TD takes place within the human mind. Your towers are some sort of brain synapses that must eradicate negative thoughts such as jealousy, greed, self-consciousness and other negative thoughts that would cross one’s mind. Pretty clever on that front; this allowed the minimalist graphics to actually work and make sense. The levels are quite long and almost AFKable with some friends  There are quite a few things that didn't work for me. There was no tutorial; I was super confused at the start. Stick with it because the learning curve is quick. Multiplayer 'works' but it’s dead since few play this game on the regular. There are only 3 levels to alternate between which include 6-7 levels of difficulty. This is cool but I'd rather have more variance in the maps instead. Finally, the chat box is MICRO; you can only type and read so much. Communication in multiplayer almost has to be done with voice to be effective.   Overall, not bad for $1! It's short and you need to BYOF (Bring Your Own Friends.) Free at Accidently Reviewed!     Accidently Reviewed",

This game has only 3 maps.  2.There is nothing to unlock 3.Very very little variation - the 5 levels are not a variation.  4.The 'Bad Thought' words seem to be randomly chosen from a list, with little to do with their bossness.  5. Weak graphics that get boring really fast 6. No Speed-Up button 7. Nothing in the way of maps.    I would really like this game - but . . . It really really needs more work.",

I loathe to give negative reviews, as I can generally find enough redeeming features in a game to make it enjoyable. This game was a 1/10 for me. If I try really hard (and cross my fingers behind my back) I would recommend it to someone who has never played a Tower Defense and/or is stoned.  The graphics are pretty in the way a neon sign is pretty. The game itself is dull and repetitive and although short in levels, each level feels much longer (in a bad way) than it needs to. The theme to 'Destroy negativity' is ironic at best.",
