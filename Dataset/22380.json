A few community made patches help with crashing and other obvious bugs in the game. (Pay attention to what is contained in the mods....I didn't realize one had a script that unlocked all achievements at once. I fail.)  Overall, I give this game a 9/10 even in it's buggy state.",

It's not often we can find masterpieces like Fallout: New Vegas, and when we do, we want to play every second of it, search every corner, search for every little moment it can provide us, and this gem... It does a great job at that. The dialogues and voice-acting are incredible and unique (See above). Every character you come across in the vast land of New Vegas is memorable. Every one of them has a story to tell, and it's your choice if you want to listen carefully or not.  Vanilla version has enough content to keep you interested for hours, the variety of weapons is huge. From Ballistic Fists to Anti-Material Rifle, you won't need to worry, this game has everything covered. If that wasn't enough, it's extremely moddable. Story is the strongest point. With multiple endings, endless replayability is guaranteed, and I'm not even mentioning the DLC's yet. I've finished four times already, and I will finish it again. Every playthrough was a different experience, and it was delightful.  It's definitely a must have, even for people who doesn't enjoy RPG's... Like me.",

            "review_text": "Somewhere between convincing a young boy to hand over the trigger for an orbital death laser, and running into a trio of elderly women howling for my blood after I reprogrammed a sexbot to work for the local bar, I found myself thinking, 'This might be one of the best RPGs I've ever played.'  More than any other game in recent memory,  Fallout: New Vegas  is an RPG that encourages - and rewards - you for exploring strange or out-there possibilities. Whether you want to be the savior of the Mojave Wasteland or the Devil Incarnate when it comes to the way you deal with the world and its residents, this game actively relishes in allowing you to mold the experience in any way, shape or form you choose.  As a courier who is double-crossed and shot in the head, the game immediately sets itself apart from previous Fallout titles (which all had you start in a Vault and bring you slowly into the outside world) by having you wake up in a small town and immediately get caught up in a (sometimes-overwhelming) amount of oddball characters, sidequests and machinations from various factions within the Mojave. When you set out, you'll quickly find yourself making enemies, running across all sorts of strange locations and getting lost in a mountain of sidequests that will quickly have you glued to your computer saying 'just one more mission'.  The most interesting aspect of the game is the care that's taken to giving the player unique, memorable experiences. Whether it's strolling into a new town as the sound of Marty Robbins' 'Big Iron' plays on your Pip-Boy radio, the oddball encounters given by the Wild Wasteland perk, the unmarked quests peppered throughout the wasteland or the fact that you can literally run around killing everything and everything (up to and including the heads of major factions), the game has an unbeatable sense of world-building and freedom. You can quite literally massacre everyone and still achieve an ending that's on par (or arguably better) than one of the faction endings.  Much care has also been given to the wide assortment of companions you can recruit throughout the game, which all have weird quirks but provide incredible benefits during combat. They all have their own quirks and unique conversations, strong companion quests, insight into the various factions and amusing chatter during combat and encounters. Likewise, it shows how much care Obsidian Entertainment put into the game when you see some of the minor NPCs, who have surprisingly-intricate conversations and mini-questlines.   New Vegas  also has some of the most interesting and, I would argue, iconic encounters and quest designs in the entire series. Whether it's the surreal 'social experiment' in Vault 22 (and arguably, the rest of the Vaults in the Mojave), menial tasks like the picture-taking sidequest at the south end of the Vegas Strip, or just being able to sell your companion to a group of high-society cannibals for no other reason than 'for the evulz', the game does an incredible job of keeping things fresh and varied throughout a playthrough.  The most interesting thing is that you can play the game a number of different ways and get a different experience every time. The first time I beat the game, I was doing a completionist 'goody-two-shoes' run where I saved everyone I could and was incredibly thorough. When I went back for a second run, I played as a female melee expert who ran around stealth-killing everyone with sneak attacks, but couldn't shoot guns to save her life. The flexibility and care given to making both character builds have unique advantages is the main part of why New Vegas continues to have such replay value.  Of course, there's also the modding community, which has given the game unparalleled longevity, both through restored content (like the  New Vegas Uncut  series on Nexusmods) or major gameplay overhauls like Project Nevada. Even if it wasn't on sale, the game is still incredible value thanks to the amount of content both in the game and contributed by the community.  I highly recommend  New Vegas  for anyone getting into the genre. It's one of my favorite Western RPGs, and an experience that keeps rewarding me time and time again.",

            "review_text": "Obsidian is an amazing company, with a solid background in RPGs and storytelling. Fallout New Vegas is my favorite Fallout game, with Fallout 2 following closely, and is an amazing RPG with great lore building and lore stacking.  Obsidian also knows what the ♥♥♥♥ an RPG actually is, unlike bethesda, and makes great advancements over Fallout 3 and over Fallout 4 as well. The reintroduction of traits, which was short lived as Fallout 4 lost all of its RPG elements, was a great feature to FNV, taking traits from the orginal Fallout games and adding new ones; even going as far as to add even more in the Old World Blues DLC. The perk system is similar to Fallout 2, a perk ever other level rather than one every level; the perks also do what Bethesda perks don't, which is actually behave like perks. By this I mean that the perks in FNV are game changing, perks should make the game play differently rather than just doing more damage or more EX per task. Jury Rigging and Mad Bomber are my favorite perks from FNV, adding new ways to supply yourself with weapons and changing up how the repair system works. There are perks that do add more EX per task like I mentioned, but its signifigance is small compared to how many there are to change combat, crafting, survival and speech options.  LORE, I absolutely LOVE lore. I can't get enough lore out of things I'm into, the Brotherhood of Steel lore especially, I'm a huge BoS fan. Obsidian does this amazing thing, whereas others *cough *cough* bethesda, don't. Surprise! They actually know what the ♥♥♥♥ they're talking about when they write lore. They actually give a damn if the lore can be supported and if it will conflict with other lore. They build onto previous lore and write new lore where its needed. Jacobstown is a HUGE reference to Fallout 1 and 2. The name of Jacobstown itself is a big reference, the super mutants who mention the masters army is a big reference, nightkin is a reference which I thought had been lost in the newer games. Obsidian knows what they're doing with lore much better than the company which prides inself on it's 'storytelling'.  So, Obsidian is a great company who deserves ever dollar they get from you buying this game. They make AMAZING RPGs, they write GREAT lore, and overall they're just good at what they do, and isnt that what it should all be about in the end? Making a great game requires a great company to make it.  P.S. The head honcho of Obsidian is one of the lead directors of Fallout 2, so classic Fallout fans, you can trust him. You also should try out KOTOR 2, or Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic 2, another great Obsidian game.",

The game takes place in the Mojave Wasteland � a pretty much lifeless, HUGE and twice as many locations as F03. It's a bleak world without much hope and the choice is between bad and worse. New Vegas does have a few technical issues. Overall, the game is best played not as a sandbox but as a more traditional RPG where you explore the main quest, which, depending on your choices, will send you to a variety of locations. New Vegas is a huge game. I can probably write another 6 pages examining New Vegas's various aspects but i'd rather play more. This game is only improved upon with the INSANELY TALENTED modding community with some quest mods even better than the ones Obsidian has written themselves dont forget all the armour, weapons, the re-texture's and mods that increase the difficulty of the Mojave.   Without a doubt a MUST OWN! even without mods and any DLC its just so great it would be a crime to not pick this up worth any amount of money.",

            "review_text": "Took me a while to get into but once i did, i loved it.  It's better then Fallout 3, why ? Because it lets you do whatever you please, you can kill everything if you feel like it, even important characters related to the main plot of the game can die and the world will react to it properly with many dialogs with NPCs changing to what you did and some quests might not even be open to you anymore due to what you did.  Quests in New Vegas tend to have alot of multiple choices,solutions and endings, not just one neutral ending,one evil ending and one good ending , instead there's a fine line of varying shades of grey which will often make you think about what you're about to do instead of doing the usual video game trope of 'Well, i wanna be a good guy/a**hole so I'll pick text that's in blue/red'.  This is why people tend to recommend Obsidian's New Vegas over Bethesda's Fallout 3, New Vegas has far more intreasting things to do in it with an insane amount of choices and outcomes which make replaying it a second and even a 3rd time still a somewhat refreshing experience without resorting to installing community made quests via the Nexus mod site.  However, the problem New Vegas still has to this date is the engine it's powered by. Even when it came out back in 2010, the engine it had was considered a fairly limiting and old engine, it can only use 2GB of RAM on a system which is just one of the many reasons why this game loves to crash so much.  It also comes with an annoying micro-stutter bug that's caused by the fact than the engine was for some reason coded for 64 Hz at 64 FPS for some strange reason and since pretty much no one in this world has a TV/Monitor that's 64Hzs, it ends up causing weird micro-stutters in the game. Thankfully the community created various mods which fixed these issues, there's a popular mod which removes the micro-stutters so you can enjoy a a nice smooth 60 (or 120/144 ) FPS experience without any stutters and there's a community made launcher which enables New Vegas to properly use at least 4GB of RAM and not just 2, which is a must if you plan to mod New Vegas with graphical mods that increase texture sizes alot or maybe add alot more models and other things in the world to be loaded by.  Overall, it's an amazing game that's sadly sometimes hampered with technical issues it has due to the engine it uses.",

An almost perfect balance of difficulty, questlining, exploration and cast of colourful characters. An awesome 4 different endings for the final Hoover Dam battle, deciding the ultimate fate of the Mojave forever. Plenty of side and faction quests to keep you occupied for an easy 100+ for completionists.   The factions are very cool, with some very interesting backstories, e.g. how the NCR are the re-construction of the democratic world, or how the Legion are basing themselves on the success of Pre-War Rome. Definitely adds to the throwback of the Pre-War era.  Ok onto the DLC's:  Lonesome Road: Ok Lonesome Road has got to be my favourite DLC by far. The amazing and yet emotional story of the true destruction of human nature, The Divide. The hellish nightmare you'd think most of the Fallout world would truly be. With plenty of secret US Govt. bases and awesome prototype laser weapons including Red Rocket. A heartwarming and cold-blooded ending with the tale encrypted into ED-E, and an epic finale showdown in an OPERATIONAL Nuclear Missile Silo, with the option to change all Faction relations in the Mojave with the option to Nuke NCR or Legion... or BOTH! 10/10 would replay many times!  Old World Blues: This was an interesting DLC. Travelling to an old Pre-War Area51-esque science base called Big MT, having your Spine, Brain and Heart removed for robot parts, and then quest to overthrow the facility and track down your old brain in a very epic confrontation. Definitely will recommend this DLC to anyone. 10/10  Dead Money: Ok, so Dead Money. This DLC has a unique and interesting storyline, of a super luxurious casino opened on the day of the Great War bombings in 2077. Having never opened, and left sealed in a cloud of toxic dust, it has been haunted by the ghosts and holograms left to rot. I liked the story of the Greatest Heist of the Century. Howecer, the downside to this DLC is the unbelievable difficulty. It took me as a Lvl50 character, 9 hours and about 12 deaths later to beat it. Its a good DLC, but needs to be nerfed in Difficulty ALOT! 6/10  Honest Hearts: Honest Hearts was the kind of DLC made specifically for the more strategic and cartegoraphical advanced player. Not an easy terrain to navigate in the Utah badlands, but a very cool Native American-esque story with many tribes scared of Pre-War structures, living the old native way, under threat for warmonger tribe White Legs. And a heartwarming story to decide the fate to Fight or Run to save the Sorrows and Dead Horses. And a very confronting meet with The Burned Man himself.... 9/10",

            "review_text": "Have you ever been a long-time fan of something, gotten really excited when you heard it was coming back, only to be massively disappointed with the result? Fallout 3 had this effect on many fans of the Fallout series, myself included. Thankfully Fallout: New Vegas was developed under Obsidian Entertainment, a smaller company known mainly for Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II. The project leader was Joshua Sawyer, the same person in charge of the original Fallout 3 that was cancelled after financial troubles with the developer’s parent company. Fallout: New Vegas serves as a “return to form” for the Fallout series, bring it back to its roots in exploring the ethics of a post-apocalyptic world, not exploring the world itself.  Returning to Western USA, New Vegas is set in the Mojave Wasteland, directly adapted from the real world Mojave desert. Being a western the art direction of the game has changed from Fallout 3 but it should look familiar. The horrible green tint has been replaced by a much more subtle (yet still a bit annoying) orange tint, Buildings a much more suited to the environment (with much more varied interiors) and a good portion of the game world is actual desert. Despite being set on a desert, the sheer amount of content in New Vegas is densely packed in a logically designed world that is easy to navigate without a map, thanks to cleverly located landmarks. Gone are the days of trying to distinguish between this pile and rubble and that pile of rubble. The Mojave also features a number of areas that are very dangerous to lower level players, while level scaling does exist, it only ensures that enemies aren’t just cannon fodder at later levels.  Moving from Fallout 3 to New Vegas won’t feel too different gameplay wise. While the two are very similar, New Vegas is improved in every way. Iron sights have been added to make first person shooting a viable tactic, VATS has been reworked to be less unfair for enemies, Guns skill no longer increases bullet damage, etc. Character creation has had a few smaller changes but the ways your point allocation works in the world has been greatly improved. Perks are only gained once per two levels making you still human by level 30. Traits make a welcome comeback from Fallout and Fallout 2 where you can choose a nice little perk but at the cost of something else. Fallout: New Vegas allows great flexibility in what kind of character you want to play as, and all character build are perfectly viable. Want to be a gunslinger who kills and instils fear in all who oppose him? Go Ahead. Want to be a pacifist? Using your words to solve issues? Sure, New Vegas allows you to. Being able to shape the game, rather than just play it, is what makes Fallout: New Vegas stand out among modern RPGs. It’s surprising how not many Role Playing Games actually let you Role Play. While at launch the game was buggy beyond being playable, the game has been shaped by developers post launch to be the most stable Gamebryo game in existence, not a hard title to achieve but a good one nonetheless.  You play as “The Courier” and while delivering a small package to the New Vegas Strip, you are ambushed and end up in a shallow grave. Miraculously you survive the encounter and begin your quest to retrieve the mysterious package. A common misconception with Act I of the story is that it's just a western tale of revenge. The reality is that the story is about the package you were meant to deliver and using it to determine the fate of the Mojave Wasteland and its inhabitants.  The two main factions, the New California Republic and Caesar’s Legion are battling for control of Hoover dam and the conflict between the two is apparent throughout the whole game, and by the time you finish Act I you should be near a decision on who you want to side with, or if you want to side with one of them at all. Unlike Fallout 3, New Vegas is not a simple tale of White Knights vs Evil Moustache twirling cartoon characters and many of the game’s decisions are morally ambiguous as opposed to black and white choices. Because the game predominantly features factions with unique motives, it makes sense to reintroduce the Faction Reputation System, as opposed to relying on a heavily flawed Karma System. Players can complete quests in a variety of different ways, and in favour of different people. Whether it be through distribution of electricity, or destroying the NCRs monorail; the variety of ways to play the game makes it unrivalled in terms of replayability.  Interacting with the seemingly infinite number of NPCs is a joy. Dialogue is excellently written and everyone has lots to say. The Skill checks the feature are well varied in the skills they use and expertly written to be believable. “Your predisposition towards anger suggests unresolved issues in your past” sounds like a credible thing someone trained in Medicine would say. While the number of voice actors is only a small improvement over Fallout 3, the quality of the voice acting is a massive improvement, characters personalities are greatly enhanced by the brilliant voice work done. Facial animation still leaves a lot to be desired but it’s still an improvement.   Because Obsidian Entertainment consists of many ex-Black Isle employees, including the series creator Tim Cain, New Vegas is very faithful to the canon established by the first two games. The game also plays a lot like a first person version of the old-school RPGs. A lot of NPC interaction is involved making the game more about interacting with the world than exploring it.  Fallout: New Vegas does well to capture the atmosphere of Fallout, a world rebuilding after a nuclear holocaust. Adding to this is the soundtrack, which is largely comprised of the atmospheric music from the first two games. While it’s disappointing that very little new score was composed for New Vegas, it’s still infinitely better than the action movie soundtrack of Fallout 3. Radio stations make a return and play music appropriate for the retro future setting. Though this time with radio hosts that actually make sense in the world of Fallout.  If you enjoy RPG experiences with deep lore, plenty of replayability then Fallout: New Vegas is for you. If you just want a simple minded shoot and loot then it may not be for you, but I still highly recommend it. It does a fantastic job of bringing Fallout back to being… Fallout.",

I may get some hate for this, but in my opinion, Fallout New Vegas has out done Fallout 3 in nearly every regard. The story is pretty great. It can be slow at times, but when you make decisions, they feel like they actually matter. The setting is something many people used to praise Fallout 3 for, including myself, and it is no doubt one of the best game settings ever, but after several play throughs of New Vegas, I feel the Mojave has that extra bit of charm that the DC wasteland didnt have. Some disliked the Mojaves bright skie's and bright City for a post apocalyptic game, but for me it just felt very right. The writing for some of the Side Quests in this game, is truly phenominal, and I hope Obsidian gets another shot at a Fallout game once Fallout 4 is out. Overall Fallout New vegas, and the Fallout franchise as a whole is a master piece, with rich and interesting Lore, great characters, excellent gameplay, and HOURS of replayability. Expect 100+ hours per playthrough, and even then you'll still have not done everything. My playtime on steam for this is only about 128 hours as of 2/14/16, but when I used to play this on console, id say my time on it is around 600+.  **EDIT: Having now played Fallout 4 and its overly simplified rpg elements, i've come to appreciate this game even more than when i originally wrote this.    Here is a summed up list of the Pro's and Con's of Fallout: New Vegas    PRO's  -Amazing and vast, variety of weapons.  -Interesting and Fun characters.  -Extensive character customization.  -Great leveling system with awesome Perks.  -Excellent setting.  -Good story, and great variety of story paths and Choice's.  -V.A.T.S  -The Pip Boy 3 thousand, Enough said.  -DLC's add a good amount of content for your character to take back to the Mojave. The way the DLC story lines tie in with the main games narrative is ♥♥♥♥ing excellent, making this games DLC some of the best i've ever played.  -Very well optimized for the PC. Runs better on my fairly average computer than it did on my Xbox 360.    CON'S   -Occasional crashes, not as big a deal as people make it out to be. You should be fine unless your trying to run this on an Etch A Sketch or a Potato.  -Sometime's a glitch will interfere with a quest or you might get stuck in a ledge. This is also Very occasional and not a real problem at all.    If you dont already own Fallout New Vegas, why are you still reading this, go buy it. NOW!.  10/10, Would herd Wind Brahmin Again.",

            "review_text": "I recently played a game titled, Fallout: New Vegas, it was developed by Obsidian Studios, which many of the company’s members happen to be former members of Interplay Productions’ Black Isle Studios, the ones who brought you Fallout 1, Fallout 2, Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel, and Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel. The game was published by Bethesda Softworks, the Makers of Fallout 3, as well as one of my other favorite game series, The Elder Scrolls.  The game takes place in The Mojave Wasteland, which is the Post Apocalyptic version of the areas of Nevada, California, and Arizona. The game follows a The Courier who has a package delivery go wrong, as you find out at the very start of the game. This is one of the few games that I recommend watching the intro all the way through on, as the intro is very well done, in fact I enjoyed watching it my first playthrough, and then after I had played the game through several times, after which I noticed many different things that you would only notice after having played the game in depth.   The game is played in 1st/3rd person perspective, and the player interacts with the world and with items using a GUI called a Pipboy 3000, which can be upgraded to the Pimpboy 3 Billion (Which is a gold plated version of the Pipboy 3000.) after completing a certain quest. The game has a nicely done crafting system for creating items for the player to use/sell. You can make items from a few different hotspots, those would be, a fireplace or hot plate, a workbench as well as a repair bench.   This game unlike so many of its kind, actually has a nonlinear questline, which basically means you can chose who you would like to side with, as well as how you want to handle a situation in most cases.   The games main factions that you can side with during the main questline are Caesar’s Legion, Mr. House, the New California Republic (NCR), and for an independent New Vegas, you can side with a overly friendly and forthcoming robot named Yes Man.   Caesar’s Legion is led by no other than Caesar, aka Edward Sallow, Caesar co-founded his legion with a man known as Joshua Graham, whos name is not to be spoken within The Legion without punishment.   Mr. House or Robert House, founder of RobCo Industries, is a man who spent the latter years of his Pre-War life, planning for how to keep himself alive indefinitely, and protect the Vegas Strip from nuclear attacks.  The New California Republic is a fairly large democratic federation that is the absolute enemy of Caesar’s Legion.  The music choices in Fallout: New Vegas are fantastic, it perfectly fits in with the early 1900’s feel of the game and while a few may disagree the music itself is very good, with selections of the greats of the 1940s and 1950s with genres including classical and jazz. I feel like this revived a great period of time for music, so that new generations could enjoy it for themselves. This game is amazing and I would recommend it as a must play for gamers everywhere.",

Main story falls short in comparison to FO3: NV it's mostly made of side quests - some of which very interesting, I have to admit - but all the Courier's story starts and ends in a flutter (not going to spoil).  ● I loved FO3 dark setting, I liked New Vegas. ● I loved FO3 story, I liked New Vegas. ● I had some crashes in FO3, I had many more in New Vegas. ● I don't remember any particular bug in FO3, I found a lot in New Vegas - from mid game to end I had to open the wiki almost every time I played. ● I had to fast travel very often in NV because of silly quest while I spent more time actually playing in FO3. ● Factions implementation is not good in New Vegas, in my opinion: if you don't pay attention to what armor you wear, your playthrough can get f****d up.  As you can see, there's a lot of things I didn't like, BUT I cannot say New Vegas is a bad game; I can just tell to whoever is still doubtful about choosing Fallout 3 or New Vegas, go with the former, you won't be disappointed.",

I have explored every possible element, looted every corpse, cabinet and dead Brahmin that I could find; there is SO much content, and with 3 DLCs, you have plenty to work with.  Some of the voice acting gets a little...groovy within dialogue, corpses fly to the ceiling with V.A.Ts shots, rescuing followers from behind boulders becomes a frequent chore, and if I have to listen to one more run of Johnny Guitar, I may scream...but a solid 10/10 overall from me.

The down side is, this ancient title that was dug up from the tombs of Bethesda way back in the fantastic year 2012 still somehow managed to be a better game. Which is upsetting to me in a lot of ways, but this game is truly a fantastic RPG in almost every regard of the word. It's not a simple Yes simulator like Fallout 4 is. I feel connected to my character in this game, I feel like I can really play someone give them a backstory, a life and a reason to keep pushing through the mutant rampant lands that we call the Mohave.   Is it perfect gameplay? No. But mods fix that. And moding is 100% free (as long as you aren’t playing on a toaster). The melee system is clunky no matter what, the gun play is fun and you can mod weapons, it's very limited yes. But it's not overwhelming and you don’t have to lug around the entirety of a hoarders belongings in order to make sure you can upgrade your pipe pistol from the start of the game to still be relevant.   I love this game, I played it for hours back when I still had a functional PS3 and I'm probably going to play it for way more then what I have right now.

            "review_text": "TL;DR - Just by sheer length, you should be able to realize that I would recommend this game to everyone. This review is about WHY I recommend it so highly. I do not use the word 'awesome' very often, but to say “New Vegas's writing and characters are awesome” is true. And I mean, they can create a feeling of awe in YOU. It is especially obvious in the companions that join YOU during YOUR game.  SPOILER WARNINGS FOR FALLOUT 1, FALLOUT 2, FALLOUT 3, AND FALLOUT: NEW VEGAS ULTIMATE EDITION!  It's easy to see why Boone is a great character. Or how much of a story you can actually give an eyebot. You should sympathize/empathize with Veronica, while being frustrated and understanding at the same time with what Christine had to do. Getting to choose which brain gets to be Rex's replacement, and finding him a mate in Roxie. Being able to help the Nightkin with a high enough science skill and Lily. Getting Dean and Dog/God to begin again. Helping Arcade and Raul choose their own future path in helping the wasteland. Aiding Follows-Chalk in deciding if exploring the 'civilized world' is worth the time. Helping Waking Cloud with her family and uncovering the mysteries of her tribe's past.  They are all interesting characters, because of their abilities to help you, and because they all have different stories. But Cass's story is different, even though it does not seem different. You find her drinking alone on the edge of New Vegas. Trapped between going home and trying to uncover the problems of her caravan business. You can help her several different ways. First you can convince her to go back home and not 'sellout', or 'sellout' in order to uncover what happened. And you help her choose how to deal with the assassinations, whether to take them to court and hurt them in their pocketbooks(the reason they did the assassinations in the first place) or deal in 'An eye for an eye' justice, and kill them all. Regardless of your choice, she is never mad at you for helping. But you literally help decide what kind of person she will become. Now this might not seem very special. You are right, when only taken as the story from Fallout: New Vegas, her companion story lands somewhere in the middle to upper range.  But Fallout: New Vegas is not the start of the series. And Obsidian had members that worked on Fallout 2(most importantly Chris Avellone, since he is also the writer of Cass and the Mohave Outpost where you find her, and he created Vault City – more on this later), and are close friends with the people that made Fallout 1. So it was not difficult for them to understand the entire narrative and expand upon what has already happened.  To really appreciate Cass's complete story, you have to go back to the start of the series and understand your role in the Fallout universe. In Fallout 1(1997 in our world), the Overseer of Vault 13, sends&nbsp;YOU('The Vault Dweller') outside of Vault 13 in order to find a replacement for their failing water filtration system. The solutions to YOUR Vault's water problems cause the otherwise secret location of YOUR Vault to become known. The Overseer is angry that YOU have endangered Vault 13, so he sends YOU back out to save the Vault from YOUR mess. Once YOU are finally done ensuring the safety of Vault 13, YOU return home. The Overseer recognizes that YOU are no longer a Vault 13 citizen, YOUR travels have changed the person that YOU once were. He feels that YOU would be a danger to Vault 13's society. So after all YOUR hard work, YOU get exiled from YOUR home.  Some of the other members of Vault 13 are angry at the Overseer for the choice to exile “The Vault Dweller”, and they all join 'The Vault Dweller'. They travel for a bit and eventually create the village of Arroyo. 'The Vault Dweller' gets married and has a daughter. This daughter becomes the leader of the tribe. A generation almost completely passes before Arroyo falls onto hard times. They need a technological boost to survive.  Fallout 2(1998) opens with 'The Vault Dweller''s daughter(the leader of the Arroyo tribe) explaining to YOU, her child('The Chosen One'), to leave YOUR tribe to find the required technology to help save everyone. Along the way YOU stop in Vault City. In the outskirts of town there is a bar. The owner of the bar is John Cassidy. YOU help him with his unfair debts. He wants to escape from Vault City now that he does not owe money and joins up with YOU. There is not much else to say. For the next 12 years(in our time) there is not much to talk about. John Cassidy was a popular choice to bring in YOUR party. He had a bad heart so YOU could store YOUR drugs with him without fear of him ever using anything but stimpack, but the man loves to drink. YOU can ask him what weapons he is good with. He tells YOU that he is mostly good with guns and knives, but is ashamed to tell YOU that he can use a spear(since it might make people think that his is just a tribal). The main character development seemed to be explaining to him that YOU are just a tribal, and he has learned his lesson about being judgmental of tribals.  So why was all that back story about the stories of Fallout 1 and 2 important? And why did I capitalize all the 'you's and 'your's when talking about the Player Characters? I capitalized them to remind you that it was your choice for these things to happen. These are the canonical events. Even though you do not have to recruit John Cassidy, the official story states that you did.  So jumping ahead to Fallout 3(2008). It is based on the opposite coast from the rest of the series, and barely tells us anything about what happened in Fallout 1/Fallout 2, like Fallout 2 did with Fallout 1. That is all that needs to be said about Fallout 3.  Back to Fallout: New Vegas(2010). If you do not send Cass back West, she joins YOU. When YOU ask her about her name YOU learn it is Rose of Sharon Cassidy. Cass for short. YOU learn that she can use guns, knives, and spears. She gets annoyed with YOU, if you talk to her while high on any drugs, but gives you bonus for drinking alcohol. Especially her favorite kind, Whiskey, which gives YOU another bonus. When YOU ask more about her life growing up, YOU learn that her mother was sick and did not raise her much. Her dad just left one day, when she was young. All of the evidence should show that Cass is the daughter of John Cassidy. YOU!!!!!!!('The Chosen One' from Fallout 2) are the reason why John Cassidy leaves Vault City and Cass. YOU are the reason Cass's life has turned out this way. YOU are the cause of all her problems, just because YOU wanted a party member that was really good with a gun.  The developers are the reason why Boone had a such a rough life. The developers are the reason why Christine was so obsessed with being in the 'Circle of Steel' and solving the internal problems of the 'Brotherhood of Steel'. Even at the cost of her voice and her relationship with Veronica. The developers are the reason that ED-E is broken and that Rex is dying. The developers are the reason that Raul is locked up, or that Arcade has run from his past. The developers are the reason that Lily is going crazy and Dog/God's personality is split. The developers are the reason that Dean got caught up in the Sierra Madre. The developers are why Follows-Chalk and Waking Cloud are struggling with different aspects of tribal life.  Sure, Josh Sawyer told Chris Avellone to do something with John Cassidy when the game was being developed. It is not completely YOUR fault. But you actually caused Cass to turn out this way. If YOU did not find John Cassidy's character to be useful, then Josh would never have told Chris to use that storyline from Fallout 2.  YOU now recruit John Cassidy because if you don't, he doesn't help save the world, but still leaves his daughter and wife. Now this is the part of his story that YOU get to shape.  Cass is one of the many examples of why I recommend this game to everyone.",

            "review_text": "Before you read this review - let me just say this: buy it. Just buy it.  Fallout New Vegas is a FPS/3rd-person/RPG/adventure game hybrid that for most gamers it would be common to compare with Skyrim. Because after all, the two games were developed by the same company. Almost. Bethesda and Obsidian respectively Based upon an equal foundation, at least. But New Vegas is so much more than Skyrim in a post-apocalypse setting.  New Vegas shows some of the most intriguing, creative, funny and emotional writing that I've ever experienced in a game. It sets the perfect tone with the western post apocalyptic 1960's combined with a bunch of Vegas Baby-backdrop for an adventure about war, ruthless criminals, survival, and endless discoveries.   It encourages an alternative approach with a seriously dialogue-driven storyline. With you as a participant, you can influence almost everything that happens. IF you're a charismatic speaker. If not...well, I guess you could go for the (ATTACK) option.  This bothers me much with other games, because there's usually no 'pacifist' game mechanic, you usually end up straining yourself to avoid things the game want you to do, because it doesnt tailor to what you want for yourself. This is not the case with New Vegas. If you want this or that to be the fallout (meh) of your several quest and individual storylines, it's fine. It's possible.   The combat may feel a bit disjointed and 'hack'n'slash'-like, with little weight behind motions. I would like more impact. There's not really much physics involved, except for the ragdolls when someone dies, lol. Even that is lackluster.  Graphics... pretty..bland. At least my vanilla game (the normal, not modded version) doesn't really drag me into an immersive world, and it hasn't aged that well. BY ITSELF. Not anymore. that's my curse though, I'm a bit stuck up when it comes to graphics and visuals. I just didn't manage to get AS into it as I used to. Then I started modding, and got ENBs functional. My Fallout now looks incredible, runs good, and for me is one of the most complete experiences to date.   When I get past my own cursed liking for good visuals, and actually got the game looking sweet... There's nothing bothering me with this game. The writing and story, the characters, locations, the exploration, the factions you fight for and against, the dynamic and deep companions, the action and reaction, consequences of your choices, and how it's all just... Its a good trip.  One of my favorite games. No doubt. about 40 hours checked on this playthrough, and I haven't even reached the Strip! A couple of years ago I got 100+ hours without a hitch.

NV also makes for a good follow up to Fallout 3, as they are build off the same engine and for the most part have very similar play style. On top of that they reworked combat outside of VATS to make if feel more fluid with the ability to actually shoot down your sights even at low level over FO3.   Another improvement was to repairs for weapons were now you can fix a gun to max condition even with low repair vs FO3 not letting you do that. Lastly the change to companions and making them more useful over FO3 is great. I liked having companions to help out and all of them have missions and stories their own that add even more to narrative of the world you play in.  New Vegas does come with a little baggage (Few bugs/CTD) but other then that, as long you have auto save on your ok. The only thing that puts me off little on this game is it don't really have the apocalypse feel as much as FO3 does. I'm ok with the more old western feel but I do miss the large destroyed city feel most of FO3 had. Mods also can help add to your world, change whatever you want. You choose how things turn out but as always, war… war never changes. ***9.5/10***",

Now, although I will admit I have never played the original Fallout 1 and 2, I do know a fair bit, and really am looking forward to playing them, and from what I know, if you want to continue off from where Fallout 2 ended, or just want to get into more of a lore feel, this game is for you, not putting down Fallout 3, but it wasn't near the location of fallout 2, making it a lot harder to continue on the growing factions and people like Fallout New Vegas did. But if you're just here for fun, add mods and it can double the fun a lot of the times.   There are some downsides to this game however. There are some technical issues, stutter, crashing and etc, but when looking past all these, its a damn fine game. However this is just my oppinion.",

Of course it's not recommended to kill everyone you meet, but the fact that you have that choice makes this game feel more like what an open world RPG should be. I also love that killing is not the only option of getting quests done. As you level up you can increase your various skills. some skills such as speech and bartering can be used in conversations with NPCs. With a high enough speech skill you can persuade people to see things your way, instead of having to put a bullet in their head. Of course this doesn't apply to every person you meet who is shooting at you.

Turn on true iron sights, install a few mods in the standard practice for Bethesda-engine games, and save often. I'll include a list of my choice mods at the end of the review.  Do save often. Bethesda-engine games are notoriously unstable, and this (built on Oblivion's engine) is no exception!  However, the game has good writing, plays fluidly, and delivers an enjoyably varied experience - especially if you play throught he DLC as well. Highly recommended for fans of Fallout who are not purists at heart (the series has diverged from its isometric RPG roots).  I recommend the following mods:  - Underwater Vault Home New Vegas edition (UMHNV) or Afterschool Special  These are housing mods with a quest to earn their housing. UWHNV requires NVSE (New Vegas Script Extender) and Afterschool special does not. NVSE is worth installing - there are other mods that use it, and it's an invisible modification. (I use the last Beta version, 4.X something and it works well.) UWHNV basically allows you to move the entrance of the home wherever you like and includes a beautiful sorting and display mechanism. Afterschool Special allows you to take over and convert the school in the first town to a home that is simple, compact and effective as well as pretty.  - RHK Companion Cure  Corrects an oversight in Bethesda/Obsidian's companion mechanism, allows you to cure posion in your companions, which is much better than the base mechanics.  - Perk Every Level and Unlimited Traits  This shifts balance somewhat, allowing the player to build as many of the game's provided traits as desired during character creation. (All of them are tradeoffs of one sort or another.) In my case, I didn't want to forego Weird Wasteland because I chose traits that suited my vision of your character. Perk Every Level will build a more powerful character, but also free you from some of the tyrrany of having too many good options or having to ruthlessly specialize into one playstyle.  - DLC: Old World Blues is the best of the set, followed by DLC: Lonesome Road.   The others are certainly not bad, but do not live up to these two. If you get the GOTY edition, you'll get them all, but if you're forced to choose, go with these.  - Other mods, like texture and model replacers to taste.  What you like will vary. I recommend installing the Nexus Mod Manager, and using it to manage your mods as painlessly as possible (everything except NVSE which must be manually installed).  Get it. Get it now. Enjoy it.",

            "review_text": "After the wide critical acclaim and finacial success of Bethesda's Fallout 3, it was only a matter of time before a follow up was to be produced. This follow up developed by Obsidian Entertainement would not only meet fan expectations across the board but raise the bar of quality and world building for Western RPG's as a genre.   What makes New Vegas a great game compared to it's contempararies is the level of depth and thoughtfulness when it came to presenting it's setting. The people, towns, and factions are all handled incredibly realistically, to the extent where each settlement has it's own food source and way of income. Comparitively in Fallout 3, such details are completely glossed over, leaving some very impractical settlements scattered about the wasteland.   Since this game uses the same engine as Fallout 3, Obsidian had the luxury of improving where they Bethesda left off. As a result, players have the ability to aim down the sight of their weapons, switch between different ammo types, weapon modding, companion quests/companion perks, and a hardcore mode which offers even more gameplay mechanics to the mix.   Personally, I'd say my favorite aspect of New Vegas is the thriving mod community that continues to still produce more content on already 100 + hour experience.  If you're into games that present world worth engaging yourself in as well a wealth of opportunities for player expression, then New Vegas is definitely worth the purchase. Easily one of the best games of last generation.",

I am so enamored by this game i am going to write a full review  FYI, I have not beat the game, or havnt even really touched most of the places or characters or quests. But after 25 hours with so much to do, I feel I can accuratly review the game.  Overall Impressions:  If you don't want to read a very detailed review of the game, just read this. If you want a detailed review (although u shouldnt be reading reviews and be clicking that buy now button) scroll down a bit.   First off, I have not played FO3, so I have no way to compair weather its a better game than that or not. I had heard about fallout and the mascot for me was easily recognizeable when it came out, but I never had much of an intrest in the game or rpgs. Fallout:NV came out and when my friend got it for Xbox 360, I watched some and it looked interesting, but i was into other games and didnt want to play it. last christmas, while it was on sale, I purchased skyrim, my first rpg taste. Now I realize skyrim isnt as much of an rpg as FO but it got my feet wet, and I loved the setting, being an insanly big Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones fan. However, i LOVE EFFING SKYRIM TO DEATH. That made me go wow! I bet Fallout is awesome if Skyrim is this good! So i saw it on sale over haloween and i picked it up along with the witcher, payday 2, dmc4. I played mostly pd2 and dmc and witcher and kinda forgot about FO:NV. However, when I did, I wasnt just hooked like i was 2 skyrim. This became the most fun, and overall meaningful game to my playing to date. All of the options are great, there are a lot of different factions all fighting and weaving in and out and picking some sids but not others is fun and challanging. I havn't touched hardcore mode yet but I bet its fun, I just want to focus on enjoying the game right now before I go shoot myself haha! Anways this game is amazing and a MUST OWN. Now onto specifics  Gameplay: +Many weapons +GORE +V.A.T.S. system is a great and not overpowered. -spriting  The gameplay itself is good, it feels good to shoot and the slight waver in your hand adds to the realism and I personally liked the added challenge. However, not being able to sprint, while not bad, can be annoying as I wish I could rush from cover to cover. I give gameplay 9/10  Visuals: +Has moments of beauty +Destroyed wasteland is great and it all affects the mood of the game -runs on old engin so graphics look mostly outdated -character models look a bit stiff to me  This game is 4-5 years old and still looks good! However, it does look outdated and abovementioned stuff 7.5/10  Story: +SO Many options +tons and tons of ways to progress  To me the story so far is great. Every faction is interesting and your personal story is very cool. The sidemissions IMO are better than main ones, but the main missions are great so thats saying something. 9.5/10  Final verdict:  9.5/10  This is my favorite game of all time. That doesnt mean its a perfect 10. It has a lot of bugs and outdated models, but the game itself is what keeps me going. Anyway thanks for reading!

Whilst most of the map is a barren landscape, New Vegas is FULL of hiden quests, items, easter eggs and just swarming with things to do.  Whilst it doesn't add much new to the Fallout series, in no means does it feel like a Fallout 3 copy. The story is great, full of twists and turns and most importatnly, player options. You get to choose how you want the grand finale to go, wheter it's the easiest way or the hardest. After you complete the main Act's, you still have a ton of places to explore, quests to solve, and DLC to download!  My only problem with this game, is linked quests. For example, to progress one Main Act quest, you must complete either a very long side quest, or various little side quests that usually offer no impact on the player or story. This is not a fun way to play, and it feels like the game is forcing these quests on me, rather than letting me have the freedom of choice, like the title the game holds dear to its self.  + Story is very interesting, player involvement heavily influences it + Hundreds of hours of content, including 6 DLC expansions + You really feel as if you make in impact in the game universe + The Wild Wasteland perk.

Here, I'll show you what I mean with a few details: -Weapon variety in NV creates a colorful arsenal of bone-breaking, limb-dismembering and outright destructive tools of anarchy. Fallout 4's customization dosent even come close to NV's variety. -Karma actually matters in this game. Certain factions will hate and love you for your actions. And in turn you will be rewarded gracefully or hunted down ruthlessly. And at anytime your reputation can be destroyed and never be recovered.  -This game is an RPG, not a shooter with RPG elements like Fallout 4. -The companion's can be interacted with better in this game. Fallout 4 and it's bland conversation interface left something to be desired, even if those companions may be more fleshed out. Not to mention you can have 2 companions at once in NV with certain combinations. -Johnny Guitar. -Who needs bobbleheads when you have snowglobes depicting Vault Boy in landmarks across the Mojave? Not enough, you say? These snowglobes can be turned in for caps and then placed in a certain player home. -I don't care what others think, but Mr. New Vegas is far better than Travis Miles and Three Dog. -'Truth is, the game was rigged from the start' -'Don't you laugh at me! I know a spell that'll show your true form. Heheh; cave rat taught it to me' -Caravan is almost as addicting as Gwent from The Witcher. -'When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip, the big iron on his hip' -Theres a band of insane, sports equipment wearing slavers that follow the rules of the Roman empire centuries after it's fall that ♥♥♥♥, mount mongrels and each other, huff powder and eat roots, crucify people, hold lotteries and follow a crazy old man with terminal cancer; And you can join them. -'You dig us, baby. We're the Tops' -No settlements. Preston, keep your Minutemen away from the Mojave Wasteland, please. And that's about it. If you feel like playing a Fallout game, you can skip Fallout 3 and come back to it later, outright ignore Fallout 4 and just play New Vegas. Enjoy Your Stay.",

Though not made by the same team that made Fallout 3, not only does it have the same mechanics (with a few extra ones added such as 'Hardcore mode'.) it really does offer more. For example, there are more requests, perks, weapons in it as well as the ability to customize your weapons.  The quests (including DLCs) are much better, in my opinion. In Fallout 3 there is really only 3 different endings but they are more or less the same. The DLCs weren't bad but it did feel repeative and more of a shooter than RGP. In NV, it offers different quest lines for different factions in the story thus giving us a greater depth to the story and it really does feel like your actions do determin the outcome of the Mojave.  The only problems I find with this game is, that is sometimes crashes and gives my PC the Blue screen of death every hour and then. Most of the glitches are patched but it can become a pest. Also, Cazadores are complete c*nts. No matter what level you are, or what weapon you have, they always seem to wipe you out without a problem. And they always come in swarms which becomes impossible to fight unless you have Mini nuke to Shoah the scum.  Overall, 9/10 game. Must get!",

The combat system is very rewarding and make for an interesting change of pace from most shooting games.

This has given me hours of enjoyment and equal amounts of horror at the stories of the wasteland. Also, you can still drink dirty water and do drugs that you find on the floor.",

I still prefer F3 to F:NV but the difference is negligable - Perhaps it is the Factions war that links a lot of the stories together; a handy device that unfortunately makes many experiences seem contrived. The freedom to explore a virtual frontier makes up for being given the duty of running errands for crazed militarists. F3 and F:NV have taken the 'crappy gun makes for more fun' formula to the next level but this leads to micromanagement and an overextended lesson in economics. There are cool guns out there but they are often hard to find and risky to get ('Vengance' for example).

            "review_text": "Bethesda Softworks' release of Fallout 3 in 2008 went a long way in reviving a series which looked to have been milked for all it was worth, and brought a new set of fans for the series. Yet, while the new fans were being entertained by Fallout 3, some of the older fanbase – including myself – bemoaned the game for its poor story and dialogue, the liberties taken with the canon, and the disappointing ending. When the development of Fallout: New Vegas was announced, I must admit that I felt a bit of trepidation. Obsidian Entertaiment was composed of members of the Fallout development team when Black Isle was at its prime, but were they the right people to take up the mantle of a new Fallout game?  In the development of Fallout: New Vegas, Obsidian drew in elements from the incomplete game which was to have been the third instalment of the main series, Van Buren, with various changes to their implementation to deal with the smaller geographical area. Gameplay-wise, though, Fallout: New Vegas strongly resembles Fallout 3, and could be best described as a refined variant of the first/third-person action role-playing action that distinguished Fallout 3 from its predecessors in the series. The skill set has been cleaned up somewhat, removing the Small Guns and Big Guns categories, and placing their weapons into the Guns and Explosives skills accordingly. The new Survival skill ties into the expanded crafting mechanics, and is of particular concern to the new Hardcore mode, in which the character must eat, sleep and drink, in which ammunition has weight as in the original Fallout games, and in which healing takes place over time, rather than being instantaneous.  In an increased attempt to make non-weapon skills useful, the crafting mechanic has been expanded to include the ability to hand-load ammunition using shell casings, powder and lead at a reloading bench, along with cooking and the production of poisons at a campfire. The reloading mechanic is particularly welcome, allowing for the recycling of excess stockpiled ammunition, as well as the casting of rare ammunition types, including certain enhanced ammunition exclusive to the reloading bench. Meanwhile, the cooking mechanic gives a new use to those boxes of Cram which seem to be littered around the wasteland, allowing a skilled player to produce food which can heal more effectively and, in Hardcore Mode, which satiates the character's hunger for longer.  Another new addition to the series is the “true ironsights” configurable option, which ties into a general tightening-up of the shooting mechanics. VATS has been weakened from Fallout 3, and in its place, the shooting mechanics feel somewhat more satisfying, at least at long range, where long rifles feel a bit more useful than they did in Fallout 3. Indeed, weapons under the Guns skill feel a lot more capable of getting one to the end of the game than in Fallout 3, and it is perfectly possible for somebody to focus on one weapon skill – apart from possibly Explosives - and to have few problems proceeding onwards.  The biggest way in which Fallout: New Vegas is distinct to its immediate predecessor is that it feels like a character- and dialogue-oriented game, rather than the exploration-oriented approach of Fallout 3. One of my biggest disappointments with Fallout 3 was its rather poor storyline, in which one felt railroaded into a set of actions, even when they didn't make logical sense for your character, and which worked to the detriment of the rest of the game. Fallout: New Vegas, on the other hand, allows for a greater amount of flexibility with the storyline, with four distinct paths for one to set on, a lot of choices to make in the wasteland, and far more logical consistency than Fallout 3. This does come at a cost, as the start of the game is very linear in terms of exploration, with powerful creatures making progression directly towards New Vegas difficult, but as this approach was taken – albeit more subtly – in both Fallout and Fallout 2, so this will only be a big concern to the players who enjoyed Fallout 3 primarily because of the exploration elements.  Another area which Fallout: New Vegas improves on is the portrayal of its characters. Unlike Fallout 3, in which most of the main characters felt bland or clichéd, Fallout: New Vegas takes more care with several of its characters, giving them a bit more life beyond being simple quest markers. This is of particular note when it comes to the leaders of each faction, and also with the companion characters, all of which possess a well-crafted backstory and a personal quest which progresses their characterisation further. This makes a good comparison to the pack mule approach taken by Fallout 3, and even, to a lesser extent, by Fallout and Fallout 2.  A welcome change to the dynamic of the game is the lessened importance of the karma meter, displaced by the Fallout 2 approach of community reputations, which has been expanded to allow for a broader variety of different reputations. A greater logical consistency is created with NPC reactions, something which felt lacking in Fallout 3. What's more, this allows for a bit more moral ambiguity within the game universe, a far cry from the rather binary set of moral interactions which resulted from Fallout 3's reliance on the karma meter.  Aesthetically, Fallout: New Vegas is not particularly impressive. Fallout 3, also built on the Gamebryo engine, was not particularly impressive. Fallout 3, also built on the Gamebryo engine, was not particularly graphically impressive when it made its appearance in 2008. With no significant improvements to graphics, Fallout: New Vegas looks mediocre, particularly in the wake of extremely GPU-intensive but especially flashy game engines for the PC in the interim. Sounds are effective, but not particularly striking, and simply serve their purpose without going beyond the call of duty.  Inon Zur's backing music from Fallout 3 returns, with a few extra tracks added to the mix. Again, I'd argue that this music is just there to create the right sense of ambience, and rarely goes beyond that purpose. Some Fallout and Fallout 2 players will note the return of some of the music of Mark Morgan from these games, but again, this music always seemed to just serve a purpose with the exception of a few tracks which didn't make it into Fallout: New Vegas.  As with Fallout 3, a healthy number of licensed tracks make their way into the game via the Pip-Boy 3000's radio. Some players may prefer this music to the standard soundtrack, while others may tire quickly of the repetition of the small library of tracks, but it's nice to see the option retained. The music also creates the ambience of civilisation within communities, so in that sense, it's still worth having within the game.  Unfortunately, there is one very negative area in which Fallout: New Vegas has followed in the footsteps of its predecessors. Fallout: New Vegas is still not entirely free of bugs, with graphical glitches and clipping issues still remaining. While the Fallout series has not had a reputation for faultless programming, partially a consequence of its extensive scope, it's disappointing and jarring to have an enemy – or worse, yourself – stuck in the side of a rock with no way to escape.  Nevertheless, Fallout: New Vegas certainly progresses the series, working on the framework of Fallout 3, while taking more influence from the preceding Fallout games and instituting some of the visions that were planned for Van Buren. Paradoxically, in terms of the series progression, it may have made more sense to term this to be the third instalment in the main series, and have named Fallout 3 something along the lines of Fallout: Capital Wasteland. Either way, Fallout: New Vegas is a reasonably well-crafted and frequently fun game which only suffers from the minor disappointment of persistent bugs.",

I did the same thing you did in Fallout 3, made and named your character, (Mine being as ugly as can be and being named ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ McGee, also unintentional rhyming!) put points into S.P.E.C.I.A.L., etc etc. When I finally made it out of the shack you start in, I walked straight ahead and never looked back on the little starting town called Goodsprings. That's the amazing thing about the Fallout series: It's completely open! You can ignore the storyline and just go around popping Deathclaws in the face with your 50 cal sniper rifle, or you can bargan with merchants to get better and better gear. You can almost literally do whatever you want from the very start of the game. I haven't quite played another game that felt like this.  Final verdict: It is a game WELL worth your 20 bucks. It's a gaming experence you can never truly forget.",

Fallout: New Vegas is very well written, as it adjoins dark, somber plot points with welcome humor and lightheartedness. The game is made even more interesting by the degree to which the player can affect the story and the outcome. There is very little in the way of a linear plot.  The game's combat system does tend to get slightly repetitive but very little of the game is actually spent in combat. It is mostly a matter of making decisions and exploring the semblance of society that exists in the Mojave Wasteland.  Although I've heard the game get a bad reputation due to bugs and the like, I found that it ran very, very smoothly on even a standard PC and the few bugs did not interfere much if at all with the gameplay.  If you can get this game for cheap during a sale, it is mandatory to purchase it. If you want this game but there is no sale, it is still well worth it because you will probably not playing much else for the next few weeks, at the very least.

So for the rest of this review, I am going to assume that you have not gotten any of the DLC. Let's roll.  Fallout: New Vegas is a first person shooter RPG and the sequal to Fallout 3. In the game you play as a courier in the city of Las Vegas after a nuclear war. On your way to deliver a mysterious package which was turned down by the previous courier, you are captured by a thug named Benny, who steals your delivery before shooting you in the head twice and burying you. Somehow, however, you manage to survive the gunshot wounds to your cranium and are dug up by a robot named Victor and brought to a doctor in goodsprings. This is where the game begins. As the doctor goes through your medical exam, you get to customize your character to your liking, changing their looks, stats, and starting abilities. As you progress, you come to your first decision in the game, where an escaped convict named Joe Cobb threatens Goodsprings because they are holding someone inside the gas station who Joe wants dead. You are given the choice between joining the powder gangers or holding up a defense against them in goodsprings, or even leaving the whole incident alone. The game has a load of weapons, armor, and items to collect, and many different character and faction builds. From what I have gathered, there are 4 different main endings, followed by an explaination of what happened to all of the other characters and locations you met during your journey.  Overall, I would highly reccomend this game to anyone.",

There is a coherent story line in each game but you are free to go off the reservation and explore all the game has to offer at your leisure. Bethesda is really good at implementing open world games.  My major criticism would be lack of support for Win 7 and later. Fallout III and Fallout NV will apparently run on most versions of Win 7, but be prepared to do some tech homework to keep the game from crashing regularly on some systems.

I never really got into the lore of the story either. Oh, and the AI for companions is just plain awful. Playing it on hardcore is not worth as your companions will often bolt off to who knows where and you are greeted with an alert that they have died (setting them to stay or passive is no help).  The plus sides far out weight the negatives. Complete freedom in what you wish to do, a hearty helping of a variety of weapons and armor, crafting, skills, implants, etc. You really do get to play any way you want to. I would recommend getting all the DLC as each pack ups the level cap by 5 levels so you can go all the way to 50. Granted, once you are this high, you will have so many perks you will feel close to unstoppable but there are still a few legendary enemies out there that you will have to be a bit strategic with. While it is worth it to raise the level cap, do not expect too much from the DLC. Dead Money is pretty bad but the others are passable.  Overall, 8.7/10.",

My two biggest beefs with the game are that the graphics look pretty rough and the story is pretty bland. Poor textures and stiff looking characters are seen throughout. I never really got into the lore of the story either. Oh, and the AI for companions is just plain awful. Playing it on hardcore is not worth as your companions will often bolt off to who knows where and you are greeted with an alert that they have died (setting them to stay or passive is no help).  The plus sides far out weight the negatives. Complete freedom in what you wish to do, a hearty helping of a variety of weapons and armor, crafting, skills, implants, etc. You really do get to play any way you want to. I would recommend getting all the DLC as each pack ups the level cap by 5 levels so you can go all the way to 50. Granted, once you are this high, you will have so many perks you will feel close to unstoppable but there are still a few legendary enemies out there that you will have to be a bit strategic with. While it is worth it to raise the level cap, do not expect too much from the DLC. Dead Money is pretty bad but the others are passable.  Overall, 8.7/10.",

From a combination of my countless hours I've logged into this game on my PS3 and combined with the 65+ plus hours of this on my PC I have explored every aspect this game has to offer. Fallout itself has been my favorite game series of all time and Fallout 3 made me see what the series could become after Fallout 2. I anticipated the release of this game and I pre-ordered it and I can see why, this game is worth every penny for it and all it's DLC. The Post-Apocolyptic RPG game was started by Wasteland, which is the father of all games of this genre, but Fallout ignited a whole new spark. This game, the fire the spark caused is at it's best which means I think Fallout New Vegas is the best Fallout game to be released. Back when Fallout 3 was released in the fall of 2008, it recieved praise as one of the greatest open world RPGs' of the time, this exceeds that to me. A great and perfectly designed world and map, fitting graphics, great music and voice acting, and overall great story and gameplay. I would reccomend this to anyone who loves RPG games. My seal of approval, yet again.  10/10",

            "review_text": "There can never be enough recommendations for Fallout: New Vegas. So I'm here to add another one. This is a game I will never stop playing. Even though I've gotten all the steam achievements, I still haven't explored all that this game has to offer. I've seen and memorized much of the Mojave Wasteland, but with each new playthrough, there is something new to learn and something new to do or discover. This is one of the best games I have ever played and I can never thank enough the friend who first got me to play a Fallout game. I'm not sure what to say about this game that hasn't already been said-nor am I sure how to properly praise it in some new and informative way. I will try to do so, however. For starters, there are at least 4 main paths and endings to arrive at depending on whether you help yourself to everything, or pick a side with the NCR, or Caesar's sexist Legion, or help out Mr. House, the mysterious ancient protector of New Vegas. I believe I played through the main story 4 or 5 times to unlock every achievement. I wanted to do everything there is to do in New Vegas. I STILL want to do everything. I tried out a few playstyles for my first few runs through the game. At first I was a thieving monster helping out the sexist Legion as a melee focused woman. MY second playthrough, I tried to be as good as possible and helped out the NCR the whole way and mostly used pistols and other small guns. On the 3rd run, I helped out Mr. House as a big gun toting canniballistic psychopath. My last couple runs I focused on melee and boosting my damage resistences and then boosted my little pistols as much as I could to shoot down people who ran away from me. I found that was my favorite playstyle. I really love the feeling of freedom that this game brings. There's an ample amount of customization to make your own unique Courier-especially with the addition of the gun mods and the new faction system that lets you know your standing with each of the groups in the game. I could go on and on for hours about this game, but I'm realizing I won't say anything someone else hasn't already said. I mostly just felt this game deserved the recommendation and am trying to honor it by giving it one. Like I said at the start-this game can never have enough recommendations.",

From the first time I walked out of the doctor's office and into Goodsprings, listening to Dean Martin on Radio New Vegas, the atmosphere and attitude of this game hooked me. The clever humor, fun perks, and the variety of characters you meet in your travels through the wasteland make for an engrossing and entertaining adventure. When describing Fallout to friends new to the series, I often describe it as similar to an Elder Scrolls game set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Obviously, there are key differences in gameplay, atmosphere, and mechanics, but they are alike in their near-perfection of the single player RPG. Few single player games come close to matching the depth of either series and even fewer have held such a dedicated and fanatical following. Just check the number of mods available on  nexusmods.com  (and the fact that new mods are put out nearly every day) and you will get an idea of how people feel about this game.   Some people like Fallout 3 better than New Vegas; some people point to the fact that Obsidian developed NV while Bethesda developed Fallout 3 and the modern Elder Scrolls games as evidence that New Vegas a farmed-out product of lesser quality. While there is no accounting for taste, I prefer New Vegas to Fallout 3 because I love the music and old-west atmosphere of New Vegas. While the game is great without mods, I must say that even after 150 hours on the vanilla game, playing again with dozens of mods and all the expansions on PC is close to a totally different experience. Project Nevada, NMC's texture pack, Weapon Mods Expanded (to name a few of the best) really make New Vegas feel at home on PC as a platform and add a level of challenge and scrappiness that should please any Fallout veteran who may find the basic mode lacking in difficulty.",

Cons Still a ton of bugs, wtf! Luckly non that wanted me kms. You can't play after finishing the main story line, you can still play by reloading a save, but then you're just back and I guess you can do the thinks you didn't and get a better ending.

Now, I've played New Vegas for about 300 hours on the PC, but i have got New Vegas for the XBOX 360 and for PS3. On the PS3 I have played for nearly a 700 hours. XBOX 360 Version was about the same as the PS3 (obviously), but haven't played since my save files got corrupt.  Pro's: 1. Excellent Gameplay. Like i mean this it's really good.  2. A very extensive modding community. Which add's replayability. 3. It's a Fallout game. Who wouldn't like a Fallout game? 4. Has a lot of side quest's. Unlike Fallout 3. 5. Has ironsights on weapons. Unlike Fallout 3. 6. Interesting NPC's. Well not that interesting, but still...  Con's 1. The Mojave Wasteland isn't a very interesting place. 2. The PC port is bull$hit, but you can fix the problem's in 10 minutes or so. 3. Annoying stutters. Many mod's to fix them (30Hz Microstutter's are still noticeable).  I highly recommend you to buy this game. It's hella awesome.  EDIT: Forgot to mention, mods are very easy to install.  EDIT 2: It's September 14, 2015 and only 56 day's remaining till Fallout 4!!",

I thought I really enjoyed Fallout 3, and now that game seems hollow by comparison. This is the best RPG I've played in a long while. The writing, the quest depth, and most importantly, the effect you have on the world, all of it contributes to a truly immersive Fallout. I felt compelled to experience as much of the Mojave Wasteland as I could, and I think I got most of it in the end.  There were still bugs to deal with. Bethesda's engine sucked even by 2010 standards, and it shows. I experienced my fair share of Crash To Desktops during area transitions with no apparent solution other than saving often. Even with massive graphics mods, the game looks like ♥♥♥. Yet none of this was enough to turn me away from the incredible game Obsidian cooked up.   Now I dare to dream Bethesda can find it in their hearts to give Obsidian/InXile/Whoever another crack at a Fallout spin-off.  Worth your time, even at full price. Get it on sale, absolutely.

The setting, the gameplay, the story, the choices you make, all beat out Fallout 3. Companions are the best part in the game improved over Fallout 3 with all of them having backstories and their own personal quests. Also they will comment on certain things throughout your adventure unlike fallout 3's companions.  Unlike Fallout 3 where it pretty much was you are either good or bad. New Vegas can ensure you can be somewhere in the middle and which side you lean towards more with the factions system along with its fame and infamy system.  Gunplay also felt improved with different ammo types, iron sights and mods for the weapons.  In terms of DLC, some are better than others unlike fallout 3 where I thought all of them were amazing.(Im looking at you Dead Money). But still I say they are all worth playing. Honest Hearts and Lonesome Road especially.  The game however sufffers from more problems than fallout 3 and Im saying that cause it crashes more than Fallout 3 did for me but its pretty minor.

The setting took place in the Mojave Desert with a different story line. You are caught between tug of power between 2 major factions with other smaller groups coming into the story. There a new weapons, armors and enemies but the biggest enhancement to the game I would say is the weapons modification.   To those who are new to the game, New Vegas allows you to play as first and third person shooter in the post apocalyptic barren wasteland. You may chosee to approach the combat real-time (stealth or run and gun) or utilize the queue system called Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System, or V.A.T.S. where you can zoom in and choose which part of the enemy you wish to attack. You may queue as many actions as your Action Points allow. Characters can level up and you may customize you character via Attribut Points, Skill Points and Perks.   Again, there are tonnes of in-game side quest with a new card game called Caravan which you can challange several NPCs. Tonnes of bugs but none which can't be fixed with mods. The 5 DLCs gives user a different background and approach to the game and adds on loads of items.   Overall this game is definitely worth getting.",

Or if you are new to the seires and were wondering which game to start out with, I would say start with 3. the reason is that it's the more basic out of the two (3 and NV, discluding 1,2 &amp;tactics to there different fourmuler from action RPG) and is an easy introduction to the new action rpg formuler it has been given. and if you liked what you played with that, then give New Vegas a try.  what New Vegas has over 3 is... better story telling more detailed &amp; proper companions (which have there own individual voice actors) an ingame hardmode setting bigger weapon veriaty (for each type) ammo types for you fire arms weapon mods!!! morality dose not dictate everything (moraly gray choices and decisions) no rediculise dialogue 'chance to pass' and an actual check pass still has a healthy modding community.  what is not as great about it... smaller map less awe in visual setting, (apocolyptic setting in desert still looks like desert) not much of discovery/adventuer vibe in NV then 3 same gose for the DLC, still good but 3 had it slightly stronger slightly more prone to crash  thats all i could think of. and this is one of my favorite games of all time (mostly spent on the 360) Any incorrections in this, please correct.",

I was sadly dissapointed when those were all true with their latest release of their Fallout series, Fallout: New Vegas. Jokes aside, New Vegas was a new experience for me. I've never played any of the previous Fallouts, but I do know the general lore behind it (nuclear apocalypse, depressing stories, humanity is bad, etc). I've always wanted to play Fallout 3 though, so I was pretty excited to play this game.  After accidently skipping the cutscene at the begining, I awake to an old guy who tells me to design my character's ugly mug. I guess the first casualty of a nuclear apocalypse is apparently fashion. Mohawks, really? Assigning the skill points and going through a Rorscharch test, I finally finish the tutorial and am ready to leave Doc Mitchell's place. With bated breath, I open the door to start the 'Fallout experience' I've been missing for so long- ... I crashed. God damn it. Seriously, bandits aren't the hardest thing in the game. Neither are the Caeser's Legion or NCR. Not even deathclaws are this hard. It's getting past doors. Specifically the ones that transitions you to different areas.  I may be over-exaggerating this, but crashing is a major problem about this game. For me, the most common crashes are when the loading screen appears. It's easily rectified by quick-saving before doing anything, but sometimes you forget and lose hours of playtime. Moving on to the story now.  Story: The story is pretty cool. Don't worry, I'll keep it spoiler free.  The game starts with your character's death. Then, the credits roll. The end.  Gameplay: SKYRIM WITH GUNS BROWN EVERYWHERE RADIATION EVERYWHERE RADROACHES EVERYWHERE CAESAR'S LEGION ASSASSINS EVERYWHERE DEATHCLAWS EVERYWHERE  player.rewardxp 99999 gg  Pros: +RPG elements are well done and executed (Borderlands is what NOT to do) +Some side-quests are fun/ny +Different character interactions +Events in the game and side-quests can affect what bystanders say to you +Quirky companions (Veronica and Gannon are personal favourites) +DLC's are fun as heck, but ♥♥♥♥ Sierra Madre. That ♥♥♥♥ ain't fun at all (Old World Blues is my favourite) +&lt;3 Ed-e &lt;3  Cons: -Crashes, if I hadn't said that already -So many bugs, frogs call this game 'heaven'. They range from funny A.I glitches to game-breaking falling-off-the-map glitches. -Caesar's Legion -Some speech challenge that allows you to bypass gun-fights feels very anti-climatic, especially after a huge lead-up (like when you first meet the Legate, Lanius, who everyone says can kill an army single-handedly. With a couple lines of Speech checks, he runs away finishing the game) -SIERRA ♥♥♥♥ING MADRE, LITERALLY THE WORST DLC  8.5/10 bethesda pls fix krash kthnx  EDIT: Whoops, forgot to add that I highly recommend getting all the DLCs. They really enhance your gameplay experience. GIVE BETHESDA ALL YOUR MONEY KTHNX. Also added another pro/con.",

I didn't really care for Dead Money, and it seemed drawn out and grindy. I though Lonesome Road was pretty much just an extension of the main story. Built in modding is another plus (unfortunately it doesn't have Workshop). My main complaint is the constant crashing and corrupted save files (this is even without mods). One trick to avoid corrupted save files is to not use Quick Save, and just manual save all the time. I'm not sure why, but that seemed to stop my saves from getting corrupted. In terms of crashing, it can be pretty sporadic. I've gone weeks with no crashes, and then I'll have three in a row. The best solution I've found is to constantly validate the files, since they seem to get corrupted fairly easy.  If you go ahead with this game, just make sure to save constantly. I try to have around 5 saves per character, plus the autosave, and I'll save every 15-20 minutes. This is generally a good habit to have whenever playing a Bethesda game anyway. ",

But you are delivering the chip to decide the coin flip of not three but four superpowers in the Mojave Wasteland: the New California Republic, the Legion, the House of New Vegas, and with the last one being just a single person: You. But you first need to deal with a guy who left you a little problem: Being left for dead in a shallow grave with two bullet wounds in the head. Okay, maybe not so little. But you are the Courier and you deliver. The only questions are: is what, and to whom?  Great game. It a mix of wild west, after the end, and various sci-fi. And it’s fun to mod the heck out of it, even when you have played the game several times over, as you can make it into a completely new game.  The main problem of the game though is the unstability of it, or in other words, it is prone to crashing. It needed more testing and refinement before being released, but they rushed the release date. Word of warning, some mods are liable to make it crash more, depending on the mod.  But one mod I definitely recommend is a compilation mod from Nexus Mods: Project Nevada. You can sprint and tackle people depending on your strength. See that Deathclaw? See that cliff it is standing next to. PSYCHICS... or PHYSICS! Doesn't matter, you aren't probably going to succeed. They are called DEATHclaws for a reason.",

When I say style, I'm referring to the mood that the game creates through visuals, music, sound effects, and story telling. Good Fallout games, inspired by the original Wasteland, are known for a gritty, and dark sense of humor. The post holocaust world is a miserable place that has left behind the simple, and frivolous glory days of the 50's before the nukes dropped; yet the remnants of that glorious technology, as well as its advertising, still remain. Sure, it's a cautionary tale at some level, but you can't help laughing at the reprogrammed house bot that is cheerfully trying to destroy you. It's just a surreal experience to see how the creators' of Fallout invision people adapting to the new normal.  Anyway, I didn't play Fallout 3 because of bad reviews, but I'm glad that Fallout: New Vegas has recaptured the sense of style that fans of the series love.  The game has a few bugs, like characters using invisible items, and corrupt saves, but as long as you remember not to rely on the auto save, and save once in a while yourself, you'll be fine.",

The gameplay is really good, probably the best Bethesda-era Fallout in terms of RPG elements. I personally think that RPG elements are very, very important. Sure, the sheer gameplay of Fallout 4 is better for sure, but the RPG elements of that game are non-existant. The only thing Fallout 4 has on this are the graphics, settlements, and the crafting systems. But I think the bullet system and hardcore is well worth the trade-offs. Now, Fallout 4 is pretty good, and I am only giving constructive criticism. But for review purposes, if you have a choice between Fallout 4 and this, NV wins everytime.",

Now I still love Fallout 3 to death and I actually love them equally now. Now first thing's first, the Factions. I'm all American and whenever fourth of July rolls around I almost lose my hand every time. So I basically imagined the NCR (New California Republic) as the American atriots (even thought that's the enclave's job.) So in this edition after the first storyline of you being shot in the head it opens up a new storyline. You've got yourself some good gear and can handle yourself, so now they stop treating youlike a five year old with down syndrome and they give you a decision of what faction you can join. NCR (Good Guys.), Legion (Jesus, they're litterally nailing people to the cross.), Mr. House (A man that just wants money or power, AKA the CEO of Gamestop.), and Wild Card (You.) My first playthrough was wildcard, I was super evil and wrecked the Legion and NCR. My second, which I'm currently on now, I'm NCR. I actually did beat the game the first time on console with Legion though. Oh yes, now the second thing the Strip. Now this is the first time any Fallout game in existence has ever focused on one city, and for the Strip to be the oasis in the wastes it's pretty dissapointing. The city size is small and freeside is seperated into little doors because of motherf*cking console limitations. I have nothing against console gamers but seriously come on! This isn't a main release in the franchise, this is a how do I say... side game. It could've been a PC release only, nobody would've cared. Anyways 3rd. The map, not very big covered in sand and a giant wasteland until you reach the Vegas area. But I just blabbered on about how it sucked and it was just lazy and boring, blah,blah,blah. Bullsh*t. It fits the franchise perfectly although I prefer the Fallout 3 wasteland better this, this is really good too. It fits Fallout 1 and 2. perfectly and I take my hat off to you developers for respecting the developers of Fallout 1 and 2 (Which I own both by the way including tactics.) Now, the story is amazing too and I cannot explain anymore and I will now rate this game from 1/10. Now this game and Fallout 3 both have a 10/10 rating. So yes 10/10. Buy this game if you liked Fallout 3 or if your new to the franchise.",

Fallout New Vegas is the pinnacle of RPG gaming, setting players in a desolate and depressing wasteland, fighting for (and against) different factions amidst a raging conflict that has ravaged the Mojave Desert. Players who enjoyed Fallout 3 should not miss this gem, as it enhances every aspect of it, from perks to weapon mods, plot to companions and many more.   Also, the DLC content has an overall better plot and better mechanics than the entire game of Skyrim. My opinion to be honest, but that's how I felt.

The game play sometimes gets difficult and wildely unrealistic, for example shooting someone in the head with a bullet that is bound to penetrate their skull and tear up their brain only does like 15 hp to them. The game's graphics are exceptionally well done and add to the theme very well with rust, burnt buildings, dead people, gore, and alot more.

Ok so I will begin the review. If you're considering buying this or Fallout 4, don't, just buy this. If you like action shooters that don't challenge you in any way and hold your hand the whole way through then buy Fallout 4, if you want an in-depth RPG game that will make you question what is right and wrong while still maintaining fun gameplay, get this. The gunplay isn't as good as the gunplay in Fallout 4, but everything else about this game is superior, I also loved Fallout 3 and the original Fallouts. I personally preferred Fallout 3 to this game but I loved them both and this game is newer so a new player would porbably enjoy this more. This game is packed full of meaningful quests that don't feel like a grind and aren't repetitive (unlike Fallout 4's Minutemen quests) and you will always have something to do. New Vegas itself is very large and crammed with interesting things to do, the rest of the world also has interesting things to explore but as it is depicting a post-apocolyptic wasteland it is obviously not a masterpiece. The dialogue options in this game allow actual choice and give you the freedom to develop your character based on your personal beliefs and opinions, and the whole conversation system allows for plenty of outcomes (Again, unlike Fallout 4). At the very bare minimum, you will spend 100 hours in this game, my 222 hours is nothing special as people have put plenty more into the game than that, it is a very deep experience and is probably the most enjoyable Fallout experience for new players. If you buy this game (which at the moment for £9.99 I think you definitely should) and you love it, then also consider playing The Elder Scrolls games if you haven't already as they provide a similar experience but in a difference setting. Skyrim is probably the best Elder Scrolls game to start with and if you like it and feel like trying out something more complicated (but deeper and more rewarding) then consider trying out Morrowind. Sorry for drifting from the subject a bit there but my personal rating of this game is 9/10, it's one of the best Action RPG's on the market allowing for plenty of choice and replayability, similar games which you may also like are Fallout 3 (Which I give 9.5/10 but it is older than this game) and Skyrim (9.5/10). The reason that I prefer Fallout 3 to this game is that the story and quests are superior to this game, however the general gameplay in this in better. If you have the money then buy them both and make your own opinion on which you prefer.  If you want a good RPG that you can sink hundreds of hours into, then buy this game, for £9.99 you can't go too far wrong, and it is much better than Fallout 4 for less than half the price. 9/10",

New Vegas is the rise to civilization in Post Apocaliptia (not the real name, it's still just United States), and you're doing a lot more than fighting for your life this time. However, most times you will play it, you have a little more of a choice: murder or reason. Because in civilization you're making that choice.  But war never changes.",

However, after asking around, the popular opinion that people told me was that they thought New Vegas was the better game. The game was recently on sale for around $6 so I decided to pick it up since I had some extra money in my Steam Wallet. What I found was that the game is a lot more immersive, a lot more fun, and your choices have a huge effect on the rest of your game experience. Helping one faction in their quests makes the rival faction start disliking you. You can choose to help any faction you want, or you can run the show on your own and do things completely solo. The mods that can be found on the Nexus for this game are almost as great as Skyrim and add a lot to the game.  Pros:  - Immersive Gameplay - Different ways to complete the game - Your actions matter - Diverse enemies - Interesting characters - Compelling story - Great mods available   Cons:  - DLC is not that impressive - Navigation can at times become a chore - Completing the last mission returns you to the point before starting it. You can't complete it and then keep going with other side quests (Like the Mass Effect games)   Verdict:  9/10 - The best Fallout experience. Fun gameplay, interesting story, great land to explore.",

Collision detection can be goofy in game and if there are two items on a table to grab I have to choose wisely as I am not surprised to watch the other item fall through the table as soon as I grab the first item thus rendering the second item un-usable by me.  It can sometimes be glitchy even when running New Vegas Anti Crash.  The rate at which you gain experience is totally out of whack with the content just in the initial game. As an example when I went through my first time I completed most of the quests out in the wastelands and I was level 46 before going to Hoover Dam. I hadn't completed any of the DLC at that point either. Just the basic game. Second run I had to install mods to cut the experience gained by about 2/3rds so I wouldn't be max level prior to finishing the game &amp; DLCs.  Must mod the game with non-official bug patches to take care of goofy bugs, etc.  Conclusion: Even though it requires a fair amount of learning and work on the part of the end user you get paid off in spades (!) for that time invested to get it up and running. Even modded it has odd glitches on occasion and can still crash but for the most part it behaves itself.",

A few years ago I played  Fallout 3  for a long time. I really liked the gameplay and 'open world' was new to me. I liked playing the  GTA series  and loved games, where the player was not bound to any storyline and was free to do whatever he liked.  That's the same case in  Fallout: New Vegas . You go whereever you like and do whatever you like. What I really enjoy in this game is that your actions have consequences. If you kill gang members, that specific gang will hate you. On the other side, you will gain fame by other gangs. This leads to a point, where you can do only a given number of missions. If people like you, they will ask you for help. If not, they will try to kill you in worst case.  Another cool part is the use of experience. You allocate your experience in points and increase your characters abilities. This opens you new possibilities ingame, because in some conversations it is better to have a high level of speech, in other situations you need a high level of lockpicking to open doors which stay locked until you have meet the requirements.  All in all,  Fallout: New Vegas  has infinite possibilities and makes a lot of fun to play and to see what consequences your actions have. I recommend this game for everyone enjoying to experiment in games and to all who like to have a free hand without being bound to the main story line.",

            "review_text": "As a veteran of Fallout 3 and all the DLC that came with it, I gotta say that I was a little let down with the start of New Vegas, but ultimately enjoyed the game not quite to the extent of the previous installment but it came close.   As opposed to being a blank slate born and raised within your sheltered Vault 101, where you make each and every choice as you grow older, Vegas tosses you in as a courier assigned with taking a package to the New Vegas Strip...instead, a guy in a checkered suit intercepts you, shoots you in the head, and buries you in the middle of the night. Good job! Maybe for you next trick, you can demonstrate how to tend for your garden but get abducted by Super Mutants.  The starting town, Goodsprings, isn't bad per-say, but it's no Megaton or Tenpenny Towers. The thing I didn't like was how wide open it was, it's one of those towns that anything could just stroll on up and attack you for no damn reason and the other townsfolk wouldn't so much as bat an eye. 'Oh no! It's a pack of Deathclaws! Wait, they're only after that new guy they dug up yesterday, we're good.'  The karma system returns but it takes a backseat to something Fallout 2 had which is the Faction System. Basically, if you do something for one faction (say, clearing a bunch of a different faction from a stronghold) you gain fame for that faction while gaining infamy from the other, so trying to maintain a neutral stance is difficult but not impossible. The main factions are that of the NCR (New Californian Republic) and Caesar's Legion (read 'kai-zar'), the two-head bear and the golden bull, both commanding large numbers of warriors but not the only factions in play for the ultimate endgame.  I will say that the characters in this game were great, not that they weren't in 3 but I feel like you get to explore their personalities more than in the other game. Take the Kings for example, a gang of thugs that run everything in Freeside BUT they operate out of 'The King's School of Impersonation' and were convinced that Elvis was an Old World god and that the school is a shrine dedicated to trying to achieve his likeness so they all dress like him and talk like him. There's also a redesigned companion interface that I'm thankful for along with the ability to craft your own ammo from spend shells that's a neat touch.  The weapons, especially if you get the Gun Runner's Arsenal DLC, are really a lot of fun to play with, ranging from a chainsaw to the Anti-Material Rifle, dispatching those who would wish to cause you harm (or you just feel like murdering them just for fun), then these varying weapons have you covered.  New Vegas, sadly, suffers in the form of it can get really hard really fast if you don't keep your wits about you. There are also these things called Cazadors (giant, flying, wasp things that are hard to hit outside of V.A.T.S in early levels) that will swarm you and attack constantly until you either die from their poison or or they stab you to death before it kicks in. Also...  YOU CAN'T CLIMB MOUNTAINS ANYMORE! God, the one thing that made traveling to new locations in Fallout 3 was the ability to hop, skip, and jump over mountains and then ropelessly repel your way down to the other side instead of trying to go around and getting yourself murdered because of a lack of Stimpacks; GONE. I don't get it! You could do it almost everywhere in Fallout 3 AND Skyrim if you tried hard enough but not anymore! Even if the ledge that stops you doesn't even make it to you shins it will halt all attempts to jump over it to your destination, forcing you to go ALL the way around the other side.   Ron Perlman says war never changes, and while that might be so, the Fallout series sure has. New Vegas does a lot of things right and a lot of things wrong (*cough* Dead Money *cough*), but it's still a Fallout game and I still loved playing the fifty hours it took to beat, and I didn't even get all of the locations discovered or all of the side quests done. Guess that's something the next Courier will have to try on Hardcore Mode...",

How about the tons and tons of great characters populating this little corner of the US wastelands? Or the wonderful atmosphere? The good music? The absolutely amazing modding community?  Aw, what the heck. It's  all  pretty sweet.    The Bad   F:NV was a bit of a rushed product, and through Obsidian is responsible for a lot of the content, it's still based on an engine made by Bethesda. This means that, sadly, there are a lot of bugs and other problems both left in because there wasn't time to fix them and because there are inherent problems with the system itself.  Fortunately, the aforementioned modding community means that a lot of these things can be ameliorated or even eliminated. Unfortunately, they can't catch or deal with everything, so sometimes you'll still run up on some weird and wacky stuff that the creators never intended to happen.  Also, cazadores. Seriously, ♥♥♥♥ those damn things.    Overall   I've been a fan of  Fallout  ever since I bought the first and second on in a two-pack ages ago, so this game is like a huge, delicious feast for me. I thought I was perfectly happy with  Fallout 3  until  New Vegas  came along and reminded me how great the series was in the hands of those who helped create it and just how great it could continue to be.

Call it lazy or non-innovative, but sticking to something that works is not a bad thing. [Don't fix it if it ain't broke]  This game uses passionate voice actors to make it actually seem you are talking to that certain NPC and missions are varied, interesting, and non-linear. I understand the Fallout graphics aren't that great, but with a world that big teeming with hundreds of buildings, animals, and NPC's, it's amazing what this engine can do.   My only gripe with this game is the whole 'every other level allows you to choose a new perk.' I liked fallout 3's perk system alot better because there was more variation in a single character, but it's not that big of a deal.   All in all, like I said before, if you liked fallout 3, don't miss out on this game, and with the steam sales coming up, you'd be a fool not to purchase it. Good luck in the Mojave!",

New Vegas eventually made RPG's my favorite genre of game, and Bethesda my second favorite studio, only behind Valve. I think New Vegas has some of the best writing ever to reach Steam and a weaponry/combat system that could have been its own game. Fallout 3 was a bit cliche in its story and was lacking in its combat, but Obsidian definitely fixed both of those and improved on the graphics, acting, and scripting of the previous game.

Now I still love Fallout 3 to death and I actually love them equally now. Now first thing's first, the Factions. I'm all American and whenever fourth of July rolls around I almost lose my hand every time. So I basically imagined the NCR (New California Republic) as the American atriots (even thought that's the enclave's job.) So in this edition after the first storyline of you being shot in the head it opens up a new storyline. You've got yourself some good gear and can handle yourself, so now they stop treating youlike a five year old with down syndrome and they give you a decision of what faction you can join. NCR (Good Guys.), Legion (Jesus, they're litterally nailing people to the cross.), Mr. House (A man that just wants money or power, AKA the CEO of Gamestop.), and Wild Card (You.) My first playthrough was wildcard, I was super evil and wrecked the Legion and NCR. My second, which I'm currently on now, I'm NCR. I actually did beat the game the first time on console with Legion though. Oh yes, now the second thing the Strip. Now this is the first time any Fallout game in existence has ever focused on one city, and for the Strip to be the oasis in the wastes it's pretty dissapointing. The city size is small and freeside is seperated into little doors because of motherf*cking console limitations. I have nothing against console gamers but seriously come on! This isn't a main release in the franchise, this is a how do I say... side game. It could've been a PC release only, nobody would've cared. Anyways 3rd. The map, not very big covered in sand and a giant wasteland until you reach the Vegas area. But I just blabbered on about how it sucked and it was just lazy and boring, blah,blah,blah. Bullsh*t. It fits the franchise perfectly although I prefer the Fallout 3 wasteland better this, this is really good too. It fits Fallout 1 and 2. perfectly and I take my hat off to you developers for respecting the developers of Fallout 1 and 2 (Which I own both by the way including tactics.) Now, the story is amazing too and I cannot explain anymore and I will now rate this game from 1/10. Now this game and Fallout 3 both have a 10/10 rating. So yes 10/10.

It feels less anarchic to me due to the presence of civilizations and organizations that allow the wasteland to be alive while still being ruined and destroyed at the same time.

            "review_text": "Fallout New Vegas is a startlingly poingaint return to form for the fallout series, by obsidian entertainment.  After several missteps, through half-baked, slightly off sequels(brotherhood of steel, tactics, and fallout 3) the fallout brand was in serious danger of becoming another samey, annualized series.   Thankfully, Obsidian entertainment was able to step in, and right the nearly capsised intelectual property, with this entry in the series - new vegas!  Heralding the return of smart writing, and an intelligently built, internally consistent world, new vegas successfully washes the taste of several of the more, dissapointing, developments brought on by fallout 3 and tactics. It's easier to forget the fact that harold the ghoul is now a tree, and the brotherhood is stomping around, dumbly white-knighting around the east coast, when things in post apocalyptic california are still so barren, harsh, yet filled with the kind of interesting characters, and situations that make a proper fallout RPG.  The interactivity of the world makes for a great improvement in this spinoff-sequel, granting the player the ability to really make a difference with regard to outcomes and dispositions of the various factions, and individuals, in the sprawling new vegas wastes. This interactivity comes in the form of properly implemented skill checks, stat, and influence prompts, and even situations calling for the prescence of a specific perk! These opportunities to leverage the advantage of, not just a properly built character, but a uniquely built one, lead to interesting gameplay situations, and most importantly, a lot of choice and consequence, which at it's core, lends the player a feeling of truly influencing the virtual world. For me at least, this is very enjoyable, and lies at the heart of any true fallout experience, as much as the aesthetic ever does.  And, speaking of the aesthetic, I'm happy to report that the fallout aesthetic is alive and well in new vegas! After tactics and fallout 3 took a swing, a very close swing, and missed in terms of setting, it is refreshing to see new vegas do fallout so much justice!  The abandonment of the seriously misunderstood 'FIFTIES!' setting that pervaded fallout 3, is a breath of fresh air, and it's replaced by the more grim, yet interesting and entertaining atmosphere of the earlier games. The reflection of a society that collapsed at the peak of it's technological prowess, so obsessed with an idealized version of itself that it broaches no interference into that fantasy in it's media -- this, not a braindead FIFTIES! vibe, lies at the heart of the fallout setting, at least, the original fallout setting, and it is very, very nice to have it back.  Technically, the game is a disaster, a highly modable, customizable, disaster. Crashes will be present on any machine, with any mod configuration, with any settings. This is unfortunately unavoidable with this particular engine, and a holdover of the application's nature. Unfortunately the gambryo engine that beats at the heart of fallout new vegas is just as prone to crashes, and has been given just as little attention with regard to stability, as the engine in fallout 3 and skyrim. It hasn't changed, at it's core, since it has been used in morrowind, and it desperately calls for a true overhaul, not just the new coat of paint dashed on by skyrim's release. I hope a great deal, that the technical issues that plague new vegas, will be purged from the next iteration of the engine!  This technical mess is made up for, to a degree, by the vast modability of the engine, everything from visuals to basic gameplay elements can be modded and molded to the end - users preference, and this is an amazing achievement. This game truly is a sandbox version of the earlier fallout entries, which is something I adore!  In terms of gameplay, not much is truly altered from Fallout 3, nay, it is distilled and refined, into the RPG fallout 3 could have been. Skill points, stats, and perks can slot together in a wild array of different configurations, allowing the player to truly choose how they wish to navigate the wastes. Most character builds are viable, even the notoriously difficult social butterfly, using words and stealth to deal with the dangers of a post-nuclear las vegas!  I highly reccomend fallout new vegas to any fan of fallout, RPGs, or games in general. The price of admission is a level of patience with glitchy performance and coding, but the reward is an incredibly deep and satisfying RPG experience, wherein you, the player, determine the future of an entire civilization through your choices, and do so in many varied and creative ways, ways that are truly interactive, and truly follow your choices. A boast, that many games make, but very few live up to.",

The controls are just like any major FPS RPG for a pc, however I would definitely reccomend playing it with a controller, it's just smoother and a lot easier obviously.   The graphics are still quite the same as most Fallout game, which is definitely an appeal to me, I enjoy the continuation of the graphics from 3, gave it the same vibe.  The combat system is a little different, yes your plasma, and energy guns still disinegrate, or melt your foes, but there are weapon mods that add uniqueness, and different ammo types to provide more advanced play at the higher levels, and it leaves you strategizing so much in Hardcore mode.  Let's talk about that, Hardcore mode, this adds onto the replayability, and give the game that extra umph for the more hardcore sadistic players.  Overall the game deserves probably an 8.5/10  Minus 1.5 for some minor opinionated things, such as no sprint still, voice acting is a little low tier, they use a lot of the same VA's for many characters, and I believe the reputation system to be a little silly at some points in the game.",

For those who haven't played Skyrim... It's... hard to describe briefly. RPG where anything goes. The game itself is big, open world, many many different things you can do with your character...

One thing you will notice is that this game is huge with a vast and open world for you explore with loads of people to meet, greet and rob.  This game has also updated the weapons in this game to allowing you to mod them for greater fire power, accuracy and reload, as well different types of ammo like hollow point or amour pricing which add new tactics to combat, though I did find sometime I stuck to the same old bullets as long as my gun was powerful enough to take down all the big bad monsters out there in the wasteland.  I also found I was little confused with alignment in this game meaning that there was no real indication with good or bad consequence’s though almost every choose you make has some effect on the people of the wasteland: like allying yourself with the NCR will make you enemies with the legion, or killing or robbing people in a town will make you unwelcome there, so it really make you think before you take action in any mission . I never really got bored with games as there was always another mission around the next corner to keep me busy. They’re also more emphasis on team mates in this game being able to have either EDI or the Dog and one of your main helpers with you can help keep you alive and each one giving different perks to aid you in combat and you can use them to carry more loot to.  This is a great game and worth picking up for all fans of the fallout games I give it 8.5 out 10 ",

            "review_text": "Fallout: New Vegas takes almost all the problems that Fallout 3 had and irons them out.   No longer is the story a line of events that you have no control over. Instead, it starts you off with a single goal: Find the guy who shot you in the head, and deal with him. When going to achieve this goal, your character becomes wrapped up in a nation-wide conflict in which your choices as a player will affect the outcome of an entire nation.  No longer are companions just blank slates with their only trait being they only associate with people who are good, bad and neutral. Companions will sometimes refuse to travel with you due to your karma being too low, but companions now have their own beliefs and goals. They will sometimes chime in on events that have happened, and all have very fleshed out back stories which not only tie them to the current events to the game, but also define their actions and how they react to you, as the player. You can betray them and destroy all they love, or you can help them accomplish their some of their most desired goals.  No longer are the main factions of the game just the morally evil and righteous. Instead of the being the almighty brotherhood of steel and the evil maniacs of the enclave, it's a pre-war style democratic government with all the corruption and scheming it had before the war. It's a a goverment who is run by a person inspired the ancient roman empire of old, with all of its good and bads. And there's also the in between. You can make the Mojave Desert independent through the eccentric mister house, a prewar millionaire who made plans hundreds of years in advance to take over the desert, or you can take over yourself by turning House's own creations against him.  They also have a long list of songs from the the 1950s that really fit the period and really just makes you have feelings only video games can create. In what other form of media can you wander around in a post apocalyptic desert with a floating Robot that plays action music and a Mexican Radiation Zombie gun slinger with western music about duels between an outlaw and a ranger playing in the background? Okay there might be like one other thing that does it, but I don't know of it.  The Gameplay hasn't been changed that much. It's the same first person open world sandbox. However slight improvments and additions have been made to the combat to add variety. Such examples are the addition of throwable weapons such as spears. You can also craft restoratives from the herbs you find in the desert, but this is more useful to those looking to roleplay.  The Graphics can look a little outdated. The engine is very old, but if you know anything about modding, you can easily make this game look up to date. Even without mods, the graphics aren't that bad. They server their purpose, nothing more and nothing less.  If you enjoyed Fallout 3, but felt is was lacking a little something (be that story, character or over all charm) I would HIGHLY recommend this game. If you are a fan of the classic Fallout 1 and 2, but didn't like the way bethesda took the Fallout 3 plot, I would highly recommend this. If you enjoy a good sandbox RPG with simple combat and lots of roleplaying opportunities, I recommend this game.  This game is charming as hell, can be serious and funny whenever it needs to be, and with recent rumors swirling around about Fallout: New Orleans being copyrighted, and that Obsidian being working on that, it is no better time to pick up this unappreciated gem of the last generation.   And, don't get me started on mods. I made this game play almost exactly like Fallout 4 with a few simple downloads.  TL;DR: Graphics: 6/10 Story: 9/10 Gameplay: 8/10 Music: 9/10  Overall: 8/10 For 20$, it's a steal, granting me nearly 100 hours of content even before mods.",

I loved that you could choose 4 different 'factions' (Mr House, Yes Man, The Legion or the NCR) to fight with at the Hoover Dam each one with different endings also when you finish the game a cutscene will tell you what happened to all the 'factions or tribes' that you met throughout the game it could be either good or bad depending on how you treated them. -Something that surprised me is how good the sidequests are. It's awesome how they put a lot of work into them. -If you are playing with guns or energy weapons the combat will be kind of boring but you will be able to deal with it. Now melee combat is awesome super entertaining but hard to get used to especially if you are playing on a hard difficulty. - Weapons variety is huge explosive, energy weapons, melee combat, firearms and even unarmed combat have a wide variety of weapons to choose from and different ways to approach a fight. -Stealth is bad. -All the dlcs are awesome if you are going to buy this game buy the ultimate edition it will be worth the extra money I promise you. Each dlc is filled with a lot of lore. I really enjoyed this game and i totally recommend it my rating is: 9/10 my third favorite game. Note: I played it without mods I know that if you mod it, it will be even a better experience.",

There's a new, good soundtrack, if not a bit limited. Combat seems easier and less dependant on V.A.T.S. You can have several companions to help you out, but they're actually a bit too good.  The world's a bit less varied, smaller and not quite so open, but still packed with atmospheric places to discover. The gameplay's somewhat more linear and clearer in the beginning. Eventually, however, things becomes a spaghetti of quests that are both too easy and too hard, and different factions that conflict eachother. It's quite frustrating and worsened by bugs and inconsistencies.  It's a worthy sequel to F3, if a bit less than I had hoped for, and in many ways different. I still enjoyed it a lot and have no problem recommending it.",

If you loved Fallout 3, you will more than likely love this, and if this is your first Fallout game, you'll enjoy trekking through the desert with your robot/drunkard/sniper companion and laying waste to everything that so much as breathes at you funny. Many hours of enjoyment ahead.  As a side note, this game has an incredible modding community that can expotentially increase the hours you spend playing this game. Mods like Project Nevada change up the gameplay and balance immensely, and are highly recommended after your initial vanilla playthrough (or even for your first time because screw 'developer intent') and subsequent playthroughs. Ontop of that, there are mods that enhance your visuals, providing more darker nights or better indoor lighting, or changing the weather patterns and giving higher resolution textures for almost everything in the game from roads to guns, or ENBs that give a new pallete of color to the wasteland. Even fully voiced (New Vegas Bounties) mod quests.   This is a game absolutely worth your time and money, full price or on sale. Its a game that, while not incredibly polished and may have some questionable decisions, is not one to be missed. And hey, any questionable stuff can be fixed with mods, right? Right.

The only really limitation is the army of deathclaws that block the quick path to Vegas but if you are tricky you can still sneak past it. Forget FO4 failures and go grab this instead!

Maybe that is just because I played it first, but there are a few things that could have been worked on more.  The first being that the map is giant, but it feels so empty and lonesome. The map in Fallout 3 was a massive city with populated suburbs, but that isn't the case with this game. Sure, there is plenty to keep you entertained, but after you've done all the main quests there isn't really much left to explore.  Secondly, all though the DLCs are fleshed out and nice, I feel like it was a lot of new content, sown together with a short story. The Lonesome Road and Blood Money excluded, I feel like the stories were rushed just so that they can pump more content into a game that is already filled with content.  Lastly, as with all Bethesda games, there are invisble walls and unaccessable places all over, but I can get over that since it is expected. But, beside for the small issues I have with the game, overall I say that it is well done and is worth your time. Due to the replayablity and the sheer fun of the game, overall it is a great game.",

I put about 1,800 hours into it on Xbox, which, yeah, I admit, is a little crazy, but this is the Crime And Punishment of video games. The companions are some of the most well written characters in videogames ever - the writing in general is fantastic, especially compared to Bethesda developed games (particularly Fallout 3's 'Macguffin Dad' plot and Skyrim's, uh, everything). The world is highly reactive instead of the bland static worlds of F3 and Skyrim. As you progress in the game some factions like you more and some start to hate you. The karma system from F3 is still in place but it doesn't really affect much - Some companions won't roll with you if your karma gets too low, but faction reputation is by far more important. Probably my favorite story that isn't an actual novel. 1.800 hours is not a joke.   Hardcore mode is the ♥♥♥♥. The DLCs each have a unique flavor and explore a different aspect of the Fallout theme - People who say that this game is not 'Fallouty' enough either A) have only played Fallout 3 (Morons) or B) Did not bother to really dig around the game (Fu*kheads) - A full playthrough, with all the DLCs and sidequests should easily run up into the 150-190 hour range, so ♥♥♥♥ off with your 'I've played this game 30 hours and I have an opinion' - no you don't, just shut up. Jerks.  Seriously, anybody who ♥♥♥♥♥alks this game is an idiot and if you don't play it Baby Jesus will cast you into a lake of burning fire to suffer for all eternity. Because Jesus loves you and wants you to be happy, or else.  That said, the game is buggier than bat guano. Some quest scripts are outright broken - quests will not trigger - In twenty some odd playthroughs (again, on console - the xbox version is the most stable of all three from what I can tell) I have never managed to finish every companion upgrade quest in a single playthrough. Idle NPCs say the same four lines ('Sometimes patrolling the Mojave makes you wish for a nuclear winter' omg just ♥♥♥♥ing kill me now) over and over despite there being a couple dozen in the game files apparently. You will see hundreds of Radscorpions stuck inside of the terrain in the course of a single playthrough. YOU will become stuck in the terrain a couple hundred times in the course of a single playthrough. Depending on your machine and the mods you are running, the game will crash to desktop, and even hard crash your system from time to time. Still, I scoff at your gamer cred if you can't grit through it. If you want a wart free experience, go get a Playstation you ♥♥♥♥in noob. Save early, save often. And you must, must, must use the Freeside Restored and New Vegas Strip Restored mods.",

If I didn't have so many other games to play, I would go back and play this all over again... heck... I might do it anyways.

            "review_text": "Fallout: New Vegas  A post-apocalyptic Role Playing Game set in the Mojave desert, a tale of revenge, origin and answers. Also a tale of slicing people up with chainsaws, or a lone neanderthalian miner who's only friend is his trusty sledgehammer, or a tale of a technophobic businessman, or a tale of whatever you want, really.  I've played this game for 300 hours, and I have completed all the achievements, that should mean I liked my experience with Fallout: New Vegas - at least for the most part. I will go through mostly the negative things about the game, (there are a lot of positives too, but I'm better at focusing at negative stuff) since that's easiest for me. A more positive person would probably give the game a +25% rating or so. Don't get me wrong, this is a GOOD game. Here is my ranking of the different elements in the game, and why:  Fallout: New Vegas 6,29 /10 Customization: 6/10 Visuals: 5/10 Combat: 6,33/10 Storytelling: 7/10 Gameplay: 7/10 Dialogue: 6,5/10 DLC Content: 5,5/10 Music: 7/10  CUSTOMIZATION: (6/10) *Character creation: (6/10) Good amount of sliders and options, though for some reason they always have to make your face tiny and put strange scanline filters all over it so you can't see it clearly. Not too many hair style choices, and no tattoos or similar for some reason. It is decent though. *Crafting: (6/10) During your travels you can craft quite a few items, and although there are fewer weapons to craft than in Fallout 3 you can craft a LOT of consumables, some of wich are really good, and some of wich are basically useless. *Weapon modding: (6/10) An alright modding system, though I would've liked to see more options, especially side-graded mods instead of straight upgrades.  VISUALS: (5/10) An alright looking game, definently suffers from a monotone colour palette. *Animation: (6/10) There are definently some animation glitches, and the general quality is quite basic. *Rigging: (5/10) Most of the rigging seems to be pretty well handled, except for when an NPC is following a given route, then it seems to be twitching along. *Colour Palette: (3/10) Monotone colour palette. The palette is desaturated, (wich is good for that post-apocalyptic feel) but then someone had the bright idea of putting sepia filters all over everything in 70% of the game. If the filters were toned down to maybe 10-20% strength it would contribute. When done in small amounts these filters can really set the mood for certain places, but when it's there all the time it just becomes bland. *Graphical quality: (6/10) In several places you can see mirrored textures and the like, but most enemies are well handled, designed and executed.  COMBAT: (6,33/10) Combat is rewarding, bashing someone's face in, taking a long-ranged headshot or obliterating them with plasma is good fun. *Gun combat: (7/10) Both energy weapons and ballistic. Single-shot weapons gameplay is good in this game, especially Sniper rifles and Shotguns feels great. However,  due to the small auto-aim feature included in the game, fully automatic weapons act weird and not the way you'd expect them to act. The same is true for a few pistols as well, but most of the weapons act the way you want them to. Not a big difference from Fallout 3. * Melee combat: (6/10) Both unarmed, throwing and melee weapons. As New Vegas introduced a few unarmed combat techniques, unarmed combat got a bit more interesting.  However, these techniques replaces your moving power attacks - wich to me is poorly handled. There is a decent variety of unarmed weapons available. The throwing weapons introduced feels like a joke, they disappear when they hit something, and seems like the team just finished it as fast as they could. Melee weapons works out pretty well, though there aren't many interesting melee weapons (at least early in the game). * Explosives: (6/10) Thrown explosives, Big explosive guns. There is a lot of explosives in this game. Especially dynamite, wich is decent but slow. Bigger explosive weapons feels very situational, and has only a few uses that don't make you think there was a better way of dealing with the problem.  STORYTELLING: (7/10) Good storytelling, the game motivates you to explore and make choices. *Main quest: (6/10) Compelling and exciting at first, but getting lost along the more enjoyable side quests. You basically lose interest about it as you move on,  and when you are done it doesn't really feel that rewarding. Lots of choices though, wich makes it all better. *Side quests: (7/10) There are a lot of interesting side quests in the game, motivating you to explore the wastelands.  *Characters: (8/10) Your companions have their own backgrounds and will enjoy or dislike choices you make while wandering the wastes, you will get to know characters in the game more the more time you spend with them, and the more places you visit with them.  *Background: (7/10) The Fallout universe is rich in backstory and New Vegas isn't afraid to use that backstory to tell it's tale.  GAMEPLAY: (7/10) No huge flaws, but a few small quirks you should be aware of. *Game modes: (7/10) Normal mode and Hardcore mode. Hardcore mode means you actually need sleep, food and water or suffer attribute penalties, followed by death.  However, as you are in a desert, you will need to drink regularly. *Logistics: (7/10) Walking around is pretty basic in a game, but somehow the developers managed to make walking and running quite unresponsive and sluggish. Your character doesn't stop when you no longer press the 'forward' key, it takes a fraction of a second before they acctually stop. There are invisible walls spread throughout the world, mostly to deny access to shortcuts over mountains, but sometimes in very strange places. Fast travel works just as in Fallout 3, Oblivion and Skyrim, nothing strange going on.  DIALOGUE: (6,5/10) Very good dialogue options, although just because you CAN say something doesn't mean you should. Just like in real life. *Speech and 'checks' (8/10) Talking, Attribute/skill 'checks' inside of a dialogue is either a failed or passed, and you can see wether you reach the requirements or not. No more '65%' to make it or not, in this game you either have '6/10 STR' or you don't. This is a great system, much better than in Fallout 3.  A huge plus for making talking your way out of almost every problem a possibility. *Non-Important Character lines (5/10) are extremely repetetive, and they re-used lines of dialogue even across different voice actors, wich is both a huge waste of potential and immersion.  DLC CONTENT: (5,5/10) Overall my experience with the DLCs in New Vegas has been positive, and I've played them all several times. *Honest Hearts (5/10) A story that isn't that compelling and you only get along with because you want to see the new place. Some new weapons but nothing special. Interesting new locations though. You forget about this one pretty quickly. *Old World Blues (7/10) The comical, science-based one. Repetetive at times, but so charming you forgive it quickly. Interesting new locations and items.  Adds a little more customization to the game, wich is always welcome. *Lonesome Road (8/10) In my opinion, the best post-apocalyptic feeling in the game. A good amount of new items, a storyline that keeps reminding you about it.  Interesting new locations, just the right size for a DLC. Lots and lots of background information if you are curious enough. *Dead Money (2/10) A frustrating DLC, boring, maze-like environments and a few, not-too-exciting new items, not very interesting characters, way too long. I do not recommend unless you really  want 100% achievements completed.  MUSIC: (7/10) Most of the music is enjoyable and well adapted for the 'wild west' feel of the game. It gets repetetive after a while, but it's pretty good nonetheless.",

But once I started playing after about the first 2 hours... I relized this game is REALLY boring. First of all there is little action and the gameplay is slow. It involves alot of talking and then having to walk for and hour to reach the next spot to talk to someone else. I love Bethesda so I went out and bought Fallout 3 GOTY for my PS3 and again... big dissapointment. Skyrim was great and so was The Evil Within (yes I know those are new and this game is realitvely old) but for this game to be enjoyable... you probably have to play from the begining of the orignial Fallout, bu even then it would be pretty boring, at least to me it would. So in all   Gameplay 5/10 Story 8/10 Replay Value 0/10 Money that should be spent on this game... 0/19.99  --EDIT--  So, recently I was bored so I started going through my game library like any other person would, and I fell upon this game. The game that I said, was terrible, and I thought, why not try it again? I loaded it up and began playing, after about 2 hours, I realized how AWESOME this game really is. If you don't like this game, the problem is your not far enough in yet. Once you get into the story, it's amazing. I don't have many acheivemnets for this game, and that's because I typed in console to fix a glitch/ bug and forgot to reset my game and played for like 6 hours... the game really picks up also once you start doing missions for The King.  So this game after all is 11/10 Would play with Rex again!",

I put about 1,800 hours into it on Xbox, which, yeah, I admit, is a little crazy, but this is the Crime And Punishment of video games. The companions are some of the most well written characters in videogames ever - the writing in general is fantastic, especially compared to Bethesda developed games (particularly Fallout 3's 'Macguffin Dad' plot and Skyrim's, uh, everything). The world is highly reactive instead of the bland static worlds of F3 and Skyrim. As you progress in the game some factions like you more and some start to hate you. The karma system from F3 is still in place but it doesn't really affect much - Some companions won't roll with you if your karma gets too low, but faction reputation is by far more important. Probably my favorite story that isn't an actual novel. 1.800 hours is not a joke.   Hardcore mode is the ♥♥♥♥. The DLCs each have a unique flavor and explore a different aspect of the Fallout theme - People who say that this game is not 'Fallouty' enough either A) have only played Fallout 3 (Morons) or B) Did not bother to really dig around the game (Fu*kheads) - A full playthrough, with all the DLCs and sidequests should easily run up into the 150-190 hour range, so ♥♥♥♥ off with your 'I've played this game 30 hours and I have an opinion' - no you don't, just shut up. Jerks.  Seriously, anybody who ♥♥♥♥♥alks this game is an idiot and if you don't play it Baby Jesus will cast you into a lake of burning fire to suffer for all eternity. Because Jesus loves you and wants you to be happy, or else.  That said, the game is buggier than bat guano. Some quest scripts are outright broken - quests will not trigger - In twenty some odd playthroughs (again, on console - the xbox version is the most stable of all three from what I can tell) I have never managed to finish every companion upgrade quest in a single playthrough. Idle NPCs say the same four lines ('Sometimes patrolling the Mojave makes you wish for a nuclear winter' omg just ♥♥♥♥ing kill me now) over and over despite there being a couple dozen in the game files apparently. You will see hundreds of Radscorpions stuck inside of the terrain in the course of a single playthrough. YOU will become stuck in the terrain a couple hundred times in the course of a single playthrough. Depending on your machine and the mods you are running, the game will crash to desktop, and even hard crash your system from time to time. Still, I scoff at your gamer cred if you can't grit through it. If you want a wart free experience, go get a Playstation you ♥♥♥♥in noob. Save early, save often.

It may just be me, but I usually take a long time to get to one town to another. Even though that's nothing too much, sometimes finding more ammo is tougher than it should be. Although that's the only bad things I've found playing, everything is just so unique and awesome. I like how when you equip a weapon, Vault Boy is shown with the gun in hand in your Pip-Boy which I feel is a particularly nice detail. The story is going nicely so far, I feel like the story ahead will be just as great. It engages me and it keeps me going and wants me to play more. Overall, I LOVE this game so far and if you have 10 or so dollars in your wallet, this game is a must have to put in your Library.",

Actuall ♥♥♥♥ing iron sights dude like for real no iron sights in fallout 3 ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off but this game has iron sights small thing but it makes a big diffrence for me 2. It feels like an actuall RPG unlike fallout 3 i mean this game has multiple endings and you can pretty much do everything by your choice and playstyle so pretty good stuff 3. Weapon mods ok so playing fallout 3 it annoyed me that i have to buy a silenced pistol instead of buying the silencer and attaching it to the gun but New Vegas fixed this thing and add Weapon Mods so ♥♥♥♥ is cash 4. The map actually feels not empty like for real fallout 3 felt so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ empty and i guess that ok seeing as the world surivived a nuclear appocalypse but FFS its been like 200 years there has to be some things around the world and new vegas had far more locations and backstory 5. All of the dlc is amazing i mean dude mothership zeta? ♥♥♥♥ is that? its the most stuipd dlc in fallout 3 however new vegas with honest hearts old world blues dead money and lonsome road it feels like the dlc fit in with the game so freaking good   In my personall opinion if you want a good rpg game choose this one for real you won't regret it",

Aside from combat and having to make moral choices it also provides cool minigames in casinos such as slots, blackjack and roulette really adding to the fantastic atmosphere and setting.

I then begin to play until I am able to make sure every mod has done what it is supposed to. After that, I uninstall everything.  Then the cycle begins anew.  Don't know why, maybe I like to subject myself to a weird sort of stress. It's like a challenge that no matter how much you are failing, the worst that could happen is that you stop your game from starting.

Such complete isolation... how could it not breed ignorance? Preservers of culture. Defenders of history. Cowards in basements. So excited they are that I travel openly. Drop the slightest hint that I'll assist their cause, and in two weeks I'm a member. They will not be missed.   When I enter their archive, they salute me. My visible disgust is taken as respectful intensity. It's a tight community. Everyone already knows how hard I've been fighting for them. Among the access panels in the archive sits a conspicuous red console. Right across the front of it in large letters: 'SELF DESTRUCT TERMINAL'. What? And the password is.... 'SECLUSIONIST'? A culmination of all the technology in the history of the human race and they didn't f*cking child proof the suicide machine.   Veronica. Would you mind heading back to the Lucky 38? I don't like leaving all that equipment unwatched for so long. I'll come meet you in a couple days. Thanks much. See you soon.  There's a little less foot traffic in the archive at 2am. No one's even in the rear chamber to watch me type it out. 'S-E-C-L...' Does the self destruct console come with sirens and flashing lights? Godd*mned right it does. Time to start running. Around the corner and through a pair of confused scribes. Up from the archive and past a wide eyed paladin. Only one person isn't in shock. Only one person is sprinting towards the exit. Paladin hands start going for weapons. My lab coat flutters like a cape. Turrets begin to wind up. Ramos is blocking the exit, wide eyed as the others. He begins to speak. I arm a frag mine across his face, and drop it at his feet before his body hits the floor.  The lab coat flies like the wind. The mine detonates, and three pursuing Brothers are robbed of their final 10 seconds. The earth purrs as I reach the surface. A deep, low, satisfied rumble that turns the ground to jelly and sinks my boots an inch into the sand.  I watch the entrance for a day, but a trickle of smoke is all that emerges.  One of my people is satisfied. But how to manage the other?  Veronica is... irritated. Do you know what happened? Were you there? Did you.... did you do it?  _ Barter [23/90]: Know anyone that's looking to buy some power armor? I got, like, twenty. _ Speech [65/90]: HELIOS One shoots lasers down from space! Maybe they were test firing and... &gt; [Lady Killer]: B*tch, please.   Veronica stays outside. Caesar grants only individual audiences. Typically this is an irritation, but given the topic of discussion, today it's a blessing. Yes, Caesar. The Brotherhood is no longer a threat. Your southern flank is clear.",

There is a lot to explore, a lot of missions, a lot of people to kill or help or help then kill. Loads of missions, and various groups you can join or destroy. Tons of mods for whatever you can think of adding or improving. I'm giving it around a six or seven but one day I plan on loading it and diving in, maybe with more time I would like it more but for now it is what it is.

I would recommend this game to pretty much anyone who liked Fallout 3, and maybe even Oblivion, they are pretty similiar, except for the settings.

And if you take the opposite approach and decide to be the jesus of the wastland, the rewards for doing so make you feel morally right. The story is deceptively shallow, what it does is let you imagin who you are, depending on the road you take, who you were changes.  Some where along your play through you might find a few drops in fps and missing textures that load a few seconds after you stare at it. It really stays true to its predisesor Fallout 3 while declaring its own mechanics.  For this game try not to make the 'perfect character' but rather one that you identify with. It feels alot more dramatic. Seeing that all around you have moral decisions. I mean the whole concept of the factions make the whole game complex if you put some thought into it. Of course, you can just go the hyper agressive route and kill everything that breaths and you would still have a lot of fun, I personaly ended some quest like this by accedentally shooting someone. &gt;.&lt; so if you do go down this road, remember don't kill the runners you might need the supplies.",

            "review_text": "Rating: 8.9/10.0 (Very highly recommended)  Obsidian Entertainment contains many of the original developers of the Fallout series, before the IP was sold to Bethesda in 2006.  In very much the same way that you would not allow anyone but J. R. R. Tolkien to write a sequel for the Lord of the Rings series, you should never let Bethesda write a sequel to the Fallout series.  What Fallout: New Vegas is; is the realization of Obsidian's dream to create Fallout 3: Van Buren. They might not have got the opportunity to make it as a 3D-isometric-turn-based game; but they did bring the world of Fallout to many fans who were 'seeped' in the novice pool by Bethesda's butchered pink-slime blender version.  For those of you who might be reading this in confusion and perhaps cringing:  In Fallout 1, you are the Vault Dweller, coming from Vault 13 - a vault designed to never be opened as a social experiment. The only reason the Overseer sent you out, is because the Vault's water purification system controller chip fried, and is impossible to replace. You fight Super Mutants, and discover the Brotherhood of Steel.  In Fallout 2, you are the descendent of the Vault Dweller, the Chosen One, sent out to find the G.E.C.K to help a tribal village from dying out due to drought, famine, and disease. You fight the Enclave.  In Fallout 3, Bethesda Edition, you are the Vault Dweller, coming from Vault 101, a vault designed never to be opened as a social experiment. You voluntarily leave to find your father, who is looking for a G.E.C.K, in order to activate a water purification system. You fight Super Mutants, the Enclave, and discover the Brotherhood of Steel.  Luckily, anyone who has played the Bethesda Edition is too young to remember the plots of Fallout 1 and 2, and probably has never played them; so upon discovering these concepts, thought that they were amazing and unique.  Needless to say, the difference between an Obsidian game, and a Bethesda game is as clear as day, as the difference between New Vegas and Fallout 3.  I highly recommend that you give New Vegas a playthrough, if not just for the story of NCR alone. It is direct canon to Fallout 2, makes many references to things that have occured in Fallout 1 and 2, and even has items and easter eggs directly from Fallout 2, if you know where to look. Big MT's story arc (DLC) is the canon ending from Van Buren, with Hoover Dam and Boulder City (formerly Boulder Dome) being the lead-up to it. The satelite weapon from Big MT however became HELIOS ONE.  E.g: Daisy Whitman in Novac comments on her experience as a Vertibird pilot that experienced a rotor malfunction over Klamath. ;)",

The game is pretty much sandbox, and you can go wherever you want. Only exception to this, is after you have finished the mainquest, because then the game is over, and you get one of the various endings.  BUT the best thing about this game, is how moddeable it is. You dont like a feature in the game? or think it lacks armor variation? Well then you just search the nexus or another mod site and they got pretty much everything you could ever want.

Alright, yes, the joke is that it's playing Fallout 2 to Fallout 3's Fallout 1. But unlike Fallout 2, the devs didn't either overreach themselves or just get incredibly lazy (I still can't tell which), and thus deliver an inferior product. Fallout: New Vegas arguably is a better product than Fallout 3, but, as I've said, it's less immersive and the atmosphere is less consistent. No, the Wild West's feel is the order of the day here (as is an increasingly elaborate and entertaining gun system), and though it's a lot of fun, it's probably a less engaging product than its predecessor. Still, get it right away. I'd probably put it put it just above Fallout 3, but, as ever, below Fallout 1.  By the way, I played the first 2 of the 4 DLCs at the time of writing, and they both offer up good weapons that you can keep at the end, as well as some fun stories and a lot of stimpaks and bobby pins, but not a lot else.  TL;DR It's a lot like Fallout 2 except less lazy, and it's Fallout 3's bigger, stronger, yet less somber big brother. Get it.  P.S. I killed the Brotherhood because they were old, sick, had outlived their purpose of trying to reconstruct society by giving technology to the worthy, and had to die. I'm really sad about it, but it had to be done.",

To paraphrase the plot you were shot by a leading of the strip for something you had and you live you are let out of the doctors house and you can know play how you wish and go in most directions and create you own story.As for the main story you the courier a man and/or woman who will change Vegas' future but you often aren't credited as you were in fallout 3 you seem more human because of this and the fact that with the correct options the gamed menus is harder that 3 but as with both of them mods make everything better.   The mod scene for vegas is one of the best as there is something for everyone like quest mods like new vegas bounties and overhaul mods like project nevada ,which makes the game seem more fleshed out and may have not been required if obsidion had sufficent time, The mods are often simple to install and also they are free but be warned the workshop has issues and you should use nexus and the mods for 3 are less advanced mainly because of the script extender being cripple because of the engine which is very unstable but obsidion polised the engine.And if the mod you want and can find it you can make on your self using the G.E.C.K.If you have probablems that aren't known about on the mod page you are probably at fault so read the read mes and the mod pages ect.    The game play is the same as 3 just with ironsights and a few other features.   The atomsphere is lesslike 3 mad max 50s mix and is closer to the orginals but in vegas and less descolate and more alive.Another war to look at it is that 3 was post apocalyptic the rest of them were post post apoclyptic meaning that the others are more about humanity picking up the pieces.    As for the dlc they aren't for everyone as somethings may not be to your taste but you should still get them because mods.   If you would like the game I would recommend wating until sales if they are close if not then buy it not perfrably the ultimate edition because of the dlc but you should buy it if it interets you if not then why are you reading this.",

Two, because I hadn't ever fully played out all of the DLC's (which I plan to remedy on this playthrough).  For those of you who don't know, Fallout: New Vegas is a first-to-third (over the shoulder ala Tomb Raider POV) post-apocalyptic RPG/Shooter. The setting is the southwest United States after a massive amount of bombs and time has elapsed. The world is in ruin and you've taken up work as a courier (think the Pony Express), except the story begins after you have been waylayed for your package. Upon waking up, you find yourself in the care of a kindly old doctor. He nurses you back to health and you begin anew in the wasted west.  Gameplay is pretty straight forward. The game plays a little easier to me to play in third person, although there are times that I switch over to FP to make a shot on someone. Your character is composed of Attribute stats as well as Skills and Perks. Attributes are core stats that affect percantages on things like To Hit, Critical Strike, or Carry Capacity. Skills add a direct bonus to the various types of things you can do in the game. Perks give your character a specialized flavor in the game as you level. Such things as better aiming ability, the ability to fix things better, or speeds you up in between actions. And speaking of actions, play is live, but action points recharge which ultimately power combat moves. This stays true to the entire series.  The game is full of interesting characters. Depending on how good your Speech is, you do or don't get a nice variety of different conversations out of the NPCs. There are even some NPCs that you can recruit to your cause. This is sometimes a good thing, sometimes not, in the game. One of my personal favorite followers is the droid that you can repair in a town not far from your starting point in the game.  One of the most useful aspects of the game is the VATS system. By hitting V on your keyboard, you bring up a hit location targetting system when in combat. It gives the percentage chance to hit different body parts on your enemies. This is great, since the game has different types of ammo for different situations (hollow points for unarmored targets or armor piercing for armored). In addition, shooting someone in their shooting arm may cause them to drop their weapon. Shooting someone in their leg may cause them to start limping. You can also just point and aim in live mode, but since the gun factors in your skill, the distance, and other random modifiers, you can miss even if you 'see' it as dead on in your sights.  There are other elements to the game that are enjoyable as well, including the crafting system. While rudimentary, it offers the ability to create simple concotions, drinks, food, and even armor and weapons. Travel is by foot, but once you discover a location, you can use your personal computer (called your 'Pipboy') to fast travel. Leveling up is fun, since you get skill points to spend and periodic points for new Perks.  I spent countless hours on the first playthrough, so I'm looking forward to reliving those times on this playthrough, plus seeing what all the DLC is about. I highly encourage buying the GOTY edition on this title to get all of the many extras that are in the game. It's fun, flat out and simple. Great game.",

A quaint little place home to soldiers, romans, cowboys, escaped convicts, fancy cannibals, and giant poisonous bugs. Everyone's going nuts over Hoover Dam (yes, the same hoover dam) because whoever controls THAT, controls all the power and water in the mojave. You can choose who gets the dam, OR! OR! OR you can take it for yourself. Yes, you heard me, you can become the undisputed lord/lady of Post Apocolyptic Las Vegas.  Going off the beaten path, which you can do any time, things get interesting. You get your brain scooped out by pre-war scientists (one of whom is voiced by Doctor Venture.) You get sent to a big scary casino with a bomb strapped around your neck that goes off near decaying radios (which that place has plenty of) to swipe all the gold bars out of pure spite (or just walk out with a laser sniper rifle/shotgun hybrid) You go to a beautiful national park and meet tribals lead by a mormon mummy to save two tribes from the genocidal whitelegs and get a war club. You go through the sand storms and ruins of the Divide to save the world from being nuked again. It's one hell of an adventure.   It's got companions! A nine foot tall blue supermutant who thinks she's your grandmother. A robot doggie with brain damage. A drunk cowgirl. Veronica. An NCR sniper. A snarky scientist. An old mexican ghoul and a round floating robot! I've god mods that can make the cute girl from Vault 21 gift shop a companion, and I think I have one that makes Vulpes Inculta into one too.  And speaking of mods? Forget about it. It keeps on going! Super mutant race mods, weapon mods, quest mods, performance enhancers, it just goes on and on!

The game mechanics aren't what Fallout 4's are but they are much better than Fallout 3 especially the actual iron sights and the companion wheel, seriously the companion wheel is the thing that was missing from Fallout 4, and I'm not kidding. The dialogues are written nicely, although you will notice the lesser quality compared to the voice acting in Fallout 4, but don't let that discourage you, because the writing is top notch.  The biggest 'plus' the game has are its DLC, my personal favourite is Dead Money because it combines horror and survival with a slight Silent Hillesque theme, with the 'cloud' replacing the fog from Silent hill. And the other DLC are great as well, some are funny as hell like Old World Blues and some are quite dark like Lonesome Road, but all of them are full of fun and more Fallout New Vegas when the main story just isn't enough for you.  If I were giving a numeric value to this game it would be a good 9/10 on its own, but 10/10 if you account for the fact mods can change anything you want in the way you want.",

(in my opinion) The game has some really slow parts that some people would call 'boring'. The 'slow' parts is when you wander the mohavi dessert to the nearest quest mark. I disagree, the wandering and exploration tells you allot about the story, motives and lore of this world that the fallout franchise take place in both visual and dialogue story telling which is absolutely brilliant.  Every faction in the game has a motive, theme and combat style which make every faction special and unique  The Ending was some of the most satesfying sh*t i have ever felt in a video game seriously  From begining to end this game was action packed, hilarious and over all an amazing experience  Sorry that the review was pretty rough because know one is going to read this sh*t",

Next thing I knew, I kept coming back to it over and over, and I became addicted to the game. I never got into Fallout 3 as much as this game, so it felt like a good change. I liked Obsidian's type of Fallout much more than Bethesda's. After sinking many days and eventually months of gameplay into the console version, I decided to experiment with the PC version. I decided to get the base game on PC just so I could save money and just play around with mods, try console commands, etc. I became addicted to both versions, as they seemed to have variety (not sure why), so I eventually purchased all of the DLC. Overall, this game took my wallet and constantly removed bills as I watched approvingly. I never regret a second of playing this game, and I still play it to this date.",

Even when you think you have done as much as you want to with the vanilla game, and you may want to go and find something else, you find an overhaul mod that drags you back in, you find something small that adds a feature you didn't even know you wanted until now.   Like many/all Bethesda games, upon release they will ♥♥♥♥ up, there will be more bugs than a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ tent in a field, and it will crash more than a three year old crashes their toy cars. Many of these may not be fixed, and unlike some I will not pretend this is part of the fun, it is ♥♥♥♥ing annoying. However, this is not a case of a lack of love or care. Obisdian were given essentially a year to make this game. And with that year, they produced in my eyes on of the best RPG games.  It is full of choices to make, reactions to your style of play, and endless oppotunities to role play. You can play anything from a psychopath who kills anything in their path because you want  to,  or you could spec yourself to talk yourself out of reaching danger, and run through any you  can't.  If you want to do something you most likely can. If not through the base game, then through the extensive mod collection.  I honestly believe this game should be played, and if there are issues search for a mod to fix it, it will be more than worth the effort.  (Both links are to youtube playlists.)",

Bloody and satisfying kills. Sights on guns make this game far better than Fallout 3. The added sights probably make this game better than FO3 by itself. Also, Fallout 3 had a gloomy atmosphere but in Fallout New Vegas, the world seems more alive, with fantastic factions, each with it's own uniquness. I find myself only gambling sometimes in New Vegas, and that alone is so much fun. I chose to purge and rob various casinos, although I spared some so I could still gamble. I accidentally killed all of the preformers, so I could not watch any shows in Vegas. Oh well. I love the different companions, each matching each style you prefer. I'm not a melee type of guy, but Veronica is the best companion in my opinion, giving massive hits from her power fist to your enemies. Don't settle with the first one you aqquire though, switch them out (you can have two at a time) and decide which ones you like the best. You don't have to be a sole bad guy or good guy, you can be both, changing your relationships with each faction. The game can be difficult at times, but after defeating hard enemies like deathclaws, it's very satisfying. Even then, you can always find the perfect weapon to defeat each enemy. Regarding the setting of the game, the Mojave Desert is the BEST location for this game. Every post-apocalyptic game (or even movie) could be in a desert. Especially the Mojave. There's nothing better than wandering through the Mojave in Fallout New Vegas with the in-game radio playing. Speaking of the radio, the song list is great. The Fallout series as a whole is very retro-futuristic, taking place in the late future with sci-fi weapons, while STILL having classic 1950s music. It's so great to blow an NPC's head off while Frank Sinatra sings in the background. If you get sick of hearing the same song a lot, have no fear because there are mods that allow you to make an organized playlist. Glitches are also enjoyable, having a nice laugh whenever a scorpion glides through rocks like a ghost. A deathclaw even froze one time, so I had fun teasing it by jumping around. Pretending to be a classic cowboy can be fun too, with your character only having revolvers, hat and maybe a lever-action rifle. I haven't played Fallout 4 so I can't compare and contrast the two games. That being said, if you are willing to only buy ONE rpg game or fallout game, make it this one. PS: I didn't mention gameplay with mods or DLC because this review is solely for the regular game.",

The combat in this game is a lot better to the combat in Fallout 3 as it is easier to fight things without using V.A.T.S(although I still do use it a lot as it's just fun).

With an amazingly deep and non-linear storyline (especially coming on the heels of the slightly more linear fallout 3), Fallout: New Vegas is ABSOLUTELY the best and most underrated fallout game in the modern franchise. if you had a choice between New Vegas and 4, buy new vegas! the modding community has added so much content that you could easily rack up 300+ hours playing. Wait for fallout 4 to gain some more mods and patches, and buy it when it drops in price. This is coming from someone who F04 and was majorly dissapointed.",

Except for the engine, models, and animations (and a few other things), but those are easily the worst parts of the game. Obsidian made a lot of improvements to New Vegas that place it above Fallout 3, storytelling being the greatest of them, but they also improved upon and added numerous gameplay aspects. Weapon modifications, iron sights for weapons, hardcore mode, all that good ♥♥♥♥. Granted, a lot of the additions were originally in FO3 with mods, but NV is still a lot more solid of a game than 3. They also mostly ditched Bethesda's horrible black/white 'morality meter' and introduced a much better faction-based reputation system. And the dialogue isn't written by elementary schoolers this time around. As for the bad, well... New Vegas has a VERY slow start. It doesn't help that the map is fairly linear (for a free-roaming game) with invisible walls and geological blockades such as mountains spread out everywhere that severely limit player progression in the beginning of the game. However, if you can tough it out through the first 5-10 hours of the game, you will be treated a very high quality RPG, and even a solid FPS if you can get some mods that un♥♥♥♥ the AI. Speaking of, make sure you mod this game. New Vegas has a lot of great mods that will amplify your experience in the Mojave, especially things like PN, IWS and WMX. Just don't enable more than 140 ESPs; Obsidian's silly monkey programming will ♥♥♥♥ your game to hell and back, even though Gamebryo games are supposed to have a hard-cap of 255. Obsidian have never been very good programmers, but it shows more heavily in NV than in any other game they've made before. This is one of the buggiest games I've ever played, even by Bethesda standards. Only the pile of ♥♥♥♥ that was Skyrim is more prone to crashing than this, and that's saying something. Now then, PLEASE ASSUME THE POSITION.",

Fallout takes your expectations and just breaks them, it takes all hope of social life outside of the game and destroys it. It is the ultimate gaming experience for me (so far).The plot was intense, the world was really freaking cool but also realistic despite having no basis in current scientific thought, and the quests ranged from morally repugnant to just plain silly. I loved it and if you don't like it I just don't know if we can be friends. Okay we can be friends but perhaps not BEST Friends.   Also the glitches are freaking hilarious.",

I used to live in Las Vegas when I was younger and walking in the mojave and the Strip in New Vegas felt very nostalgic to me with the long road trips and Neon lights. Now about the game. I consider this more true to the Fallout series than 3. Let's be honest here. Fallout 3 is good and I love it but the writing is fan fiction tier. Now Fallout: New Vegas stays true to the original games because of its setting and characters and the writing was just amazing and not a good vs evil ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like 3 did. Fallout: New Vegas has A LOT more weapons and rpg elements than 3 did and you don't feel like a invincible god like you did in 3. It's way more balanced and puts a sense of realism into it especially if you are playing on hardcore mode. The hardcore mode is a great addition for hardcore roleplayers and people who want a realistic approach and a challenge. The companions in my opinion were way better than fallout 3 and more memorable. My favorite companion is Rose of Sharon Cassidy for obvious reasons ;). I also loved the iron sights in this game and the option to mod your weapon to make it more powerful and accurate. Obsidian did a very good job for the animation and iron sights and makes you feel immersed when using it. The replayability in this game is insane! There are 4 different endings in this game but you can still play differently each playthrough and it never feels the same. The soundtrack in this game has got to be one of my favorite soundtracks ever, I'm talking about the radio. The mojave radio which consists of western/country music is so relaxing to listen to when you are out in the wasteland. If old western country ain't your thing then you can listen to Radio New Vegas which has swing music and legends like Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin. In conclusion, get this game. You will not regret a single penny. This game is art. It is the Mona Lisa and It deserves the praise it gets. I just want to thank Obsidian for making one of the greatest experiences I've ever had in gaming, you guys deserved to make Fallout 4 and have no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t due dates.",

            "review_text": "A game where you can have more than 500 weapons easily because of the mods. A game where you can create and have more maps/worlds because of the mods. A game where you can have more sort of enemies because of the mods. A game where you can have endless playtime because of the mods and of the game itself. A game where the people think they're good at but all they do is over using the VATS but if they would not use it at all they would fail hard and so the same could be said about the aim assist users. A game that has a good hardcore mode. A game that has some weird glitches that you'll never want to see (probably). But also a game that has a crappy engine and many flaws but it is still one of a gem.  And finally a game that you'll never get tired of if you play with mods, create your own stuff, play legitimately which means no cheats, no hacks, keep the game lore friendly, do not use the aim assist, do not use the vats, add some more difficulty into your games by using mods, add more creatures and content in your game, make it better in terms of gameplay, difficulty and visuals. And of course, you should be using 'A Tale of Two Wastelands' so you can play Fallout 3 in Fallout New Vegas.  Hey dawg, I heard you like Fallout so we put more Fallout in your Fallout.  Then and only then, you'll have yourself a rare gem.  Notice: use cheats and the vats are your own risk. It is more of a game breaking for me but to each his own.   Anyway, to get to the point, this is a gem, It is not Fallout or Fallout 2, It doesn't use the same engine nor gameplay, It's totally different but it's great, changes are not always bad, sure, we'd love to see a new turn-based Fallout game but we probably never will. There are some flaws such as the faction disguises, If you wear let's say a legion armor but you're a big friend of the NCR, the NCR will attack you on sight anyway, they can't recongize you, In real life, you'd tell them that you're in a disguise but in this game, you cannot do anything about it. There are some glitches here and there but it's playable. There are some World problems such as missing textures or misplaced stuff but nothing game breaking. It is a great game indeed but I would not see myself playing this without mods such as Weapon Mods Expanded, Enhanced Camera, Enhanced Blood, realistic bullets, realistic bullet damages, having more than 500 weapons of all sorts and that are of quality, more enemies and respawning enemies, better animations, etc etc... Also, you should use 'A Tale of Two Wastelands' if you own both Fallout 3 GOTY and New Vegas.  There are a few things that have always bother me in the Fallout and The Elder Scrolls games and two of them is, one: cleaving which means attacking multiple enemies at the same time with one melee weapon, you know... like real life. It's possible in almost every games that has melee weapons.  Second: bullet penetration in the Fallout games. If you shoot someone that isn't even equipped with an armor then It should penetrate him and hit the guy behind, considering that the gun is strong and that it uses strong bullets, the same could be said about covers such as sandbags, wood walls, fences, etc etc...  But after all of that, it is still a great game and a great RPG unlike Fallout 4, not a better shooter but that's okay, It's supposed to be mostly an RPG than a shooter anyway.  In the end, even if you would play without mods I'd still recommend this game but without mods, I'd give this game a 8/10, with mods I'm giving it 9.5/10    Edit: The engine is crap, we can barely make great animations for the weapons and there are so many flaws with the engine, this game would be the best game of all time if it would have a totally different and way better engine, no limits, we could be able infinite kind of animations and as much as we want, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. has great mods that adds awesome animations, heck, even the knife has custom animations that are so great. It would be cool to be able to use World War II weapons such as the Springfield, MP-40, MP-44 (StG-44), Panzershreck, etc etc... But it's impossible, the animations are all clunky and fu**ed up. Heck, having unique animations for each weapon, even the melee weapons. High quality and equal textures for all weapons and armors. Realistic sounds and all the other important stuff.  But most of that is impossible because of the limits this engine has and this is something that I hate a lot, the more the time passes, the more I hate it and the more I find it unacceptable to be that bad.  All what's left to do is to make a totally new engine or to upgrade the Creation Engine far above its level of the moment. I do hope that someday, we'll see a remake of Fallout: New Vegas and Fallout 3 (perhaps both in the same game kind of like A Tale of Two Wastelands did) on a way better engine. That would simply be epic.   Note: Unfortunately, the dolby sound 5.1 is not compatible with this game, even if you emulate it, it won't works, it will do the same as the other Fallout and The Elder Scrols titles, there will be sounds missing and there is nothing you can do about it as far as I know.   This game was made by Obsidian, so of course it is good, Obsidian may not be perfect but at least they have some talent, they some times work with modders to make their game and they give them the rights they deserve, nothing like Bethesda who ain't giving a single **** about anything but money, I seriously do hope that Bethesda will bankrupt soon enough and that Obsidian will get the rights of Fallout and The Elder Scrolls again, the rights of Wolfenstein, Quake, Doom and the other games should go to another great developer/publisher.",

Finally these years of not having two sniper rifles and a laser gun and a sort of laser gun and a knife and another knife and a gun and another gun and another sniper rifle in my pockets was no more. The game was pretty standard: the goal of the game is to steal absolutely everything without getting caught because if you get caught then you get shot by The Man and then you lose all your guns. The winner of the game is whoever has stolen most of the things by the time France nukes Taiwan or something (i had a little nap during the intro sequence so i missed some of it but still managed to catch the end so i think i'm okay). The kleptomania game was not all thievery fun and kleptomania games, as there were some problems such as guns you had to buy which you couldn't steal and also people who would kill you when you tried to steal the guns which in my mind i don't know why such a major design flaw was introduced to the game. My biggest problem with New Vegas is that they called the game and also the city New Vegas (what a coincidence!) when the city is built on top of the old Vegas so they're not even trying. This is like building New York on top of York or New London on top of London or New Zealand on top of Zealand or New Amsterdam on top of Amsterdam or all of them at the same time. This might sound like a good idea because you can tell tourists that your city is brand new and shiny but it could get out of hand because what if you redo your city lots of times over the years then you will have to put lots of New in front of the city name and then they're probably need to make new words for multiples because otherwise it wouldn't fit on letters and not to mention all the ink you'd use trying to write all those news would probably cause oil and ink resources run out fifty years early. Also what constitutes new i mean if i put like twenty skyscrapers in the city is probably new but what if it's just a park or maybe someone just redecorated their room? The developers obviously did not think this through so i will have to give this game a solid 7/10 but they need to work on their geography.

            "review_text": "While this was enjoyable, and the DLC felt better written than the Fallout 3 DLC, overall it was smaller in many ways, and a disappointment having played it directly after FO3. 3 was a larger world, and had more to do in that world, when you found a location, chances were it had one to two levels above ground and possibly quite a large dungeon or sewer system, and was loaded with loot. NV had emptyville, population nobody, and nothing, often not even a tin can...town after town of cowboy movie sets, with no actors, windows and doors all boarded up. I ran into a random gang of mad max type goons once, about seven or eight came at me out of nowhere and I thought ok, this is going to be good, bigger groups to fight. that was unfortunately quite rare.   The changes to the economy from 3 were also quite jarring, suddenly everything costs an absolute fortune, repairing some pretty average combat armour cost me 11,000 caps...come on now, in 3 you could buy several sets of power armour for that and still have change for a fatman. I brought a tri beam laser rifle off a travelling merchant, with a mod, all up best part of 8,000. it was a really underpowered weapon compared to the plasma defender or grenade launcher or even a 10mm machine gun.  Food used to be a good sale item, no longer, meds, used to be worth picking up, no longer, even enemy armour and weapons are way more trouble to cart around than they are worth. Best thing I can say is do the Big Empty DLC as soon as you can because you will get a cool base with a really valuable shop you can fast travel to immediately, and you can turn all the burned books and empty bottles into more valuable treasure there as well. It makes carting junk around much less of a hassle if you can just beam there and dump it off right away.  I think I ended up exploring more of the wasteland than I was meant to because I couldnt find a way inside Vegas itself for a long time, but that paid off once you start getting a few of the 'world tour' type of fetch quests going to a list of places you have already unlocked is a lot less painful than having to slog all over the map on foot from the closest fast travel point. Once you get inside Vegas itself, the actual story picks up and the fun comes back into the story a little so if thats the last part you do, it will end on a high point, but if you get there too early you will sort of get a bumrush to the end of the story and miss a lot of the side quests, some of which were not half bad.  I would also suggest thinking about what your goals are as you can end up doing a mission and closing off A LOT of other potential storylines. I thought I'd see what happened if I did X, and next thing you know I've failed about six quests in a row, some of which I hadnt even started, and my reputation got all broken too, suddenly the gang I had completely massacred liked me more than the NCR who one mission before had idolised me, now they were just ok.....so plan where you want to end up is all I'm saying.  Is this a good game....yeah, I guess. Is it as good as Fallout 3 like everyone says...I really dont know how that became the favoured answer, theres less to do, and way less at stake. Oh and the music which was so awesome in 3, well you get bugger all, I had heard johnny guitar and Big Iron about a thousand times each and thats no exaggeration. Mr New Vegas is a poor substitute for threedog.  Buy it cheap, play it once and thats enough really.",

You'll spend hours wailing on giant insects, mutated creatures, oh and people that want to kill you for star bottle caps. I swear the bartender in goodsprings tried to steal my star bottle caps, so I punched her head off and then everyone in the bar started trying to steal them.. needless to say, they didn't get them.. heheh...  There's plenty of skills to level up, which of course are required to pick higher level doors or wield weapons efficiently. You can also raise these skills with skill books scattered around the wasteland which increment the skill by 3 or 4. The ones that raise them by 10 are a lie; they're temporary to give you an edge. Plus you get perks every few levels that make you even more awesome.  One of the improvements was with the karma system. Aside from the basic Good, Bad, and Neutral, you now have split karmas with different factions such as the NCR and power puff gangers. You can either make these groups idolize you as their god, or hate and fear you like you're the devil.   One of the other notable improvements was being able to add modifications to your weapons, such as a silencer or a scope. This is one of my personal favorites, because you can customize the weapon however you want when you find a mod. My only gripe was the lack of a naming feature for the weapons, because I wanted to name my power fist 'Rock 'em Sock 'em'.  Now if you'll excuse me.. I'm going to go back to punching things into bloody messes and hauling items back to my hoard.",

            "review_text": "Fallout: New Vegas  Pros:  - Massive amount of content. As far as content:price ratio, this is an amazing value for your money.  - The side quests and storylines of some of the Vaults are a lot of fun to investigate and discover. I actually enjoyed the side quests a lot more than the main plot simply because the main plot wasn't all that creative.  - The enviornment with regards to the areas around Vegas (Hoover Dam, Nellis, etc.) is spot on and fun to explore.  - The Sound track is phenomenal. This is one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard in a game. It fits the theme and enviornment so well.  Cons:  - I was disappointed that the 'main character' (aka you) has no real personality. You make choices through the game, but there is no sense of character. I suppose YOU are the character and your personality is the one playing the game, but I would have much more preferred an actual written character to make choices for. How is there supposed to be a story without a fully developed main character? This is one of the games major pitfalls.  - I didn't personally find the main plot line all that interesting. Whenever I ran out of side quests I would be sad to have to go back to the main plot... The side quests were way more fun.   - Exploring and getting to certain areas can become EXTREMELY tedious. There are so many impassible terrains that you are generally forced to take very long routes in order to get to some places that seem like they are easy to get to. It's very deceiving.   - The main plot has a ton of choices for you to make. Unfortunately, I felt like there were so many choices that I became overwhelmed and had no clue what to do. I personally like to finish all quests that I am given. You can't do this approach in New Vegas though because once you choose sides of a certain faction, you risk failing all the missions for their opposition. This is frustrating to someone who wants to see all the content. You would have to make multiple playthroughs or very specific save points in order to see all the content. I would have much preferred no faction oppositions and just the ability to do all the quests.  Overall, the game content is quite solid and has one of the best sound tracks I've ever heard (seriously, I keep singing those songs in my head even when I'm not playing the game - they are a part of me now). Unfortunately, its biggest pitfall is the lack of a main character and a boring main plot. The gameplay is solid, but I don't quite see the hype some other reviewers are giving it.  8/10",

There are more weapons available here than there were in Fallout 3, and a overhaul of the crafting system. With this there are plenty of styles to approach the wasteland with. Gunslinging cowboy, disciplined soldier, or high tech future killing machine. Up to you. And last to mention is the speech system. I always preferred Fallout's speech system over Elder Scroll's for it's realism and use of lines. It's mostly unchanged. Except when talking to companions. When talking to the companions, no slow lines of dialouge to steam through for simple things like 'Wait here', the companion wheel speeds it up immensely, making a companion something you will have with you all the time.

Little tricky to get them all working unlike skyrim at this point in time but in the end, if I can figure it out, you can.  Cons:  1. The last mission actually ends the game permanently, unlike fallout 3. So if you're going to play FNV you should save frequently. 2. Graphics are dated at this point, mods can help with this. 3.

Bethesda's writers are incompetent hacks that couldn't write themselves out of a broom closet and the vast difference between 3 and NV despite their surface elements appearing so similar really shows how great of a game FNV is. It still has most of the vanilla gameplay problems of F3, though some have been alleviated, but if you're a fan of the series this game is a must have.   It's a shame that Bethesda tried so hard to mess with FNV's release by pushing forward deadlines, rejecting milestones, and refusing to playtest the game, but in the end we still ended up with an amazing game. To those who don't know, the reason Bethesda did that to Obsidian was to attempt a hostile takeover like they did with Dishonored, Call of Cthulu, and catastrophically failed to do with Prey 2. I would have loved to play these games in a world where they didn't get sabotaged by their publishers, especially New Vegas.  Make sure you play with NVAC and Project Nevada for the full experience, though there's plenty of other good mods for it too but I think that those two are all but required.",

All of the DLC, and mini quests even were all very enjoyable, such a wide variety of ♥♥♥♥ to collect and do that you can put a solid 100 hours into one character without the addition of mods. Fallout is such a good game, but they really took a ♥♥♥♥ on my chest when it comes to the ending. Now I know a lot of people say that 'Oh I prefer it this way', and then other people say 'It's better this way', but the ending to Fallout New Vegas sucked donkey ♥♥♥♥, mmk. I had so many plans, I was going to discover every area in the game and complete every quest available prior to the ending, but you know what they did instead of let me do that? They gave me the option to revert to a pre-hoover dam battle save, or return to the main menu never allowing me to continue that character from the end of the game on. Finding out that there was no free-roam really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off, regardless the game is very fun, but hey at least it doesn't give you a worse ending than Skyrim's. I suggest doing everything you want to do with the game pre end game cause you wont get to do it again, enjoy the game, and don't try to 'experiment' with fisto.... please.   ",

The game doesnt have a unique expierence like all the other fallouts, its more bland and boresome with the surroundings and questline So it is more like a explore everything and your done with the game  2.) The DLC is really bad, I played all fallout3 DLC when they came out and i knew about them like weeks before so i got it early, but with new vegas it just isnt the same because instead its the same boring thing all over again  3.) The whole atmosphere is ♥♥♥♥, i mean who gives a crap about nevada? No offense if you live there but you have to agree that THERE IS NOTHING and i mean NOTHING out there except for casinos but i mean even in the strip it still didnt seem big enough then the actually vegas.  Over all i give this a 3/10 for bad BUT I still recommend it because it still keeps you occupied and if your a lover of fallout then you will HAVE TO PLAY THIS whether its good or bad.  Sorry but in basic summary of it all, new vegas isnt even the Fallout 4 we were looking for. Fallout new vegas is more of like a side story taking place the same time as fallout 3... and that is what its intended to be.",

What I liked: +There's more weapons than in fallout 3.-- The addition of more weapons expands on what kinds of builds can be useful as you are leveling up. Although I will argue the game added too many weapons, which takes away some of the value that some weapons had from fallout 3. In other words, whereas one weapon was highly coveted before, now you can pick 1 of 4 weapons and be just as well off. Either way I see this as a plus.  +The faction system is a welcome addition to how you deal with groups of people -- It's a bit of a wonly feature, but it's nice to be able to build love/hate relationships with various groups in the wastes.  What I didn't like:  - There's a bit too many people, taking away some of the atmosphere that fallout 3 had. -- In fallout 3 there was a level of atmosphere added by the feeling that you were almost alone or that there weren't many people. Now however, it feels like you're never alone and that there are people everywhere. This creates a different feeling, which is for me, not as good as the original  - A lot of 'filler' quests. -- I can't tell you how many quests make you go and just talk to a guy, who tells you to talk to another guy, just to talk to another guy. The kicker, most of these guys involve fast traveling and forcing you to walk 3 miles to get to them. Really ruined my experience some days.  Despite some of the over-saturation of poor quests and bugs, I still recommend this game, just don't expect it to be as good as the original.",

            "review_text": "Fallout New Vegas is a great game, and I would recommend it to anyone: 8/10  That is just something I wanted to get out of the way before starting on what might seem as a predominantly critical review. Because though great, NV also missed an even greater opportunity to be one of the greatest. Perhaps being great as it is, makes some of its flaws all the more stinging. When I first started this game, I was overwhelmed:  - the open world - the diversity - the dialogues - the quests, not in the least the main quest - the choices - the companions and companion interaction - the survival aspect (playing on hardcore) - the overall atmosphere - the gunplay, being able to use both VATS and classic iron sights  Wow, just wow. This was great. Then came the second half of the game though:  - you suddenly notice every companion has the same routine of reluctantly offering you a quest for an upgrade, then afterwards the interaction falls completely flat - the world is open, but also relatively small, and you are steered quite strongly in a certain direction by means of e.g. very high tier enemies blocking shortcuts - survival comes down to simply chucking a seemingly endless supply of grilled squirels, even though the animals themselves are nowhere to be found (maybe because everybody eats them) - while you are still able to use VATS at higher levels, there is absolutely no reason to, as manual aiming is 200% more effective - around level 15, I pretty much stopped caring about what was happening in Vegas at all, because I allready was the king of the hill. As there are no stat or training restrictions on companions, even if you did not do very well for yourself skill or perk wise, with a laser sputnik and cowgirl in space marine armour throwing around nukes on your side, you do not even really need a weapon to begin with - the second half of the MQ is just on rails, though the rails might be cleverly concealed under some radioactive tumbleweeds. 'Get minor factions A, B, and C on your side', 'Go to X to do Y for either A, B, C', etc. In the end you are still going to X to do Y whatever choice you made. Some of the quest routes are in fact the exact same because route K does not have a designated choices, so you have to pretend to follow route L - the bugs,.. oh god,.. the bugs. The bugs basically went to the point that the last part of the MQ is totally unplayable without the console and a wiki or a walkthrough. I do not mind if a certain quest route is blocked by choices I (unknowingly) made prior, but I do mind if I miss out on fun game content because an essential NPC got run over by a two headed cow while I was binging whiskey at the other side of the world map. That is five years after release, without any mods or DLC's!  In conclusion I have to again emphasize that this game is great and that this game is fun, hence the frustration when for example a bug makes you miss out on some of it. However, there is also no denying the sheer quality difference between the first and the second half of the game, and that what we got was a rush job. Obsidian developped, had to develop this game in 18 months, and what they delivered can be called staggering. Where they failed it was due to the unrealistic expectations set by their own ambitions, which could be considered both commendable and painfull. It is painfull that this game never became what it should have been (though perhaps never could have been), but it still became better than most of anything else.",

You need to mod it to the hilt in order for it to be semi stable, and even then its basically a die roll, and you will spend at least 50% of your time in the console fixing broken quests or recovering glitched items or killing glitched enemies or resetting glitched NPCs, which is the worst part.  And the base game is also pretty garbage if we are honest. The acting is terrible the level design is terrible the gameplay is okay, or at least would be if it didnt glitch out constantly.   But then the DLC is a whole other world, its crazy. No one in the main game can act, the DLC is full of well acted (if not well written) parts. Everything in the main game is a greyish brown flat with the occasional copy pasted building, the DLC varies from poisonous ghost towns to incredibly well done depictions of a nuked city, complete with essentially caves and new structures created by falling skyscrapers. And the DLC level design understands how there is a third dimension, you can use high variances to increase the potential gameplay, which is incredible coming from the main game.  And the gameplay is incredibly well thought out, Dead Money for instance is a pretty good survival horror. Or as another, Lonesome road establishes a mechanic where you can selectively modify the environment, which is great.   Its wierd, I would have expected the DLC to be worse than the game, but it is damn night and day. Why couldnt the base game have been as good as the DLC?!",

That said, and if you can look past its many bugs, glitches and crashes, Fallout: New Vegas can be a great time sink, especially if you, like me, enjoy experimenting with all possible outcomes from the decision-making system throughout dozens of quests - which will lead you to find out that, in the Mojave Wasteland, there's no such thing as Good and Evil, there are only shades of gray...",

Ingredients:  1 cup digestive plain sweet biscuit crumbs 3 tablespoons sugar 3 tablespoons melted butter 40 ounces softened cream cheese 1 cup sugar 3 tablespoons flour 1 tablespoon vanilla 1 cup sour cream 4 eggs  Directions: For The base:. If you're using a dark pan, preheat the oven to 350. If you are using a shiny pan, 375. Combine the crumbs, melted butter and 3 tbsp sugar well and pat onto the bottom of a 9 inch springform pan. I also like to very very lightly butter the sides of the pan so that the cheesecake will not stick later on. Bake for 10 mins in your preheated oven and remove. Let it cool while you prepare your batter. For the batter:. Make sure everything is at room temperature. Combine sugar, cheese, flour and vanilla in a big bowl and mix on medium speed till well combined. Don't forget to scrape the bowl as you're doing this. Mix in the sour cream till its incorporated well. Then, add the eggs one by one, mixing well after each addition. Pour the batter into the springform and let it bake for 1 hour and 10 minutes After the baking time, turn off the oven and leave the door ajar. Let the cake cool in there for about 1 1/2 hours. Remove the cake and let it cool thoroughly. Refrigerate overnight. Release the sides of the springform. Eat.",

Not Perfect.So it does not recive a Perfect score.Sound quality followed Pefectly.Weapon design looked Very Good.Not Perfect.Very low resolution.Weapon damage seemed off where a Gun out damages a Laser.Poor Rating.Forcing players to resort to Guns.Now we come to a feature in the game mechanics.This was by far the worst example in Weapon and Armor utilizations.This also falls under the same as Repair and Repair Cost.When you take an item to be repairs it cost a forture and is only repaired by 7% to 30% for $1000 to $9000 (Caps).Weapons can be used on average 10 to 83 times if not repaired to fully repaired.After that it brakes.This is stupid.Weapons do not brake on use in real life.So why would anyone say your weapons work like they were put together out of chewing gum.You fight 6 fights an it becomes completely useless.  I know old war weaposn that works perfectly fine that have been sitting in mud for over 74 years.This was a bad idea an i recommend Modding something into the game to stop this.Restore items to full an you will enjoy this game much more.This is the only game i would recommend Modding a game that needs it.",

Playing all the main series Fallout games Fallout New Vegas is a return to it's roots in the original two games. Fallout New Vegas plays almost exactly like Fallout 3 with the additon of iron sights on weapons, which if you prefere not to use can be disabled. There was also a crashing problem which cursed the earlier patchs of the game. This is mostly worked out but the engine may destablize if you enjoy modding your game.  The main storyline of Fallout New Vegas isn't too interesting. The story starts with the player being shot and burried in a shallow grave in the desert. By chance your survive, thanks to a robco securitron and a wastleland doctor, and set off in a quest for revenge which in turn causes you to be recognized by all the major fractions in the area causing you to be the man/women on the frontline in the coming war. This story isn't as interesting to play as it may sound however, but thats not what we're here for. You can play for over 200 hours on a single charter in the ultimate edition and still not beat the game once because of how many things there are to do. The quests and story can have a decent sense of moral ambiguity, which is one of the things I really enjoyed in the older Fallouts. The player is also given a greater feeling of choice and impact through having more options of how to deal with situations and having a greater veriaty of people in the Mojave desert.  I am also willing to factor mods into this review due to people making the intallation of them being as easy as a download and a few clicks. The Fallout modding community has created amazing quests and adventures that I feel do nothing but benefit the game. Just be careful with mods because it may destablize and already sensitive engine.",

            "review_text": "Obligatory header to the review: I focus on four primary areas whenever I review a game: gameplay, story, graphics, and sound/audio/general things that go into your earholes. Gameplay and Story get a rating scale from 1 to 10, and the AV stuff gets a rating from 1 to 5. My philosophy on this is that there are some instances in which a game may not necessarily have that much in the way of gameplay (take Amnesia for example), but the story/atmosphere/whatever it may be is reason enough to pick it up. Also, take the cumulative score with a grain of salt; it's just a numerical feeling about the game as a whole. That's part of why I do these subscores. Also, keep in mind that I'm not going off of school grade based rankings. A 5/10 denotes what I feel to be an average game. Likewise, 7/10 is a game that I think is pretty cool, and something that gets a 2/10 is near-abomination level. Pinning scores to an even further obfuscated rating scale is kinda senseless, but for the sake of my backloggery, I'll repeat again that 1.0-2.7 is a one-star game, 3.0-4.7 is a two-star game, 5.0-6.7, 7.0-8.7, and 9.0-10 are three, four, and five stars, respectively.  Additional Note: I'm reviewing the Ultimate Edition of the game, so I will be talking about the DLCs in this review.  Gameplay: If you're reading this, odds are that you already know something about the modern iterations of the Fallout series. If not, they're a hybrid FPS and RPG that actually works, unlike a lot of other games that try that design direction. Skill shooting is definitely rewarded and is very much welcome after my not so great experience with Borderlands (seriously, 600 bullets to the head from an SMG won't kill an enemy because NUMBERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!1), with repeated strikes to limbs crippling enemies, causing various ailments. While the system in this game is nowhere as deep or multi-faceted as 'true RPGs' like The Witcher or anything else like The Witcher, I do enjoy a streamlined apporach to action-y RPGs. Otherwise, it just gets in the way and you end up shooting 600 bullets into the head of an enemy and only end up doing about 1/3 of their health because your weapon doesn't have the appropriate numbers to counteract the enemy's numbers so your numbers (in health) get reduced until your other numbers (lives) gets reduced to zero. NUMBERS!!!!!!!!!!1  Of course, since this is a Fallout game, combat isn't always the most important aspect of the gameplay. It's important, but it's not stealing the spotlight. Exploration is a huge facet of the game as well, and there is a lot to explore here. If it weren't for my backlog of games, I'd probably spend another 60 hours exploring the wastes. Unfortunately, there are invisible walls placed sometimes in places where they make no sense whatsoever and can make exploring somewhat of a pain. I don't remember any of that happening in Fallout 3, but it has been a few years. Most of the time you can cut your own path through the wasteland and not have to worry about it, but it does happen from time to time and it can be rather frustrating.  One of the things that I noticed while playing through the game was that it didn't seem like it felt as profound as Fallout 3's adventure. Then, when I was thinking about it during one of my many restless nights (*shakes fist at insomnia*), I realized why it was: the game is just offering choice. Choice that I don't recall being present in 3 (other than a last minute ultimatum, of course). Your choices do actually have some impact on what goes on at the end, with certain choices pleasing some while stepping on the feet of others. It really does help the game feel that much more alive, and even though it may not feel as grand an adventure as Fallout 3's, the choice you have (with regards to everything, really) is a much more welcome addition than just a longer journey.  Alright, let's talk about the DLC. Play Old World Blues; skip the rest. If you really haven't been sated by Old World Blues, play Lonesome Road. Dead Money (Sierra Madre Grand Opening) is just abysmal and predicated upon a really flimsy plot device that essentially removes every aspect of player choice given to you throughout the game. Honest Hearts starts on an escort mission, so I didn't even bother continuing beyond that introduction. At least I was able to finish Lonesome Road, even if Deathclaws ruined my day by being honestly really OP for the area. Old World Blues is simply fantastic, though, and includes something that made me really happy at the end: A BOSS FIGHT! This game doesn't actually have any boss fights, which was incredibly disappointing for someone who likes boss fights, but at least Old World Blues brought one.   Overall, I had a lot of fun with this game, and while I don't think the Dead Money or Honest Hearts DLCs are that great, they're not enough of a reason not to pick up the Ultimate Edition of this game. Old World Blues is more than good enough of an addition to make it worthwhile, as well as some of the more minor DLCs. 8/10.  Story: Much like I talked about in the Gameplay section, the biggest difference between this and 3 is that this one offers a lot more choices as to how the story goes. Admittedly, not all of these choices have necessarily profound consequences, but they do at least change the world in some minor way. Also, choosing the fate of New Vegas isn't necessarily as grand or impacting a choice as the big decision in 3, but again, the element of choice is what brings this game to par with 3. The writing for the main game is still great and the main characters are all believable, flawed, and rife with their own agendas for the fate of New Vegas.   Again, I'll dedicate a paragraph to the DLCs. Old World Blues is overall quite alright, if a bit groan-worthy with its tongue-through-cheek-and-through-another-person's-cheeks humor. Plus, that DLC has the world's longest expository dump. No seriously, it took about 30 minutes of dialogue to get to actual gameplay in Old World Blues. So yeah, that wasn't the greatest. Lonesome Road was... kinda pretentious, honestly. It tried to do the Spec Ops thing where- actually, you probably know about that. At least ED-E was adorable throughout. As mentioned earlier, I abandoned ship on Dead Money since the whole basis of the game was really flimsy and the one character I met (God aka Dog. Yeah, we get it, guys) really wasn't all that interesting. Honest Hearts didn't grab my attention enough with the opening scene; it might be good, but everyone kept dying, so I didn't bother anymore.   Overall, the writing for the main game may not be as grand of an adventure as the prior games, and the writing in the DLCs can be... not so great at times, but that element of choice more than makes up for it. 8/10.  Graphics: This is gonna be another one of those games that may not look so great in ten or so years. It looks good enough now, but I have a feeling that looking back, this game will look about as good as Quake 2 on the N64 does today. However, to be brutally honest, an art style isn't the biggest culprit for what makes this game look not so great at times. It's the technical aspects. For starters, there is a RIDICULOUS amount of pop-in, with one of the most noticeable examples being whenever I looked down the sights for a pistol, my left hand took a half second to render. Also, many objects in the wasteland pop in at a relatively close range, even with all settings maxed out. There's also some texture clipping as well, specifically with some not-so-subtle clashes of fake environment skyboxex and actual environment models. It kinda ruins the atmosphere seeing a hill in the distance flicker like a rave. The game does run fine on my GTX 760 at 1080p Ultra settings, but I just wish they had spent some more time working on the technical aspects of the graphics engine. 2/5.  *apparently I've ran out of space, so I'll continue in a comment. First time that's happened.*",

The game runs just fine on almost anything, and if the graphics seem a little bit dated the moddding community has created numerous graphical improvements for the game. I have played 60 hours of this game and am still going strong. The main story line is very very short and can be completed in only a few hours, but this game is more about exploration and taking up side quests. Since the reputation system has made a return you now have a reason to replay this game at least 3 or 4 times just to see what different reputations with different communities are like. Also, when you finally exaust all of the Vanilla content there are 4 packs of quest DLC which will give you plenty of extra playtime. After you blast through all of that then you are left with the amazing modding community that alone has ammounted for more than half of my playtime. Now there are a few cons with this game. The biggest one would be that the engine is terrible and you will have quite a few crashes every now and again, but like the rest of the problems with this game mods have fixed the majority of issues will be fixed. So in all I would have to say that if you are looking for a good sequel to Fallout 3 or any of Interplays original Fallout titles that won't be found here. However if you are looking for a great rpg with tons of replayability and content than this game is for you.",

Bet on Mr. House. Or, want to rule everything yourself with an army of death robots? Yeah. You can do that. Throw in weird crazy superheroes and random, oftimes whacky events, and you got a brilliant way to kill days if not weeks of your time.  But most of all, I love the pure adulterated freedom of New Vegas. Be good, bad, or anything in between; but you can always rely on New Vegas for a great place to visit, relax, and have a bit of fun.

Now New Vegas I had a problem with at first because it felt to different from Fallout 3 (to me it did), and also I played it on release so I experienced a lot of bugs and crashes, the first time I played it I played the NCR rout thinking that was the best one, the truth was I felt empty afterwards, I felt like I didn't accomplish anything, and the only DLC I had for it was Dead Money and Honest Hearts, I wasn't impressed with them. So flash forward years later and I buy this game on sale, I let it sit in my library for a while until I feel like shooting it up, I decided to go the Wild Card rout this time, and taking that rout changed my whole perspective of this game, I met many of the interesting factions, I did more interesting side quests, what New Vegas succeeded at the most was that Role-Playing, yeah for a RPG it gets the Role-Playing spot on, every side you choose has a consequence, you can change how companions think, it's fantastic. The gameplay also improves a lot from Fallout 3 as well, having iron sights without having to install mods, having weapon mods, different ammo, it really does help. I've played through Dead Money again and I learned that it was a DLC trying to be different from other DLC's, you're supposed to feel weak and helpless in it, even with a high level character, Honest Hearts looks fantastic in my opinion, as someone who went to Zion once I have to say, they nailed down the atmosphere, and the Burnt Man's tale is simply incredible writing, possibly the best writing in the entire game. I've yet to play the rest of the DLC (Old War Blues, Lonesome Road) but I can say that I'm very excited to play them! In my past reviews with Bethesdia games I always mention the mods, and while NV has amazing mods I don't think that should be enough to judge a game, you judge a game on how it was originally made. Overall I've grown to love New Vegas, possibly more than Fallout 3, while Fallout 3 is still an amazing game I feel like New Vegas gets everything right, it fixes any problems Fallout 3 had and adds more, the game isn't trying to be Fallout 4, it's trying to be a spin off of Fallout 3 while improving.

Fallout III. Fallout NV. All these games are awesome! The DLC's lead off of many things. Old war tech. New world tech. More storyline adding to the already made storyline. Compainions. Its a game with many things. Yes. It is good. Always good. The bugs are not that recent. Those people who over exxagerate their bugs are annoying. Such as the one person in the 'Only negative' Side, said 'I got hit by a deathclaw, and the developers said 'No, Pain is just too easy' And I flew off into space' That is over exxagerating. When you get hit, you dont fly into space. That would only happen if a mod or some kind of, well, yeah mod was configuring with the game files. It should've been him saying that he fell. Not flew. The mod's. The stuff. Its all cool. Its all Good. This game is better than Call of duty, battlefield, Outlast, All those games you guys may feel are good. You may feel they are good, but if you try this, and complete the game, not use cheats, not mess around, Well, maybe allitle, then you'll see the beauty of this game. It is the top best seller game of the world. I would say. Just because the game is old, not that good graphics, or anything doesent matter. If you think graphics is gameplay, then go f!ck yourself. I could take this game even if it was a retro game. If it had retro graphics. If there were no dialog. It doesent matter. So how about all you hater's that have only played for like 0.1 hours. 0.4 hours. 2 hours. 4 hours. On my other account, I played for about 300 hours. You can say I dont have a life.

I bought it for £40 on the first Day for PS3 as well. I actually felt like playing Fallout again, so thought now was the perfect time to buy it. Never played the DLC's before, so this is a new experience for me. Which lead me to another subject, I completed Lonsome Road, which is the fourth and last DLC for the game that is seen to some as 'The end game' as you have the choice to either blow up NCR, Caesar, or both. I'm stuck on what to pick, haha. Nethertheless, I will still continue to play the game regardless of what choice I pick. Even though I'm literally at the start of the game. I haven't even discovered Caesar's base or New Vegas. That's how early I completed Lonsome Road. Started it at Level 5 and now completing it, I'm Level 12. Ulysses was a pain to kill, but I end up getting him into a glitch, which cause me to not being able to obtain his loot. :( Doesn't matter though, he didn't have anything over the top amazing though. Haha. Looking forward to continue this game! Hoping this will be the first time I've ever seen a Fallout Game to the end. I already have 20 hours invested into it and have only owned the game for 4 days now! And out of those 4 days, I've only played 4#3 Days worth. :)  One downside though is that there's quite a few bugs and glitches in the game, but don't let that discourage you! This game is a must!",

Playing all the main series Fallout games Fallout New Vegas is a return to it's roots in the original two games. Fallout New Vegas plays almost exactly like Fallout 3 with the additon of iron sights on weapons, which if you prefere not to use can be disabled. There was also a crashing problem which cursed the earlier patchs of the game. This is mostly worked out but the engine may destablize if you enjoy modding your game.  The main storyline of Fallout New Vegas isn't too interesting. The story starts with the player being shot and burried in a shallow grave in the desert. By chance your survive, thanks to a robco securitron and a wastleland doctor, and set off in a quest for revenge which in turn causes you to be recognized by all the major fractions in the area causing you to be the man/women on the frontline in the coming war. This story isn't as interesting to play as it may sound however, but thats not what we're here for. You can play for over 200 hours on a single charter in the ultimate edition and still not beat the game once because of how many things there are to do. The quests and story can have a decent sense of moral ambiguity, which is one of the things I really enjoyed in the older Fallouts. The player is also given a greater feeling of choice and impact through having more options of how to deal with situations and having a greater veriaty of people in the Mojave desert.  I am also willing to factor mods into this review due to people making the intallation of them being as easy as a download and a few clicks. The Fallout modding community has created amazing quests and adventures that I feel do nothing but benefit the game. Just be careful with mods because it may destablize and already sensitive engine.",

The game otherwise ran fine unless there were a lot of objects on screen being physics'd on highest graphical settings.  Storywise the game is okay. The bethesda style open world RPG is not my preferred genre. I can't really feel invested in much of the stories from these games, I prefer usually to be behind existing characters with personalities rather than being 'myself' in the world but that's just how it is I guess.

I had this game pre-ordered as a gift for my seventeenth birthday, and have been playing it ever since.  After I played for a hundred hours, I decided that I didn't enjoy the constant hiccups and saving issues that the phat PS3 version had, and wanted to experiences the modding community this game had to offer.  This game has so much more quests and dialogue then the earlier fallout 3 game. I can understand why so many people say that it feels more like an expansion pack to fallout 3, because of the fact that there aren't that many new features than in fallout 3 (besides the recycling of ammo and the creation of foods and other gadgets &amp; gambling.) However, there is a larger amount of story that you get in this game, and I feel that although the map may feel smaller, the world is quite a bit more larger.  After playing around for a couple dozen playthroughs, HD Texture packs, dozens of extra quests, extra casino's, lightning textures and The Strip reinvations mods will give you even greater amounts of gameplay.  If you like Fallout 3 already, play it, but recognize that the begining may start out a bit more slower than its predecessors.",

That's how good this game is, that you can focus on so many different aspects of this game rather than the typical rpg 'Do A quest goto B, figure out B then do C main quest' You can play Fallout like this, if you want to. It's an option! That's the important thing that Bethesda delivers. Options! I am tired of games that force story down my throat and I just play it to be told a story the way they want to tell me it, I have no influence or decision in the game other than clicking the controls. The difference between FO:3 and many RPG games out there besides Skyrim, is many RPG's don't give players depth of character development, or as many weapons, or the way Bethesda gives players loot-options, Bethesda is the only company who develops games where you can look at a character in the game, ANYONE... be a villain, blow their head off, have the world react to it. and steal their loot. Yeep! YOU can take items from ANYBODY in the game, no restrictions like in Half Life or some other RPG's not worth mentioning. Look at other RPG's like they're elementary school, your parents(the company) Holds your hand, guides you on a linear path in the game and restricts you from almost everything besides the story that it's forcing on you. Bethesda produces games that are in college, they don't hold your hand anymore, they let you create a world based on your actions. Like an adult. There is no hand holding or forcing you to watch THEIR story the way THEY want YOU To watch it. nope you create the story for yourself.   I've explored nearly all of the wasteland, restarted as a melee character, unarmed melee, standard guns, and energy guns. Playing as a good guy and a bad guy. This game was so fun that I kind of turned it into an MMO farm experience, I would go 'hunting' during the day time, all day, killing scorpions, zombies and taking their loot and selling it at night, going to sleep then doing it the next day, naturally grinding would be annoying for people but I ♥♥♥♥ING LOVED IT! And I am not a grinder. Just this game was so fun, for so many different reasons that I didn't mind doing it. And I didn't realize it until now but that is pretty nerdy, I was actually roleplaying it as if It was real life... scary. I will forever be a fan of Bethesda. My only regret and problem I have with these games is they didn't stay 60 dollars for long enough. I should've paid 60 for it. Companies like this need to turn me homeless, take all my moneys pls. #HardcoreFanboy4life.   I haven't bought too many games, for having steam for 4 years, I try to only buy games I 100% know I will enjoy, after watching AngryJoe and Total Bisquit reviews will I usually buy a game, I try to smart purchase games... however I am rarely a fan, hell I am hardly a 'gamer' but Bethesda is a company that makes me believe there are passionate game companies that aren't just here for the money, and it's product that they deliver like this that makes me think that. Game companies that produce a consistent product like this, makes people ignore the graphics quality and focus on the heart of the game, Companies need the recognition  Exploration Character Customization Weapons Loot Side quests Main quests dialogue options   It's all done right. It could be improved but it's a solid foundation and I think Fallout and Elder scrolls is paving the way for a better RPG future amongst other companies. This is what people want. People want to be rewarded for exploration, testing out different character builds, having massive arsenol of weapons that you can keep in a dumpster next to the general store in Goodsprings hint hint. I never really liked doing side quests, in many games I guess cuz I felt it pointless, but that's where 90% of my time was in the game, I barely did the main quests I think I got up to the benny quest where he's in a casino or something and that's the farthest. I don't think that's very far. The rest was doing side quests, farming and grinding, exploring the wasteland. If you value the above. You're going to want FO:NV",

Once you're in you're hooked and can spend countless hours completing quests and finding new loot and interesting characters.  DLC:  Dead Money: (5.5/10) Just overall very aggrevating and has way too big of a difficulty spike half way through. On the plus side it does have a few unique melee weapons and some pretty charismatic characters.  Honest Hearts: (9/10) Probably my personal favourite of the dlc for this game. It unlocks a beautiful new area to explore and unlocks more background info on the burned man. Also has a few unique weapons and some armor depending on how you play it.  Old World Blues: (8.75/10) Almost as enjoyable as Honest Hearts. I think i like the previous one more just due to the environment it unlocked. Old World Blues unlocks a new place as well, but its not quite as compelling and has no real connection to the main game. On the plus side, tons of crazy new weapons and a wicked sense of humour.  Lonesome Road: (7.5/10) Probably the most impressive dlc graphically and a lot of the scenery reminded me of the wastes in Fallout 3. The biggest problem this one has is how short it is. I think i spent the least time on this one and it was a little too linear compared to the previous two. There are also much tougher enemies so don't bother playing this one til you're at least level 25-30. This is probably the most compelling story of all the dlcs, but really only has two characters and is just too short.  Overall: (9.2/10) With the exception of Dead Money the ultimate edition is an absolute must buy especially because it is so cheap now and you can get so much bang for your buck as far as gameplay time. Never reaches the heights of greatness Fallout 3 hit, but this is none the less a great game even if it is quite a bit buggy.",

Much of my time was spent simply in combat which thanks to the instant switch between first and third person offers many options for gameplay for those with a specific preference of combat overview. this game can honestly be what you want it to be whether as a survival game, a first person shooter, a role playing game, etc. as it stands the steam port is very flexible on what computers can run it and compared to the console versions which have constant crashing issues along with others even on a new disc i had very little trouble in this port except for some loading issues, the game only started crashing when i began to use mods but in the end those are not part of the game so that is understandable. The games dlc content is also some of the best money can buy with each add on either being a comedic science adventure or a trip to a canyon inhabited by tribals and irradiated beasts. All and all the game is great title that deserves a place in eveyones library especially when it goes on sale for about 3 dollars. i have both a console version and of course my steam version and on both i have spent countless hours either doing quests or creating my own story and path to walk. 5/5",

Multiplayer seems to be where gaming is, and if all they care about is money, you can see why Artificial Intelligent programming has slacked off severely, and the AI has become a placeholder for a human controller, less programming, less bugs to fix, with more money coming in.  That said... The game was very fun, desppite the AI stupidity, and how easy it was to kill them, especially with the VAT system in place. Plenty of weapons in the game, and places to see and there is always a bit of humor in the Fallout franchise, which keeps me coming back for more...  Con's Once you beat the campagin there's no real reason to keep playing the game, since the campaign will pretty much take you every where causing you to discover everything there is to discover... Where the game falls short is it's using the game platform to milk DLC additions to the game, I always thought this was a shady money making gimmick, so no longer do gaming company's have to provide you with an optimal gaming experience, when they can give you 'enough', and charge for the rest in DLC. Thats my beef with these one time giant gaming company's, that get you addicted to their games, then sucker you into the DLC.... Everyone's jumping on the bandwagon, just about...   All in all, the game was fun, and is worth a buy, because it will take you a long time to complete the campaign, and if you opt in to buy the DLC, will provide a few hours more game time after you've completed the campaign... .After which it'll sit in your steam account never to be touched again...

From that first shot in the head I was able to see that this game offered so much more. Set with a very loose main quest with many paths for you to take, you're given so much freedom. The map is filled with interesting locations and sights (more so if you take the Wild Wastelander perk.) The story line and those embeded along they way go very deep and you'll want to try and understand all the sotries. I was very much satisfied with what I could learn in this fictional universe. Wandering the wasteland that is the Mojave was a road completely full of life, and holding just as much loot. Then there's the DLC, each one has at least one moral to them, such as Lonsome Road and Ulysses's statement on how our we must use our pasts to affect our futures(It was a bit more complex when he says it, and it sounds so much grander.) Outside the morals the DLC are just as extensive as the main questline, if not even deeper at time explaining parts of the main story. Playing all of them was like playing a different game at times if you were able to really get into their finer points. Fallout: New Vegas is a Run'n'Gun game, a loot fest, a military operation, or it can be a full fledged RPG with all of these aspects; it's completely up to you. There are very few limits and you'll be playing for hours, I highly recommend you give this game a try.",

            "review_text": "Grab a modern Fallout fan and ask them what their favorite Fallout game is and chances are that they'll say, 'Fallout 3.' That's all well and good, but New Vegas provides what F3 lacked: strong writing, quest design, memorable characters, deeper equipment customization, and real character creation. If you're anything like me, the journey is just as important as the destination, maybe more so. Fallout 3 strikes that excellent post-apocalyptic sandbox feeling, while New Vegas provides a meaty foundation of lore, storytelling, and a real sense of being just an ordinary person who becomes caught up in a clash of social and political upheaval.   You play Fallout 3 for a sense of complete open freedom and empowerment as you roleplay.   You play New Vegas to participate in the world around you. The dialogue choices matter, your skills feel interwoven with all aspects of gameplay, and finally the karma system feels a bit more dynamic. People will not all love you, and they won't necessarily be wrong for doing so. There are shades of gray cast throughout every character and quest, and this is where New Vegas shines bright as the radiation scorched Strip that serves as its centerpiece. The world of New Vegas feels alive, and you get to weave one hell of a rags to riches story for yourself. One person really can make all the difference when all of the forces at work are balanced against each other on a knife's edge.   Unfortunately, it isn't without its problems. New Vegas suffers visually by rehashing Fallout 3's engine, and even after extensive efforts to patch bugs, they still have a tendency to rear their ugly coded heads. Also, as mentioned above, New Vegas is not a free and open sandbox like Fallout 3, which will be jarring for some. While it has many aspects of a sandbox, it is at its heart a game with a story to tell. It's a story you get to be part of and in large part design alongside the game, but you're ultimately headed where the developers want you to go.   To end on a semi-pretentious note: New Vegas is the more mature Fallout experience. It tackles far more interesting subject matter and ideas of personal identity than Fallout 3 could ever hope to. The levels of customization and character creation are much improved over Fallout 3, and it makes for a phenomenal roleplaying game. After experiencing all the lights of Vegas, Fallout 3 still seems vast and free to me, but also just a bit more empty.",

The rest is history; your history to be exact.  The modding capabilities of this game are outrageous; it nearly rivals the sandbox that is Garry's Mod in this aspect. Once you complete the game, I highly recommend you try out Project Brazil. Project Brazil is a community developed mod for FNV that introduces a new map the size of Fallout 3, and a vault that I dare say is better than any of the other vaults that Bethesda themselves have brought into existance. I would however, like to point out that Project Brazil is STILL under development even though it came out back in 2012. Unfortunitely, they decided to drop the development of module 3 at the end of 2013 (I think...) and 2014 was an overall slow year for the development of the project. So here we are in early 2015, and just recently (back in March) the development revived to preside the anticipated launch of Fallout 4 next year.  FNV is an overall stunning game; even five years later. I couldn't recommend this game more, but you will need a lot of free time to actually get into it just like most good games.

            "review_text": "Easily one of the best Role Playing Games I've had the pleasure of becoming immersed in. A fantasticly crafted world with incredibly entertaining characters and interesting and fun quest design is where this game shines brigtest. While it's occasionally held down by clunky melle combat, the V.A.T.S system is very entertaining to use, and can make skirmishes feel far more cinematic and exciting. My only REAL problem with the role playing is the way karma works. Often times the game makes it's choices far too black-and-white; I can only recall one quest where the main choice at the end actually felt like a moral dilema, rather than most quest that go something like, 'Murder person, get new gun. Don't murder person, get a few caps.' Scenarios like this is where I felt the dev's forgoed the oppourtunity to make interesting moral and ethical choices like those present in the Mass Effect games. Instead, we far too often simply get a 'good' and 'bad' choice, not an actual issue to contemplate.  And yet despite all of this, the characters and quest design really made up for what I felt the moral portion of the game lacked. So, so many of the major characters manage to be both funny and interesting; Lilly, Arcade Gannon, Veronica and The King were some of my favorite characters throughout the game. The quests offer a combination of simple tasks and mundane chores, as well as exciting romps and fully fleshed out mini-storylines. 'Come Fly With Me,' for example, is a quest where you're tasked with helping build rockets to launch a cult of ghouls (Heavily irradiated humans) to a destination their leader promises will be a safe haven for their kind. In another, 'GI Blues,' you help a crime lord, who also happens to be an Elvis Impersonator, sort out difficulties with a new militant group taking refuge in his territory. They all seem interesting, and while many have underwhelming rewards, the fact that you get to take part in such a fun adventure seems like a reward in itself.  I highly, highly reccomend this game to fans of Western RPG's, especially if you loved Oblivion. A good sense of humor, fantastic characters, and a rich, mysterious wasteland to explore will have you playing for hours.",

            "review_text": "Back when it was first announced and then released, all you would have to do is briefly mention Fallout: New Vegas and have them make some sort of comment such as, 'You mean Fallout 3.5?' or, 'It should have just been an expansion to Fallout 3!' and so on. People were so quick to see a new idea and a story different from that of the Lone Wanderer's that they didn't want to see it for what it was at all. People were so quick to look at a game that wasn't as backed by Bethesda as the former was and say the absolute worst about it in order to hold on to whatever they felt for the previous game, and for a long time I was one of those people myself.  But after a while I realized it wasn't fair of me to blindly judge a game I'd never played, never as much as watched gameplay for, never tried to educate myself on, and continue to stay stuck in oblivion about something that could turn out to be a lot better than any of us expected.  So I picked up a copy of New Vegas, and that was exactly the case. It was   better   than I thought it would be, all of the assumptions I'd built up being completely washed away by a game that should be getting so much more credit than it does to this day still. Courier Six isn't the Lone Wanderer, nor do they feel that way when switching between the two games, they're a fresh new persona to take on and it feels exactly how it should, like something new. After a tragic turn in Six's job to deliver a package to New Vegas, you start to realize just how much more freedom you're given in this game, compared to Fallout 3. Rather than being flat out told who was bad and who you were supposed to show sympathy for, who you were supposed to dislike, etc; your actions actually carry   weight   with other factions, cities, groups, individuals and they   will   be aware of what you do, and what you have already done. It really feels like a nation split up into parts, and once you start making waves for whatever purpose or person you decide to make them for, if not yourself, those parts   will   be watching you, and depending on what you do, they may or may not be happy about it.  New Vegas in my opinion, feels so much more lively than Fallout 3 did. From the very beginning, you're presented with a group of varying people that have their own quirks and as a whole, have their own issues that they wouldn't mind having you help out with, it feels like you aren't just given a quest by any of these people in any of these settlements that you do simply to get out of the way and receive some little reward for it, it feels more like there's actual consequences weighing on how you decide to handle each situation and majority of those consequences play out in the ending scenes. 'Treat others how you want to be treated' can be applied to most, if not all of the choices you can decide to make in this game. If you're an ♥♥♥ to one faction, expect that faction to be just as big of an ♥♥♥ to you back. If you're a saint, people might just help you out more than you expect.  While the storyline grants its freedoms throughout every quest for every faction, the story itself immerses you far quicker than it might've in F3. The opening cutscene fills you with a sense of confusion, a desire for explanation, and just a little bit of a craving for revenge for yourself and your Courier. Each build-up to key points in the story is given to you in a rather fulfilling way, like you've spent just the right amount of time looking for this person, you've travelled just the right length of land to reach this place and you're one step closer to the final battle for Hoover Dam, which decides the fate of the Mojave, and who holds control of it after you've picked your allies. There are a few instances where things could be put together more neatly, but it can be easily looked over by the rest of the game.  Most of the scenery -- and all of the combat -- stick to the roots created in Fallout 3, the same barren and dangerous environment that's supposed to keep you on your toes, and does. V.A.T.S is always there if you need it and the option for true iron sights can make you feel more like you're actually aiming rather than repeatedly mashing buttons while turning around trying to shoot whatever you're trying to shoot, but I found it was more of a burden than any more immersive sort of experience. The combat is the same as it was and S.P.E.C.I.A.L and a perk every two levels returns just as usual, featuring a lot more perks to increase your carry weight which helps out extensively when you're out scavenging for junk.  Just as the storyline is fulfilling, the DLC does not slip up one bit. I'd recommend getting every one, and playing them in order, since the story they create when put together forms an experience unlike any other I've seen in any downloadable content, and while you may not enjoy it the first playthrough, each one will grow on you. Unlike F3's DLCs, the ones in New Vegas give you insight on your Courier, and how one of their choices before the game affected the life of someone you will hear about in both the DLCs and the vanilla game itself; and subsequently how they devoted a great portion of their life to following you, eventually deciding to let you come to them. The build-up to this storyline is unbelievable, as well, truly a plot worth witnessing and coming to grips with just how easily one decision can start a chain of events.  This is an open-world game, and with all open-world games, there's always the typical graphical glitches, the hilarious ragdoll-looking bugs and the less-than-enjoyable occasional patches of lag and crashes, though it's hardly any level that makes you unable to play this game for hours on end, with all of the places available for you to discover (Vaults, too!) you're bound to stumble across something that catches your interest and takes some of your time if you're not looking to finish the main storyline right away. In short, there's something to do for everyone, heroes and villains of the Mojave alike.  New Vegas has become the love of my video game life, with over 100+ hours invested into Couriers of all types on the PS3 and now getting wrapped up into it all over again with already 30+ hours as I write this after only having it bought for the PC just a few days ago, if you're after a post-apocalyptic RPG to tide you over as long as it takes for Fallout 4 to rear its head, this'd be it. It's a game inviting to those looking for a story, a shooter, a game with enjoyable DLC (in ALL of the DLC) and a game to mod, that's what you're after. Give it a chance and it just might surprise you.",

I've spent well over 2000 hours on the console and I regret that I didn't get it for PC first. The vanilla game itself is great, but community made mods improve the game. Want to experience even more quests? mods. Want to overhaul the factions and make them tougher and/or more numerous? mods. Want to be a A FREAKIN GHOUL? mods. If you have listened to my advice, I would highly recommend New Vegas Bounties 1 and 2, FCO (Fallout Character Overhaul), various mods that add weapons (I hardly find Vanilla game weapons anymore!), and C.A.G.E. (Continue After Game Ending) or something similar. Also, Project Nevada, which further extends the Implants that alter your stats, enables Sprinting, and even customize Ammo/loot drops, Hardcore mode changes (more frequent needs), ability to blow up locks, Night Vision on certain helmets, and much much more. If you install mods, get the Fallout Mod Manager (FOMM) and the Mod Configuration Menu for in game use to change these things on the fly.  10/10 and holy hell, Fallout 4... I am too ready",

            "review_text": "Fallout: New Vegas is a vast, expansive game that evolves upon many of the concepts and mechanics in Fallout 3, whilst reviving ideas from the previous games in the series and incorporating everything into a cohesive, if somewhat overwhelming whole. After playing for over 150 hours, I have still left vast swathes of the wasteland unexplored, hours of dialogue unheard, quests unresolved... The game can be completed in a variety of ways - from indulging in the somewhat masochistic hardcore mode which mostly serves as an annoyance - to the 'speedrun' approach of following only the main quest line and neglecting the game's various attempts to distract you with side quests and the wasteland's mysteries.  Mechanically, New Vegas grants the player substantial freedom to play the game in exactly the way they wish, and offers multiple solutions to most quests and situations - such as diffusing conflict with your speech skill, assassinating an enemy with a sneak kill, or equipping heavy armour and weaponry, and wiping out an enemy settlement. The game will impose consequences for your actions - such as being hunted by assassins when you make yourself the enemy of a faction - or receiving regular gifts by becoming their ally. The factions have their own allegiances, desires and advantages - allowing you to play them against each other and directly influence the wasteland's political landscape.  As with other games of the 'Elder Scrolls format' - there are a number of issues with npcs that distract from the experience and somewhat disrupt the realism of the experience: the conversations that freeze the rest of the game world break immersion somewhat when another character can be seen frozen mid-walk in the background, or the fading-out of characters as they pass between areas. These issues are fortunately largely obviated by the excellent voice acting and authentic, well-characterised conversation trees. There is a staggering amount of dialogue - with all of the major characters having their own identity, style and humorous quirks.  The last major element of the game worthy of discussion is the combat system, which is weighty and satisfying - heavy weapons can send corpses flying though the air, or exploding into a hilariously-gruesome shower of blood, eyeballs and meaty chunks. Laser and plasma weapons can reduce enemies to piles of dust or goo, guns can be loaded with a variety of ammunition types to suit different threats, melee fighters can learn special close-combat moves, and virtually every weapon has some exotic unique variation, or a number of modifications that can be applied.  I would recommend this game strongly - for its flexible storytelling for the RPG fan - for its hilariously gratuitous action for the FPS fan - and for its sheer enormity for those who enjoy an adventure.",

            "review_text": "Fallout: New Vegas is one of the best games I've ever had the pleasure to experience. I use the term 'experience' as opposed to 'play' in this case because that's exactly what Fallout: New Vegas is, an experience! You ultimately decide the fate of the Mojave wasteland, and the people and locations you come across throughout the game force my hand in congratulating the developers at Bethesda (not that I was reluctant in the first place!).  Fallout: New Vegas has one of the most enticing stories that I've been able to uncover in a game, it's vast plot adds to the already humongous database that makes up Fallout's lore. Now, this review can't all be praise for this game, right? Right. I will focus on the most prominent problem that unfortunately plagues Fallout: New Vegas. The glitches. While there are some glitches that I have come across that I could solve using console commands, there are many major glitches that I have come across that required tedious research and numerous trial and error attempts to fix. Some of these major glitches include: -Freezing on start-up -Broken character interactions -Missing characters/Impossible to complete quests I'm sure there are plenty of mods that can fix many of the problems I have come across, not unlike Skyrim. Now, to move back onto the praise... The DLC, my God! The DLC! The Downloadable content for this game is among the most enjoyable, maybe even the best DLC I have ever downloaded for a game. All of the stories are tied together in one way or another (with the exception of Honest Hearts, I haven't found any links to/from that one) and they have all made a lasting impression on me that I'm sure will last a long time, for better (Lonesome Road) or worse (Dead Money) ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) All joking aside, the DLC presented a welcome challenge and a unique story. Definitely worth the cost!  Overall, Fallout: New Vegas is possibly the best single player game I have experienced in a long time. I would recommend it to anyone who happens to be a fan of Bethesda's other works/Fallout 3.",

I really enjoy this game. Obsidian knocked it out of the park, they did a great job in the Fallout Universe. Not only did they lighten the game up a bit for new players like me, but they also stuck to fallout roots and stayed true to Fallout 3. The game did get boring at some points, the landscape was the same and made it feel dull, and even though graphics were never a big part of Fallout, i feel they lacked a lot this game, and didn't feel as immersive as Fallout 3 where the Captial Wastelands were more vivid. Fallout New Vegas however, does something better than Fallout 3, and thats the construction of humanity. Fallout 3 made you feel like the bomb just dropped, even though it was generations prior. Fallout New Vegas actually shows the reconstruction of humanity and does it quite well. Fallout New Vegas overall is a good game and has good gameplay.  Gameplay: 7/10 - Got a bit boring but still fun Graphics: 5/10 - Not bad, but I believe Metro 2033 came out the same year and those graphics are way better. I am a bit eased up on it though because Fallouts strong points haven't been graphics.  Overall: 8/10: Lacked some roleplay elements and the landscape was very bland.",

            "review_text": "I'm not going to lie, this is the most awesome game I have ever played. I both have it on the PC and the Xbox and played all the missions on them, even the DLCs. If you like a survival game where you are on a borderline between civilization and anarchy, this game is suited for you. I recommend downloading all the DLCs for this game as you will get more options to work with. Now note that when playing Fallout games, your decisions will alter the ending in some way. So before you beat the game, make sure you have done EVERY mission or you won't get a complete ending.  Now for those who are thinking of buying this game, your character's development is very specific. It is similar to 'Fallout 3' but slightly modified. The actions and reactions you make in the plot of the game is determined by your raw power and skills. Raw power being S.P.E.C.I.A.L.: Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility, and Luck. I recommend maxing out one of these raw power abilities as you will need to have a strength in something to avoid dying constantly. Now you get numerous skills, which are indirectly determined by S.P.E.C.I.A.L. For example, having a high level in intelligence will give you tagged skills in Science, Medicine, and Repair. The higher the skill, the more your life is made easier when the situation demands them. The final stage of character development are perks, which are made available to you depending on your raw powr and skills. These perks will open back doors to handling situations and benefit your chance of survival in some way. For example, getting the 'Cannibal' perk will allow you to eat human corpses when food is scarce, but at a cost.  Just to let you know, there is a 'Hardcore Mode'. In Hardcore mode, you have to worry about food, water, and sleep. Some aspects of the game will get harder with hardcore mode is one. For example, healing will slowly regenerate your health rather than replenishing it instantly. Healing crippled limbs may determine the difference between life and death, as you will encounter some enemies you need to run away from. Some enemies, however, will only sign your death certificate regardless. Luckily for you, you can craft all sorts of goodies using the appropriate workstation. Find a workbench, reloading bench, and a campfire if you are planning on making some homemade goods.  Now with the aspects of the game covered, the one thing you must know about the Fallout game is that it's full of bugs and coding errors. They're not straight out and obvious, but they will crawl out of the woodwork to haunt you. Some of these bugs and glitches can be fixed using the console command, but this option is not available to you if you decide to play the console version of the game. I stopped playing the PC version of this game long ago because the constant crashes and freezes that keep happening on my computer. I would recommend playing the console version of the game as it is more stable, however the bugs and glitches are slightly more unusual, so save often.  TL;DR:  The game is great, giving all sorts of aspects of survival and danger of a post-apocalyptic world; but be ready for the occasional game freeze and the annoying bugs.",

Many areas are too big for what they contain, wasting your time as you run across the large open spaces. Huge chunks of the map are completely empty, and Ceasar's Legion has very little content and are just underwhelming in general. Also Honest Hearts DLC is very easy to break as your guide (that you need to do any of the quests in the whole land) both looks like your enemies and is usually firing in your direction when you first encounter him. Killing him breaks all quests in Honest Hearts.   That is the bulk of the crappy stuff, if you can look past stuff like that then there is no reason not to play this.",

Definitely worth if you're a fan, and make sure to get the DLC packs as well!  The long version?  Well first off like I just said, the game is identical to FO3 in many ways, but they've added little things here and there that make the experience more in-depth. Stuff like aiming down the ironsights, weapon mods, more companions with fleshed out backstories and unique traits that won't die on you by accident, casinos and gambling, a pretty decent card game called Caravan, a new faction system involving the New California Republic, Caesars Legion and Mr. House, in place of the FO3's karma system (which is still there, but not terribly important anymore). The other big addition is Hardcore mode, which makes the game more challenging by involving new stats like hunger, thirst, sleep, more difficult to heal injuries, less item carrying space, permanent companion deaths, etc. I tried it out and liked the extra challenge... until I realized that your companion deaths are permanent too. And given how dumb the AI can be at times... yeah, too much hassle right there.   The plot is much more nuanced than what FO3 had. While the NCR ultimately does tend to be the better group of the three due to making an effort to integrate the locals instead of forcefully removing them from their lands or outright slaughtering them, they've still got their grey areas and a few shady characters who lack scruples and are willing to give the axe to anyone who doesn't play nice... Colonel Munroe comes to mind. Kinda difficult to empathize with Caesar's Legion though, since they're basically a bunch of enslaving technophobics who view women and people of lower castes as property and little else, and their questline feels shorter and rushed compared to the others.   The increased max character level does mean that you can beef up a bit more, and it doesn't make the Raiders and other minor groups crazy-overpowered to compensate, the DLC expansion areas (ESPECIALLY Lonesome Road) being the exceptions. Takes much longer to reach the max level as well, but you'll definitely reach it long before completing more than half of the game.  The glitches are definitely a problem; a lot of the bigger ones at release have been fixed, but there are still a ton of bugged quests and items out there; a good example being the 'Beyond the Beef' quest which I'd recommend avoiding entirely if possible. You will probably need to download a fanpatch or two if you really want to fix it.",

            "review_text": "Hello there, I don't know why the hell you would need to be looking at any reviews for this, this is  Fallout , is it not?  But anyway I will say that this was my first experience with  Fallout , on PS3 however.  If you are thinking of buying this game on a console be warned: STAY AWAY!  The game is great but the console port of this game is broken, and to make it worse the only bugs they fixed on consoles were the ones that were at least entertaining, leaving the ones that freeze/crash the game alone for some reason.  If you haven't noticed I'm double spacing each individual sentence so that this has some consistency with my other reveiws, and to ensure that it is up to par with all other non-joke reveiws in terms of length.  I have played all the Bethesda  Fallout  games now (no I have not had the pleasure of experiencing  Fallout 1, 2, Tactics, BoS  or  Van Buren ) and I think this one is my favorite in terms of style.  I don't think any of the other  Fallout s let you be a Cowboy/girl sporting a classic dueling revolver or leaver-action repeater.  You can also have sex with a guy who previously shot you in the face and buried you in a shallow grave, I don't know who would want to do that but its possible (I'm pretty sure that only female characters have this option for obvious reasons).  The character facial customization leaves something to be desired though, when I played this on the PS3 I tried to make my character look like me only to end up with a cowboy-Elvis-cardboard box hybrid.  On Steam my character is much more aesthetically pleasing but I think it could still be better.  I should probably start talking more about the gameplay and choices since I'm pretty sure that's what most of you came here for.  Of the three  Fallout  games I've played, this one seems to have the most choice in terms of plot development, unlike  Fallout 3  (I don't know how 4 ends yet) you are not forced to ally with the Brotherhood of Steel, and the Enclave aren't even present anymore ( Fallout's 2  and  3  will explain this), instead you have the New Calafornia Republic and Caesar's (pronunced  Kysar 's) Legion.  Due to time restraints during this game's development the Legion is not seen nearly as much as the NCR, though their role in the main story is equally as important as the NCR's.  These time constraints also likelly explain why the console port is so broken.  The gunplay in this game is superior to that of  Fallout 3 , as you can actually look down the iron sights in combat.  If your character also turns out looking not at all that bad I would also recommend playing this in 3rd preson, I really like looking at the backside of my character while I shoot Viper Gunslinger heads off for some reason.  In this game you have four possible main story arcs, each with multiple different endings, you can side with the NCR, Caesar's Legion, New Vegas or none of them and create an independent Vegas.  That adds a whole new level of RPG-ness to the game (I'm pretty sure  Fallout 3  does not feature nearly as many endings as this game).  V.A.T.S is still just as useful and unique as it ever was.  I'm sort of mentioning everything I think I need to talk about (why did I write talk because you are reading this and not actually hearing me speak) at random here.  The perk and skill system is still present and not dumbed-down like it is in  Fallout 4  (I know a lot of people would want to know about that, although a more 'streamlined' character building system has never bothered me).  Karma is still present and Reputation has been reintroduced ( Fallout 3  did not have reputation and  Fallout 4  has neither).  The only bug I've encounterd (in the STEAM version, not the PS3 as there are many, many game-breaking bugs in that version) is that occasionally when I reload a save the loading screen goes on forever.  That only happens SOMETIMES, not often enough for me to really be bothered by it.  I did not have to fix the game the same way I had to with  Fallout 3  on my laptop (yes I'm running this stuff on a LAPTOP), which runs Windows 8 (no Microsoft I will not re-enable the auto-update 'feature' and get Windows 10).  By the way after I fixed  Fallout 3  that game started running magically, and I haven't encountered a single bug.  Also the guy who shoots you in the head that you can later choose to have sex with is voiced by Matthew Perry who played Chandler on  Friends .  This game also features gambling (you should have already guessed that), but sadly there is no Texas Holdem', only Blackjack, slots and Roulette.  I would have thought that Obsidian Entertainment would have been able to realize that there is nothing more satisfying than winning a game of virtual Texas Holdem' in a sandbox game.  That was like my third favorite part of  Red Dead Redemption  after the story and gameplay.  Instead you have this new card game called Caravan that I tried to play but really didn't find that fun or self explanatory.  But at least the amazing and often-unusual sidequests more than make up for the amount of time I would have spent playing Texas Holdem' if it were included.  The DLC for this game is also amazing, as per usual with any RPG publised by Bethesda.  I recommend that you buy the Ultimate Edition, as it is well worth the price of admission just to hear a Brain-in-a-jar mistaken your toes male jenitles.  Oh, and all the companions are awesome, I know for a fact that you will at least recruit Veronica as she is one of the first potential companions you will encounter.  And if you are disappointed by a lack of Dogmeat, ED-E will more than make up for it.  And unlike  Fallout 3 , the only times your companions can die is if you are on a high difficulty or if you decide to kill them yourself for some reason.  Veronica! Don't charge at that Deathclaw! What are your, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!? I guarantee that its natural claws are far more powerful than that pneumatic gauntlet you're wearing!  Running into a bunker to get away from a group of rogue palidins that are way stronger than you only to get attacked by everyone inside for no reason and then accidentally tell Veronica to sit still while she gets attacked and you are forced to flee leaving her there finding that the rogue palidins outside are no longer hostile towards you while everyone inside still wants you dead and then you eventually come back to rescue Veronica later with a missile launcher killing several of her family members and making her angry with you and then you realize that there are companion dismissal termials scattered in convienient locations throughout the map that would have sent her back to where you first met her if you used it/10",

I have played fallout games on the xbox and just recently switched to PC. this is THE best RPG/Open World game I have ever played. It offers 2 styles of game play with different difficulties, mass varity of weapons, friends and foes, as well as a few easter eggs for those who are up for the challenge. this is a game that is good for people who just started playing RPG or the most expierenced players.   this game has the best story because there are so many different branches you can take. with the diffeerent difficulties come different play styles you can choose to be good/bad/neutral, each with its own pros and cons. the skill tree has two sets. there is the abilities and perks.   abilities are based on a rank of 15 to 100. as you level up you can choose how to distribute 15 ability points per level. the higher your rank in any one catagory grants access to better weapons, armor, repair, etc... this requires a lot more thought then 'oh i need this to use this thingy over there now' and start thinking about 'where will i be in 6 hours of gameplay and what will i need for that area'   the perks is the second part to your fallout charactor. i believe you get a perk every other level. perks grant additional bonuses and or abilities. Same thing as stated above it takes some thought so that you don't wast a perk and select something useless to your charactor.  while I support this game to the upmost of my abilities there are still bugs. this can be fixed with a few modifications. this does not deminish gameplay as much. the game occationaly stops loading or crashes. that can be fixed by adjusting your graphic settings.  again i recommend this to all players that enjoy open world games with an amazing story, gameplay and to those that enjoy an overall amazing game.",

I'm an old-fart gamer (started playing on the Sinclair ZX 81...) and don't like so-called 'twitch shooters', nor thitd-person or top-down perspectives: it's either FPS or nothing for me. That's why I love these later releases in the Fallout series so much - you get to choose first- or third-person and can switch between the two with a simple keypress.  Also, I like to enjoy the visuals of games, something that's hard to do if you're hell-bent on getting through a game as fast as possible. In this game you can rush through the main mission(s) as fast as you want, or, if like me you prefer to take your time and savor every last location and side mission along the way, FONV will satisfy.

I have personally played this game for hundreds of hours, I will admit, with many mods, but that is just another reason why Bethesda's games are great, they are very supportive of the community and offer tools for them to make player made content to share.

            "review_text": "I was playing the role of a NCR boy. Running their ♥♥♥♥ing errands and getting the boot of their 'lawfull' system they made for themselves. I never knew the ♥♥♥♥ed up world of the Mojave was until I was told to kill some fiends outside to the west of The Strip- my death sentance. They said it was a good way to prove I was raner material, and that it would get me more reputation amoungst the higher ups. As a good little ♥♥♥♥, I fallowed through. Went to the west and saw the fiends I was ordered to take out. There were atleast eight of those ♥♥♥♥s sitting at the end of my sight, and I dared not approach them, since I was alone after all. Even though I had a truster service rifle at my disposal, those ♥♥♥♥s had ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ laser rifles. Tech. that would surely ♥♥♥♥ my day up, so I fell back. Planning on a way to possibly sneak up and ambush the ♥♥♥♥ers. But I never was good at planning my actions. I did always fallow the orders like a little slave to Colonel Hsu, so I had no intention to go off on my own meret. After I thought to myself and convinced myself that I had nothing in my abilities to take out these wastes of time. So headed back to Camp McCarran. As I was walking, I saw some Legionaires across the road. I wanted to run, but they could easily snipe me down, and I could confront them, since I was one and they were atleast seven in a crew. I kept on walking, trying to hide my NCR appearence. This work for about twenty feet, until one of them saw me. Those savages could see anything- as long as they could make a slave out of it. They ran towards me, and confronted me until I was surrounded. Each pointing their guns and machetes at me. Until one of the Legionaires looked at me. I could tell by the way he looked at me, he liked what he saw. A grim chill ran down my spine as he spoke,  'Well-well-well. What do we have here?' He said in an excited manner. 'A ♥♥♥♥ing NCR dog running without a collar!'  I looked toward him with fear engulfing my very thought. As I was trying to reach for my gun, I felt a slight scratch on my neck, and the next thing I knew was darkness shrouding my vision. I thought they had decapitated me for some sort of pridal trophie to desplay to Caesar. But I awake; when I saw the Legionaires it was a damp dark sky. But in wake; I found the sky to be that of blues and oranges being split apart by purple shards or glass glimming across the skylines. And as I saw what I thouht had been the last sight, there he was in the flesh. Caesar. I looked toward me with a smile, and began to speak to me, and not of my death sentance, surprisingly.  'Well, I surely hope you have something to say to me, pup.' He said with terrifying confidance. 'Falling asleep as my men try get a new slave to join the ranks. Though, you didn't seem like a normal NCR tropper, you seemed to have hated your time within the confines of Camp McCarran.'  'H-how do you know that I was stationed at McCarran?' I replied.  He laughed and started up again: 'I have spies that can get things done around the Mojave, and they all are looking for week links in the chains of the NCR. Now, Do you truly hate what you do at the NCR?' He asked with an eagerness of a child.  'I do hate that hell hole of that camp. Every officer thinks they're God bestowing wisdom upon the camp just because they are ranked higher than a trooper.' I said with great sincerity.  'Well then' Caesar said with some for of remorse inside a box of great power, 'Since you were a dog of the NCR, and don't need training. I could offer you a role within my Legion. Just think, you could get back at all of your officers within the NCR! You could see them die to crusifictions that you have blessed them with! Now. What do you say, pup? Will you join the Legion?'  I quickly shook my head with the eager ambition of killing whatever NCR I could find within the Mojave. And that is the tale of how I became a part of the great Legion army. The faith of Caesar that sealed my faith within life.   Ave! True to Caesar!",

For those who would complain about the graphics, and animations know that the game is several years old now, and there are numerous packs on sites like nexusmods that will at least partially fix your problems, along with just about anything else you can imagine.

Most have you be the 'HERO WHO SAVES ALL NOW GO AND DO SOME CHORES' where with this one you can do chores for Slavers, Heroes, A business man, or yourself.  There are several sides in the game that you can choose from, Caesers Legion, New Californa Repulic, Mr House, and You the Joker. I will give a brief run down on each but it wont be too long.  Caesers Legion: Voted most likely to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s Caesers Legion return to the days of the Romans and are attempting to conquer the wasteland, they are mainly slavers and their weapons are pretty primative however they make up with it in using their firsts to give you a headache both physically and mentally. They have their own currency but it serves little purpose.  New California Republic (NCR): The NCR are supposed to be the good guys but really even they are jerks at times, the NCR's goals are to revert the wasteland to what it once was before the LOLNuke dropped on it, they even brought back the old american dollars and coins which barely buy you a bottle cap. Their forces are US soldiers mainly nothing too special.  Mr House: Mr House is mainly the Neutral side and is run by (take a ♥♥♥♥ing guess) Mr House, he is always shown up on screen though you only ever get to see him in person in the other 3 sides (I am not going to tell you what he looks like), his forces are securitrons, built with the lastest ASSWHOOPCHIP300 to wreck you he runs Vegas though so yeah.  Joker: You, you will make your own army and fight the other three sides, wether you say you are good bad or neutral is up to you but either way this is the hardest side. Your forces are dependent on side quests you do though you will always have the securitrons later on. Nothing much to say here because you are the one who shapes it.  The game is fun with RP and shooting elements and it is always nice to find some place new that you have not found before. You basically shape your own destiny and in the end, you will decide who is victorious.  The game is all around great cept for one problem: GLITCHES ARE ♥♥♥♥♥ES. There are a lot and I mean a lot of bugs in the game you could call it a nest of it, then again I have come to expect this with Bethesda in general.  The game is great and I am still waiting for Fallout 4, this is a game I feel almost everyone should have.  9/10",

It was disappointing not finding better gear after 30h into the game at level 20 or so, but admittedly, with all the extensions there are still heaps of areas not being explored even after 55h. Maybe i'm too much tuned into Borderlands atm. &lt;:) Also, not being a fan of gambling, the whole Vegas setting went past me. Receiving an achievement iconified by an anarchy A while commanding a robot army to keep the peace seems rather odd as well.  But don't fret! If you like the Fallout series, you will like this as much as its predecessors.  This game has some serious save game issues. Every time i start a new session, it takes a couple of attempts until the game will succeed in loading a save game, it seems to be stuck in an infinite loop while the roulette is spinning and spinning and spinning and spinning and spinning and spinning and spinning and spinning and spinning and spinning and spinning and spinning.

Most memorable are the new cast of companions: desperate, tragic characters that are believable and more than just mules with pre-recorded dialogue. This focus on the (in)humanity of the wasteland brings us back to the political focus of the plot, which asks players to ultimately make a decision about the fate of a pocketful of civilization. It's not a world-spanning, world-saving RPG. The world's already ended; there's no villain to contest, no prophecy to fulfill, no artifact to retrieve; the story invites you to think about and shape the future of a nation's second founding.

The complexity and number of the factions is almost staggering, each with their own morals, agendas, alliances, and questlines, and they really make the game interesting. There is a wide variety of weapons to choose from and the perks are appealing and make the gameplay and character building more interesting than ever before. Replay value is immense since you can take the game in a mutlitude of directions based on the choices you make in certain situations, and who you decide to make your allies/enemies. And of course, the gameplay itself is incredibly satisfying due to the targeting and crippling of specific limbs and the variety of ways that you can eliminate your adversaries.

Fallout: New Vegas uses the same engine as Fallout 3, but the world is much more faithful to the original games, and the story line is much more complex and politically-focused. New Vegas is one of the most ambitious RPGs ever made, forcing the player to juggle a myriad of interconnected quests and objectives in a complex web of politics. It is up to the player to decide the fate of the Mojave Wasteland by choosing one of four factions to side with in the battle for Hoover Dam. The game is highly replayable because, with the exception of the early game, siding with different factions results in highly varied objectives and outcomes. The game isn't perfect, but it is a very engrossing experience, with Obsidian putting much more thought into the actual role-playing aspect of the game than Bethesda did with Fallout 3.  The DLC for Fallout: New Vegas is mostly a series of independent quests tangentially connected to the main game with an underlying storyline that gets rapped up in the final piece of DLC: Lonesome Road. Do yourself a favor and play the DLC areas in the order in which they were released: Dead Money--&gt;Honest Hearts--&gt;Oldworld Blues--&gt;Lonesome Road. The conclusion of Lonesome Road will feel much more satisfying and personal if you pay attention to the details about Ulysses scattered throughout the main game and the other DLC. It's unfortunate that an important storyline that was clearly planned from the game's original release had to be hidden away in DLC that very few people have played.",

I've had the ultimate edition for my Xbox 360, and I played that more thoroughly. This game is a must play, and I highly recommend the DLC's. The game itself is great, but the DLC's just make you love it more. In the Mojave there is so much to do. There are 4 main Ideals to follow in the game. My personal favorite was the NCR because of their old world ideals. I'd have to give a honorable mention to Yes Man/Wildcard. It was fun to design your own parth with wildcard. There are many iconic locations, interesting weapons, and great characters. The best part about this game are the DLC's. Im going to talk about them in which I recommend the player to try first. The first DLC to play would be Honest Hearts. Its easy, great story, cool loot, and will help level up your courier. This was my second favorite DLC, it was put together so well and my favorite character was Joshua Graham. The second DLC to play would be Old World Blues. This is my least favorite of the DLCs, but its still amazing. This was the first DLC I did(having the option of all four). You get a metric ton of weapons, its a adventure to explore the think tank, and there are plenty of cool enemies. My favorite character was Dr.Mobius. Its not as easy as Honest Hearts, but its not as hard as Lonesome Road. The third I would recomend playing is Dead Money. This is my third favorite DLC. Its enemies aren't that difficult, but the environmental conditions and the traps make it all the harder. Its pretty long, so be ready for an adventure. Not to mention your loot is taken in the beginning, I like this feature because it gives a survival aspect to it, you have to build your way back up(you get your stuff back once the DLC is over). My favorite character would have to be Dog/God. Oh, and for this DLC I have a least favorite character, Father Elijah. The last one I'd recomend playing is Lonesome Road. Its my favorite out of the four. Its very challenging, thats why you should play it last. In the storyline its the last DLC you're supposed to play too. Its story is the best I've seen in a DLC, you get cool and handy loot, and you travel to the interesting place called the Divide. This DLC is the ultimate test for the courier, and its the hardest part of the whole game. Prepare yourself for it, and dont give up. My favorite character is Ulysses. I would have to give a honorable mention to E-DE as a great charater too. There are also loot DLC's, they're cool, but not big enough to discuss. Fallout New Vegas is masterpiece. It goes on sale alot so get it while its on sale. Thanks for reading this long review. Have fun.",

I chose to buy Fallout: New Vegas.  Let me first give you a brief summary about the two games: Fallout 3: You are a vault dweller. Your father has left the vault for an unknown reason. You go after him and enter the Capital Wasteland. You're main goal is to find your father again. Fallout: New Vegas: You are a courier who had to deliver a package, but in the middle of your journey you were shot in the head by a member of the Chairmen (one of the families of the Strip). You wake up after being healed by an old man and you track him down. There is also a war going on in the Mojave Wasteland between the NCR, the New California Republic which is a faction that works with laws and such as they did before the bombs fell, and Caesers Legion, a faction based upon the old Romian Empire which is build upon slaves.  There are two major differences in the two games. Fallout 3 is build upon the idea that you are fresh out of the vault. In the game, everything is new to you ánd your character. Fallout: New Vegas is not really build upon this idea. You were shot in the head and you start your journey from a little farmers town.  Fallout 3 has an interesting storyline which I really enjoyed. It feels more personal then in New Vegas. Fallout: New Vegas has a lot (and I mean a lot) of choices. The game is bigger than Fallout 3, because it has more quests.  I chose New Vegas because I wanted to have a lot of things to do in the game. But I now regret this decission. I think you should buy Fallout 3 first, it's a great beginning for Fallout games in general if you have never played one. You get all the basics early on in the game and your goal is pretty clear. If you already played Fallout 4, then I'd recommend you to buy Fallout: New Vegas.",

            "review_text": "Fallout: New Vegas is the continuation of the series of Fallout games from Bethesda. Using similar controls, mechanics, and a similar engine from the previous instalment makes jumping into this title very easy but there are some significant and pretty fun differences.  Skills have been updated first and foremost. Small Guns and Big Guns have been merged into Guns while there's a new skill Survival which allows you to cook and create poisons. Equally Explosives now covers not only the grenades and mines in the game but any weapon which fires an explosive shell. This makes an interesting variant for some characters who would have been in a very niche market using Explosives back in Fallout 3.  There's also Hardcore mode. It awards an achievement, requires you to sleep (and eat and drink), makes it so that crippled limbs can only be healed with a Doctor's Bag, Stimpaks and other healing items also heal over time rather than instantly, and can be quite an interesting gameplay experience.  Damage Threshold is making a return from the previous instalments and is probably the biggest change for early game characters. Unlike Damage Resistance, which negates a certain percentage of damage- Damage Threshold (DT) completely ignores it. This means that with heavier armour the bandits and ghouls won't be able to damage you at all but it also works in reverse. It creates an interesting gameplay experience where you are unable to tackle the strongest and toughest enemies immediately, often as the damage required to break their DT is only available on weapons at 75-100 skill with a particular weapon.  Other changes include the removal of Bobbleheads and the addition of Implants which are tied to your Endurance statistic, Gecko Kebabs, lots of different houses, Las Vegas (uh, New Vegas), cazadores, a nomadic culturally stunted group of ordinance loving Vault dwellers, a number of bandit clans, cazadores, Joshua Graham, and a dozen different endings.  The DLC is a mixed bag (personally). I love the nostalgic and sci-fi humour of Old World Blues, I enjoy the story behind Honest Hearts, and find the Lonesome Road to be a thoroughly enjoyable trawl through your back story. However, Dead Money is not a favourite of mine. There's nothing fun about being taken, naked, with a collar on you, to a strange place while an old man watches you fight crazy guys in gas masks, with nothing more than a spear (when you're a Guns character). Unless you're into that sort of thing.  However, on the whole, I find that Fallout: New Vegas is a very enjoyable experience. It's got the kind of choices, plot development, and freedom that you can pretty much do whatever you like wherever you want to bar the few main quests that are necessary to your chosen end. The addition of Factions has made the gameplay experience more realistic and allowed for many more conclusions to the quests than you could have previous. Long gone are the days of mystical Karma where that guy you shot in Megaton is making you hated in Rivet City. Now that guy you shot in Goodsprings has no effect on the people of The Strip.  There are a lot more opportunities to develop and build your character in a number of ways. You can create a completely diplomatic character using Speech and Barter checks to get through fights rather than guns, or you can create an all out war machine with every kind of weapon known to man, or you could even create a character that thematically fits the idea of a cowboy or ol' Western hero. It's up to you. Unlike Fallout 3 where there were certain skills needed to pass through some quests without hassle or combat was the major option- it isn't the same here.  Equally if you're feeling like you want a bit more from the game you can always crack open Hardcore mode. It doesn't seem like much of a difference until you realise how many enemies in the game cripple you, how often you can realistically stop to eat/drink, and how much you value the instant healing of Stimpaks. You'll get into the habit of preventive healing rather than adaptive healing. It's a great little twist on an already immersive game.  Which is my final point and something that I feel both Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas do so very well- immersion. Sure, there's still a HUD (which would be difficult to remove) but there's a lot of other great things as well. The atmosphere, the NPCs, the corny Western references, the music on the radio, the music of the game in general, the feeling of setting out across this unusual and hostile wasteland, the diversity of locations in the DLC, the great number of changes the world has when you do certain things or befriend certain people. It's a game that feels alive and has a lot of promise for the future of the series.",

Stealth is a hit and a miss, and once you get a sidekick you won’t even need to fight. Every locked door and reluctant bystander needs you to have an exact minimal stat to get by. The shooting is ♥♥♥♥ and the explosive will hurt you more than the enemies.  Every once in a while a horrifying glitch will either cause the game to crash or you to fall on the ground laughing. I was walking and I saw a bandit, sniped him in the face. His head exploded leaving only his eyes and he was still alive. He then turned and chased me like a horrifying game of tag. Killing people with a critical and an energy weapon leaves goo and ash piles, and sometimes they talk. The ground means little for the A.I. who frequently tilt until their head is under the ground.   Re-Playability: 1/1 There are a few good missions and unbelievable amount of glitches that demand your attention. With all the weapons and sidekicks to play with and setting up the stage for a series of slapstick physics fails.  should you buy it? Buy on sale, it's not going anywhere",

            "review_text": "When I first played New Vegas, my reaction was fairly lukewarm. I got the game when it was released back in 2010 for PS3. I was a 16-year-old kid who didn’t care about the story, nor could I really wrap my head around all of the political themes that pervade this game. I just wanted it to be more Fallout 3 where I ran around and made heads explode in V.A.T.S. In this regard, I was disappointed. The game’s story is much deeper than what is offered in Fallout 3. I got the Ultimate Edition 2 years ago during the summer sale because I never played the DLC and got it for ~$7. Since then it has become one of my most played games on Steam and one of my favorite games of all time, so I figured I should write a review and explain why I love this game so much.  New Vegas’s greatest strength is its understanding of player choice. Obsidian made an effort to make sure that you actually have multiple choices in most (if not all) scenarios. When most games think of choice, they think you have the freedom to be either the second coming of Christ, or Satan incarnate. They take a binary approach with no middle ground. I’m sorry for opening up this old flame war, but I would use Bethesda’s quest design as an example of the binary choice I’m talking about. Fallout 3 gave you the option of either being a goody-two-shoes, or a horrible monster who is the scourge of the wasteland. In New Vegas, you can tackle every situation in multiple ways depending on how you want to play the game. Maybe you can talk your way out with the speech skill, or pass a sneak check to avoid combat. Your skills and the character you decide to play truly matter in this game. The game is less focused on the karma system of Fallout 3, and, as a result, is not as limited. There is no one right answer to many of the problems in this game.  The gameplay and combat are adequate, but, admittedly, could be much better. It has shooting system that is standard for most games nowadays, where you can shoot from the hip or aim down the sights if you wish to be more accurate. It does a decent enough job, but it does not compare to other games with a more combat-heavy focus. Guns have almost no recoil and are laser accurate, which can get boring if you use automatics. Melee and unarmed are extremely viable and are probably my favorite way to play the vanilla game. They give the game a more Skyrim/Oblivion-type feel. You’ll have fun no matter what type of weaponry you choose to specialize in, but the gunplay does feel clunky at times.  The biggest problem with this game is that it can crash a lot. My crashes did not seem as frequent as some of the others that I have read about, but I still would save very often. The game has some goofy glitches too that can occasionally screw up quests too (thankfully, since this is the PC edition, you can fix broken quests with console commands). The technical issues come because the game was developed in only 18 months, reusing most of the assets from Fallout 3. That’s not an excuse, but it gives you an idea of some of the problems in this game.    Overall, there is tons of content in this game. My first PC playthrough clocked in around 70 hours, and that was even when I knew where I was going. It’s definitely worth the money, and still holds up today. If you haven’t already, buy it and see what all the hype is about.  5/5 --------------------------------------------  I also want to talk about mods, but didn’t want to let it impact my review. The mods in this game take what is already a great game and make it damn near perfect. As I mentioned before, the fundamentals of this game are solid, and mods expand on that. Additionally There are so many great ones out there, and people are still modding it today. Most of my playtime is probably from just going through the countless mods that are out there and seeing what is offered. They can fix some of the problems in this game, and end seemingly endless amounts of new content. If you play this game and don’t mod it, you’re missing out on the best part.  ***I must also mention that many people who buy this game lately are experiencing issues with crashing. This is due to a Windows update that broke something. If you roll back your video card’s drivers to the ones offered in July (368.81 for Nvidia users), everything should work fine. ",

Overall it's definitely worth buying, though gamers that have only played Fallout 3 may feel slightly off-put about how separated everything is when it comes to story and the setting. Game mechanics are more complex than it's Fo3 predeccessor and while that may discourage some players from playing, it will put the more hardcore player to the test.",

I really enjoyed Fallout 3, but New Vegas brought with it alternate ammo types, more weapons, faction standings, kooky humor (if you choose the 'wild wasteland' trait), and other numerous tweaks and refinements.   Add to that Bethesda's modding system and you've got a game that will surely take a week of your life. I always play through Bethesda games at least once with the vanilla version, and aftewrard load up mods. Mods like Project Nevada add fresh replay value.  Easily one of my favourites.",

Yes, unless you are a real Fallout Fanatic you never want to see that, but you don't have to. Also the four DLC Missions (Or I think they are ones, they have one maps and everything) sucks, one looks like a complete different game, which is good, anotherone is really boring, and the next looks good but there is guy talking things so stupid that you think 'What, where they out of Ideas?', the last crashed instantly. Can't say anything about it. But the main storry is rather good. Scenery, well I tell you you still need some imagination to make it perfect. But I like how this whole game can inspire you to imagine so many stories, and that is maybe the main reason the fan base is so big. But I tell you, you need to download a 3TB Texture Pack first or you will vomit because of those bad textures. The Whole Grafic in this is a pile of ♥♥♥♥, 2010? If it would be 2006 it would be good for that time, but no it is 2010. And they didn't had to make an example of good graphics like in CoD4 (Yes the grafik of 4 was awesome in its time, and alot better than of the newer ones, but that is another topic) but still for 2010. Also the gameplay kinda sucks for a shooter, I would like to holster 2 weapons at the same time, I know you can also swap the weapon anytime in the menu, but just for my fluent gameplay. Also alot of times you are 'jumpglitched' (I just invented it), means you cannot jump, for no reason. Also I hate games that call walking, running, at least slow walking is walking. But after a while you get used to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ controls. I won't lie to you, if you don't look for story, for looting and for aventuring new places without that the games tell you to do, so yea openworld expierience at it best, than leave this out, but actually you would never consider this if you would be interested in this game.

            "review_text": "Oh my gosh, I love Fallout...3! When I first got it at the blockbuster at the age of 14, I was like 'What the hell is this? Some sort of...first person...zombie...bandit shooter?' Then, when I began the game and was pushed through my black mom's thighs, my mouth was agape! I spend hundreds of hours in Fallout 3, just investigating and exploring and shooting and doing bad and good and all kinds of things! In fact, it's one of the few bethesda games I completed the main missions AND side quests (Except for that Rad Scorpion Cave thing...Screw that thing).  I was ready for Fallout New Vegas, I was just...so ready to love it! Then it came out. And I liked it. Okay, You are a courier in the mojave who get's their head blown in, and instead of running away from the guy who shot you in the head, you recover and go on a quest to complete your delivery, one way or the other. In the meantime, every single faction in the mojave looks to you and says,' HEY, JOIN US AND WE CAN GIVE YOU MONEY/WEAPONS/HUGS/WOMEN/MEN/GAMBLING/ARMOR/CLOTHES/A COIN WITH YOUR FACE ON IT.' Because...you are...a very talented courier who somehow got more powerful when you were shot in the head? I dunno, I just think being in a vault with your father being liam Neeson is a much more believable reason why people want you.  The good thing about Fallout New Vegas is that despite it's desert setting, it is a very interesting and complex enviroment to explore in. You can find little stories in how these happen, or why this or how that happened, and most of them are subtle and often just say 'It's the mojave, baby.'. I dig that alot in games. The characters are alot funnier and it gives off a more 'see what happens' kind of deal than FallOut 3, where you failing means the death of the Eastern Coast while what you do in Fallout New Vegas is almost petty and rather more about keeping the peace or creating chaos for you to profit from. It makes the factions system a lot more refreshing and a better fit then if they just went for another Washington DC thing. But the bad news? The game...is just long. I swear to god, I have created at least 10 characters in this game and only once did I get to the ending with them. The hoops you had to go through the actually do ANY of the endings just makes me cringe in how difficult is was. Often the game actually BREAKS during missons that have you do something due to Bethesda having some sort of hattred of players actually completing their games. They want you to EXPLORE, WHY STOP DOING THAT, MAN!? And sometimes a character just doesn't work, like the man who shoots you in the head is just boring and that plot thread doesn't do much, The guy who runs New Vegas is just kinda meh (The robots he commands are another thing, as they are just so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cool and funny. I mean, the cowboy dude should have been the one who actually ran things!) And the guy who runs New Vegas seems awfully similar to the big bad of Fallout 3. I mean, think about it! Just...think about it, okay?  DO I RECOMMEND THIS GAME: YES  While it is not as big of a thrill for me as Fallout 3, this game strives towards a new thing and does it well. The characters and setting are often fun, and the quests and general feel of the game is lighthearted and much more rewarding in many ways than to Fallout 3. Just don't expect to finish the main quest, as the ending is far too long and convulted.  SUGGESTIONS(FOR GAME DEVS): Go back to California and focus on a more civilized Fallout where you are a major leader in a community that slowly changes shape and becomes either a totalitarian paradise or a flawed democracy.

This is the same company of former Bioware developers who almost destroyed the Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic series with a subpar sequel. Obsidian claimed a lot of the problems with that game were because they had to rush it in time for Xmas and maybe they were telling the truth because I have to admit, Fallout New Vegas is a much better product than Fallout 3. A real pleasant surprise!   I enjoyed my first few days with Fallout 3, but it became boring very quickly. It almost reminded me of Oblivion. I enjoyed Morrowind, and I really enjoyed Skyrim, but I have yet to complete Oblivion because it bored me to tears. Fallout 3 had many of the same problems. Generic side quests, bleh weapons, boring landscapes.... Polished games for sure, but just a litle too generic in design to feel as alive as Fallout New Vegas or Skyrim, if that make sense.   Fallout 3 did have some cool offerings, but New Vegas really took the new Fallout engine by Betheseda to a whole new level. Crafting, better side quests, factions... and what I love most, the game doesn't feel scaled to your level as much as Fallout 3, and especially Oblivion did. If you go north where you first begin the game, you will die... quickly! If you go east, same thing. I love RPGs that don't try and scale the bad guys to your level and make you pay for exploring. I also enjoy New Vegas's hardcore option that makes it that much more challenging because both Fallout 3 and New Vegas are too easy on the standard mode. I know Fallout 3 has mods that offer hardcore, but I'm giving Fallout New Vegas credit for having it from the start. It's almost like Obsidian took a look at popular complaints and suggestions from Fallout 3 and did their best to add it to Fallout New Vegas. I played through this game at least twice before I took the plunge on user made modulars. And the mods for this game are VERY impressive! I recommend you check out Nexus Mods for a thorough collection, but be forewarned, you will have to do some heavy research online to make sure it all works right. There are some terrific sets of videos on YouTube developed by a British chap who will walk you through all the many utilities and popular mods for both Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas, if you're willing to spend the hours. There are certain mod installers, and even fixer-up utilities that are necessary if you're going to get the most impresive mods.   I can't say enough about this game. It really brought me back to Fallout after a 'meh experience' from Fallout 3, and has me eagerly looking forward to the sequel. I bought the Ultimate Edition on sale for about $4 on Steam's Summer Sale and it's one of the best bang for my buck games I've played in a while. Most of the DLC is pretty goood, with only one that I thought was straight up boring, but I'll let you decide and I would recommend you get all DLC as well as the best user rated mods at Nexus, since this game is not as supported on Steam's workshop as some other titles.",

The 4 story DLC are good, Old World Blues and The Lonesome Road being by far the best. Each new enemies, new perks, and new weapons.

My only gripe would be that Obsidian pushed the storytelling beyond the ability of the game mechanics – introducing multiple factions which - when you start to interplay them – can basically break the immersion and cycle of the game. This isn’t a fault of the game or the story telling, just that Obsidian (again) pushed the envelope too hard. And in game development that is no bad thing at all.  At over 550 hours played at the time of writing this, New Vegas is easily up there as one of the great games I’ve played of all time, and I don’t exaggerate. In 20 years time when we look back at the life cycle of the great games of this type from the past, and everyone will be talking about Fallout 3 and how great it was, remember New Vegas - because it was always a better game. 10/10",

On the other hand it is very nice to know that whatever faction you join, just by joining them or doing anything for them, other factions will like you better or not depending upon their relation with the aformentioned faction .

You get drawn in to the story, and you chose your path, with the proud NCR, the animalistic Legion or the historical House, they are all fantastic.   The guns feel great, and melee and unarmed are not underpowered, infact I did an unarmed run and it was amazing, I felt weak at first, but then I got some brass knuckles, learned some skills, got a ballistic fist, learned more skills and there was nobody who could best me.  V.A.T.S is great fun and an upper hand in battle. Some may call it a crutch but I call it fun.  The modding comunity is huge! (perverts) There are a ♥♥♥♥ load of great guns (Anything by millinea is amazing), armor, clothing, homes, shops, companions and even a wonderful conversion mod called Project Navada. Also if you feel NV does not have enough bare ♥♥♥♥ or exposed 'female south regions' then there are more than enough mods for that! (If that's what you want, no judging)  Those are just some of the pros, but there are no pros without cons. Vanilla game (No DLC no mods) there really isn't a 'home' or a 'base', somewhere to take a load off, but away stuff. There's a sh*tty apartment but that's just meh, there's a sh*ttier motel room. However you can just get a home mod, or have the DLC old world blues.  The desert starts feeling drab and boring after awhile.  Overall I would say this game easily makes my top 5 and is a must own for anyone. ",

There are two ways to play this game: to get the results you want, or to get the results that you deserve. From the start, the game personalizes your character to match you (if you answer truthfully and act like you would), or you act up however you want to get different ending. I mean who doesn't want to wreck some civillians with a chainsaw? ...Anyway. The game is super fun and every piece of DLC is definitely worth it. Get the Ultimate Edition, because all the DLC adds something significant to the story, introduces fun weapons and just makes the game even more bada**.  My only complaints are the game is buggy and crashes. For me, it would crash at least once a day. When it did crash (which was common), it would take me completely out of the game. Sometimes random NPCs would start following me or be hostile towards me. The game was so detailed and fun, however, I forgave the glitches. So stop reading and buy. NOW.",

Give me The Witcher 2 or Deus Ex 3 settings over massive open world design any day.  So with that in mind I enjoy Fall Out: New Vegas a fair amount and do think its a good game.  And if you dont go crazy on mods that you completely ruin game challenge, it does have a good playability.  For the record the mods I loaded up were  -Increase weight carry limit to 50,000 (some might call this a game breaker for them but if I dont get this mod all I would end up doing is getting over weight and moving very slowly till I get to store. There is a skill you can take that allows you to port to a known location while over weight so this mod is mostly for conveince and to stop wasting time.  - Change the armor of the hookers and strippers in NV to lingerie. Not a huge deal but the black tape X over nipples drove me crazy visually as was completely out of place for setting/enviroment of game. I dont need nudity persay but at least be more fitting then black electrical tape Xing each strippers and hookers boobs (American censorship sucks)  - loaded up a few p[layer housing but ultimately prefered the housing we already offered in game Over all the game has a better then FO:3 storyline, but its still minimal compared to scope of game. You make some great allies and what not but they do seem to be under utilized thus far Exploration is this games strongest point but I did find mysaelf getting burned out on exploration and taking long breaks to play other titles, before I came back to FO:NV. Ultimately a good game, not a great game. Put this same game in the hands of a CD Projekt RED (makers of the Witcher series) and the subtle changes to a stronger story, more fully fleshed out adult situations not limited or hampered by American censorship, and you would have an even stronger game. Personally Id rate it in the 7/10 area. and thats really quite a compliment when you consider Im not a fan of open world or shooter normally.",

But this review isn't really meant for the seasoned vets or gamers who already play the game and have gone through the gauntlet of problems Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas are known for. No, this review is for the gamer who's on the fence about purchasing this game or are just beginning and have succumbed to the crashes, freezes, and only god knows what else.   To be blunt, this game sucked right out the gate. CTDs were killing me, much like Fallout 3 did when I was playing it. But after going through the community forums, mods, YouTube videos and the like, I've pasted together bits-n-pieces to turn this game into a stable treasure. As god is my witness, I haven't had a crash since diligently repatching this game under the advisement of others. NONE. ZERO! Not only that, but there are no microstutters, freezes, pauses or glitches of any kind. The frame rate is remarkably stable at 60 fps although only 30 fps is really needed.   If I were given a scale from 1 to 10 to judge this game on 'pre-community' patches, I would give it a 4. The game in itself at launch is good but buggy and wrecked. It's as if it wasn't finished upon release. But i'm still a sucker for open-world gaming.   If I were given a scale from 1 to 10 to judge this game on 'post-community' patches, I would give it a 9. Yes, it's THAT good. The graphics (textures) are much better. The speed of the game is smooth and stable. The story flows along wihtout interfering with your personal playstyle. This is the way the game is meant to be played. The ONLY reason I took a point off is because of some bugs in the programming referring to quest. But to be honest, that's expected in a game of this sort. You'll come across that from time to time but is doesn't break the game or quest for that matter.   In closing, this is a gem, especially at this time when the game is offered at twenty bucks or less during steam sales. As I stated, I've played for 35 hours at the time of this review and can't wait to get back at it, but I haven't even REACHED New Vegas yet! I'm laughing as I type it. There is so much stuff going on...I can't even get to where I'm going without getting side-tracked by some wonderful missions. The characters are great too. They are even better then the crazy ones you run across in Fallout 3.   You must get your mods and edit your ini files to get the full uninterrupted enjoyment out of this game. Search the net and be diligent. You WILL be rewarded!   ",

I enjoyed the minor tweaks a lot more than I thought I would. The skills felt more rounded and perks felt much more valuable. In the end I will always come back to the Mojave for the stories. So many interesting characters to meet, stories to read and hear, and things to do. At 140+ hours I have still barely scratched the surface of this wild and amazing place.

New Vegas is often considered the superior game, due to it's tighter pacing and more interesting world and characters. Fallout 3 has more exploration and a bigger map though.  In the game you play as a mysterious courier who wakes up buried alive in a small town in the middle of the desert. All you remember is that you have to deliver a coin to the city of New Vegas and then the usual Fallout madness begins. The journey to New Vegas is filled with peril and several new factions are introduced along the way together with familiar ones like the Brotherhood of Steel.  What sets New Vegas apart from any other Fallout city is that it was reasonably undamaged when the bombs dropped and the city even still has electricity. When you do get to New Vegas, things get even messier as everything is not all it appears to be...  DLC  Dead Money. You play as a captive along with others at a casino and you must uncover it's legendary treasure Honest Hearts. Discover the true nature of the legendary Burned Man as you work with and fight primitive tribes. Lonesome Road. This takes the entire game full circle as you explore the canyons of the Divide Old World Blues. You become a lab rat in a maze of pre-war technology. Advice  The only true must-have is Old World Blues. It is absolutely fantastic. The rest are kind of hit and miss. Pick up the ultimate edition with all the DLC included if you find it on a sale though, as it is usually a deep discount. It was available for $4.99 during the Steam Summer Sale of 2013",

Unlike Fallout 3 your skill checks are Hard set, so if you aren't the level required by the time you run across the many, MANY one time chance skill checks you always fail, whereas fallout 3 let you slide by with your level determining a % chance to succede. Like fallout 3 the terminal hacking and lockpicking are hard set as well, so even if you're level 74 you can't attempt a level 75 lock or terminal. The main game has three major paths you can take in the main story, and a whole plethora of hidden side quests you can fail at a moments notice. The DLC stories are much more entertaining on the whole, some of them can be a headache first time through but the rewards are notably worth it in most cases. The game's 'hardcore' mode is it's biggest shining feature, but it has a tendency to get in the way for an ammo hoarder as ammo has weight to it, albeit teensy, it adds up fast, I once had over 300 lbs that I lost in ammo alone.

The result is an inspired and surprisingly disbelief-suspending setting that combines the Wild West with 1950s Las Vegas, whilst retaining Fallout's trademark post-nuclear world with mutants and raygun-gothic technology. The characters are far more memorable and the open world actually feels like a world - and not an artificial field of formulaic, neatly-organized POIs and busywork (ala Far Cry 3 or any modern Ubisoft game, for that matter.)  If you haven't played a Fallout game before - I wouldn't worry. Just dive in. The plot is self-contained and familiarity with lore from the previous games isn't really necessary, though it adds to the enjoyment of certain characters and quests.  Be warned however, that as this is an Obsidian game (built on an engine from Bethesda, no less) there are glitches, bugs and rough patches - though the game is hardly unplayable, and there's still tons of great mods that further polish this gem.   The DLC is also really good.",

Obsidian's signature impressive writing is quite noticeable here, especially when it comes to the half-dozen companions you meet, each of whom are wonderfully characterized with loads of dialogue and several quests related to them. Survival and an expanded crafting system go a long way towards making you feel like a badass just for living through another day in the wasteland, and the fact that each faction tracks your actions leads to much more interesting moral choices.  Really the only downside I can think of is that a lot of the new content feels visually out of place. Many of Obsidian's models are oddly low-detail and poorly rendered, and several of the new items are just facsimiles of real-world weapons and equipment, maintaining none of the previous games' retrofuturistic, alternate universe feel.   Overall though, the game is a massive improvement over its predecessors ( yes, all of them). Definitely worth it for any CRPG fan.",

The gamble of Speech was great in Fallout 3 and if I messed up I could simply reload and try again.   I think I'll stick with Fallout 3 since this game looks more polished, but its setting and change in game mechanics don't capture me one bit.  EDIT:  After finally getting into the game I'll add this:  It's just as buggy as Fallout 3 and like Fallout 3 the ending is very anti-climactic. However, I would say that your choices in this game affect the end game much more than in Fallout 3, which is a great change. Like I said though, it's buggy as hell and I had to have some console commands on standby just in case I ran into them.   The characters in this game are much more memorable, though. Boone was a favorite, as was ED-E. The amount of places to explore was much more limited than Fallout 3, I thought, but at the same time the amount of space to roam was far greater. So yeah, my opinion on this game changed a bit. But my personal enjoyment is still 5/10 or 6/10.",

Yes, unless you are a real Fallout Fanatic you never want to see that, but you don't have to. Also the four DLC Missions (Or I think they are ones, they have one maps and everything) sucks, one looks like a complete different game, which is good, anotherone is really boring, and the next looks good but there is guy talking things so stupid that you think 'What, where they out of Ideas?', the last crashed instantly.

But I like how this whole game can inspire you to imagine so many stories, and that is maybe the main reason the fan base is so big. But I tell you, you need to download a 3TB Texture Pack first or you will vomit because of those bad textures. The Whole Grafic in this is a pile of ♥♥♥♥, 2010? If it would be 2006 it would be good for that time, but no it is 2010. And they didn't had to make an example of good graphics like in CoD4 (Yes the grafik of 4 was awesome in its time, and alot better than of the newer ones, but that is another topic) but still for 2010. Also the gameplay kinda sucks for a shooter, I would like to holster 2 weapons at the same time, I know you can also swap the weapon anytime in the menu, but just for my fluent gameplay. Also alot of times you are 'jumpglitched' (I just invented it), means you cannot jump, for no reason. Also I hate games that call walking, running, at least slow walking is walking. But after a while you get used to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ controls. I won't lie to you, if you don't look for story, for looting and for aventuring new places without that the games tell you to do, so yea openworld expierience at it best, than leave this out, but actually you would never consider this if you would be interested in this game.  So go buy this awesome game, but don't cry I told you some parts are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as hell!.",

            "review_text": "He crept up the hill slowly, his duster jacket flapping in the Mojave winds. It was midday, but he had chosen to approach the run-down prison from the hill with the sun to his back, a tactical move. There would be no glare from the sun to betray his position and his trusted sniper rifle, and he had to make use of all of these things if he was going to come out of this alive, and paid. He had taken on a job to wipe out the inhabitants of the prison from the local pushover authorities, the N.C.R. In his opinion everyone out here in this god-forsaken place deserved a bullet between the eyes, but then who would be left to buy all the crap he acquired off the corpses of those stupid enough to either get in his way or become his target? Nah, better to pick the side with money and a possible means to get out of this hell hole, and wipe out the rest. As he reached the crest of the hill and looked down into the prison yard, he began to pick out many of his targets, gauging their threat level between who was closer, who had the bigger guns, and who was seperated and could be picked off quietly. 3 of the guard towers still stood, and the convicts who had taken over had made good use of these, pilfering the rifles within each and establishing their own watch. They would have to go first, being that they had the best line of sight to spot him, glare or none. He then turns on his V.A.T.S., allowing him to pick and choose his targets and their appendages. He has just enough V.A.T.S. points to kill all 3 watchmen, but only if he goes for clear headshots. The nearest two ping in around 85% successful hit chance, good odds for any wastelander, but the third being the farthest pings in around 46%.....A number he doesnt like. However the sun is just cresting over him in the sky, and within a few minutes he will have lost his celestial ally and gained a new enemy. He tells himself, now or never, lines up his shots, and engages his V.A.T.S. calculations. With lightning-quick reflexes, he fires his first shot, and quickly moves to the second target, having to trust in his aim to hit the first. Once the second bullet leaves the chamber, his sights quickly flash to the third target. He fires that last round, and watches it spiral its way towards the tower. Almost as if time itself decides to hold its breathe in anticipation of this moment, everything slows on the third round. It spins lazily over the courtyard, intent on the tower and its one sentient form. The watchman takes a drag off an old dirty cigarette he traded for from one of the other inmates, one last, long sweet drag, as his eyes suddenly spend a fraction of a second seeing his two fellows in the other towers going down, and his ears hearing 3 shots. His eyes widen, just a fraction, in dread knowing where that 3rd shot was meant to go. The bullet pierces his skull, straight into his cranium, ricocheting inside his head until it explodes with force out the back, causing his head to explode outwards. The wastelander watches with satisfaction, now happy that he had chosen that Lady Luck perk, because she was surely watching over him today with that shot. However, he then hears a growl from behind, turns around quickly and immediately dismisses any notion of Lady Luck giving a rats ♥♥♥ about him. Standing before him is a Deathclaw, one ugly reptilean son of a ♥♥♥♥♥, standing 8 ft tall, with burning eyes staring right at him. Swearing loudly, he switches to his plasma gun which is falling apart and seen better days. His V.A.T.S. at the moment are depleted, so this will have to be all skill. Just before he charges in, he thinks to himself '♥♥♥♥ this deathclaw, ♥♥♥♥ this prison, ♥♥♥♥ the N.C.R., and ♥♥♥♥ this whole desert'. 10 out of 10. Buy it now or Grandma will call you and say she hates you.",

The reason I skip over console versions of most rpgs either made or produced by Bethesda is for the modding potential.  The stand-alone game, Fallout New Vegas, is very fun to play with many base weapons to choose from and factions to join. There are countless ways to replay this game over and over, and that possibility becomes almost infinite thanks to the modding community.  Yes, the game is full of glitches in the beginning when you purchase the vanilla game. But you can download many community patches that fix an untold amount of issues. Don't like that you heard there is cut content? Several modders are developing patches that will bring back cut content such as quests, weapons, and characters.  I feel especially that some of the factions feel meaningless, such as Caesar's Legion. It was rumored that faction had almost equal quests and depth as the NCR and offered many followers. But this was one of the largest cuts to NV that I saw an issue with, as Obsidian ran out of time and villified the Legion so no player would see how lackluster they were. There are mods that fix that, too, and others on the way still.",

No need to worry about things getting complicated though, since the Nexus Mod Manager and similar tools make it very easy.   Thematically it's a mashup of 1940s-1950s Sci-Fi meets post-apocalyptic, with just a dash of Western. I admit Fallout 3 has a better environment since you're exploring the bombed-out ruins of Washington DC versus the open Mojave desert, but the mechanics are improved and the game itself is optimized for modern operating systems. Fallout 3 on the other hand will put up a fight if you're running Windows 7 or 8.  In the end, I'd say New Vegas is a solid RPG, it just needs a few mods to have it reach its full potential. Definitely worth your time and money, especially on sale.",

This game is an outstanding experience except for it's notoriously horrendous performance issues (crashes, freezes, etc.) and just general bugs. I love this game, and would recommend it, I would also recommend getting the 99 cent 'Courier's Stash' DLC, the armor, weapons, and stimpaks help tremendously. I would not however recommend expecting a smooth experience. You must be willing to deal with constantly being interrupted for stuttering, freezing, and crashing at random and quite frustrating times (namely when you haven't saved in a while.) That being said, once again, this is an amazing game, with loads of quests and places to explore, things to fight, people to interact with, and even drugs to become addicted to, you will never be bored in the Mojave.  Want to relax, maybe have a drink? Plenty of bars and lounges for that. Want to gamble your savings away? New Vegas has some great casinos too. Or maybe you want to just kill stuff? Well there's certainly no shortage of that. All in all: 8/10, save frequently, have patience, and enjoy.",

I now actually travel between Fallout 3 and New Vegas via a train from Freeside in NV to an unknown or undiscovered station in D.C. called Columbia Station.

Some of them are tolerable, even if they take away from the sense of immersion, but the constant crashing on loading screens gets old pretty quickly. This is, overall, a very good game, but if I could give advice to people who have not played it and are considering it, it is this: Catch it on sale. I payed nine dollars for it and all of the DLC.

I have found it impossible to choose an optimal path through the maze of interconnected stories and choices (made even worse by a variety of skill requirements that affect the choices available). In some cases my feeling was not one of accomplishment, but of exhaustion and relief that it was finally over and I had a good excuse to work a different quest or even play some other game. The quests seem far more manageable once the main quest is over and after 200 hours I can't say that the game isn't engaging. It is.

You start as a courier who's had the misfortune of getting your package stolen, in the process, you end up shot in the head, buried, and left for dead, however you wake up rescued and now you want answers. Two factions are vying for power, Caesars Legion and the New California Republic, other smaller tribes and factions are not to be discounted of course. How you deal with all these different groups is your choice.  Pros: Open World Design Dozens of minor quests Fun Mini Games Great Character Progression and Customization Weapon Customization System Improved Companion System (Bonus Points for getting real life famous entertainer Mr. Las Vegas AKA Wayne Newton to play Radio host Mr. New Vegas) Awesome Modding Community for PC users keeping the game alive  Cons: Lack luster plot (even main quest and dlc in my opinion) Poor Optimization for windows 7 and up Only truly open world at later levels due to 'walls' of high level enemies blocking many areas off. Short main story quest line  Now while it is difficult not to compare it to the admittedly superior Fallout 3 (in my opinion).

Bottom line is, this game is a masterpiece. I know that the quality control of Bethesda dropped when they gave obsidian the role of coding New Vegas and there are a lot more graphical problems and some game breaking glitches. But whether you like a game or not you must look past a games faults. I passonately play the fallout franchise. I clocked this game 4 times on xbox 360, once on hardcore. I couldn't stop. I love getting lost in a role playing character whether I take on the persona of a caring wasteland dweller, helping the civilisations inhabitants or a physcotic manic with no respect for anyone. This is what makes me love fallout so much. Not only is the story for both games amazing but the setting is even better. Something about post-apocolyptic senarios just get me like no other setting does. Now I will admit, the combat and features in New Vegas are a huge step up from Fallout 3. Even the ability to have full iron sights is a huge improvement, but a even further extention to the crafting system and new weapon modifications mean that there is a lot more to do in NV than 3. To be perfectly honest if you want to play a falloput game for a story, pick 3 over NV any day. NV story is a bit short and the final battle at Hoover Dam, no matter who you side with, once you have completed the finale, you will be sent back to your last save before the battle which in my personal opinion is dumb. I would have loved to continue on after the cut scene narrator has finished explaining what actions you took affected the wasteland. If you side with Caesar's Legion, the narrator will explain how the legion took over the strip and practically wiped out the NCR from Vegas, so it would have been great to roam the fully Legion controlled Vegas.  All in all if you want more from what you got from Fallout 3, purchase this game and its dlc's you will not be disappointed!",

There was a few issues at first... Mainly focused around the feeling of boredom in Goodsprings, that I still feel today. However past that point of getting used to the game and out of Goodsprings I love it.  It was a brilliant year for game-play, in 2012, and Fallout New Vegas sat as one of the highest quality games in terms of RPG, at least for me. I loved nearly every bit of it. I fell in love with that 50's feel mostly, with the music just capturing me completely. But the humour behind it, the funky features, unique range of weapons, completely customizable set up and huge world made my love for it an addiction. I even enjoyed the DLCs that gave a nice break to the Mojave scenery.  There was a few bugs and glitches, but not when I have swapped over to PC from Console and covered every inch of the game with mods, it runs like a beautiful well loved &amp; oiled machine.  It needs these mods, trust me as the graphics don't meet that expected of 2015, but over-all it's still my favourite game of all time, and my reason for love of retro 50's stuff &amp; MMO's.  My only wish is that more games these days offered this high quality. Bring on Fallout 4!",

My only real disapointment with New Vegas was that weapon crafting seemed a bit dumbed down, VERY limited selection of craftable weapons, and the ones that you can craft will need to wait till mid game before you get the items required.

The reason I say attempting, is the console versions tend to freeze &amp; lock up after a couple of hours of gameplay. On PC however the game runs much more smoothly &amp; if your system can handle it, I would highly recommend getting the 4GB memory mod from Nexus Mods, as it will allow up to 4GB of your RAM to be dedicated to Fallout NV while playing, making the game run that much more smoothly.  My only real complaint with NV is, I played it for the first time about 9 months after beating Fallout 4 multiple times, &amp; I would honestly recommend playing it BEFORE Fallout 4 if you can, otherwise the power armor is going to seem quite.... underwhelming in comparison.  In NV the graphics for it are lackluster &amp; it literally looks like a poorly skinned set of football pads, compared to an suit that you have you unlock &amp; climb into (like in Fallout 4). Otherwise, I found New Vegas to be much more challenging even on the lesser difficulties than Fallout 4 ever was, as I always attempt to play through the game the first several times without mods, &amp; replay it on each difficulty setting, for each different faction ending, before I feel comfortable using Mods or console commands (which is essentially cheating).  After owning this on both PS3 &amp; PC, I would highly recommend the PC version over getting it for PS3 / X360. Even on a mid range graphics card like a single GTX 960, it's considerably more crisp &amp; 'pretty' as far as graphics &amp; gameplay go.  I'm still debating getting the PC version of Fallout 3 GOTY. I remember on consoles it seeming very brown &amp; dark pretty much everywhere, I'm not sure how much of a difference PC will make, but most people in the forums already say you're better off just getting New Vegas &amp; 4 (if your system will run it).  I honestly found that New Vegas was much more challenging even on lower difficulty settings than Fallout 4 was on considerably higher difficulties. Some people may or may not like that. Personally I love / hate it, lol. It definitely adds a level of realism to the game that more hardcore gamers will appreciate.",

Unless Obsidian makes another FO game based on FO4 this will probably be the last FO game I play. I wouldn't call FO:NV stellar but it's a solid game with the addition of mods. Still has some of that inherent bethesda bugginess to it. Again better with mods like the community bug patches. Which is sorta mind boggling isn't it? You don't buy a car, find a bug in it's navigation system, and then look to the community for a fix... you go back the dealership and run it up the ladder in the hopes that they actually support their product. Anyway the main story is passible. The narrative suffers a bit from the number of choices. Quantity vs. Quality per se. I have the most fun just exploring and doing the side stuff. Did I mention there's some great mods?   As for DLC I'd have to say Old world blues is best of them. Dead money isn't bad. Honest hearts is meh.   Unlike FO4 you have karma in this game, you have a level cap, and skills. You can't build a jack of all trades master of all imba toon. There's actual replay value in trying out different character builds. I don't own FO4 and won't even consider it until Bethesda releases the mod tool. There's still a chance they'll try to pull what they did with Skyrim with paid for mods. Which, I'm not inherently against so long as they are paid for from day one (which we are technically past), and Bethesda doesn't dare try to charge us for bug fixes the community puts out. I mean sure I'll send a few dollars to the people doing it for their hard work but Bethesda doesn't deserve a DIME of it. It's their game to support. Ideally they'd patch their crap so we didn't have to do it for them.  In summary - Great game from Obsidian. It's too bad Bethesda has to be a part of it.",

It has an excellent story that doesn't tie you into family nor previous vault obligations, leaving you to be the sole narrator of your own playthrough. There's so many different kinds of endings, and they're all in-depth. The clothing is more diverse, the weapons and modifications are revamped, and morality/karma has no influence on who gets to buddy up with you. I like that all the companions can be collected into a weird family of sorts. Though it's a desert, at least the area given makes sense for the amount of decay and dead color schemes.  The only real qualm I have with this game is the inital customization, which has been kind of terrifying and weird during this era of their game engine.

There are weapon mods, armor mods, quest mods, npcs, locations, and much more. On the nexus, there are mods that range from simple bug fixes to entire graphical overhauls!   And as for gameplay, it is rather straight foward. You can shoot people (or smash them to bits with a sledgehammer), make friends with random tribes found in mountains, befriend the freakin military, or just try to take it all in for yourself.

Much more accesible than Fallout 3 with improved UI, Weapons, weapon modding, companions, and Faction notoriety. The Ultimate edtion with all the DLC is also worth the buy, since it nearly tripples the content. The game even though set in a Distopian Las Vegas and South West is still very much a fallout game. So expect all of the fun and weirdness of Fallout set in the West. There are a few odds and ends that hold the game back like some repetitiveness, not saving can set you back hours, the default radio stations which will drive you insane and the fact you can't continue the game after finishing the story questline unless you mod the game. Still a huge game to play through dlc included, and what I love is no two play throughs are the same.  This review is a bit over due seeing New Vegas has been out for a good 6 years now, but if you still haven't played it, are new to Fallout, looking for a an older Fallout, or just want to replay it; New Vegas is a good place to start.

I feel inspired to keep expanding my game design skills every time I play so I guess thanks are in order!  Pros: - Great graphics - Smooth and always fun gameplay - Exiting death animations - Variety of wepons - Awsome map - Great dialog options  Cons: - Lots of bugs and glitches. - Crashes completly randomly, even on a amazing computer. - I feel this game comes no where neer to how good Fallout 3 was. Starting from the beggining at birth was way better than: we fixed you, here is a bunch of crap, go start questing and killing sh**. - Really bad resolutions for windowed mode.  Constant Bugs and Glitches: - Buttons on pip boy somtimes wont work and I have to click around tell they work. - Dialog and menu buttons dont work often and there is no way to fix without closing the game sometimes. (but you cant f***ing close the game without the dialoge options (even control + alt + delete wont work while in game!) so you have to restart.) - Many random crashes that drive me crazy on every computer I have used. - There are more but I cant think of them at the moment.

            "review_text": "Writing's on the Fall  What's the link between these 3 excellent games ? Fallout New Vegas, Pillars of Eternity, and South Park the Stick of truth ? The developper Obsidian entertainment ! They just rule for good story telling. While i was looking for my first sales on Steam, i really wanted the top of the basket, reading gamers reviews. This one was in my list, and it just became my favorite FPS ever. Period. Since the beginning, my character got immersed in one of the most dark story. And i also discovered an open world suiting very well exploration / levelling playstyle.  What this Fallout has, compared to the others ? - The western style (not being fan of the genre) adds some colors to this game, with fabulous musics, and a shiny New Vegas city. Even some shelters are totally designed in a unique way that you haven't seen before. - 'Old' game they say ? I love to answer 'cheap' :) - Weaponry, companions, factories, factions, choices, achievments or caps games are my favorites of all the saga.  Why should you play this game, as when you read this it rains, you smashed your little toe against a door, and the world itself screams at you 'NO WAY. YOU CAN'T TAP THAT'.  =&gt; You should play it for all these reasons.  Of course my playtime isn't as impressive as other hardcore gamers, but i'm still progressing for my achievments 1 and half year after i bought it. Still many things to discover, and i want to improve my skills template also. Seriously thinking about the DLC also.  My last argument : 10€/$ for a movie of 2 hours, with 30mn of advertising.  10€/$ (2,5 on sales) for a Fallout NV of 50 hours minimum, with much more advertising for Nuka Cola !",

Having played every incursion of Fallout stemming back to the original game I'm somewhat of a loyalist to the series, especially so to the first two. In my opinion FO NV is the first 'modern times' instalment of the game that does the the original two justice. It is quite simply a masterpiece of gaming excellence, well-crafted, well-written, well-voiced, with highly interesting and very imaginitive storylines, histories, back-stories, the humor, the horrors, etc.   We're never going to have the same 'feel' or 'moodiness' as the originals had, but perhaps it's better that those originals stay just that... original. I very much like the mood and feel of NV too.   On the technical side, for those of you who are now on Windows 10 (like me) I can tell you that the game plays quite well. I'm running it on the absolute most ultra-high settings and I'm experiencing few crashes. It does crash, but so too does virtually every game I've ever played. As for glitches, seeing as it's an older game most if not all of the known bugs are well-documented online along with any fixes or work-arounds.  My recommendation for what it's worth:   As I said NV is now an older game, and thus sold at a discounted price, and comes with the entire DLC package (set of 4), and I've found it to be so worth the money. Getting and playing the four add-ons is a must. If I were to rate it out of 10 I'd give it at least a 9, perhaps 9.5.  Happy gaming.",

            "review_text": "originally published September 13th 2011  Fallout:New Vegas is a slow burn but not in an awesome roast-a-pig-in-a-backyard-firepit kind of way, more a boil-a-frog kind of way. So much time is invested that by the time it's over a beaten down Stockholm Syndrome sets in, goading the player to make it to the pay-off to justify the time investment.   As The Courier (when you are actually one of many couriers) you start the game in a grave, a bullet lodged in your skull. Rescued by a overly friendly robot (that conveniently shows up all over the place), The Courier is mended by a small-town doctor and set out into the world with a single quest-find the man that betrayed him/her.  Like Fallout 3 (and on the same engine) F:NV drops the player into an open world from the beginning, but firmly guides through quests and rewards. As an action RPG, leveling deeply affects the ability to travel from environment to environment as various flora and fauna as well as enemies are placed to deter much off-the-beaten-path travel.  This wide-but-still-a-corridor approach pushes the player into a variety of environments suitable to their level and as diverse as an abandoned town,a Vault, an abandoned farm, a ruined town filled with survivors (good/bad/one with the gun) and Vegas. This also serves to level and equip the player enough to surive the end-game with in New Vegas itself and where the meat of the story really is.   What began as a simple revenge tale ramps up in the last 10 hours to a tale of political power and intrigue as the Courier is given leave to aid or destroy various factions in the world. These choices determine the future of New Vegas itself and the surrounding lands. The meandering journey around the city informs these choices but for me, there was only one clear path, as none of the factions are particularily interesting or endearing.  Presented as an attempt to empathize with the plight of various peoples, F:NV is such a slog that the endless dialogue trees and barely animated charaters blur into one another, including the player companions. I encountered all of them, and while I saw the benefit each might bring as one of the two allowed, I found none to be very interesting. I ended up keeping a robot and a dog for most of my travels.  Only in that last part of the game does the momentum build, including a truly shocking (and entirely optional moment) involving would-be dictator Mr. House. Only then does the game find its legs and move the story forward, barrelling towards a deliciously violent conclusion.  Obstensibly a first-person shooter, I spent most of my gameplay time in 3rd person mode unless I was in combat. Once engaged with enemies, I immediately made use of the VATS targeting system, highlighting specific body parts to damage. Less a shooter than a dice-rolling RPG, F:NV relies entirely on stats to effect damage rather than player skill. Scoring critical hits in VATS never fails to be viscerally fulfilling as an enemy explodes into gore.  This game is very very brown   Visually a brown and yellow color scheme matches the locale of the nevada desert but it also undermines the previously established and far more striking look of Fallout 3. By using muted earth tones, the game just looks like mud, until New Vegas is reached, at which point it looks like neon-colored mud.  It is also replete with glitches, even this late into release and after multiple patches. Usually spawn or clipping issues, I never experienced anything game breaking, but it was hilarious to disarm an enemy, then have him run himself into a corner and up into the sky.  Like Bioshock 2, Fallout:New Vegas takes a long time to get cooking and engage the player. Unlike Bioshock 2, the visuals are not a hook to keep the player involved until the story ramps up. For those that relish exploration and discovery, New Vegas has some delightfully oddball areas that are quirky enough to keep one engaged, but those seeking narrative have a long road ahead.",

Don't even get me started about what I think Fallout 4 should have been...  With that out of the way, allow me to say this: I'm not a huge fan of RPGs. In fact, I used to hate RPGs, but all this changed when I decided to immerse myself into the lore of the Fallout universe, after reading about it online. What got me a bit into the world of RPGs was Fallout 1 and 2, and subsequently, 3 and NV (Mass Effect as well, I guess, but that's outta the question...). The fact is, I tried a few other RPGs from time to time since I started playing Fallout, but none of them got me as hooked as did Fallout: New Vegas. I have, at the moment I'm writing this review, 126.5 hours counted towards it, but all these hours were achieved on a single character, on a single storyline. There are countless more possible unique endings to this game than I guess I could have achieved with all the hours I have put in to all my Steam games put together.  Now, to the game itself, more exactly, to the story. As I suppose I made quite explicit in my previous paragraph, this game is huge. Like, really, it's very long (provided you decide to finish not only the main quest, but at least SOME side-quests, like I did. Trust me, the writing on those makes them worth your time). It appears to me that Obsidian, the company responsible for the development of this game, (which, mind you, had some of those involved in the development of Fallout 1 and 2) really took their time to make a clever and engaging storyline(s). You will see that in many points you will have to make decisions that could affect the entire Wasteland, as, to a certain degree, your actions do carry weight in this game.  For gameplay and character development, I fell that, for a game from 2010, its gameplay is still pretty good, although it is, at times, 'clunky'. I, for one, didn't enjoy fighting in real time, for example. For combat, VATS was my method of choice, but I'm sure there are many that beg to differ. It also introduced a (in my opinion) rudimentary crafting system that I barely used, but that certainly gives many different advantages to those that do. The game's character development is as awesome as is the story, and closely intertwines with the gameplay. The skill system, combined with many perks that can be given to your character, alongside a diverse range of equipments make for a virtually limitless number of possible character builds.  Finally (because I really wanna sleep, but at the same time wanna help you folks lol), the graphics. Look at the game's screenshots, that's all I have to say. Good night.  tl;dr:  PROS: -Story (3x) -Gameplay -Character development (2x)  CONS:  -Graphics",

I previously, as abhorent as it may sound to PC elitsists, owned this game on the Xbox 360 and clocked in well over 1,000 hours across several save files. I've a bit less experience with a modded version of this game, but I played with most of the mods that you could with Tale of Two Wastelands, which I recommend.  I strongly recommend this game which, in a post FO4 world, is easily the strongest entry in the series, surpassing the original two games, Fallout 3, and even Fallout 4. The world feels much more alive, even if at times the environments can be sparser than Fallout 3 or 4, due to stronger writing and world building. The factions within it feel like they're reacting and coexisting within the world rather than remaining in their separate bubbles without any acknowledgement of the others, besides perhaps 'You see that huge scary ship in the sky? Crazy right' from the rare extra. I would also argue this is an excellent 'Jumping in' point for the series as it includes all of the standard factions as well as some unique ones, though the Brotherhood of Steel is a weaker player in this game than most of the other entries.  It manages to, in my opinion, balance RPG and FPS elements in a way that both Fallout 3 and 4 failed to succeed in, besides perhaps the clever addition of energy weapons ironsights that was included in Fallout 4. The difficulty feels rather balanced, as well, and lacks the rather ridiculous 'Poor a million bullets into a Deathclaw' sequence that Fallout 4 has right at the intended start of the game.  tl;dr  Pros:  Excellent worldbuilding  The peak example of writing in the series  Easily the best entry in the series, you'll never experience anything as good as playing this for the first time when it comes to this series  Unique characters and factions  Great gameplay  Cons:  It's a Bethesda/Obsidian game, it's still a bit buggy.  Easily the best entry in the series, you'll never experience anything as good as playing this for the first time when it comes to this series  Due to the game's size, the voice acting cast is low and you tend to hear Yuri Lowenthal eight times in one room.

That dream was achieved on October 25th, 2013, when I bought a pc capable of running New Vegas at max settings. I modded this game until its engine buckled under the weight of everything I threw at it, and kept going. Every single experience is different, and incredible. I've charged through hordes of super mutants in my custom made base, firing a mini nuke mini gun, watching my armies of enclave soldiers charge into the expanding glow. I've flown a vertibird over the north end of freeside and new vegas, destroying roaming gangs of zombies that ravaged the landscape. I've taken a train ride to to the Capital wasteland bringing two amazing titles together, thanks to the ambitious community that loves this series more than I do. This game is buggy, it is abstract, it is chaotic, and it is a masterpiece. This is a title that I will come back to 20 years from now, even when the other mountains of titles that surpass it mechanically and graphically stand ready, because it has proved itself to be one of the most memorable and captivating games I have ever experienced.

The GOTY version was 4-5$ and that should be the recommended price. The only way you should pay full price for this is if a bethesda worker comes to your house and installs all the essential mods that prevent chrashing. The story is nice, there is hidden funny ♥♥♥♥ everywhere, guns are cool and the gameplay is fun (when it works properly). 7/10",

This Fallout game is the best of the modern Fallout games (Modern as in: Fallout 3 and Fallout 4) in my opinion. I'll try to keep this review short.  This game focuses heavily on role-playing, world building, and it makes sure that your choices truly impact the game as a whole. The majority of your choices if not all of your choices will have some impact on the game world. Your choices do matter and make a difference unlike other games that give the illusion of choice, this game actually gives you it and makes you live with the consequences. Even the downloadable content gives you choices to make as well as new areas, characters, items, and ethical ideas to think about even after you finish the game. This game also does a great job in avoiding a 'Good vs. Evil' story like Fallout 3, and it makes sure to put everyone in the grey area in which all factions have good sides and arguments for their actions as well as flaws that are major and minor. This is also a game in which years later I am still finding new areas, easter eggs, quests, interesting characters, and even new ways to play!  To simply put it, I highly recommend this game and all its downloadable content. The only way to truly understand the complexity of this game is to play it multiple times in different ways and make difference choices. Again, buy this game and make sure to give yourself a enough time to really get into it.",

You can be a mercenary, a good-two-shoes, a bumbling idiot, whatever you want to try and the best part you see the results of your choices play out either for good or bad. It gets better when the game introduces factions and how your actions towards them can make them love you, hate you, or unsure whether to trust you if you play neutral, there is also some additional stuff like wearing the outfit of a faction blends you in with them as long as you don't get too close to where they can tell you're a fluke which makes for some fun moments. The companions in this game have gotten better, what I mean is they have a more detailed backstory as well as quests that decide their fate at the end and although sometimes their AI can be stupid at times, they have saved my hide multiple times. The companions also have a companion wheel to quickly give actions and change settings which was a good step from 3. The gunplay has gotten a bit better but nothing too different from 3. All in all Fallout New Vegas has a lot of heart in it and it really deserves to be played at least once, and like I said you can play anyway you want heck I convinced the final boss to call it quits and go home...and the sucker listened to me!",

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.    No but seriously this is a great game stop debating it and get it, you must get ulitmate edition for perfection though",

Unlike the latest Bethesda title (which I still find highly enjoyable), FNV is an actual RPG game. With a level cap and thus a limit on perk/stat points, how you spend those points makes a big difference in terms of gameplay.  FNV features multiple major and minor factions, each with their own unique quest lines that can be tied into the main story line. With memorable NPCs and amusing dialogue, it does not feel like a chore to complete.  Modding is a large selling point for this game. Almost all aspects of the game can be tailored in some way by mods. If you can think of something to mod, chances are, there is already a mod for it. FNV has one of the largest modding communities of any game and because of that, there are thousands of mods to choose from. Some of them changes major parts of the game, while others changes minor details. Clothing/armor mods add variety and additional character customization. Weapon mods makes combat more interesting. Visual mods such as ENBs, better textures or enviromental mods makes the rather dated graphics more appealing. There are NPC mods, quest mods and mods that add new areas to name a few.  To me, Fallout: New Vegas is the best Fallout game to date. With high replayability, it is more than worth it's $10 asking price. $20 for the Ultimate edition (recommended), which adds additional items and three new maps with engaging stories. I stress this even more so when it's on sale, at which point, there isn't a reason not to try out the game unless you absolutely can not spare three to five dollars.",

You can join every single one of them and most aren't black or white decisions, they're always grey areas and that's important. Only real black or white faction in the game is the NCR and the Legion and even those are great fun to participate in.  A brand new story will have you start out in a small town called Goodsprings and work your way up all the way to New Vegas with tons of twists and turns along the way. The story in NV respects the lore a lot more than 3 as well.  There's new weapon modifications that let you upgrade the already vast amount of weapons you can use including lots of rare and unique weapons along the way.  The modding community is alive, always creating great mods to keep this game alive for as long as possible.  Probably my favourite addition is how no enemies can't be killed. You can just straight up kill everyone if you wanted to.  The only thing holding Fallout New Vegas back is the bugs. Although the game breaking bugs were all patched out at release there's still lots of small annoying ones that will ruin your immersion and can mess you up on a lot of side quests. Combine that with constant crashing on certain people's systems and those can ruin a game for some people.  9/10, undoubtedly my favourite game in the series and probably my favourite RPG. Nothing can top this. The game would probably be a 10/10 if the bugs were fixed. I don't usually do scores and if I did I wouldn't give high ones like this often but I can't stress enough how much I love New Vegas and how if you haven't played it yet, you need to. Now.

If not for the glitches I would probably have more like 300 hrs in this game, so I can not in full recommend this game. All I can say is if you do buy it make sure to turn off your autosave( this stops most of the crashes) and SAVE SAVE SAVE.

            "review_text": "Fallout: New Vegas is, in my opinion, the definitive Fallout experience  For fans of the old isometric Fallout style, it's quirky and original dialogue and compelling storytelling as well as its freedom of choice and true RPG gameplay, this three dimensional edition of the classic series is as close as you'll get. Whilst Fallout 3 certainly introduced the mechanics we've come to expect in a modern day Fallout game, New Vegas innovates on them, adding flavour and variety to the otherwise cut and paste formula.  The allocation of skills and the dedication to your build feels more consequential here, and investing points into specific areas offers unique rewards depending on how you spec. This is something the newest entry, Fallout 4, failed to recreate, amongst other things.  Dialogue and interaction is fun, engaging and almost always unique. No two, important characters feel the same, and although the entire cast is voice acted by a very select group of actors (as is customary of a Bethesda game), most are memorable and impressionable on your playthrough. This, I feel, is one of the most important components of a Fallout game; How immersed do I feel? New Vegas strikes this balance between quirkiness and weighty decision-making perfectly, and what you end up with is a living, breathing world.  Story-wise, there is a surprising amount of depth and choice involved in the events of the world and your character. You are a courier, a nobody, and unlike other entries in the series, you start fresh, out in the wasteland without a vault in sight. You are given the option to be who you want to be, which is something I can really appreciate after playing through Fallout 4. Factions are introduced as a core mechanic in New Vegas and they essentially determine your characters path trhough the story and their allignment, but it goes beyond good and evil. There are a lot of morally grey decisions to be made, sacrifices to deal with and inevitably, you're going to have regrets about the things you do. It's a joy over and over and over...  I'm going to have to say this, gameplay is certainly New Vegas's weak point. In many instances, you'll either be talking your way out of something, or shooting. Whilst there is something to be said for the sheer volume of weaponry and the methodic VATS assisted dismemberment of your foes, it gets stale pretty quick, especially in the later levels. You'll probably find that abusing the enemy AI is the best way to fight and that hitting more, hitting often is always the best stategy. The difference between a plasma rifle and a semi-auto assault rifle is in the sound it makes, the puddle of goo it leaves and the blood it spills, but realistically, dispatching your enemies is consistent throughout.  Graphically, New Vegas hasn't exactly aged well. Fortunately, it's visual style and complex, memorable world design is engaging enough that you'll either fail to notice, or you'll care very little. The controls are agreeable and highly customisable, and a hotbar feature exists to quickly switch between your weapons and items.  Oh, and unlike Fallout 3, this game is a lot more functional on modern hardware.  I'd recommend solely based on replayability alone, but this game offers a lot more and is well worth the price.",

I myself love this game with a burning passion. The story is amazing. The level up system isn’t has well as fallout 3 with a perk every level instead New Vegas as one perk every level (but mods can fix that up). The characters like Benny or Mr. House are great developed characters. The DLCs are probably the best part of the game when it comes to adding more backstory to the lore of your courier and companions or pervious installments. The parts of the game I disliked the most is the fact that the enemies like Deathclaws or Cazadors are just over powered and can kill you in one hit or a few if you encounter a group of them. The other part I disliked was some of the quests and the over the top demands (ex. You need to find one guy in all of the wasteland for a hooker that wants out of that business and to run away with that guy who she was in love with but was banned from the family she works for so you have to find him)",

To simply put it, good rpg but bad game. Like many people that've played NV, I've had my share of bugs. Lots of them still in the game in fact which is odd for a title this old. The world, even though it's beautiful in its unique way, turns quickly ugly and boring. There is a LOT of brown in this game, more than an actual desert. The only places with some color are Jamestown, New Vegas and the Vault with the plants. Other then those places, it's so...ugly.   As much as I love the NCR, Legion and all the other characters in the game the world still feels dead and barron. Many areas of the map don't have any creatures in it, creating awkard silent moments where you can truely see how alone you are in the game. There is random encounters but they are few and far in between. Really, everything is tucked into small pockets of the world. Cities and some important spots with items are really the only places with creatures.   As an RPG, the game is damn good. You can be what you want, when you want. Skills tie in to the speech system. If you are a doctor and are good a medicine, then you can help some people with that skill when talking to them. Its nice and it helps with the immersion of self-character.   Besides that, the game is horrible to play. Combat is just a bore and is more like a chore than anything else. It feels stiff and honestly, like goldeneye from N64. Also, you can become stupid strong real fast in the game just by having your specials maxed out for Intel and Luck. You'll have all skills to 100 before level 25 and be doing crit damage all over the place.   All in all, Fallout: NV just feels rushed and 'watered down' compared to other games. As a rpg, its great to a point but as a game, it's horrid to play repeatedly. It quickly becomes dull, even with mods (and I've modded mine to hell and back). If you love RPGs then yeah, pick it up. the game is dirt cheap now but prepare for freezes and crashes and a broken skill system.",

The game has a bug which tells me to go and have a word with the man whos head I blew off from over 130 yards earlier.   I go up to his body, the quest marker is still there... I take his helmet.. quest marker still there.. I go up to his tent and attempt to enter (a tent mind you) and it's barred from the other side...   If you're playing for the story, don't buy this game.   If you're playing for a decent variety of guns that actually requre a moderate amount of skill to shoot (unlike the use of weapons in nearly any RPG) then this may be a fun sandbox game to run around in. Just avoid the clumsy story that pours and sets like old spilled soda on the New Vegas world.   I for one, am here for both and am on the fence about this game and because of that I won't reccomend it. Just get something else that is less buggy, with faster character movement, and actually pays attention to you during the climax of the game.  I'm disappointed, I will have to reload my save and redo the entire level (the hardest level.. oh and did I mention this is a Sandbox?). Oh well, it's time to grind. Ah yes I almost forgot, the industrial grinder, and other mele weapons of its type are more powerful than a shotgun to his face. Oh, but not your face.

The main quest offers good freedom of choice, but otherwise quests are mostly quantity over quality – a hallmark of Bethesda. Some of the characters were entertaining though, and voice acting is fairly good. Character leveling and perks are also quite well done. The interface looks cool but is a total pain to use. There are no keyboard hotkeys, which means switching weapons or healing requires browsing through the full menu each time! Combat feels unbalanced (Oblivion and Skyrim were slightly better here) ranging from ok to frustratingly tedious or difficult. The difficulty of various foes often does not match with the expectations the game lore may give you. Enemies run around without any movement inertia making them frustratingly difficult to aim at. Hitbox detection is not great, and your bullets are often blocked by invisible walls if they pass near geometry. I also had lots of enemies get stuck behind geometry, with only legs clipping through the wall. Worst of all, at one point, my gun would not fire bullets – I would hear and see the gun fire, and the ammo counter would work, but no bullets – I got eaten alive, both ingame and in terms of frustration. The mod experience was bad: I could not get most mods to work despite following all instructions etc. The mod scene may be vibrant, but it is still a total mess. It lacks curatorial refinement and there are no “1-click install” total-overhaul supermods (like the “complete” mod series for the Stalker games).

Pros+ modable guns semi-intersting charecters post-apocolyptic wastland (if you're into that) companions mutiple factions you can side with easily modable with mods off the nexus  Cons- The crashes. SO many crashes. Not crash to desktop crashes but (at least in my experience) crashes that require you to resart your computer. You'll get one or two quests done and it'll crash. Keep in mind I have the mod New Vegas Anti-crash (NVAC if you want to get it off the Nexus) and it does this, its probably even worse without it.  Conclusion Overall its a great game but its plauged by technical errors. If you can get past these its a great game.",

My point is that you have to chose wich side you want to take, the thing is when none of the side is appealing well, you have no reason to fight for !  And that's a big issue in such a long game based around the story ( it's a RPG ! )... If you are not commited in the story well, you will just get bored really easily !",

            "review_text": "noticed how now a days, when people review a game, they tend to bash a game when the game doesnt meet their expectations or because the game is not want they wanted it to be. Like saying that its a good and really fun game, yet is not a good fallout, like it was done with fallout 4, which is kinda crazy. Look if a game is good, is good, and worth recomending, regardless of it being a great representation of what a fallout game or a whatever title game it should be. Because the biggest thing that should influence on whether you recommend a game, is whether a game was fun or not.  Now, i've put back reviewing this game as a i have mixed feelings about what i wanted from new Vegas and what got.  On the plus side:  1.Lots of guns, in fact more than ever before and after. 2. added ironsight which is a big plus specially when your out of vats points or sp, and you need to fight in real time. 3. adding more to the fray, by putting a traits system. 4. it kept the same depth from fallout 3, whn it came to lelveling up, while adding more goofy(yet a bit useless) perks. 5. introduction to hard core was a nice touch. Was it annoying at times? ♥♥♥♥ yes, but it was still nice. 6. added a bit of more costumization, by adding mods for weapons. 7. more armor variants. 8. companion system got expanded. 9. the oportunity of tailoring you route to the end game. 10. All of the dlcs, except honest hearts.  Cons and what killed the game for me sometimes:  1. The game had a definitve end, which means i had to make an additonal save before the end mission , just so i could continue exploring, after i finish with the slides. 2. there being a endind followed by slides, kinda eleiminated the posiblity oif seeing the aftereffects of your actions at first hand. Sorry but prefer seeing the what i did rather then looking at some slides that remind me of my dickish actions.(i dont need a reminder of everytime i was an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) 3. The setting: I did not like the desert, because at times it felt dead, really really dead. more dead than the precalc math class at my college.  4. the atmosphere changed from one type of pepresive ot another type. in fallout 3 everything felt ♥♥♥♥ed, just by walking all i could feel was how depressing a ♥♥♥♥ed up world could look. Then i played NV, when all i felt as a walked in game was, how depressive being alone in a desert could be.  5. Too many guns, yet nothing to use them on. The game feels pacific, adn you can litereary play 90% without having to fight, and do to the fact that a lot of times one was outgunned, i just went for the lets talk rode. So i never felt forced to fight. which drove me to eventually force fights, and eventually massacring BOS, the Legion, the boomers, and the great khans( and cold bloodedly murdered mr house :) ). i did not kill the ncr people since i liked going to town without getting shot. point is unles you force a fight the game feels too pacific, which can be boring at times.   There should be a balance between conflict, and diplomacy.  6. Some of the dlcs felt unfinsished. specially homest heart, which at the end just gives you a box with all of the chracter's props. that felt cheap.  7. i stoped liking the story after killing benny, since there was no reason for me to help neither of the factions, and i felt like an outsider trying to fix other people's problem. specially when one goes from being the mail man looking for answers, to being the chosen one that forges the future of New Vegas.  8. The New Vegas Strip was disapointing, and boring. though i loved working for the omertas, and doing the hitman like quest. But yeah the strip felt more boring the reaching diamond city and realizing that it was all that amazing. :/  9. the reputation system felt broken. look if i kill a NCR patrol, way out in the desert and leave no witnesses to report my actions, then there is no way my reputatio should drop. The reputation system made some armor sets truoblesome.  10. they kept the awfull karma system.  11. the map layout is garbage.   Now my biggest problem is that they went for the 18 months for NV, instead of asking for more. and yes they could have told bethesda that it was not ready yet, and pull the release date back, but they didnt.An noew people blame bethesda because obsidian did not have enough time. Even when they they built NV on already strong fundation with already built meshes, and designs, when all they had to do was insert, lay over the loations with the preexisting meshes and put the story, place npc and so on. They used the already desings npc archetypes, created a few armors, reused ton of old ones, and made some horrible looking counterparts. the waepon animations where from fallout 3 and so on, which is why it was so easy combining both games and pushing for the modd of Tales of to Wastelands.    To me it was a fun, it was a diferent fallout. it felt new in somethings. it let me role play as a cowboy. The DEAd money DLC was genious. And it gave me the fallout fix i needed, since fallout 3 was on 2008 and i had already played the game for 2.5 years. so i needed something new, though for me these game felt old after a year. Thankfully there is the Modding community..... Thank you for your dedication. You guys are the reason i rebought this game for pc.   But other than that this game is not as good as fallout 3, and even buggier.  Might as well play fallout 4, which makes up for all of the bad in these game.  6/10",

It's what you'd expect from a Fallout game, good characters, intresting critters trying to kill you at every step, factions that need you. The addition of different types of ammo and hardcore mode are teriffic.  The only reason I can't recommend the game... I haven't beaten it. The game is so incredibly buggy that as you continue to play, you will eventually find yourself unable to open certain doors or unable to complete certain quests. Even after modding the game to provide some stability, I haven't been able to get to the end of the main quest.  It's not a bad game, but if you want to finish it... you might be as completely frustrated as I have been.",
