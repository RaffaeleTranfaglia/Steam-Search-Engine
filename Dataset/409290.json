When I wrote this review, I had like... 12 minutes on record? Not too sure. The music (some of it) is relaxin' and fits the mood. Not sure if there's a way to keep it at one song?   Although the game is really cute and awesome and has a 'bark bark' button, I do have some complaints.  My complaints are: - The doggo stops every now and then when you're movin' around. No bueno. Fix that. - The intro to the game. Call it a nitpick if you will, but those smilies in the beginning are atrocious and have no business of being there. I believe simple grunts would work fine. And why does the dude just lay on the ground in front of the door? C'mon. - The hud seems kinda... I dunno. Generic? Livin it up a bit.   I guess that's about it. The last too don't necessarilly bug me THAT much, but those are my complaints. Definetely look into fixing the movement though. Please.  bork bork",

            "review_text": "Edited Review: Since the developer fixed the ability to run with a controller I find this game much more enjoyable  Original:  Any game that involves a dog usually gets my attention. Herding Dog is a colorful game with a cute block-like style. However, the downfall of this game is the controls. I play using an Xbox One controller and the controls are far from responsive. I could not find a button for run which makes it hard to play on the fourth level. The fox/wolf is too fast to keep up with and it got frustrating. Despite that it is a cheap, time killer.   I would not recommend this game as of current but if the controls were fixed I would highly recommend this game.",
