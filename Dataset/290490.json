            "review_text": "3/10  The Flock is a game in which you fight in the skins of monsters together with 4 other players over a lightbeamgun. If you dont have the lightbeamgun, you hunt the lightbeamgun carrier together with the rest. If you do have the lightbeamgun, you have to activate certain portalstones with them to earn points, and you can kill the monsters with the lightbeam, as long as they arent turned to stone by standing still. In order to keep the lightbeamgun lightbeaming, you have to keep moving.   It's a great concept, yet a little repetative.. On top of that, this game is far from finished. I've played many Alpha en Beta games, and they were more complete than this game. I honestly dont understand why it was released already.   In the first menu I encountered after opening the game, half of the letters were missing. The second menu, there's some options like  (NO STRING ATTACHED) YES and (NO STRING ATTACHED) NO  Then, after joining a lobby, and the game telling me the match will start in 60 seconds, I wait 60 seconds.  And another 60 seconds. I wait a total of 600 seconds. Still nothing happens..  In its current state, don't buy the game. I will check in a few months to see if the game got improved by updates and if so, i will update my review.",

            "review_text": "Fun game. The concept is simple and yet somewhat new. It is fun for a little while, honestly. Unfortunately, the game in its entirety (so far) can be described as 'simple'. You don't quite get what you pay for, in regards to content.  Sure, for $17 you can get 2 copies of it! But honestly, at this point in the games history, the game is not actually worth $8.50/copy. I would place it at a $5 maximum value.  There are TONS of bugs that you will encounter when you play. I get text errors and misplaced objects before I even get past the start menu. The character and level designs are kind of goofy looking, making me wonder how much time has been put in this game. On top of all that, the game tries and fails to bring any good quality fear-inducing features. Maybe that will be something they fix in phase two, buuuut the only way to play in phase 2 is to play in phase 2.  It's like a club that you have to pay an admission fee to and then after you swear in, they no longer allow new members in to the club. It's an intriguing idea and I am personally interested enough to see what they have in store for the next phase of the game.  However, I would not recommend buying into this game if you haven't already. I wouldn't exactly say it's worth the money you would be paying for.",

            "review_text": "This game had potential but there are may bugs and flaws. First off I like the idea of the game and the game itself is fun. There are only 3 maps and only 2 of them are good. Some graphics options cannot be turned on such as fullscreen and antialiasing, whenever I click apply they reset. The light system is broken af. Flock can move through the light even when it is shined at them. I thought this game was good but I will give it a negative review until the game becomes less flawed.  Edit: The games first update fixes some problems such as the string not found error, increased the score to a 120 from 100 and decreased points gained from the light carrier from 40 to 30. The game is a litle bit more balanced now.",

            "review_text": "In the time I have in this, I have honestly seen almost all maps and mastered being the hunter thing and the guy with the lantern.. I have also noticed that the counter has stopped on their site and in game there are less and less players..... hope they will add something more innovative in the future.  As of now I have to call this game a ripoff and I am truelly dissappointed. It seemed interesting but it is exact the same over and over again. Just a different environment so now and then.   If this game gets below 2 bucks it MIGHT be worth buying it then, but as of now I don't recommend it, at least not for this price.   Also after the life counter hits zero the game will be unavailable and a new thing will happen or so.. but at this rate, I don't think it will ever lose more than 1% of the total lives remaining.  If the devs ever read this, it can be good this game, perhaps with different game modes, or more type of enemies. Maybe give the guy with the lantern some tool that makes him either more agile or aggresive towards the enemy, but balance it out. Maybe a type of enemy that is fast but has low health against light and one that is slow but high health against light or something like that, think out of the box. This is kinda like Evolve, but just the core concept (that is as of now, might change later and I will adjust my review properly if that happens).",

I liked the idea of this game, unfortunately they got my money for a product I can not even play. From what I have seen the only selling point that drove this was the limited lives and promise of some kind of awesome event when they ran out. Aside from that claim there are no legs for this game to stand on in my eyes.",

            "review_text": "This is created by students from the high arts acedemy here in The Netherlands. i've spoken with some of the guys in person a year ago that are making this game. they will try everything to fix those nasty bugs. keep in mind that this is their first game every gamedeveloper team (or person) needs to start from the bottom.  'About poeple yelling: this game is buggy controls are clunky game is not highly polished ' i have seen poeple make worse games. this game is just fine in my opinion. the controls may be a bit clunky or the graphics not super pollished, but hey this is their first project and the concept is fun and that is what counts. not everything is a AAA title, and even some AAA games can be worse(for example: aliens colonial marines).   'About the concept of the game going into finale mode after the population count has reached 0': I think it is a brilliant idea because game servers don't last forever. communities eventualy die and servers need to be payed for. (for example when i try to play titanfall i can't seem to start a decent game because there are no people). just keep in mind this is created by students as a project for their academy and as most of us know(if you ae smart enough to figure out) most students don't have money at all to sustain their living on their own so they need a income.  Some people are just stupid enough to buy everything that is hyped. for gods sake do some research and watch/read some reviews so you know what you are up to.  'About poeple just yelling stupid things like you should have beta test this blablabla': This game was beta tested several times in closed alpa and beta. you know when those tests happened this game was hyped to the max. everyone wanted to play this. but even beta servers needs to be payed for. so a closed beta was a good idea in my opinion. else they wouldn't simply have enough server capacity.   but those bugs are going to be fixed. even AAA games have bugs when they come out of a beta test. but they work with like 100+ staff members to fix those compared to most indie developers.  In my opinion people need to respect the developers more everyone starts from the bottom. The concept of this game is awesome. Respect for the devs and good job.",

Matchmaking and other game crashes on Day 1 are to be expected. I am going to ride this one out because I think the game is only going to get better and the finale once the population reaches zero has me a bit curious. I think the price of the game is fine and it will pay for itself in the long run because there is still a part of the game that nobody even knows about. The game has competitive potential once people get the hang of it. I would like to see additional maps, weapons and creatures in the future.",
