From what I played it is simplistic and lacks any form of ineresting ways to form out your defence, visual feedback is fairly poor as the towers from what I can tell doesn't change visually when you upgrade them, nor does the attacks evolve in any interesting way only increased damage numbers. even though the price is low I would not recommend it, there are other games around the same pricepoint or free that are more engaging.",
