            "review_text": "It's a great game, if it didn't crash most of the time. No way to change your controls too.  It has a steep learning curve and when I mean steep, I mean STEEP. There are a lot of button that you have to click before you do this or do that, it's very complex and not for those who are just out to spawn in a bunch of ships and planes on a map and make a battle so huge, that your PC would explode for the sheer amount of ♥♥♥♥ going on.  An otherwise great game ruined by game-breaking bugs and crashes. And did I mention you couldn't change your controls?  Recommend only buying on sale and/or if you're determined to overlook this game's flaws and have patience because it might crash every now and then.",
