At first glance it turned out to be more of a been there, done that type of game. It really doesn't offer anything new or innovative over the original. The one interesting piece was the tie in of a second character and being able to play certain events from the eyes of both. But it did feel a little awkward not playing as Max Payne the whole way.  Like the first game, the AI is overly difficult, even on easy, which kills much of the enjoyment. Precise aim combined with unbelievable reaction times and pre-firing around corners. QuickSave is pretty much your best friend. Overall, I didn't hate it, but I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as the first one either.",

I think the core of this game is just absorbing every element of the story of this psychology thriller, like a simple tour in a heavy gritty mind of a man. That funhouse level is a perfect example that illustrates this, we simple run through this crazy madhouse fictionally inspired by a fictional tvshow inside the game, these elements try to be realistic in a way that they affect the character and complement the complexity of that fictional Noir York City. I come back to this game not because of the shooting or bullet time but because of the nightmarish feel it always leave me, the characters we interact with always seem crazy, strange and distant. The TVshows always feel like a omen of bad things to come or a satire of Max's life. Technically the physics were pretty good for it's time and the game was released with tools from the developer, something rare nowadays, so there are plenty of mods out there even total conversions. Lots of game interaction, sound design, music, everything, everything in this game was polished and worked. Great game should be preserved! culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant!",

Once again you play Max Payne in probably his darkest time in his life. He is trying to deal with his grief of his dead wife and child, he is addicted to pills, and he is falling for a woman named Mona Sax. Life isn't the prettiest at the moment huh? I would go on, but truthfully I believe the less I tell about the story the better.   Everything was made better in this sequel. The graphics are WAY better than the first. So much so that it still holds up pretty well today. The guns feel a lot better. Actually everything feels a lot better. It all feels a little heavier. The level design is even better and there is more variation to the game play. Like protecting a person you're escoting. It's not just all running and gunning. There is less ammo which is better. It keeps it challenging. In fact I would say Max Payne 2 is harder than the first.   The sotry is handled a lot better. The sound design is much better. The voice acting got a little better. The music is amazing. Everything seems to come together so well. I can easily say this game is on my top five shooters of all time.   This is totally worth a buy. Especially in the bundle. Please don't pass this game by. It's something that everyone who plays games should play through once.   *Small spoiler*  Even to this day the last line sits with me. It really flows very well with Max as a character and where everything goes.       'I had a dream of my wife. She was dead. But it was all right.'",

The game continues the bullet-time feature which leads to some awesome gunfights and allows you to land those precise headshots. The story is a good as ever and the story telling remains the same as a graphic novel. If you enjoyed the first game then you will enjoy the second game even more. The length of the story is about the same as the orignal game, around 7-8 hours - I wish the game was longer because it's just too good!",

Many people dislike it due to that but the game is still heavy with action-packed sequences, therefore, I believe there is no need to downgrade this one.  Mona, the girl Max encounters, becomes an essential part of the story and you can control her in a few levels. Max has not changed a lot - bullet time is still important and is very useful to complete the levels.   This game was a milestone in video gaming at that time - I believe it was one of the first games utilising the Havok engine; seeing how the eliminated enemies fall down and hitting objects was jaw dropping in 2004.  I do not know why Valve did not upload more pictures or a couple of gameplay videos. You should check some on YouTube then you can easily make up your mind to pick this one up if it receives a discount. It certainly aged a lot so playing it after the 3rd episode might turn you away, still, I recommend giving it a try.",

Also the game elements are a lot more varied, you meet people in the street, and they will give you a hand in the level. And then there’s the story line, quite possibly the best part of the game, its deep, and it really makes you think. Every element has been well thought out, the only two criticism are the very short game, and the fact that the level design is slightly too linear, there’s only one way through.",

Gunplay is very fun, and the story goes really really deep, but not as 'Illuminati' deep as Max Payne 1. Graphics have aged very well, the soundtrack was good for the most part, and it was QUITE the experience, I can tell you that! A blast to play through, and a solid run for your money. Get it!

One of my favorite, and most important, changes is that Max Payne himself no longer looks like he's smelling a rank fart. He looks like a human. The other characters also look like humans, rather than video game models wearing human faces. The bullet time is infinitely more useful as it replenishes faster and it gets a boost when you kill someone. The dodge-shooting also works better as it will let you keep firing from the ground, and doesn't immediately jump up and break the action until you stop firing.  The story is a lot more cohesive, and more interesting. It's not just a dude killing everyone in his way to get to the person who killed his wife and daughter. There are different motives and they change, and the characters change. The game is short as hell, but so was the first Max Payne, and with less frustration.  Max Payne 2 is a better game than the original and, for all intents and purposes, you shouldn't feel compelled to play through the first Max Payne before you play this one. It is a truly great game.",

The same old comic-style noir cut scenes are still here and as good as ever. The story seemed a little less interesting this time and was more about Max chasing Mona Sax around and shooting up all kinds of baddies in the process. There's a tag team section where Mona covers Max with a sniper rifle while he traverses a construction yard that is probably the pinnacle of the game's ingenuity. The 'All Ghillied Up' mission in Call of Duty 4 gets a lot of praise for this idea but Max Payne 2 really thought of it first even if they didn't execute it quite as stylistically.   Lots of interesting locales though and the way you defeat the final boss was a means of thinking outside the box before it was cool to make games that think outside the box.",

Max Payne 2 has some of the same issues, particuarly noticable in the final chapter, but overall I would say it's a better game. Bullet-time still feels clunky, but it's easier this time to get through the game without it. The story is shorter and packs more punch, even if I didn't like the ending.   The only part of Max Payne 2 that I hated was an escort mission, one of the worst I've ever experienced. Everything else was challenging without being too damning (until enemies start attackign you from rooms you've already cleared in th efinal missions; super ♥♥♥♥ign cheap). I'll still always prefer Enter the Matrix to this, but that's probably just because I don't like noir.",

            "review_text": "Wow. In just 2 years Remedy was able to make a sequel that made the combat even more engaging, have the dream sequences feel even more ominous, have more depth into it's main character and have some great development in-general. The atmosphere of the world is so thick you can shoot bullets through it. This game also acts as a staple of 'past generation game design' with some solutions to problems being left for you to figure it out and some non-linear paths to events of the gameplay just from the player mucking about or listening to NPCs. One moment has Payne going through an apartment complex with a couple civillians that can tag along with you, helping you out in gunfights and even giving you cover when you reach a certain point. Or you can simply shoot them right away, there's no penalty for it. As long as you have a gun in your had at the time you can shoot anyone and everyone you like.  There's simple touches to the gameplay that don't do much other than making Payne look even cooler (slo-mo reloading). Another one of these is TV, yes you can just sit back (stand) and watch some telly. Being honest, I spent 10 minutes watching different things on the TV until it started repeating, damn. One of the things on the TV leads into the great and not very obvious or in your face symbolism. 2 of the recurring shows on the TV give some nice symbolism to the events of the story at the moment that you watch it, or into Payne's own mindset. Sometimes even teasing future events yet to happen. And by the last level you can watch both series finale's. It's this great dream-like state that the game has that I particularly loved and that the games use to great effect. There's some nice cameo's that, if you're paying attention, you'll notice right away as well. A few points give you control of a second character for story purposes, and it's a little weird when you discover that she has the same bullet-time abilities as Payne.  Just like the last one, Max's VA is just brilliant at his lines. While everyone else is either 'eergh', okay or inconsistant with their performance. Unlike the last one the game works like a charm, with absolutely no bugs or technical problems. By the end the game's world feels just as lonely and cold as Payne is feeling from what's happened during the game, the way the story unravels is great and some moment are pretty heavy *-*. Unfortuately it doesn't have the visual scope of the original and a lot of the locations you are in are just the same places you were in the last game. There are a couple great set pieces though that allow opportunities for the level design to be more creative and one being a theme park of sorts for one of the TV shows in the game, which is mainly for the psychological themes to kick in. But that unfortunately get old by the 2nd and 3rd visit there. You should already be playing/ have finished this if you enjoyed the first one, and the ending gives some great mystery to where Max's life is going to head to next. I ONLY wish it was longer.   9/10 :)",

The way the character develops in this series is surely one of the most fascinating aspects of the game, at least for me. Now, storyline aside, the second Max Payne felt a little underwhelming for me because it was much easier than the first one. I have only played on the default mode (which is Detective IIRC) and it still felt much easier to beat than its counterpart. On the same line, it was very very short, a lot shorter than the first one, and even though it was action-packed and very entartaining, it took me only 9.5 hours to beat it. Anyway, when it comes to gameplay, it is a clear improvement compaired to the first MP. The bullet-time is more efficient and feels a lot better - on the downside, it makes things too easy (again), so I've realized I've gone thru 80% of the game without even using it, which says a lot since there are angry thugs wanting to kill you at every corner. But, surely, the gameplay feels more smooth and it has some new cool little things (like being able to carry both handguns and hand-thrown weapons).  So, tl;dr: storyline (+ bonus points for character development) - 8/10; gameplay - 7/10; overall - 7.5/10 'twas fun.",

They do. In fact, they're even better, with me being a more mature gamer and properly appreciating the work of art that is the MP franchise. After being done with MP1, I jumped to MP2, which is also the first MP title I ever played and a such holds a special spot in my gaming heart.  Is it a sequel worthy of the first game? Yes, yes it is. 100%, and then some. Basically, all that was bad in MP1 was fixed in MP2, and all that was good was made better. MP2 features even better comic book style narrations. The script is equally well-written as before. In addition, the game now has proper cutscenes which provide a good transition between some scenes.  Gameplay-wise, the tempo has been balanced a bit. Instead of the relentless onslaught, there are sections in MP2 which are exploratory only. The infamous dream-like sequences have been remodeled and made far less frustrating. Bullet time has undergone a few subtle changes, all for the better. There are some graphical improvements and fancy animations, of course, but the most important one is in the gameplay mechanic.   Remember how in MP1 you would shoot-dodge (that is, dive in bullet time) and if you weren't able to clear the room of enemies in that one slow-mo leap, you'd be forced to watch an animation of Max standing up, during which he'd be powerless - and most likely dead, considering MP1's punishing difficulty. Now, after shoot-dodging, Max can remain down, firing his guns from a prone position. This makes a world of difference.  The game's difficulty has also been adjusted. That is not to say the game is easy. You'll still die, but nowhere nearly as often as before. Quick save is still present, but it won't be your #1 button anymore. I admit the adjusted difficulty made for a more enjoyable and fluid experience. And for those wanting an extra challenge, there are tougher difficulties to choose from once you beat the game - including unlocking and alternate ending for beating the game on the highest difficulty.  And lastly, visually, for a game 11 years old, MP2 is stunning, and only the most shallow gamers would condemn it for 'looking bad'.  MP2 is a must-play game for anyone who deems himself a lover of 3rd person shooters - or simply great games in general.",

I can only say one thing, that this game is sure to blow your mind away. Buy the bundle if you are looking for the full effect.  ",

I'm very passionate about this game cause it's a true piece of art. Yes I said it, like its precursor it's very noticable that the developing team has had tons of fun and heart while making these games (unlike part 3 which rockstar F***'ed in my opinion).  The fact alone that they tried to figure out the right style for the game, to make it all come together. The comics that tell you parts of the story in between, the great voice actors (GREAT!!.. VOICE!!.. ACTORS!!), the music, the long story which even ingame has carefully selected cinematic cutscenes.. For the love of God if you never played this just buy the freakin' game already, even if it's not on sale!  Besides all this Max Payne 2 was an innovating game bringing slow-motion bullettime to your pc, and it's a gem that can hold its name proudly between other timeless games. Now if you'd excuse me, I got a Max Payne mural to make in my bedroom (no it's not Max in sexy underwear).  Oh, and make sure you watch the tv series in the game. There are many worlds inside this world.   9/10",

He's much more of a sad dramatic man that complains all the time about his past actions. At first the game may seem like a dissapointment, but really the farther you get the better it becomes. You see why he acts like he does and the story really folds it's self with lots of homages to the first game. All in all it was a great game and I would give it a solid 8/10 Just remember the begining is the only part that can put you off and stop you from playing, but ignore it and keep playing like I have now, and you will love it.",

The characters are back, and the story continues. The spookyness of the first game kinda disappeared, and i find the first part a bit better, but some elements in this game have definitely improved, bullet time especially shines in this part. Vladimir Lem was as a character very well developed, and i'd want to give this game a 9.7.",
