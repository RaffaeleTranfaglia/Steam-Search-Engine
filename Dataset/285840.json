            "review_text": "Definitely an interesting game. I've always been a fan of shmups and the unique mechanic of taking over enemy ships was what sold me on it initially.  The controls are a mixed bag. If you're more accustomed to 16-bit era shoot-'em-up games, you should be fairly comfortable with them. It's about on par with Super R-Type or Gradius III. If you're used to more modern shmups, however, it may be a problem.  The game itself is fairly short, which is to be expected in this genre. There are 8 levels in all, each with multiple waves of enemies. Each level ends with a boss fight. Some involve fighting a large formation of standard enemies, others involve fighting larger crafts which utilize the ship-swapping ability in different ways. The game can be difficult at times, but considering that you have infinite continues and you continue from the beginning of the last wave you've reached (which is also what happens when you lose a life, oddly enough), it's a little on the easy side. I managed to beat the game in about 3 hours. The replay value for the game stems from the storyline, which varies based on actions you take. So if you don't really care about that kind of thing, it's kind of a wash.  Fortunately, there are also some unlockable extras, like an arcade mode that does away with starting at the beginning of each wave (but eliminates contiunes), a boss rush mode, the original proof-of-concept game and two parodies of other games.  Gamepad support is great. I had absolutely no problems with my 360 pad. Best of all, there's even an option to switch between both analog sticks and the D-Pad to control both the ship in-game and the menu controls.  In summary, if you're looking for an old-school horizontal shooter with some unique mechanics, I'd definitely suggest picking this up. On the other hand, if you're looking for a bullet-hell shmup, this game probably won't offer much.",

            "review_text": "This game will eat your hands.   It can be that challenging in spots, but unlike the classic shoot'em up arcade games, if you learn to master it, you can recover from near death over and over by jacking ships. Or, in some cases, asteroids. While my initial playthrough is short (4.1 hours), there's enough here to make me want to try it again, both mastering the stranger ships' playstyles as well as figuring out the story.   With all that available to keep the game interesting, it should be mentioned the art style, animations, and soundtrack are all wonderful in themselves. The alien ships tend to have animations that make them immediately recognizable (if the looks weren't enough, that is) from the human ships, making them even more of a joy to jack, but that doesn't mean the human ships don't also have some creative and fun designs and animations to go with them. They very much do, which makes it a tough choice at times to decide between which faction to try to carry through the game with.   This is only compounded by the differing story perspectives they also each offer, as you get to see each side's perspective in this game in more depth than you ever would in past arcadey games like this. It's a little disorienting at first, but starts to come together towards the end, however I suspect replaying it and trying harder to stick with one side's story might illuminate foggier areas of the story, which makes the length great where it's at. Any longer, and it might feel too tedious to explore the other perspectives in-depth, but as it is? It's great, and I'd definitely recommend it, it's far more than you might expect from a $10 game!",

            "review_text": "Very cool little game, I quite enjoyed it. I play a lot of shmups so it's getting more and more difficult to find one that really feels different, but this one with its awesome mind-taking-overing power really surprised and impressed me.  I thought it might be just a kinda gimmicky addition to a standard sidescolling shooter, but I was wrong.   You have the ability to take over the minds of enemy pilots, and that's your only ability. Once you do that you can fly their ship and use its weapon til ammo runs out (tightly limiting ammo forces you to always be on the lookout for a new ship, you can't find a favourite and just blast everything), or you get blown up.  If you jump out of your pilot's mind just before your death blow, you can get in a new mind and keep going if you've aimed/timed the jump properly. It's safer to get a new mind before that point though. Each ship has a different amount of armour, with the lightest crafts taking two hits to be destroyed, so you always have a low armour warning before you explode. Each ship has its own unique weapon or playstyle or both, and trying them all was a lot of fun. Also the game is really built around the concept, so some levels and boss fights are really unique to this game and its mechanics. I was very happy with this. Happy is good. I just finished the main story mode, and soon will have another go to re-read all the story bits now that I understand what's going on. The story is told in snippets of memories from the pilots you inhabit, and you piece things together as you go. I like that approach, and I think the story is actually pretty cool, but it may take some players more than once to get it.  There's also an extras menu that unlocks (I think? That or it's empty at first) after some progression, and as you get further through the game more things are added to it. There's alternate modes, a couple of mini-games, and more. I don't want to spoil the surprise, so I'll just say that one unlock is pretty much the most realistic simulation I've ever played.  So there you go, my first review. I hope it's helpful to somebody.",

            "review_text": "Enemy Mind is a difficult 2D side-scrolling shoot-emâ€™-up (schmup). It isnâ€™t tremendously long â€“ it has 80 stages, including 8 bosses, taking about 4 hours to complete â€“ but it is definitely quite taxing. Unlike many modern games, this game incorporates a lives system and score system, meaning that if you die, you have to start a set of ten stages over again. This can be very unpleasant if you get a game over on a boss.  The central conceit of Enemy Mind is that you are a mind-hopping parasite who can jump from ship to ship. Each ship has limited ammunition and can take 2-5 shots before going down. Your goal is to use the ships to hop through the battles, taking down all the enemy ships while avoiding being in a ship when it goes down yourself. This leads to fairly unique gameplay, as the ships have a wide variety of attack patterns, both in your hands and in the hands of the AI. This is especially notable in the boss fights, where you must hop around between various ships during the fight to take down the boss without the boss destroying you in the process. Indeed, almost all of the bosses can themselves be mind controlled, resulting in interesting gameplay as you work to destroy the boss while hopping in and out of its body.  The game has a story underlying it â€“ in-between stages, you can listen to enemy chatter over the coms system, as well as having various memories filter into your mind. While delivered via text, the story is interesting as it reveals more about both the mind-hopping parasite and the world youâ€™re inhabiting, and depending on whether youâ€™re controlling a human ship or an Aratus (alien) ship, you get different story messages (and, at the end of the game, a different ending based on which faction you spent more time mind controlling over the course of the game).  Overall, this is a pretty creative game, and is definitely a distinctive entry within the schmup genre. While the game isnâ€™t mind blowing in terms of quality, it works quite well, and it is fun navigating your way through the game and working out what is going on. That said, it is a schmup game, so if that sort of thing isnâ€™t your cup of tea, or if pixel graphics bother you, this isnâ€™t going to change your mind.  Still, if youâ€™re a fan of the genre, this is worth checking out, even if it is quite difficult; judging by the achievements board and high scores, less than 50 people have beaten this game in its entirety.",

The design and the retro-style graphics look great, especially if you are into classic shmups. The chiptune soundtrack is catchy.   The 'Enemy Mind' main campaign is quite short and can easily be finished in under 2 hours (it has some additional modes though that provide more to do). Between the levels there are 'cut scenes' (text blocks) that tell a story that I personally really didn't care for. The enemy ships look cool and there are many different types to fight and take over.   On the down side there are no power ups or shield upgrades at all and every ship only has a limited amount of ammunition and shield power. This forces the player to use the game's unique mechanic of taking over other ships.   There are also some puzzle stages that require you to switch vessels very strategically. Boss fights are very fun and challenging. Generally the difficulty level is low, so this is nothing for hardcore bullet hell players.   I really enjoyed the game and can recommend it. Though due to the very easy difficulty and short play time I wouldn't pay more than 5â‚¬ for it.",

If you possess another ship before you are out of ammo - the old 'You' start shooting you from point blank.  If you jump from fast to slow ship in straight line - you'll get the collision damage with your old one and you'll be one hit from death.  If your old slow ship runs out after you cleaned all but the fastest ships - you'll gonna have bad time getting them.   It takes precision, calculation and holding fire to master it, as shooting all the time will render you naked to the incoming wave. So you kinda need to clear all but the ship you want, spending all the ammo you have and posses it without killing it first.   Yeah, all that on top of the very classic 'shootings everywhere' game.

That said, I expect the vast majority of games I find in giveaways to be minor amusements at best, not even worth the time to download at worst.  This though? Definitely would have been worth paying 10$ for.  First couple of levels I was thinking 'Oh, this is a fun little take on Gradius style space shooters, but not overly complex or challenging'. Then I got to level 3 and suddenly the game made me take back that statement. The ship switching mechanic becomes very important for navigating each level, knowing when to switch and to which target is what keeps you alive. Each ship is easy to learn to control and vastly diffrent from the others in both how they move and fire, and I've yet to find one I didn't have a use for at one point. Though several I found myself jumping to briefly, taking out targets from their angle, then jumping again before I got stuck.  Graphics are sprite based and feel like something out of the SNES era, sound is on a simlar style and quality. Maybe not the best digital synthysizer music I've heard but very effective for the setting. The story I'm still getting into but it's revealed to you in short bits between waves and levels. Minor hints here in there as to why you're a conciousness jumping from ship to ship, and why there's a war between humans and an alien race going on around you. The pacing of the story is just enough to get you hooked and never slows down the action.  The game also has amusing extras that unlock at each level. The first one for example is 'Flappity Mind' which allows you to play effectively a version of Flappy Bird. The others seem similarly ridiculous, but worth it for a few laughs.  So yes. Get this game, Even at full price. You'll have fun blowing stuff up and being the mysterious force making everyone afraid of who's going to turn on them next.",

Segments where you have to swap with debris to get through a debris field are generally dull, and quickly become frustrating when said debris veers offscreen unexpectedly. This is further compounded by the fact that your swap-shot disappears at the edge of the screen, so it is possible to be lining up for a shot and find that your shot disappears upon firing. This is also aggravating when you are expecting it to come back, but it gets too close to the edge of the screen and vanishes.  So good idea, but I can't really recommend it to anyone.

There are a few levels where you have to jump between space rocks, in a puzzle style, VERY trial and error based, as-boring-as-47-straight-hours-of-church bundle of rage-causing monotony. As a huge fan of old games, it's 80's style last ditch effort at making the game seem more challenging, longer, more interesting and a bit more unique.

            "review_text": "While this game is designed to be retro in terms of gameplay, it went too far and make the controls and saving system also retro.... this game is only enjoyable with 2 players because otherwise you restart when you die and it becomes too hard. I played this with my girlfriend and got to the very last wave before the final boss and unfourtunately that wave terminates with a ridiculously difficult series of homing missile launchers appearing on and off the screen and making it almost impossible to beat. A very cheap way to create the most difficult level in the game and ultimately dissapointing. I feel guilty for giving this a negative review, especially since I personally asked the devs to put this game on sale, but such is as it is.  To the devs, retro gameplay is ok, retro everything is not. Remember, mame32 is for free.",
