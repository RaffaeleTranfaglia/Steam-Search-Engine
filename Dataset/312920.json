            "review_text": "Worth the money. The PC version of this game feels so much better for some reason. The graphics look crisp and nice and the game takes a bit to learn but once you get the hang of it you will have a lot of fun. There are a lot of game modes and the Be a Pro Career / Coach Career modes will keep you going for a long time. One of the things that I love about Big Ant is that they continuously support their game with patches. Don Bradman Cricket 14 still gets updates more than a year after its release and fixed many issues and added wonderful gameplay. So if there are bugs in Rugby League Live 3 they WILL be fixed by Big Ant. On the whole the miniscule issues do not detract from the gameplay and fun experience.",

Over all feel and look of ground's is Magic all i need now is up up cronulla yelling in background would be sick!!! The ground's themself's the pitch condition is somethink special THE GRASS looks so sick.  -Menus are easy simple look good. -Gameplay if you have played RLL1 &amp; RLL2 clear your brain of them this is LIGHT YEARS AHEAD -Forward's do there job and sometimes they don't,But they are important it's a team game. -Online don't know yet havent tryed but will update when i do it's beer day today so will update.  -Remember this is no EA/FIFA/PES.But in this Game you can feel the love in every detail which makes this stand out. - Be a pro - WOW just WOW this mode so rule's and the perk system is just amazing i tend to use it in last couple match's before final's so that the Sharkie's win final's. You can create your player edit him at anytime hair/bread/Tattoo's etc which is cool not locked behind same oops made a mistake cannot change or have to start a new career. No 1 tip in be a pro But you fitness up because you could play 2 game's maybe one and get knocked out for rest of season lol. - Fanhub has great community updates on player's,Ref's,Team's. - If you have played Rugby or League and understand running line's looking for gap's this give you the control to be Stacey Jone's it's epic  I remember watching gameplay on ps4 and was like mm it's alright but after buying it and playing myself WOW just WOW. Cannot more than Recommend this game this blew ARL 96 of my top list :D 10/10  Also would like to Thank the PS4 and Xbox One players for testing everythink out for us so us the Master race could have a great game at Launch  Thank you to Ross 'The Boss' and his team at BigAnt for putting up with us and beeing pretty freakn awsome Dev listening to input and output. Cannot be more happier with this :D   Quick update if your wanting to go Online and play had great weekend playing BUT!!! My biggest concern is the Ai and the passing forward and reset's or running away into sideline when you clearly have the stick facing the other way then the ball gets passed willy nilly.  Top Tip No1 for Online Go the Warrior's look at the guy at the top of Leader Boards. Shaun Johnson off kick off 100% he'll score. It's like Shaun Johnson is Jonah Lomu fend's everyone even the biggest forward's  Don't Rage quit make you look dumb keep playing learn from losses took me about Million game's it felt like to get me on my feet then Win's started coming.  Over all Online is alright easy Spam try's Gaps the AI leave are soo bad or they walk off to the pub let other team score.Or even better chuck the ball when you havent even pressed the pass button.  Gotta say this Online mode tested my rage and glad i'm not going to be playing any of it any more.  Game is a 10/10 but online 1/10",

It is fairly evident that the devs are lacking a big budget, although they have done a fairly solid job with this game. It doesn't come without it's flaws but if you are a Rugby fan and a gaming fan it is probably a good idea to pick this up. Don't come into this expecting the next FIFA but this is definitely the most authentic Rugby game on the market.",

This game isnt even up for torrenting why is their an online only DRM, the previous games haven't implimented it and never needed it. This is game breaking, what is really sad is when the game works it is a massive step up from its previous counterpart. The graphics are great, the gameplay is acceptable and I haven't seen replay functions this good in sports games since 2006 Rugby Union. Sadly, the DRM dosen't function correctly and tends to only work when it pleases. Good game game, when it works.",

It's either never worked or i'm not doing it correctly. Who knows? that's why most games have tutorials to make sure the player understands what to do and then successfully executes the function to move to the next stage of the tutorial.   ",
