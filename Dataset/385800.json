            "review_text": "It's Nekopara, you should play it regardless of the cost, as a visual novel while it is mostly slice of life, it also has excellent writing which will keep you involved, this is a prequel and it's also 1/3rd of the cost of Volume 1 which is why it is as short as it is (I finished in 1.2 hours) and Volume 1 took me about 3 days on and off to finish, that includes reading all the nudity parts in the R18+ version.  All of your favorite catgirls make an appearance in this novel and are more prominent now than they were in the last one, this is less focused on Chocola and Vanilla and more focused on all of the cats and Shigure, it's a really adorable novel despite its shortness and also gives you a bit of insight into what life was like before Volume 1 and is also really a good hype builder for Volume 2 which comes out in December. The soundtrack in this novel includes quite a few songs from the soundtrack of Volume 1, which is comforting and also familiar, instead of trying to reinvent the wheel they simply renovated it and brought in a few changes to the OST, while also keeping true to the style.  Pros: You can pet your cats. You can make your cats boobs bounce. Great writing that will keep you involved. Familiar and comforting soundtrack. Many of the CGs include all of the cats, and it's in true Sayori style.  Neutral: Short length, which is really helpful for staying involved but it can also be a bit of a shame that it ends so quickly.  Cons: I can't really think of any major cons, actually, maybe it's just because I've known of Chocola and Vanilla since 2010 so anything involving them is something I absolutely adore.",

            "review_text": "Nekopara Vol. 0 is the presequel to the events that occur in Nekopara Vol. 1.  Story The story is pretty much outlined in the description on the steam store. 'The eldest daughter of the Minaduki household and their 6 catgirls go to wake up their master; prepare breakfast; clean up the house; go out on a walk; make dinner; take a bath; sleep together; et cetera, et cetera. ' Sadly it outlines the majority of what this visual novel has to offer, which can be a bit of a spoiler, but the interactions and personality of the catgirls does offer some light comedy. Their differing personalities, as well as their curuiosity, does lead to them to sometimes being more troublesome than helpful. This being said, the visual novel is a bit short, and can be fully read in about 30 to 50 minutes, depending on your reading speed.  Notable features -As you all may have noticed, there is a hand on the top right of the screen while playing the game, pressing it engages in a petting 'minigame'. This minigame pauses the game's dialogue, allowing you to pet the characters on screen. This is not limited to the catgirls, you can even pet shigure. The petting feature goes a bit further, making the characters react differently; based on where you choose to pet them. -Trading cards with more cute backgrounds and emoticons. -Artwork is similar to that of its predecessor, having some scenes played out in their adorable chibi form, and many other scenes in their normal form. Art is a bit more lewd, as it has a shower scene with shigure as well as the catgirls.(use your imagination)  Verdict 7/10  At the time of this review, there is a small typo, in which Maple asks Coconut if she is sure she can finish all the food she wanted, but refers to her as cinnamon.

But surprisingly, i found myself a lot more entertained than i thought i would.  The characters aren't exactly -diverse- or -interesting-, but for a comedy that doesn't take itself very seriously, it's not really a big deal. These characters (and this game, in general) were DESIGNED to pander to a certain audience, and that's not neccesarily bad as long as it's done right. And i think this game is a pretty good example of it.  While the 'story' and characters don't stand that well on their own, what really got me hooked for this game is:    The humor and visual gags   The GORGEOUS artstyle   The catchy, cute soundtrack   The general sweet tone to it   You're not gonna play this game for the amazing plot. You're gonna play it because it's fun, cute and entertaining. Nekopara doesn't give you what your brain wants to see, but what your heart wants to see. If you're a fan of visual novels, it's guaranteed to leave you with a warm feeling of joy inside, and a smile on your face.",

I'm curious but I don't think the series is good enough to warrant me continuing...maybe if its cheap enough but I don't really think its good...  I think the story might warrant some interest if the characters were at all interesting...They're really just catgirl fodder which what did you expect?  I should say I haven't played Vol. 1 yet maybe I'd actually give a crap about these characters after that and this'd be a....quaint addition? Its just really bad...(again one of the best animation I've seen though, just wish there was something else about it for me to like)  Edit: Just finished the full game. It got worse as I went along.

            "review_text": "  Nekopara as we all know is a war story of a ww2 unit known as the 'Hellcats'. The Grumman F6F Hellcat was an American carrier-based fighter aircraft designed to replace the earlier F4F Wildcat in United States Navy (USN) service. The Hellcat competed with the faster Vought F4U Corsair for use as a carrier based fighter. The Corsair had significant issues with carrier landings which the Hellcat did not, allowing the Hellcat to become the Navy's dominant fighter in the second part of World War II, a position the Hellcat did not relinquish. The Corsair instead was primarily deployed to great effect in land-based use by the U.S. Marine Corps.  Although the F6F resembled the Wildcat in some ways, it was a new design, powered by a 2,000 hp Pratt &amp; Whitney R-2800, the same powerplant used for both the Corsair and the United States Army Air Force (USAAF) Republic P-47 Thunderbolt fighters. Some military observers tagged the Hellcat as the 'Wildcat's big brother'.  The F6F was best known for its role as a rugged, well-designed carrier fighter which was able, after its combat debut in early 1943, to counter the Mitsubishi A6M Zero and help secure air superiority over the Pacific Theater. Such was the quality of the basic simple, straightforward design, that 12,200 were built in just over two years.  Hellcats were credited with destroying a total of 5,223 enemy aircraft while in service with the U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps and the Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm.This was more than any other Allied naval aircraft. Postwar, the Hellcat was phased out of front line service but remained in service as late as 1954 as a night fighter.  10/10 you read a wiki page.",

Be warned it is very short with no replay ability but at the $2.99 price point is worth it if you enjoy these types of games.  Comes with trading cards that hold some solid value while the game is still new help make it a good purchase as well.   Looking forward to Vol. 2.",

Don't have a girlfriend (your anime body pillow doesn't count) or only have one cause she thinks you're funny and takes pity on you?  Have a weird fetish with 12 year old anime girls?  Boy do I have the game for you!  This is the most boring game I have ever played. I can only imagine fat neckbeard weaboos playing this game and giving it positive ratings. There is no story. They're just anime cat girls that move their mouths and sway side to side so their boobs jiggle. Like there aren't even scenes like in anime. It's like watching someone with a cardboard cutout talking. This game has 0 play value.   It is just a game for creepy losers with weird fetishes to jerk off to. They look like 12 year old girls with boobs. Can you say pedo?   If you think this might be a good game because it has so many positive reviews, then you will be disapointed. I will be returning this boring softcore anime porno. It probably has no bad rating because the other 99% of sane people couldn't bare 5 minutes of this game to even be able to post a review.",

The characters are designed by Sayori who is a Chinese and what she designed has already got a great fame in Japan.  but I have to remind the player that want to buy it or wondering whether it is good or not.... DON'T think that this game give you any epic feeling or serious moment of meditating about life. This is just a CASUAL GALGAME but not some galgames in Japan that make you cry make you sad. Play it as a casual way. well the design of character is really wonderfull as I am the fan(maybe a little) of Sayori since I have read the comics when I was in secondary school.  This is Vol 0 , that means is a story the before the Vol 1 AND the most important thing is that there is a new function this time , you can show tender care (sex care(?)) for those cats you can stroke their head , breast , leg  quite good experience bro plz put your TWO hands on the keyboard :)",
