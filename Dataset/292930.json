It kept me engaged the whole way through, and by chapter five I was just completely immersed it's so well done. The story was engaging and well written, and the puzzles were just the right amount of a challenge. The story kept me guessing right until the very end and its rare to find an older game like this that makes you think so much, I just enjoyed it so much! It's also a whole lot longer than expected, it took me fifteen hours to finish, and from the looks of it it took some people even longer. At first I was annoyed with te length, but by the end I was so glad there was so much game for me to enjoy. I can't wait to play the others! If they're any better than this one then they're well worth being excited for!!  Also a side note, some of the reviews report some bugs but I didn't encounter a single one, so whatever bugs they mention have in fact been patched and the game is fully enjoyable!",

A decapitated head in a bucket gave me nightmares for weeks. 10/10  I actually adore this game and am now on my second playthrough (without my dad). The voice-acting is terrible, but aside from that the game is great. There are some puzzles that make you feel hella smart plus the backgroundart is really pretty. I would recommend keeping half an eye on a walkthrough to not get stuck and wander around aimlessly, just to find the right person to continue the story. I would recommend it for all point &amp; click players that like a bit of mystery and horror (gore).",

I reccomend playing it using a spoiler free guide just to get the story and then move onto BM2.  Pros Gripping mystery story  Great Atmosphere Rewarding Puzzles   Cons Really slow animation  Poor pacing which involves a lot of needless back tracking. Voice acting is bad. ",

Despite being published in 2004, the game is still enjoyable and the 11 years old graphics did not compromise the atmosphere nor the immersion feeling. This is due to the fact that the storyline is pretty solid and the puzzle have the right combination of challenge/feasibility (at least for my perspective). The only negative aspect that I found is that the animation of the characters are a little clumsy, slowing down the dialogs and the passage from one screen to the other. They most probably realised the issue, infact they fixed this problem in the second chapter.  If you like games like Monkey Island, Syberia and The longest journey, you will for sure enjoy this series! ",

            "review_text": "I really enjoyed this game. It has an interesting plot for the most part, a really nice atmosphere, and decent graphics for its time. I thought I had figured out certain answers...I was wrong! The voice acting was quite good, with the exception of the main character. The performance of 'Samuel' sounded like the star actor was sick and the poor stage manager had to go through the play reading his lines! Nevertheless, I was interested enough to play it through. There were some mildly annoying game mechanics: Samuel apparently never learnt to run; sometimes there was a lot of travelling back and forth without the ability to 'zip' to places within a location (although there was fast travel between locations, once you have visited them); and some of the plot points didn't jive for me. I liked it enough however, to look forward to playing the sequels. If you like the genre, and the point &amp; click style, then I would recommend this game. I had no technical issues running it on my Windows 10 computer.",

Voice acting of the rest of the cast feels like sex education videos from 60's you' had to endure in high school.  Graphic representation fluctuates everywhere from great to mediocre. Painfully slow and mostly fugly character animation.   Quality of puzzles is a mixed bag  For it's on sale in a 2-5 range, you might as well get it and play it with a guide for the story alone.  At full price, i'd recommend buying gabriel knight I instead.",

            "review_text": "Black Mirror Rating 6.5/10 Overview: Traditional Point and Click Adventure Game  The Good:   + Although the game starts off slowly it does introduce an element of mystery that begins to unravel the more you play. The story and characters are good and the game slowly begins to suck you in as you become more immersed in the world solving the mystery of your family.   + The locations are varied and despite the games' age the pre rendered backgrounds still look good even at a low resolution     The Average:  Unlike other adventure games you cannot simply pick up any object not nailed down. In this game their needs to be a reason for you to take an object so things need to be completed in a certain order for you to proceed. On the one hand this makes things more realistic...on the other hand it become much easier to miss important information/objects when trying to complete a puzzle.   The Bad:  - 'Pixel Hunting' - The term used when you have to roll your mouse cursor over every little object in the game in the hopes you didn't miss something because the vast majority of the time the reason you can't solve a puzzle is because you didn't see the little object you were suppose to pick up in the very back corner of the dimly lit room. Its infuriating and frustrating and this game has a lot of it.   - Certain puzzles are almost impossible to solve without a walkthrough because the game gives very little if any clues in how to complete them.   - You cannot proceed in the game until you 'trigger' certain events, some of these events make no sense with your current task. I.e. You have to complete one puzzle in one section of the game before you can move on in the story in another section of the game even if both events are completely unrelated to one another.   -Near the end of the game you have to wait for a character to give you information before you can trigger the next events in the story. The problem however is the character sometimes refuses to tell you what you need to hear. Looking online, some people only had to wait a few minutes while others had to wait a few hours...... Nobody seems to know what the trigger is to get him to talk. Very poor design.   - Weak ending   Conclusion  I would love to give this game a positive rating but the more I played the worse the problems started to become to the point where I was more frustrated than having fun. The game does have a lot going for it and if you love the genre you should at least check the game out, just make sure to consult a walkthrough when you get stuck because it may not be your fault that you can't solve any puzzles.

I don’t know if it’s the script or the voice acting that we have to thank for this travesty, but I *do* know this game was probably not supposed to be this funny. Oh, don’t worry – you’ll get to examine every excruciating second of this in detail as you relive these scenes over and over again, courtesy of the game’s lack of autosave and multitude of game-stopping bugs. I suppose the best thing I can say is that at least you’ll have had no investment in the characters or the plot when this happens. At least the writers were looking out for us.

The first impression was so strong that I almost couldn't fight off my urge to punch my screen the moment when I saw how choppy the in-game graphics were.  The horror game itself, however, lives up to its name. There were several audio errors that replace the voice lines with loud, high-pitched tics that played with no sign at all. Scared the crap out of me. I thought it was programmed the first time it happened but after a few more and a fatal game crush I figured if the game were to use that as one of its horror factors it would sure to acuqire a better twist in its so-called horror atmosphere.  The protagonist walks way too slow and refues to comment on an object unless he can get real close and press his face on it. Adds to the fraustrating bits of the classical point-and-click games.  I got it from a bundle given by a friend. No harm done. But if you plan to spend $10 on this game be sure to think twice. It offers on more than a good jump-scare with the sudden audio glitch and the sensation of playing a game from the old times.",

            "review_text": "This is a solid P&amp;C adventure game. It definitely has some rough edges, but the good bits more than make up for it.  The rough edges mainly involve miscalculations (in my opinion) by the designers about what makes a P&amp;C game fun. There are some truly annoying pixel-hunting parts of the game where you are supposed to find incredibly tiny hot-spots to click on, without any clue or evidence on what you're even looking for (I'm looking at you, statue outside of the gate in Chapter 3). There is also a few parts where the game degenerates into 'try every combination' territory, where you don't really have a solid puzzle-solving reason to do something, it's just on the list of things you haven't tried yet.  But, honestly, these are common mistakes for early P&amp;C adventures, so for a game like this to be not worth the time, it has to have something else going wrong. And the rest of this game really does well. It has solid puzzles, great ambient sound, and a very interesting murder-mystery-in-castle-full-of-intrigue plot. The only thing in the production values that didn't impress me was the voice acting. It was a little stilted, especially for the protagonist. But it wasn't too distracting from the interesting setting.",
