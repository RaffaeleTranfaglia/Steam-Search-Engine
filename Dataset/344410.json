            "review_text": "It tries hard to be like Portal by adopting some of the features that made Portal a success, it has the omnipresent baddy talking, boxes and buttons, repetitive environments and weird scribbles on the walls which hint that the final goal may be an elaborate ruse, but it fails. At first it did give me an interesting feeling, like being a rat in a maze, but that did not last very long. The learning curve is okay, but there is no sense of difficulty progressing smoothly - one or two insultingly easy chambers can be followed by an annoyingly punishing trial and error based chamber. Especially in the trail-and-error chambers I found the lack of a quick-load and quick save (or any kind of free saving) quite annoying. This means that if you trap yourself, you have to go to the main menu. Failing also means to start the entire chamber again from the beginning, which can be annoying.   Generally not a game I'd recommend. If you are desperate for a Portal-esque puzzle game, I'd first recommend Quantum Conundrum and then I'd maaaaybe mention Magnetic, but it certainly isn't that good. It wasted a lot of potential.",

            "review_text": "This game is addictive. Bearing more than a passing resemblance to the Portal games, the player is thrown into a 'do these tests or die' scenario. Scrawled warnings on the wall start to appear before long and the game gets far more deadly and the puzzles more twisted. The functioning mechanic of Left button to push, Right button to pull works well, but it can take some practice to avoid being pulled / pushed in the wrong direction and oblivion. Some levels are timed and these can take numerous attempts to complete.  Overall the game is polished, fun and perfect for anyone having portal withdrawal symptoms....",

            "review_text": "I can agree with the others who say that the first puzzles are quite easy if you have played Portal, but as you go on, you can really get a challenge. I think I chose one of the latest endings, and had 2-3 rooms that really got to me and felt so frustrating. My first play-through went on for 7,3 hours.  I feel that the magnetic portion of the game is fun and different. I like how the movable beams and such change direction based on where you stand with the gun. I also like that the magnet almost always affects your own position, but that can also be because I used, as Jeremy Clarkson of Top Gear would say, 'POWER!'. I never changed the setting on the magnet gun to anything lower than full ;)  I liked the creepy feel of the game, and I loved the first music you hear when you start the game. It fits really well.  When I had apparently chosen my ending, I felt a little sad. Yes, the game was hard and frustrating in the end, but I enjoyed it very much. For such a low price it gives a lot back. I will have to take in the fact that I might have to replay some of the hardest rooms, and then I will play the game again. I have to see all 9 endings, you know? ;)",

            "review_text": "Portal meets the movie Cube  This is a first-person puzzle game with horror elements in it. The gameplay somewhat reminds of portal but with a magnetic gun instead that manipulates different objects (and yourself!) Good atmosphere and story.  Magnetic may seem like yet another puzzle-game with an unique gimmick that is supposed to blow your mind.. but it's more: the horror element + story really makes this game a gem worth having.  If all this sounds interesting then I'd recommend the game.",

            "review_text": "This game had lots of potential to be a nice puzzle game but different from Portal, Talos Principle etc.   However it FAILS. The controls seem sloppy and its basically like a 3-d hard platformer trying to time jumps. I spent about 30 minutes in 1 room, just trying to time jumping with negative/positive forces to pull or repell me. Its a cool concept, but if you miss one jump you have to do several over again and with what I see as poor controls its frustrating and not fun. This is more about your timing and luck than thinking out a problem and solving it.   So far 6/10 esp since I paid full price not long ago and now its on sale for a few dollars. I'll change the review if things improve, but right now I have no interest in playing a frustrating jump game.",

            "review_text": "It is a puzzle game that bears some similarity to Portal in that it uses a magnetic gun that can attract or repulse certain objects (pick up blocks and set them on buttons). If you like portal you will probably like this game though I don't think it quite matches Portal. I dislike the save system greatly (save when the game allows it, not when you want to which IMO really sucks). Some of the scripting for the voice acting is over the top. Get it on sale if possible.  EDIT  The rendering of the scenery does not in any way match the games that it would compete with (Talos, Portal etc.) The audio tracks are no where near as memorable either. Speaking of which, since I last played the game, the audio has stopped working. Granted, this might be Win 10 update but I've not had this happen with any other game. Unfortunately I can neither play the game nor return it. Consequently, I am changing my evaluation to  not  recommended.",

I enjoyed finding all nine endings, learning more about the world your thrown into more each time, showing more driving motives behind the characters, this game is not meant to be played once by any means.  The Speedrunner achievement is what helped me to love this game, It felt better each time I could clear a chamber faster.",
