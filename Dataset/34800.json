            "review_text": "If you get it really really cheap it isn't unplayable. It just isn't good, or even interesting in any way. The plot and the writing, as well as the characterization range between bad, absurd, same-old-crap and uninspired. The puzzles are too often arbitrary and generally not very enjoyable, but at least there's no pixel hunting. The linearity of them is also annoying occasionally (do this random arbitrary thing first, if you want the story to continue). The backgrounds are rather good, probably the one redeeming quality of this game; the animations a bit less so but not bad. I didn't mind the music, though I found it forgetable, and the voice acting was the standard (read not good but not offensive) fare one usually expects in point &amp; clicks of this budget. The voice acting glitches occasionally, which didn't bother me since I didn't enjoy it and I could read the subtitles instead. What annoyed me more was that except in dialogs, you can't skip certain voice bits, making them repetitive and annoying during some puzzles. It lasts about/under 3 hours, which I suppose is ok for the asking price.  Personally I just didn't care about it. I have a soft spot for this type of mediocre, 'mindless entertainment' type of point&amp;clicks, and I'm willing to forgive alot of campiness and even glitches in them, but this one, apart from the pretty locations, had nothing to offer as far as I'm concerned. Get it on a sale and don't expect much if you're still interested.",

            "review_text": "You play the role of an Archeologist on a quest to find her missing uncle, but it doesn't start that way. In fact your uncle calls you, announcing that he just found a secret underground Temple, underneath the site he has been working on in Gozo for years. And this cave will support your theories and asks you to come meet him in Gozo now.  When you arrive you discover that your uncle has been missing for 2 days and start looking for him. The police says he stole tablets from his site and vanished with them, but you know your uncle and he would never still historical discoveries, something happened to him.  You start your ingame 3 to 4 day journey (took me 4 hours) in your quest to find out what your uncle found and where he is. The game is not always intuitive, you manage to figure out what you have to do, but some times you just get stuck because of 1 little task that you missed. A little frustrating, I had to use a walktrough for those little tasked that are not primary nor necessary to advance in the story.  Overall very good story line, good game play. I recommended this game.",
