If your looking for a fun little game to pass buy a few hours then i highly recommend this game. I was lucky and scored this game for a measly 29 cents. Thats pocket change! But after playing through the whole game i can say 3 dollars is actually a low price. Roogoo is easly worth 5 dollars. Theres 45 levels in the game and 2 difficulty levels. Normal and casual. I played half the game in normal then it started to get two difficult so i played the rest of the game in casual. The game took me two hours to complete. I thoughly enjoyed it and i would highly recommend Roogoo. Even if it is a bit childish.",

However, whilst at first it seems easy, even the most experianced gamers will not be able to complete the levels on the first try. After the first 10 levels, you WILL begin to struggle with the levels. I do not recommend this game if you like easy games or rage easily. I do recommend this to people who like more challenging games, younger gamers and people who like playing with friends through LAN.  Recommended Game  ~Super",

            "review_text": "This is a really difficult review for me to write. I can't think of any one thing I really didn't like about this game, but I'm left (having finished it) with a desire to have those three or four hours of my life back.  What's good: It's cutesy, nintendoey even. Music is oookay, the plot is ridiculous but as with most other games like this (e.g. Shatter or Arkanoid), it gives a nice framework. Basically, it's tetris's slightly braindead cousin. Difficulty ramp-up is nice.  What's not so good: The 3d aspect makes it darned hard in fast moments to see which shape is in front of another one. You rely on the little ring of lights to tell you where something's going to land. But when there is a fast stream of things, the ring of lights only appears about 0.5s before the shape lands, which isn't enough time to rotate the disc. The game is also pretty shallow... once you played the first three or four levels, you've basically got the gist of the whole thing. When the two-toned shape 'towers' came along, I thought 'aha, here we go, this is where it gets fun', but that only lasts a few levels and then peters out.   So, all in all, it's an innoffensive little game, fun if you just want to waste a bit of time, and oh-so-easy to put down and pick back up again. There's nothing intrisically bad about it. In fact, for a toy puzzler it reminds me a lot of the fun I had with original tetris. It's probably way more fun on consoles and with other players. I'm going to give it the thumbs up for originality and good presentation, but it's come very close to thumbs-down for lack of any depth or genuine puzzle challenge. However, I went in with no illusion that it'd be a modern classic, so thumbs-up! ",

            "review_text": "This game needs a fair review. The cutesy graphics have done this game a great disservice - with folks confusing it for a kids game or an easy game. This is a great casual game, with some qualities that I think set it apart  - The game gets hard, especially if you play as 'Normal' not in the 'Casual' mode. Beating the Par time is really hard - you need to focus well. It reports stats like 'Accuracy' i.e. how many blocks you lost due to misalignment. Combined with timing, it keeps you trying to get everything right - The controls are super simple. Just the arrow keys or a 4 buttons on the controller.  - Great for moments when you don't want to get into a complex game and want something simple, yet challenging and fun. - There is little randomness in failure - its always your fault when you lose a piece. So you never feel cheated.  If they were to remake this with a Zombie theme, this game would do much better. But if you can get past that, gameplay is solid.  ",
