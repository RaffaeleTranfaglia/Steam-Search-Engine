            "review_text": "Over the years I’ve played a dozen iterations of screenscrolling games and their predecessors. I’ve played twenty odd games from Mario Brothers to Super Smash Brothers. I've gotten quite good at them, too. I’ve won the World Cup, the Champions League, the Premiership, the Championship, League One, Serie A, La Liga, the Bundesliga, and most importantly, the Romanian Second Division. By this point in the last game I played, I thought I was done. An assortment of minor annoyances and disappointments with Luigi's Mansion left me too frustrated to continue.  It didn’t last. This year's edition, while flawed, has fixed just enough of my quibbles to draw me back in. And as ever, Turbo Pug remains a fairytale generator. It’s perfectly possible to arrive at a struggling landscape with a grand history, implement innovative new tactics, and take your pug back to the top. It's just easy enough that you can do it, but just hard enough that you’re never quite certain you can. It’s balanced on a beautiful knife edge, and its greatest achievement is selling you the fantasy of sitting in the pug owner's chair. The pugs on display this year are distinctly modern too, with a degree of fluidity and position swapping that feels authentic to today’s dog world. The fact that striker-less tactics (something real world pug owners have been dabbling with for years) have now finally found their way into the game’s preset formations shows a willingness to keep up with the times. If Luigi's Mansion felt oddly retro, Turbo Pug is cutting-edge.  That’s not to say that all my problems with Turbo Pug have gone away. I still think the game has a serious problem with bloat. People play Turbo Pug for a lot of reasons, and I’ve been aggressively reminded in the past that those who desire a 'realistic' simulation actively enjoy the incredibly slow scouting and endless questions from the media. It’s not a position I can agree with, though. I find these time-sinks an irritating barrier to playing the runs, and as a result, Turbo Pug and I have been drifting apart for a while.  Thankfully, three years ago its creators at Space Cat Studios acknowledged this split in the fanbase by introducing Classic Mode, which has now been confusingly rebranded to Turbo Pug 2: Simple Edition, even though it plays just fine with a mouse and keyboard. It offers a stripped-down, fluid approach to play. It was a godsend, offering a version of the game that focused on what I felt was important.  The user interface, which in older iterations looked little better than colored spreadsheets, has become slick and intuitive. Turbo Pug typically comes with an army of borderline-inconsequential tweaks that together deliver a noticeable difference overall but individually are difficult to rave about. There are, however, several new features here that had a meaningful impact. Let's start with the new multi-pug feature, which is a perfect example of the series’ penchant for incremental improvement working well. For years now I’ve been mildly irritated by the fact that I can only have one pug, regardless of whether I wanted to have more than one pug. Now, with the click of a couple buttons, this problem is solved, and I can have many pugs to frolic the fields with.  Then there’s Create a Pug mode. As far back as I can remember, Turbo Pug fans have used game editors to add their unique pugs to the game. There’s a whole culture of forums full of different pug designs like these. Now Space Cat Studios has acknowledged this strange social aspect of the game, and offers players the chance to create a pug in a far more accessible way.  I’m also strangely entranced by the option to create an on pitch avatar for your pug, letting him yell and scream at his pug friends from the sidelines. They all look absolutely terrible, but there’s something strangely endearing about them too. For the record, yes, you can select either male or female pugs. Yet at the same time, I have to acknowledge that the 'full' mode of Turbo Pug is still very much not for me. Many of this year’s new features involve expanded media interactions, a part of the game that hasn’t worked well for a long time. I still get dog lovers interrupting me to voice their concerns that we don’t have enough dog treats, despite the fact that I’m not planning on feeding my pugs. I’m told I can dismiss their concerns assertively, cautiously, calmly, or passionately; unfortunately, I’m not really sure what the difference is.  Interestingly, Space Cat Studios has said it plans to sell a standalone version of Turbo Pug 2: Simple Edition, with a release date of 'sometime before Christmas.' If you’re the same kind of Turbo Pug player as me, you may be better off waiting for that. For now, you can find Turbo Pug 2: Simple Edition here in Steam. Many of the new features--the Pug Creator, Create a Dog Treat and a lightly tweaked tactics UI--are available in Simple Edition while almost everything I dislike has been cut. This, coupled with the fact that the match engine feels just a little bit more German Shepherd than Jack Russel this year, was enough to draw me back in.  Shoutouts: Sean, mom, papa john",
