            "review_text": "I just started playing this game and all i can say is it deserves a review. The Playstation Network Games in comparison make this a AAA title under the said mini game category. The Soundtrack rivals hollywood production, the game itself I am blown away by how a guy like me likes a game like this. I grabbed it cause it was on sale and had a few bucks to spend on my wallet. It's relaxing, its more engaging than Technomancer for crying out loud which i took a break from playing to try this game. I'm telling ya I've got 5k kills in Metal Gear Solid V the phantom pain, half headshots half tactical takedowns and for crying out loud I'm into this, Don't be fooled by its colours or the bird theme or anything, its great game hands down, got puzzles dual analog controls for controlling a flock, bosses, great environment, 4k res, and its a game that anyone could enjoy, don't hesistate to buy it. BUY IT! The only reason why I'm not playing it right now is because I've got Revelation Online CBT to do in 5 min.",

            "review_text": "My eyes got itchy after exposing to its high-contrast environment in 2 hours, but it's worth it since I had to write a review about this game.  Thanks to my aggressive playstyle, I controlled an army of mostly red luminis and blasted the s**t out of stupid whales and other enemies on my way. Highly valued its continuous level design that kept me playing without taking a huge s**t until I reached the final level without realising I'd lost the purple lumini from the beginning, which explained why I could only control 3 types throughout the whole game.  The game is quite soothing but not so relaxing with occasional dropped framerate and bugs like when those luminis splitted into two groups but some of them got stuck in corners, especially in the forest level. At least its gameplay and story line are well-constructed thanks to the whole Speelbaars team. Good work, chaps.",
