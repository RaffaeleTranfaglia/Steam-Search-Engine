    "description": "In this world, three races — humans, sprites, and kindred — coexist with their own unique cultures. Some races are on good terms with each other, such as humans and sprites, while others may not get along as well, such as sprites and kindred, but they all live together more or less harmoniously.",

            "review_text": "tl;dr - I can't recommend this game at it's current price for the content it provides.  It's like a more technical and casual form of Recettear. I would recommend trying Recettear first before trying this one out. The story is very similar to Recettear as well, both Main Characters start up their family shops to pay off a debt. It's still a fun little tycoon game.  I would recommend getting the game when it's on sale and when the vram error issue is fixed, because it can ruin many in-game days of progress in an instant if you haven't saved before it just randomly happens. The vram error issue becomes more frequent the more I had progressed into the game making it almost unplayable.  I played the game on Hard for a challenge and it wasn't an impossible task to get to day 99, except as for my first time there was no way in hell I was going to beat Ornate Brand with the RNG like buyers. I could be bad at the game and there is probably a how to guide, or not.  Edit: 12/12/2016 The game is still filled with bugs, like the game having all the UI Text turning back into japanese and the store missing textues so it's just a black void, but maybe someday the port will be fixed. Still no trading cards available and it would make this buy a bit better if there was.",
