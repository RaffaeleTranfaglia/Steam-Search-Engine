            "review_text": "Three Fourths Home is an interactive short story of sorts. The main story, as far as I can see, has but one ending no matter which dialogue choices you make: the 'interactivity' besides picking your words is holding down a button to drive...while you read. The graphics were simplistic and didn't work that well in terms of the main story. The epilogue was done quite a bit better: it had multiple endings - some bad that end it early, one 'good' ending, all equally bleak - and the graphics actually fit the emotional tone of the narrative. Furthermore, at least the epilogue showed you the main character, as opposed to the main story where all you see is a car going along a background, and all the characters are merely heard, not seen. They're expressive enough but some facial expression would have been nice to go with it.  You'll notice I spent two and a half hours on this game. That was the main story once, the epilogue four times, going through the extras (including letting the soundtrack run all the way through for an achievement,) and then a final cutscene. So to do absolutely everything, less than three hours. Full disclosure: I did receive a free copy of this game from the developer. Do I think it was worth the time I invested? Only partly. Some of it was good, the rest I did not find a very engaging story - it IS a character study, do not assume plot of any kind. Will it be worth the time AND money that YOU invest in it? Sorry, in my opinion, no.",

            "review_text": "I'm fully aware of the fact that  Three Fourths Home  is more of a narrative experience, and that's fine. I decided to play after hearing  Kinda Funny 's Colin Moriarty sing praises of it, talking of how sad it was; how thoughtful. Sorry, it's not. It was fine at the beginning, but I probably only think that because I thought it was an introduction to something that was more than 40 minutes long. I was thinking I would be playing for about 2 hours, but alas. My fault. Anyway: the story is pretty darn boring, for starters. I felt little to no emotion. I couldn't care less about the characters. The developers attempted to build and develop the charcters, but in my opinion, utterly failed. There was nothing particularly thought or emotion provoking at all. We only get small details about a family that isn't in the best shape, and that's it. I don't really have much left to say except I was extremely dissapointed. I do not recommend  Three Fourths Home  what so ever.  By the way, your finger will be irritated by the end of it all.  ",

The story has this ability to suck you in and take hold. Like the first couple pages of your favorite book. Once you start, you can't stop until you reach the ending. The story is amazing and the character development is spot on. Put this one on your list to play for sure. You will not regret it.",

            "review_text": "I wish I could give this game neutral feedback, but as a fan of the genre (visual novels/short stories), I feel like I can give it a slightly positive review. The game is very brief, which is fine, and consists of two telephone conversations (one during the main game, and one during the epilogue) with the protagonist's mother. The conversation itself feels mostly authentic, but I was slightly distracted by the fact that the mother keeps simulataneously telling your character to be careful driving in the bad weather, but refusing to get off of the phone. That is a minor complaint, but the bigger problem is that the story doesn't really go anywhere. The Epilogue is a bit better than the main game, in my opinion, and I do like the very simple art style. If you enjoy story-based games, and can catch this on sale, I would say it's worth checking out. It's clear that quite a bit of care went into the crafting of the experience.",

Imagined how a simple conversation could turn into something so... intense that you would not like to talk about your problems, but still want to?  This game is more of a visual story. Being said that, I enjoyed this piece of work and loved it. The soundtrack is so good! The minimalistic way of putting it, the design and concept of the game, the way the story moves on from one part to the other one, just good. I literally got goosebumps in the end of the original story.  Overall, 9/10.  Also, get the deluxe edition if you can. Worth it.  PS: You would be disappointed if you would see this as a game.",

            "review_text": "Less a game and more an interesting piece of fiction, Three Fourths Home is definitely not for everyone. Mechanically, it's little more than a conversation tree, a simple keyboard mechanic that (literally) moves the plot along, and some minimalistic graphical effects. If you're looking for much beyond a plot and atmosphere, you're likely to be disappointed.  The heart of Three Fourths Home, then, is the quality of the writing. This is a strong example of the Iceberg Theory (think Hemingway) where the substance is in the subtext. Without giving too much away, this is a story about family and the emotional power of things left unsaid. When you figure out what's going on, it'll either hit you in the feels (I'll admit, it got me a little) or make you say 'oh, that's it?' depending.  Before you know it, the story ends. You can replay a few key decision points to change the outcome and stick around for a few achievements, but not much else. Because of this, some might be turned off by the price tag ($4.99 at the time of this review). I received it as part of a Humble Bundle and was not disappointed, though it did leave me wanting more. This, then, is the rationale for my positive review (if Steam had a middle option, I probably would have chosen that): the developers grabbed my interest, and I'd like to see what else they're capable of.",
