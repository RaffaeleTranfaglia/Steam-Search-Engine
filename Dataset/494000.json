I definitely recommend it for anyone out there who digs reflex-based games or is subscribed to /r/sweatypalms.  It's definitely repetitive, but that's a good thing in this case. You're on a fixed map that keeps getting filled with enemies and bonuses, and it's up to you to beat back the horde and collect as many points as you can.  To tell the truth, I bought this game because it only had on review, and it was negative. I had to give it a fair chance, and what do you know? It kicks ♥♥♥. I put it right next to Agar.io, Slither.io, and Unpossible. (Also very gratifying since I made the #3 spot on the leaderboard in under an hour hahaha suck it...)",
