            "review_text": "  In regards to Artifex Mundi games the old saying, if something isn't broken, don't try to fix it comes to mind. AM has found a casually fun formula that works on all their games. While the games are similar and have a similar story-line, so and so is missing, this person tries to find them and hilarity and hidden object games aplenty follow.. If you've played one Arifex game you've played them all, yet they all continue to be good casual games with similar but unique enough to have their own telling. The meat and potatoes of an Artifex Mundi game are the puzzles in particular the hidden object puzzles. Spend a few minutes to an hour searching an interactive picture trying to find hidden items. Many of them humorous, a few necessary to continue along the storyline.     The Story",

            "review_text": "Mythic Wonders: the Philosopher's Stone... Fantastic voice-overs (truly well above par for HOPAs), lovely graphics, relaxing music.  (Side-note: many negative reviewers are claiming the voice-overs are bad. They're either obviously not talking about the English-language voice-overs or they are possibly comparing them to trillion-dollar-budget games which can afford Hollywood stars as voice actors. As far as HOPAs go, this one has some of the best (if not the very best) voice-overs i've heard.)  Aside from a couple of the puzzles being... well, truly puzzling (in that it's still unclear to me what they were asking me to solve!), i thoroughly enjoyed this. Short, yes (i clocked just under 4 hours for the main story line), but a pleasant romp through lovely landscapes. Not terribly challenging, but i don't play HOPAs for the challenge, and i mention that aspect of the game only because it appears to be an important port for some (potential) players.",
