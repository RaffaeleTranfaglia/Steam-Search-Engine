            "review_text": " Tl;dr: It's a decent hack 'n' slash game with good artwork, can get repetitive, made primarily for mobile devices, DON'T BUY IT ON STEAM SINCE IT'S FREE ON DESURA. Read below for more info.   I bought this game months ago (during a sale, phew!), and at first I remember I loved it. I loved the artwork, I loved the hack 'n' slash. I simply found this through browsing Steam, not their Kickstarter. I used to love just hacking and slashing, one downside was that to get better loots you have to do the same missions a few times with higher difficulty, just like other games, but this one doesn't make the higher difficulty more fun, it's rather boring to do it again and again in fact. (Which it still is now.)  As of writing this on November 11, 2014, yes, this game is free on Desura. Yes, there is micro-transaction, which is because this game was supposed to come out on iOS and Android as well. However, reading the comment section of their Kickstarter, there isn't any news on the phone versions yet. The weird controls are a result of this game being primarily a mobile game. You only use mouse left and right clicks which can be extremely irritating if you normally use WASD to move around.  The developing team is literally 1 person alone, and he had 2.7k people back the game with a total amount of 200k USD. Despite that, I didn't have high hopes after downloading it again today. In August, 2014, in which he replied comments on Akaneiro's Kickstarter, the developer explained the slow progress was due to him being alone in the whole development, HOWEVER, after the Kickstarter success in February 2013, he had since 1 failed and 1 successful Kickstarter campaign, both on different projects, with the latest successful one in August, 2013. So is he slacking off on developing this game?  I was fine with just going along and playing the game like I used to. However, I couldn't even load the one mission I wanted to play... I'm sorry but for now, I cannot recommend this game, especially since it's made for mobile WITHOUT controls for PC players, and its horrible development.",

It isn't being developed, features that had been in the game (such as a usable map) were inexplicably removed, it lags even on fast machines, and simply isn't fun enough to recommend, even at $4.99.",

It does freeze about once an hour but that may be due to network problems with my satellite connection. This requires terminating the process to close it. Level progress is lost but gathered items are retained. While the game is not finished (and won't be) and there are a few item bugs, it's an enjoyable RPG that doesn't require much investment if you just want to run around and kill things. I do very well without much buying or crafting.",

It is a fun game but does not feel finished. try the game for free on their website. 6/10",

            "review_text": "It has potential, that much is certain. As it stands now though, the game feels like nothing more than a Free-to-Play MMO, quality wise. The stages follow the mobile method of finish one numbered area then move to the next which you will be scored in with gold and exp. Each single stage has three levels of difficulty which is unlocked when the previous difficulty is completed.   While this system works in mobile titles, it suffers here because it severly hurts the games ability to tell a story. Right now, before each stage, you are only given a small slideshow of pictures explaining the events leading to it. Very dissapointing considering the 'story' is actually what I looked forward to in this game. Red girl background and all.  All these said, the game is still in production and while I don't recommend it now, I will, hopefully, change my mind once the game is more complete.",
