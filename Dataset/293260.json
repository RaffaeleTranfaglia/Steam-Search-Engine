It's intuitive and simple to learn, even for people unfamiliar with this type of strategy game. There's a campaign story that is simplistic but entertaining, and meshes well with the cartoonish graphics. It's sort of a D&amp;D parody, but not in the sense that it mocks the genre so much as it embraces the sterotypes.  It is truly free-to-play, and though there are some paid aspects you can indulge in if you wish, there is no pay-to-win leaderboard aspect.   Oh, and this game does have dice rolls. Some days you'll get lucky. Some days you'll get milumbarred. It happens.",

This is how RPG games were played before the arrival of PC games. The whole idea of a virtual board game complete with cardboard cut out characters and quest book stories actually works very well. Its the sort of game you can drop in and out of which is great if you only have a little time to play. Now I would really like to see these guys make a kind of sci-fi theme version of this game.",

One of my favorite games of all time I have spent countless hours on this hidden Gem. The artwork, the story, the playstyle. All executed very well!  Pros + Great Old School D&amp;D Flavour + Is NOT pay to win at all + Likable characters in the Campaign + Fun competitive Leagues and online matches + Tons of Cards to collect + Opening Chest is super fun  Cons - Lots of Grinding, lots (which to some people this is not a con!) - No Trading (Which they explained why)  If you are a fan of Competitive Card Games, Board Games, Role-Playing games (although there isn't really any RPGing going on here). Give this game a try. With a beefy and fun Solo and co-op Campaign and an ongoing fun multiplayer environment with leagues, casual matches and custom made matches, there is a ton to do here. Best of all you don't have to drop a dime. (Although dropped a couple dimes here and there does support the development team)",

F2P with a pizza cash store on the side if you want to speed things up a bit or get some extra cosmetics. Co-op, multi-player, and even the community seems to be helpful.   If nothing else give it a try, the game itself is free. There are three 'DLC' to open up other game levels/content that you can definately enjoy the game without. The prices range from $19.99 for the basic set which includes 11 quests a month's sub, and several cosmetic items. The other two 'DLC's' are $12.99, and have a variety of quests and other goodies. Again, theres nothing you HAVE to buy to enjoy the game, just add on stuff and extra quests.  Bottom line, dont pass this up if you like pen and paper table top games. Do your self a favor and get this FREE game and give it a try.",

            "review_text": "In short, this game is awesome.  There is something of almost everything in it: RPG, turn based strategy, PvE-Campain, PvP-leagues, Co-op and collectibles thrown into a FREE game, which for once does not ♥♥♥♥ up one or multiple elements of the game to the point of annoyance, but not just keeps it all together, but does well so, which is just incredibly awesome.  If someone told me about this, i'd probably be sceptical myself, that it's not just working, but working so well. So far you can combine 3 classes with 3 races to form a group of 3 members to go adventuring/ battling monsters, which seems ok at first, not a lot maybe, but as the game progresses it becomes clear, that this rather simple template provides enourmous custumization through the collectible items, which don't grant the usual stat improvements, but provide you with various combinations of action cards, which you can use during combat, making for almost infinite combinations and various stratigies to play with.  And while the game introduces you in an o.k. pace, soon it'll test what you've learned, by mixing up settings, introducing combinations of big baddies, swarming you with little critters, or introducing something special every now and then, so you have to adabt your strategies, which not only keeps the game challenging and pushes you to steadily improve, but because of the collectibles and group system, also maintains replay value of already completed levels for the more enthusiastic player.  The gameplay is solid, the whole theme is a quirky, fitting homage to classical tabletop- and P&amp;P-RPGs and while the stories are negligible, they often provide a funny background.  And last but not least, it actually is free to play, with reasonable paying options, not just a demo, not pay to win, but you can buy special campaigns, cosmetics, or an extra (random) item to loot after each battle, which shouldn't give anyone an unfair edge, but actually makes them good choices to potentially reward the developers, if you like the game enough.  As the idea to play those classical RPGs with some of my friends seems to nerdy for them and my attempts to convince them with selfmade moduls failed, this transformation to the digital medium seems like a small dream come true to me.  For anyone who might be interested in any of these aspects, i say 'happy card hunting'!",

With other games, you are given your cards, play a few games and then leave the game due to a dwindling interest. However, I feel like that this game would be interesting even without the stellar gameplay. Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone who has some time spare as it is a captivting game.",

The multiplayer, which I swore I'd never touch at first - sucked me in for months. The fiction is best thought of as a cute gift wrapper for the game design, but honestly - it doesn't need more.   Finally, it just feels *patient*. You can feel like you've made progress with only 20 minutes at a time, if you like, or binge for hours. A couple of years ago, as a new father with free time at weird hours, Card Hunter was a kind of refuge of clarity and safety-within-risk. But that was just MY reason to fall in love with it.

It's got quite a good strategic element to it but it is quite heavily based on the luck of the draw. For instance in one battle against the final boss in a stage I drew nothing but movement and defence cards for three turns in a row and it was able to fully heal itself back up whilst I was left with no option but to run away, regroup and hope against all odds that my priest actually drew one of his dozen unusued healing cards still left in the deck and my mage would finally get a couple attack cards.  Admittedly it was satisfying when I finally managed to kill it after running around the whole level avoiding it for ten minutes but then on the next boss fight my mage drew three powerups at the start and then all my most powerful spells on the next go and just nuked it immediately.  It often doesn't seem particularly clear why this happens when my character's only have one additional movement card in their decks on top of the default one yet have a tonne of attacks and heals that rarely ever seem to appear.  The strategy comes from playing the hand you have as well as you can and that is good but it can be a little too random and unbalanced in this regard. I'm sure the multiplayer would be very annoying as a result but then I also suspect it is simply a pay to win job and not worth bothering with at all.  Like all 'free to play' games the in-app purchases are completely extortionate and not even remotely sensible. Rather than buying all the extra single player levels you could buy two or three good games on here which don't try and bleed you for money. If they were sensibly priced at $5 for ten levels or something I might be tempted to unlock them but the day I shell out $20 multiple times on in-app content is the day I want someone to shoot me in the face because I'll clearly be braindead...",

            "review_text": "Worth playing for a few hours because the campaign is quite challenging and fun in places but probably not worth getting really into. It's got quite a good strategic element to it but it is quite heavily based on the luck of the draw. For instance in one battle against the final boss in a stage I drew nothing but movement and defence cards for three turns in a row and it was able to fully heal itself back up whilst I was left with no option but to run away, regroup and hope against all odds that my priest actually drew one of his dozen unusued healing cards still left in the deck and my mage would finally get a couple attack cards.  Admittedly it was satisfying when I finally managed to kill it after running around the whole level avoiding it for ten minutes but then on the next boss fight my mage drew three powerups at the start and then all my most powerful spells on the next go and just nuked it immediately.  It often doesn't seem particularly clear why this happens when my character's only have one additional movement card in their decks on top of the default one yet have a tonne of attacks and heals that rarely ever seem to appear.  The strategy comes from playing the hand you have as well as you can and that is good but it can be a little too random and unbalanced in this regard. I'm sure the multiplayer would be very annoying as a result but then I also suspect it is simply a pay to win job and not worth bothering with at all.  Like all 'free to play' games the in-app purchases are completely extortionate and not even remotely sensible. Rather than buying all the extra single player levels you could buy two or three good games on here which don't try and bleed you for money. If they were sensibly priced at $5 for ten levels or something I might be tempted to unlock them but the day I shell out $20 multiple times on in-app content is the day I want someone to shoot me in the face because I'll clearly be braindead...",

Given there's no true pay to win or catchup mechanisms, however, PvP tends to be won by the guy who's been around the longest. Since this PvP is what most would consider the endgame, this means that the game eats itself as it ages.   Attempts have been made at making the game more evangelical. Leagues, particularly limited format ones, are incredible, and maps you create can be added to the game in the Mauve Manticore dungeons, which are finally firing once per month like they stated when they first devised the idea. Further, Aloyzo's Arsenal allows players to submit custom items which can be added to the game.  The issue here is that none of their evangelical work gets to the heart of the problem, which is that their loot design denies new players the ability to try entire categories of strategies - burst mage and vampire priest being the worst offenders - for their first months of playtime. And if a set of ranked maps favors these old-player builds for that month, well, Card Hunter likely has lower new player retention that month.  Basically, the game needs to ensure that there's no exclusivity. Stay to win is almost as bad as pay to win.  Still, play the PvE. It's incredible, and you'll have a blast.",

Blue Manchu has managed to combine the two types of game quite well. Each piece of equipment you attach to a character has a set of cards associated with it. This allows the player to quickly change their deck without going through and micromanaging every single card. In battle, the cards are drawn randomly from the pool each character has and are used to take actions. Movement, healing, attacking, and other status effects are all invoked by cards. This makes battles dynamic, interesting, and random.  There is quite a bit of content for free but the game can get a bit grindy at higher levels. Several expansion modules have been released that can be purchased in game. There are also a few other perks that can be purchased, such as an increase in loot drops and additional character images. None of this is necessary to enjoy the game and there is plenty to do without paying a dime. Blue Manchu has balanced the difficult task of having a free game that is not pay to win and is worth paying a few dollars for for players who really enjoy it. I would recommend getting the additional modules, as they are pretty fun and help level up a bit quicker.  I first played this game when it first came out so my Steam playtime doesn't represent my full playtime. I had taken a break from it and saw that it was added to Steam. With the Steam release is the new co-op feature. This allows a person to each control a character and take turns. This has been a lot of fun with friends and adds another element to the game since it requires focusing on a single character rather than the whole team.  I would highly recommend this game for RPG and CCG fans. The two genres are blended perfectly to create a unique and engaging experience. There's nothing else really like it.",

Had to go away for a few hours and returned home with some 20 minutes to spare before having to start fixing dinner... Found myself in a log-in queue for 16 minutes.  That totally blows. These queue things makes this game impossible to play a little here and there, unless you are very lucky and tries to start the game when noone else does.  EDIT:  Now they have increased the capacity and therefore removed the queue problems, making it a game that you can log on and just play a quick battle or two before having to do other things. Happy to see them fix this problem as quickly as they did. Shows dedication to the game and a willingness to listen to their players. Happy to change my recommendation to a positive one.  I strongly recommend others to try the game out, the idea that each weapon, armor, magical thing have a set of cards with different actions on them are a really fun twist. You have to decide if you should go for the item with a single strong attack and a few weaker ones compared to a weapon with the majority decent ones but no really strong one.  You also have to decide which of your characters should do something since you only get one action before your opponents have one.",

The only advantages of paying include:   &gt; Getting more items – You get more items during the campaign, there are treasure hunt adventures that can get you more items, and you can get more gold to get more items.  &gt; Cosmetic – You can get additional avatars  &gt; League games – You can join multiplayer leagues games, and if you win you can actually get gold, pizza and items anyway.  This basically means that you can get items faster, but you can always get items playing the FREE multiplayer 1v1 anyway, and that you can play the league games which are enjoyable.

Card Hunter is basically a tactical-board game where you have three characters who each have their own deck composed of items that you equip to them and the character's race (of Human, Elf, Dwarf, I would be happy to see more, but I have played this game since before it was on Steam and it has only ever had the three).  I am unaware of any pay to win aspects in the game. There are microtransactions, but they are cosmetic, or for expansion packs, which I am okay with. Most of the stuff you can buy seems reasonably priced to me, your mileage may vary.  The game itself can be frustrating at times, as there is a lot of rng-madness going on. Some games you'll draw non-combat card after non-combat card despite having a deck on the character that consists of a great many combat cards. Other games you'll get a plethora of combat cards, but not enough ways to actually move to opponents, which leads to having to discard all of your lovely cards. Most matches run fairly well though, I have had many good runs where I felt everything went well, but when playing with rng, you are going to come up to points that are frustrating.  The art style of the game is clear and enjoyable. The campaign story isn't terrible, though the meat of the game is the tactical combat, so the story isn't a major focus.  I recommend the game, it is a good pick-up-and-play game, lightly casual, but with enough depth to sink into.",

The game missed alot of simple things that would help, such as tile labeling for communicating with friends. The blocking cards on the AI are pretty OP, they roll a block at least 60% of the time and usually have 3 or 4 of them while none of mine really ever blocked. You reach dead ends that you have to grind 5 or 6 times before you can progress, which is around the 7-10 lvls. I havent gotten past lvling my group to 11, because I get too bored. I recommend downloading it for a quick go to game, but once you get into it a ways in you will get bored. If you buy any of the in game transactions you really wasted money. I could've seen myself spending $5 back when I thought the game was fun, but $20? LOL. I'm glad I don't have buyers remorse. I want to get to the higher levels featured in the screenshot, but theres absolutely nothing that will keep me playing this game for that long. The grind is WAY to grueling.  A year later I remembered this game and picked it up again, they seem to have fixed the unfair rolling tables. I still find their prices extremely laughable. Plus for all the 'is it pay to win' confusion, it's a 'pay to not grind' so you get things much more quickly. All who find this not helpful are those that paid $100 and are salty about it lol",

DL'd the steam version hoping they were satisfied with what they've inevitably milked out of saps with a longing in their heart for the ol' tabletop. Evidently they are not. If you want to enjoy even the single player element completely it'll run you 30ish bucks for the 2 'expansions' plus an additional SUBSCRIPTION fee (lol). Even purchasing the 20 dollar (ON SALE!!) premium 'basic edition' pack only gets you one month of their, frankly revolting, subscription based grind aid. Needless to say the multiplayer element is essentially pointless in any numbers game with a cash shop, so there's that as well.  Ultimately, the gameplay is pretty solid. I would definitely recommend giving the single player a whirl for a bit if you feel interested. Just do not spend a single red cent on anything in the game if you have any respect for yourself or video games in general. It is truly a shame they didn't just release this game on a buy to play basis for steam, or at least let you permanently upgrade to a 'bought edition' instead of keeping the micro-trans, and the ludicrous subscription-to-a-browser-game concept, firmly in place.",

The game on its face is fun, but the combat relies HEAVILY on random dice rolls. A string of bad rolls WILL mean that you fail a mission, no matter how skilled you are or how well you've built your characters. Add to that the enemies seeming to get very powerful cards just a little ways into the game (rank 7 missions, and even earlier) and it can get immensely frustrating incredibly quickly. It may be that enemies have smaller decks than the player characters do, which means key cards (armor, powerful attacks, etc) come up more than they do for the player, or it may just be my poor luck, but at the end of the day, when no amount of strategy can win in the face of a string of bad luck, I can't recommend this game. In my opinion, a certain degree of luck in games is fine, but when the ability to even make an attack comes down to luck of the draw, I think that hurts the game. It's not a bad game by any means when the other components are taken into consideration (art is good, the tone of the game is humorous, and the mechanics for character progression and deck building are fun) but it is very frustrating when battles are won or lost based almost purely on RNGs.",

Sure you can play for free but it quickly points out the things you won't get unless you pay. Even still, I don't have a problem with this system. You get to play and see if you like it and just not buy if you don't find it enjoyable. What I have a problem with is the insane price jump for simple stuff. For $19.99 you get the actual game plus 100 pizza (in-game premium currency). That's crap when considering the game isn't worth $20- No voice-overs just odd sound effects for dialog pop-ups, no live action, pretty basic boardgame style play with nothing all that new brought to the table, and certainly nothing compelling for a $20 game and this title has the nerve to push for a monthly fee (that is optional but still thats some bs).   I'm a frugal steam gamer. Thanks to steam sales, I've been able to enjoy amazing titles with little more than $20 (I tend to burn too much of that on beer and use the change for videogames :-() in my pocket at any given time. But this game will never compete with those deals (most recently Depth &gt;$10 for a full game and crap my pants fun!). The price for pizza is between $4.99 to like $98.00 (150 and 3,800 slices respectfully)! That's insane! This can be used for premium gear as the game quickly points out 3.5 hours in. I have mobile games that are more cost effective than this with better graphics and sound.   Short and simple is this, if this game advertised itself as a $20 FULL game on steam it wouldn't get a 2nd look but I'd at least have more respect for it. There are waaaaay too many titles (especially the random badasses that go on 80-90% sales for no damn reason other than that the sun came up that day) it can't compete with with at the same relative cost. This game hides it's price tag until play it and when it shows itself it is a bloated mess of cost. I would never recommend this game to my friends because with this cost structure they'd laugh at me, tell me to play Path of Exile, and to take note of how a real free to play game is suppose to be setup.

It had many components that you would think would fit perfectly well, but the main problem with this game is:   The game has this repetitive grind to it because it makes you fight the RNG (random number generater),especially near the end of the campaign.   The missions/modules/enemies always seem to have a major advantage. Never have I seen an enemy without at least one attack nomatter what when they draw while more than likely I seem to go for rounds without getting anything but move cards. Enemies sometimes come in hordes which seem not bad since most hordes just share form a single deck but the problem start to arise when you notice that while you take a whole turn to move one character, for the enemy actually takes one turn to move everyone.Theres also the fact that the enimes have better cards than you most of the time which don't make much sense for the levels sice you can only come in within certain levels and if your overlevelled then you have to lose some cards and power tokens to make it 'fair'  The game rolls seems rigged. I can't tell how many times that this game gave me a hand that could comlete annilate a foe but for some reason ALL its defence cards block everything, even when my cards have stuff like 'hard to block' or they have 'bad luck'(it essentially makes it s the dice roll goes down by 1), it gets so lucky and procs each and every block card.  I mean theres one level in particular which is called 'Return to the Astral Shrine' which essentially is impossible for me because even with armour destoying cards, bad luck and any other cards that make enemies lose cards, the enemies in that room just make it impossible because thay always have a card that blocks 5 damage, they only need to roll a 4 ad it doesn't matter whether is works or not they keep that card. But the problem with that is that they seem to always have one of those cards in there hand no matter how many times you destroy it! I mean I once save two cards that did 14 damage each so I unleashed it on one foe and it happend to have two armour cards which successfully rolled a +4 for both of the attacks I did, which lead to my attack that had the chance to do 28 damage to do a total of 8.  Overall, I think that this game has it's charm but the fact that even though it's free to play, it feels like it tries to rig the game and force you to buy so that you can actually progress.",
