    "description": "Deadnaut is Screwfly Studios' second game and follow up to cult hit, Zafehouse: Diaries. Deadnauts, so named because they’re unlikely to return, must explore, investigate and fight their way through the derelict ships of dead civilisations. Every mission is unique and no two locations are the same.",

            "review_text": "Let it never be said that I didn't at least try. I have played this game for about 3 hours, and it's been teeth-grindingly frustrating. I am being completely honest when I say I have absolutely never felt this level of animosity towards a game. Here are the biggest problems I can list, if and following that I will lay out in more detail my frustrations to anybody who wants to read that far.  1: Totally random. It's entirely possible to gear up your team and send them into a 100% impossible mission 2: Even when you know what you're doing, impossible scenarios will be thrown at you 3: No mod support. Don't like a feature? Too bad. You're stuck with it. (Devs have said it will come with enough player demand, but I doubt it very seriously just from their phrasing about the work it would take) 4: Some of the character flaws can make a character impossible to use. In an already ball-busting difficulty curve, do we really need that? 5: While in pressured suits, you can die of vacuum exposure. Excuse me? 6: Sentinels. Big evil guns that kill in one hit, can only be hacked once you've seen them, and tend to sit out in the open where you won't see them by any means until it's far too late.  7: You will be SEVERELY outnumbered and there's a good chance you'll find yourself swarmed by a very large group of armed to the teeth aliens 8: You'll unlock new weapons before you have armor capable of supporting it. Hope you didn't waste your currency on it too early.  9: Some of the contextual actions have to be activated from a certain camera angle, or else the menu will disappear.  10: Replacing squad members is too expensive for this kind of game.   So right there we have 10 good reasons to dodge this one. The concept kicks butt, no denying. I LOVE the atmosphere. I love the isolation. You, as the character, are the pilot of some nondescrepit kind of 1980s tech powered spaceship, and you control all the action through a series of 3 screens and a viewport. I have really felt the pangs of loneliness just staring at these screens, and overall Screwfly did a fantastic job of setting the backdrop and stage for their game. Truly fantastic. However, the gameplay leaves a lot to be desired, just like Zafehouse Diaries. I hate that game, simply because it's impossible. Every little thing you do will end in disaster constantly because the gameplay is half-baked and poorly implemented. But we're not discussing that here, we're talking about the poor gameplay in ANOTHER game by the same developer. First up is the gearing. You may either create your own characters, or roll the dice. There are 4 classes, as follows: Combat (carries weapons as primary) Tech (Carries hacking gear as primary) Field (Carries shield projectors as primary) Sensor (Carries sensor pingers as primary) All of these have a place in the squad except for Field. Because of the limitations of the armor, if you only have one field unit, you have to play favorites with your soldiers. Sure, you only need to extract 1 Deadnaut from the ship to be successful, but at a whopping 3,000Kn to revive the dead, it's pretty much a death sentence to do that. Now then, for the first 2 1/2 hours, I died in the first ship. Every time. I'd get somewhere close, and then I'd die. But this last mission is what did me in. I went into it as carefully as I could. I got lucky: Melee only enemies in a tight ship with decent integrity. That's the best setup you can get. I even caught the Sentinel on board and was able to disable it safely. But it all broke down as I was pulling the log. Would you know, the gen engine decided to place a teleporter on the bridge. I have 2 options: Either destroy it and safely extract the data, or let it be and face a steady stream of enemies until I can get away. I chose to destroy it, and for some reason that vented the bridge. Now here's where it got fun. Noticing that all of my characters were dying from vacuum (which above... Pressure suits. Explain this immediately.), I instructed them to grab the log and run back out the door. The door is now locked thanks to Watchers, which patrol the ship and look for ways to cause you BIG problems. Either way, the instructions were ignored. All of my signal bars were full, and I should've been able to get out fine, but nope. Nobody was taking orders at all. It wasn't until the first person suffocated that everybody else got in gear, grabbed the log, and another died before the door opened. So even in the most optimistic scenario, I lost 2/5 because of 'random' factors. I feel the need to say that I don't oppose the idea of rougelike games. I enjoy them from time to time. But when I encounter a game that I can sink 3 hours into and STILL not beat the first level, well I consider that to be a failure on the part of the developer. Do not buy this game if you enjoy your sanity. If it's the atmosphere you want, go buy Elegy for a Dead World. Much the same feeling of isolation and lonelyness, much less wanting to put an axe in your computer.",

            "review_text": "'How many drops is this for you Lieutenant?'  '38... simulated'  'How many *combat* drops?'  'Uuuuhh, two... including this one'  That's my thoughts on it so far after my first two games folks: You're pretty much Gorman running the show, except this time you're hanging out in Operations while you send 5 marines (and the tech guys lack weapons) into the Nostromo...  A Nostromo that's infested with Alien Queens and rogue AIs and hostile gun turrets.  This here's a hard game, and I love it it bits. Highly recommended for those who like a tactical challenge where things can (make that WILL) go wrong; being able to adapt accordingly to surprises is the name of the game. If you can't, you will learn to do so :)  Always remember: Your plan will not survive contact with the enemy :D",

Durning missions you will face random problems like radios malfunctions to interfance storms  ussualy if the captain ( player) deals with them cool headed, he will be able to solve most upcoming problems, however sometime's one small ship malufction could lead to the dead of your team  This will make the game more tenste &amp; interesting ontop of that you will allso have to deal with the aliens, you will come across diffrent kinds and each of them is diffrent some are weak against bullets while others are slow.. However sometime's you will come across a really deathly kind and for those you might want to try to counter becauce if you dont. . . it might cost you a couple of crew members     Storyline  The storyline is simple you are a captain of a salavage team who's going to salavege xenos vessels  Eachtime the game will generate random background story   the game is mostly build around the idea that you will have your own storys to tell however i feel the game is build too mutch around this and the fact there's no voice storyteller in the game Just saddens me   Technical  The game is fairly well programmed, I dont have problems regarding frame drops and i havent encounteted game Breaking bug  You only need a decent Ram card for the rest a simple CPU &amp; Video card will do fine    Mechancis  There are allot of random generator mechanics build into the game. For example there is a R.G for encounters / Missions / Enamies / loot / Crew / lore  One partically interesting Random generator mechanic would be the one that they have build for the aliens, you will never come acorss the same kind alien  in another campaign offering a refreshing &amp; interesting expirance eachtime  i have Allso noticed there's a deep charater creation mode where inn you can  add new possible Crew members for your salvage missions, The CC mode is well build and give you the option to give a crew memeber a real background  However there are mechanics that need inprovement like combat &amp; Ingame Acitions they are fairly limited, Allso the loot mechanics needs inprovement  the game simply lacks interesting loot    Sound  The music &amp; aliens &amp; Background sounds are really well done, it slightly reminds me of watching one of those old 80 sci-fi horror movie aside from that what's allso interesting that sound plays a role in the game for example it help you reconise what kind of enammies are behind a certain doors    Overview  Gameplay 8/10 Storyline 6/10 Technical 10/10 Mechancis 6/10 Sound 9/10   Finnal   Even though the game lacks certain game mechanics &amp; Feature's this game caught my attention It's fun &amp; refreshing it's worth the money and im looking forward to the upcoming content   p.s this game it's hard &amp; unforgiving :,) be prepared for the horrors in space",

            "review_text": "A spooky randomly generated space horror narrative game! The basic premise is that you have 5 randomly generated characters with varying skills and quirks. You are playing some ship bound captain that gives orders to them to move around so called 'Deadnaut' ships. They are always in some way full of nasty aliens, and the aliens are it seems different. I got some kind of space ghost that infests artifacts that I had to destroy (which I learned too late my guns don't hurt). All of my team died except those in the heavy radiation suits who booked it across the dead creaking ship and got the information I needed. The 3 others are now clones with varying levels of DNA damage.  A must buy!",

            "review_text": "Let me preface this, I say 'Yes' to this game only because I see potential, but I was marginally disappointed in the full outcome.  The game has a lot of elements to it that make it incredible. - A great 1990s Futuristic style - A compelling mood that draws you in and engrosses you - A good range of customization and tactical planning.  The main problem is, at least for me, was that just as I was getting into all of this, the game ended. No joke, I bought and finished a campaign in under 2 hours. While the content was good, it was over way too fast?   DO NOT READ PAST HERE IF YOU DON'T WANT THE GAME ELEMENTS TO BE SPOILED---------  A few key bothers I have because the game is so short:  - Crew morale and relationships is a dynamic that slowly deteriorates after each mission. I thought that I would need to worry about this in the long run and try to be very efficient in my mission times before my crew started killing each other. However, the campaign ended before I saw any of that become a factor. A main factor of the game is these derelect spaceships causing crew members to go insane. Isn't that something I should worry about happening to my team as well?  - There's a wide variety of weapon types and similarly defense types. It goes from standard, light, medium, to heavy. ... I finished the game just as I got my first Heavy items. I was still using tier 2 weapons on the last mission, no problem. Not only that, Because it was my first run though, I just defaulted to run and gun, simple weapon choices and keeping my group together at all times. I expected to eventually be outsmarted or something, but it never happened. If I can just muscle my way through this game, what's the point?  - Crew deaths. you only get 5 crew members in this game. If one dies, you can clone him again for a cost of credits and also a significant hit to his or her stats. It was a terrifying revalation, and I was incredibly worried that deaths late in the game would cost me a victory, but I beat the game shortly after my very first death. This factor would be a lot more terrifying if I actually had to worry about long-term effects of making a mistake and losing a crew member.  - Storyline. Once again, this is probably one of the best elements of the game. Everything they do is kind of perfectly built around the ability to set the mood for this story, but just as I was getting curious about where the plot would go, it ended. 'Congrats, you found all the things. Have a gold star.' What? There was no closer to this storyline, just me making money, spending that money on better gear, and going on a harder mission thereafter for more money (rinse and repeat.)  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  All in all, great potential, but a let down in the end. This could've gone so much further and been so much greater. 6.5/10 is my rating, but up until the 'Campaign complete' screen it was going on a solid 9/10.  Hopefully in the future Screwfly can add a little more meat to the game before sending it out.  Finally, I don't regret paying $8 for this, but if they had filled in the holes, this game could be worth at least $30 in my book. It reminds me of great old strategy games like fallout and dungeon keeper with the creepy setting and unforgiving cost of messing up.",

Gorman is too shock to do anything and most the marines are trying to save themselves.  The game is quite an expirmental title which I see not fitting eveyones taste but I say it is a risk worth taken.  The feature of your solider running off when they had enough, panicking or ignoring you is a fun concept but for some it maybe frustrating espcially when you get so far in a campain, and the one fool moves off and in trying to save him everyone dies, it can make you want to throw your keyboard across the room. But at the same time it can be quite exicting to have a situation were everthings gose wrong, most soliders die but you get out with one and half troops.

I think there's a lot of love into this project, or maybe I just loved this game from the beginning. Of course, it has its flaws and some of the game mechanics never get to shine as others do, and I wish it had some more content about the aliens.
