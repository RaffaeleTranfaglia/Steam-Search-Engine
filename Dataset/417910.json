PRO's:  -Multiplayer ins not dead yet at this stage -Once you get paste the learning curve it is quite a fun game - Closest thing to a multiplayer brawler with up to a large amount of Players in a game brawling at once that feels like a old school doulbe dragon type game that exists at this stage  CONS -Very obvious that the game was made by a small team as is obvious B Grade quality -Graphics are and sound is out of date and B grade -Progressions seems slow But looking at the leader board seems currently it on goes to level 10 anyway. -element of pay to win (But luckly is not impossible to beat paying customers) -Can only have one character so you have to be really careful what class you choose at the begining  Being it is the only game like this I want to support it by posting a good review in the hopes that perhaps if Crazy Rocks Studios is successful enough they may actually be able to make this more like a triple A title or make a better seqeal in the future.   or even if a larger company sees Crazy Rocks's success and makes a game simular to this with better everything ",
