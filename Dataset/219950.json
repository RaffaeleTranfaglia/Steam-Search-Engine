            "review_text": "This has been one of my favourite games since the Saturn, and this version is pretty much the same game with shinier graphics. I haven't had any technical problems with it so far and the controller is smoother to play with than a Saturn controller. NiGHTs is difficult to compare with other games, it is like a platformer but with lots of flashy acrobatic flying around the screen instead of jumping. The system will take a lot of getting used to but after that it's actually quite a simple game to play. It is good for short play sessions, most of the challenge will come from trying to beat your own scores as the process of completing the game is quite easy. The story and world are fun, you are in a dream world being invaded by nightmares, it ranges from chill-out to surreal to faintly creepy. There is no death, only running out of time, but the timing can be very tight and enemies will knock 5 seconds off your 120 second time limit. The music is pretty cool, if a little experimental.",

            "review_text": "I find it unfortunate that Sega had flailed about so badly after their glory days of the Sega Genesis, and I admit to an uncommon difference of opinion that I found Sega much more compelling during its declining days of the Saturn and Dreamcast. To be sure, the Saturn was ineptly engineered, but it possessed a handful of absolutely beautiful gems that were not to be found anywhere else. Among them, Nights Into Dreams.  The beauty within Nights isn't about any one thing, but the experience taken as a whole. Gameplay is simple time-trial courses, but the whole 'child's dream land' themepark combined with the grace of acrobatic flight is positively surreal. Each of the end stage bosses is its own deviously crafted challenge.   I was ecstatic when Nights first came to Steam, as it brought Nights back from an obscure past of long dead gaming consoles for more people to enjoy. Understand that for all my gushing -- I had played Nights quite a bit back in the 90s. These days I find myself with more games than free time (hence my rather low time investment in the Steam version). However, I remember Nights on Saturn as one of the greatest of classics, and the Steam release is fully worthy of that memory.  Nights is not the kind of game that will appeal to everyone. ' Andrenaline pumped 'this is gonna be epic' Bruce Willis passively sauntering away from fiery-splosive collateral damage ' type of gamers probably should keep on sauntering. But! For the gamer that appreciates a great video game much like a museum curator appreciates Vincent Van Gogh -- look no further.",

            "review_text": "I honestly only bought the game so that I could relive my childhood. One of the most frustrating and nostalgic experiences. I remember reading the guide that was in a gamer magazine to tell me how to beat one of the bosses. The idea of being in a dream world with a vibrant and rich world and lively characters fascinated me along with the idea of a novel Sega game that wasn't sonic (don't get me wrong, I love sonic, but this was a nice breath of fresh air).   And let me tell ya how much BETTER it is to play with the graphics being more solid as opposed to the Sega Saturn! (which I still have with the original NiGhts into Dreams. And I didn't have the analog controller, so it was freaking hard. So is playing on a keyboard.)  So yeah, really only thing this can offer me is nostalgia.",

            "review_text": "Ahh, NiGHTS. The instant I entered this dream, I was hooked, I became an instant fan of this flying purple jester. I have discovered this game a little later in my life, so I'm pretty much jealous of the guys who actually GREW up with this game. Must've been a magical experience for you all...  Anyway, my thoughts for this game. Played the Sega Saturn version of this game (on an emulator, at least), and it's controls are simple enough. At least two buttons to drill dash and two more buttons to do some tricks. With that, you're all set for a flying adventure that will make you dizzy and your fingers aching the first time!  Now what can I say about this port? It's everything I envision in its HD remake: smoother models, better resolution, HQ textures, and an actual main menu! The controls are also optimized well for PC gaming, and that's well appreciated.   The music? Still as good as ever! NiGHTS music really has this certain thing to it that distinguishes it perfectly from Sonic's musical scores (which is just as good, btw). I still listen to it from time to time and it really is a great music for daydreaming :P  The story? Unlike its sequel, the story really is a bit hard to catch since we're only given a few cutscenes explaining how Elliot and Claris ended up in the night dimension, and I get that each stage and bosses means something storywise, but it's always not easy to understand.  The bossfights? Creative! Each level has its boss, and each one has a different tactic required to beat them. My personal favorite is Reala's, because it's straightforward; no timing, no patterns, just aerial acrobatic action! After a while though, it's gonna get repetitive, so savor the awesome feeling you get in the bossfights while you still can!   Overall I give this game a 9/10 - you must try this at least once in your life! It's a good game, and one that will help you remember what being a child is like, should you forget.",

For one thing I certainly recommend you use a gamepad, cause this game ain't easy on new players.  If I had one complaint, it was that this version missed out on a few neat things from the original, including the Christmas NiGHTS Karaoke Mode. I saw a clip of it on Youtube and am very sad it wasn't in this. Either way, a marvelous game for those who need to waste a few minutes and like a bit of acrobatic challenge.

Graphics are a bit outdated but gameplay is smooth and well paced. Nights is a character that flies into sleeping children's dreams and destroys their nightmares.

If you were sleeping and then all of a sudden Segata Sanshiro came flying through your window startling you and showing you the Saturn console together with the NiGHTS Into Dreams game, you darn well play it or else. This game I played when I was a 10 year old kid having a Sega Saturn and other games like Virtual Fighter, Panzer Dragoon, Daytona USA, MechWarrior 2, and X-Men Children of the Atom. NiGHTS Into Dreams is a flying type platformer going through obstacles and avoiding enemies all within a dream world setting. Nights is one of my favorite Sega characters next to Pai Chan from Virtual Fighter or Gum and Cube from Jet Set Radio. The music is amazing the colors are beautiful and the gameplay is unique and enjoyable. Although the gaphics may not look impressive compared to games we have now it still holds up after so many years. I recommend you play with a pc or Xbox 360 contoller because it is a lot more fluent than mouse and keyboard. One of my most cherished games from my childhood.",
