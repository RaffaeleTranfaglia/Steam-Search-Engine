The game was only about 1.5 hours; but there are another 7-8 endings you can unlock. This story was pretty captivating, but I felt like I ended too abruptly in order to have so many ending.   This could have been an all-star if they kept rolling with the story and focused on 1 stellar ending. That's just me though I find reading through the same stuff just to change 1-2 answers differently boring.   I would definitely grab this visual novel for $3 or less. (It's only 1.5 hours)     Accidently Reviewed",

I followed the development and some of the VA's like Jonah Scott on tumblr and ultimately I wasn't disapointed  i really do recomend at least one playthrough just for the story. and I hope that the creators make more games.  soundtrack 10/10 voice acting 10/10 art 9/10 story 9/10 Characters 8/10",

            "review_text": "I'm only in chapter 4 of the game, but I have some constructive criticism. I've had multiple 'choices' to make so far in the game, however many of them appear to be completely inconsequential. Stuff like 'stay here' vs 'make a run for it.' Except the 'make a run for it' option has you recaptured a second after, and there doesn't seem to be any indication that it has any impact on the story that 'stay here' wouldn't have had.   In chapter 3 I ran into two choices, both that led to really vague game overs. Speaking of which, the game overs I've been getting have been very oddly written. It seems like the game expects me to be discovering these endings on replay, because they don't make very much sense. Almost as if I were stumbling into the end or middle of a game's story without any context. Like in one ending I successfully meet a character I needed to meet. Then the game ends with 'Was this the right one?' 'No. But I can't say why. Sorry.'   It is too early to really render a final verdict, but my initial impression isn't as good as I was hoping. If you're a fan of VR's, itching for a new one to play, and don't mind dropping the 11-12 dollars, then based on my current impressions I'd say maybe go for this.",
