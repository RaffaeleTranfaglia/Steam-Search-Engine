            "review_text": " I  seriously don't know how to start this review. There's so much to say about this game. I think I should start by shouting huge cheerish THANK YOU! To Jake Huhman, the game's sole developer and publisher. Not only because he made an amazing game, but because he's a great friendly guy, really caring about his game and it's players. The amount of work he put into his game is astounding, fixing bugs, releasing frequent updates and inserting loads of references and little details and jokes anywhere where's some text.  Look at Floor names . He hangs out around the forums a lot, and likes to chat about ideas. So once again, kudos to you!   N ow finally to the game. Let's put a quick  TL:DR intro here:  At the first look the game looks like a simple tile matcher puzzle game, and it truly is one, but I guarantee it's the best one ever made. It builds upon the simple concept and expands it to a strategy genre. For matching tiles, you get resources. For resources, you recruit units or build floors. To build floors, you have to make room in your Hoard, the stockpile where Loot falls from dead enemy Heroes, defeated by your minions, and after building a floor. Loot which you match to get MOAR RESOURCES. All this in quick cartoonish package filled to the brim with humour.    D on't get deceived by it's cartoonish pixelart look, though the game graphics are very creative, detail and expertly crafted to finest pixelart, all staying in the cartoonish theme of the game. Nice element is you can customize colors of resources.   I n the core, this game has a very complex systems built in which offer tens of hours of just explorating what Units can you build, going through Phropecies to 'building' your own game style, possibly retaining it through multiple playthroughs using the Legacy system. This system allows you to keep hero minions, items, floors and resource capacity in exchange for completing time limited quests, which range a lot in variety and difficulty. You progress through the game not only on the level of a single 'run', but also on scope of multiple ones, as you unlock new Floors through Phropecies, which for example require you to build several floors (sometimes ones which block each other), and recruit some amount of units. Each floor you unlock falls under a specific Tier, which form trees of possible combinations of units you can use to defend your dungeon. And as they are trees, to climb some branches you have to give up some units, because some floors block each other, as I mentioned before. Some floors work as traps, other allow you to recruit Mounts, which can your Biped minions use to roam the dungeon, offering considerable advantage.    E xpecting your question 'and what are they for?' I will explain. Your minions are defending you, because you are an extremely evil person and all righteous persons want to hang your head above their fireplaces. And they group at the dungeons ground floor, waiting for it to open, forming waves of trouble waiting at you periodically. All units travel around the vertical dungeon using elevators, and as heroes descend by one floor at a time, your minions can travel freely, patroling the dungeon in meantime.    G ranted is, Heroes will sooner or later be caught by your minions, and when this happens, the combat happens. It is turn based and works on cycling heroes in party, each taking one attack and defense at a time. Both minions and heroes have great variance of attacks, abilities and perks, some working as buffers or poisoning enemies. Those perks don't serve only for combat. If you have a general 'theme' in your floors and units, specific heroes come to defeat you, for example necromantinc dungeon resulting in holy heroes.    E xpanding the system even more, sometimes you can find items in your hoard which upon collecting serve either as passive effects to the game, active items affecting Hoard with for example spreading a specific resource or shuffling the hoard, or even serve as Potions on a specific floor, taking some time to recharge after each use. Another hoard element is that you can build specific tetromino-and larger- shapes to raise capacity of a specific resource stockpile. And if you need some more to fiddle with the game. there's possibility to move floors, even with enemy heroes in them, for a little price. Needing specific resource and your hoard is almost empty? You can refill it for a price of a little chunk of each of your resources. Want another? You can unlock Banners, which give you specific bonuses to your game, for example granting more mouse slides per move. And if you still arent satisfied, don't worry, Jake improves the game at a regular pace.    M y apologies for how long this review became. I kinda got carried away, as this game revived my belief in the inovation in genre of quick puzzle games, granting me tens of hours of intelligent, though-out and great fun, which I believe won't certainly end soon. To end the review, let's look at overal Pros and Cons:   Pros:     Simple concept, deeply and well-thoughtly expanded, with ongoing development.     Very nice and detail pixelart graphics    Offers a lot to explore and needs a lot of time to explore everything. And it's worth it.    Nice music    Deep strategy system allowing for your own game style, with large variety of units and items to use as ingredients    The game feels very alive, with units battling at multiple floors and roaming the dungeon. Seeing heroes run into sawblade traps is very satisfying.    Puns everywhere    Found out Fungus traps are OP (already balanced out), built enough floors to have over two dozens of Fungus traps, heroes died even without being touched by minions. Played the run for three hours. Got a 1st place global highscore and had it for a few days. 11/10 would try to gain highscore again.    Cons:     Terrible, addictive timesinker    Sometimes, the mouse control feels a little bit...ambivalent, but after adding the possibility to cancel your move on hoard with right click, these issues are not as anoying as before    Seriously, I don't know, this game is great and getting better with each update.   Thank you for reading, I hope I helped you deciding whether buy this game, treating yourself with an amazing logic game, and rewarding Jake for his work, as he truly deserves it.",

            "review_text": "Tomb of Tyrants is basically a Match 4 game with additional layers of strategy on top of the matching mechanism and a theme of building your own dungeon. You play the role as the titular 'The Tyrant' who claims possession of the also titular tomb. At the beginning it only consists of the throne room and a mystical treasure pile which represent your matching tiles. The goal is to survive as long as possible against the invading heroes who start to gather at the entrance of your crypt as soon as you start playing. The thing is, your Tyrant is pretty weak, he basically dies in one hit from anything. So in order to survive and send as many heroes as possible to their demise you need to start getting some defences up. You do that by matching the tiles in your hoard. Doing so generates your resources (there are eight different types and you get a bonus whenever you make combos), which you can use to build rooms. Those rooms usually come with some minions attached, who patrol your dungeon and engage the enemies. In addition, every room you build moves your lair one step deeper making it harder for the heroes to reach it, since the have to go through every single room and deal with whatever you throw at them. Your monsters eventually die and have to be re-hired for resources.  That is the first layer of strategy: Make as many matches as possible, build as many rooms as possible, survive as long as possible.  Could already be enough for a fun game right? But there is more!  There is a choice on which rooms you want to buy. At the beginning you have access to 10 basic rooms, paired in groups of two. You have to choose which room of one pair you want, the other one gets locked. That means you can have either Goblins or Kobolds. Either Dark Elves or Cultists. Either Zombies or Rats. This forms the basic level of customisation you can do. In addition, combinations of certain rooms unlock better ones cost more resources but provide you with better monsters. And certain combinations of these rooms unlock even more powerful ones. If you want Necromancers for example, you should get yourself some Cultists and Zombies. Therefore the choice of your basic five floors determines which advanced stuff you can get and allows for a great deal of customisation and strategizing. Mind you, it sounds very confusing to keep track of what depends what. But first, there is a in-game Wiki, that tells you exactly what you need for every advanced room. Provided you already discovered it, because at the beginning most of the rooms are not available at all and you have to try around certain combinations to find them. This keeps the game fresh. The minions have a good variety: You have the 'traditional' fantasy stuff like zombies, bats, dark elves and goblins, but also weirder things, like Deep Ones (from Lovecraft), robotic dogs (called 'Dobermech') and even the White Bunny from Monthy Pythons 'Holy Grail'. In additions some rooms don't provide minions but instead give other special abilities or are traps one can use to damage heroes additionally.   So this is the second layer of strategy: While building your dungeon, choose whatever you want and customize your dungeon to your liking.  But wait, there is more: Getting different rooms is nice and all, but there has to be a greater point than just bling, right? Indeed there is: By choosing certain combinations of rooms you can generate some nice synergizing effects. For example, one of my favourite strategies is to get a bunch of 'Gremlin Welders' who have the ability to heal monsters with the type 'construct' and as many constructs as possible. The reason is, that when fighting heroes, your minions form small parties on each floor and engage parties of heroes. They trade blows in rounds, and what they can actually do depends on their position in that group (a little bit like Darkest Dungeon). So when my Gremlin Welders are in the first position they hit the enemy with a flame attack, while in any other position they heal your constructs in the group. In addition some monsters are more powerful against certain heroes and vice versa. Since the game allows you to individually place any monster wherever you want you therefore can form some very powerful encounters for your heroes and allows for another level of strategizing. Another thing that plays into this vein is items. Some of the tiles in your Match 4 hoard can be special tiles. If you include them in a successfull match, they come into your stash as items to use as you please. Those are either consumables like healing potions that you can drop into the floors and buff your monsters, cooldown base activatibles that you can use to influence your tiles (like transform a number of them into a special resource) and passive items that grant global buffs, like making all your undead more powerful. The number of items you can have is limited, so you have to choose which to keep, which to use and which to throw away. Or sell for more resources if you build a special room. This further plays into your gamestyle, since when you have lots of undead in your dungeon you should keep that artefact that buffs them.  So, third layer of strategy: Monsters synegize with each other and with items you can get from your hoard.  But wait, there is more!  Eventually your tyrant dies, your dungeon crumbles and you are back to square one for the next round. But maybe not exactly back to square one. There is the 'Legacy System'. Basically, during your playthrough you will get timed quests, like 'Make 10 matches', 'Defeat 10 heroes', 'Don't spend a certain resource'. If you can finish a quest you get one of 4 different legacies, that allow you to save certain things for you next playthrough. Either floors, who will not get destroyed, one or more items you may especially like, resources or monsters. The later two need more explanation: While you do matches you have a number of 'Rituals' available to you, special matching formations that are more difficult than just 'A line of 4'. If you fulfill any of these your maximum resources go up. This is important, since you can not build some of the better rooms with the basic maximum, and it allows you to stockpile. And with a Legacy you can save one or more of these maximums for further playthroughs. The monster legacies finally don't allow you to save just any monsters, but your champions. Sometimes one of your basic monsters is transformed into a Level 1 Champion. They are more poweful and can gain additional levels to make them truly terrifying. You can either use them to form nasty encounters (I like to do whole groups of them just before the Throne room as sort of 'boss encounter) or send them away for a dungeon to pillage, which may result in some additional bonuses for your when they return. If a Champion dies however, they are gone for good. Except when you save them with a Legacy, then you take them to your next playthrough.  That's the fourth layer of strategy: Choose with the Legacy System what you want to take into your next run to get a nice starting bonus and hopefully do better than your last run.  And if all this strategizing sound too daunting just ignore it, match like crazy, build random rooms and just watch the mayhem unfold.  Two small critizisms I have. First: The pixelated art style might not be for everyone. I like it but others may not. Secondly: With a lot of legacies and unlocks, games can last for 1 hour. A possibility to save a running match to pick it up later would be really nice.  Appart from that, if you like Match 4 games, and the dungeon-building theme and like the art style, I really recommend this game for you. Especially for this low price. Also, the developer constantly provides gameplay improvements, new content (Rooms, Monsters, etc.) for free (No paid DLC so far!!!), keeping the game fresh, and is open to suggestions, which in itself is not as common these days anymore. Thumbs up!",
