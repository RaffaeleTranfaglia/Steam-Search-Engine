Build up your empire and your fleet and then use the power of the media to prepare your people for the inevitable war.

            "review_text": "I like the game, but there some serious annoyances. First the good. I love how the exploration ships are used for more than just exploration. That idea alone is brilliant.   The thought of purchasing your war ships through private companies and performing research through those companies is a great idea, but I do not feel it was implemented well. Perhaps if each company specialized in something or gave you a patented technology that only they could provide, or some incentive to pick one company over the other then it would be outstanding.  The game has that 'Just one more turn' feeling to it, I did find myself wanting to see how something would improve my situation once it was finished being (built or researched).  That is pretty much the end of the good for me.  When I first read the description of the game where it described how you have to use media against your enemies and for your friends, I thought that is a great idea. Unfortunately, it is horribly implemented in this game. First the concept of how it works is pretty vague. I pictured it my mind that I would run some negative propaganda against my foe, and he would do the same and a short while later we would be at war, but the reality is the opposite. In my game every time I ran negative media against someone, they responded with positive media, which pretty much negates my negative media, which ends in neither of us going to war.  As a sidenote, I find it ironically funny that I can run a propaganda item that says my enemy has been crossing our border illegally, but I can't actually cross my enemies border to attempt to start a war because we are not at war.  Unfortunately, I was unable to experience any combat in my game as I could not declare war on anyone and could not start a war no matter how hard I tried. The media idea needs to be rethought in my opinion, or just scrapped all together. If there is one good thing about the media portion of the game it is that you can influence your own population to provide research bonuses, or defense bonuses, etc.   Five races seems to be a bit slim, perhaps the developer is planning on adding more in an expansion pack.  It seems to be pretty stable, I did not run into any gameplay issues, no crashes.  I really hope the developer can make the game better, there are some great ideas here, but I feel it just needs more playtesting to iron out the wrinkles in the gameplay.",

            "review_text": "I want to like this, but I can't bring myself to say that I do. The interface is horribly clunky, taking too many clicks to do simple things. For instance, if you have a production queue, you should be able to rearrange the queue instead of deleting items (and clicking confirmation) and then readding. Also, AI heaps a zillion ships everywhere and no way to make borders safe because fleet size is very limited (reminds me of Endless Space), while AI seems able to put its entire fleet on your border.  Also, turns take too long. I don't want to sit and watch every ship movement be resolved.  Some innovative ideas with this one, but it fell WELL short of my hopes. Sadly, this one is yet another 4x game should be passed over.",

            "review_text": "Please! For the love of God Save your money!!! Dont be fooled by what looks like a good idea, it's ruined by looooooooooooong wait times. and dumb Ai.  I went into this thinking that the dipllomacy part would be a really fun and nifty part of gameplay. Boy! Was I wrong. It takes 10 turns to do anything diplomacy related and then you really dont get anything from it. No trading no allies just an AI that's going to sit there and wait untill you get bored and declare war on them.  Next complaint. The Ai is a steam roller. No other option. It took me 200 turns to see my first bit of conflict and when I engaged there fleet it had 20 ships in a single tile... NOT FUN... Needless to say they rolled over all my planets and I knew, very safely that I wasted 20 dollars. Do you have 20 dollars burning a hole in your pocket and 4 hours to spend? Go to the movies....",
