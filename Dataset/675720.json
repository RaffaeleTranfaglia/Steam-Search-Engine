    "description": "Direct is a fast paced score-attack game. Play to unlock cosmetic ship upgrades and increasingly more difficult game modes. Approximately a 2 hour experience to complete, but still fun and easy to jump back into during a coffee break to beat your high scores. Addictive, infuriating fun!",
