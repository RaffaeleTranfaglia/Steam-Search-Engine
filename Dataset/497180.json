After 10 minutes this game will become your new addiction.Spent 2 hours building a 1800bhp Nissan GTR(Btw most mods work with this version of the game). 30 minutes of gameplay and the AI decides to ram me. I was sent into a pole, the engine flew out.   10/10 I would like to see the AI raging again.  EDIT: Check my screenshots to see how the game(+mods) look :).This game will regain popularity due to its steam release so expect mods for this version:)(100% compatible, some mods will crash your game due to older version). Also most mods are made in High Quality rather than game graphics :D.",

Very glitchy, crashes more then you'd like, but I can't name a rice 'n race game with the sort of car building/modding experience as you get in the Street Legal series. Except maybe that failed Kickstarter for a successor by the same company. Ah well.  What I'm more interested in is if SLRR 2.3.1 will still be on the store in a week's time. I'm going to assume they have some sort of deal with Invictus if they're going to monetise a mod of their game, as old as it is. Even without that, this version's still a legal minefield. Music I wonder if they've got the rights to use. Many, many real brand logos (other then the ones included in the original game) throughout game pictures and usable by the player. Meme faces as decals (Important when the Trollface meme creator is able to get it's likeness pulled from PAYDAY 1 and 2). For some reason you can put the red Angry Bird on your car as a decal, I wouldn't know why you'd want to but you can. Real life circuits in the all-new Amateur events mode. Hell, the Flatout destruction derby arena was ripped to be used for the derby events. At least the 'base' game doesn't come with real cars, only the vague likenesses offered by both SL and SLRR.  It all seems to point to a group of talented modders who had no idea what they're getting into by slapping a price tag on a community mod and getting it up on the Steam store.",

You can't play Forza or Granturismo, and buy a chassis, chose your suspension parts, engine heads, pistons, turbos and super chargers, and build a car that you want.  Oh, and wreck it five seconds after you're done building it. Protip: Alt+F4 is your friend!  I've never played a racing game that lets you do what SLRR does, and I've been playing Racing games since Ridge Racer in 1993.",

Main problems include dumbass AI that always steer into you(atleast in my case), random crashes, sketchy driving physics, and rather steep learning curve if you don't know about cars. BUT, You start out with nothing and $20,000 to spend. Most cars you'll find will be rather crap, but if you drive right and spend right you'll end up with a beast of a machine. The paint booth deserves the most mention, though the decals are rather low res the paint aspect is really detailed. Overall I recommend this game if you really love modding cars.

After enabling compability settings (running the game in admin mode and Windows XP mode), the game now crashes significantly less. It now crashes perhaps one time in an hour, and as such I deem it playable. It is also pretty fun.   Coming from someone who had never played SLRR before the Steam release, the amount of modifications you can make to the cars in this game is pretty intense. Nearly any car can become a beast with the right kind of tuning. You can tune anything down to the fuel mixture and camshaft angles, which is essentially as much tuning as anyone could really want in a casual game. The 'game' portion of the game is somewhat lacking, however. The controls are fairly arcadey, and the races are kind of grindy.  All in all, buy it if you like to tinker with engines and turbochargers and wings, for that, it is unsurpassed, perhaps beaten by Automation, however that game does not allow you to drive your creations. This game does, and while somewhat lackluster in regard to 'career' or whatever you want to call it, it is still fun!",

The product is a game with the advanced functionality of assembly / painting cars. Here, they tried their best, replace and paint can be every single detail. However, for the purchase of spare parts for our cars we need money that you can earn only in races in this very car. Take care of your car during the race, because the smaller the damage - the less money you spend on repairs. What sways the technical parameters of the game, the graphic does not look presentable for the Games in 2016, however, this oversight can be forgiven thanks to the tuning machines. The physics in the game at the level, but to the ideal is to go. What exactly does not disappoint because it is musical accompaniment. Frustrating lack of controller, with which one could play sitting on the couch, as well as trading cards and achievements. Price would like to have a little bit smaller.",

But it's still an amazing simulation of what street racing is. Being able to build up the entire motor, suspension and body. Tuning specific parts to change how the car behaves. This game taught me what tires couldn't fit on my car, what spring rates and timing was. Mixtures of Gearhead Garage and NFS:U.  Do yourself a favor and pick up this game. I promise that if you are into cars in the slightest (building them), then this game is definitely for you!

You fear long loading screens because nine times out of ten they result in your game crashing. Text sometimes becomes too spaced out to all fit on one screen. Cars oversteer when they shouldnt and understeer when they need to act quick. AI will sometimes rear-end you at the end of a road race to no fault of your own, because at the end of a race it locks your brakes, disabling your ability to move.  These are just some of the many issues this game has. Easily the buggiest game I have ever seen. Don't get it until they fix some of these issues. Edit: I played this game more and still had the same issues and more. One main thing that ruins this for me is that I put probably 20 minutes into racing, and then a car rear-ends me at the end of a steet race and ruins my car, sinks me back down to 10k after I already had 25k and a 30k car.",

But the balance in the drag races is awful, 1 minute you can pull a win against a pretty stylish high powered street car in a cheap beater, next minute you get slapped in the chops by a hatchback when you're in a ferrari with a V10... Drag racing balance is bad and so's the prizes you get from drag races, and as for race track races, could never get into them due to the overly harsh restrictions on cars.  Plus the overbundance of crashes, go into my garage happy that i just managed to peel off a victory that was close as hell, only to find out i got nothing from it because the game crapped it's pants and crashed. Whether it be mid race or going to the garage. Crashes alllll the time. And. The worst part...  Settings, never save... Turning autosave off, then all of a sudden, it saved when i didn't expect it when i bashed my car into a wall and lost it, which ended the career.   So... For now. I don't recommend this game. If it got more updates, more cars, crash fixes and BALANCE. Then i'd recommend. Sorry devs...  --------------------------------------- UPDATE --------------------------------------  An update deleted my save game where i actually made some progress and to top it off it was a 'stability' update which made the game a whole lot less stable.
