In fact the choices you are given seem even more confusing and less meaningful than the first, however, the great story of the first is still intact so I still highly recomend this title. (NOTE: buy Sabres of Infinity before you buy this one because this is the sequal to the first) Now I jUst hope I will not have to wait 3 years for the next one! (: PLEASE!!!! NEXT ONE!!!",
