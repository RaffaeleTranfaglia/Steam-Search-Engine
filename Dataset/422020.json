            "review_text": "if you plan on getting this game don't, just save your money.  to begin with the voice acting is just terrible (it sounds like when someone is on tv but they dont want there real voice heard so they distort it) and the gameplay reflects it, i get lost easily in foliage there is no indication on where you should be heading until you literally run against the wall and wait for the prompt to proceed. The zombies are a real pain in the butt to kill in the beginning, the melee is bad as well. The cutscene animations are garbage (if i can call it animation), the mouse stays locked on your screen and that gets old fast. i wish those two men i helped sprayed my head everywhere so i would be spared of playing this game.",
