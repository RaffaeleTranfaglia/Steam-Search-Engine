            "review_text": "Hi people! HellAngel - casual indie -scroller shooter game about a robot with iron wings , who fights with wild boars , take over the world and have become tyrants . The game is a bit like real life simulator. It struck me as very funny and interesting. You can easily make a comparison with the government , wild boars is deputies , and the robot is a kind of superhero who wants to release . Therefore, I advise you to play this game. If you do not have enough of protest and struggle against injustice emotions , then you are welcome here . Now estimation Graphic : 6/10 Sound: 5.5/10 Story : 10/10 because its funny gameplay 7/10 _________________________ + low price + collection cards + good indie-game + easy gameplay + cool story ________________ - no achievement - no multiplayer ________________ All estimation : 7.2/10 I reccomend to all play this game",
