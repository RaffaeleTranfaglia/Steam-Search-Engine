            "review_text": "as an old school gamer i rember titles like: eye of the beholder and dungeon master, one of the very first dungeon crawlers. i would rather see these games cleaned up and re-skinned than play this!  its painfull.  painfully slow, painfull cluncky interface, painfull animations, painfull lack of sound effects, painfull NPC interactions...... the list goes on.  theres no leveling system to speak of, no real spell progression, no real tatics apart from wait till enemys in melee range and THEN use the bow. seriously, the bow, a ranged weapon, cant hit F all till they swinging at your front line. spells used are, unlock as theres no lockpicking (that ive found) and light (better than using a hand for a torch that could use a shield) and heal. theres no point in off magic as again the enemy is already in melee range by the time it will hit.  theres no wonder the video on the store page dont show gameplay as theres really nothing to hook you at all. even dungeon master (80s game) had monster animations, different weapons, more spells, player customizations.  infact i may dust off my DoSbox and fire dungeon master back up at this woefull attempt ive just played.",

            "review_text": "To echo others, this definitely comes across as an unfinished game. It just feels like a very early prototype, lacking in a lot of content...and it's just sad that it's not simply in early access, waiting to eventually flourish. As it stands, the dev doesn't appear to answer questions about whether work will continue on the game or not. Instead, it's $10 for a game that feels like a bare-bones demo of a 90's dungeon crawler.",
