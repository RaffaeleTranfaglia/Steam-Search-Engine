            "review_text": "Brief summary: Pros:  +Easy to jump into and have fun  +Should be able to run on the majority of Computers  +Huge amounts of replayability  +Workshop support ensures you can always try a new map or mutator out  The game's harder difficulties provide a real challenge to the hardcore  Most of the DLC is purely cosmetic  +The game is frequently updated with newer weapons (This might not happen anymore   as kf2 comes closer)  +Has a SDK if you want to use that.   Cons:  Some of the perks you can use aren't as useful as others  The hitboxes can become a pain at times  Some mechanics aren't explained at all  At times, the community can be bad(They're a minority)  Recent DLCs lock some more useful weapons away. Not too big of an issue though  Server browser is a bit annoying at times   //Long version//  Killing floor is co operative first person shooter where up to six british men can exterminate zeds,an experiment gone wrong.(There are are also a few women and a robot)   Graphics: Killing floor's graphics are decent and the art style of some maps in particular are amazing, and give out its atmosphere well. Don't expect anything spectacular though.  This game should be able to run on most older pcs just fine if you lower the graphics a lot and your resolution. Any good pc should run this with no worries.  This game caters to both casual and hardcore players. The objective is simple, kill all the enemies. It's easy to jump in and understand that you should probably kill all the guys trying to rip you apart. for those who play the game more often, the game can get really intense on the harder difficulties, where an understanding of each zeds mechanics is required to succeed.  Since this is a team based game, having friends along can make the experience much more better. Although if you're a solo player like me, the game is still a ton of fun, just a lot more fun with friends. Every enemy in this game feels unique, from the basic waddling clot to that guy with a chainsaw for an arm. Each enemy acts differently, and each have characteristics that separate them from the others.  The maps in this game are of a wide variety. Some take place in urban environments, some in factories, others in fictional lands. With the workshop, you can find countless more community maps.  The voice acting of this game is both a positive and a negative. It is humorous at first, but when you start playing a lot, it gets incredibly repetitive.  The majority of the DLC for this game is cosmetic, skins for your character or a camo for you weapon. There are a few DLCs which give you new weapons. none of them are completely overpowered but some contain useful weapons. I recommend buying these DLCs first.  At its price, killing floor is absolutely worth it. It also frequently goes on sale, so grab it during then if  you're unsure.  // Review end // I rewrote this because i noticed it had become popular, I updated the horrible formatting because it was not easy to read. I cleaned up a lot of the content and added a brief summary. Hopefully this helped",

About the graphics.. its awesome to 2009 higher and highest is very cool. Characters.... hahahaha the voice is so funny. Some characters like Mr. Foster is well liked by all,i really don't like the female voice but isn't annoying too. This game have characters that you can buy and some character (like Rachel or steampunk fosters) you only can get by achiev,so good luck... Co op.... Of course in this game you can have fun a lot with friends, but to find a team to HoE isn't a easy task. Soundtrack... Really cool i enjoyed it a lot.  Yes,i recommend this game.",

This game was fantastic and even though it was not Early Access, the devs kept updating it, and kept releasing amazing free content including some fantastic DLC. Steampunk Weapons Pack and Community Weapons Pack are pretty much essential and I was willing to pay that money because the devs more than deserved it.   This game has easily the best firearms ever made for a video game, the sound design is stunning, the satisfaction from killing enemies by a headshot in zed-time is OVER 9000.. There is very little I can criticise this game for, because of how much fun I've had with it over the years.   However it is not a a game that will be loved by everyone. It is hardcore in the best sense of the word, there is no melee attack besides the knife, there is no sprint button, the guns have massive recoil, unless you are using the appropriate perk. The levelling up can take weeks, but it is worth hitting that golden star. As a certified addict, even now, 7 years after the release I will still jump into the game every so often to snipe some heads with the Steampunk Musket &lt;3  9/10  *Ignore the sequel*",

            "review_text": "Overall Rating: 9.9/10  Review of the main aspects of the game:  Controls 10/10 Graphics- 9/10 (considering this game started as a mod on a game ~10 years ago) Teamplay- 10/10 The weapons 9/10 (could have more variety, but well balanced) Level system 10/10 Balance of the Zeds (enemies)- 9.5/10 (still die inside when 5 sirens spawn behind 2 fleshpounds, and 3 scrakes) Mods- 10/10 (Plenty of mods for reskins, more guns, more maps, even making money a weapon.)  Background information about the game for those who want to buy it: You, and up to 5 others if you want, are sent into a living hell fighting off zeds, human experiments that have been cloned by the thousands by Horzine as 'soldiers', in the good ol' queen's country of England. The zeds include clots, bloats, gorefasts, stalkers, sirens, crawlers, husks, Scrakes (SC), and Fleshpounds (FP). You have to stay alive for 10 waves of these horrible creatures that slowly gets progressively worse with/ as a bunch of psychopaths. Until the end of each round where you trade with a... horny? perverted? trader who will take dosh you earn from killing zeds (bounty) to give you more guns. HOWEVER! You can only carry 15kg of equipment (it increases if you're a support). There are 7 balanced classes in the game as follows: Field Medic, Support Specialist, Sharpshooter, Commando, Berserker, Firebug, and Demolitions. Finally, surviving all 10 waves you then have to fight the patriarch an evil clone of Horzine's CEO along with some lower class zeds. Killing Floor features 5 difficulties (Beginner, Normal, Hard, Suicidal, [HoE] Hell on Earth). These difficulties are built for higher leveled perks in correlation.  My personal thoughts about KF: So I've just clocked in over 300 hours and have started to get comfortable on suicidal difficulty. So i figured it was time to rewrite my cheesy review and do a serious review for, what is now one of my favorite PC titles, Killing Floor. I got this game around a year ago after i got a steam account for ~$5 and immediately fell in love with the charm this game has. Between the cheap one liners, slow motion decapitation, and heavy metal rifts. Also the leveling is very addicting at first, even when you're grinding for stalkers as a commando. However, i was just scratching the surface of this game. Although it has a great controls for a zombie co-op game, addicting leveling, and loads of teamwork on harder difficulties. The one thing not a lot of reviews talk about is the learning curve to this game, and how well situated it feels as you level up your perks you slowly learn more and more tricks and tactics in the game that help you survive until you finally get up to Suicidal/ HoE servers with 6 man teams. Killing Floor is so well-built compared to most games that start out as mods and has such depth to it that allows you to have fun even after you've played West London 100+ times and you're still not done with it. Not to mention how no matter how many times you successfully 1v1 a fleshpound as a bezerker, uppercut a scrake as a support, etc. you still feel like a bonafide badass. All in all, this game is worth every penny even if it isn't on sale, or was $60 dollars currently. Why? Because this game grows on you and will give you hours and hours of entertainment as you go from dying on normal due to 1 or 2 sirens to taking down the patriarch on HoE.  Summary?: This game is great, no matter if you only want to put 10 hours into it, or hundreds upon thousands of hours into it.",

            "review_text": "Now that the sequel has been announced I figured I'd write a review for what is perhaps my most favorite game of the past few years.  Killing Floor is a brilliant FPS survival horror, and perhaps the best (At least in my opinion) wave-based game out there. The game has a balance of gritty and serious environments and witty and morbid humor. The idea that you are working your way through a horde of genetically engineered monsters to finally go toe-to-toe with the final boss gives you that sense of achievement. And going toe-to-toe with the final boss is an achievement in itself; with traits from all other specimen  combined  and then some, you'll need a lot of bullets.  A key aspect of Killing Floor is co-op. with seven different perks to play as that fill different roles in a team, you're gonna have a hard time doing it alone. Synergy with other players is key; you could just as easily doom another player as opposed to helping them. There is a lot more to the game than it seems at first glance. All of the specimen have different nuances and behavioral quirks that you will need to learn to survive. Fortunately the Beginner mode is very forgiving so you have plenty of opportunity to get some practice in. However, the difficulty curve is like a brick wall; it's not uncommon for even veteran players to fall to the horde on even the lower difficulties.  The game is very community-driven. There are a lot of custom content for the game which is fully supported, and even some of the DLC and updates are filled with community-created content. You can expect new maps, weapons, enemies, characters, game modes and mutators.  Despite being an old game it still looks beautiful and has an incredible soundtrack. There is plenty of content for this game and the only people I wouldn't suggest this game to are the squeamish.",

To top it off, i found that i didn't have on-screen crosshairs!  Needless to say, the first couple hours of playing this game usually resulted in me dying rather quickly to simple enemies like clots and gorefasts. Damn those buggers are fast..  As i continued playing the game, i learned about ammo conservation, and how to make shots count. On lower difficulties you don't really need to worry about ammo too much - unless you're demolitions and shoot off a grenade at anything that moves. On harder difficulties though, you really need to make your shots count, since there are more enemies, they take more shots to kill and you get less reward money for killing stuff.  I have bought this game as a gift for several friends and had a absolute blast playing it.  Grab it on sale or something, its really cheap and there's really no excuse why you can't afford it.

I was something like enchanted from the beginnign of the first few hours i played this game. So much investigated potential. This game absolutly woths its price. Definetly. I never saw a better one. Believe me! 3000 hours playing time ad more cant have a wrong view on this game. And if you get bored, try some mutators, mods, other maps, mosnters, other modded servers. I played so much mutators and i still dont know every mutator which is playable. There´s so many workshop stuff.

It will surely give you hours, or maybe even days of fun. When you start the game, you have the option to play by yourself or cooperative. Since this is a family game, playing solo is not recommended as it will not give you the full experience of Killing Floor. The co-op games can have up to 6 players, that means you, your brother or sister, your parents, maybe your favorite grandparents and your pet warthog. The goal is simple: Have as much fun as possible! You and your teammates will be put in classic maps like kf_abusementpark and kf_hellride. Before you can play, you will have to select a so called ''perk''. It is recommended that all players play field medic, because their special funbombs have a lovely green glow when thrown, but I'll come to that later. After everyone clicked on 'ready up' you will spawn in the chosen map. Take a moment to look around in these beautiful places, because there are many things to be seen. I myself have found a sleeping horse, a dancing robot, a man with a television head, and a mini caravan. Soon you will realize that you are in fact, holding a gun. This is a glitch that should be fixed by the developers, because people might get a wrong idea from what this game is about. It is recommended that you press '5' to switch to your love dispenser. Soon you will hear the joyful cheers of the npcs in this game. There is the Clot, a little elf that will hug you *with force*, the delicious Gingerbreadman, the beautifully constructed snowman called ''Husk'', the Siren (who will sing for you) , Rudolph the crawling reindeer, the Scrake (I think he's made out of ice cream :3), the Bloat (Santa Claus), the Patriarch (Bigger Santa) When these npcs hug your or give you colorful flying thingies, your screen will get red from ketchup, it is really fun! Oh and.. ahem.. the Stalker. I'd like the developers to delete this npc, as it is inappropriately clothed. It does NOT belong in a family game like Killing Floor. I hope it is just a bug like the guns and other weapons in this game.   Overall this game is fun, and you (or a family member) should defenitly get it, but the developers should really fix the various bugs in this game.   pi/5 would play again.  ",

The seasonal events and the relatively recent addition of a campaign have helped keep the game from stagnating and kept people obsessed with achievements coming back.  Not really a fan of their more recent DLC, adding weapons that tip the balance to favour players who buy DLC is not something I can agree with.  The game is only truly fun when you're playing with people who know their stuff, and who communicate and coordinate with one another. Friends with microphones and reasonable Internet connections are what you need to make this game really work out well.

Whole cities are abandoned (or all inhabitants are exterminated, but hey, no one had time to inform you about that!). No one knows where you are, but as a cold comfort: most people don't even care whether or not you survive, so even if they could, they wouldn't help you. You and your squad are on your own, surrounded by experiments and weird humanoid-looking-ish fusions that are basically your worst nightmare, and theyre out there to eat you. Exterminate them all or they will have you grilled medium rare for dinner. AND AS IF THAT WASN'T BAD ENOUGH YET, once you destroyed enough experiments, the creator and 'father' of them will appear, and he wont be happy! But who could blame him? You'd be mad too if a random squad of 6 weirdos would come and kill hundreds and hundreds of your children! This is the premise of Killing Floor, a first person shooter that brings you to a (maybe not so original, but who cares, as long as you can shoot things) scenario in which you're the last men standing against monstrous opponents. With a good variety of enemies and five difficulty levels, this game is gamer-friendly for the newbiest of newbies and challenging for the experienced exterminator, whereas every different enemy will require a different strategy to get rid of when you play on the highest difficulty level. You will level up your classes on the go to match your characters abilities with the level you'll be playing on. With the 7 different playable classes (or Perks) you can play your preferred role in a team, so you'll have your favourite way of destroying evil: Fightin' (or kitin') like a MAN? play Berzerker. Steady aim, ready to take out the big threats? play Sharpshooter. Do you like to watch the world burn? play Firebug. Like gibs flyin' around and explosions? play Demolitions. Assault rifles 'n kalashnikovs 'n stuff? play Commando. Wanna be that guy that carries a million different (and heavy) guns? play Supports specialist. Do you love ze healing, not ze hurting? play Field medic!  This all comes with a sh*tload of different maps in completely different settings (woods, buildings, cities, north pole, on a ship, on the moon, EVERYWHERE), able to keep your interest for quite a while. Also contains objective modes to keep the diversity in the game.  STILL haven't had enough? There's an incredible amount of custom content with EVEN MORE perks to level up to even greater heights, additional objective modes with a wide range of different goals to achieve.  To top this off, your squad consists of whiny, cocky british people with a strong accent, so insults, directions and calls for help will sound hilarious! Despite many negative remarks on the 'crappy' voice acting, I actually think the lack of seriousness these squad members show with their snarky voice commands adds nicely to the game's attractiveness.  Pros: - A million different guns - Dont like guns? It has explosives too - AND fire - AND melee weapons - Playable at all skill levels - A lot of variety in the maps - Challenging and interesting action on higher levels (especially as berzerker in my opinion) - Enemies with chainsaws - A boss with a machine gun for an arm - ^I forgot to mention his OTHER arm is a FRIGGIN' ROCKET LAUNCHER - Has nice skin overrides with christmas, halloween and in the summer. - 'Help me or I'll be pushin' up the bloody daisies!'  Cons - By far not the best graphics (Don't get me wrong, they're not terrible!) - Camping to survive waves on high difficulty can get stale easily (but there's kiting to make up for that) - Not the most serious and realistic shooter (I personally don't mind, but I know many will see this as a downside)  'YOU MURDERED MY CHILDREN': prepare to fight, stock up on the biggest, baddest guns and bombs and sht and take the challenge! A great gore-spattered shooter that will be guaranteed entertainment for a long time!  Rating: 9/10",

            "review_text": "Killing Floor is a co-op game, where you can play alone, about experiments gone wrong and invading London (and the world too as seen in KF2 and as seen on some KF maps). Your goal is to survive 4,7 or 10 waves of enemies, while earning money by killing them (or by healing your teammates) so that you can buy powerful weapons during the minute of calm at the trader between the waves. After, you'll have to defeat the Patriarch, who is the sole responsible for the chaos. You can choose different difficulties: Easy (which is really to learn the game), Normal, Hard, Suicidal and Hell on Earth.  Enemies are thougher depending on the difficulty but you too can evolve and acquire advantages like spawning with a better weapon than a pistol or armor thanks to the level system. You have 6 of them and it takes time. However, you have different classes: medic (no powerful weapon but more resistance and better health), commando (rifles and can see stalkers from apart), support (big guns and better welder), demo (everything that is explosive), berserker (melee and also can't be grabbed), sharpshooter (sniper and headshots more efficient) and firebug (flame everywhere).  Enemies are varied: from the simple Zed to the infamous Fleshpound that can kill you quickly, without forgetting the Scrake and the chainsaw, the Gorefast that cuts you in pieces, the Crawler that loves your feet, the Stalker who is hidden, the Husk that launches fireballs, the Siren that is hurting your ears (and your health)....  Anyway, the game in its actual state contains many maps (some are official, others done by modders) and mutators with Christmas-themed or Halloween-Themed or Circus-Themed enemies (because they were parts of special events). The maps are very varied: fair, tunnel of love, Santa's workshop or cave, asylum, Horzine labs, urban town, mountain, hospital, etc..  But you'll ask me: what about the DLC? Well, all the DLC are cosmetic. True, you have new weapons in them and they can be used for achievements. However, you can do them with the standard weapons, that are enough like the AA12 for example. And you can unlock avatars by playing with themed mutators for example or owning other games. And that's how you own two Mr Foster (the normal and the steampunk).  Killing Floor in solo holds interest if you want to level without having a team to check or to win map achievements in Normal/Hard. An higher difficulty is better with a team, however, keep in mind that some of the players aren't using the perks for the team but for themselves. I've seen many medics choosing this perk for the advantages it's giving in terms of resistance or health but not healing at all the team for example. It's annoying as hell and if I seems to be upset by this kind of behavior, it's because I'm a medic first in this game, because I feel more useful by healing my teammates than beginning to put pipe bombs, welding the right doors or being a specialist of the crossbow. Healing is important in that game and if a medic is there, he's more powerful for the heal than the rest of the team. Not using of that fact can result in premature death on high difficulty.  Anyway, with Killing Floor 2, I don't know if there are still a lot of players there. I still need to win Suicidal and Hell on Earth achievements, as I've all Hard and Normal and that all my perks are lvl5+. But it's still worthy to play. As long as there are servers and as long as the solo mode is there, Killing Floor is really a very strong co-op game. However, make sure that you're not discouraged when level 0. By patience, by learning and by leveling, you'll find more and more pleasure to survive these waves.",

Since the game was debut in 2009, Killing Floor evolved with many seasonal events, free weapons and maps, and small cosmetic downloadable content to support Tripwire Interactive's longevity to Killing Floor. One would ask: What is Killing Floor? Well, Killing Floor is a six player multiplayer cooperative survival game that takes on against various 'zeds', ranging from the clots to the rage-meter Fleshpound that will grind your body into giblets. There are seven perks that you can select that varies from the Support Specialist with its ultimate shotgun barrage to the fast running Berserker that you will probably become the 'ultimate ninja' if you play long enough (Berserker is my favorite perk to use; it's really fun). The game may become a bit repetitious, but the maps, playing with your friends, or meeting (and making friends) with other players in the Killing Floor community will make you come back and enjoy killing those zeds.   Did I mention zed time (or slow motion)? There is and seeing zeds being decimated is an appeal to the eyes. The last question remains: Do you have this game in your Steam library? If not, go get this game..now! If you already have KF, go join in a server and have fun. For those who are waiting for Killing Floor 2, I will see you there when it comes out on Day One. Get this game and enjoy it as much as you can before the Patriarch attacks again in Killing Floor 2.",

I actually tried L4D but there was so much hate towards me as a newby i quit it. So Killing Floor. At first it looked like a trash. Then dunno how it sucked me in. Few enemies, all the maps has the same goal to kill everything (objective mode was came much later, still only applies to a very few levels), the weapons looks good though. So that's all? Yes! Try it! Not once but try it 10 times and you will start to feel the same thing, a fonding, a calling word 'Come back to mommy and pappy and kill us . . .if you can!' No matter how experienced i am after 500 hours if i'm not carefull enough even the singlest Clot can kill me. This everyday challenge, the weird-scary enemies and level design, the parodical amount of gore, the unbelievable good weapon system and the actual weapons and the teamwork is what makes this game one of the best games ever, and for me, the absolutely king of the multiplayer FPS genre.",

I am essentially a vet of this game, I joined in October of 2013, I played around in single player, being afraid of fleshpounds and the patriarch I seldom played it. Eventually after watching SSoHPKC play this game it inspired me to play it a lot more. I was 14 turning 15 and this game was my birthday money well spent. It's amazing, its fun, the music is brutal and grindy as are the steampunk(esk) graphics. IF however, you have not bought this game, two things, What in gods name are you waiting for and, please unless youre a left and remapped your controlls, its 'Q' to heal your self, 5 and click to heal others, Caps lock to voice chat and Right Click to aim down sights; and as a personal favor to yourself so you don't seem like some greifing piece of dung, please do NOT play HARD, SUICIDAL OR HELL ON EARTH AS A LEVEL 2! Please don't do those things and play it at your own pace. I love newbies that are fun and tenacious but no one on earth likes the scrub that shoots the Fleshpound on HOE as a level 2 medic and dies and complains that it's everyone elses fault, its not only annoying but very unsportsman-like, with all that said, this is a masterpieces baby &lt;3.

            "review_text": "  31 March ,year 2014.A very good friend of mine,asked me what game i would like to play:Borderlands 1 or Killing Floor.I did not had any idea what games those were...so i decided to take Killing FLoor,because it sounded awesome.And i was not wrong ;) Killing Floor is a coop game at it's best.You can also play it solo ,offline,but the coop is where all the fun is present.It features unique classes called perks,which all have their 'job'.Of course you can experiment,but you need to know a few things about a certain perk in order to play the game right.Don't worry,the community is nice and they won't destroy you because you are new to the game....unless you joined an suicidal or hell on earth server.Suicidal and Hell on Earth are the hardest difficulties in this game.So,if you are a beginner....better to play firstly normal difficulty servers.Don't play beginner,unless you are new to the FPS genre. The mechanics in the game are well implemented.For instance,if you play as a commando,you can either play only using assault rifles (which is commando's main job) or you can experiment with other weapons,since one of the special abillities that you get as a commando is the fact that you can reload ALL weapons with a fast speed! Yes,the perks/classes have all their own special abilities which makes them so unique/useful in certain situations.For instance, the Sharpshooter is usually the best perk for dealing with big enemies,because of his powerful weapons.However,he isn't that much useful when comfronting many smaller enemies...of course if you are skilled at sharpshooting,you won't have any problem,but you need to know your prioroties and not just shoot everyone or steal the kills (Yes Fetch i'm looking at you :D). Now,the enemies are called ZEDS.Not zombies-zeds.Cloned experiments that went wrong.Basically.There are not so many types of them,but their 'abillities' make up for it.They were (And are!) so well designed,that you will very very very hard get bored from them.I do not want to spoil to much,but they are a bit cliche,but still original on their own :) Guns.Very good.Sounds are well done.Also,some DLC's give you weapons which you can not normally buy from the trader (using ingame money that you get for killing enemies NOT REAL LIFE MONEY-real money you use for bying dlc's),but if a player owns a DLC he can drop t hat weapon to you and you can use it! Also,the DLC's weapons are very strong and useful,but even with the stock weapons you can be a real pro in games if you trained enough. In the end, Killing Floor,that originally started as a mod back in 2005,turns out to be one of the best Indie coop shooting horror games.It is fun,challenging,DLC's system is fair,community is nice (almost on every server) but in order to enjoy it the most,you will have to learn a lot of stuff.Of course you can have some fun without paying to much attention to t he game,but in that case,you will miss way to many things.IT also supports workshops,has huge variety of maps,achieviements,etc. and because it is from 2009,that doesn't mean that the game is not populated.Of course,player base suffered a major drop because of Killing Floor 2 (which is also great by the way),but if you buy this game,you will not be dissatisfied :) Thank you for reading my review.Have a nice day!

You can play it over and over and over but never get bored because every game has a different ending unlike left for dead all you do is get from checkpoint A to checkpoint B and kill some zombies on the way. But killing floor has like 10 different types of enemys THAT appear all the time not once in awhile. Sadly though it is $20 so save up and buy it. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Edit: OK review above ^ isnt too good..... was younger and dumber then and just loved the game so much at first that i throw out a quick review. Now the game dosent really change all the time like said above i mean sure there a different maps and 9 basic enimes that show up at increasing difficulty, then a boss at the end of all the waves. This game is WELL worth the money i spent i have almost 100 hours logged which sure isnt 1,000 like some but isnt something to sneeze at either. Graphics are decent arent to hard core but nice (espically some of the player created maps they are really gorgeous) Overall i would easily give it a solid 8.5/10 great game no doubt about it i HIGHLY recommend grabing this there are events every Christmas, Summer, Fall, and Halloween which keep it going after all these years after release (i believe dont quote me on that ;) ) Good luck out there survivors.",

            "review_text": "Alright, even though this game was made in '09, has graphics that would make make a grandmother have a stroke, AI that, in comparison to other games that were released in the same time frame, were clunky and irrational most of the time. Also included is a server browser system that has been known to drive people to insanity.  Few games have given me more enjoyment than Killing Floor.  The game is very simplistic in its objective: See zombie, shoot zombie, get paid, buy bigger guns, repeat. Even though this may seem boring while you sit there, in your 'gaming chair', waiting for your next game of Dota 2 to load, it really isn't. There is nothing more enjoyable and suspenceful than playing with a group of 5 friends (the game allows 6 people in standard servers), everyone dying but you on wave 10 on suicidal, out of ammo against 2 fleshpunds and about 30 other Zeds.  The gameplay is very enjoyable, especially on higher difficulties, like suicidal or HoE (Hell on Earth), where teamwork is absolutely essential for survival for all 10 waves. There are 7 perks, each has its own ablilities (like the Berzerker, which does bonus melee damage) and uses for helping your squad survive the onslaught of horrific freaks you're up against. The maps are varied and requie you to shose your perks accordingly, depending on if its a day or night map, or open space or tight corridors. The goal of Killing Floor is to survie all 10 waves to get to wave 11, which is the main freak leader himself: the Patriarch. If you kill him (no mercy allowed), your squad survives. If all of you die in the course of 1 round, you lose. At the end of each round, any dead players respawn, but only if there are still surviving players.  Tripwire has done a very good job of keeping players in the game durring its 5 years of release. They have done special events, such as The Twisted Christmas Event, or Hillbilly Horror (Halloween). Also, a steady drip of new maps, characters, and guns have fallen into the hands of eagerly awaiting fans, most of which are given freely, or in-game achievement unlocks. Even though there are several packs of guns only available through paid DLC, they do not affect game ballance in the least, but only serve to vary gameplay and team tactics. Also included is the complete is a very extensive set of od tools, allowing useres to create vurtually anything they want with the game; now that Killing Floor has Workshop, a hwole new relm of content has been opend to players.  Over all, this game has kept me satified for over a year, as well as Tripwire gaining my respect for thier devotion to their playerbase. Alright Tripwire, time to bring Killing Floor 2 to the eagerly awating masses.",

            "review_text": "Killing Floor is a multiplayer co-op zombie shoot em up game that requires lots of skill. I will break down the review in the sections below or you can read the conclusion at the end if you don't want to read the whole thing.   Gameplay:  There are two modes, the Killing Floor mode where you simply survive each round and the Objective mode where you have to fulfill certain missions. Only few maps have the Objective mode though. What makes this game hard are the gameplay mechanics, there is no crosshair and it is VERY easy to die if your team does not communicate strategy.  It goes without saying that the learning curve for this game can be higher than your run-of-the-mill fps, you need to learn how to use each class for which situation and memorize the maps by heart in order to survive in higher difficulties. Basically the game has seven classes, each with their merits and disadvantages ranging from melee to pyro to sharshpooting specialists and more.  You fight zombies in waves, a the end of each round you are able to use the shop to purchase armor, ammo, and weapons using the money that you collected after killing the zombies. Depending on the difficulty you start with 300 pounds if you are playing on easy, 250 pounds if on medium and so on. There are many weapons to choose from, ranging from regular guns to flamethrower to katana and chainsaw. The vanilla game contains large amount of maps both in open areas and closed areas, you can also download new maps from the workshop as well.    Graphics:  I will not be critical in this point, the game is from 2009 and originally it was a mod, so do not expect something of high quality. However it is easy to max it out at 60 fps even if you got an older machine (mine is AMD 4670, Dual-Core E5400 2.7GHz). Even though the detail is low, the graphics look clean enough and they do not distort from the experience, you will hardly notice them in the middle of the action anyway. However slowdowns can occur if you are fighting many zombies at once.   Sound:  The sounds in the game are average at best, the guns lack impact, the explosions don't sound good. But the monster sounds are very well executed. Again, you will hardly notice this anyway.   Online Community:  The online community is a hit or miss, I highly recommend that you play this game with a friend if possible because you will die a LOT if you play with strangers. Many players act like noobs and run by themselves to die at the end and never heal you or give you money when you need it. Thankfully though, in higher difficulties the community tends to be better because you really cannot survive if you play on your own so you are forced to cooperate with others and play strategically and communicate with your teammates.    Conclusion:  Killing Floor gives a new perspective to co-op zombie shooters, it is a real co-op game where if you don't play as a team you will fail. The various classes and the weapon and map choices will keep you busy for plenty of hours, each map requires its own survival strategy. Winning a fight gives you a great sense of satisfaction as you will die a lot. The only realy con I can find in this game is that you will end up with noobs more often than not if you want to chill in the lower difficulties. If you are a fan of co-op shooters of any kind, buy this game immediately, beware though it is very addictive.",

            "review_text": "Killing Floor is a first-person survival horror horde game with two different game modes. In the classic Killing Floor game mode you have to defend you and your team from several waves of varying types of zombies and defeat the final boss at the end. In Objective mode you have to complete a set of objectives while defending yourself and your team from waves of zombies and then defeat a final boss at the end... I've only just realised how familiar they sound. There are seven classes to choose from, which consist of your generic healer, shotguner, marksman, assault rifler, beserker, pyro and demolitions.  So, first of all, let's get one thing clear: Yes, that's all you do. I've heard criticism from a number of people sdtating that Killing Floor seems to be extremely repetetive. And yes, it is, but the game is so fun that it doesn't matter. I could argue that deathmatch on 'insert generic shooter here' is repetetive since all that consists of is running around and getting shot, and yet that's still fun!  But before I praise the game for what it does well, let's clear up on what it does badly: The voice acting is awful, but is still corny and funny. Hearing the pyro from Team Fortress 2 calling someone a 'plod' in a cockney accent thicker than paint is hilarious. The game looks dated, but that's no surprise considering it's running on Unreal 2.5; having said that it still looks like a really good PS2 game, so it's bearable. A few of the zombie types are a bit overpowered, such as the Siren, who's screams have a range longer than they look, ignore armour and shake your screen to the point where it's impossible to make anything out. The Patriarch's chain gun seems to deal a little too much damage, even for the final boss. And the Skrake has way too much health.  But what is the game good for? For starters, this game has some of the best use of classes I have seen. Each class has subtle yet effective buffs to their use in weapons, with the more noticeable ones being discounts for their weapons types, and spawning with a free class specific gun when that class level is really high. Every class can equip every weapon, and every class can be upgraded regardless of which one you're playing as, which is great. The guns are SO satisfying to use, and I really recommend buying the weapons DLC packs. At the very least, if you're only going to buy one, I recommend the Steampunk one. They are some of the most interesting guns I have seen in a game, and they are guns used in the more popular classes. What makes the guns so satisfying? The high, yet affordable costs, the size, the models, the recoil, the gorgeous sounds, the power, even the reload animations come together to create such amazing toys that are simply a joy to use. The maps are all different and really well made, even though a few too many are rather grey and brown, though to be honest, if I were modelling London, I couldn't have done it any other way. The zombie types are interesting and threatening in their own way, with each one possessing an ability that synergises well with all other zombie powers. Even the weakest variation, the Clots, you will learn to hate because of their grab ability that really screws with you when you're trying to backpedal away from a Fleshpound. If there are any two zombies alike, its the Skrake and Fleshpound, but apart from that, they're all different. And this game is a joy to play with friends. Do not get this game unless you have someone to play it with, it is great. And when you buy Killing Floor, you get two coupons to give to friends that allow them a limited time access to it so they can try it!  One last recommendation: Killing Floor is one of those regular sale products on Steam, so wait until its on an inevitable sale, and I don't think a year has gone by when it hasn't been on sale at Christmas. Simply put, buy Killing Floor.",

Don't let the 2009 graphics put you off - this game is still fresh and fun several years later. As of 2013, Tripwire Interactive (the developer of KF) is still providing regular content updates that help keep the game interesting.  How is the game itself? As I said before, the graphics are somewhat dated, but not to the point of being ugly. The sound design is fantastic. All of the weapons have a unique look and feel to them. The one commonality between all 40-some weapons is that they are all very satisfying to use. Even though some weapons cost more than others, there really aren't any weapons that are flat-out better than others. Every weapon is meant to fulfill a certain role and cater to different play styles.  As of now, there are seven classes or 'perks' in the game. Each perk has its own special abilities and strengths. For example, the Firebug perk gets a incendiary grenades and extra damage with fire-based weapons, while the Medic perk gets healing grenades and more effective heals. No matter what your playstyle is, KF has a perk to accommodate you.  Teamwork is at the core of this game, especially on higher difficulty levels. Generally speaking, if teammates do not support each other, the entire team will fail. The diversity of enemies and map layouts forces teams to be just as diverse. A team that cannot adapt to sudden changes in enemy forces will most likely die horribly.  As you can probably tell by my total play time in this game (365 hours as of this posting) this game has immense replay value. My recommendation to you is to buy this game on sale and play it with some friends. If you enjoy dark, gritty, and intense co-op shooters, you will not be disappointed by Killing Floor.",

TripWire is constantly adding more content to the game too, which is great. The more friends you have who are willing to play this with you the better it is, though. I've seen some lackluster reviews in the past and I think this is mostly due to the online experience not being quite as strategic and badass as holding off the hoards with a group of your buddies. Plus, the hardest difficulty is so damned challenging, it's really easy to get hooked trying to beat a map over and over (and you always make it SO close too before those four fleshies spawn in your face on the last wave with 30 zeds left on the clock).",

All levels are in England, and the voice acting is in a London accent which really helps bring that over, with the added bonus of it being hilarious! This could probably change in DLC but I have yet to play with any of that.  Second, the music. All the background music really helps to get the blood pumping and it fits in with the game really well to create the atmosphere. It sounds sort of like Korn but the original music was actually composed by zYnthetic and Dirge. I think Killing Floor is great for fans of Resident Evil or Team Fortress 2 because it is a FPS with zombies. The class selection is called Perks; such as Firebug - similar to Pyro in TF2. I really like how you can level up the perks just by buying and using the weapons suitable for them - for example with Field Medic you level up by healing other players. The maps work by you facing zombie hordes in waves, and at the end of each wave the trader appears for you to buy items with the money you collect in-game, and at the very end of the waves you face the boss: The Patriarch. The most important part of the Killing Floor is that a successful team will be more likely to prevail - without working together then basically you die a lot.

Best $4.99 i've ever spent on a game to be honest. In fact, i bought 3 copies for friends as well so that alone should show how much i like it.   Maps - Killing Floor has some great maps that give the players a lot of room for movement or kiting which is essential when facing the bigger bosses plus you get the ability to close doors and then weld them shut in order to provide a obstacle for the zeds (zombies).  Trading - You get cash (euros) for each kill and then at the end of each wave you can go to a trader to get more weapons or armor. If you or a friend is low on cash, you can press B to throw some on the floor for someone to pickup. It drops in increments of 50.  Community - So far every match i have been in, the players are very helpful and as a result i've actually made quite a few friends within a few hours of playing. The servers are very populated and there are plenty of them to choose from.  Gun Recoil - Gun recoil in this game is manageable but those who are used to fps games won't have much of a problem with this. However, those who are new to fps games in general are going to have a bit of trouble at the start due to the amount of recoil that some guns have. As you level your perks up the recoil will get better over time.    All in all i love the game and it was well worth the price tag, so stop reading these reviews and get it. NAO!   ",

Sure a lot of folks who play the game will have maxed out their perks and quite frankly, kick ♥♥♥♥ in a way that makes new players look like chopped liver, but that doesn't make it not fun. Its a shoot, reload, repeat kind of game, where getting killed is the point, the very first time I played I got my butt rightfully kicked, I jumped right into a server on normal as the berserker, had practically no idea how to play and got my my ♥♥♥ whooped, I kept at it, coming back each round and racking up 1 or 2 kills to other players 10 or 15, I was the only beserker and when the patriach came along I copped a rocket to the face, I laughed. After watching the zeds get turned into giblets I got hit by a rocket and turned into meaty chunks myself.  Pros: Large player base, empty servers are around but you can always find a game with someone if you look. Its fun to play with friends, especially if you like cutting, exploding and shooting things. Plenty of weapons to choose from Is a complete game Players are mostly a nice bunch  Cons: Weapons are based around their actual counterparts, where applicable. This can make the game pretty boring. Higher level players really do own the game. Newer players end up constantly asking for money, even after the first wave when no-one has money to give.",

They are the left-over 'specimens' from a cheap and dirty government program to clone soldier-monsters. The basic ones will just munch on your arm and try to disembowel you. The bigger ones were the first ones they tried arming. Nothing much. Just a chainsaw or a blade for starters. They had just got on to the chain gun and rockets when the government tried to secretly shut down their secret program. But, in the typical way these things go, the program didn’t want to be shut down. The specimens got loose. No-one was left alive to turn off the specimen-cloning equipment. And now they are running amok. Well, some of them are running amok. Others are shambling amok or even jumping amok, but you get the idea. The police were sent in, but that wasn't even a challenge for the specimens. The first army units hadn't been warned what to expect. The screams of its got a bloody chainsaw!' over the radios probably didn’t do much for morale, as whole units were chewed up. Quite literally, in some cases, of course. And now, there is just you. And a few friends. The few survivors from the first police and army units thrown in. Of course, you can’t tell anyone anything, because that would be a breach of the Official Secrets Act 1911, 1920, 1989. And that would be a disciplinary offense.

What makes this game so good is the amount of different infected people to kill, one type goes invisible, there's a guy with a rocket launcher, some guy with iron hands than goes berserker, a few more and the famous Patriarch. There's 2 types of game modes, killing floor which makes you kill X amount of infected per round and objectives asking you to do several stuff around the map like unweld containers in search of the materials to open the path. Also as you survive waves you can use money to buy weapons, armor , grenades and ammo, also to switch between perks if needed which il talk about next. There's a total of 7 classes and as you play with them you upgrade the perk level to obtain several bonuses like more dmg with class weapons, discount on those weapons, mov speed and unique weapon unlocks when you master it, the following classes are , berseker melee specialist, medic with really good smgs than shoot healing needles, commando, support, firebug who gets a really nice flamethrower at max level , sharpshooter and demolitioner , leveling them isn't really that hard it just takes a lot of time to max any of them. The game is extremely difficult unless you got maxed perks don't expect to solo or duo any map even on normal difficulty you will just get swarmed upon. Game is a bit expensive though , 20$ is not really worth it anymore since it's kind of old (but still stands out) and there's not that much amount of people playing the game, finding players isn't hard though, i'd recommend waiting for a sale and playing with friends.",

This is a fun game, but only with others, namely friends who you can Co-operate with through live communcation, because this game is hard. With a large array of enemies coming at you from all corners, the horror is real but you can fight back with an array of different class specilialites with tons of perks and abilities, the guns feel good and there are lots of them, all the maps are great too. Games can last at least 40minutes long on normal diffuculties alone, trying to do anything above normal is like having a having a ♥♥♥♥ing deathwish though.  You see, thats where the flaws of the game come into play, it's TOO HARD, diffuculty in games isn't a bad thing, infact it's rare in today's games, but Killing Floor takes it to a new level, you'll start off on beginner diffuculty, this is easy, really easy. Of course it's easy, it's beginner, so you step it up to Normal, you're going to die and die and die unless you have a very compotent team and a high level, doing diffuculties like 'Hell on earth' and 'suicide' will require hours upon hours of constant grinding on lower diffuculties, thats not so fun.  That brings me to the leveling, it's ♥♥♥♥ed beyond comprehension, there are six, yes, a mere six whole levels for each class, this doesn't seem like a lot right? Oh no...they've stretched it out so you need to grind for ♥♥♥♥ing days to level up and it gets tedious really fast, I'm begging Killing Floor 2 to fix this god awful leveling mechanic.  My final complaint, the end game wave.  While the previous waves consist of a seemingly endless wave of mutant variants attacking you from you all angles, the final boss is always the same. The Patriarch, you fight him alone to start with but he'll summon peions as the fight goes on, once or twice this fight will be fun, but the same enemy, every single time, for every single mission? Personally I'd like to see some variety in later titles with different end bosses for different missions, fighting the patriarch constantly gets old.  All my complaints aside, this is a great game, one of the best FPS survival shooters I've played, like Left4Dead with more variety and less 'A to B' and like Nazi Zombies but again with more variation and just a thousand times better, the horror is actually present too unlike most Surival shooters. Killing Floor goes on sale quite a lot so I reccommend you give it a whirl.",

Killing Floor is a VERY team-centric game, and while there may be people out there who boast they can solo maps while leaving their teams in the dust, that just doesn't fly in the higher difficulty settings, where the game really expects you all to pull together and perform your chosen roles.  There's no room for 'let's all go as the same class' a good part of the time. You WILL encounter monsters that are resistant to the damage your class specializes in, and your limited ammo will end up being chewed up way too fast. There's no room for 'I'll just go lone wolf' most of the time, since the game will  happily  spawn groups of monsters on top of anyone who decides to Rambo their way through a stage, ala  Left 4 Dead 1/2 . There's no room to not have a medic and/or support in any game with 3 or more people playing, since you'll end up facing waves of critters that will tear 1/4 of your health off of you at a time.  If you pull together as a team, and watch out for each other, you can roll over most anything. Hoarding cash is frowned upon, since you can only hold so much, and throwing cash out to put more tools in the hands of your teammates can only help you in the long run. Watching each other's backs becomes much more effective than simply focusing on your fronts.  Overall, it's a really well put together game, and a must for anyone who enjoys 'let's all cling togther' type action/survival games. It's got a pretty decent modding/mapmaking community, too, and that's really helped the game last for as long as it has.",

All the perks can use any weapon that the character can afford and has unlocked or bought as a DLC.

In this game you either play solo or with other people online in a map that the group chooses. You must survive each wave against different types of creatures. At the end there is a powerful boss.

After the tenth wave always comes the boss of the round, who naturally can endure a ton of bullets. After finishing him the round's over and the players normally can vote for which map comes up next. Also one can choose between some perks, which give boni for certain weapons. With them also come tasks, which need to be done in order to get the perk to its next level and thus resulting in better effects. There are 5 difficulties in total I think. It really ranges from ♥♥♥♥♥ to overkill, so you have a good chance to progress steadily. Also the game's still played by a lot of people, despite Killing Floor 2 being out and doing a good job of catching up to the standards of this one.

TL;DR: SHUT UP AND TAKE ALL MY DOSH! Veredict: If it's on sale BUY IT. But you may be better off waiting for the sequel that is improving on the weak points of the game.  Calling this game a ripoff of L4D is a gross mistake. L4D is a rush from point A to point B. It's fun, but it's a lineal no brainer. Killing floor is a lot more challenging. You can't run. You have to stand your ground until the wave ends. You have to play as a team, otherwise you are ♥♥♥♥ed.  You have a variety of weapons and classes- or perks- to choose from, you have to be careful about what you are doing in. Sharpshooters are mostly useless in the twisty corridors of Office, Demolitions blow themselves up there. Likewise, the melee class Berzerker is outclassed in open spaces where he can be flanked and surrounded.  And when the sh!t hits the fan, and it will eventually, all you can do is make a strategic retreat, shooting everything in your way to make your escape and run in circles while you kill the horde with precition attacks.  When you play on the harder difficulty settings it's one of the most frustrating but also rewarding games ever. Nothing can take away the satisfaction of blowing the final boss to hell in the Hell on Earth difficulty.  GOOD FEATURES: Epic slowmo 'I'M RELOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOADIIIIIIIIING' DOSH! GRAB IT WHILE IT'S HOT Classes to choose from and level up. B!TCH SLAPPINGLY HARD: The enemies are stronger and more numerous the more players are in the server. A chicken man firing a machine gun. Lots and lots of community maps that download really fast.  BAD FEATURES: Grinding. Lots of grinding to level up. Whiny casual players that quit because they can't handle dying. Noobs that join high difficulty servers with low levels and then die, leaving you with more and stronger enemies because of the dynamic difficulty. Subpar and OP meleee system. A good zerker can wipe everything given a lot of time.",

The premise is pretty simple; bad stuff happened at a biotech lab somewhere in the UK and you've got to fight them, the story doesn't actually matter except to explain why you're fighting what you're fighting where you're fighting them, though. The vanilla game consists of several waves of a set number of enemies (Zeds), the composition of these waves increases with difficulty as you go along, and the game also scales in difficulty (number of enemies and their health) depending on the number of players and, of course, the difficulty you set. Generally speaking you can finish a Normal round with a disorganised team of randoms, but by the time you get to Hell on Earth you'll need a well-rounded team who know what they're doing, so there's a lot more to the game - in an 'emergent', sort-of-exploity kind of way; things like how hitboxes aren't synced to clients so you can't always get a headshot by aiming for the head or how if you jump and look down while shooting certain enemies at point blank range the bullets can hit more than once, thereby saving you ammo - than you'd ever figure out for yourself.  All in all, if you have a group of people to play with, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this. If you don't and you just want to play with randoms, you probably won't ever experience the game at its hardest. The community, like many others, is a mixture of people who will accept new players and try to teach them and others who will kick low level players on sight. Which, honestly, is kind of justified; low level players physically cannot keep up with anything harder than Normal difficulty. ",

The only real problem is the team-issue with most of the randoms not being able to work together properly which is required to win.

'Pray and spray' is worthless on higher difficulty levels, and ammo is often sparse. To survive the intense and often claustrophobic firefights, you must coordinate with your teammates and make good use of the environment, welding shut doors to create temporary choke points, forcing the creatures to destroy them before comes and eat your face. Furthermore, you need to try and complete each round near the trader, who moves her shop between waves and opens for business for only less than a minute.  You can choose one of six perks that enhance your skills in certain areas and work like classes. For instance, field medics are faster at healing, commandos do more damage with the assault rifle. Regardless of which one you're playing at the time, you'll gain experience toward leveling up your perks every time you act appropriately ingame.",

But after not hearing much about the game, Tripwire pulled the same thing they did with Red Orchestra by releasing it, 100% polished, as a standalone game. Killing Floor pins you and a group of people (unless you solo) against waves and waves of different types of zombies. From the starter Clots, to the obnoxious Siren and to the pants-defecating-inducing Fleshpound, Killing Floor keeps you on the edge while still creating a sense of joking around with the over the top British voices demanding for LOADSAMONEY and other goofy phrases. There is a story behind the game, but I don't even think Tripwire themselves even care about it anymore (none of the character packs involve special military operatives like the original 4 default characters). It's a fun indie title that I personally think gets you more enjoyment than Left 4 Dead does, although it plays much differently.",

This FPS Co-Op Servival Horror game based on the UT2 Engine is very fun, not a game i can play all day every day, but on most days :)   With 7 classes to play and just over 40 wepaons to play with, some being optional DLC weapons, it makes for some gratifying zombie killing fun!!! The weapons range from duel pistols to a LAW rocket launcher, Flame throwers to a .50 cal Sniper Rifle...and some insane ideas that just make it silly...but in a good way.   Levels are well made with the environment changing from a wecked ocean freighter to the streets of london to a secret forest research lab and a deralict asylum used for rave parties, there is something new to see in every map.  a MUST for any gamer who is thinking of getting this game!

The gunplay feels like it has a real kick to it, so you actually feel like you are firing a gun rather than having a gnat sneeze behind you. The action is tense and you actually have to use teamwork to get through the missions effectively.

Nothing beats multiplayer though. Multiplayer: 10/10 One of the best Survival Horror out there. Tons of guns, 9 different types of zombies with an epic boss and up to 6 players in the same server. Use your perks wisely and kill them Zeds like there is no tomorrow! Graphics: 6/10 First installment of Killing Floor was based off a mod.

Overall I'd give it a B- for having an intense feel to it watching all your fellow team mates at the hands of a chaingun wielding maniac. Some mechanics of the game are a bit flawed however such as reload animations not playing, guns not wanting to reload at all, and some weapons not being able to be purchased even when all conditions are meet. Average visuals for its time but deliver the content nonetheless. The various specimen designs are unique in how they function and how they appear leaving the player with a satisfied feeling when they are brought down. The main drawback I've found is how downright difficult it is to host a server. Still that might just be me. For $20 however this game is worth it for its replayability and leveling system.

What monster what evil has come upon you?Once a promising nobel game who would never... could never exploit your new customers let alone your own existing loyal customers for (financial gain?).At last Killing Floor i no ye not for thou art but a shodow of thou former self for i can hardly see you as thou art coverd in thick haze of PAY TO WIN DLC.(thank you tripwire)For what can one do? give up on my favorite game of all time?(that tripwire did not make but was bought from a group of modders) .No i shall not give up i shall forge ahead i will play ye till my graphics card turns of dust and my processor blows out the side my case I SHALL PLAY YE...BUT i do not need to play with those who use PAY TO WIN DLC for i have my own server and on this server i have rules .So do i recommend this game? YES i do as i said this is my favorite game if all time.I would just ask that people think before buying PAY TO WIN DLC these have ruined the game in many aspects.I would not mind the DLC if tripwire would just put free guns in the game that compare with the PAY TO WIN DLC. .........For instance........  1.Flare Revolver..only two weight slots each have tons of ammo can put a SC on hell on earth into a flinch lock.  ..... where is the free counter part for these guns?.. 2.Buzzsaw Bow..the only ranged weapon for zerk class.  ......where is the free counter part for this weapon?.. 3.Single Piston Long Musket..this weapon is powerful 864 damage agianst a SC on hell on eatth while the lever action rifle only does 672 and the musket shoots faster.why tripwire why would you do this? at least up the power of the lever action so its fair...this weapon UPSETS me the most.. 4.Seal Squeal. only three head shots to kill a FP on hell on earth with 6 people. PAY TO WIN  ...where is the counter part for this gun?.. 5.Blower Thrower..PAY TO WIN.. i dont see any free med guns like this.  ...agian where is the counter part for this weapon... 6.Dr T's Lead Delivery System..R.S. Tommy Gun.. both are pay to win simply because the amount of ammo per mag.  ..why cant the AK get banana mags or drum mags so its fair?  Why is a game that is pay to play also PAY TO WIN? up untill the PAY TO WIN DLC i was hoping that a KF2 would come out but now im afraid..Will KF2 have a day one DLC and worse will it be PAY TO WIN DLC? i really hope not i would love to have my confidence restored in tripwire if they would just add free equal counter parts to the PAY TO WIN guns it would be ok ..but im sure they wont..tripwire has shown their true colors and it saddens me. ....................I hope there are other like minded individuals out there who share my thoughts................ ........................................But seriously tripwire get it together.......................................... ...............P.S. tripwire i hope you understand why i have not capitalized your name anywhere in this review...........

So I entered the server we both find and it worked, not private but better than nothing. The first thing I noticed is a Freaking loud sound, what was it? mmm let me remember oh right its a Freaking advertidvment for games from the same developers. And guess what? I have those games form the stupid Tripwire Bundle and it still plays the same Stupid ads. In the game, you can't run and it is just waves and waves of zombie with stupid voice acting.   With all that crap in mind, this game made me hate the repititve games more than I hated it before. Ads for things I have, stupid multiplayer problems (in a multiplayer game) and a boring game with a DLC each month. Not worth it, and not recommended. I would rather play COD Black Ops Zombie than this borken game that asks you to buy more and more DLCs. Each month is a new Freaking DLC and from the reviews the DLC wepons are more powerful.

The waves are too small (only 10) and the zombie hordes are too small. (Where are the thousand of zombies incoming games?) The weapons and the aim/movement/graphics is great, overall this is a good value for your money and I would recommend it. But it isn't awweeeeeeeeessoooomeeee.  I'm back again, cause I have played some more of this game. DON'T BUY THIS GAME! This game gotta be the worst game made in history, because everything you do, never get's saved. It's like you are wasting hundreds of hours into a game, for NOTHING!  There is such thing as 'Perks' which you 'Exp' Level up, but you gotta do damage or kill something, and you will increase your perk, well the thing is, after each game you played this perk status is never saved. So you gotta start over from ZERO.

That's not with an M....that's not with a G. Kilobytes. Basically the smallest download in todays standards. I sat and watched in disbelief as the percentage literally went up at a fraction of a percent every 2 seconds. I tried getting help from the forums and some helpful people posted some solutions. I looked at all these solutions and thought 'There's no way I'm spending a good hour or more trying to fix a game that shouldn't have this problem in the first place'. So I verified the integrity a couple times and tried again. It worked. I thought I'd give it another try today so I did. It did the same thing it did yesterday all over again.   For the play time I had it was okay....but it offered so little. This game came out in 2009. It's 5 years old now and the developers have a broken game with in game advertising and little to nothing to do and the game has overwhelmingly positive feedback? I don't know what's more sad....5 year veteran developers too incompetent to polish their game or the players overhyping such a dull experience. Don't get me wrong; I'm sure when it came out it really was top of the line. But again, 5 years has passed and there's a lot they could've added and fixed. I hope Killing Floor 2 will be much more polished and fun. But I cannot recommend this game.",

But thats not the point this game gets so crazy playing with friends. There are more zombies and there are more chances of death! But hey you have a friend there to try and save you this time, yeah!!! Anyways on Co-op you got to work as a team to get passed all the waves and kill the boss. When the boss is dead your squad wins. When that happens you go to a new map and do it all...over...again.. This is the whole game. There is objective mode but I have not played much of that. I am guessing it is the same thing. You kill zombies and do the objective and when you complete it you go to a new map. Now I know that sounds boring but it will take a bit, cause there are alot of zombies and the waves will take a bit so dont think you will win that much and get to a bunch of maps.. Anyways thats really all there is to this game.. So I guess what I have to say is play it alone play it with friends whateva its a fun game all in one. I give this game a 7/10.",

Some may think these are negative qualities, but it just makes for a great game to pick up and play for a little with some friends.  It takes itself just serious enough without drying everything out. All the characters' dialoged lines are hilarious, easy to quote phrases that give the game its charm, but it is still a serious and difficult game.  The community and developers are great. This may sound crazy but I pretty much only play this game during the holiday events in December. They update the game so all the enemies are reskinned to be Christmas themed. There are also holiday levels and remixed Christmas music. It just shows that the developers behind this game aren’t trying to make you cry or uncover truths about society; it's just an extremely fun and unique game that will that will give you hours of entertainment.  Also the game is pretty challenging, they offer difficulties ranging from beginner to Hell on earth, yet I still can get destroyed on medium without any hesitation.

            "review_text": "Killing Floor is a wave-based zombie survival shooter that takes place in a post-zombie-apocalypse United Kingdom. After some shady government experiments with cloning technology went awry, the CEO of the company behind the experiments, Horzine Industries, went berserk, letting his experiments loose on the world as some form of revenge. That's about as far as the game's story goes, though. It's basically just 'There's zombies here, kill 'em'.  The setup of the game is simple: Specimens (or zeds, if you prefer) attack in waves. Once all the zeds in a wave have been killed, you get a short, one-minute break in which the trader will open her store, where you can spend the money you earn from killing zeds to buy better guns as well as useful equipment like body armor and grenades. It goes beyond just buying bigger guns, though. Killing Floor offers you a selection of seven different classes to choose from, each with their own specific roles and abilities. If you choose the commando, you'll have access to a variety of assault rifles which are excellent for wiping out groups of lesser specimens, but you won't have access to heavy weapons like explosives which are good for denting larger, more threatening specimens. All the different classes complement each other well and even though the community may say otherwise, none of the classes feel flat out better than the others; each has their pros and cons.  In addition to the base classes' abilities, fulfilling certain requirements will increase a particular class's level, improving the bonuses you receive as well as giving you discounts for that class's weapons (as long as you're playing as that class, of course). Leveling your classes is important as well because Killing Floor offers five different difficulty levels. A level 2 support specialist is basically dead meat on the highest difficulty, but raising your support specialist's level to 6, the maximum, will vastly improve your chances of survival.  This does, however, create a small problem, which is if you level all your classes to the max, you'll find lower difficulty servers to be boringly easy because you're so powerful compared to your enemies, essentially preventing you from playing on those servers unles you want a very boring experience. It also is a bit of a problem since a player with multiple classes maxed out has an advantage over another player who, for instance, has only maxed out one class, just by virtue of being able to fill multiple roles throughout a match. This isn't a game breaking issue, but something I figured was worth mentioning.  More importantly, though; how does the game play? To put it simply: Fantastically. The different classes' abilities all complement each other very well. Nobody really feels like a one-man-army (unless they're insanely good); everyone has to depend on each other for survival. The guns feel absolutely brilliant, with great sound and visual effects. Despite there being only 10 distinct enemy types, they all add their own flavor of challenge to the game. Crawlers nip at your heels and attack in swarms, gorefasts charge you with reckless abandon, and the towering fleshpound will live up to his namesake. Everybody's role is important, and you almost never feel like dead weight (unless you're a low level joining a high difficulty server *wink wink*).  I should also talk about the in-game dialogue. This game is well aware of the fact that it takes place in the U.K. and announces it loud and proud. Through voice commands, you'll get to hear plenty of clever quips and unforgettable one-liners. Hearing another player shout, 'You're all fur coat, no knickers, ♥♥♥♥♥es!', is something that never gets old. While the characters themselves don't have distinct personalities, there are quite a few to choose from, especially if you drop a few bucks for some of the skin packs. Who knew a business man wearing a gas mask, a cop in a chicken suit, and a covert operative with an advanced suit of armor would make such a good group?  All in all, what Killing Floor lacks in other departments, it more than makes up for with its simplistic yet addictive gameplay. Killing Floor has received numerous free content updates since its initial launch back in 2009, and is still going strong even 5 years later. Would I recommend this game? Absolutely.",

            "review_text": "The best FPS zombie-survival co-op game hands down(until KF2!). Sorry L4D, actual strategy and enjoyably challenging gameplay makes this game genuinely intense and rewarding; and the replay value made it the best money I've ever spent on Steam. I believe I bought it for $10 on a flash sale, but this game is priceless. Player-made custom maps extend playability by a lot, and most maps were whitelisted so Perk progress can be made on them. Perk-leveling is a slow process, but each level adds invaluable advantages, especially at 5 and 6. As for multiplayer, the KF community is like most online mosh pits: an assortment of team-players... and guys who drop you for teenage 'lulz', just like any other online community. Solo-play isn't where the game shines, but it is viable in some situations; such as finishing a wave of zeds as the last man standing, and solo-play as a Berserker in particular can help split zeds up.  In short: Grab this game if you're a team-player mature enough to learn zed mechanics(KF-wiki); if not, there's always CoD, RUST, and DAYZ.",

The leveling up of particular classes requires time and plenty of kills but once achieved, the rewards are great. Discounted weapons to be able to buy them at earlier waves; more damage for when you want to up the difficulty (biiig difference when this happens); and different benefits depending on the class. It is a particularly fun co-op game (almost impossible on single player at harder difficulties, some achievement if you do complete it) because you need to work as a team to take down the hoards of enemies heading towards your group of survivors. Welding doors to make a kill corridor or just to buy you some time adds to the suspense in the game and is a great feature.  All in all, this game makes for a brilliant, fun, 'just kill em all' game. The only thing I could criticise (and this is actually just a funny point) would be the trader... When she moves to a different location, you can still see her standing in the old trade shop and she likes to run so far away that you struggle to buy anything in time unless you head there before the end of the wave... So much for that hold off spot you wanted to get back to ha! I highly recommend this game to anybody who wants to blast zombies to bits and do it with friends for extra fun.",

I mean various Specimens, each with a unique ability of their own, and each with better (and worse) ways to take them out. From the simple Clot that will grab you, to the massive Fleshpound that will pound you into fine dust, if enraged.  What's good: It is a healthy challenge on higher difficulties, where tactics and teamwork are essential for the group's survival. With a proper team, you'll be having fun, and a challenge. That is bound to keep players playing the game. You have various classes for various roles, so there is a role for everyone out there.  What's bad: Class levels. They take a long time to level up, and the game is unplayable on the highest difficulties without them. Hitbox sync is also an issue, but once you look into some guides on hitboxes, it is a non-issue. Also, avoid the Objective mode, it isn't worth it.  In conclusion, this is a solid game, which will offer it's best to the players that truly stick with it. It is good from the get go, but brilliant later on. DLCs are entirely optional and not required for success. You don't have much reason not to get the core game.",

The free content that has been released for this game is extraordinary. I would even go so far as to compare Tripwire to what Valve has done for TF2, tons of free, great, content. The only snag is the gameplay itself. Some may find it repetitive, while others will find it an enjoyable experience. I have 110+ hours in the game myself, and find this game well worth your money.  I do have to say that the game does go on sale for $10 fairly often so I would wait for a sale on this one. Don't get me wrong, it's a great game, but it isn't one you need to play right now.",

Expanding on that idea, Killing Floor's focus is gameplay, and you can expect all the bells and whistles of other FPS. Just. Shinier. Polished. If it were a cake, it'd be gunporn flavored and the icing would be neat but predictable AI behavior. On paper it's easy to strategize and complete a map on even the hardest difficulty. In reality, something always goes wrong. Even after hundreds of hours, the game still plays like a somewhat campy horror movie. The community is generally pretty good, it's still strong and its sequel is on the horizine. If you don't have this, get it. Just know that it has a load of DLC, some of which offers weapons you can't get otherwise (but will see other players use.) Can use a steam emote here? :shivahstar:  But really. Good game. I always fall back on it when I have nothing else to play. A lot of my friends do too. Never have trouble getting a full server of competent players. But then, we got into it before the semetic dlc.

Seriously, this game is my TOP FAVORITE, just because of how enjoyable it is. Yes, it may be old, and yes, it's not graphically impressive, but it's a damn good game. It has me STILL playing, even after hitting rank six with every class and gaining every annoying-♥♥♥ achievement. Why do i keep playing? Because it's fun, and because my friends have it. Playing by yourself on Hell on Earth, doesn't compare to the simple mayhem of playing with 6, or 64 other players (depending on what player-based mods are installed.) And, if you don't like the original ZEDS, you can re-mold them with extremely well-done mods like the Killing Floor: Dead Space mod, or the Aliens mod, to fight more horrific creatures. Hell, they even have mods to make the game ALMOST likle DOOM. Theres weapon mods, character re-skins, maps, VEHICLES, and so many other amazing things. This game gets a 10/10, no matter how people string the BS. It's a great game, and has some amazing re-play value when you're trying new things out. Multiplayer is fun, single player is fun, and PLEASE don't say that popping a ZED's head of with a M99 ISN'T satisfying. Because if you did, i'd call you a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ liar.

It's kind of like if Left 4 Dead was made entirely out of the special zombies, and added a few more. The zombies also feel more memorable and dangerous than the Left 4 Dead zombies because they synergy better together in order to achieve the goal of eating you alive. Each and every zombie type adds a certain strategy to the game, some run, some are bullet sponges, some do AOE's, and some are just ♥♥♥♥ing invincible. It's a hard game, and you kind of need to do Co-op for difficulties above normal, and don't worry if you're like me and usually don't like online, the multiplayer is actually pretty good. The only complaint I have about the game is there are almost no mods that you can get that don't disable perk progression for the round. Even a map that you like a lot and isn't totally cheaty won't help you level. But other than that it's a great game. ",

It focuses more on wave-based arcade shooting rather than survival, though the goal is to survive a preset amount of waves.  There are quite a few good pros to this game. First off, there is the variety. There is a huge variety of weapons bundled with the game. On top of that, there are somewhat overpriced DLC weapon packs. However, the weapons feel decent, and the gun handling is rather smooth. Now on to the maps. There are plenty of maps bundled with the game. Not enough? Get the Toy Master mod. Not enough? Check out the Steam Workshop. The possibilities are endless. On top of that, I believe there are some extra weapons on the Steam Workshop. Grab five friends, and prepare for hours of fun for anyone.   Remember that no game is perfect and there are some downsides even to the amazing Killing Floor. The gunplay, though decent, does feel rather rigid. Also, graphics are not top-notch, but remember the age of the game. Also, as previously stated, the weapon packs are rather pricy. Also, the game is rather boring when you take it on solo. It will give you some hours of enjoyment, but it WILL get boring. That is why I have low hours on this game. It is BORING in solo. If you want a blast in solo, I suggest something else.  FINAL SCORE: 92/100  CONCLUSION A good team-based run-and-gun zombie survival game.",

This game should be called 'Walk-like-a-granny-and-her-doggy-simulator'! I never experienced anything this slow in my life. Playing The Stanley Parabel after this game feels like playing Burnout. I pressed the s***t out of my 'W'-button to get, by any chance, just a little bit faster than this 0,003 miles/hour! I almost punched a hole in my desk while pressing the walk-button as hard as I could. I have muscle ache in my finger every time I play this game. I even tried to find a cheat to go faster (it works with the negative weight-trick, but it takes so much effort to do it every time)! I can feel my life passing by when I move. No, seriously, I feel my hair and my fingernails grow, I feel getting wrinkles in my skin and my bones getting brittle when I play Killing Floor. This game sucks out your life. But guess what - there is actually a button to go even slower...serious. No joke. I'm not kidding. This is for the real sadistic players who want to experience the full load of perpetuity in slowmo-hell. It's like a neverending commercial for shampoo where a beautiful lady shakes her voluminous hair to smooth jazzmusic. But just without the lady and the smooth jazz. Imagine just this slowmo-loop. And you're in it. That's Killing Floor. Why...why, oh why did you do that, beloved developers? Is this supposed to be fun? Well, It isn't!  Ah yeah, and the difficulty...wow. 'Easy' is really easy, but never think about changing it to 'normal', because then you will suffer a tragic death in minutes, because these stupid Clots grab you and you have no chance of getting away. Sure you can train to get better and master the normal difficulty, but there are so many better games out there (and faster as well) so I choose another one instead.  But ther is actually one nice thing in this game: the weapon desing. The weapons are really cool and fun, if the developers would just had invested a little bit more time in the gameplay than just the weapon-designs.",

The basic gameplay is the same survive zombies but where it differs is the classes and huge variety of weapons and characters. All the zeds serve a different purpuose on the field and though some are more dangerous than others they all pose a major threat in their own right. Extremely fun i love the gameplay and all the custom maps and weapons from the workshop. My only real complaint with the game is all the dlc being new weapons and characters, however i feel that the extra weapons although very powerful, do not make the game extremely easy and ruin the challenge factor of the game.

Killing floor has without doubt done it right, but of course there are some flaws ^^ :)  pros - It works perfectly and smoothly, and the grafics is nice - the mobs works great and good variation - lots of weapons, of course some of them are quite useless(but luckily only a few) - the perk system is great with its variations.  cons - the perk leveling up is a pain in the **** , of course you should use some time to level up, but it takes a looooot of time, no fun in that... - It is probably not really the game itself, but often in co-op people tend to camp, which means that you will likely use 90% of the time to sit on the same spot and hit the enymies in one directions. Of course the game developer has tried to remove this flaw by moving the trader around on the map, but yeah it often becomes dull very quickly. ",

Shortly after I decided to buy the game for obvious reasons.   I've been revisiting the game for pretty much every holiday update toghether with my friends and I've always had an amazing time. I've never taken the game too serious and always kept it at a casual level. But lately, since none of my casual friends play it anymore, I decided to take it up a notch and actually learn about the game and its mecanichs. And for the first time I suddenly realized why some people have up to 3-4k hours in this game.  There's a whole world of techniques and setups you can use to clear a level, the complexity of this game is beyond of what you can see at a first glance. Of course it doesn't have the skill cap of a game like, let's say CS:GO, but it's not as far behind as some people may think.  I've played this game nonstop these couple days and I will keep going for a while, and hopefully get more knowledge about the game so I can take down the Suicidal/Hell on Earth difficulties on a more frequent notice.  An absolutely amazing game, which I hope will keep getting updates sometime after Killing Floor 2 is out of early access, because it certinaly deserves to live on.",

This game is predominatly multiplayer as it can get quite lonley wandering the streets with a shotgun looking for infected. To make this game even better, there are 7 perks(Field Medic, Beserker, Firebug, Sharpshooter, Support Specialist, Commando and Demolition) which take a while to level up to Level 6 but it is totally worth it!

This game is legendary and is of its own, standing seperatly from the second in the franchise, it is a special game to me and hopefully to everyone else that had the chance to experience this piece of red art where british people with the same voice could enjoy a nice day in london against not-so-british zeds that wanted to eat british people.

It more than makes up for it in gameplay. In comparison to L4D2, I found this game to be much more emersive and kept me on the edge of my seat as I massacre through wave after waves of 'specimens'. Unlike L4D2 its is not rigid in it's gameplay forcing you to be purely team reliant however it allows flexibility in playing style as you have variety of 'perks' ranging from demolitionist to a medic (7 different perks in total), thus you are able to run around like a headless chicken carrying a sword. In all, it is a brilliant game that will grow on you and the quirky voice acting has left a real trade mark on this game, I LOVE IT (I killed over 70 hrs playing this)",

It is much better to play with friends for the full experience. The gameplay also adds to the attraction of the game, as the variety of enemies, as well as the original map design will impress. The difficulty levels also work well, with the 'hell on earth' difficulty presenting a good amount of challenge when you have the end-game levels for your perks.

There is something really satisfying about all the weapons, and upgrading your perks really adds to your combat effectiveness. Using iron sights is essential and firing 'from the hip' with no on-screen aimpoint adds an additional challenge but when you get good at it you feel pretty badass. Teamplay is essential and I love that 6 people can play instead of just 2 or 4 like most co-op games. Gameplay is relatively simple (fight off waves of monsters with a boss at the end) but the levels are large and well designed. Strategy consists of finding a holdout spot with fallbacks (if possible) and channeling the zombies into your killzone. Public games actually work well too. This game is very different from Left 4 Dead 1&amp;2 in a good way. I highly recommend.",

Nope, they are mutated crazy people that there goal is to kill your crew that is supported up to 6 players on a normal server. Once you are in the game you start out with a pistol and a knife. After each round you go to a shop that sells and takes weapons. Your currency is what buys you these things you need to survive. Your currency is in pounds instead of dollars for you American players like myself. The enemies get harder every round. At the end of round 10 you have to fight a boss that at times can be very frustrating but with a team can be vaporized. The only complaint I have is that some servers have insanley hard enemies when it says normal, thankfully these servers are scarce and are not very hard to avoid. Overall I give this game a 9/10 this game that may be similar to left 4 dead is a good coop game that deserves our attention as well as its sequeal coming up who knows when.",

If you're looking for a good all-around zombie-killing game, definitely take a pause to check this game out. It's filled with all the basics, including flamethrowers, pistols, sniper weapons, explosives, rockets...and if you're like me, you'll definitely appreciate the added medic-gun, which provides basic self-defense and a team-healing alternative fire. Killing Floor does not boast the best graphics, and lacks a real story...but it was intended to be a game one can just jump right into, and when you take into account the active fanbase, it leaves very little room to be disappointed. So if you're in favor or at least impartial to mindless zombie torture, give this game a shot...HEADSHOT! Haha!",

            "review_text": "This is a really fun addictive game. it's basic focus is playing with friends, although playing with yourself is just as fun. but instead of me blabbering on about how i love it, here are the facts   The Good:  -very fun to play with friends, especially the way killing floor encourages teamwork through borrowing money and better healing on teammates  -the perk progression system acts like a class system where if you do a certain thing or goal, your basic abilities are increased, thus making that class more deadly. possibly the best feature of this is that you do not have to be that class to level up. such as if your a commando and you get pistol headshots, you can still level up sharpshooter which does not limit your ability to upgrade and thus making you feel more freedom like.  -the variety of monsters is great, offering zoombies that are invisible, agile, angry, BLOATy and even some that have weapons, and most that have special and deadly abilities to take you and your team down.  -the map variety is great as well, offering some maps at day and night, some in different weather conditions, and some in bizarre areas like a moonbase and santas workshop. overall map variety is great, and is increased by Steam Workshop downloads that can give you extra maps from great creators.  -as i said the multiplayer is fun. but that is not all, the connection is also great regardless that this game was made in 2009, the servers still stand up to a total of 6 players which is astonishing. the most amount of Ping i recieved was 90.  -the character variety is also excellent. there are many to choose from, each has good detailing and have clever phrases which play out on your zombie killing debochery.  -the weapon variety and feel of them is excellent as well. between games like BF3 and CoD, this game surprisingly has a better and more realistic feel to them. having them shake your screen, a nice muzzle flash, and satisfying sound. the weapons are excellently designed, especially compared to big budget titles.  - the graphics, while not the best today, are very good. even if you do not have a gaming computer you will be able to play this game. with very minimum requirements, this game will run smooth on any pc, as long as it is not from 2005. hell, that might even work. while you can run easy on low and medium, the real quality is shown in high and very high. it is astonishing the amount of detail the textures can have in a game like this. not once did i experince texture pop ins during my playthrough, and if i did, i did not notice them. the only thing i can ask for in this department is a larger FoV. but who cares?    Now that we have all that awesomeness out of the way, time for some not so awesomeness that may make people hate killing floor, despite its great gameplay:  The Bad:  -the story is terrible. why? i never had it clearly explained to me. i had to go to wikipedia to find it out. although the story that wikipedia explains sounds very good, it merely serves as an excuse for killing floor to have zombies running rampant. personally i like the wikipedia explanation of the story and i am interested in the myhtos so it would have been cool to include a story mode to explain it a bit. talking about modes...  -so about the modes. first i think i should explain that, even though the perk system is a big and great part of the game, you cannot progress your perks with other modes other than the original mode... let that soak in a little bit. you can only progress your perks in the original mode that you play. if you want to set up a custom game in sandbox mode you cannot progress your perks. i personally love the sandbox mode which allows you to customize almost all game features, but without perk progression, you are less motivated to play sandbox mode for fear that all your progress will be for not. another thing that disables perk progression are Mutators. mutators are things that enable special rules such as only a certain type of enemy or no buying weapons, kind of like paintball mode in goldeneye. this was not a big issue for me, but may affect other people.   -another issue i have with the game is the character portraits. simply put they are terrible. they are low resolution, big, and usually come in a shade of grey and red. while the character models look good, just press portrait and you will see my issue.  -probably the biggest issue i have with this game is difficulty. so prepare for a long one. i will break it up into sections. here we go: 1)Difficulty settings: while the beginning difficulty is fine, Medium is way too hard. killing floor comes with varying difficulty levels. Beginning, Medium, Hard, Hell on Earth, and Suicidal. beginning is fine, normal average difficulty, nice pace. then you go to Medium and there is a huge difficulty spike. the enemies are harder, they come fster and more numerous. it was steps above what it should have been as i expected medium to be the difficulty any average joe shooter player could play on. the issue i have with hard is exactly the opposite. it is just like medium. infact, at times, i found hard easier than medium. the other difficulties are fine considering their scale. 2)enemy difficulty: so let me explain, there are many specimens, each with varied specialties. but there is one so overpowered it's not even funny. and that is the fleshpound. when you attack him, he rushes you and does massive damage. like, kill you in 3 hits damage. yea... now usually i do not have a problem with this, in fact i encourage a good challenge to test my strength in gameplay such as the Big Daddy in bioshock. the issue i have is that if the fleshpound is so hard, then why are the rest so easy? you have your average one hit kill enemies such as crawlers and clots, but then you have husks which shoot rocket launchers, scrakes which chase you with a chainsaw, and sirens which blur your visions with screams. the three i consider to be heavy hitters are the husk, scrake, and fleshpound while the sirens are more like supporters of them. but the husk and scrake are nowhere as hard as the fleshpound. the scrake is more appropriate so i guess my gripe is with the husk. yes he has a launcher but why so weak? his launcher would encourage you to snipe him, but with his health you could use one katana swipe. also a note considered, the Flesjpound has about 1/3 of the health of the patriarch (last wave boss), so that speaks essays about how powerful he can be. i do not think the fleshpound should be weakend, i think the other should be strengthened.  -now to my last point, and that is with weapons. first of all, some weapons should not even be in the game. such as the m99 sniper rifle. sure its crazy powerful, the last sniper you can buy, but with a price of $3000 its hard to get especially considering that EACH BULLET IS $500! yes, you heard that right. making this rifle worthless on anything but beginning difficulty. one more thing is unlockable weapons as well. the Dwarfs?! Axe can be unlocked by playing the dwarfs free2play game a bit and get gold which i did and that was fine. my issue is with the ZED gun. now a while ago, there was an event where you could collect parts of this gun which is no longer available making the weapon being there pointless beyond the update! i searched and scrounged only to realize i would have to downgrade my game to get the gun. its not a big issue though.   so now you can gather your opinion about the game from my statements and hopefully others. watch some gameplays and see how the game works. it released in 2009, so its pretty damn good for a game back then, and even now. personally you should not think about buying it, and if you are get it now. at a full retail price, it is totally worth it. or you can save your money for the confirmed killing floor 2. but enough with rumors. overall i give this game, considering it released in 2009, a 8.5/10. it is a must buy.",

You go through waves (from four to ten) then at the end you fight a boss.  There are perks you can get but unlike other games, perks serve more as a role than a buff. For example, the berserker is great with melee weapons and damage resistance but if you want to blow something up you will get a better 'boom' with the demolition perk.

The gunplay is pretty satisfying, with very nice limb dismemberment and headshots. Theres an active effect called 'ZED TIME' when the game thinks you did something cool, for example, a single bullet penetrating threw 3 or 4 heads. When 'ZED TIME' kicks in, everything gets slow-motion, and you have extream accurecy with very little threat, (Your aimer moves quickly but the zombies do not.) Its got a very tacticle feel to it, Where you get money for each wave of zombies you survive. Then the traded opens for a few moments, you can restock on armor, gernades, ammo and of corse, firearms. There is also a perk system, where doing certian tasks level your selected perk. They provide some decent class bonuses, most consisting of discounts to your specific wepond class when you buy from the trader. There is a great varity of weponds as well. Ranging from the Katana to rocket launchers and everything in-between. HOWEVER, A HUGE NEGETIVE FOR ME IS TRIPWIRE WANTS YOU TO SHELL OUT REAL CASH TO BUY WEPOND PACKS. They are nothing amazing, but if they arent anything great, why make us pay? Bad tripwire. But like i said before, the mods keep me into it, and also keep everything fresh. I personaly love the 'Gun Game' mod, pretty much modled after Call Of Duty's game type. Theres also DM, TDM, and DM Extreame, which is a deathmatch with random zombies in the mix. Theres also some other modes, but another thing that keeps this game fresh is events. Holiday or whatever, but they add new things, new unlockable characters, and reskins to all the zombies. But all in all, this game is a deffinte hit for me, and at its price point, its worth a shot to anyone intrested for sure.",

            "review_text": "Killing Floor is one of those zombie FPS's that you have to play, just to get a feel for what's out there, personally, I love it.  By far, the best feature of the game is the weapons. Beautiful. To use, to hear, to feel, to watch... Great models, nice variety, plus many more of them via the Steam Workshop, plus skins.  The enemies are relatively samey, but there is a large selection of maps, which are quite varied, but there are community made maps incase you run out.  Things have been tweaked to make things better, like the shop, it now arranges the weapons by your chosen class by default, so you actually buy the guns for your class which you will have perks for which some noobs didn't.  The leveling system is different, you can basically farm levels to give yourself a slight advantage if you want, but I much prefer being able to say; 'Purely got here from playing normal matches, no farming, all sweat, tears, pain and work.'  I'm mostly a medic, and working as a team, being pro, feels really satisfying in this game. The frequent slow-mo 'Zed Time' is sweet too. Also exploding heads is awesome.  The storyline (if you can call it that) thing is meh, personally I don't think it needed it, I see it as more of a 'there's a zombie apocalypse, get over it, lets kill some zombies!'  The voice acting in the game is probably a bit of a Marmite situation. Most of the characters voices are British, everyone is kind of Baldrick from Blackadder, with bizarre phrases like 'TWO BLOODY GREAT HANDFULS' when you dual wield pistols (which incidentally, you can aim down sights with, which is a nice feature, I love 'akimboing' as they call it in CoD - bleh) The trader is some generic flirty tomboy which mostly gets on my nerves more than anything, with her odd phrases like 'Not enough money for that one babe...' - 'Shop is open boys, come get me... ;) xoxoxooxoxoxxoxxoxxoo'. Not very zombie apocalypse, a bit ♥♥♥♥-takey. I like the sort of exaggerated British voice acting, but the lines they say are a bit on the lame side.  What I would change, in a sequel maybe, is probably add a few more types of enemy, just for the hell of it, possibly some more game modes (Like I love the whole L4D2 being a zombie thing, that's awesome), and make some of the maps and textures a bit brighter, and make the whole UI a bit more 2014 instead of 2005, but that's not a massive deal really. To top it off incredibly high res textures and some destruction physics like destructible maps, whop PhysX in there with that too and we've got probably the best zombie FPS ever made. Also add some music.  However, where it currently stands, I award it 91/100 or 4.5 stars / 5.  If they make a KF2 with all my changes, I would buy it. Full price. Pre-order.",

Also other kinds of less gun-ish weapons like flamethrowers and swords and explosions. You'd expect the old zombie survival shtick to wear thin after a while, but somehow there's always just enough variety to keep it fun and engaging. Admittedly I was not sold on the game at first, but it gets better as you get more involved. Does have some bugs which are rarely fixed in an expedient fashion.

            "review_text": "DOSH! Grab it while you can, lads.  Okay, bad way to start off a recommendation, but whatever. If you haven't played this game yet, it's essentially a game dedicated entirely to Horde Mode. Fight waves upon waves of different types of specimen (stop calling them zombies, if you have been calling them zombies), until you come across the almighty 'father' of these creatures, the Patriarch. Rinse and repeat on another map.  What helps make each match different would be how everyone else plays, as there are multiple perks (classes) to choose from in the game. The more you play as these perks, the better the stats for those perks become. But be prepared to do a lot of grinding to even level up. It's not so bad in the early levels, but as you rank higher, it requires more to get to the next level. The best way to explain that is with this example: You're a level 3 Commando, and you just inflicted a total amount of 1.5 million damage with assault rifles. Congrats, but you haven't killed 2000? Stalkers, so you don't get to rank up until you kill more Stalkers. If you play the game casually like I do, it's going to feel like forever until you get into the higher levels, as a head's up. I'll let you be the judge on whether or not that kind of leveling system is good or not.  If you haven't heard yet, this game is famous (or imfamous) for its dialogue. It's so bad, but in a good way. Think of it as like a cheesy B-movie of sorts. Considering that this is an independent game and has the feeling of a B-movie anyways, I think this is okay. Even I come back to quoting some stuff, from time to time.  One thing I especially need to mention is that this game is heavily supported by the community, in terms of custom maps, mods, and even dedicated servers. Don't believe me? Check out the Steam Workshop for this game, and you'll see how big the community's support for the game is.  Oh yeah, did I mention this game is essentially Horde Mode? Yep, only game mode, so if you're not a fan of it, don't play this game. However, if you're alright with it, I recommend playing this game with friends. This game is meant to be for a group of six people, so you know what to do. Also, this game does tend to go on sale a lot for cheap, so to be honest, I would wait until a sale pops up before buying the game.",

Recently updated yet again over a year and a half after release, this game is second only to TF2 in terms of official updates. With 132 achievements and perks that take awhile to level up, there's always plenty to do here. And people actually co-operate when you play on the harder difficulties (usually)!  Long story short, if you enjoyed Nazi Zombies this will suck away so much of your time. Totally worth the price of admission.",

I've never been a fan of these types of 'tower defence' games.I consider this one because of the fact that monster come at you at waves and to win you must wipe them out,etc. However,this game made me rethink about my opinion about them.Perhaps it's too damn well made!Or perhaps I just find it FUN to use a crossbow and double-big-♥♥♥-pistols to splatter the brains of a horde of 50 zombies coming at me. The catch, however is - if you make a mistake ( allow one of the weakest, but most annoying buggers in the game to grab you ) , you die.Except if you have the right perks,which I will now explain. Perks define your weapons and bonuses.Technically they are classes.There is a pyro,grenadier,sharpshooter (technically made to one shot most zombies using headshots),commando which is kinda heavy weapons,medic and support specialist.Best thing is - you can always switch them!To level a perk requires one or more feats. (Example : To level up a medic you must heal N points.To level up a sharpshooter you must do N headshots.Each perk or class has its own unique feats and weapons.) You have to wait a round, however, and you can change perks once per round,during the shopping time.Shopping time is the time between rounds,lasts a minute and there's a predefined spot on the map,the location of which is shown by an arrow in the top left corner of the screen, and a red sort-of misty-light that show you the way after the round has ended.One in the shop, you heal automatically, restock on ammo, get new weapons and if you want to, switch perks. Depending on the size of your team, the difficulty level and the match length, the zombie numbers range from 20 to 70,in a 10 match duration in Normal solo mode,where you can hone your skills,and 50 to 200 if you have 5 or more teammates, this time in Normal Multiplayer. Difficulty level is what it should be - measures the damage,health and general smarts of the zombies. Moving onto the zombies, there are 12 or so kinds of them, ranging from small black spider-like zombies to the Boss, the Patriarch,who has a minigun, rocket launcher, claws, invisibility and when he's close to death, he has 3 health syringes which heal him.He uses 1 syringe per heal. All in all,there are minor bugs that aren't even close to serious, and are mildly annoying.The game is extremely fun to play, especially with friends.It's also set in Britain so expect lots of British slang. Now hurry up, you lot, and buy this bloody game while it's on sale!",

Nothing is ever certain in this game and an easy run can just as easily turn into a bloody mess out of a horror movie. If you're just starting out, trust me - you don't want to get caught. The maps are quite difficult to finish for unexperienced players and total annihilation is not that uncommon. It definitely pays off to level up the classes because when things get tough, class perks might just save your life. Some people get annoyed by the occasional slow-mo time that is triggered for all players ingame, but it never bothered me. Running around dressed as a giant zombie-killing chicken with a crossbow is just too much fun.",

The music is very intense and surprisingly fitting to the game itself. Art style is a little old now, considering the game itself is a little old now. However it is perfectly fine for what the game is. Mechanics are old, the engine is old, the game is old, old old old. YES it's old, but good! mm back to mechanics, yes they are old, yet it is extremely satisfying to blow mutants heads off, or chop their limbs off in slow-mo. Over-all it is a great game to play with your buddies. I would recommend it to anyone who likes gore, and killing lots of things in short amounts of time.  Still, get it on sale.   -Personal Experience-  I had just gotten out of playing L4D2 for a while and I was in the mood for another zombie-like shoot em up. So naturally when my friend Michael suggested this game to me, I hopped on board very quickly. Not knowing what to do was half the fun, and exploring about the game, learning the different maps and different perks was an experience on its own. For the first 20 or so hours I never even fought the boss, but when I did, man I was not ready.  When the first of the events started that was a real blast and every event after that was something nice to come back to and try to complete. Now however I'm running out of custom maps to play and events to do. The workshop addition is nice, organized way of offering skins and maps, but I am definitely more excited for the release of Killing Floor 2.  This game has grown more of a classic to me now, after so many hours of playing, I occasionally go back to play it, and it never disappoints. All I hope is that Killing Floor 2 will be better than this game, from what I've seen it looks like it will be the same stuff over again, with updated mechanics and (slightly) upgraded graphics. In which case, I will not be playing it.   **= Old Review =**  This game is siiiick, grab a buddy (maybe a beer) and shoot some zombie ♥♥♥. Not the complete best graphic/movement wise, but this game is a MUST GET. Remember its boring alone, get a friend to play too!  Kick ♥♥♥ game, 4.5 Stars!",

Every player has access to every perk and weapon, with certain perks providing boosts to specific weapon types, such as the Berserker perk boosting melee weapons and the Sharpshooter perk boosting sniper rifles and pistols. The weapons available for purchase are also not limited to what perk you are using and as such players are allowed to mix around their perks and weapons to be used against the waves of ZEDs, allowing player customization.  Even with the age of this game, Tripwire has provided great support for this game and has released a lot of DLCs and holiday themed maps for players to mess around with. If that's not enough, there is also the Steam Workshop, where players can download custom weapons and maps to play with.  Overall this game is just wonderful and it is worth every cent.

If you don't think about the depth and deep thought put into the game, sure, it is a normal zombie game. You shoot, get weapons, and shoot more stuff. This isn't Killing Floor. So first thing that makes it different from others is the vast array of weapons and items. First of all, there are multiple classes for all weapons. They could also mix classes and weapons. So lets say, you enjoy explosives, but you like the commando's ability. So you could be a commando and use pipe bombs(Just large explosives that deal alot of damage). The second is the amount of maps. Call of Duty Black Ops 2, a popular, widely-known game, has a zombie mode with 3 small maps. Killing Floor has (without any Steam workshop downloads) has ~27 maps. A plus side is, they are enormous. You can play multiplayer with your friend and stick by their side, next thing you know, you guys are completely seprerated and have no clue to each others locations. The thrid and final reason why this game stands out and is fantastic is the different zombies. There is a zombie called a stalker which is invisable until it hits you. A crawler which goes fast, and crawls making it hurt. In conclusion, This game isn't 'Terrible' nor 'Average' or even 'good'. In the end, if you think about everything put into it, Killing Floor is 'extraordinary'. Thank you for your time.",

When going solo the atmosphere starts to kick in, making the game feel alive and more importantly, you no longer have jackasses with their terrible voice shouting out 'New mag lads.'

I mean, what is there that is better than decapitating zombie-like monsters with a crappy pistol that lasts you all the way until the End-of-Match boss?  Nothing. That's what.  The game is great. With pubs being able to work effectively in a team without even communicating and just sensing when someone is in trouble. I mean, of course you need to give them a hint every now and then, but most of the time it's like Spidey Sense. They just know. And so do you. Like magic...  Combat is fun but can get repetetive after a while and because of that I might recommend some people to take breaks from this game. After all it is just shooting things, blowing things up and slicing things. It can get boring after a little while, but not so boring that it would make you want to get a refund.  The game runs pretty well on an Nvidia GTX 560ti which is pretty outdated (but heck, I can run The Witcher 3 on high setting with this) but it can run well on max settings due to the game also being outdated.  Community is great with a massive variety of custom maps and mods for those maps that offer a large variety of gameplay. People often play on those servers but quite a few also play on standard ones too as loading into the custom servers can take a big chunk of time due to all of the custom textures and files and stuff.   TL;DR  Overall, this game is great for friends and strangers alike, although I think more people have flocked over to KF2,  however , there are still a lot of people playing this game for it's nostalgiac things.  Give it a play. It's great fun.",
