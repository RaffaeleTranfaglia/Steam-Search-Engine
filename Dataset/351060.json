I played like 50 minutes and didn´t even finish act 1 because I got stuck the second time. Later, i watched a gameplay- video on youtube, only to realize: there is nothing more to this game. It literally ends after act 1.  Act 2 is called a 'free dlc' coming in winter.  This is when i uninstalled the game and asked for a refund. Usually it costs 10€, but even the 5€ i paid on wintersale are to much for an unfinished game with this little content. ",
