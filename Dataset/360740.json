Downwell for the PC is the game in its full, worth-trying-to-complete glory. The mechanics are ingenious, though the enemy design is lacking. Several critics called it their favorite of 2015, so I would recommend it for the $3.",

The idea of only being able to shoot down while falling mechanic is different when it comes to a rogue-like of game, it is an easy concept to grasp but tricky to master. There being many unlocks like screen filters and several character types really gives it some replayability. I find the game delivers for its price point and is a must pick up if you're into rogue-like games and 2D shooters.   Pros: Game is affordable and have replayability with achievements and unlocks.   Cons: Some pickups are super OP while another will insure a swift GG. Some enemies tend to swarm you in a goldilock zone where you are not able to dodge no matter what and must take damage, mostly getting cornered in doorways. Some combinations of upgrades can sometimes cause you to free fall in a situation where it is not called for due to chain reactions occurring in unison.   In conclusion I give the game a 8/10, you get a lot of fun for the price ;).",

The controls are simple, move, jump, and shoot. Where it gets more complex is the power-ups. You get gun upgrades as you travel down the well and power-ups at the end of each stage. Stages gradually get more dificult and add more elements the further you go down. I've only reached the third area so far but everytime I die it gives me more of a push to see if I can do better. The more you play the more you can unlock too, different game shaders, as well as different styles you can use to fight baddies. Overall, pretty happy with this one.",

TL;DR version: -Tons of nifty nostalgic unlocks. -Great dedication to the theme of an arcade quarter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ / handheld platformer from the late 80's/early 90's. -Extremely fast and rewarding gameplay. -Lots of character in a little package. -Super addictive (Also the word 'M U N C H E R' is censored by steam?! 0.o Wut?)  Downwell is as the description calls it: 'A curious game'. Taking Rogue-like elements and mashing them into a precision, skill based 'platformer' is a really neat idea. One of which results in very addictive gameplay.  In the vain of Super House of Dead Ninja's; the game is given to you in bite sized chunks. Testing you in on-the-fly problem solving through its very fast bouncing mechanic. Which is extremely rewarding. Granting the player bonus gems ( currency/points ), health boosts and just an awesome feeling of accomplishment. I won't bother going to far into to detail as the game is fairly self explanatory based on the trailer video within the store front. I will say that while very easy to pick up, it is an extremely skill based and deep game. One that offers a very nice skill curve that I myself am still exploring.  Much like S.H.o.D.N/ Luftrausers; the game is brimming with highly addictive replayablity for arcade and rogue-like junkies. Also: It's ♥♥♥♥ing $2.99.

You can stomp on certain enemies to kill them (like Goombas). You also have a gun which shoots bullet below you, stopping your fall and letting you get your bearings.  I bought this for 1.99 and have certainly gotten my money's worth. At 2.99, it's kind of an iffy buy, as most people I assume will play just a few hours of it. It's certainly difficult (not Super Hexagon difficult) though and you will probably take awhile to beat all four stages of the game (I've got about 10 hours or so on my game and I've yet to win the game.)

            "review_text": "You really can't go wrong when the User Review Rating is Overwhelmingly Positive.  You also can't go wrong with a Devolver title.  Like everyone else has said here, Downwell is a very solid, easy to pick up, hard to put down, impossible to survive 8bit action platform shooter.  Easiest way to describe it is your little 8 bit dude is falling down a well filled with enemies. You only have two controls: jump and shoot, all controlled with the same button, so you'll either be using the directional pad of your controller, jumping, or shooting. When you shoot, your fall is slowed down until you run out of ammo, but your dude will reload after you either land on a rock or platform or stomp an enemy. You'll also collect gems as you destroy rocks and kill enemies, and you can use these gems in shops on the way down to get better gun upgrades or refill your HP. Each level concludes with you reaching the water at the bottom of the well. The wells get deeper and take longer to complete the higher levels you reach.  It's a rogue-like, so you'll keep playing and progressing until you die, then it's back to level 1. It will take your gems and give you a progress bar. Once it's filled, you'll unlock different colors for your screen as well as styles of play.   You'll die a lot when you first start because you'll think you have the game figured out and you so don't. You're not just falling and shooting stuff. There IS strategy involved, it's not just dumb luck.  My suggestions are these: TAKE YOUR TIME. It's not a race to the bottom. You want to stay alive as much as possible. Also, know your enemies. Some of them you HAVE to shoot in order to kill and others can be stomped on the head. Those little dudes scaling the sides of the walls with the spikey backs..SHOOT THEM. Those birds can be a nuisance too, so blow them away when you get the chance and don't linger because they will chase you and take a nice bite out of your HP.  Know your guns. Not every gun is as effective. While some are really powerful, they have a very short 'magazine', so if you're spamming it all the way down, you'll be empty more times than not. My personal favorites so far are Burst (B), Shotgun (S), Fist (F), and Machine Gun (M). Laser (L) is my least favorite.  Pick your post-level upgrades wisely. You can drastically change your survivability by choosing the right one. Giving yourself extra HP is fine, but not if you're not doing as much damage as you could. You'll just take slightly longer to die. The Droid is a great upgrade for clearing rocks and enemies as you fall. I usually grab that and couple it with Triple (T). I also like the upgrade that reloads your gun as you collect gems. The less I have to think about reloading the better. I'm trying to get to the bottom of the well with as much HP left as possible. The right combo of gun and upgrade can make all the difference.   Don't try to kill every enemy. Remember, your goal is to stay alive, collect gems, and reach the end of the level, not clear the well of all enemies. Some enemies you will seriously need to ignore and keep moving down. If they get persistent, THEN dispatch them, but you're gonna gain gems regardless, so don't waste time trying to kill everything, lest you put yourself at risk of dying early. You can fall faster than they can chase you, so destroy what's in your way and bypass what is not.  Have fun! This is another great game from Devolver!  9/10 ",

The game conceptually plays like the offspring of Super House of Dead Ninjas and Luftrausers; a game about fluidity, speed, reflexes and screenshake. Lots of screen shake.  Your goal is to perpetually move downwards, through a procedurally generated well, killing or avoiding enemies, collecting gems and weapon upgrades, before making it to the end of the stage. At the end of each stage, you are rewarded with a choice of perks/abilities; think Nuclear Throne.  The main joy in this game comes from the superbly fluid controls, allowing for instinctive, twitch platforming. All good platformers are defined by their movement mechanics, and this game has really nailed it. Couple this with the game's brilliantly nostalgic art style and soundtrack, and you have a real indie gem.  Downwell may not be everyones cup of tea, but for fans of the genre, this is an amazing game, at a steal of a price.",

Only downside is that there are some pretty unexplained mechanics in here that I had to kind of look up myself. Example being, getting a combo of 25 + will heal you 1 and increase your charge by 1 so it's better to just end your combo at 25 for the most part. Also when you're at max HP, if you get a healing item it fills up another smaller bar beneath it and if you do it 4 times it increases your max HP.   Other than that, it's very worth it at the price.

Also, the levels are procedurally generated so of course you will see the layout of the level of bricks, powerups, and enemies placed at random parts of the well when playing through each level. So far the game has a nice replay value if you did include the randomization of level generation and highscore leaderboards.  The price is a downright steal for such a unique arcade game and this being a debut of 23-year-old Ojiro Fumoto is a rather impressive game for such an awesome price. I beg of you dev if you can improve this awesome formula you have concocted I would pay you a significant amount of money. If any of you have not picked it up yet I suggest you do so now.

No, if u even slightly touch the SIDE of the mob you will get hurt also the underbelly but thats understandable. and you only have 4 hp ( can be up'd by upgrades ) so unless you're used to unfair gameplay and fast-paced games you WILL have a hard time getting to floor 3-5 and don't get me started on the complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t this games throws at you during the new floors. like ♥♥♥♥ING SPIKE FLOORS!!!.

The character movement is nice but i feel like the game is half in control by putting monsters right next to you and the rate at which you fall is barely controlable with limited hover. some old dude can offer you pointless upgrades like rice balls that recover hp and whatnot that can help but not by much.

The idea behind the game is simple, you jump down a well and attempt to fall to the bottom of it using your gun boots to kill and stomp enemies as you fall. You pick up currency you can spend on consumable items and power ups at shops. When you finish a level you gain a power up, similar to what happens when you finish a level in nuclear throne. All the levels are procedurally generated and each world has its own enemies and nuances. Games start fast, go fast, and end fast with a few unlocks as part of a overarching reward scheme. So, it's kind of like a rogue-like where you fall down and see how far down you can go.  Finding bad things to say about the game is hard, the controls are as tight as a NES era console game, there's a jump button, a shoot button, and you can go left or right as you fall. I'd recommend a controller to play. Your gun boots reload as you hit some floor or solid object. The power ups are meaningful and change the way you approach encounters as you fall down the well. The graphical design is old, Atari old, the color consists of a black-color grayscale palate where you can change the 'color' as an option. It doesn't detract from the game and I feel the gameplay more than makes up for what you get, particularly as cheap as you can get this game for.  I really can not think of a sort of gamer who wouldn't enjoy this simple game. The mechanics are solid, it's cheap, the playthroughs are fast paced and fun, it appeals to casuals looking for a quick playthrough and hardcores looking to break the game. In short, it does everything a good game should do.",

You make your way down a spooky well filled with all sorts of creatures that I assume are trying to eat you in order to... reach the bottom. Heh. You could probably finish the game easy enough just by winging it but I feel like most of the fun and challenge lies in making those sicknastyhuge combos (I think my highest combo was around 215-ish).  Collect gems from enemies and safe rooms, then purchase health refills/expansions, or more weapon charges. If you collect a lot of gems quickly this also gets you a 'gem high' which significantly buffs your weaponry. Choose from about a dozen different perks each time you complete a level. Mix and match them for crazy bullet explodey times. It's all good.  On that note you've got a respectable amount of weapons to choose from, but you'll probably just stick to a few you feel most comfortable with (shotgun and puncher for me).  Finally, where the game falls short in length it makes up for in replayability, easily worth the price they're asking I think ($2.99 AUD, full price at the time of this review). With that said, I got all the achievements in about 2 hours so I'm pretty much done with it. Your own play times may vary.  Simple mechanics but solid gameplay. Short though. 5/10.",

However as you play you accumulate points and level up, giving new gameplay styles, palletes and more. The game is procedurally generated and you will definitely die a lot on your way to the bottom.
