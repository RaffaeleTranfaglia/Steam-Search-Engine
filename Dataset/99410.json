At one moment I thought there are some secrets... but, wait no, you get to pass the same locations multiple times so... Controls are ok but the camera angle..ufff...  Conclusion: You got it as a present or got it in a bundle good for you, you may aswell play it if you have some extra time, but don't expect anything good. otherwise I wouldn't pay more then 0.50$ for it.",

            "review_text": "I installed, finished and uninstalled this game already. This is basicly a 3D platform/hack'n'slash and the most terrible game i've ever played. There's not a single part of this game which isn't ♥♥♥♥ed up. The story, the characters (all 3 of them - 2 npc + you), the graphic, the controls, the camera handling, etc., even the puzzles cursed by the terrible controls, still the puzzles are the best parts of this game. If you wonder how hard is this game, it isn't. The most common cause of death will be falling from high places. I died dozens of times from falling while died only once during battle (if i dont count when i fell trough the floor in a battle once). And the most annoying part of all is the balance, because there isn't any, based on the steam counter it took me 2,5 hour to beat game, but from it only the final boss fight was more than half an hour. Because that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cheating as hell and i especially hate when developers use this kinda trick to extend the games length. I was so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ after a while, i started for looking cheats, unfortunately i didn't found any.  There are no options, so you can't do anything besides playing. Also you can't skip the end credits, so you're forced to watch every name whos are responsible for wasting 2-3 hour from you life. Also as a fun fact you can see how much people need to make a terrible game.  0/10",

If you die when it is near the ceiling, despite you have saved BEFORE moving it, you'll find yourself stuck since you can't jump on the platform which is far far away from you. What's the point of doing a GoW clone anyway? The guys from Santa Monica already squeezed the franchise, and they have all the technology and brilliant artists they may want to hire.",
