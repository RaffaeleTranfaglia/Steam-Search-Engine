            "review_text": "I don't leave reviews often, but I feel like I should for this particular title. I downloaded it because it had a positive user review. The user reviews are a large deciding factor on whether or not I purchase I game (I know, rather hypocritical because I don't leave reviews myself). I personally really enjoy VR and hope that it takes off which is why I am supporting the developers working on VR titles to show that there is a market. I do not want people to be put off by this demo because of the poor rating. Unfortunately every negative review I have seen has been posted by someone who does not own a Vive headset. They claim that the demo doesn't work or won't load even though it says on the store page that a VR headset is required. I personally can't see how anyone can so quickly go to negatively review something over technical issues that they obviously didn't attempt to troubleshoot. Any quick google search would let them know why this demo wasn't working for them.   Overall the demo is not perfect. The weapons are pretty uneven in power. The laser is extremely powerful with basically no negatives and it carried me rather effortlessly to the end of the demo. I barely passed the first wave when trying to use the mini-gun. Plus only one tracked controller is used meaning no dual wielding (not really to much of an issue because holding a mini-gun in each hand is a bit unrealistic). However there are a few different types of enemies, which most current Vive paid demos even lack.   The demo is short, it doesn't take very long to complete, and I probably won't be playing it again unless something new is added. But for a free alien shooter it is a fun experience the first time through. It's pretty cool shooting at giant scorpions and later seeing the roof open up and you end up having a boss battle with some type of ship. There is nothing here super amazing or incredible but it is still fun and would be a great game to demo to friends and family.   Admittedly I probably would not have downloaded this demo if it didn't have a positive overall rating and I would have missed out on a cool little shooter. For a free VR shooter game this shouldn't be passed up. I don't want people to overlook a fun free demo because of the negative/mixed rating. It definitely doesn't deserve that and only has that low of a rating because of people too lazy to do their research before leaving a negative review. Don't be fooled by the lower overall rating, because it should most certainly be positive.  ",
