This comes from the people who made Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game, which I loved and looks like it plays like Contra or Metal Slug, which I also love. Well, the graphics are very aesthetically pleasing in animation and both character and background designs. There are actually a lot of really cool looking enemies. The music is quite well done too. The problem is the gameplay. While watching videos it looks as if the game does everything right but the problem is: the game just isn't that fun. The game wants to be an old school run and gun but there's a lot of backtracking (which is even more annoying since the enemies respawn) and you have to reload every five or so seconds if you are run and gunning. The idea to put in a reload system was dumb but they way they did it (a time sensitive system) was actually kind of cool. Though it getting annoying fast. I found myself avoiding enemies so I didn't have to reload and then was wondering why I was still playing this game after avoiding the main game mechanic (shooting).",

That's not to say I don't enjoy the other games I play and adore, but this just tickles a fancy like none other. The rewards offered through progression, the challenges when the enemies ramp up, or when a new boss is introduced - they make playing endlessly entertaining. Now, much of the criticism the receives is due to a popular idea that the game is similar to Metal Slug. I've personally never played it, shame on me and such, but if you're looking for that experience, then you ought to play Metal Slug. This isn't like another game I've played, while it shares elements with many, it's an entity of its own. For many reasons this will remain one of my top picks for this year, if not longer, and there's no reason not to play it. Oh, get a controller.  April 10th revisions:  Oh... yeah... I'll have to recall some of those statements. The multiplayer is pretty much dying since launch, and the game isn't really that entertaining once you get your best gun. That being said, I got 60 hours of playtime out of it at its $15 launch price, so I'll definitely still recommend it. I just don't know how often I'll go back to it anymore. Whether I return to actively playing M.K. is really going to depend on how the Devs treat the game - as a product that could still use some improvements / additions, or as a finished game. Kinda feels melancholy leaving it behind for now...",

On that note I really did not enjoy the game and will be presenting the pros and cons in a list fashion.  Pros.    Amazing pixel art by Paul Robertson.    Lots of guns and gun combinations.    A very lenghty campaign.    Funny dialog.    Great music.   Cons.    Very tedious missions.    You have to grind missions over and over to get materials .    Bosses are bullet sponges and very unjustly so as a boss only has about 5-7 attacks each.    Areas in the late game are very tight and damages you for the slightest wrong move.    Most bonuses/ammo types requires you to grind making the game very lackluster and empty for people that don't like that.   Now althought this didn't really affect my enjoyment/disappointment with the game, the story was reminiscent of Cave Story down to an almost identical last boss.   All in all I probably would never replay this game again, as I did complete every mission the game offered.",

It scrolls sideways (and up an down too!) and you both run and gun in a very pleasant manner. Meanwhile your visual cortex is being stimulated by the gorgeously animated pixel art.   The one single negative thing I can think of is that you sometimes have to run back and forth across the level searching for whatever the mission objective happens to be. Hopefully this being the game's only fault in my mind will tell you something.",

I think the most common description of this game would be something along the lines of Metal Slug x Borderlands. Where the gameplay is obviously like Metal Slug but the be all end all is to upgrade your weapons, armor and mods through pickups. I think at most that's where this game kinda diverts from the two games mentioned and probably falls closer to the gathering games found in MInecraft or Terraria. There is no leveling method from what I've seen and the only way to increase your health and weaponry is by increasing your money by doing missions and picking up material drops found during those missions. At first, the game may seem difficult like most shooters will but once you get a decent upgrade going the game will start feeling like classic shooters from days past. I think what sold me on this game was when I was rolling with another player online (4 player co-op) and she was carrying around the spread gun. That's right a spread gun from Contra!",

Not many games have made use of the delicate pixel art that Metal Slug introduced us to. Why you might say? I think it’s because it requires a lot of work and the style has a lot of detail and could be daunting for the developers. However this game is just beautiful pixel art throughout the whole game, never getting repetitive or unfulfilling.  The game takes the shoot-em-up game, arcade style gameplay and mixes it with metoridvania free-roaming and item-gathering concepts to pimp up the Metal Slug-like gameplay to a more modernized version.   With hundreds of mission, carried out on several map levels, with endless of materials, gadgets, tech, armor and weapons to build and customize this game has shown us what the shoot-em-up genre will look like in the future. With all its content and lots of hard to catch achievements, this game will keep you coming back for more, for a very long time. I could not recommend this enough.

The gun customization is satisfying especially for a 2D side scroller experience. I recommend hooking up a controller and playing this one on your TV for a great old school gaming expereince.",

Like you cousin told you about the NES Metal Gear's plot, and you thought it would play like Contra. You also made it look cooler than it ever would on the NES. You made the perfect game a violent 11 year old would want to play in the 90's. Not one a violent 11 year old would make, but one they would play. This game is pretty polished, even though it has a little to much grinding. Also this game really is not like Metal Slug at all, it's like Contra. Sure the art style and sprites are similar, but the game play is more like Contra with slower (not slow) gameplay than Metal Slug. Also despite all the different levels, you will play the same levels with the same robots, and the same backgrounds over and over again. This makes the game loses a lot of its luster long before you can actually finish the game. Some of the ideas are interesting, the hunting, the upgrades to the guns, and the supporting characters. These all have flaws though. The hunting is repetative and gives few real rewards. The upgrades are confusing, with some bullets not working after you change one part of you gun. The supporting charaters are basically just fun one-liner machines, and while I like them they should have more lines, or somethings. Currently they just feel very repetative. That really is the main flaw of the game, how repetative it is. It should have had a few things cut, or more levels and enemies. It should provide hours of fun though.",

The game has amazing audio and the art style is great. I never say 'this music again' or 'that drone is so annoying'. The concept is nice but the story is meh. You go on missions with various objectives which sometimes can be unclear but don't give up. As you complete missions you advance on to new tiers that unlock new gun parts, knives, and progress you through the story. The best part is creating your own weapons. The wepon parts are divided into 6 parts, reciever, stock, barrel, magazine, sight, and ammo. Also there are different types of weapons like smgs, shotguns, snipers, magnums, and so on and so forth. You can mix and match or you can make a 100% shotgun to craft unique ammo only for shotguns. If you get 100% or over on a weapon type you can craft new ammo for it. And multiplayer too! There is 4 player co-op and it is a ton more fun with friends. Sometimes this game can get rather boring though, as many of the missions are rince and repeat but it keeps me going because I am always looking to improve my gear and unlocking new areas.

Things I didn't enjoy: wanting to build a particular gun, only to realize I need to craft it using materials I have to keep finding throughout the game. In that sense, the grinding gets pretty boring. However, the use of achievements (like speed running the levels) make the grinding arbitrarily less annoying.

Gameplay's pretty standard and fun without too much innovation in terms of controls and whatnot but what keeps it interesting is the customizable weapons. You completely customize your loadout with 6 different weapon parts at any given time that have different stats that affect how your character plays. Will you take a handgun with only 2 parts and be super fast and agile but with limited firepower? Will you take a huge minigun with tons of ammo that pierces walls and completely destroys things before it gets on screen with the side-effects of moving slower than a slug in molasses? The entire game revolves around finding loot to craft new weapons and mods that change how you play your character. It works extremely well because of the focus that it has on variety and uniqueness to each weapon. It's not perfectly balanced yet but it's still in development so it's not an issue. An excellent game that really gets the visceral fun of just raining bullets down pat.",

I'm only giving this a no cause I personally couldn't stand the grinding. Honestly, my biggest problem with this game is that some materials are just way too hard to get in any kind of significant quantities.

Retrieving items from your backpack is slow and also disrupts game play you should really be able to toggle through items with a single button click rather than having to hold down a button then navigating a menu and then select your item, you also have go through your backpack to get the walkie talkie out just to call someone so you can leave a mission so many clicks for such a simple thing.

Stuff like a barrel, magazine, stock, etc. You can have anything from a lightning sniper rifle to a fire submachine gun and everything in between, even being able to tweak how many bullets and your overall damage. You've got a knife that you can also have many different versions of. Useable items like first-aid kits, grenades, c4 to open some doors.  If you're a person who wants to get everything, buckle up. It's going to take you an awful long time to afford everything. Every mission is timed, which is a bit annoying at first.

You have your sub missions and main missions, you must complete all the main missions to unlock your boss mission, or in Monster Hunter your 'Urgent Quest,' to move on to your next rank or 'Hunter Rank.'   As for Megaman, the game's enemies and precise shooting mechanics are very similar to the Megaman franchise. So close infact some enemies have the same gameplay mechanics, examples are the Floor Spiders acting the like Springers, and Riot Shields acting like the Sniper Joes from Megaman.   Since Monster Hunter and Megaman are two of my favorite videogame franchises of all time, I love this game, but I understand how some people might go into this game expecting a Metal Slug type game.

Obviously there's numberous weapon upgrades and combinations, it's really interesting to mess around and tweak with those.

It's as if the developers have learned absolutely nothing from modern game design. This game is extremely frustrating, and most of it comes down to horrible design and core mechanics.   The biggest issue I have apart from the bad overall design, is that while the developers have tried to combine many different elements from successful games, the overall experience is worse off than any of those individual games it tries to imitate.Some gameplay choices don't play well with each other and their attempt at syncretizing these becomes detrimental to the overall experience,  I tried playing this game with multiple friends, and it's hard for me to insist on it when it's obvious no one is enjoying a single second of it.  A real shame, but the era for frustrating pieces of ♥♥♥♥ that you just love to hate are over.  However, if you're one of those people that is scourging through the reviews to find reassuring confirmation of why you'd love this game, and are desperate for the possible potential it might have I would in fact recommend this game. You might not play it for very long, but it does have an allure of enjoyment, one that it doesn't really deliver on, but afterall, like the developers, sometimes we like the idea of something over the actual thing itself.",

The soundtrack's combination of metal and chiptune-like tones calls to mind things like Virt's compositions for Contra 4 and DuckTales Remastered.  Once you get some momentum going, it's lots of fun crafting gun parts, bionic mods and even substitutes for your trusty knife, to put together your own personal loadout and see how it performs.  There's a couple hitches though. To me at least, the system of equipment weighing you down seems out of place, and the Monster Hunter-type layout of missions giving you different objectives in the same areas means it can get kind of repetitive, especially if there's a gun part or something you REALLY want to get the materials for.

While it does make sense with some enemies (running into a knife or an industrial drill is not a good health plan), this seems particularly silly considering the fact that most enemies do have an attack animation. - Critters count as enemies, meaning that touching a critter hurts your character as well. So yes, your mandrake-powered mercenaries can potentially be killed by a bunny. And there's not even a holy grenade to even the odds. - Speaking of old video game sins that should've been buried, ♥♥♥ soon as the enemy spawn point is off-screen, the enemy will respawn. It's like you've never been there at all! - Enemies with full frontal immunity; that is a full frontal I do not like. Whereas shielded enemies in Metal Slug would drop the shield if it took too much damage, the enemies in Mercenary Kings are pretty much invulnerable as long as the shield's up. So, as mentioned above, you can't just move past them and jumping over them is rarely an option too, meaning you'll have to wait until the expose their weak spot to attack them. And boy, they're not in a hurry to drop their defenses. - Weapons need to be reloaded. Because why slow down the game flow if it can be brought to a grinding stop instead? - No diagonal aiming. - No item quickslot. In order to use an item, you'll first have to equip it, then use it. This is not only annoying when you need to use an item quickly, it renders some items such as the riot shield useless, as it takes too long to use them. And on top of that, while you've equipped an item, you can't use your gun. - You can't buy a full stock of items, even if you can afford them. If I can carry 5 rations, why can I only buy 4?    The Ugly   - As all missions of a chapter take place in the same level, you'll see the same levels over and over again. - EVERY mission has a time limit, even gathering missions that require random loot from enemies. Why do I need a time limit when gathering materials to fix the tents? Do my oh so powerful mercenaries catch the sniffles if I don't gather them on time? - Do you like time limits? Then you'll love boss fights, 'cause those are timed too! As soon as the boss timer runs out, the boss will run away. Get this: the big guy's got a knife your size (it's literally as big as your character) and he runs away few minutes into the fight. And although the boss escapes through a huge cave, you can't follow him. No, you'll have to fight your way through the level again to continue fighting that big chicken. And of course, no backtracking experience would've been complete without a full enemy respawn! - Adding insult to injury, the boss timer starts running again as soon as the boss makes his appearance again. So, if you take to much time reaching the new boss area, the bugger's gone to another place. - Be on you guard when reaching a new boss area. The boss can attack you before you even entered the area.    Verdict    I really wanted to like this game, but the many, many flaws just kill it for me. Sigh. I should stop being a sucker for Paul Robertson's artwork. If you're looking for fast-paced run&amp;gun action like Metal Slug, don't buy this game. Go buy Metal Slug 3 instead. If you don''t mind the slower pace and the flaws mentioned above, you might want to take a look at it. Weapon crafting's good fun, and so's co-op run&amp;gun games.",

Gun customization is fun, and it controls and plays very well, sadly level and enemy design are not up to snuff to make it all come together.  The source inspiration for a title like this seems obvious to most players, but I don't know if the developers really got into what made those games work. The graphics are great, building guns is fun and shooting enemies is entertaining. The biggest complaint you'll see for Mercenary Kings is that it is too easy. And this is true. The enemies are placed in ways that make them easy to dispatch, and the ones that shoot don't do it enough to be threatening. It's rare to have even two projectiles on the screen at a time, let alone enemies. Even with that handicap on their part, your character can take multiple hits AND increase their health later on. Because of this, the most dangerous parts of the game are the very rare pitfalls that actually kill you. The game ramps up a bit towards the end, but considering how comotose the first five ranks are its just a little too late.  Now, I put this as not recommended but that's only because there is no 'on the fence' option. On one hand the game is entertaining enough and has an enjoyable art style, and on the other I can't lie and tell you this is a game you are going to remember. I would consider this a casual side-scroller, and honestly that isn't a game I would recommend. If you have no hands you may find this game challenging but this is something you play when an alternative would be to take a nap.",

            "review_text": "I'm going to try very hard to avoid saying 'this is like X meets Y' because those types of comparisons kind of annoy me. With that in mind, here goes:  This game is side-scrolling run-and-gun at its very finest. Tight controls meet challenging level design and enemies that aren't (always) simply mooks that charge at you full speed. There's a very interesting crafting system that allows you to mix and match weapon components (receiver, magazine, etc.) to make a gun to suit your desired method of mayhem. This same system also has in place 'implants' which confer bonuses (and disadvantages too!)  My favorite part of the game, however, is that it takes item weight into account. Weapon parts, implants, consumables you carry to battle,  everything  has weight and weight affects your movement speed. This creates an interesting strategic balance: do you bring the massive crush-everything loadout, sacrificing speed in the quest for power? Do you streamline to what you think you need and nothing else, trusting in agility and a quick trigger finger to win through? Or is your path to victory somewhere in the middle? This game doesn't judge, instead setting the options before you and letting you decide how best to assault its varying missions.  And oh, the missions! Not content with simple 'run to the right and kill it if it moves' gameplay, the game will present you with sections of a whole area that will become familiar over time, but ask different things of you each visit. Sometimes you'll be gathering items, other times it's search and destroy, still others your task is to seek out and rescue a captive (or more than one!) The variety of tasks you take on keeps the game from feeling repetitive, instead rewarding thorough exploration and familiarization with each map with secret passages and hidden treasures, not to mention helping to get quick times if (when) you go for speed-runs.  TL;DR = This game is a lot of awesome. If you like run-and-gun sidescrollers and you like customization, it's amazing.",

The majority of the enemies and bosses are fun to fight, and learning the sprawling level layouts is rewarding. After you beat the game speedrunning levels adds a lot of content and is thankfully pretty achievable, dependant more on knowing map layouts and enemy patterns than raw skill. The multiplayer is also really nice, but due to random matching you can get groups of folks who are very different skill/progress levels, which sometimes doesn't work out so well.  The gun crafting system is interesting and allows one to customize for their personal playstyle, but there are some combinations which are just better than most others and so are more widely used. Farming for materials shouldn't be much of an issue during the game, but the rarer end game achievements (craftsmanship, etc.) will definitely require a bit of farming. Default keyboard controls are pretty weird, but I got used to it and now it feels natural. Can be remapped if desired anyway.  Overall a really well made game, certainly worth a try.",

There are crafting materials to gather, people to rescue who can upgrade your stuff and even the reload mechanic is pretty interesting...  ...but then it starts to show that the next missions take place on the same map, using the same enemies on the same locations. Worse: since gathering missions sort of have you search the entire place, going back to that very same map for a different item isn't just not fun but downright tedious. I can but assume there actually ARE more than two maps, but it really doesn't look that way. The enemies respawn a bit too fast as well, btw. As in: way too fast. Then I haven't even talked about locations where you can find C4 to blow up a door which the game practically assumes you know by heart (which, to be fair, is actually the case, since you'll be backtracking so often).
