            "review_text": "This is a cute little angry birds clone.   Simple goal of destroying different colored wizards with a variety of war engines that you can upgrade as you progress. There are a fair number of levels, and when you first start you will be knock off the first dozen in just a few minutes.  Still, despite the simplicity there is a fair amount of polish. The artwork is simple but pleasing. The sound adds to the overall cute atmosphere. The game was a joy to play, if a little short.  If you like this type of game, this is a worthwhile title to try. 8/10",
