I enjoyed the first game a lot, and I was really excited with the idea of a second game.   Unfortunately, I can't recommend this title. It does have great ideas, and I love NWO references (like a reptillian creature, and that a pharmaceutical company is in leagues with Satan). In any case, I'd like to think that this is the Simon's Quest for the Lords of Shadow series. The gameplay is okay, but it has no idea what it wants to be. It wants to be a hack/slash adventure, yet it wants to be a platformer, and yet there are stealth sections which ultimately hurt the game. As a customer, I wanted the Castlevania that built on Lords of Shadow 1, not whatever this is currently.   The game falls VERY flat in the end. I was not satisfied with the story, despite the massively epic build up from E3. With that said, I don't recommend the game at full retail value. Maybe if it drops down to 30 or 20, I would say go ahead. As it stands, it truly is one of the weakest.   Pros:   Robert Carlyle as Dracula, other voices were great too.  Decent story   Cons:   Doesn't know what it wants to be, multi-vision project Too few enemies  Doesn't offer the excitement that LoS1 provided Flat ending Felt rushed   ",

            "review_text": "As a Castlevania fan (and I mean all of them), I recommend this game sincerely to fans of the series, gothic atmospheres, vampire and other mythical lore and fast-paced action games. I've played this game before on a different system, but I needed it again for the PC. That's how much I love it.  The negatives about this game often are about the stealth parts and the modern day sequences. I also find those less appealing, but it makes me appreciate the castle sequences even better. The environments are beautiful and open for exploration. Once you've got the majority of your abilities the exploration becomes the best part of the game, for me at least.   Some people say the story is so so, but I love the amount of effort they put in the lore. A lot of the story is hidden in the pages of the bestiary and abilities. Accompanied by amazing artwork and good music (though, earlier Castlevania's had better music), it makes it a atmospheric experience of storytelling.   My opinion might be influenced by my love for the series, but I can still recommend this game just for the amazing leveldesign, atmosphere, awesome bossbattles and rich mythological lore.",

            "review_text": "This game is an underrated gem. Not sure where the bad reviews are coming from. Most of the game takes place in an interconnected castle that will remind players of the metroidvania games. The combat is simple and satisfying and rewards variety and good timing. The boss battles are epic, and each one is unique and requires the player to learn a specific strategy. Sound design, music, graphics and presentation are all fantastic. Stealth sections provide a change of pace and though they are not as fun as the exploration and combat portions of the gameplay, they are few and far between. Happy I decided to pick this up despite the abysmal reviews.... If you are fan of the first Lords of Shadow then you absolutely must play this game. If you haven't played the Lords of Shadow series, definitely pick up the first as it is also a classic IMO. The series gets a lot of hate from Castlevania fanboys, and whilst it is definitely true that it deviates from many of the series tropes, I don't consider it a bad thing at all. A lot of care and devotion was poured into this series and it's a shame it has not gotten the positive reception that it deserves.   Bottom line is if you are a fan of 3d action/adventure games you need to play this game.",

            "review_text": "I got this for 10 bucks on the Humble Bundle store after having a lot of interest in it beforehand. Having played the original Castlevania, SOTN, Aria of Sorrow, and a portion of LOSMOF HD, I can say this game stands up to the general dark vibes. I was a bit hesitant of a 3D Castlevania game, but it worked quite well. Once I got used to the keyboard controls and whatnot, the game was not difficult at all, with the exception of a few very frustrating puzzles and a couple bosses.  It plays a lot like the older Devil May Cry games, including the 4th game in the series, even some of the camera zooms on doors and other things were very reminiscent of those games, which I loved.   The game promotes using different attack patterns, by using a 'mastery' system for each skill you buy with Souls. This system gives you points in whichever skill you are using, and when maxed out, can be used to upgrade the weapon itself. I found myself using more varied combos and different attack patterns, instead of just cheesing the bosses with Guillotine.   I digged how Dracula / Gabriel is portrayed, and the other characters are well done as well.   Though, be advised that the controls are not shown as keyboard keys, and will instead be like, 'push A' and so on, corresponding to an Xbox 360 controller. This got extremely frustrating in the beginning before I knew what the buttons translated to on the PC, but once I got used to it, everything worked well.   Is this game worth the $40 dollars? I am not sure really, it depends how much you want a game like this. I personally feel that the game is very good, and was well developed, even if by a different company than the original games",

            "review_text": "Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 is an action-adventure game, the sequel to the 2010 game Castlevania: Lords of Shadow, and the 34th installment in the Castlevania franchise (37th if one includes the 3 Pachislot games). The game was developed by MercurySteam and published by Konami. It was released late February 2014 in both North America and Europe and on March 2014 in Australia. A Japanese release was released on September 4, 2014. A downloadable chapter has also been released in March from the same year.  Gameplay As in the previous game, the player controls Gabriel Belmont, now known as Dracula, as he fights through an open world. During the game's opening sequence the player is able to control Dracula while he still possesses all his powers as well as all of his weapons. Dracula's main weapon is his Shadow Whip, a weapon that is comparable to the Combat Cross from the original Lords of Shadow. Replacing the magic system from the previous game are the Void Sword and the Chaos Claws. The Void Sword can replenish Dracula's health when used while the Chaos Claws can be used to break through enemy defenses and deliver powerful attacks. The story mode in Lords of Shadow 2 has been stated to be far longer than the previous one. The game is mainly an open world allowing the player to choose what route to take. Lords of Shadow 2 features a movable camera, something that was not available in its predecessor.  My opinion The game is fun, but it's optimized poorely. The controls with keyboard are pain in the ♥♥♥♥ and FPS drops make it even more worse and PLUS horrible stealth mechanic ruins most of the fun. I fixed of the problems by using Razer Onza controller. This game has a good plot which I don't want to spoil, but if you're unfamiliar with the previous game- don't worry, there's a short re-cap in the start of the game. The slasher elements make the gameplay live and interesting and the level up system doesn't award those who use only one combo, which makes you use different variations of attacks. The game is great for the money that are asked for it.  Would recommend to: *Fans of Slashers *Fans of Vampires *Fans of games with great story *Fans of lags/horrible controlls/bad stealth  Would not recommend to: *Old fans of Castlevania (Way before the first Lords of Shadow was released)",

            "review_text": "Castlevania LoS2 Is what I would define as bad oatmeal. Strong elements of several kinds without a smoot transition is what makes the experience feel forced, or what may force you to have harsh feelings about the game. (Like I did)  Merging strong storytelling with exploration using cutscenes is a big no in the experience category. When you find a new area or get past or to a boss or story area, you get a cutscene that either shows you everything you want to find on your own, or tells you a story that moves you from the area before you can finish exploring. Other games manage this type of merge by using character narration or slowing the walk speed.   Strong combat elements with excessive backtracking: Having to down half a dozen enemies who are tiered to what part of the main story you are on just because you are looking for something is what I hate most about the game. The lack of loot and a equipment system makes me lose the edge for excessive combat, but in addition to that, almost every enemy has a ranged attack that has huge hitboxes that they are all too happy to use deciding you would like to skip the battle. Most battles near the endgame or after you gained a new traversal ability are begun with a groan because you've been shot off a ledge to the point where you do want to fight just so you can enjoy the game. The mastery system ends way too early to entice excessive battling and credits are easy to get provided you dpend them properly upgrading skills you'll most likely use.   The open world element is trashed by an isolated map system and the same looking load elevators and hatches. Find things in this game is met with repeatedly going the wrong way and passing points where you cannot backtrack through the area after you jumped down. The areas are intertwined somewhat and only one or two pllaces have this problem, but that tied with the block the area rests in being behind one of like 5 blue elevator doors makes the experience irritating and repetitive.  But after you swallow those strong flavors and seperate them by improvising, you can stop to appreaciate the art and fluidity of the combat and the thought they put into hiding the upgrades. And then when all that is getting good... The game is over. It's metroid all over again. Get the screw attack, Find stuff, kill the last guy. I just hope there is a secret boss or something.   The alucard dlc is honestly why I bought the game. For some reason, everything dracula backwards is in seems to get more polish than the game itself... for some reason, that's still true. Alucard has proper last gen hair animation, a shiny coat, skin that is also pale but not sickening to look at, skills that are practical, a sword and movelist that probably drove the fans crazy, and one of the coolest ideas for a puzzle element ever. It doesn't break pace ever, and it makes you feel like you're a strong character. Instead of being dracula where you never even got to beat one of the guards that caused you so much trouble without taking over their body and dropping their gun.   It's one of those games that gets better when you play it. The start is slow, and the search is tedius, but after you play through it, you realize it is really a fantastic idea made into a just okay game. Where in my opinion, Lament of innocence probably takes the cake for a castlevania game, and alucard still takes the cake for the coolest vampire. Dracula should have stayed dead... Could have been a way better game.",

The story is complete nonsense, all I managed to gather was that you are dracula and you must stop Satan because of reasons. They pretty much removed all the clever platforming and normal puzzles that the first lords of shadow had. There is a new pointless stealth system that was poorly executed. While there are some improvements over its predeccessor, the bad far outweighs the good, don't waste your money. You're better off purchasing Dark Souls or Dark Souls 2.",

Even with some skills very likely when we played as Gabriel Belmont (in Lords of Shadow); play as Dracula is a totally new and excited world. Using his Void Sword, Shadow Whip and Chaos Claws to create powerful combos you'll become invencible, and in this point I have a negative opinion to say: I'm not sure if is because I played the first game and know how the combat system works, but I felt the game much easier, even when I was playing in Prince of Darkness difficult (except fora some Kleidos Challenges - they made a great work in those challenges). They made a open world game this time and they made great in my opinion. Was amazing when I started to play and everything was... normal  and as long I kept playing I could see the world changing around me. The fights, and in this point I have to say, they improved A LOT from the first game. Each weapon (Sword, Whip and Claws) has a different movement's tree and I just loved to use all: freezing smallers enemies and throwing them in the air with my Sword, breaking some shields and armors with my Chaos Storm and finishing them with my Whip was simply awesome, after all he's now Dracul and not just a simple human. Whitout no doubt a great game, not as much as the first one, but a great game. BUT like any game, this one has negative points too. Let's talk about bosses and enemies first. We play as Dracula, but there isn't much fights to enjoy all our powers, and should have more since is an open world game AND (yes, I know we play in present days), but I felt a bit out of context when I needed to fight against Mech (like robots) and enemies with guns (WTF face that moment), like Dracul just dropped of in another world. And I didn't see those epics bosses fights as I saw when I played the first game. The  bosses  in my opinion were just normal enemies a bit bigger (except for four: SPOILER WARNING   the fights against the two first acolytes, Zobek and Satan  ). You won't see an epic Titan or a dangerous Lord or some powerful Necromancer. Well, even with some negatives points and some troubles (I'm not sure if was 'cause my computer or the game só I decided do note talk about them), I still recommend to everyone to play this awesome and beautiful game.",

            "review_text": "The original text was published on Kanobu on 25.02.2014  I don’t know if a secret contest is taking place among the slasher game developers for the most over-the-top prologue*; but if there is one, then Lords of Shadow 2 is a shoe-in for the grand prize. First game of the series reboot by MercurySteam has greeted you with a slow gothic fantasy. This time the game gets right into the action. The protagonist is Dracula himself. He uses his own blood as a whip. His castle is under attack by an army of thousands. This army has a giant humanoid robot. The stakes are high, rivalries are thousands-of-years-old, prophecies are dark, and angels are fallen. And then there’s the usual removal of all those nice abilities which used to allow you to perform a complete massacre on poor grunts of the army which was attacking you.  The combat system looks exactly like the one of its predecessor: accentuated counter-attacks and two bars of special energy used to break blocks and heal. Both kinds of magic now have unique weapons, but controls are still the same. What stands out is a free-floating camera as opposed to static angles from the first game. A lot of delightful improvements to what already worked perfectly before aren’t the biggest surprise. The game looks back at the series’ legacy and remembers where the second part of metroidvania term came from. The world is a holistic labyrinth with inaccessible high passages and grates standing in your way. This promise of big and small secrets is the foundation for everything else here. The story progression path goes in big stretches only occasionally offering to come back to the earlier places. You could replay levels in the first game to access locked upgrades once you’ve acquired the required ability, but you also had to go through the repetition of story scenes and routes weren’t particularly interesting.  The second installment simply blends the secrets in the world as a part of a bigger picture. The scenery is grotesque most of the time and is occasionally filled with details for you to look at for some time. Half of the locations are in the future, of course, so it adds up to a final result of a truly bizarre over-stylized collage.  The wild outlook in accompanied by an equally wild script. It defies logic in favor of having more and more bizarre characters and spectacular action scenes. If there’s a fight on a moving train it’ll end with a crash, explosions and acrobatics. You can’t just kill the giant boss — you have to rip out its heart. It is completely normal for the protagonist to ride a giant gas bottle because he needed a new entrance in the building. The headcount of unlucky enemies of Dracula is in a thousands range. Relentless postmodern carnival wouldn’t give you a break, so at some point you just can’t be surprised by anything. Raisa Volkova, the daughter of Satan? Sounds completely normal!  Lords of Shadow 2 wants to go further than its predecessor so desperately and tries so much new stuff, that sometimes it ends with stuff that is just too cringeworthy. Clumsy stealth sections simply don’t hold up to the pace of the game and are irritating rather than entertaining.  Still, you get transformations into blood mist and rat pack out of this torture. Two more instruments for world-exploring toolset. You can see in it the reminiscence of what Symphony of the Night did to Rondo of Blood. The story of the series also goes in circles on the moebius band of time-travelling nonsense. The game may pass a self-parody for the long franchise with a few dozens of titles in it. And that may be a good thing sometimes.",

Parts of the game you have to sneak past guards because you're not strong enough to kill them. Which is complete bull crap because you're fighting Satan's acolytes who are super powerful demons. Basically the developers are forcing you to play a crappy game mechanic they thought was cool and justifing it by saying it's supported by the story. The more you play it the more it seems like an anime. Although the gameplay is different than Lords of Shadow you shouldn't play this one if you didn't like the story of the first.",

The bosses were a main attraction plus the world/landscape/art in the first one. Which i usually don't mind that stuff, but was a huge factor of why I bought this game. But in this one you lose all that except the art. You seem some cool landscape areas, but its all modern buildings now which are weird victorian scifi. At this point it just feels like a ♥♥♥♥ poor DMC copy. Until you go to Dracula's castle that is the only time the game feels normal and fun, but that is quickily ruined by when you meet your friends and they get corrupted and then you go to murder them. What is the point of being dracula if you don't get to experience the PERKS OF DRACULA. The fact you are a vampire plays no part in the game whats so ever. You never come across enemies that have vampire slaying weapons or anything. It's like they made the game and were like oh ♥♥♥♥ he's a vampire... well lets just make all the pickup/refills look vampirey...",

As for graphics, the game is beautiful - though not as inspired as the first episode. Light is improved, textures are improved, creativity not so much. Bear with the game for the first 2 hours and it won't let you down. Playing through modern cities with the almighty vampire might sound like a nice idea but the lack of better designs and the feeling of repetition as the scenery looks the same for a while will make you ask why the developers chose this path instead of focusing on the much nicer gothic landscapes Castlevania really shines on.  Storywise, even though the actors are awesome and doing their best, they haven't got much to work with. Still, this is only true if you compare it with the first LoS. Yes, there's a story, yes, it's kind of mediocre... Well, the majority of games I've been playing haven't been above mediocre so I guess it's fine.  Other than that, lots of places to explore and collectibles all over the place will give you replayability over the already lenghty main course. So, yeah. Good.

For a 1000 year old vampire that can rival gods power (see LoS1), he sure seems to be getting overpowered a lot. Why even do what they did, just assemble the couple hundred guards they have and rofl stomp everyone?  Boss fights have gotten less dramatic I feel as well, lightning chick and the Ring wannabees were much to simple for the expected ruckus they were supposed to bring.

However I did play the Original Lords of Shadow on XBOX 360 (I own the PC version but haven't played it yet.) And I really enjoyed the original LOS... didn't feel a lot like Castlevania because it lacked horror, but overall I thought it a well made and good game. It was like a mix of DarkSiders and God of War.  Lords of Shadow 2 did not stray too far away from the original LOS.   First I'll discuss what I didn't like. The Quick Time Events are pointless and I found they have an option in the menu to turn them off, but I didn't know until I beat it and was reading other reviews. It has tons of needless cut scenes... The camera pans away and shows you a switch, then pans back to you. It felt like I was losing the camera all the time... which reduced the imersion. The worst problem beyond QTE and passive hand holding camera scenes; was the awful stealth areas/instant redo spots. It just felt out of place for Dracula to sneak around some grunt... to go murder his all powerful boss.  The good? Well I had a great time playing it. The combat was fun and responsive for a melee beat em up. Tons of fun boss battles and the Normal melee 'elemental' style to weapon combat. Some of the levels were so pretty I had to stop and admire them. There are a lot of different types of monsters and plenty of things to collect/build up on experience.  I have no regrets from this purchase, it could have been better without needless cut scenes, QTE's, and stealth. But it did feel like a Castlevania and my fav boss fight was Dracula Vs. Death; totally worth it for me.",

            "review_text": "Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 is an entertaining, 12+ hour long action game with a few issues holding it back from greatness. It's a shlocky, hamfisted and (in my mind) enjoyable story focused on Dracula and his bloody escapades around his palace in two different timelines.   While not wholly divergent enough from the play-book of the first Lords of Shadow to call it a Metroidvania, Lords of Shadow 2 (LoS2) makes an admirable attempt at creating a fully explorable world which requires backtracking to old nooks with new moves in your arsenal to claim some doodad for your growing inventory of glowing crystal assistance-thingies. It's all very obvious and not particularly exciting, but it does reward you for your time and attentiveness.   You won't really need those 'hidden' rewards unless you're playing on the upper difficulty echelons. The combat is instantly recognizeable if you've played the first game. This year's model does come with improvements, weapon switching on the fly similar to DmC: Devil May Cry replaces the blue glow/red glow for essentially the same status effect, but with new combos to learn. There's also a fully adjustable camera, which is a pleasant new necessity (given the level design). Like the first Lords of Shadow, LoS2 has a deeper combat system than you might give it credit for at first appearance, it'll grow on you, but it doesn't go as far as some contemporaries and on all but the highest difficulties you won't struggle in battle.  LoS2 has a few obvious issues. While there's some goofy and entertaining narrative chunks to push you forward early on, there's also some sluggish tutorialization. The two timelines are enjoyable, but the past clearly has the art design edge- with the present not really distinguishing itself nearly as much. You'll probably greet flashlights with a weary sigh as the signal in another easy, brainless stealth section that, conceptually, is used to break up the monotany of entertaining flashy combat and brisk level design. Yeah, great idea.  At the end of the day, Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 is a likeable sequel. It's self-aware, in many aspects, with fantastic options like 'Turn off QTEs' which I highly recommend, as well as boasting satisfying boss encounters. It unfortunately struggles with branching out and exploring new gameplay elements. The pacing could be tighter... But, that said, I had a lot of fun with it. There are some great sequences, great moments that play off of the crazy Castlevania Dracula power trip which make it easy to recommend to fans of the first game. When it's firing on all cylinders, it captures the essence of what so many people liked about the first.   It hits a lot more than it misses and is worth your time and money if you happened to enjoy the first. It runs great, looks great and is fun to play. While it didn't surpass my expectations, it met them.",

First LoS was a really boring game, but at least the story was coherit, the art style was beautiful and it, while borrowed, truly *tried*. It felt like it was trying to be a good an exciting game. Usually it wasn't. But it's the thought that counts. Mirror of Fate was surprisingly fantastic, falling slightly flat from what people expect from the 2D Castlevania, but a fun mix of classic games in the series with gameplay elements of LoS. LoS 2 tries to improve. It looks better technologically, tries to rebalance some things in a good way, makes camera mostly good, removes the linear level progress in favor of the open world and makes soundtrack especially nice. And then adds forced stealth sections. And boring bland looking levels. And 'secrets' which usually feel like pointless stuff. And incoherit storytelling without any conflict you can feel (but it's there, honest!). This feels like Blood Omen 2 recreated in LoS universe. Except Blood Omen 2 was still a pretty okay game with some excitement and Kain, while this game just... is. LoS 1 was boring, this game just exists. It's just there. And you can play it. But you really shouldn't. P.S. Playing as Alucard in the DLC is fun, but that's about all there is to the DLC. It tells nothing new at all, despite the title.",

After playing it I can't figure out how it got such a low score when its actually a fantastic game. I imagine it may have had some issues when it first came out but I haven't come across anything game breaking, I did have one crash but I didn't lose any saves and continued where I left off. The game is a lot of fun despite confusing backtracking to gather up hidden items or items hidden behind requiring speciall skills you gain as you play through the story. The story itself isn't exactly the best but the skills you can unlock, the different enemies, and the boss fights are in my opnion fun and satisfying. If you see this game go on sale I say its absolutely worth the money and to go ahead and get it if you like hack and slash games, especially one where you play as Dracula.",

The different powers that you pick up during the game add a fun challenge to break up the hack-and-slash that the first game depended too much on. I think, unfortunately, that the developers listened to too many people while they were in the creative process, and it caused a bit of a mess. Overall, I still liked the game, though I would have just as impressed if it was simply a movie.",

I beat my first run on the second hardest difficulty (considered hardest until you beat it... semi-smart idea for a rerun) in about six hours, and that's with finding most of the collectables along the way. The reason why I have so many hours put into this is because I actually like walking around and beating stuff up; it's that fun to do it.  My other complaint (but rather a nitpick) was the difficulty. Even on the hardest I found the game is way too easy, but that's maybe because of my experience with these types of games. Others will say it's hard and I won't disagree with them. Some people can work with it while others can't.  I enjoyed the story (Though how well it connected with the first game was pretty stale) but really wished that they put a lot more time into it for a full price game (that 6$ off because of pre-order did help slightly). The combat is fun to play around with and the idea of upgrading your weapon is interesting but the makers kept it simple, which is alright.  I'd recommend it to anyone once the price goes down or if it goes on sale. 6 hours runtime for 60$ is kind of disappointing, especially with a decently good story behind it.  Until then!",

To be brief, the models, animations, textures, lighting effects are simply superb. I would often walk into new environments and just pan the camera around to take it all in. The craftsmanship of the content is what propelled me towards the end.  However, my big concern with this game is that I was hoping for a different mix of ingredients. In most action/adventures games (God of War, Batman: Arkham series) there is a nice mixture of combat, exploration, puzzle solving, and traversal (climbing, swimming, grappling, etc.) What I wanted from Lord of Shadow 2 was 50% combat and 50% everything else. What I got was basically 15% combat with a TON of emphasis on uninspried puzzles, boring traversal, and some rather obvious exploraiton. There were many, many times in the game when I would walk down a hallway and wish I would be jumped by a bad guy just so I could use my weapons.  In the end, I still played and enjoyed it. But I wished for a lot more combat and a lot less of everything else.",

            "review_text": "I had a much better time with this than I expected. The early reviews for the game made it sound like it was terrible, but it really wasn't that bad. However, that's not to say it isn't without its flaws.   The highlight of the game is probably its combat. You get three different weapons this time around instead of just magical powerups for the whip like in the original LOS: A light magic sword, dark magic gauntlets, and the whip returns as the default weapon. Each has their own style and role in combat; the sword can heal you when you do damage, the gauntlets do more damage than the other two overall and can also break enemy blocking, and the whip has good crowd control skills and has more range overall. Each weapon also has a fleshed out skill/move set tree that you can unlock with experience points. Gabriel controls more or less the same as he did in LOS with a couple tweaks, like a free moving camera.  For the overall main plot the game is shorter than the original Lords of Shadow, but it has much more in the way of secret items and challenge modes. The game is also much less linear than the original, with a semi-open world map that you can freely roam when not in a specific mission. The voice work is high quality, with much of the cast of the original returning (Patrick Stewart FTW) along with some new cast members who give a great performance as well. The game itself also looks great with very detailed and unique locals, characters, and monsters.  The biggest let down of the game is probably the forced stealth sections. They slow down what is normally a relatively fast paced game to a crawl, and don't work out well with how the game controls. They also don't really make sense in the context of the game, you are supposed to be this powerful being and yet these power armored lackeys can utterly destroy you if they see you. Thankfully there aren't many of these sections, and the rest of the game definitely makes up for it.  Overall I'd say the game is pretty good and is definitely worthwhile if you've played the other Lords of Shadow games.",

Combat has been refined from lords of shadow, instead of light and dark magic you have two new weapons that change things up in a nice way. It really adds to the fantasy of being Dracula. You can now block while in the air and that is a nice change. You can suck blood, you use a blood whip....it's good.  My only complaint with the combat is that it takes a long time to upgrade your moves as each different weapon has combos and many end up being very similar. I felt forced to repeat a few canned moves at times just to level up my weapons at times.  Boss fights are all pretty great, though I did feel the ending was a bit of let down. No spoliers but the last boss was not all it was hyped up to be.  Story is alright, you do get to jump between some castle levels and city levels. To be honest the city levels did feel very strange and while some of the structures and areas evoked a sense of older Castlevania themes...it just didn't really do it for me. I would rather have had eveyrthing in an older setting.  I found the game enjoyable though, and would recommend a play through.",

            "review_text": "Lords of Shadow 2 is ostensibly the last game in the Lords of Shadow trilogy created by MercurySteam, and possibly the final game in the Castlevania series, due to Konami moving on to more 'profitable' ventures. On paper, this game has all the ingredients needed to send the series out with a bang; amazing graphics, expanded combat and upgrade system, larger and more explorable world, great score, and stellar voice cast. However, when taken together, it doesn't quite reach the heights of the first Lords of Shadow game. One of the biggest problems is the story, which is all over the place as the player jumps between the past and present, represented by the enormous castle where Dracula resides, and the modern-day, gothic city. While MercurySteam's attention to detail and graphical prowess shine in both sections of the game, the city just wasn't as compelling as the castle, and every time I had to go back to the city to complete an objective, I sighed. This point extends to the gameplay in the city as well, which boasts uninspired and frustrating enemies, and stealth sections. In truth, the enemies in the city weren't actually that bad; I just felt that the castle's enemies were much better designed, and fit the 'Castlevania' theme. Despite these issues, the core gameplay and combat is solid, and for the most part, better than the first game. The player is also free to roam around both areas looking for upgrades and collectibles; gone is the chapter-by-chapter format. Even with the story jumping around, it is fairly interesting, and the cast does a good job of keeping the player involved. However, the biggest problem emerged during the last third of the game, where it seemed like interesting characters and plot developments were either dropped or rushed to conclusion, culminating in a disappointing final sequence and boss that paled in comparison to the epic scale and confrontations of the first game. Stretching out some story moments or expanding on all the concepts that the narrative introduced would have made the story feel much more put together and complete. And ultimately, it is this feeling of 'what could have been' that drags this game down to being simply good, and not great. There are some cool moments, and I did enjoy the experience enough to recommend this game, but it could have been so much more. And that's just a shame.",

            "review_text": "Dont believe the metacritic review score, decide for yourself. This is a beautifully crafted game with a fun and intuitive combat system. The controls are far tighter than LoS 1 so you have more room for precise dodging. The story jumps a bit and is certainly lacking in some areas but there are no more plot holes in this than in LoS 1. If you listen to the story you may even start feeling emotional in parts.  As the game progresses and recover more abilities it makes you start to feel alot more powerful though not too powerful as to make the game feel too easy.  However it is not all good in this game obviously. Enemy AI can be horribly broken sometimes and its not always obvious how to eascape a situation when hit by an unblockable attack. Button mashing is prevelant and not always in a good way though the quicktime events are suitably entertaining. The game has a way of ALWAYS giving some enemies an unfair advantage, some of which you can't counter until later in the game. But going back to these areas after playing more of that game allows you to access previously inaccessible areas. Graphically the game is amazing with the castle sections being much, MUCH better than the city. It does make you wish the impending apocalypse would hold of for a bit though so you could truely strike terror into the people of the modern day as DRACULA PRINCE OF DARKNESS! *ahem*  overall 8/10 I would say definately worth it if you liked the first LoS, are interested in Gabriel's story and prefer faster paced action, while still having to think on your feet.",
