    "description": "Taking the form of wacky shenanigans and a first-person experience of a bad trip, Californium pays homage to sci-fi legend Philip K. Dick (Blade Runner, Minority Report, Total Recall, The Man in the High Castle, etc.) by transporting you into the life of a writer who is searching for his own identity.",

            "review_text": "The game takes inspiration from the incredible Philip K ♥♥♥♥. PKD fans will definitely find something interesting here.  The game is a little out there at times however this is personally something I look for and love in games. I like games that strive to be a little different, one reason I love indies so much. My playthrough took about 3.5 hours and the story moves along at a steady pace. The english voice acting is top notch and the visuals while simple really stand out with the great use of colours. The puzzles are simple in design and some take a little time to find, lucky for me the couple of times I was having troubles viewers were there to make suggestions.  I did run into a bug in the restuarant at the start of Chapter 2 and had to restart it, luckily for me we had a couple of devs in the twitch chat who explained the bug without us wasting to much time. The game has already had its 1st update which should have fixed this bug along with others.  This is a difficult game to recommend due to it being a little different. However fans of PKD or people that are into quirky games will likely get a kick out of it. I do suggest scanning the game on youtube / twitch to know what your getting into. I made a VOD fof my playthrough.  The game is definitely strange but I loved it.",

            "review_text": "Some five hours into the game. Very atmospheric. This game is not a shooter or rpg, not even an adventure game in that sense. There are no items, no inventory. All atmosphere. This is a game that has to be slowly appreciated, do not rush through any of the sections. Read the posters on the walls, look at the clothing on the characters. Entire worlds are created here in this game!   This game is, to me, a real 3D novel. A science fiction story come to life.   The cars cannot hit you, you cannot die.   The game opens I to his large apartment. Walk slowly through the rooms, every object reflects not only the first person avatar,s life, these objects also reflect the world culture that exists in the world that you are in.  A tip or to to max your enjoyment. Those street cut out characters are not there just for atmosphere. Each has a long story to tell you when you bump up against each. But do not stop coming up to them when their lines are done with! Like in some RPGs, each character often has a number of sentences to say, hear them out until they repeat themselves.  There are hot spots to activate. Some can be hard to find. Often these can be activate from hundreds of feet away!  The game saves only at each world completion! Thus when you are able to leave the apartment and walk out onto the street, you are still in that one world yet!  I love atmospheric games like this one. Thus I give this game a five out of five. Many do not like the game. Probably these people are those who might not spend more than three minutes in Pompey, before getting back onto the tour bus!  Freestone ",

            "review_text": "I really enjoyed this. It maybe helps if you are a fan of the sci-fi writer Philip K. D-i-c-k (thanks swear-word filter!), whose life and works inspired the game (and are alluded to within it). For example, PKD had all sorts of 'interesting' ideas about parallel worlds, alternate realities, artificial intelligence, robots, and mind-alterting drugs/technologies.  The game mechanics are simple (find the Sigils and click on them -- that's basically it!), but the overall tone and theme are very engaging. There are clues to the location of the Sigils if you pay close attention to lighting and audio cues, or to apparent visual 'glitches' (not all of which are bugs!). The art and music are excellent, and the 'other world' portal effect is very nice too.  Caveats: there *are* a few genuine bugs (dodgy collision etc.), and the only save-points are automatic ones at the start of each chapter.. so give yourself time to play a whole section in one sitting (each of the 3 main chapters takes about an hour to get through).",

            "review_text": "tldr version - a tentative yes to recommending the game, given the low price and that it is innovative and quirky. I would have caveats on that recommendation, and those are in the LBRIA (long but read it anyway) version below  - I am a big fan of PKD. Some works inspired by him (take the novel 'Philip K ♥♥♥♥ is Dead, Alas' for example) can be excellent and expand upon the PKD universe in interesting ways, almost existing as part of it. I didn't feel this game really did that though, to me it felt more like re-used ideas from his books and writings without any real expansion on them, which was a shame.  - It also seemed to miss some of the charm and humour that fills a PKD novel.  - Personally, I was a bit uncomfortable with the audio used in the end chapter, but to save on any sort of spoiler I won't discuss what that was. Those who know PKD's life will know what the audio represents.   - I fell through a wall to ground level from the first floor, leaving the elevator I used to get there still up top. I could then enter a big open space behind where the elevator should have been - doing so triggered the elevator to come down, which promptly pushed me through the wall, trapping me between the wall, a desk and a door.  The kind of reality breakdown the game had not intended to include! I was disappointed that this relatively short, small, and fairly constrained game had bugs like that in it.  - No saves. If you start a chapter, finish it, else you'll be back at the start when you come in again. This is particularly vexing if you get squeezed into a stuck situation by a glitched elevator, for example.  - No explanation at the beginning! For those stuck, type the faded letters representing the ongoing story on the typewriter. For the rest of the game, I like that the mechanics weren't explained and it was a voyage of small discoveries, but it will leave people thinking it's crashed if you throw them in to a static screen with none of the expected keys doing anything right at the outset.  - Very short, so keep that in mind if considering it. Doesn't seem to be much that would reward repeat playthroughs (based on having repeated some chapters due to the lack of saves ahem.)  - The mixing of realities sure was neat though, as were the stories of each chapter. Just wish it had been developed further, personally.  - The areas to explore are fairly limited, and the mechanics of the puzzles are too. Since it's short, that doesn't get old, but did leave me feeling like this could have been so much more!  - If you like The Stanley Parable, you might like this too; though Stanley is more rewarding of repeat playthroughs, and manages to have more of the wry humour and wit that would have fitted in well here!",
