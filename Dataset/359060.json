            "review_text": "Very challenging game. It starts out easy for maybe the first 3 levels until all types of barriers come into play. The visuals are pleasing, and the ost is nice. I really like that some of the proceeds for this go to charity. I'm an old school Wipeout player used to insane speeds, but i mean it when i say this gets hard FAST. I have so far played about 7 or 8 levels in and i am struggling to not hit barriers as i switch lanes.   Some suggestions: I would like to see more controller compatibility with the menu, the way the controls are mapped for the 360 game pad is a bit strange.   Anyone who likes Audio Surf would probably like this, the concept is very similar.",

            "review_text": "Switch Galaxy Ultra is a game can play intensly or relexed (if you don't get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off quickly) It also has a stratagy aspect to it and this is what makes it a lot more intrusting. I would recommend it if you have epilepsy or motion sickness (i have motion sickness and there are some levels where that really kicks in and there are also flashy intro screens) you collect tokens to unlock other levels the further you get the harder it is to get the tokens and the more you need so if you like a challenge it is a awesome game.
