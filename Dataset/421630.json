Every choice you make feels like it has weight and impact on the story, while still flowing together to create a whole narrative. The character you play as feels like a real person and rather than making descions based on numbers or what will bring the best outcome I found myself thinking 'What would he do under the circumstances?' I just can't recommend this game enough to anyone who enjoys story-based games.",

Glad I found this one, a favorite genre of mine,steampunk, was the best choic i could have made. Not only is this fun but it is well written and believable!! I completely recommend this masterpiece and encourage the people behind it to write more in the future. Now i am a bonafide fan of this type of game/story/book and adventure. A+",

I think there was only one instance that a decision I wanted to make wasn't already listed, and I usually want to make odd choices! So I was quite happy with what they had! There is also the replay value! So many avenues you can take your stories and try again to see where they lead! This is a highly recommended game!",
