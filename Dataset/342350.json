Amazing sound considering creative commons, amazing environment and feel.  Regardless of the graphics (which I think adds a charm and cool factor), this game is genuinely scary.  Buy it now.",

            "review_text": "Into the Gloom is an atmospheric gem of a horror game. It has little to no jumpscares, and the ones it have are rare and not even loud, yet so effective since done right. Into the Gloom is also riddled with mind-boggling puzzles, which can be difficult if you miss some details; two puzzles for sure may even take up to 15-30 minutes to fully figure out. Despite being made in Unity engine, the environment is eerie and well set up, with a chilling and foreboding atmosphere. To top it off, Into the Gloom offers a detailed and complex story, which can guide you in getting the game's 5 endings. If longer horror games with lore puzzles and full of adventure is your thing, I highly recommend you to play Into the Gloom right now!",

I had the tile and evertything,however, nothing had worked. I hope that this is not a bug, or it is just my keyboard playing up.   Anyway,that is my review of into the Gloom, worse comes to worse i'll make another review on it.   4/10 for now",
