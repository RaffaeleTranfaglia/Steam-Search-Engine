I really like the idea of an interactive VR IKEA brochure.  And now you can try cooking the meatballs, which is a nice bonus :) (although my wife just trashed the joint, covering the floor in meatballs and pots.)",

There are a few little things to play with, and if you're actually interested in looking at different furniture, than maybe you would be interested. Download it while you're sleeping, and play around in this experience. It's worth your time, even if you just want to spend 10 minutes in it and delete it. It's an interesting look into how VR can go beyond just gaming and perhaps into other areas, with a well polished look and set of interactions.",

Surprisingly good immersion, though I think the experience would be much improved if you were able to 'accidentally' start a small kitchen fire that got out of control. Would cook my balls again though, meatballs that is.",

            "review_text": "Okay, now I understnad that this is called IKEA VR Experience, so I probably shouldn't have expected much. However, I wished there was more than what truly is in this. I thought that in this game you would be able to like maybe decorate a room using ikea furniture, or even possibly getting to build it or something besides this. I mean I guess it's 'okay' but this is more like a one time play, so at least it's free. But all you get to do really is walk around a kitchen filled with what I'm assuming IKEA furniture, and change one or two things in there, but that's all. So if you're expectations were the same as mine, and you also don't mind paying for a game, I would go ahead and get Home Improvisation: Furniture Sandbox. But side note to the creators: if you want this game to go more, maybe you should take some notes from the other game I mentioned and other furniture simulators. Please don't be offended, just trying to help.",
