            "review_text": "New player to Shadowverse, been playing Hearthstone for about a year and a half and I just wanted to jump in and say this game is bloody great! I love how the classes are completely unique from one another and love the tactics involved with classes like Havencraft and Bloodcraft.  I used to be CRAZY into CCG's and TCG's (Played Yu-Gi-Oh as my first ever, and finally moved onto Magic soon after). My passion for TCG's and CCG's eventually died out after I'd grinded my heart and soul out on Hearthstone. Getting to high rank felt meaningless and Arena was a struggle as my Gold wasn't able to handle much more than a few a week. It has become more of a frustration rather than fun for me. Ladder was full of mindless decks which plays themselves and every opponent felt like they were bots, not human beings. F2P model of the HS makes the game infinitely grindy which forces you to pay to compete even at the lowest ranks. I was enjoying arena until it has become repetitive because of the dominant two or three classes so I quit.  The game is extremely generous to you when you first start out, which really helps. Sure they give less gold compared to HS. But you only get one pr day. That is a bit of a vital difference. The score scheme plus the greater number of achievements are awesome. Which you are actually told about unlike Hearthstone where you basically have to go looking to sites to figure out what they want you to do. Plus daily log in bonus rewards. And finally. Arena tends to be more rewarding as well. So yes. I do see this game as a lot more generous than HS. Again. In just one week. I've gotten more than I've ever gotten in HS.  You can also tell who came directly from Hearthstone and play exactly like Hearthstone as they play Swordcraft and just go face with everything no matter what like they are playing Zoo or Hunter lol. I just laugh and accept my free win as once turn 4 hits and my board fills with 3-4 big minions some with rush and then use evolve and destroy/banish spells to clear out all the junk and say hello to another win.  So do I recommend it? Hell yes I do.",

For example, there's the ability to Evolve one unit every few turns. Evolved units become much stronger and if evolved on the turn they are played, they can immediately attack. There are also Amulets, cards that can't attack or be attacked but have effects that last as long as they remain in play. This game has also great visuals and such beautiful music. So, if you enjoy CCGs and have been looking for something with a different feel than Hearthstone, you should check out Shadowverse.",

If you like card games but hate how less rewarding hearthstone was this is a great game to try. When I first started this game I accumulated about 40+ packs compared to hearthstone barely giving you maybe 10 packs at most during that span. These 40 packs can pretty much allow you to build 2 solid decks on the get go and start competing online unlike hearthstone where you still have to buy adventures just to get certain cards to complete a deck. They also give you about 11+ free 'tickets' for their version of arena after completing all the story modes. So if you like drafting like in hearthstone and magic, the game give you multiple chances for free to try it out compared to the 1 free chance given by hearthstone. From the art to the story to the depth of strategy to the achievements to unlock there is a lot this game has to offer.",

            "review_text": "Japan's most popular CCG finally comes to Steam. I have played this game a tonne on mobile and have endless praise for this game. Many people will draw a comparison to Hearthstone when they see this game, 'Anime Hearthstone' they call it, but having played Hearthstone since release I can say this game far surpasses its Blizzard counter-part.   The game is incredibly new player friendly and the developers are very generous when it comes to free gifts. Cygames also actively balance their game, making changes to cards or mechanics when they need it, this opened my eyes and was a huge factor of why I would leave Hearthstone behind. The developers clearly care about their game and more importantly the community it is incredinly refreshing to see.  The game brings a plethora of new mechanics as well as familar ones which gives the game a fresh but habitual feel. Classes all have unique mechanics available to them but these mechanics do not restrict the type of playstyle of decks you can build.   The evolve mechanic in particular brings an exciting depth to the game, especially the mid game where you can evolve followers with powerful effects to swing the board state back into your favour or to apply more pressure. The mechanic brings a new layer of strategy and mindgames which has never been seen before in digital CCGs.  Definetly try out this game if you are interested, it won't cost you anything to get started and will require next to no investment to play. The majority of players are f2p and it's great to enjoy a game that you are not financially chained to.",

The game itself contain main waifus if u like those kind of thing, the type in this game just like usual.  Card Type in this game (pick the one most suit ur playstyle), i just explain it in nutshell :    Forestcraft : early monster, this card beat enemy with number instead with power and some more spell to ensure early victory(low elo on late game)    Swordcraft : Synergy of officers &amp; commander to break through with combo &amp; spell (u need both appear to be on full power)    Runecraft : who need to much monster, when spell is better (well, less ward more squishy)    Dragoncraft : late starter deck, dragon control the field on mid game to late, one of best raw power deck (pretty hard in early game and raw power mean weak to crowd control deck)    Shadowcraft : deadly effect with 'necromancy' use them wisely &amp; many low cost minion (wrong time &amp; wrong effect cause u lost the game)    Bloodcraft : hit me hit me, then go strong when your leader hp turn to 10 (careful, don't go too gungho with this deck and this type bad agains defensive/crowd control deck)    Havencraft : summon amulet &amp; control the game with spell to instantly destory enemy monster (pretty much defensive type on early this deck only can def, but blast on mid and late)  The Pros of this game : + Many kind of deck to build &amp; try + Pretty good art &amp; fluid movement + The english VA actually really good + The music suit the situation to add more immersion + Not pay 2 win, just luck &amp; draw your card. Booster pack just make u build ur deck faster + They have short story for each hero + Last but not least, hey they have many waifus  The cons : - Kinda hard to win early on when ur deck setup still kinda so - so - Need patience (or luck), but you can create card by destroying other card so yeah.",

            "review_text": "Since everyone is comparing it to Hearthstone anyway, lets run the list:  PROS + Toned-down RNG. Most RNG cards can be manipulated, which is the right way to do RNG (for instance: if a card deals 1 damage to a random enemy follower, you can manipulate the board to get the hit you want, unlike Hearthstone, where you can always hit face and lose the game). + Evolve system is this game's Coin, but unlike Coin it's a full mechanic with depth, strategy and it will happen at least five times a game. + Somehow the cards feel more balanced than Hearthstone - a couple of Japanese guys beat a multi-million company in design? (for instance: most early-game cards are weaker because of how much tempo they can generate) + The monetization. I'm playing this game for two days and I think I already have most of the cards I need for my two decks. You get Gold and Pack Tickets for almost everything. You have challenges that give you Gold. + Animated (Golden) cards cannot be crafted, so it still makes sense to buy packs. + Anime boobs everywhere.  CONS - The UI could use a bit of work, it's not as responsive as Hearthstone. - The PC UI is a straight-up lift from the phone version. It's not terrible, but sometimes it shows. - Take-Two, this game's version of limited/Arena isn't that great, it my opinion. But it's price structure is a lot better than Hearthstone. There's also space on the UI for other versions of Arena.  In short - RIP Hearthstone, unless they manage to screw this one up, somehow. DON'T SCREW THIS ONE UP",

The ones that are helpful usually compare the game to Heathstone as well, but instead give an actual review with it. With all the comparisons with Hearthstone and other card games it may be hard to judge if you want to give this game a try if you, just like me, never played a digital card game before. This review is not for people that are pretty familiar with digital card games but if you want a full first experience of a person that never played one, you might want to stick around to see if it is something you are interested in as well.

I was able to do fine for some characters, but for the classes I didn't get great cards for, I was basically stuck.  I get it, they want money, but puting down a massive difficulty spike in the story mode against an opponent with better cards than you in an effort to get you to shell out money for more cards isn't really a friendly tactic. It's entirely possible I'm just terrible at the game or got unlucky. Either way I have to uninstall because it's causing me no end of frustration and the temptation to give in and buy more cards is there, but it wouldn't be because I'm having fun in the game, it would be just to get past one chapter of the story mode, and that's not really a good motivation for me to keep going.",

Evolving is the biggest thing seperating this game from Hearthstone, which helps mitigate bad RNG with good play, but despite this there are still unwinnable scenarios and evolving only does so much. Like Hearthstone, going first vs going second has distinct advantages, and players need to keep this in mind when deciding when to evolve.   Class variety is great, as what seperates each class is not a hero power but their abilities (passives) that change how their class cards play. For instance, many of Bloodcraft's cards become stronger when they are at or below 10hp, so it becomes a class with high risk and comeback potential. Runecraft boosts the spells in their hand, becoming a class where most of their advantage is hidden until they play their hand.   There is effectively no notable single player experience. There is technically a story mode, but it's short and the core gameplay is in online matches and arena. Perhaps there might be more story in future patches, but I wouldn't hold my breath.  Overall, a fun children's trading card game. If you've played Hearthstone, most of the fundamentals will carry over to Shadowverse. If not, it's simple enough to pick up and Cygames is generous with card packs when you start out. However, this is a competitive game by nature, so as you improve, games will inevitably get more rage-inducing, so be prepared for that.",

In arena basicly every class can get to max wins. There is no tier list or sth like that. Of course a few clases are easier to draw but it doesn't matter that they will loose all their matches. (ekhhhh... Priest is HS... ) And there is no god-clas in arena (maybe you can say swordcraft is pretty good in arena, but not on Mage level is HS)  This game is free to play. And what I mean by that IT'S FREE TO PLAY. Developers give you soooo much. You don't have to spend a penny to play what you want. Just play the game and in short time you will have pretty decent collection.  Art style is very subiective. I personally really like it. I love looking at my cards they look soo good, and animated cards look sick :D  Overall game feels great. I reccomend it to all CCG fans and anime fans.",

Every single match I play now involves playing against the witchcraft class decks with the broken turn duplicate spell that lets you have consecutive turns and the legendary witch card that does that “thing”. I literally played against four people in a row that were using the same awful build that I found to be extremely cheap. At first I was surprised by how nice the visuals were and how the game played, but now I’m starting to see the exploits in the game that are present in all free to play card games.   TLDR: Fun for a while but you will soon become overwhelmed by the same cheap decks that everyone and their moms use at higher ranks...  Edit: I like this game but the devs are acting like there isn’t a meta and that people don’t generally play 'other decks more than others' (in their own words). I’m going to continue to play because the devs are generous and I generally like their game. However, I honestly can’t give this games a thumbs up if meta balances aren’t going to be addressed.",

The publisher, Cygames, write blog posts regarding balance in the current meta-game with each expansion. The balance changes so far made sense, and the effects were as intended, without collateral damage or being excessive.  The rewards and starter package is plenty (17 Standard packs and 26 Darkness Evolved packs when I started), and new players can get close to 4000 rupies (Standard currency, 100 rupies = 1 pack) with simple one-time missions, and daily missions (which have individual timers) almost always amount to at least 100 rupies a day, though there is no '3 wins = some money' system like that of Hearthstone.
