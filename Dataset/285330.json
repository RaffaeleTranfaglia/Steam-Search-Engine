Well over 1000+ hours on this baby and still kicking strong. When I found out they had it for steam and it worked on my new desktop instead of those funky colors, I was stoked! Now I am continuing my saves that are on my backup drives from years ago! Its a blast still to this day.   Heck I first got this game in elementary school at a Scholastic book sale. It was THE LAST DISK avalible. Man, to thinkthat if there was one more class before us, I may have never found out about this gem. Not a fan of the new 3D versions, wish they would go back to the old way and just update everything again. RCT2....forever and ever.   10/10 would go back to elementary and get disk again.",

I easily poured about three thousand hours into that disk, and I loved every second of it. By the end of it I had well over 200 save files, some of which were actual serious parks and the rest simple sandbox parks where I had no objective and just ♥♥♥♥ed around with the patrons. Then, the unthinkable happened. A virus destroyed the family computer, and when we got a new one, I found that the disk refused to install on it. Fast forward ten or so years later. I was browsing steam out of boredom when I stumbled across Roller Coaster Tycoon 2 again, bundled together with its two expansion packs for a humble price of $11 CAN. Childhood memories came rushing back in a blur and I nearly fell off my bed in sheer excitement. A week later I got my hands on a copy of the game (Thank you, Jordy!!) and I was soon on my way to a serious nostalgia trip.   The Pros!",

            "review_text": "It's pretty hard not to do a joke review about this game with all of the top-tier memes it gives you.  However, this is a game I hold dearly. It has a place in my heart no other game can fill, and it will always be the first computer game I ever had that gave me something to show off to friends with.  You see, if you got this game from a cereal box (like most of us did), you are part of the best generation to experience PC gaming.  Or, who knows. Maybe you played the crap out of text-based adventures back in the day and just happened to love sugary cereal at the tender age of adulthood.  It truly was a good time to get into the idea of gaming on your computer. Not because legendary, classic titles came in cereal boxes, but because everyone of the 'common genres' of game weren't set in stone yet and plenty of new companies were making PC games that were always probing an aspect of the video game that hasn't been looked into before. Nowadays the market of new games can be separated into 'niche indie titles', 'AAA games with PC ports' and the rare 'well-rounded good game'. Back then... you had the Tycoon series.  Ladies and gentlemen, the Tycoon series of games was probably what saved me from adolescent boredom and actually gave me something fun to do on Windows 98.  Bored after school? Boot up 'Extreme Heights' and build another coaster that manages to do 10 loops in a row.  You could basically build whatever park you wanted and force dumb, oblivious NPCs to eat up whatever crap you make. The system was intricate. It was always giving you feedback for how reasonable your setup is, as well as fine-tuning over even the most menial tasks.  The slow nature of the game gave the players a lot of choice and challenge. Do you spend all of your money at once for something that can either make or break the park, or build a bunch of safe, small rides that will only gradually build me money?  It feels a little weird writing this review because of the fact that I never really stopped with RollerCoaster Tycoon games. It's a game I will always respect and my one hope is that it is never lost and forgotten.  The nostalgia value in this game is equivalent to Sock 'Em Boppers and Lincoln Logs.",

There was however intel pentium...and Roller Coaster Tycoon!!. I remember spending hours, meticulously building my park from scratch, earning milions on big rides and food, attracting 6k+ guests into my park...and then torturing them, by cutting off the escape routes, flooding paths and charging $15 for toilet. And it was magical, pure joy. Even now, with the graphics definitely looking tired, it will bring you hours of very simple fun, build a ride and see how much you can charge before guests say its enough. Or starve them, then build one burger bar, put a very steep price and watch money flooding in. Or even better, build a coaster that will eventually crash, then comfort all the mourners with free black balloons...and free rides on the coaster that just has crashed! Yes, this game was always my favourite, a safe haven where I could unleash all my sadistic fantasies! And after all these years, nothing has changed, I still love to see the message 'Robert D. has just drowned'.",

He quickley realised the path he was on led to no where and he was doomed to walk this path until the day he dies. He continues walking the path as he spouts depressed phrases such as, 'I want to go home.' and 'I cant find the exit to the park.' and even once 'I have the strangest feeling someone is watching me.'

The ATM and boatload of scenery is especially a nice touch -I've read it's considered the 'best' Rollercoaster Tycoon, meaning there's likely a healthy supply of fanmade content for the game  CONS: -20 second long crowd noise loop still irritating as hell. 'ROLLER COASTER' 'BUT WHYYYYY' 'EHAHAHAHAHA. BWAAAHH. OOOHOOOOHOOOHOOO.' It was cute for nostalgic reasons for about 2 minutes before I wished they made a longer, more varied sound for crowded areas -It's pretty much the same as the first game except with more stuff, meaning they didn't seem to add that much -The scenarios suck my toes. Almost all of the ones I've tried so far make you wonder if they even put any thought into making them. Half the time the existing rides don't even have names. The scenery looks good (or, at least, it probably did back in the day, so I'm trying to judge it on that) but most of the time it just gets in the way. Sometimes guests get lost on the  pre-existing paths . You rarely allowed to charge per ride so you're stuck entirely relying on vendors and admission fees. Give me Forest Frontiers or Dynamite Dunes over Alcatraz and Rio anyday -Maybe I haven't figured it out yet but it seems like there's no way to access the Steam community inside the game, which makes playing while you're chatting with someone a pain in the neck.  Overall, despite my criticisms, it's cheap and fun and it's in no way worse than the original (aside from the scenarios). If you're asking yourself if you want to pick it up, you probably do.",

I bought RCT2 and the two expansions when they each launched, and the triple thrill pack - I used the TTP disc so much It was *taped together*. I spent hours getting it to line up when it started to crack. Thats a sign of how amazing this game is.  If you find building and sim games fun, you can't go wrong here. The customization and themes are awesome and can give hours of fun.  You can also download all of the maps from the original RCT for this, a large chunk of which were released officially, and hundreds if not thousands of other maps custom designed. There are some amazing parks out there.  Fun tip, there is a .dll mod out there to run it in windowed mode. For some reason its not default in RCT2, but it was an option in the original..",

So I will list pros and cons about rct2 compared to rct3  PRO'S:  - The peeps (AI) form sizeable queue lines for your rides, making you feel like your ride is popular - Lag does not exist in this game - Created by Chris Sawyer - Altogether, it feels like a better game (in my opinion, of course) - Go Karts are overpowered :) - Pre-built Six Flags amusement parks  - Awesome Pre-built rides (If you're lazy...) - Unique scenarios (i.e. Great Wall of China scenario where you have unlimited money but have to keep park rating above 700 at all times.)  CON'S: - No 3D view like in RCT3 - You can't ride your rollercoasters - Park staff are equally as useless as they are in RCT3 - No nighttime phase (some would consider that a pro)  CONCLUSION: Overall, there is not a significant difference between RCT 2 and 3. Atari didn't change much for RCT3 other than 3D view. If you thoroughly enjoyed RCT3, you will thoroughly enjoy this game.    ",

It's engaging enough to try to keep an amusement running smoothly, but even more fun if you put in some imagination and build something truly unique. One park I made was one that was a looooong line of carousels that exit into other carousels. No one ever made it to the end.  Just be warned that this game has some compatibility issues with modern PC's. I'd recommend getting OpenRCT2, as it fixes those issues and provides more options for screen resolution and mod support.",

This game not only provides players with the ability to create a vast range of coasters, flat and dark rides, but also allows your imagination to shine. A huge range of decoration and scenery items, allows you to create a park of your dreams. This game combines the ability to create wonderful turns and twists of roller coasters, whilst having to manage the park from a staff point of view.   Pricing of rides and merchandise, to taking out a loan to fund your new development area. This game has it all.   If you manage to complete the huge varied range of levels, all of which focus on different themes and objectives, you can create your own scenarios for others to play, or, design rides to import into your park.  I would highly recommend this game to anyone who has the most remote interest in theme parks!",

Even though this game got a lot of flak at launch for being much the same as the original game, I believe this title added a lot of extra elements that made the challenge mode experience more difficult and fun. It's a shame they made deathcoasters harder to make, but the added challenges and level editor had always drawn me to play this game instead of the original for so long. Buy this game on sale if you're not willing to put a lot of time into it though, there is no fast forward button and it requires you to idle for extended periods of time. Overall, a great game!",
