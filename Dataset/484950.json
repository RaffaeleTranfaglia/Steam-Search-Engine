My mistake was to get past few doors on second to last level with teleport skill because I didn't wanted to backtrack long distance to last merchant. Unfortunatelly after using it few times spell broke and I found myself trapped between locked doors - and because I seved after that - I had to start from beginning.",

            "review_text": "+ Nice visuals + Interesting concept + Easy mechanics + Challenging + Good visual ambientation. (Sadly that's all you get for ambientation).   - Poor resolution. - Worst controlls ever. EVERYTHING feels clunky and sluggish. - Music is OK, sound effects are just awful. - Practically no text/story. Only what you get in store page. - Not worth the price.  While the concept is good, execution is horrible. There are far better light RPG's out there for far less, just don't bother.",

Anyways, it's a good game that if you don't spend your keys to get an item and then got stuck for that ♥♥♥♥ing key (like me) you will have a good time playing it",
