            "review_text": "As someone who grew up in the early age of the SNES, NES and earlier platformers, this game is top grade nostalgia. In the day and age where literally every 'pixel indie game' is generic, boring and uninspiring, it's a shocker to see a game that actually feels like it's something that would have been released a few decades ago. Super Win the Game is the sequel to You Have to Win the Game as stated, and boy does it deliver. The game takes a lot of inspiration from age old classics such as Super Mario Bros 2, Zelda 2, and much more. What really delivers in this game is a lot of backtracking, which was a key essential in adventure games back in the day. Some paths are inaccesible until you find certain powerups or items to advance or get jewels. The game overall would be quite short without the backtracking, but it's this exact key concept that retro games back then used to expand playtime on cartridges with rather small storage space, which is why the game feels exactly like an NES game. But of course, it's not just that. The additional options and features of having the old 'CRT TV Monitor' with adjustable visual settings, along with the optional 'reverb' for the chiptune styled music completes the experience and makes you feel like this game was actually made ages ago and not in 2014.   TL;DR Nostalgia and NES freaks, this one is for you!",

            "review_text": "This was the first game i bought on steam and it still remains as my most favorite. I love retro games and this one felt like it fit in with all the classics, and i have no regrets spending 8 extra hours resetting it and beating it 100% again just to get 1 achievement.   Super Win The Game is a must- play for everyone, especially those who have played the original and/ or love retro-styled platformers with amazing nostalgic and memorable soundtracks, tons of secrets, speed running, infinite lives (who wouldn't love that!), and puzzling dungeons.  This game fills me with so happiness because over time it just grew on me with its charm. Despite its simplicity and lack of the action that attracts most modern audiences, it was entertaining, unique, and ultimately satisfying with every room i completed. I don’t even want to know how many times I died in this game (there is a counter), but i could never rage quit knowing I had another item to collect that would make my travels faster and help me overcome the next obstacle that kept me from accessing another area.  Its free-roam exploration design on a huge map filled with a vast amount of environments kept the adventure interesting, and i can still remember how mindboggling it was when I discovered one of the many secret areas in the game. i did find them all on my own, but I eventually did need to use a guide to keep track of collecting the 128 gems available to collect for a 100% play through.  Back tracking is required, but it becomes much easier as you advance and collect more powers and items in game. I found it interesting how even the hardest areas were accessible from the start of the game, but something as minor as a single platform would keep you from going where you are not supposed to because you are too early in the story. The only way I had figured out where I had to go next was by looking at where I had already been and finding the places I had not yet explored, or I had to back track to find out that an NPC’s dialogue that I had skipped had secret information as to a location of an item important to advancing. Thus, PATIENCE AND CURIOSITY IS KEY   Anyways, I CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH how charming, unique, frustrating, and deep this game is, and you would understand my rambling much better if you played it yourself.  10/10 Would play again....    and again.",

Metroidvania done right is what this game is. Faithful to its source material (every sound seems to remind you of The Goonies 2 or Megaman). 10/10 would recommend.",

I found it quite fun to search behind every nook and cranny to look for a secret item, some of which I still have to find. This game is definitely a must have if you are into deathless runs, speedruns, races with pals, or just for some pure nostalgia. One minor issue I have with the game, however, is that you can't really attack anything, so some unfair traps are to be expected. Despite limited combat and a few mean areas, the difficulty remains fair and simple, one of the hallmarks of a great NES game.  Overall, this game is highly recommended if you're looking for a nostalgia bomb or trying to find ways to challenge yourself even further. Can you beat the entire game in under 100 deaths on your first try? I don't think so!  4/5",

Much like VVVVVVV the platforming makes it incredibly easy to die, but with a checkpoint system that makes it just as easy to try again. Like a metroidvania game there are plenty of secrets to find and an array of upgrades to help you get to new areas. Features a Zelda II style overworld allows you to choose which areas you want to hit first, and a subcon hub zone that can quickly get you back to old areas when you have new albilities to try out.  Keep in mind though there is no combat in this game, it's all platforming. But that's really not a drawback, what it does, it does very well.",

The game is a lot fun, hard but now raging hard or impossible, but remembers me the good old games when you used to have more difficult in general in games. This Super Win the Game is an awesome 'sequel' to the You Have to Win the Game (which is free, everybody should check that out) and it mixes the castlevania style with metroid, mario, and a little bit of the legend of zelda I guess. The developers did such a good work making this masterpiece of the indie games world :)",

If you enjoyed the first game (You have to win the game) then you will enjoy this, if you haven't played the first game then go do it now, it's available on steam for free.  Compared to the original, Super continues the retro style, with the visuals this time emulating the appearance of NES games played on an old CRT,  The game shares a lot of visual similarities with Zelda II: Adventure of Link, which was a nostalgic experience for me, but if you weren't a fan of that game don't be put off, Super doesn't play the same and the difficulty is nowhere near as punishing and the game moves along at a brisk pace. You will never find yourself at loss for what to do next or stuck without a clue.  The difficulty is similar to the original, but it does away with the achievements for 9 lives / single life runs, making it much easier to 100% the achievements in this game (which may be positive or negative, depending on your preferences).  The size of the game world has increased over the original, featuring several interconnected areas linked by an overworld map and various secret passageways.  It took me around 8 hours to see everything the game offered and locate all of the collectables, which I felt was good value for money, especially if bought at a discounted price.",
