            "review_text": "I originally bought this game in 1990 while I was on vacation with my family in Bermuda at age 13. Despite the tropical paradise surrounding me, I spent a lot of time sitting in the hotel room reading through the extremely well done manual, excited to get home and give it a try. And, of course, when I finally did get home to try it, I played the living crap out of it.   I've always felt this game never got the recognition it deserved. I'm glad to see that it's available on Steam at a low price so those who missed out can give it a shot. Obviously, this is an old game and if the older graphics are a problem for you, you may not enjoy it. But if you are into the kind of gameplay provided by other Microprose games like Pirates!, you don't want to miss out on this.  Personally, I think a modern remake is in order.",

            "review_text": "Really a great game. It has simple controls with complex decision making. In regards to the controls, I highly recommend reading the manual and the technical supplement before you start playing. They explain what the controls are as well as what sorts of strategies you might want to employ in order to ascend the ranks of medieval Japan. With 4 difficulties, and 48 provinces to start from, this game has a lot of options that can fit any play style you might choose.   Types of choices you may come across. In the quest to increase your honor, you can complete quests offered by your lord, wander around killing bandits, OR you can sneak into your competitors estates and decrease their honor. Be careful though, if you get caught it takes a huge chunk of your own honor out. The game also takes several generations in order to win. You start off with your initial character being a youth, and as you increase your land and honor, you become a suitable spouse. After the marriage your wife will give you children and once you have a son you have an heir. If you decide not to get married you do have an appointed heir who is not related to you, really your preferance, but it is nice knowing your name will be carried on. Once your son grows up and your character dies control is transferred to your son and the cycle continues. You also have your daughters to consider though. Suitors will come with interests in marriage. This is useful in creating marriage alliances so choose your daughters husbands wisely.  While this game does have a lot going for it, the strategic army v. army battles are pretty clunky. Its not really a surprise considering this game is from '89, but really the only way the ensure victory is to have an overwhellmingly huge army against a moderate to small army.  so, in the end  Pros: Highly replayable Suits many play styles Very good RPG elements Fun Very nostalgic  Cons: Clunky RTS combat",

            "review_text": "Graphics aside - this game stands as a hallmark of design in computer gaming history. It is somewhat sad to see that it was 'cult' status but then again, just about all PC games were during the era in which this was published.   The game itself - is steeped in Japanese imagery and music... and bows low to Feudal Japan's system of honor and caste. It plays as a series of minigames with over-arching strategy that will span generations. One need make decisions in order to make oneself stand out amongst his peers for promotion. This can be done in numerous ways from performing feats of honor (by way of minigames - the duel, 1 vs many, or military engagements), or by subterfuge and treachery (inciting rebellion, insult, kidnapping, and even outright assassination).   As one progresses in game - your character will most likely be survived by an heir. And as one reaches Daimyo - the conquest and unification of Japan becomes the mission (as opposed to posturing oneself as the most honorable retainer amongst one's peers). This is where the game might more closely resemble 'Nobunaga's Ambition,' 'Romance of the three Kingdoms,' or 'Shogun: Total War' - as one would be concerned with the map of Japan and bringing each fief under his control.   While the game isn't overly complex the path to greatness is multifaceted and has a depth because of it. It's about honor, jockeying, and skill in all three mini-games.",

What to expect: Become Shogun or die trying  Prepare go dishonor a fellow Samurai to raise my own honor by kidnapping his wife, stealing his heirloom sword and murdering a guest of his. Then I will go save a village from bandit attacks after I raise the rice tax. I will then die during a duel but my son will take up my sword and I my dynasty will reign supreme... at least until all my male heirs are dead.",

Perhaps a glimpse of the true nature of Japanese Assassins who were actually Samurais just changing their standard in your face mindset into subterfuge and clandestine warriors.    ",
