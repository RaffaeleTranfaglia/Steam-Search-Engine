            "review_text": "Picture this: a haunted, gated patch of forest where the bodies of some children were mysteriously never found after their house burned down (think I have that right...maybe not)...pretty good setup for a ghost story, huh?  Now, there's a game called Wich that daring teenagers play involving one of the teens getting blindfolded and led into this same patch of forest, with nothing more than a handful of matches and some randomly placed candles to light his/her way. The idea being to survive the night alone!!  Cryptic drawings and relics from the past (3 for each hour of the night, midnight through 5:00 AM) vaguely hint at the strange goings-on of what really happened to the missing children and of the semblance of the ghosts that you'll encounter in your quest for survival.  Great, mist-enshrouded graphics with exceptional use of lighting and sound make Wick a truly unique and harrowing experience. It may be short but that only makes it that much more accessible for a future run or two anytime you feel like trekking through some woods without having to worry about that 'Slender' guy catching you : }",

            "review_text": "This game was my very first horror game ever. And I was not disappointed; I was scared so many times I lost count. The overall ambience and just the feeling that you're not alone in the woods at night was spot on. Each kid has their own unique abilites for terrifying you and building tension between jumpscares. The story line was so twisted I could not have guessed the ending. I got both endings to the game and without spoiling it I liked the second ending best!   10/10 Thank you Hellbent Games for my first experience with a horror game. :D  If anyone would like to see some gameplay (or see me scream like a little girl) just click on the link.

Graphics in my opinion are great, especially for the price. If interested in seeing more, check out my high quality gameplay. There is commentary so if that doesn't interest you, click it to see a little bit of gameplay. I've only played for about 13 minutes but I'd recommend this game to anyone who loves survival horrors. I plan to keep playing and hopefully learn a lot more about the game as I progress.           YouTube™ Video:  Let's Play - Wick | Survival Horror Playthrough - Part 1&nbsp;",

            "review_text": "You know, I really wanted to like Wick. It has some very great atmosphere, music, sound design, graphics, and a pretty cool candle mechanic. Unfortunately, we've played this game many times before. You walk around a dark forest while enemies randomly pop out of you in a rather hilarious way, you survive the night, onto the next night, and so forth. Imagine combining Slender: The Eight Pages and Five Nights at Freddy's into a game. Wick is literally that. Walk-through-a-forest-and-always-look-away simulator with some pretty cheap jumpscares that are only scary the first three times. I'm a MASSIVE horror junkie and I've played just about every horror game out there, so I can tell what's a quality horror game from one that's not. Wick gets boring rather fast without improving much to any of the gameplay. It does add a new enemy type to each night you survive, however, I rarely enccountered these enemies. The only characters to really pose a threat are the main enemy type; the ghost children. With bad design and dumb jumpscares, they lose their sense of being a scary threat too. The candle mechanic was done very well. You have a limited number of matches, which you use to light candles to keep the ghosts away while providing a light source. The candle starts to melt, so you have to be very careful with how you use your matches. If the enemy types were more scary and agressive, this would've made for a great game. If you enjoyed Slender and FNAF and are looking for games like them, Wick is worth the $10. However, if you're looking for a horror game that's different and doesn't misuse jumpscares, look further. A good horror game with great atmosphere and scares and around the same price range as Wick, try The Cursed Forest. I'm going to give Wick a 5/10.",
