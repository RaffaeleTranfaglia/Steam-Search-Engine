            "review_text": "While this game has the distinct appearance held by most RPGMaker titles, it stands out in every other way. The soundtrack is great on the standards of big production games, let alone independent titles. The gameplay does something unique for a JRPG, drawing inspiration from titles like Lunar and Suikoden where position of your units have real value. There are a lot of different ways to optimize each character with skills and customizable equipment, offering a great deal of potential variety and allowing you to create your own strategies and gameplay style. The story really caught me off guard, going in a direction that most media isn't willing to. It caught me off guard a couple times, a big point in its favor to me.  If you are a serious RPG player, make sure to play it on Hard difficulty. At this level, battles actually require strategy and thought. Later in the game, you may find yourself getting the swing of things and going on cruise control, but don't get too comfortable. Even well-leveled and with high-end crafted gear (which takes some work to get), the end game presents a reasonable challenge.  One other point worth mentioning: the amount of backstory presented in this game is huge. There is a lore catalog that you can choose to read if you so desire, and the amount of world building put into this game is impressive.  There are still some minor bugs, but judging by the frequency of updates thus far, the creator is addressing them as they are brought up (including things like balance issues, which is above and beyond as far as I am concerned).",

            "review_text": "A truly polished and mastered game. Dancing Dragon's best RPG yet with solely RPG Maker. Sure there might be some reused resources but clearly the UI and battle systems have been reworked and expanded on from Skyborn to the point it barely resembles conventional RPGs given the implementation of the grid system for a tactical dimension. I am just too pleased with this and the studio deserves more than just a pat on the back or cookies - they deserve PUMPKIN SPICE!  As a filthy casual and non-curator, I have nothing much to say but I will repeat my accolades and so : THANK YOU FOR THIS GAME YOU AMAZING STUDIO THAT USES RPGMAKER YOU!",

            "review_text": "Pros:  - fast paced storyline which hooks you from the start  - fun and rewarding combat system with a plethora of possibilities to customize your characters  - no random encounters: most of the times you can actually see enemies and decide whether to engage them in combat or avoid them.   Cons:  - only ONE BIG CON for me: playing with a pad is a horrible experience. If you play with mouse and keyboard and love rpg then you should buy the game right now. But I play only with a Xbox one pad and moving around characters who can only go up, down, left or right with an analog stick is way too uncomfortable. That's the only reason I stopped playing this game and will not play any more rpg maker games. Please consider moving to a more recent engine like unity or whatever, I'm not an expert in the field, but I'm certain that with your talent you could do wonders if not constrained by the rpg maker engine limitations.",

EXPANSION :The game is played in 'missions' - and you have a 'home base' that changes after each mission is completed. You can talk to characters to get to know them better, upgrade your equipment and things like that. I  really  liked the way they did this - it made sure the game universe was e  *CONS* - Cheesy romance   EXPANSION : Sorry, but the romance between the two characters in this game was a bit too forced for me. It happens far too quickly - and isn't realistic at all.  Honestly, another classic - it takes a little bit to get into (it starts off on a shaky foot)...but really pulls you in once you're past the first 30-40 minutes!",
