It took 10 seconds to go from one option to another as the game slooooooowly transitioned between things. It was so bad I loaded up FRAPS to record it. But then it started working fine, so I closed FRAPS and went back to playing, but it was slowed down again. After some experimenting with it, I figured out the game ACTUALLY RUNS MORE SMOOTHLY when FRAPS is recording video of it.  This game was obviously made by witches and you should not support the dark arts.",
