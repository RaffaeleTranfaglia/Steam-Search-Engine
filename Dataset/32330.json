            "review_text": "This is my favorite 'early' Lego game. Now, with LOTR, POTC, and Batman 2, these games have complex 'hub worlds' and hundreds of collectables of different sorts. This game, Star Wars, and Batman (1) were the original Lego games with a bunch of characters, 10 minikit pieces per level, and not much else. They seem basic compared to games like Lego LOTR, but this game, Indiana Jonse 1, was the best of the original lego games. It has the best level design, a broad selection of the characters you'd want, a great soundtrack, and a general sense of completeness. It has everything you'd want in a Lego Indy game (if you are not a big Crystal Skull fan--which I am not). Some things about this game that are different from other early Lego games: You can pick up weapons (a fallen foe's scimitar, a native's spear, a Nazi's rifle). It adds variety to mashing the fight button. The game makes good use of Indy's whip. It also reminds you of how great all three individual soundtracks were, and the difference between them. Highly recommended for the casual player or devoted collector-type. :)",

            "review_text": "First time I played this was on PS2. I handle discs very well, but my console seemed a bit hungry. The CD's surface had more scratches than a McDonald's bathroom mirror. Never again will this be an issue, now that we have digital download.  On a different note, Lego doesn't typically put this on sale so you'll either wait another year after reading this or you could just buy it now and enjoy.  And in case anyone's wondering, the game supports the following: Xbox 360 controling, 1080p at 60 FPS, Vsync, and whatever additional graphics options it allows. In other words, it runs better than vanilla Dark Souls. :P",

            "review_text": "  Great game. More like the classic lego star wars games than the new lego formats and i'm much more into that format. I 100%'d it and so far at the time of writing this i've 100%'d 5 lego games.  In Order: Lego Star Wars 1 Lego Star Wars 2 Lego Star Wars The Complete Saga Lego Batman 1 And lastly this one. I would have 100%'d this one before Batman 1 but for some reason there was a weird game breaking bug that randomly decided to fix itself after I reinstalled it so thanks I guess.   I have about 15 lego games to at the time of writing this but i'll bump it to 17 if I ever get a WiiU and get Lego City Undercover and if I ever buy Lego Dimensions (but tbh that seems like a massive waste a money and i'll prob just wait till it goes down in price massively)  Probably gonna move on to Lego Indiana 2.  Anyways I get this wasn't much of a review but in a nutshell yes its a good game and if you like Lego games especially the classic ones its great. Also if you're a controller user there's some massive bugs with emulated controllers so you will need an Xbox 360 controller. Apparently a lot of lego games on PC have this problem for some reason.",
