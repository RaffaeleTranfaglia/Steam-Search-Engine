The developer is very responsive and fixed the problem I had with the track disappearing in less than 1 hour. It is perfect for parties and seeing people having a lot of fun when they try this ride, one of the first things I will show to family and friends in the future.  I like to support the VR devs in these early days of VR they spend their time in creating stuff for us without earning much! ",
