            "review_text": "PixelJunk Monsters Ultimate is a tower defense game that requires constant attention from the player. You play as a Tiki guy defending a hut from waves of monsters. On the surface, it seems like a cheerful casual game... but looks can be deceiving. There are almost never any lulls in the action, so you always have to be on the move, planning ahead. Resources (used to build towers) come in the form of coins dropped from enemies. However, you actually have to run around and collect the coins yourself before they disappear. Similarly, in order to build towers, you actually have to walk to where you want them first. Towers can also be upgraded by standing on them, a process that takes time. Enemies also sometimes drop crystals, which can be spent to quickly upgrade towers, or saved up to purchase other types of towers. So gameplay boils down to a test of multitasking skills - you have to balance anticipating what towers need to be built (and where), while simultaneously collecting dropped resources and upgrading. It gets pretty intense.  Most levels can be completed easily enough in 1 or 2 tries, but the challenge comes in trying to do so perfectly (not letting even 1 enemy get to your hut). Perfect-scoring levels unlocks more levels to play, and so on. And that's where the challenge (and unfortunately, frustration) comes in. The main down-side to this game is that it can sometimes be very unfair. While there is an indicator that shows what types of enemies are coming up, it's not always clear enough (for example, a blinking red icon sometimes means 'weak to cannons', and other times 'on fire and 3 times as fast'). Also, sometimes enemies take completely different paths with no warning. These types of things are frankly just bad game design and complete BS. The best TD games allow you to deduce the path enemies will take and plan ahead accordingly. This game doesn't always do that, which leads to having to sometimes rely on memorization rather than actual skill. Thankfully, it doesn't happen a lot, but that doesn't make it any less frustrating when it does. That said, this is a small complaint when compared to how good the rest of the game is, but it is a noteworthy enough issue that it needed to be mentioned.  The main game consists of 47 levels, with an additional 24 challenge levels that can be unlocked. The challenges are levels that have to be cleared while also fulfilling some sort of special criteria (completing challenges unlocks concept art, videos, music and more). The game also has a 2-player co-op mode, which I haven't tried (but it seems like it would be really fun). All in all, between the main levels, challenges, and co-op, the amount of content available is pretty substantial. I've sunk around 60 hours in already (though technically, most of that was spent replaying levels over and over again trying to get perfect clears), but still, the fact that I put that much time into it speaks to how good the core gameplay is. Despite my rant above on the few down-sides that sometimes make it frustrating, overall, the game is solid, and lots of fun to play. If you like tower defense, this is a great one. The price seems a bit high, especially when the original version on PS3 was cheaper, but there is also more content in this version compared to the original release, plus the added multiplayer component... so I suppose it is probably justified. If you are into TD games, definitely pick it up in a sale at some point, if not at full price.",

There is a very nice degree of balance between all the enemy units and your various towers and their upgrades. Each level has a different path to victory, and comes with fresh visuals.",

You play a little tiki guy (1 or 2 player) and you use trees to build towers on as ground units/flying units/shielded units/fast units/etc try to get to the end and eat your friends. Your towers level up by killing monsters but you can dance on them to level them up faster. Guessing: there are over 30 stages included in this game along w/ a bunch of challenges (stages with unique requirements to win). When you complete the game a new island unlocks that is basically a random stage generator. It will randomly generate a stage and monsters for you to play on.  You should buy this.",

It's better played on a controller, since you need to be fast, you will control the guy to make towers, you will need to walk to a tower if you want to upgrade it, and will need to touch the gold and other resource to get it, and if a enemy touches you, you will drop in the ground for a bit and lose some coins, but you can easily get them back.  You will need to be fast, manage well your resources and plan the upgrades and next resources against the upcoming waves.",

        {
            "review_text": "There is no doubt in my mind that you need this game, if you're into tower defense games. If you don't like tower defense games, then avoid this at all costs, because that's what this is, but that's not /all/ this is.  A set wave of enemies will spawn and attack your home base where your children are helplessly hoping they make it alive from the Monsters, but not unless you save them, then peace will be restored (a typical layout for a tower defense game, but Pixeljunk takes it further than that). You get a large variety of bad-a$$ towers to choose from like fire towers, ice towers, laser towers, arrow towers, cannon towers, and much more to take down your enemies. Around half the towers you use are to be unlocked by beating other levels. A rewarding experience to unlock the new towers and watch at how powerfully you can blast through a previous level to try to obtain a perfect score, unlocking new levels to ultimately, unlock even more content. The amount of replayability to this game goes on a whole 'nother scale of 'awesome'. What Pixeljunk Monsters does, is it gives you a standard tower defense game layout, and create an enlightening charm, creative ideas, and personality that cannot easily be replicated.   Just like I like to tell people about Serious Sam (very unrelated game) is that the enemies and sheer creativity given to them makes the game memorable. Another trait that both games have in common is that you learn to acknowledge the sound of your enemy. Whether it be knowing what's coming (Serious Sam) or knowing what you've just killed (PJ Monsters) hearing the sounds of your enemy is only accomplishing if you begin to love the characters you're decimating.   This Steam release does feel rather lacking, now here's where things get more in-depth.  PJ Monsters feels more like a Steam port than an ultimate HD re-master. There's a new map that 'randomly generates levels', but this is actually nothing more than the game on 'shuffle' as it gives you a random map from the game and changes few things like enemy spawns and location textures. The maps are exclusively the same otherwise. The game does look remarkable in HD on a monitor, and saying this without playing the original PS3 version, I feel as if it's probably not too different from how it looked on there. In fact, the game being in 'HD' should be a given, and not an announcement. The game isn't old. Regardless of their showing off 'High Definition', the game looks nice, plays nice, plays right, and plays fair.  They do give you Steam trading cards, which is probably the best feature added to this Steam port. They include descriptions of what you're fighting, and if you collect them all you can share your love of the game to your friends by showing off your pride with your PJ Monsters badge.  Did I mention co-op though? The co-op feature to this game on Steam is undenyably the best way to play. Get a friend to buy the game, or purchase the two-in-one bundle and blast through these baddies with strategic planning, mapping, and basically any other skill you can accomplish in a game of tower defense, with a friend! (I think the maximum was eight players at a time, but I don't have enough friends who play this and the Steam page doesn't explain co-op for the game too well as of this review, so I cannot say for certain).  Overall, I feel like with this release there could have been a little more content (I think if they revised the randomly generated levels to actually be randomly generated that would be enough for me) would have been nice. The game delivers what you'd expect and the charm of this game is enough to play it alone. It's not scary, it's not hyper, it's not angry, it's just happy and fun.   9.6/10",
