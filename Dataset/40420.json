    "description": "Tidalis is a block-based puzzle game with casual appeal, hardcore depth, and an addictive new &quot;streams&quot; mechanic. The game is brimming over with riffs and variants on that core mechanic with 20 game modes, dozens of special blocks and items, and 115 levels in the adventure mode alone.",

            "review_text": "An interesting casual puzzle game. A little like Tetris but much deeper. Its basic rule is to eliminate 3 blocks of the same colors. The difference is that the block is directional. Player have to adjust the direction of every block to chain the stream through as more blocks as possible. When a set of blocks is eliminated, one or more new streams appear to connect more blocks of different colors. The more sets of blocks are eliminated continuously, the more the combos are. This mechanics makes this game deep, complicated and engrossing. This game uses many different conditions to limit player's move, thus making it much more challenging. Finally, the background music is beautiful. Recommend if you just wanna relax peacefully.",

            "review_text": "Kind of a mess.  It's a little misleading when people compare this game to Bejeweled or Tetris in any sense that suggests it might be a 'clone' of one of those games. Yes, blocks drop in from the top of the screen and are arranged in a grid, but that just sets it in the same genre as those other games. Several people have referred to the game as 'Match-3' and that's an extremely far-reaching interpretation of the term.  To be honest, I thought that the core mechanic of this game was actually pretty interesting at first: Clicking a block fires a little energy stream, and the energy will travel to like-colored blocks a short distance away, continuing in a chain and redirecting based on the direction of the arrows on the blocks as the energy arrives. If a chain includes 3 or more blocks, those blocks are destroyed, points are scored, and there is potential for cascades. The player must manually rotate individual blocks in order to specify the path of the energy stream; doing so before beginning the stream makes it easier to manage.  The problem is that it gets boring very quickly - or, more accurately, it fails to hold interest. It's not so much that it's boring to play, but it's chaotic and it starts to feel very arbitrary . You scan the board, looking to determine which color of block has the best potential for a big combo, then you start arranging your combo; all the while more blocks are being dropped in from the top of the board. You fire off your stream, and it travels around over so much of the board that you can't really do much to set up another color while this one is in progress, and you just hope that the rest of the blocks are already arranged in a way that will give you a lucky cascade. As you get used to the game, you may get more adept at planning out deeper combos in advance, which I suppose is what they refer to when they call this game 'casual appeal, hardcore depth', but even if you're good, there's an inherent clumsiness in clicking and dragging to change the direction of the arrows on these little tiles.  The game does offer a wide variety of variant modes and special blocks. I don't particularly enjoy most of them, but I appreciate the work that went into adding them, and I like the fact that they can be used in conjunction with one another. Unfortunately, it's very easy to make the game exponentially more chaotic in this way, especially considering the game has a 'randomizer' option that switches on any number of modes and special blocks.  Music and SFX are okay, but they get a little grating after a while. Many of the sounds that play are little jingles, and they can be dissonant with the music depending on when they play. It's especially unpleasant when you set off several combos at once, as it plays a separate instance of the SFX for each combo, all layering on top of each other along with the music. It's a bit much. The art is okay, though the characters and creatures are a little on the grotesque side. Some of the background images are very nice, but you don't really get a chance to pay attention to them while you're playing the game. One of the more jarring visual elements comes when a level ends. A high-saturation color overlay is placed over the screen, either in green (for winning) or red (for losing), along with some screenshake and little firework effects.  If you are at all concerned about your Steam achievement average, then I would skip this game entirely. You're almost guaranteed an achievement your first session (there's one for winning and one for losing), and there are LOTS of achievements that deal in long grinding and super high scores (100 million points in a single combo?). It's possible to set up a custom stage that will just generate nonstop combos, if you don't want to play for hundreds of hours. Also be aware that even if you earn an achievement, it won't be awarded to you until the level ends.  It's an interesting idea, but I don't think it's strong enough to stand on its own All the modifiers and custimization may add a little novelty, but not enough to save it.",

From simply avoiding something, tu utterly despising powerups and loving bad items. A whole new experience. I truly reccomend it.",

Don't think twice, just buy it. You won't regret it, honest. For outperforming everything else in this genre, I give it four out of four blocks.",

You mean I can match this one color by switching around arrows? Sweet! It is a little tricky to get the hang of especially when they start throwing in the 'special' blocks. Once you get it though, you feel smart and improved. I think the little ditty that plays after you break blocks is really what seals the deal.   If you like match'ems but want something different, this game is worth giving a shot.",
