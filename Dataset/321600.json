This game has nothing to do with the Flying Dutchman. - Graphics are blurry and some items can't be seen at all. You WILL be using the hint button. - Quite a few items are misspelled and some aren't even accurate. You WILL be using the hint button. - The hint button takes forever to recharge. - Music in no way reflects the pirate theme. But if you like Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairies... - They ask for the same items over and over so after a bit, there's no challenge at all. - Game is extremely short. Actually, this could be considered a pro.  Please don't spend your money on this game. It's one of the worst things I've played.",

            "review_text": "I could forgive the spelling mistakes, since it seems like English is not the game developers' native language. However, the game suffers from several flaws that make this (thankfully short) experience pretty painful. For a 'hidden object' game, the picture quality is atrocious, as if the game assets were saved as low-quality jpegs. Some of the objects you're asked to find are ambigous, such as being asked to find a 'bird', but only one of the four birds on the scene will actually count. Other times, the objects are completely mislabelled, like being asked to find a 'duck' when they mean 'swan', or being asked to find a 'flute' when they really mean 'grasshopper'.  There's only really 6 scenes in total in this game, but the game forces you to replay the scenes over and over as a form of padding, I guess in an attempt to stretch out the game. It doesn't work: Once you've found the pelican the first time around, it's really not that hard to find the same pelican at the same exact location the 2nd, 3rd and 4th time you're asked to replay that scene.  I bought the game at 50 cents, and I'd say it was just barely worth it for the laughs, in the 'so bad it's good' sense.",
