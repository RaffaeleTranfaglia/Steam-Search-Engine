            "review_text": "If I'm being honest, this game is worth far more than the 3 dollar price tag. You can actually PLAY the game, and it has steam trading cards, which will allow you to earn some interesting emoticons/backgrounds. The kickass remix on the title screen is all I needed to get hyped.  Although this game is obviously a joke, I've still had quite a lot of fun already and don't regret buying it. I'm sure you won't either, as it only costs you the lunch money your parents gave you. This game stays in your library forever, whereas the food you bought at the cafetaria only lasts for a couple hours.  All hail our lord and savior of vidya, GabeN! (PS: my favorite class is the pie)",

Don't listen to the others; they're all negative nancies. Trust your inner-greed, that overwhelming lust and succumb to GabeN's holy presense.   While yes, Gabe Newell Simulator is a game, it is trully an expierence that any loyal follower of GabeN's should try out.   7.9/10 = worth the wait.",

There's also the final room (which you can enter from the menu without beating the game) with only a computer and you can decide if you want to release or delete hl3, there will be adequate video ending played.  Betwen these there are 5 levels where nothing happens, you run through same empty corridors, passing same enemies (they run even slower than Gaben, shooting in this game is pointless).  Oh and there is Portal DLC: 3 levels, in the end you reach a cake and nothing happens, ESC doesn't work, you have to ALT+F4. So rewarding.  Played almost an hour, still haven't received one trading card.",
