Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad game per se, the idea is rather nice and game design is okay, but you WILL get mad at this game A LOT, because almost every feature is rough around the edges. Movement? Yup. Object interaction? Yup. Failing mission because a guard noticed you just as the bullet was saying hi to his brain? Totally. Unable to open Pause menu by pressing Escape? Uh-huh, you're stuck here until Alt+F4. Also, this game might have been more fun to play despite all its flaws, probably, but what we end up with is rather generic and repetetive as well. It doesn't make the game terrible. It just makes the game 'meh'.",

            "review_text": "Clandestine: ~~~~~~~~~~    It is 1996 and the cold war ended five years ago. Strangely, veterans from both the CIA and FSB are rapidly being found permanently terminated under rather curious circumstances. This prompts both agencies to create a new bureau in the attempt to find out who is behind this trail of eradicated veteran operatives!  Clandestine is a stealth/action/hacking type of game where you play a team of two, shall we say two newbies promoted to the arena of super spies. You will play Katya Kozlova and Martin Symborsky, Katya will be the field operative with a very light armoury (a PKK and her hand to hand combat ability) and will need to rely on stealth. Martin will be in the van hacking computer systems and taking control of camera surveillances to help her through each level.   I really enjoy the way you can quickly change from a 3rd person view (Katya) to the hacking control system (Martin) by pressing one button. Essentially, the hacking system is divided in four on your screen: The first part is the console which will show you dialogue and objectives; the second one is the camera feeds where you can take control of a specific camera and study the area around it (enemy movements) or going through undetected; The third is the network view, the hacking system, this is where you send your Node to bypass firewalls, take over computers and even surcharge electric boxes to create an explosion. Time it when a foe is next to it and you will take him down. The fourth is the tactical view which will give you the layout of the level as well as show you where the cameras and computers are placed.  On the solo mode, you can choose from four levels of difficulty. They have put a bit of humour here where the easy level is Bond (007) and the extra hard level is Leon. Also, make sure you gather Intel’s as you will get additional points at the end of the mission for doing so. There is a Co-op mode if you like to play with one of your friend.  Graphics are average but that should not bother you if you like to play a great stealth game. Voice over could have been better too but the controls are good and easy to learn.  Positives: ~~~~~~~   - Solid stealth game with hacking concept - Controls are easy to learn - Solo and co-op mode - Achievements &amp; Trading cards  Negatives: ~~~~~~~~   - Average graphics - Voice over could have been better  This is a really solid stealth/action game with an excellent hacking phase which made it really fun to play.   8/10  Key provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

            "review_text": "Clandestine is a unique, innovative, and engaging co-op stealth game. While it was clearly made on a small budget, and potentially limited game design experience ( I don't know these things, I'm just guessing ) it shines as a very unique, memorable experience when played with a buddy.  Story feels rather forgettable, and the NPCs all look really strange - I kept making fun of this one guy who looked like a Sim from the Sims 2 - but there are some fun parts in what I've seen. The dialouge seems rather dynamic, and the NPCs will react to how your missions go down and some other small things - My friend wandered into the men's restroom in the hub area, for instance, and when he went to talk to the big boss guy he asked that they please refrained from doing so.  ...The spy is female, for those unaware.  The characters will either compliment or berate you based on your performance in the missions - How lethal you were, or how much of a trace you left. Some of them have different overall desires in how you handle things, but I don't think it affects anything aside from dialog.  One thing I noticed is that later missions may get harder if you leave more evidence. It was brought up during a mission briefing that the security on the level would be low, because the previous mission was so flawless they just assumed it was an inside job, and that there was no reason to step up security.  The gameplay, while unrefined in some ways, is very unique and engaging. Controlling the Spy feels clunky and awkward at times, but you can get the job done easily. The Hacker works like a charm, though, which is impressive considering how they manage and keep track of four different windows.   If you want more specifics, read other reviews - But I have to say that this is a big recommend - If you get a friend. The solo seems just a little too scatterbrained with switching between hacker and spy. And if you get a friend, you should probably keep in mind if they would like the Hacker or the Spy, and what you would rather play yourself. A scatterbrained hacker is not something you want or need.  I recommend Clandestine to anyone who enjoys co-operative stealth games that require some planning, and a bit of experimentation.",

            "review_text": "Let me preface this with a disclaimer: If you hold appreciation or amusement for the culture of the 90's then you'll love this game, if you're too young to know or remember much of them this game probably isn't for you.   Being the former this was one big nostalgia trip which involved a lot of 'WOWWWWW' and laughter; dev's really nailed the immersion and level design. I probably spent 40 minutes or so just running around the agency building marvelling at it all.   Had this game been set in a more modern era I would deride the absolute ♥♥♥♥ out of it for being a terrible waste of money. In my honest opinion the AI and stealth is mediocre, the guns and gunplay are ♥♥♥♥, your gadgets are ♥♥♥♥, controls are ♥♥♥♥, the 'social engineering' is shallow if you give it so much as a second glance and the graphics are atrocious. Unreal 3, anyone? Now 4? What about Unity 4 and now 5? These kind of graphics really aren't excusable for this kind of genre.  All that said though, whether by design or luck, it all ties into and feeds off each other to create something entirely 90's. Those clunky controls, bad guns and gadgets, the dumb AI, that fairly bad voice acting and occassionally buggy cutscenes. This ♥♥♥♥ is glorious, when I play I feel like I'm playing a game in the 90's (Realtalk: It plays how games back then worked when thinking back with nostalgia, not how terrible they are when you actually try). When there's a cutscene, I'm so interested in what's going on it practically feels like a movie from that era. The emails you hack and read? 90's. The stuff laying about that you can read? 90's. The speech, the clothes, the stereotypes all of it 90's.  What really brings this game together in the end is the sheer amount of detail put into the levels, the dev's clearly put in a lot of care and attention to get everything just right and without that everything else would have fallen flat. Poking around and just looking at things takes up most of my gameplay.   As it is, I think 25 USD is a more than fair asking price.",

Terrible mouse input, Average story. Good gameplay - mixture of Stealth, Action and Puzzeling elements. I don't care about graphics but they are ♥♥♥♥ anyway. Coop works fine no need for third party programs - recommended by the way. AI isn't that bad. Very, very... short campaign (about 5h, way shorter if you rush it and are actually good) and no replay value apart if you want to change roles up for a second playthrough.  All in all a average game, but from a technical standpoint it's a mess.",

You can be either a hacker and infiltrator and the other role you do not chose will be either a computer player or hopefully a friend.   Hacking segment reminds me of Deus Ex Human revolution where you have to avoid detection from anti virus programs but everything is in real time as the world around you doesn't stop because you are hacking, the other player might of just ran off somewhere else when you were doing that. Communication is key as any mulitplayer game but a live chat is essential in this game.   The infiltrator part of the game mechanic is similar to all the other infiltratotion sneaking game except killing people doesn't seem to have much of a negative consequences (hopefully will address in full game?) so I just ended up going into a building shooting everyone in the head leaving bloody masscure behind me.   The story for me wasn't very memoriable and wasn't intriguing enough to grab my attention or invest in, and this was same for the characters.   If there was a meh~ button other than thumbs up and thumbs down I would of given exactly that. For what it is now, I wouldn't recommend unless you are very desperate to play a co-op game with your buddy for few hours max",

Couldnt get past the second level even on the easiest mode, the game lags even though my pc meets the reccommended requirements, also when playing as the stealth character the movement only lets you move in 8 directions = it feels really blocky and makes moving around difficult. You can only hug SOME walls, and you can only vault over SOME objects, It also doesnt tell you how much ammo you have, give you a map, or anything. The mouse sensitivity is also very low with no option to turn it up. overall, awesome concept, very poor execution. Really hope the devs update it and fix all this someday. 4/10",
