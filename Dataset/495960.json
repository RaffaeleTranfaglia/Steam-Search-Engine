I got this game as part of a bundle, but would never pay full price for a short game like this.  The premise is good, the art is cute, the interface... is ok (but being unable to click on anything in the upper 3rd of the screen because the inventory bar pops out is really annoying). But by far my biggest gripe is how short this game is, and how most of your time is spent walking back and forth between places.  Fix the bar, make the chapters at minimum 2x longer, add a skip feature (spacebar) to long walks/repeat dialogue, and if this game is intended for small children, please say so.",
