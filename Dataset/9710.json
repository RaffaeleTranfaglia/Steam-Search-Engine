    "description": "Desperados 2 is the sequel to the successful wild west title Desperados - Wanted Dead or Alive. The gameplay is based on its predecessor but with brand new tactical possibilities in a beautiful 3D environment. Switch from an isometric view to a third person view whenever you want; for example, for duels, brawls and shoot-outs.",
