Yes, you cant play forever a day at first(with one character), but honestly, upward lvl 60(that you can reach in 3 days with current events) your Fatigue just runs out soooooo slow, its already past midnight and you still got that feeling that you need to get ♥♥♥♥ done(with the same character you started playing this morning). +Great, helpful Community, people from all over the Internet are playing it, be it the leddit army, the 5chin F4Gs, or just your mom, secretly. +Updates just keep on coming, seems like some people really spend a ton of money, God bless the whales. +PvP is great, theres Tourneys in Korea, its like a beat-em-up.  Cons: -Sometimes you cant decide which class to play next, because everything is kinda cool. -Unless you find a nice Guild, it can get boring alone. Finding a Guild is just one click away, and people are randomly asking you too. -Again the Fatigue Point system, but only for your first day of playing. From the second day onward, you can play with your favourite Character the whole day.  TL:DR: From my Perspective, its one of the best F2P games out here on Steam. And i played like, all of the ♥♥♥♥ing free2uninstall MMOs out there. Like seriously, all of them. Like a MMORPG list, i played ♥♥♥♥ing all of them. And this game got me.",

Pros:  - beautiful sprites - REALLY REALLY REALLY GOOD BGM, you can look up dfo OST to see some examples - lots of different classes to play - lots dungeons to play  - unique and loveable character designs  - Storyline is pretty cool lol - frequent events that give out cash shop goodies  - The game devs keep in constant communication with the players, really nice people  Cons: - Community isn't very great like most MMOs, lots of sarcastic ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that want the game to die and yet they still play everyday, a couple of scammers here and there and self centered losers that think they should be rewarded greatly for little effort - takes some dedication to get good endgame gear - Avatars are generally 'cash shop only' but there are events that hand out avatars once in awhile, avatar packages are tradable and can be bought from players but will cost a lot of gold (gold to CERA ratio, etc..) - a fatigue system that discourages people from 'no-lifing' the game, also encourages you to play other characters - Grinding can get a little monotonous when you get to the point where you have multiple capped characters, after all this is an asian game, lots and lots of grinding!   I recommend to join a guild as there are people willing to help out new players, it is also a good way to make friends in this game.   theres probably some others I missed out but If you are willing to take the challenge and play DFO for awhile, you may see why this game is so popular in Asia and continue playing with the rest of the NA community.",

            "review_text": "I like this game since It first came out back in the Nexon Era. Post Nexon-Era no other game really felt the same like dungeon fighter until it was brought back by the devs themself. And I joined the Alpha testing servers to re-experience the gaming experience that brought me into MMO's. The combat is fast paced and fluid and the variety of moves and classes there are just makes each character feel really refreshing and unique. The artsyle despite the whole 'play your anime world!' slogan is actually pretty good in its own way. Sure there are anime aspects to it but overall the designs are really good.  --Incoming wall of text so get ready for quite the read if you're really indecisive about this game, TL:DR just give it a try and see how you like it, otherwise these are just me explaining certain things that will turn beginner players away that aren't properly explained by the game itself--  Now a few things to note first and foremost: This game as an Energy (Fatigue) System. And there's a reason for that: in Korea to limit how much to play in consideration for someone's health etc. but you can easily just create more characters to keep playing if you're just that in love with the game. Now I've played this game for countless hours so to finally see it back on steam with Neople now I just wanted to give it a good word.  Again the Fatigue system is going to turn off you and a lot of new players and there are ways to counter it with characters, but the game also provides you with ways to restore your Fatigue Points with in-game potions you can use once a day. And Neople has events all the time so if you follow some of them they give you cash shop items that EXTEND your maximum fatigue so you'll have more than you know what to do with.  The FP system also helps combat against gold bots. I mean if you log into DFO and compare it to any (korean) MMO you'll see the difference with how many players the game is filled with vs naked bots flooding common areas. Sure 1 or 2 sneak through the system but neople acts fast to getting rid of them  ---whew- Okay technical junk aside that i know most newbies complain about, lets get to how I feel about the game and this is going to be somewhat biased but bear with me here (haha bear pun)  1.This game has that retro-arcade action feeling in it's gameplay and the gameplay just varies so much. It can be fast paced inputting skills to get off a combo to do massive damage or just using an 1 click AoE spell and watching with joy the havoc you're dealing or maybe it's a bit of both depending on which class you make. The gameplay just boils down to 'How fast can you kill this thing without it killing you' but it's not always like that. Most of the lore/story is text-based so you know how in quests it's just 'I need help go do this for me'. Well in this case it is but isn't this. The game gives you a mini intro on the character you picked which shows their 'backstory'. Ultimatey you embark on this quest and it leads you to many different places. You could care for the lore or not but it's definitely worth the read when you piece things together and are a big lover of stories. There are a bit weird grammatical or translation errors but you can make out what they generally mean.  2.Yes this game does have in-game transactions via Cash Shop, but I managed to do fine without spending a single dollar on the game. Remember Neople throws out events all the time so chances are, half the event rewards are cash items that you can get or maybe even event exclusive so get on those. Also there are people in-game who DO sell the ingame cash currency 'Cera' for in-game gold and the players in the community have collectively agreed to doing this because a player bought the Game Card that supports the devs so it's win/win. Person A gets the gold they need. Person B gets the cash currency they want. And the Devs are supported by Person A's cash  3.Also note MOST cash item stuff is just inventory/cosmetics. There's another thing which which DOES grants stats but the stats are pretty miniscule compared to what you'll be getting in-game so it's all just a teeny tiny boost is all.  4. If you think 'Ugh I have to make Alternate characters just to keep playing this game, i'm done' don't because believe it or not this game has 30+ classes with unique playstyles so if anything this game encourages making alts because there are many playstyles out there to play and try out and have fun with. (And the korean devs are STILL pumping out content how cool is that???)  In conclusion this is just the basic things that turn beginners away because yeah, upfront in your face. All that stuff does seem gross, but if you give it time then it becomes really enjoyable.",

I was mainly a league of legends player, ever since I played this game on July 30 2015, I got hooked and league took barely 20 percent of my time if not less. This game is very addicting as it has the smoothest and deepest beat-em-up gameplay I have ever seen, with over 40 distinct classes, and mind you they DELIVER with their themes! This game fills me with testosterone, man! If you love any of the following: Hack and Slash, Beat em Up, Action RPG, Fighting games; do not pass up this game, it is the third most popular free PC game in the east for a reason. Personally I LOVE having skills be interactive in an MMO where your positioning and fighting-esque combos determine how you handle the monsters rather than 'press skill, deal damage, keep auto attacking until it dies' One of the best games I have ever played. I would even compare it to Castlevania, Megaman and TMNT when it comes to side scrolling action, look no further as you have just found the king of the genre. Bonus: This game has amazing soundtrack~",

            "review_text": "I can't believe I just played this game for more than 8 hours straight.. Always wanted to pick this game up when it came out but couldn't because  Nexon blows  of regional restrictions..  and a high resentment towards Nexon NA in general (for good reason).  Though 8 hours may not be a lot for this game I think it suffices to write a first impression. I can't imagine the rest of the game to be that much different anyway.  It's a pretty typical 'Korean' MMO; take that as you will. After choosing from a diversity of interesting classes, the game starts out with a nice class-based intro. But then it slowly descends into your usual endless chain of quests with a story and dialogue that's even less compelling than my grandma's diary. I quickly found myself skipping through it because not only does it feel dragged out and trivial; it often pops up untimely, interrupting the pace or obnoxiously obscuring the reward screen. Having never played this game before, it's a bit overwhelming when the game presents you with NPCs and a crapload variety of items that you're not familiar with. And that's probably what you'll be going through for at least major part of the game.  The game does feature a fatigue/stamina system which some may think is awful. I don't find it to be that much of an obstacle (yet) unless you really want to focus on just progressing one character. That said, the game does encourage playing multiple characters for bonuses. Fatigue is separated between characters and seems to be pretty lenient but it's still a limit to your gameplay per character.  But a Korean MMO is of course nothing without it's obligatory cash shop filled to the brim with items that make your DFO life easier and cosmetics that cost more than your wallet is willing to spend. Due to lack of further knowledge regarding the game's mechanics, I won't cry out P2W.. but it really wouldn't come as a surprise if many of the available items are. And that basically sums up my most prominent gripes with the game.  Because in spite of all the above, it's a really fun brawler. The controls are tight and feel very good for the fast-paced/spamfest combat. The sprites and animations are superb and the flashy huge skills really makes combat feel like an over the top scene from an anime out of your wildest dreams. Paired with a banging soundtrack to boot, it makes for a very enjoyable experience. And truthfully, that should be the most important aspect/biggest reason to play this game.  I haven't dabbled in multiplayer yet as I find the singleplayer experience (so far) to be more than satisfying. The servers are located in the US but from my understanding MP seems to be P2P which can be a nuisance when playing with people from other regions. That's about all I can say about it, as I don't care for looking more into it until I (want to) get there.  So in conclusion, I'd say it's a F2P that's definitely worth a try.",

            "review_text": "A very interesting revival of an old time MMO favorite. Granted, the grind in end game is still atrocious but manageable if you've been through other F2P titles such as Warframe, Blade and Soul or Guild Wars 2. While armor sets such as Dark Gothic and so forth may take up to 250,000 demonic invites ( a rather expensive method of accessing end game content ), Neople showed no fear towards awarding players in their journey towards having BiS status for all their slots.   While, I would certainly prefer to grind a lot less than that, a game without a challenging end game is a dead game. Though if I were Neople, I'd find ways to prolong replayability rather than potentially following the same formula every MMO has followed = intense gear grinding. Otherwise, enjoy a blazing leveling speeds to max level where the pain truly begins. Like I mentioned before, a grindy game is still a grindy game but in comparison to other incredibly successful games such as Warframe or even Guild Wars 2? I think putting this title down because of that factor just isn't fair.   I would recommend this game for F2P veterans and players that absolutely like this type of progress but I will not recommend players that want a more casual, non grindy end game. If I could give this game a neutral response, I certainly would as Neople is a company that's improving in general, showing much more promise than their publisher: Nexon who pratically murders original developer titles.",

            "review_text": "Long time player here, I have followed DFO since it's Nexon days. Have been there since Nexon's beta phase, to full release, through the eventual closure, then it's reopening under Neople. It will never cease to amaze me that the current team at Neople (11 employees) has done such so much more for the game than Nexon ever has.  But what is this game? The best way to describe Dungeon Fighter Online is that it is a side-scrolling beat-em up RPG, that also happens to have MMO elements in it.  Dungeon Fighter Online is a fantastic game to come back and play at the end of the day, when you just unwind, and beat up hordes of enemies with flashy skills. And boy does DFO do it well. Heavy weapons, ghostly possession, bare fists, DFO has a little something for everyone. This is backed up by the massive character roster, with each individual character subclasses having at least 20 unique skills. And if you're a speedrunner like I am, the prospect of running dungeons faster and faster keeps me coming back. While it is marketed as an MMO, partying and playing with other people is surprisingly optional. Almost all of the content in the game can be tackled and completed on your own, though bringing a friend or two will certainly help. If you're a person who likes their own quiet time, DFO will never force you to party up, to complete the majority of the content.  Of course, being a free-to-play game, DFO employs a cash shop where you can get flashy goodies. An event package, usually being the most economical bang-for-your-buck package, will run at around $28. These packages are can also be sold in the in-game auction hall for in-game currency as well. Other more “important” items, such as inventory expansions, can be completely bought out for less than $5 dollars. These items provided offer minimal benefits to general play, and are often given out for free during events.   However, the game is by no means perfect. There are many reviews that complain about the state of endgame gearing and equipment, which are partially true. Some of the best endgame equipment can only be acquired from a random loot table, which may take several months to find, based on your own pace. However, the developers have taken note that the non-Korean market has a much lower tolerance for these types of grinds, and have systemically lowered the effort needed to acquire such equipment. In addition, extreme endgame content (think on par with Borderlands OP8+) has been continuously been toned down so that such an equipment requirement isn't needed. Apart from the equipment grind, DFO's playstyle mantra is to make smaller chunks of playtime over a longer periods of time.   In short, DFO is still what it is listed as. If you liked sidescrolling action games, give it a try. If you were a fan of the arcades and games like River City Ransom and Streets of Rage, give it a try. If you like dressup... give it a try, but prepare to spend money. If you like to call down orbital lasers on unsuspecting mooks, give it a try. If you're looking for that small bite of action you can come back to every day, give it a try.  Arad awaits you! See you in-game.",

Experience an arcade like gameplay graphics and a VERY upbeat catchy soundtrack, with all the RPG addicting trapings. Including a good continuous story line and plot that makes you feel like your not just stopping all the time to plug in more quarters. SO with the old Double Dragon or Street Fighter feel, looks and combo sound effects of POW, POW, BLAM there is a lot here. Choose from 14 classes first. From Mage to Gunner to Fighter there is something for everyone that uses their own type of combat and equipment and skills. The Demon Lance class was just released and seems pretty popular. Some classes are more beginer friendly then others. Choose wisely whoever fits your gaming tasts. Also realizing that at certain levels in the game you can go into subclasses like Mage/Elemental Bomber or Mage/Glacial. So there is a lot there. Then there is the good ol' equipment and crafting. Crafting in this game is the collection of some type of items to make another. A lot like other RPG games here. Alchemy, enchanting, animation and dessasembly. Choose one though and set up shop, make money and make your gear better! (or in the case of animation, create creatures) The game has lots of events and begining quests, items and new things to help new players or returning ones. Witch make the game fun and your not feeling like your struggling. So with the gameplay you do play through dungeons, that you usually have quests or something to do in them. There is a unique boss at the end of every dungeon. You have to travel through a set of rooms to get to em, with each room full of chests and baddies. Themes and diffrent baddies to these themes are evident in each room and the boss. Your not gonna just have random generated baddies like ''Evil 8 eyed Crab'' in the Desert level. There is also hub cities, were you have the merchants and shops and to find and recruit frineds to help you in the dungeons. All the usual RPG stuff and social aspects of the game. There is a lot to first jump into, but youll pick it up and get addicted rather fast. The game is also all subtitled and the English speaking community is growing.

It is MANDATED by their government that such a system be put in place. And, given the choice between Neople running the game with it in place and Nexon running the game without it... well we all saw how that one worked out didn't we?   So roll more than one character. Hell, the game gives you bonuses for doing so. Not that they don't throw free stuff at you by the truckloads just for playing. There's like...ten different events going on at once. I think I have like, 18 days of premium time I didn't have to pay for. My point is, the Fatigue system is kind of obnoxious, but you can buy potions that can give you more fatigue per day, which you can and will also earn.   The gameplay is solid. You would not believe how smooth this game plays, it's a beat em up lovers dream. Streets of rage, Golden Axe, and Knights of the Round wish they were this cool. The combo system is extensive, but intuitive, and the controls work seamlessly whether you choose to play with a controller or with the keyboard.   I know that sounds a little weird, being that it's an action combo oriented game and I just suggested playing it with the keyboard, but it was actually optimized to work with a keyboard. Keeping in mind the key mapping system is completely open and it really doesn't matter, you can set anything up however you want.   The music ranges from sub par to completely kick ♥♥♥, and the voice work is pretty good, with the AWFUL American dub removed completely. (YOU HAVE TO SPEND MONEY TO MAKE MONEY!!!!)  Let's talk about something else. This game has been around for a while now, it's true, but it has been completely remastered. The artwork is crisp and clean, it looks great on new displays, but the biggest bonus is that the intense, fast, fluid, and responsive gameplay we all fell in love with just got a whole lot tighter. With the upgrade to the graphics, we also see an upgrade to the backend, and the execution of the action is simply flawless. Everything from the run animations to the timing of the actual moves have been tweaked and upgraded to match the revamp in graphics and it shows.   I could not be happier with this release. Neople are good people, and being someone who WORKED with Nexon during the game's prime when they published it, from the bottom of my heart, it's good to see such a quality product back where it belonged in the first place.   Cheers. Play this game. Give it a shot. Give THEM a shot. They're back, and my hope is they are here to stay.",

From the days of Nexon up until now, I've stuck with this game through and through, and no matter how much time I spend away from it, I always end up coming back.  Dungeon Fighter Online is a free-to-play MMORPG action brawler that draws inspiration from beat-em-ups like Double Dragon or Streets of Rage. The game is based almost entirely around PvE combat involving stylish combos, flashy super moves, and a whole lotta button pressing. The gameplay of the game is incredibly addictive, and I always end up coming back to see what absolutely crazy move I'll end up unlocking on the next class I play.  Speaking of classes, there is a GIGANTIC amount of variety in Dungeon Fighter Online. 14 classes, each with their own number of subclasses, totalling up to 52 different kinds of characters you can end up playing. Each subclass is unique, sharing barely any moves with their fellow subclasses, meaning even two people playing the exact same class can have entirely different experiences. All in all, it's incredibly worth it to play multiple characters, both because of variety...  ... and because you can only play a limited amount of time on each character a day. You're limited by Fatigue Points (FP), which goes down every time you enter a new room in a dungeon. Once you're out of FP, you can't play that character anymore. Because of this, I'm sure a lot of Pay-to-Win accusations are going to get thrown at DFO, but allow me to be clear; DFO is not Pay-to-Win. DFO is Pay-to-Convienence. You can certainly advance through the game quicker by spending real money, but it isn't going to give you any inherent advantage over somebody who goes completely free-to-play, especially when you consider that DFO gives out the paid content like candy in certain events.  All and all, DFO is an incredibly fun and addictive game that I would highly recommend to anybody looking for a major time killer. Don't let a bunch of people who played the game for two seconds flat and swore it off convince you not to give it a try; you just might like it.",

At any rate, the game is fun with a bunch of different game mechanics thrown at you which can be confusing at first.

I would recommened this if you want a pretty fun game, and you don't want to spend any money. Oh also the art style is very anime esc, I personally don't have a prefrence when it comes to art, I'm fine as long as it looks nice.

Fell in love with the game due to its low PC requirements, flashy visuals for a 2d game, and the generally gorgeous sprites which eventually gave way to the lovely term 'Fashion Fighter'.  Now many people have complained in one form or another about a mechanic called 'Fatigue Points' which ultimately limits how much you can play a day per character, this is not a problem despite what people say otherwise! You have a wide variety of classes to choose from each with their own subclass that (sometimes) perform different from the base class, so while you may want to play a single character ('Main') the game encourages, even rewards, you to try other classes/characters. Not mentioning there are ways to increase your playtime daily per character through items or events which are abundent.   The actual gameplay can be gorgeous. Generally fast paced combat with lovely visuals attached to many skills, though admitally a lot of the coolest looking skills do not appear to later. Luckily for many a player (Both new and existing) the leveling process was streamlined so can progress at a brisk pace and see what your class can do really fast. ",

We all know that no one cares if you are a god in PvE mmos, and it isn't satisfying too if you can solo whatever hard boss there is in game.  I'd reccomend this game if you want something casual with good old fashioned beat'em'up and Sega megadrive graphics. Having friends makes just everything faster and easier, but it won't make it that better. At least in my experience.  I will have more motivation on playing it when more servers will be implemented, as I like PvP, and for now I can't even dream about it thanks to 2-300 ping, because I'm in Europe and servers are in America. And even there people can have ping issues on PvPs as there is only one server for Noth America and one for South America.  So yeah, fighting game without competitiveness.

Using Mileage Points that you earn from just playing the game can get you a small selection of cosmetics as well.  When your Fatigue runs out, just play an alt. It takes a pretty long time to max out anyways and It's fun to try out other classes in this game in the meantime if your Fatigue ever does run out.  Ascension at level 50 is super easy if you just use the Auction House. I guess others that mentioned Ascension negatively in their Reviews just didn't take the time to figure this out.   I sold my items to a vendor up until I ran out of Clear Cubes which you need to use some of your Skills. So to get more Clear Cubes you can either use a dissembler in town to turn your White/Blue Gear items that you pick up while doing dungeons or buy more Clear Cubes from the AH. I dissembled my Whites &amp; Blues until it seemed like I had enough Clear Cubes then I went back to selling my Whites &amp; Blues for Gold because then you'll have more than enough Gold to buy whatever Quest Items you need from the AH so you don't have to farm it all yourself.   Some Classes are Super Easy to just breeze through everything while Leveling. That's what happened with me. My first character is a Knight --&gt; Chaos and is level 52 currently. My second character is a Female Nen Master and is level 26. The Nen Master takes way more effort so far. I have no idea how much better it will be later on. They're both fun imo.  The game does feel grindy but I just take a short break then I feel like hopping right back on afterwards.  I love the Music, The Art Style/Graphics &amp; the Beat em' Up gameplay.

Why haven't you downloaded it yet?  -IMPORTANT: You have to adjust your language settings in your computer and download Japanese/Korean (or East Asian Language Files, depends on your computer version i think) language packs to be able to type in chat. Otherwise, chat functions is deactivated and unusable.  -Gameplay wise it's very fun. It does not encourage to use the 'multiplayer' part of it too much. Been solo-ing the game no problem with all my characters and have yet to feel 'damn i need some help here'. It feels quite like those arcade games you used to play way back when. It has a very 'beat em' up' style to it.  It has a feel kinda like Tibia with the timed habilities, classes, and pvp, so if you enjoy/ed that game, this one is definetely for you.  -The sprites, characters, backgrounds and animations are very colorful and well designed and do not suffer from same-face disease.  -It has NO lag, considering i have very trash internet connection that is a very big plus for me. So if you have crap internet but wanna play online this is the game to do it.   -The characters all have a lot of abilties and transformations into new advanced versions of themselves with even more habilities. It's quite customizable. HOWEVER, if you want avatars to personalize your char, you have to pay for them with real money. Unless you get it in an event, there is no way to get avatars for in-game currency, which kinda sucks.   -For beginners to this type of game, it would be a little too much because it throws you out there without any guides or explanations in game. It expects you to internet search guides and learn by yourself instead of teaching you stuff.   -I personally find the screen a tad bit cluttered, but it adds to the nostalgia. A little more organization of pop-ups and the bar would be quite nice. It is, however, not difficult to naviagte.   -It looks very good at 1080p eventhough it does not run at that resolution. (i think it runs at 480p?), no blurriness whatsoever.  -All the classes are balanced and fun to play. It also lets you decide which style you want to play it without punishing you for choosing one over other. You can also change between classes without any penalties.   -It runs incredibly smooth and without problem, considering it's age. I think it will run good in most computers no matter what, so if you play with laptop/old pc, this will be big plus for you.  -Unlike most korean mmorpgs it has an actual storyline and quests with fleshed out story and characters! Granted, most quests are basically kill thing/clear dungeon/talk to person. But it is very appreciated that it shows that the quests have actual effort put into making them interesting.   -Great variety of monsters with very different styles of combat.  -For the strategy part...ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh nah. I have yet to use any real strategy, i am pretty sure it is necessary in higher levels though. But if you get this game because you expect to planificate your attacks from level 1, well, good luck on that.  -There is a big influx of scammers since it got into steam, so be mindful of that. You can block them easily.  -The menu is a cluttered mess, and so is the chat.  -Honestly just get this game, it's good and fun. It is also free unless you are a customization junkie, so what's stopping you.",

The resolution by default is completely stretched and blown out way off-screen, and the only way to change the resolution is to get in game.
