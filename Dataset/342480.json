Definitely recommend this game, and the game doesn't take long to install.  My rating 8.5/10",

            "review_text": "This game promises to be inspired by the FPS past, and you can see that it has some of those elements from them, as well as some newer element. Also, it is basically all custom maps that others made, however if you are to create a map, be sure to face negative criticism, as people tend to vote negative for a map where they simply died once or could not find their way out of a situation. Also, there seems to be few people who will join a match (especially one that has only one person in the game, which makes no sense because if they joined the game then there would be more people in the game), so be sure to have something planned to do as you wait). I suggest playing it, especially with friends to prevent the wait issue.",

            "review_text": "To rate this game I would give it anywhere from a 5/10 to a 7/10. It's good to mess around with for a while. My problem is the limited content. You have to buy more packs to get more blocks, guns, and stuff to shoot. I haven't messed around too much but I still recomend it. For one reason. It tells you that the co-op mode is supposed to have traps which to me means that I need to design a rage level.   EDIT: I might put some money into it to see if it's better when you buy stuff. But what I would prefer A game made by valve that is just TF2 but instead with level creation and full character creation. Just imagine playing TF2 but with a custom character it would be cool if you make it and then assaign your little person/thing a class.",

Some people might not like the old graphics but personally I like them. If you are into map making then this is a great game to start map making because it is very easy once you learn how to play and can help you with making maps in other games. I've had alot of fun making maps in this and it is very exciting publishing a map and having people playing your map and voting on whether they think it's good or think it's bad. I really like this game and you should definitely get this game considering that the game itself is free and it only takes a little bit of your time.",

The gameplay is quake/doom styled arena deathmatch with some coop servers, and with the ability to make your own maps entertainment is endless.",

            "review_text": "Gunscape is very similar looking to the first 2 Doom games, not to be confused with the modern 2016 release. I'm talking about the original 1990s versions that released on the Sega 32X, SNES and Windows 95. The game is very fun and you can easily get shooting in one of the campaign levels or 'GET PSYCHED' in one of the user created levels. That's right, you can build a malicious despicable death trap to let others explore and fight in. However this game expects you to die, A LOT! Thankfully you don't have to restart the whole level whenever you die. Whenever you die, you respawn at the last checkpoint you activated, and none of the enemies that you had killed (except the ones that are told to respawn after a set time) will respawn. Weather your buying the full game, going for the gold, or playing free, the game still aims to please. On a side note, If you're the builder type, buy the game. I say this because if you do not buy the game you only get access to some of the blocks available in the level builder. This game is definitely a great way to have some fun, even on low end systems like old laptops.",

A NAZI!!! this game is also minecraft-like with the ablility to build worlds. probably, you were wondering, whats it with the standered and gold? well, for more content, you have to get gold or standered. thats howe they get the money. if you just want to run aroun in a server and kill people or go co-op in campaign, this games for you. if you want to build, might want to get gold or standered  hope you enjoyed the review.",

How great that i don't have to learn all these weapons and controls by myself. Nevermind, lets just start reading the controlls.  Allright, I'm back. Now to shooting nazis. How great this game is hard so far. Nevermind, i died. Wait whaaaat? I just respawn? That's it? No game over? No lifes? No enemy respawn? Nothing? Not even ammo reset? Allright, back to shooting zombies i guess. Oh, so my GREAT advisor thought this is the safe door? Well guess what? HE WAS WRONG.   What a great plot. That was more obvious than i thought. After i finished the campaing let's play some community-made levels... Well, this one sucks. This one sucks too... And this one... From what i know this type of game is better with friends, so: let's find some players. Oh... Servers are empty... OK then, because all these maps are bad with no plot and/or challenge i will try and make one myself. Great, you have to pay for half of the blocks, weapons and enemies. Forget it, I'm not paying 19,99€ just to make a good map for 4 people i will never meet again. I QUIT. I QUIT. I FREAKIN QUIT.",
