            "review_text": "Entertaining and realistic naval warfare simulator where the player acts as a commander of a whole fleet, which includes various ships (transporters, aircraft carriers, battleships), submarines, planes (fighters, bombers, scouting) and helicopters, along with all their instruments. That includes many different radars, missiles and torpedoes. The scenarios allow for creativity and tactics, as in most missions you are given the fleet to command, but how you use it is up to you. Usually the success depends on all units and instruments working together, but as even single missions are somewhat randomized (the same mission plays differently when playing second time because enemy units spawn in different locations and in different quantities etc.) and require adjusting tactics or adapting new ones. Did you use bombers in this mission and replay it? Now you might get surprised the AI has much more powerful air force, but perhaps at the cost of submarines? Moreover the game has a huge amount of vehicles and weaponry from various countries, South and Northern American, European, Middle Eastern and Asian. Missions also happen on different places of the world with many different sides. One time you sink Brazilians as Argentinians, the other you sink Chinese as Taiwanese, and so on (though it seems everybody speaks English). You can also choose single missions of different difficulty, beginning with the easiest and slowly getting into more and more challenging ones as a great way to learn the game and form tactics. This is probably the best and the most fun naval combat game I've ever played. In addition, if you are new to the genre, you can set to automatic many settings, which will make a bit more similar to more popular RTS genre and get you accustomed to use of various radars, weapons and vehicles.  10/10 (Awaiting my doritos!)  PS. install nGlide to get rid of menu flickering on modern hardware.",
