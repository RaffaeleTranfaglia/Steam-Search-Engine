So here we go:  + skill-based + everything is customizable (controls, GUI/HUD, character, weapons, etc.) + nicely designed maps + many skills/spells + low price for nice product  - only multiplayer - outdated graphics (personally I think this doesn`t matter, been playing Mount and Blade for ages, one of my favorites) - a bit more fps would be nice - small community (this really is an issue)  BUT WE can actively increase the online community by sharing this nice game to others, I mean its 0,99, it runs on low PCs and it`s really fun, what more do you want? We should give this game the chance it deserves.",
