Really, they are. You just have to remember their place. Because if you want to beat the game, you have to know your path through every level.  Music isn't annoying, graphics are ok. So why am I still stuck in level 3? Because I've no real skill. That's what the hardcore gamers will tell me. But... it's not a question of skills. It's a question of remembering the enemies. To see the enemy's bullet through explosions. And mainly, I'm under the impression that when you have to go to the left, you're slower.  And the bosses? It's up to you to learn how to avoid their bullets. So, no, it's not a question of skill. It's a question of patience and remembering.  Still, the game is perhaps short. But a save system (or a credit one) would have spared many many players the frustration that basically, they're killed in level 5? Too bad, you have to go through all worlds again.  Only for hardcore gamers. Or stubborn people like me.",

            "review_text": "I like this game -- but *I RECOMMEND IT ONLY WITH RESERVATIONS*.  This is ABSOLUTELY hard as nails. No continues, no save points, no nothin. Hell, there's not even a bomb mechanic or anything like that. What there *IS*, however, is pretty solid straightforward shmup action, straight out of the early 80's on a play mechanic level.  There are a lot of reasons to dislike this game, but for genre enthusiasts (and/or purists...?) there are also lots of reasons to LIKE the game. Even though I'm pretty sure I'll never beat this (being too old, too ADD, and with too poor a memory) I've still gotten a good bit of enjoyment from it -- and the price is right.  So, if you're NOT a huge shmup fan, I don't recommend this one. If you ARE, tho, I wholeheartedly do.",

This time it's 'Tiamat X', which let's you destroy hordes of space ships, robots, asteroids and weird dog robots that shoot missiles.   The gameplay is as standard as can be, there's absolutely nothing that stands out in this game compared to all the other shooters. The game is difficult, the controlls are OK and there's an option to turn on 'auto shoot' but the enemies are harder if you use that option.  The graphics are not pretty to say the least and you often can't see incoming bullets. Some of the enemy designs aren't that bad.  The sounds in-game are just regular space shooting sounds but the worst is probably the music, which sounds like it has a bitrate of 128kpbs or less.   Overall, Tiamat X is probably one of the worst games in the genre. The only good thing about it is the price but even then it's probably not worth it.  ",
