            "review_text": "I admit, I miss tabletop gaming. I miss the DM trying to kill off my characters. I miss creating ridiculously out-of-the-box characters. Heck, I miss the days of popcorn, Mountain Dew, and just hanging out and rolling some dice. Those days have been gone for me quite some time ago, and yet playing a little game called Knights of Pen and Paper reminded me of those good old days.  Knights of Pen and Paper attempts to mimic tabletop gaming for an accessible audience. Players start by selecting three noobs to join the adventuring party, along with their class and starting skill. Like any tabletop RPG, as the adventuring party explores, kills baddies, and completes quests, they earn experience to level up and gain more skills. Each party member gets one skill point every time they level up and can only put points into one of four skills. While this creates simplicity for those unfamiliar with RPGs, it doesn't provide a lot of variety.  In fact, variety is what Knights of Pen and Paper struggles with throughout its twenty hour campaign. Although the backgrounds mimic an 8-bit style, there isn't much in terms of detail or design. The soundtrack loops, but it feels like there's only three tracks in the entire game. Although there's plenty of classes in the game, many of them are locked and the requirements for unlocking them appear random. The base classes — paladin, mage, cleric, etc. — while classic, are trapped with only four skills, which wouldn't be the case in tabletop gaming.  While variety isn't the game's strong suit, accessibility is. It provides a simple turn-based battle system wherein players can select between attack, skill, defend, item, and flee. This makes for an easy learning experience, but it lacks any real depth that a tabletop game has. The game is also surprisingly grindy, and while it does a great job of teaching players what to expect in encounters (usually enemies three to five levels higher than the adventuring party), it's a bit crazy how much players will have to stop and grind because it's not entirely on par with the party's level. It feels like the developers set out to make a simple RPG to give players the feel of tabletop gaming, but the combat could have benefitted from actual dice rolls on screen to indicate whether or not the player's characters succeeded or fail in their actions. However, with the grindy combat, perhaps adding dice rolls would have just made everything take longer than provide more accessibility. Still, the combat lacks depth and it needs something else to make it a more engaging process.  Dice rolling does exist within Knights of Pen and Paper, it's just not as frequent as it should be. Dice rolls occur when players travel between areas, failures leading to battles, successes leading to safety. Dice rolls occur when players are mining for grindstones or moving through dungeons. These elements are done well and are fairly straightforward, but this game would really benefit if it was implemented into all actions, especially if its goal is to mimic tabletop games. What's further disappointing is the campaign itself. While the writing is charming and hilarious, the majority of the quests are either escort missions, collecting items, slaying some bad dudes, or traveling from place to place for plot purposes. The amount of backtracking in this game is brutal and inexcusable, and even the adventuring party complains about it. It goes back to that problem of accessibility versus variety — on one hand, the campaign should be easy to learn and follow along, on the other hand there should be more to do than then the standard affair. The charm in the writing, and even its awkward translation errors, can only go so far and will likely leave veteran RPGamers wanting something more substantial.  However, Knights of Pen and Paper does succeed in its overall atmosphere. Players get the sense of gamers hanging out, bantering, and asking to pass the Mountain Dew. There is an overal sense that the Dungeon Master is out to kill the adventuring party, and the back and forth within the writing really does work well. The graphics and music, though overly simplistic, are vibrant and give the feeling that players are on an adventure and there is loot to be had. The game is also a fantastic time waster because in its lack of depth it success at being the type of mindless game where players find themselves going, 'just one more quest.' Considering all of the game's flaws, it admittedly succeeds in the one area that for some people matters most: it's actually fun.  There are some perks in Knights of Pen and Paper's PC release that differ from the original mobile version. For starters, it allows players to leave party members at the tavern, and bring a new adventurers into the party. They can roll for a new character and not feel like they have to start their entire campaign from scratch. There's also an extended campaign for those who want to explore more of what the game has to offer, and there's tons of new dungeons and loot to acquire. The main campaign can be completed in around twenty hours, with the extended campaign offering quite a bit of repaly value. There's also tons of items that can be purchased in shops that can give added bonuses to various stats, which is a nice cosmetic feature.  Knights of Pen and Paper is a sweet little throwback to the days of pen and paper gaming, but its simple approach may not be enough to entice every RPGamer. Yes, the combat is simplistic, but it's fast and easy to roll with. Sure, the story is simple, but it's cute in its presentation. Knights of Pen and Paper's imperfections are many, and yet it's completely easy to sink time into. It's straightforward in its approach and yet, despite its flaws and frustration, I kept playing. Knights of Pen and Paper will never offer gamers a deep experience, but it offers mindless gameplay that admittedly can keep you coming back for more.    Recommended ",

A turn based gameplay makes fits this much more than a normal action type. I love how you can swap in 'team members' to the table once you purchase more seats at the table.  Another thing which is probably overlooked in Knights of Pen &amp; Paper, is the dialog of the dungeon master and the players, some really humours lines came out during my playthrough and I would really recommend anyone read through them for a giggle.   The soundtracks can get fairly repetitve but what do you expect for an 8bit style game. I'm up to about twelve hours gameplay and I am still finding new things to try out.

This business model is unacceptable. If I pay money for a game I expect there to be a final transaction for me to enjoy the game as is. When I'm expected to buy my progress through the game on the other hand, under no circumstances do I want to pay money up front, especially not without being notified of these transactions. I don't want to pay a fair price for a game only to find out that I will have to invest a lot more to really enjoy it.

            "review_text": "Heh.  -_-  Okay, so: do you A.) Like Dungeons and Dragons-style adventuring games? B.) Like playing actual D&amp;D style games, on pen and paper? C.) Would like to try a simulator of the two?  This is that game.   Will you like it? That's debatable.  I bought this game when it was a daily deal because I like pen and paper D&amp;D-style games. Note that I had received all of the boosts from the digital deluxe version.  The retro-style graphics are a nice aesthetic, and there is quite a bit of variety with the creatures you will encounter in the game.  So the game plays with you as the DM (dungeon master) overseeing a game of D20 Knights of Pen and Paper. You have seats that can sit how ever many characters you would like to use, but the last few seats require you to pay the in-game currency. You can keep grinding to afford the seats in the future.  For each seat, you can sit a type of character (ex: hipster, grandma) and assign them a specific class (ex: barbarian, bard). This offers a seemingly wide range of party configurations.  The difficulty is completely self-driven, as you are both the DM and the players. That being said, you may have an 'objective' to kill 5 orcs - you can choose to fight them 1-at-a-time, or all at once, or whatever configuration you prefer. The entirety of the game involves A LOT of grinding, and this is even considering the boosts you may have gotten from the deluxe edition.   I love D20 games, but this game can become repetitive extremely quickly. If there was a multiplayer cooperative functionality, it might have saved it a bit, however, there isn't one.  There is A LOT of variety for you to upgrade - you can change everything from the type of table you're playing on (each type provides different bonuses) to the type of door in the room to the DM. All of this can help shape your overall party into a specfic area, like tanky high HP characters, or high MP, magic-relying casters.  I paid ~$5 US for the deluxe edition, and I think even then you may want to hold off and wait for it to be cheaper, if you are interested in trying the game.",

The game is REALLY resource intensive for what it is. (It uses 14% to 17% of my CPU just idling at the title screen.) Text is recycled far too often. The music isn't bad, but it is way too short. So in a given fight it probably loops 5 or 6 times. Alternate save files don't have independant gold, room items, characters, or classes; however, the blacksmith doesn't carry over. (The whole idea of all that being persistent is just stupid as it was physically impossible to get the game over achievement unless I deleted my save file.) More of a nitpick, but the developers made themselves the best characters in the game. (That's a bit too narassistic, in my opinion, and since they have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ one-liners it ruins most of the fun of the game.)   Overall: I got the game in a sale because it looked like it would fun to play. Little did I know I would just make a party full of physical attackers, leave the twister floor mat on, and just run this in the background while I played other games. The game got a bit of a chuckle from me when I first played it, but as the game dragged on it just got more monotonous due to there being no real growth in the game. Everything in the game scales linearly, including mana costs, so it's more about playing keep up with how much health the enemies in later areas have as opposed to actually feeling strong.",

You are playing a game about a bunch of gamers playing D&amp;D A few obvious jokes and references and things start out pretty well. The sound, music, graphics, they all lend themselves pretty well.  But the grind, jeez! This is a single player game! Who thought that... Converted mobile app with a cash shop in the mobile version? Ooooooooooooooooh  I don't need to say much more really. As far as converted mobile games go its actually really well ported. But the play time is so artifically padded that you probably will not complete the game.  A sequel has been announced and I hope and pray it addresses the flaws this game has or even just does away with the excessive grinding for the inevitable PC port.  I know some smartass will reply that this is an RPG and you are supposed to grind but this isn't 1997 anymore. Games like Bravely Default, like Magic Fantasy Battle 4, have come along and said 'listen, there is grinding but we streamlined it or we made it  fun .'  I stopped caring about the storyline the 8th time I was told to backtrack for excuse reasons. I especially stopped caring when my Lv32 Barbarian, with maxed equipment, wearing 4 +9attack items, still can't one shot a friggen spider!  I especially was agitated that a newer version of this game was released that I can't simply upgrade too, or even buy apprently since steam says 'you already own that game' when clearly I don't.   Flaws aside the game is enjoyable in short bursts which is fitting given its mobile phone roots. It was ported to the PC and no real effort was made to make it a more PC friendly game. Instead its dull, repetitive and boring. Also the achievement, beat in 365 (game)days, is unachievable it seems. That's always nice for the achievement hunters.",

You can have several parties going at once and share earned gold across parties which can make for interesting progression styles. There are permenant upgrades to your table and the room you're playing from that really change the way the game is played and I felt that was a very nice touch.  The DEV team was bought out so there's no real support for the game anymore, it has some odd bugs in it still and can occasionally break if you do some things too quickly.  Overall 100%ing this game was fun and a steady challenge it took me just under 30 hours.  I have a difficult time recommending this game though since it's not really something that just anyone can pick up and play. This game can be frustratingly difficult at times. Especially if your party composition is unable to overcome an obstacle, you may have to start a new game to support your main party.

            "review_text": "I love this game. Everything about it has an old-school feel that blends tabletop RPGs with NES graphics. There is a lot of grinding in this game, but that's what RPGs are about. You choose your initial characters from an assortment of people who each have their own unique bonuses, then pick a class for them based on those bonuses and what you want in your party.   If you make challenging enough fights, they require a bit of strategy. My paladin typically casts a shield to reduce damage by 50%, then increases his threat to draw attention, while my rogue stuns people for 3 turns (thanks to items I have that extend the time by 2 turns). My mage will either AoE the entire group or fireball for a burning DoT. My cleric has a powerful single heal, decent group heal, an offensive move called smite, and a debuff on 3 enemy's attack strength. My newest addition, the berserker, goes berserk (I can't choose his targets but he gains extra damage and regen) and has passives/equipment that boost his crit rate above 30% while also allowing him to heal for 63% of his total damage. And those are just my 5 classes, there's quite a few more to unlock as you play.  The grinding part comes in two forms. You'll find yourself moving back and forth to caves often to get grindstones to upgrade your blacksmith. You'll also want to fight a lot, and grind quests to earn gold. Gold can be spent buying yourself some equipment at the blacksmith, or on a whole bunch of upgrades to the room you play in, the table you play on, etc. Purchases made will give your party bonuses, such as higher RNG die rolls, more gold/exp, boosted stats, regen, etc.  There's always something to do in this game. It can be tedious at times, but the humor of the game, including comments from the game master and party members help to ease this. Overall, I think it would be a worthy addition to anyone's library who is a fan of old school RPGs.",

            "review_text": "Hard to recommend, but recommending nonetheless. Why? It's just full of charm, funny little cultural references and has a pretty good amount of content. However combat gets very boring as each class has 4 abilities, one of which is just a passive for 80-90% of the classes. So you largely spam the same 1-2 abilities, with the rare use (sometimes once a fight later on) of a 3rd ability, and sometimes a basic attack.  Other gripe is upgrading items at the blacksmith. Farming grindstones takes forever after the 1st or 2nd upgrade for him. However if you want upgrades without spending ALL of your gold, you need to gather dozens of these at a time for a 5-10% increase in chance of succesfully forging an item. Don't even bother trying unless you're at about 60% success, because you can waste almost all your gold upgrading one or two items. It's a shame because this could have been a really fun and important mechanic, but feels really forced. The only way to get grindstones is travel to caves, and hopefully roll a high enough number for each ore vein present, or spend 25 G a piece. As I said though this can take ALOT of grindstones and buying that amount can really add up in early-midgame as gold generally isnt earned fast. Battles (depending on bonuses of items you have and what you are fighting) generally drop 1-20 gold.  The blacksmith, repetive fighting and slow accumlation of gold are painfully dull or even annoying. However, the concept, dialogue, references, simplicity and music keep it entertaining enough to play for 20 or so minutes at a time.",

You have to pay gold to walk between locations, so it feels like you're questing on a Monopoly board; 'Go south 2, kill 7, come back' or 'Escort 5 spaces East, get attacked every step, come back' while you are paying each way. Dumb.  The little dungeon system... is annoying. You can't rest or run away from a fight or it boots you out and you have to do the whole dungeon again.

It's great fun, and the game-within-a-game structure makes for some funny moments in the main quest. While the gameplay can get a little stale after you've maxed everyone out (not hard to do), it's still a fun diversion from time to time. I can wholeheartedly recommend KoP&amp;P, but at the same time ... it's game that's also a tremendous missed opportunity for something greater.  My big complaint about the game is the lack of additional content. The one DLC, 'Haunted Fall,' is a mere sliver of addtional content, and hardly worth the price. This is the kind of game that SCREAMS for a rich set of adds ons and expansions, particularly for high-level gameplay. After two years, however, we have one lackluster, overpriced expansion that would have been a free upgrade from most other publishers.  If it had Steam Workshop support, it could easily become one of the best pick-up-and-play RPG games out there. But, again, we have nothing like that. Just a great core game and some tantatlizingly untapped potential.  That said, at $10 it's a touch on the pricey side. I picked my copy up on sale for perhaps $5, and when the DLC was maybe $3. It's a great deal at $8, but I'm not sure I'd feel the same way at $20 for the Deluxier version. If you can get it on steep sale, you won't regret it.

The story wasn't nearly as good as I thought it was going to be, but the gameplay wasn't as bad as I thought, so that kept me going. The difficulty of the game kept going upwards, which is understandable. I did enjoy it. For a while. Then I hit a pay wall. Yes, this game has in-app-purchases for gold, which the whole game revolves around; with enough gold you could pretty much beat the whole game while using a first level character. The whole game is constructed around selling this gold, at least seemingly; although the grind times were long at some points, I didn't mind since games like these always have long grind times. However when I spent a very long time grinding for a single fight, I realized that the game is geared toward trying to get you to buy gold.  Good game. Bad business model. Not worth 10 dollar. I'd say buy it for one or two if the concept interests you, and as always, veer as far away from making in-app-purchases in a game you already paid for as possible.",

You have a dungeon master that sits at a table along with your party. He tells a story and provides quests for you to do. It's a pretty easy game and fun too. You can determine how the game is played. You want to just solo it, bring 5 different classes along, fight just 1 monster or 7.. it's your call.  All in all if you dig the graphics and of course like rpg's this game is a definite play through.",

            "review_text": "Knights of Pen and Paper is charming. That's how people tend to describe it. I'd consider it a scripted digital version of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. It even has some of the old tongue-in-cheek humor present in the old sessions my friends and I used to play late into the night. Overall, it's a very fun, very tedious, very strategic, and, above all, simply charming.  I can't say I cared much for the grind. There is a fair bit of that in this game, with the quests all following the same basic structure. Go here, kill this, escort this person. What keeps this game alive is the sly humor and nods to other cultural institutions (Steam Island and Nabe Gewell among them). Truthfully, its replay value is pretty low. When I realized I had to play two campaigns for the achievements, I was thoroughly disappointed. The first time though, I laughed, I cried, I couldn't put it down. When it came time to play it agian, I literally couldn't be bothered to.  On balance, this game receieves a positive recommendation for me. Even though it's a bit tedious to get all the achievements (so. much. gold. grinding.), I think that it's a fun casual game for non-completionists. If you're after all the achievements, it won't be too hard. You'll get them. A thousand hours and an endless grind later.",

I am halfway in the game and my only concern really is wether I want to play the campaign again, giving the limited amount of classes and class combinations.",
