            "review_text": "What are the similarities between Ground Control 2 and its spiritual successor World In Conflict? Both ended in a cliffhanger, yet neither are getting any new sequels made to pick up where their endings left off.  Which is sad, because both games have yet to feel outdated (graphically showing its age but still held up well) and are as addictive as ever even after all these years. Ground Control 2 in particular is sold at an unjustified low price that its easily snatchable even during non-discount period. If you can't afford the latest RTS or looking for random curiosities in the bargain bin, consider picking up Ground Control 2.",

            "review_text": "I see no reason why this game is a part of Ground Control series. Ground Control I and II are absolutely different games, and personally I'm very disappointed with GC II. Here are the reasons why.  In Ground Control I, I liked to manage my squad: select correct equipment and correct units (each have their own strengths and weaknesses), and then go with my party of battle-hardened veterans from one mission to another. They gain experience and start to fight better. I liked naming my squads, I liked statistics, medals, ranks and other cool stuff, which kinda left some 'wargame' feeling, and make some bounds between you and your soldiers, the feature which was absolutely great. In GC II, this part of a game was totally cut off.  Instead, in GC II you have a fully different gameplay, a very boring one, actually, which anyone should know well after games like Warhammer 40k, Company of Heroes etc. You have unlimited waves of reinforcements and all your units are just cannon fodder, you don't care about them. Instead you select them and throw to the enemy's face till death or till all control points are captured. That's all. Yes, GC II has way better graphics than GC I, but that's the only advantage. Gameplay in GC II is boring and stupid. I don't recommend this game at all.  If you liked Ground Control I, then you should definitely play Codename: Panzers I and II. I guarantee that you'll be happy.",
