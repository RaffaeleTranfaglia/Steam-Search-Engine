            "review_text": "I told my friends I was idling for cards.   I lied.  Edit; Crap. You put me on the front page, here is a real review.  Let me start this honestly. I am totally biased. If My Heart Had Wings is the first Visual Novel I ever played, and I love it with all of my little heart. Also in case you didn't notice I've played this game for more than 900 hours, and only 20 of those hours were idle. I've run through each route in this game at least 15 times, and I can actually speak really crappy Japanese because of this game. In addition, I've spent more money on this game for the badges, emoticons, cards, extra cards and backgrounds. So yeah, I am biased.   If you chose to continue thanks, and here's the review;  The good parts of this game are extremely good, and the bad parts of this game are extremely bad. So here is the good.   1. The characters are well fleshed out, being both fully voice acted and having logical lives and choices. Sure each of them are anime tropes, but the tropes are presented so well that they work here. Ageha is the generic tomboy, Kotori is trapped in a wheel chair, Amane is the innocent genius, the twin's are polar opposites of eachother that rarely agree. Ageha's suggestive dialogue makes you smile, and Kotori's fears are understandable. Even Amane's childlike innocence is presented in conjunction with her hopes for the future, and living up to what it means to be an adult.   2. Next is the art, it's not the crazy excess.....of certain areas.....of the Sakura series, or the strange realism of more 'American' anime. Here the character's are mostly normal. This is a personal preference, but I certainly appreciate it.   3. The routes are also well done. Kotori's, of course, is the main route and does have the most story, and in the words of most reviewers 'it got da feels'. But, personally, Kotori is not my favorite route. I enjoy Ageha's more, as a matter of fact Ageha's route was the first I completed. Her personality develops as much as Kotori's on the route and becomes as complex as Kotori's. The same happens with Amane's route. The twins' routes are probably the least interesting, but still work well.  There is more good like the soundtrack, the dialogue, and the story itself but it's time to move onto the bad stuff.  1. Moenovel, and censoring. These are probably the most obvious problems. The game was originally published in Japan, and was translated by Moenovel. They did a pretty crappy job of it. Not only are their many horrible typos, and brutal censorship, they also directly detract from the story. One moment in particular always breaks the immersion. At one point Ageha is explaing that a women can control any man with her big, bouncy, round....eyes. Now, we all know that 'eyes' is definetely not the right word. This comment which could have gotten a laugh without censorship really crushes me. I have played this game with the fan-created restoration patch, but it is agony to install.   Overall, I think this game gains a solid 8/10 for most people and a 9.5/10 for me, mostly due to nostalgia. Definetely worth the purchase at full price, and a steal for less than $5.  Thanks for reading, this is my first legitimate review so please feel free tell me if there is something I should mention, or something I could improve on.  Another edit; Just hit 500 hours. Currently very proud of myself  One more edit; Thanks for voting this review to the top of the store page, I appreciate it alot.  Even more edits; 200 voters?! Thanks so much everyone!  I need to stop editing this; Thanks to steam user;   The Enlightenment   for pointing out that there is a partially complete (and free!) app for android and iOS of If My Heart Had Wings. Moenovel is updating it slowly, and the app is about 25% of the story.  This must take forever to read; 300 people! Wow. Thanks again guys.  Just keep adding, just keep adding; Thanks for getting this to 400 people!  More edits; Thanks for getting this to 500 people and still having a 99% rating, it's very appreciated.  I think the edits are longer than the review now; 600 people! Woohoo! Thanks everyone!  The amount of edits is getting ridiculous; 700!? Thanks again everyone!  A new edit; I didn't even now that there were 800 people in the whole world.  Más edit; 900 people, still 99% Thanks so much!  Edit #1000; 1,000 people! Now that's a milestone! We lost a precent somewhere along the way, but thanks anyways!  Nominated for Best Thing Ever Award 2016",

            "review_text": "Edit: It seems I get quite a bit of friend requests because of this review. If you plan to add me, please make your profile public as I like to see who I am dealing with.  Okay, spoiler alert: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!! Oh God, where to start? This has made me so FREAKING MAD. Now disregard the 0 hours I have on this, I have about 24 hours in the patched uncensored Japanese version. It uses the same translation as the steam version and the adult scenes are fan translated.  Now the 'company' called Moenovel has made a 'translation' of this game, or it should be. The translation is outright terrible! I don't know what incompetent idiots they hired, but they sure as hell aren't translators. About a good 20 hours into the game, it simply gets really really bad, they're mixing up names.  A few examples are: 1) At some point they're having dinner and they translate 'Hai-yo', which means '(yo) sure', but translated it as 'Mornin'' instead.  2) 'Amane plus knife equals dangerous... You take care of her, Aoi!' And instead of Aoi, she mentioned Kana.  3) Masatsugu: 'Ou- Ouch! Ah! Ageha!' which should be 'Oh, over there! Heeeeey! Agehaaaa!'  4) (This is seriously the next line) Ma-bou is Masatsugu's nickname 'Huh? Geez, you're such a baby! And so is Kumoi.' which again should be 'Oh hey, if it isn't Ma-bou! And Akari is here too.' (Akari is the first name of Kumoi.)  5) And this isn't the last time they misinterpret 'ita ita' as 'Ouch!', such is the case here: 'Ummm... Ah! Ouch!' which again should be 'Ummm... Ah! Over there!'  6) They also can't tell remarks apart from questions, such as translating 'uaa, honto da!' as 'Wow, really?' instead of 'Wow, it really is!'.  7) Again mixing up names: 'Habane-san wa?' as 'And Aoi?' instead 'Habane is?' or 'Kotori is?', since they always mention her by her first name for some reason.  8) Again a simply idiotic mistranslation here 'Are te...?' as 'Arrrrgh' instead of 'Isn't that...?'.  9) Did I also mention these people can't speak English? 'Did you forget about that those legs of yours?'  10) 'Do you have a twin?' instead of 'Where are the twinsisters?' After that our protagonist talks about ramen, but since he doesn't have a voice and I don't have the Japanese text here I am not sure what it said, but he completely fails to mention anything about the twins here in English.  So I mentioned 10 points in a game timespan of about 30 minutes! BUT THAT'S NOT FREAKING ALL! There is much more! I guess they somewhat made the beginning a bit less bad, since that only consists of mistranslations and typos. After the 22 hour mark they just plainly give up and put whatever crap they can come up with there. I suppose they didn't expect anybody to read this for more than 20 hours anyway.  Is this what the visual novel scene has come to? Translations made by incompetent idiots that do a worse job than google translate? Apparently yes, if you scroll up you can see that this game has a 'very positive' rating, VERY FREAKING POSITIVE! Either the players of this are very forgiving and hope the next VN translation is going to be better or steam just hates quality.  Now enough about the translation, for the game itself it PAINS me to not being able to recommend this. It's such a lovely novel, the characters are very cute and likeable, has a good story that keeps you interested and the art is great! I really love this novel, but that's exactly why I can't let this pass. The company has to pay for this pathetic excuse for a translation. So if you want to support the VN, buy the Japanese version instead, but not this one.  And as you might have seen, this one has been majorly censored, anything 'adult' is censored out. They even censored the kissing scenes! CENSORED! KISSING! That's ridiculous! There is a patch to uncensor the steam version, but it's very buggy. Which is the reason I decided to download the Japanese version instead.  So yeah, if you want to support a localization company, support Sekai Project or Manga Gamer instead.",

The plot revolves around a male protagonist in a high-school setting, having just returned to his hometown (for reasons that shall be kept spoiler-free) and studying while working a part time job in a girls' dormitory. This rather cliché opening quickly evolves to allow for a major super-plot while introducing several subplots (and subsubplots) within the various branching high-school romance options.   Gameplay",

Genre   4       Story   4       Animation/Picture   4       Characters   5       Music   5      The story follows a predictable plot arc of trials and success, and it fails to deliver any real emotional impact at any stage. That said, If My Heart Had Wings never tries to be truly tragic like many other games in the genre. Instead, it chooses to focus on positive experiences and friendships. The plot progresses slowly, but it's a relaxing ride.    Story  In 'If my Heart had wings' there aren´t many route to play(I really wish to have an Kotaru Ending, or the Fan Disc to be full translated, w/e) but every route has a nice story, I really enjoyed the Kotori route the most for example.   Animation/Picture  They are pretty cute and well drawned but why did I gave it 4 Stars than 5? Well, the 3D models were really...awkward, but nice 2D artworks.   Characters  Every character were made with love, all of them have a voice actors, even some people on the road.   Music  Great heartwarming music, I really enjoyed them they were great in the cutscene or in the movie.   Pros  -Beautiful 2D artwork -Heartfelt story -A badass duck -Voice for every characters -Nice Movies(there were 3 of them)   Cons  -Awkward 3D models -Limited choices/less route imo -Some translated sentence are non-sense  It took me quite some time to play through If My Heart Has Wings. This was partially due to its length, but also because I fell into its relaxed pace. There are a number of different endings to see, though actual choices made during the game are sparse. It's not a game that will satisfy expectations of intense drama, but it has an encouraging beauty to it that reminds us some dreams are worth pursuing. Its presentation is outstanding in both music and graphics, and it's surprisingly enjoyable to just sit and watch the images. If My Heart Had Wings is a game/VN worth playing.",

            "review_text": " If My Heart Had Wings  &lt;IMHHW&gt; is an English translation of a Japanese  VN = Visual Novel  that follows the struggles of Aoi, a young male recovering from a serious biking accident, in his relationships with several female classmates while he simultaneously manages an all-girl dorm. It even may tug a bit on your heart-strings as you follow the developing relationships as Aoi and the girls struggle to rebuild a glider.  IMHHW  is an excellent VN for a reader new to the genre. The story is well conceived and the programming to achieve the multiple story-lines is well done.   The Protagonist is a male Academy student  {Aoi =&gt; Ah-oh-ee; no inflection}  who just transferred from an all-boy school back to his home town following a serious Racing Cycle road accident. Fortunately  {?}  his mother arranged a job for him to keep him busy and help take his mind off his injury woes. The down side  {again; ?}  is that his job involves being 'House Mother' for an all-female, off campus, Academy dorm. Remember now, his mother set this up! And so the story goes ...  The Title theme revolves around a girl  {Kotori = “Little Bird”}  who has lost use of her legs and therefore is confined to a wheelchair. Because of this, she has become reclusive. Aoi meets her on Windmill Hill, where they see a high soaring glider that ignites their dreams. Kotori becomes enchanted with the possibility that she could be freed from her wheelchair and reach the clouds through involvement with the project to build a glider. Can Aoi possibly help her as he manages the dorm?   The story lines are entertaining. IMHHW has multiple {6} alternate story lines that depend upon the Reader's choices selected at various points in the story. Each of the alternative Endings provides a unique variation on the main story line that leads to   BAD End   should one make the wrong choices. Naturally, I found  Bad End  on the very first run-through by trying to pay attention to all the girls. It can be difficult {at least for me} to figure out just how to reach each Ending. That's the challenge! The purported game length is 30 hours {I suppose for someone who knows what she/he is doing}.   The  soundtrack  is great, easy listening. It captures the sense of soaring the glider provides for the characters. The theme songs are accompanied by English lyric captions for those who are Japanese-challenged. An included feature is a BGM collection of Soundtracks. There also is a gallery of CG art. Many of the pictures may be clicked to enable viewing of a series of views of those scenes.  A detraction is that the translation job is really very sloppy ... even careless! Still, it IS understandable and proceeds smoothly if one ignores those minor mistakes. It reads as though no one who knew English bothered to read the finished story. For instance, wrong-gendered pronouns pop up frequently. As an example, one of the main female characters had lost a dear friend. For a long time, I assumed  'he'  was a lost boyfriend.   WRONG  !! 'He'  turned out to be a  'she'.  Voicing still is in Japanese but I found that to be no problem. That may even help the reader improve his/her ability in speaking Japanese.   There is a  “Restoration Patch”  available on-line that restores the scenes censored for the Steam version. This  Restoration Patch  improves the translation and smoothes the scene transitions which made little sense in the Steam version.   Overall, I found this to be an enjoyable reading experience and strongly recommend it to any Gamer who may be interested in Visual Novels, or in finding out what VN's are like, or just in reading a really good story.",

(I do have to recomend that you take the time to install the restoration patch and get working if you play this game though. Applying the restoration patch does disable the steam achievements though) After finishing all route with the path I move my files to another folder and reinstalled the game to skip through to get the achievements. I then deleted the game files and moved the patched files back. Have the patched version with all my save data and got all the achievements :)",

The story is about Aoi Minase who comes back to his hometown which he haven't been to since 5 years. The first thing he does is to visit the new windmills that has been built when he was gone. He encounters a mysterious girl who's in a weelchair and they chat for some time. The real reason why Aoi is back is a job that he accepted from his mom, he's to work as a dorm mother for students. What he didn't know is that it's a dorm for girls, of course there's bound to be troubles. Much to Aoi's surprise the girl he met earlier on the windmill hill lives in that dorm (what a coincidence) but her personality has greatly changed from his view. Next morning on his way to the new school a cute girl calls out his name. She is Aoi's childhood friend Ageha and is in the same class as Aoi. They walk the road to school together whilst having a long-time-no see talk. I'm not gonna spoil anymore then that, please forgive me, I wrote more then I intended. Guess I got carried away thinking about this and it became more of a Summary then a review, oh well can't be helped. I finished the game with the Ageha route in about 14 hours (depends if you're a fast reader) but there are many other routes to take depending on your choices.

Perfect for lovers of top hat-wearing ducks. The story is fairly interesting and rather gripping; I first downloaded this game on my tablet, and then couldn't stop playing (if 'playing' is the correct term...) for a long time. One problem, however, is the 'Skip' function: it is more of a 'fast-forward,' and when I first played it after downloading the game on my PC, I had to wait for about 30-40 minutes to skip to the point where I left off. If there is a way that allows you to pick a major point in the story and skip to it that I missed, then you have my apologies for being inobservant. In addition, there are a few moments where the subtitles/narrative is completely wrong. Otherwise, I would say that this was the only major problem that I noticed.   One thing that I hated was   that it is impossible to date only Yoru, and that you can only pick either Asa or Asa and Yoru.    Overall, a very good game. Although, £10? I'm still not sure if it was worth quite that much. Maybe £7.50 - £8, but not £10.    Rating  Routes: 9 / 10 Background: 6 / 10 Characters: 8 / 10 Realism: 9 / 10  Overall: 8 / 10",

            "review_text": "Mmm... okay, I better get this review over with.  This is a dating sim, essentially. Though chances are you already figured it out. I ended up grabbing this on a whim at one point and eventually got around to playing it. As far as these sorts of games go, much is as you expect: high school, male lead with no voice acting, and a bunch of female leads that are some personality archetype with some added twists (like the Tsundere being bound to a wheelchair). What is new is the sheer volume of info this game throws at you about aerodynamics, and while that was interesting... its more info than the game needed.  Actually, having 'too much' is something I can throw at this game in a general way. It takes ~15 hours or so to go through one of the routes, but it feels longer than that as it is slow paced and has huge gaps where little of interest happens. This is not helped by the game having so few choices (and very simple ones at that) it almost feels like a Kinetic Novel (please be one or the other). In truth, I didn't even read all the text in this game because after the first playthrough (Kotori) I started skipping large amounts of dialogue that I hadn't seen yet because I knew nothing interesting was going to end up happening in a particular scene. Or rather, since basically every route of this game ultimately ends up in the same place, the 'new' scene was basically the exact scene again with perhaps some slightly altered text. A VN that does this... has a pretty serious problem.  Another thing this VN has too much of is drama. Now... drama is good, and some of my favorite VN's live off of it (Steins;Gate, Clannad, Little Busters!). But unlike those games, the drama here feels... fake somehow. The biggest story problems come from scenes that involve this teacher who has a MASSIVE petty grudge against your club and its long-standing member, Amane. He has 'reasons', but he comes across as the most petty of fools desperately trying to cling to what little authority they might have in a feeble attempt to try to seem relevant. It does not help that, aside from Amane's storyline, you never find out what his weak excuses for being a massive jackass are. Unfortunately, since one of the most recent 'new' anime/VN's i've watched/played was Higurashi... I spent much of my time while playing this game thinking of all the fun ways I wish this teacher would die horribly. And it never happened. Where is Sonozaki Shion when you need her? :(  Up to this point, you probably think I'm going to give this game a negative review. And trust me... this game is a hair away from me having done so. However, for much of what this game gets wrong, it gets too many other things right for me to do that and feel confident in doing so. Either that or I'm just sick of getting my negative reviews panned simply for being negative.  So what does this game do right? Well, the characters can be quite interesting and some of them are better than average. Kotori, while far from my favorite character, has a rather serious and memorable storyline about overcoming her personal tragedy (being unable to walk due to an accident) and what that does to a young girl psychologically who had lived a normal life up until that point. The other routes are a mixed bag: Ageha's was hard to enjoy, Amane's was filled with drama but ultimately heartwarming, Asa's was nice and huggly, and Yoru's was... weird. It was Yoru who ended up being my favorite character simply by being a snarky genius (she kinda reminded me of Makise Kurisu from Steins;Gate) that was a massive breath of fresh air in the second half of the game. In a game filled with airheads or the often-depressed, Yoru was entertaining and made me laugh quite alot. Sad that she and her twin Asa are lolis and that her route was... what it was.  The side characters tend to be pretty good too, except for that teacher and the idiot male tsundere Masatsugu. Kanako was fun too, though having her being the fan service girl by walking around half-dressed for much of her screentime was lame. Another character worth mentioning is Tatsuya, or A-chan, who sadly doesn't get much screen time but would have been great if he did. He kinda reminded me of being an older grown-up version of Natsume Kyousuke from Little Busters!, though Kyousuke is still better. Also the art was pretty good. Mostly.  Ultimately, if it wasn't for Yoru, story moments that were genuinely heartwarming, and the pretty art, I would have given this game a bad review. Maybe i've just played too many VN's lately and seen too many similar but better things that I am being much more mean to this game than I otherwise would have. My two recent VN's were Higurashi (woohoo paranoid terror) and Eden (;_;), both of which were quite good (Higurashi especially). This game just does not compare well compared to those, but I can't call it bad without feeling a little dishonest. But just barely.  One last thing: the translation is ♥♥♥♥. Also this game has very heavy (and uneven) censorship, but I don't want to get into that issue because its been brought up plenty by other people elsewhere. You basically either have to play this as a bad localization or as an eroge. And while I no longer believe that all eroges are porn-fests that lack story (see the works of Key/VisualArts), I still don't like it. The lack of middle ground here depresses me. :(  Anyway, I guess this game is ok. I very reluctantly give this game a 'yes' because there is no 'maybe' options and i've given worse games than this 'yes' in the past. Also because people who comment and vote on Steam reviews suck. Yes, I'm talking about you. o_O  Bwee...  Edit: Time has given me a more generous perspective on this game. Is it great? No. But it's not quite as bad as I had made it out to be. Still, much of what I wrote in this review stands, and the sheer volume of wordiness in parts of this game where interesting stuff just isn't happening guarantees i'll never play this game in its entirely again.",

I've been isolated like a few of the charcters in this game, and reading through it gives me hope for a bright future. This visual novel (because to be honest, it can't really be classified as a game by any definition) is so touching and is worth your time. Your first playthought will be between 25-30 hours, and after that you'll be able to skip most of it to finish all of the other routes, or reread it and enjoy it all over again. There are parts where you laugh, cry, and just start dancing (there is some pretty good music to go along with this novel) I'd personally recommend installing the restoration patch before playing, as the censorship in it is pretty bad (Check the forems for a how to). Fair warning, the sex scenes are pretty descriptive and may make a few people uncomfortable. Overall, between all the different routes, getting to know each character, and seeing each one's ending, i've been inspired to look for the best in people, something i haven't done in as long as i can remember, and find someone who i can share a dream with!",

            "review_text": "Alright, so to begin, I decided to give this one a try because of the aviation theme, and myself being a pilot. I haven't really 'read' too many visual novels, so I'm not exactly an authority on what a visual novel should be, but I liked this one. First and foremost, it is mostly a drama with comedy mixed in, but the overall theme could be summed up as 'letting go of a painful past to experience something better.' All of the characters that show up in the first chapter have something from their past that they need to overcome to move forward, and character developement is driven by the plot of them working together to try something most of them had previously not thought of doing: building and flying their own glider. Apparently there are six total endings, five of which appear to be romantic stories involving one of the disproportionate number of girls in the soaring club. I realize based on the core story cutscenes that the main story is a romance with Kotori, a girl who has been confined to a wheelchair after an accident, but I felt the most natural story was with Ageha, the childhood friend who recognizes the main character right off the bat after he returned to his home town. So, that's the only one I've completed so far. I saw in another review that before being translated by MoeNovel and put on Steam, this VN was originally in the 'eroge' genre. If you don't know what that means, I'll save you some time, it basically means pornographic. I'm glad they edited that out for the steam release, I think it would have detracted a lot from the more innocent story that I read. Not to say there isn't anything suggestive, and you can call me a prude all you want, but I think that if there was more explicit material it would not have fit my pallete as well. Also, I liked the OST, if you've heard music inspired by flight as much as I have, a lot of the instrumental themes will bring up feelings of nostalgia. I feel that I've heard it before, but I honestly haven't, if that makes any sense. Now, for some complaints... Ok, just one, I think I only made three or four choices in a story that lasted nearly twenty hours. I would have greatly appreciated it if I'd had more say in what the main character does, and there were many times that the character wrestles with a decision, but the audience isn't asked. Ok, I get it, too many decisions in something this long, and you're writing and animating and paying voice actors for a lot of different scenes. I understand that, but there were just too many decisions made that I felt would have been more fun to put into the audiences hands, instead of just asking which girl the audience wants the character to spend an event with a few times, and then deciding which overall story to tell. Overall, though, as nerdy as this story telling medium seems to be considered, I like it. It reminds me of the Goosbumps: Choose Your Own Story books I read as a kid, but these tend to be directed at a more mature audience, and there's so much more stimulation from the visuals, the music, and the voice acting, which mostly for my English-only speaking self mostly just clarifies the tone in which something was said. Anyways, if I had to give this a rating on a scale of 1-10, I'd put it in the 8.5/10 ballpark. My complaint, despite in my mind actually being a semi-serious issue for me, is well outweighed by everything that went right, from theme, to characters, to art, the soundtrack, to the story told. Well, safe flying ya'll.",

Attending school he meets with some of his friends from his past as he trys his best to fit in around the area. Along the way he stumbles among a old storage room which held parts for a glider, the same glider he saw as he arrived into the town, and a young girl in a wheelchair which he also met with at the same time as the glider flew above them both. Through the days Aoi decides to try help with the building of the glider with the owner, a girl with a history of repeating school and claims that shes a idiot when she knows so much, along with one of his past friends and soon the girl in the wheelchair, what follows will be a tale filled with happiness, sadness and possibly even love.  As i am writing this i have finished one story path in this visual novel, this VN has multiple endings for you to decide on so when you finish one route you could always find out what the other alternatives could of been. There are a few typos here and there where the words may not make sence or fit in but if you can get over that then this is a must-read in my opinion.

If my heart had wings is a VN based on our protagonist Aoi, who after a brutal biking accident can no longer compete in biking competitions. After several years he returns to his hometown only to discover a airplane flooating in the wind, which eventually leads him to the central female protagonist of the game (No spoilers for her), a handicapped young teenager named Kotori. This game beautifally blends Romance and Sci Fi together, as this story takes place in a somewhat futuristic setting.  PROS  +Beautifally written story, yes I understand the translation isn't exactly A+ material, but hey its good enough that you can understand the gist of it unless your illeterate, use your imagination and reword the sentence so its not so direct and plain.  +Beautifal voice acting, the voices are amazing and are capable of conveying the emotions to you (especially Amane later on)  +Intresting facts: I don't know about you guys but I thouroughly enjoyed learning about gliders and aeroplanes, the dynamics and design. The game teaches all about it through the common route and and the heroines route.  +Twin Lolis. Need I say more.  +Beautifally designed CG's   +Beautifal charecter designs  +Gorgeous childhood friend  +The soundtrack in this game is unforgettable, i don't regret buying the soundtrack DLC  +Its a long VN, i'm barely done with it as i've only finished Amane and Kotori  +The Skip Button  CONS  - While the story is good the translation needs to be worked on...... alot..., fuwanovel has translated it so plain and direct that the feelings the sentence is trying to impart is like saying 'I put my lips on her, i sucked on them, they felt good.' =w=  -Ageha's route has been butchered so badly in terms of translation half the time I can't even tell what she's saying or what she's referring to, (still hot though)  -The 3D models are nice but I feel their uneeded in terms of the reptitiveness  -For those of you who saw Amane and was like 'I'm TOTALLY GONNA MAKE HER MY WAIFU!!!!' Keep in mind she's   Several years older then you, i think she's like 10-12 years older then you, they never mention her age   a adroable waifu =w=  - You are forced to complete Kotori's route in order to unlock the other heroines routes. That means if you saw Amane's jugs and decided to go for her first, too bad. You HAVE To finish kotoris route, the game won't let you continue to the other's otherwise  - Like all other VN, the common route is unbearably long, feel free to crawl through it  - The skip button  -  You risk your life and the passengers life to chase a cloud =w=    My recommendation for order of routes: Amane's route is pretty much the only route that fully ends the story as a whole compared to all the others  Kotori &gt; Ageha &gt; Asa &gt; Yoru &gt; Amane",

The patches that people are recommending to install, is a real pain to deal with, and I knew from the start would go wrong, the moment I saw the instructions had mentioned needing app locale. Why? Just why?  Nudity was the main reason I bought the game, but because of that, I'm forced to just play the censored version. Seriously, I don't understand why some games with nudity make you jump through hoops just to see the uncensored version, when there are VN's out there that don't censor their stuff this heavily, and ruin things.  Disregarding that complaint, as of writing, I have yet to play the game for even an hour. But seeing from other reviews how this is at least a 30+, I can't really wait that long to give my input on the game so far. It's completely obvious that the team who helped bring this game to life, knew exactly what they were doing when making the game.  As someone new to using Ren'py, seeing the writing and it's other aspects, really makes me realize what a good budget can do for a visual novel. What I've seen of the game has been pretty polished, and I currently have no idea what the other reviews are talking about, when it comes to the translations being bad.   I'm at the point where you meet Ageha for the first time, which according to the game, is at least a half hour inside. So it would be pretty disappointing seeing the quality of the game drop later. That's pretty much all I have to really say on it right now, besides the game now being on sale for significantly less money than I originally bought it for.",

However, I can wholeheartedly say that in my opinion, If My Heart Had Wings was worth the full price paid, and honestly, I wouldn't have minded paying a little more for this title.  The game's story is substantially written, with me sinking in fourteen (14) hours of reading into only a single storyline. Granted, this time includes the necessary filler and build-up work, but the payoff at the end of the storyline I played was well worth the time put into the title. I can't wait to start anew, and if the game is how it looked to be, go through the other potential storylines. However, at the point of writing this review, there were a couple of loose ends in the story (no spoilers, but the motivation of one of the characters isn't resolved), however I'm confident that as with other visual novels of this nature, this will be explored in other avenues.  Further, I am more than happy to say that none of the plot points are rushed or feel unnatural in occurrence. Such as with Nekopara, where several of the scenarios left me wondering, 'Wait, that's it?' or 'The conflict's *already* resolved?', this title takes its sweet time developing the plot, characters, and resolution, starting with the introductions, gradually building the stakes and the bonds between Mr. Minase and, in my case, Ms. Habane, letting all of the buildup release in the climax, then winding down smoothly to the falling action, then ending on a sweet, satisfactory ending.  Now, while I might sound like this game is flawless, there were a couple of hiccups that I noticed. In some spots, the translation gives way to some odd text, and sometimes it is downright incoherent or misleading. Further, while the game has a substantial amount of scenarios to scroll through, there are also instances that did make me wonder if it couldn't be cut for the sake of cutting filler.  All in all, however, I must say that this is a title that I will hold as a treasure on my hard drive. With a title like Nekopara, the allure was there, however there just wasn't enough to warrant me to save it on my computer, and to be honest, while it was a nice momentary distraction, I would feel no loss in deleting it from my library. But, with IMHHW, this one deserves to be put to a disc, so that I might save it in a vault to show future generations what a true visual novel worth the silicone is about. My only fear would be that they would make an unnecessary sequel to this title, as it stands confidently on its own merits, but if this should be the case, I would hope that if this is the case, MoeNovel would do similarly to what Circus did for Da Capo, and put it in the same universe, but with enough time passed to mention the happenings of the first run while leaving it untainted. Final verdict is a solid ten out of ten. If you love visual novels, especially of the romatic nature, with strong character development and one hell of a payoff, this is a title you need to buy as soon as you can.",

Lovable characters, amazing music, questionable friendships. . . ANYWAY, on to the pros and cons.  PROS: - I got it for four dollars! (yay!) - Over thirty hours of gameplay for just one route, much more if you play all the routes. - Very varied conversations based on what choices you select. - SICK intro/outro song. Legit tho, bought the soundtrack just for it. - Awesome music, composed sooooo well for the situations. - Super feelsy, makes me want to cry after each route. - Skip button! (For when you finish a route and don't want to repeat the dialougue).  CONS (It had to come...): - Poor english in some situations. (Especially Ageha route) - Japanese speech only goes along with auto read, so I'd recommend turning it off. (Config, Sound, Voice 0%, makes playthrough a lot more enjoyable) - First little chapter gets SUPER repetetive after the first playthrough! (Thank god for the skip button. . .) - Does anybody actually USE the shortcuts??? - Finally, all stories end, then go to a little scene after the events of the story happen (For example in the Ageha route, you're in school talking about [SPOILERS. . . AGAIN] how you two began dating). For whatever reason, the makers just completely leave these scenes off with a super unsatisfying end! I spent 26 hours on my first playthrough to get the Ageha route, and I'm rewarded with a cutscene of her little sister whining about how I don't love her instead. Great one game.  OVERALL RATINGS: Graphics (characters): 9.8/10 (Fairly sure I found a bug with Ageha's sprite. . .) Story (Only played Yoru, Asa, and Ageha so far): 9/10 Replayablility (Is there a word for that?): 9.4/10 (First chapter is frickin ANNOYING)  OVERALL RATING: 9.4/10  Should you buy this game?

Considering those two points they were only minor things compaired to the story of each path hense why it is at 80/100 or I might even go as high as a 85/100 so a good B.",

You grow with and experience the growth of characters you care about and through my 20 hours I can say every secone was spent with a smile on my face.   However, I feel at a point of the novel the writing standard dropped drastically, there are a few spelling and grammar mistakes which to the common eye don't mean a lot but triggered me intensly at the false use of 'they' if the sentence was written about a single character for instance.  All in all, if your primary motive is to look at sweet anime bresticles this novel is not for you. There I just saved you 20 hours of a torturous form of purgatory where you're trapped in a protaganist that has the personality of a dead cat and is about as responsive to interaction as the prementioned dead cat. It is insanely prolonged in writting and story and to spoil your fun the route I chose (Ageha) the was not any... 'realtions'. If My Heart Had Wings is a fantastic experience for someone wanting to find something a bit different to the common Japanese smut out there but lacks in areas such as story telling and writing to the point I considered putting down the novel entirely. Despite this however, the charm of the art style, music and character depth (that aren't the main protagonist) kept me wanting more. I recommend this novel to anyone with a spare 20hrs to kill or 70 if you want to play seperate routes but do bare in mind if you're looking for hentai all you're finding here is sexual frustration in a neatly packed, well drawn, visual experience.",
