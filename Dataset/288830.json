The Good:  This game has a great story that pulls you in, a great atmosphere that gives some genuine chills, some well done puzzles and the objects that you need to find to use to progress make sense.   The Bad:  A very abrupt cliff-hanger ending that leaves your heroine in peril with no sequel in sight. :-( It leaves you feeling as though you are missing two thirds of the game.  Conclusion:   Although I enjoyed what there is of it, I was very glad that I didn't pay the full price. If you enjoy hidden object games then you will enjoy this one but buy during a sale and be prepared to be very annoyed with the abrupt ending.",

            "review_text": "A nice hidden object/puzzle game. The artwork was lovely, though some of the objects were hard to find based on the descripion (ie looking for 'an ashtray' and it turned out to be a metal frog with a hole on top). It was a good balance of challenging and casual. I like that it indicates when a room has been searched and solved completely by saying 'area cleared at the top'.  The storyline was unique and interesting. It does end quite suddenly with a 'to be continued', but the game was a good length with a good amount of puzzles.  Lots of interactions, great at indicating whats useful, the hint button is useful for finding which direction to go when you're stuck. Overall, this is an excellent example of an HOG for anyone who likes that genre.",

            "review_text": "Ah! I hate cliffhangers! Fair enough if you want to make a series but at least make each game a full story with an over-arching plot that develops over the course of the games (Mystery Case Files and the Otherworld series come to mind) I really liked this game, but that's because I enjoy any game that gets me to do alchemy. Storyline was cool, graphics were lovely and the abilities were a nice touch too. I also like it when I clear a room that there's a sign at the top that says 'Area clear' - makes it easier to figure out what I missed if I get stuck. Overall go for it if it's on sale, but only if cliffhangers don't make you go into a Hulk-style rage.",

Iplay a TON of HOGs and if it sucks me in, to the point of 'marathon'ing it, so to speak, it's a good game. This was one of those. Unfortunately it ends much sooner than I'd like, and hints at a continuation that I'm not sure is ever coming. That's the only downside of this game for me.",
