That is, it's a game of solid skill and knowledge, but with concomitant room for creativity and just generally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tting your way to victory. Quickthinking, general knowledge, expansive vocabulary, and a good sense of humour are what's required to win this game, and even if you barely fulfil any of the listed criteria, you're still going to have an amazingly fun and often hysterical time.  Be warned, however, that the game is low on population. 3-4 player games still make for great fun, however, so don't let that deter you; especially if you have a friend tagging along.",

It's a nice casual break from more involved stuff and is great for a little chill session. Plus, for £4 and endless replayability I think it is an absolute bargin. Very stable and function game, with an attractive GUI that is super easy to use. Dev is very involved online and I am very hopeful for the future of this game and any others he brings out in the future",

Family friendly and can be played in more languages than the game provide with.   The game itself is really clean and easy to find in menu and in-game.  Cons  The game needs like a tutorial because I had trouble in the beggining, but it was fast and easy to learn. Took 1-2 games!",

This is such a fun game where you have five categories, the game will give you a letter and you have to use that letter to come up with a word that you would find in that category! This game is very addicting!",
