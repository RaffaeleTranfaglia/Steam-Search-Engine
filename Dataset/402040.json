The ambiance is chilling and tense.You expect something to happen that doesn't which is, in this game, even better than having actual jumpscares. The puzzles were originals and not too easy or too hard. Yes the game is not that long, but you get value out of each hour... However, when we finished it, we'd still wish there was more!   (Even though I played the game in english, it's the first time I see an option for french OR french-canadian in a game.. I was impressed!)",

I really enjoyed all the puzzles since they were challenging but not hard to understand what had to be done in order to get the result you want. Notes will save you!  The ending for a piece of cake because of my notes ^-^ DO make sure your brightness isn't tooo dark. The only trouble I had in the game was finding a key item I apparently missed! Even with the lamps on I couldn't see the damn thing.   Anyways! Great game! I wish they made more puzzlers like this one.",

I'm only hard of hearing and had to get a refund, as some puzzles require identifying musical notes and matching them. Good game, but totally unplayable if you have any kind of hearing problems.",

            "review_text": "Frustrating yet satisfying puzzle game. I usually write lengthy reviews but I think a shorter one will suffice.   The Guest is a puzzle game in which you are stuck in this room and in escence have to find a way out. Along the way, there are plenty of puzzles that will require you to either use outside items or use logical thinking. The range of difficulty is from fairly easy, to fairly difficult. Nothing is impossible, and there are plenty of red herrings, but as long as you remember the very basic clues that are given, then you should do well. There are plenty of things to grab that you will NOT use, so that can be tricky, and some of the challenges in the later part of the game, can take quite a bit of thinking.    Another thing that I should bring up, is whether this is a horror game or walking simulator. In short, it is neither. It is not a horror game becauase outside of the early on 'bathroom scene', there are no scary parts to it. Creepy? yes very much, but once you restore power to the room and turn on the lights, then things seem less scary. As for walking simulator, there is not that much walking outisde of one section in which you might find yourself walking a LOT more than you would like. Outside of that, there just isn't much walking needed.    Visually the game is a stanard Unity type of game so its nice pretty 3d visuals that run very smoothly. Voice acting is minimal and even then its not that bad I suppose. Music is minimal. There are a few odd bugs though. I got trapped on one puzzle and couldn't exit out of the puzzle, and another time, I had the control key display, stick to my screen and would not remove itself until I reloaded the game.     Overall, this game is a good 3 hour or so puzzle game that is well worth it IF you do NOT cheat or use outside sources. As it stands, there is only one person I think who has finished it but he takes quite a while to do. Everything in the game, is possible to do if you read the clues, use simple logic, and semi-complex logic. My only gripe aside from the few bugs, is that the ending is, nice but cliche although maybe it could lead into a sequel (although doubtful). Still, its a good game for a good price and there should be more games like this.",

            "review_text": "Overall impressions of this game are good.   Pros:  It does a good job of building atmosphere, particuarly at the beginning. There was a distinct feeling of unease for me as I tried to figure out what was actually going on. Early puzzled do a good job of slowly ramping up.  The game is lovely (although I did need to play with the brightness due to bloom - but that's a personal issue), and I found generally played well as far as being able to manipulate objects.   Cons:  Towards the end, some of the puzzles felt obtuse to me. I eventually had to go to a guide to find the answer to one that was required for game completion. While I finished the game, part of that was diminished a little to me since I KNEW that there were two puzzles that were left unsolved. This does mean I'll play it again, but not for the reasons that I would normally like (branching paths/morality choices).   A note to any players who have a hearing imparement: There is a single puzzle that is tone based and is randomized. This has been mentioned as an accessibility issue for hearing impared players (or those who are just tone deaf) in the community, but as of that time I'm writing this I don't believe that it's been addressed.",
