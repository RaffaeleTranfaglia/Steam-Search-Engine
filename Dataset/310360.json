            "review_text": "Higurashi starts off with a bang, and a literal one like that. You expect something interesting with that hook for an opening, but 10 minutes later it feels like you're dragging your feet. The beginning, despite the very opening, is very slow and although I knew this was a big name in the western VN community, I almost put it down. It was a fellow Fuwanovel (a visual novel forum) member who told me to hang in there because it picked up once you got to the festival.  They were wrong.  It picked up quite a bit before that. In my opinion the second Mion pulls out a deck of cards and invites Keiichi (our protagonist) to play a game of Old Maid with the girls, all of the little things that had grated me about each girl before washed away. The sharp eye Keiichi held playing the game engrossed me into the scenario long before the festival was held, before the children, and our main character, had to worry about the real genre at heart--a horror story.  The game ran me about 8-10 hours. There was a little idle time when I got up to go to the bathroom or grab a drink, and I played through the 'Thank you' after bit for the last achievement, but it was still a good 8-10 hours of gameplay that had me laying in bed --mouse in hand-- as late as 5 am wanting to find out what would happen.  This game is $6 for more than 8 hours of enjoyment. I don't know how you could not suggest it to anyone. If you think you enjoy Visual Novels, this is a definite classic among western VN fans and you should check it out. If you like anime, manga or reading, AND you like the horror genre, I'd also hands down reccomend this visual novel.  I think the most off-putting, at a glance, feature of this game is that it's only Ch 1. DOn't be fooled I believe it is technically 15 chapters within this single Ch 1 release. Onikakushi comes from the full game Higurashi no Naku Koro ni. The game itself clocks into the 'Long' range according to VNDB (visual novel database) which is classified as 30-50 hours of gameplay. Ch 1 is part 1 of 4 for this first game compilation so if you were to buy all 4 parts it would be ~$24 dollars, a little less if you follow the series and then pre-order the next 3 games on MangaGamer when they offer it for 10% off. It's only $6 to buy into the series, and if you decide, for whatever reason, you don't like it then it's not much of a loss, if you decide you do VNs for this full length (30-50 hours) normally run you somewhere around $45. Overall it's a really good deal.",

            "review_text": " (With this game you'll be buying the first chapter of the main story of Higurashi out of 8, it'll be about 6-10 hours long, depending of your reading speed.)    Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni  is a great mystery novel with lots of twists to it.  The first chapter is pretty much an introduction to all the despair that's about to fall upon you and our protagonists. I'd recommend grabbing a notebook or opening the notepad on your computer for the next chapters that'll be released in the next few months. The right way to play the series is to take notes throughout your read and to try and decipher the mysteries taking place in Hinamizawa by yourself. You'll be the omnipotent detective, travelling through space and time, and the village of Hinamizawa will look like your playing field,  but in reality you'll be Hinamizawa's puppet, despair shall prevail .  Tldr ;  Is the first chapter out of 8 of this game is worth it's price ?    Absolutely     'I really liked the first chapter of Higurashi, what should I read next ?'  : -  Umineko no Naku Koro ni  : The spiritual sequel to Higurashi. Umineko and Higurashi are independent stories, you don't need to have read Higurashi in order to enjoy it. -  Higanbana no Saku Yoru ni  : Another great work from Higurashi's author. -  And then there were none  : A huge influence of Higurashi's author and another great mystery novel, a masterpiece in itself. -  The Muv-Luv trilogy (Extra/Unlimited/Alternative)  : The greatest work of fiction I've ever came across, it isn't a mystery novel, it's actually science-fiction, but I had to at least recommend it.",

Set in 1983, the story follows Keiichi Maebara as he and his parents move to the quiet, rural village of Hinamizawa. As he settles into his new school and befriends his classmates, Keiichi begins to hear of some gruesome murders that happened in the town a few years prior to his arrival and is naturally interested to find out more. What started out as innocent curiosity leads Keiichi further into a dangerous town conspiracy, and as the paranoia sets in, he soon discovers that those closest to him may be the very ones he should be running from.

            "review_text": "*Note: This is both a (spoiler free) review of the game with some comments about the whole series that will be released chapter by chapter as they are retranslated*  As a huge When They Cry fan I'm glad to see it appear on Steam and hopefully gain the attention it deserves. That it comes with a completely revamped translation (as MangaGamers old translation was filled with bad grammar and formating) and new sprites is just icing on the cake.  Story: Since Higurashi is a Sound novel the story has to be the most important part of the game and it does that magnificently. While the first hour or so of the game is rather slow it then quickly opens up and becomes one of the most paranoia- and horror-filled experiences I have ever read (perhaps only eclipsed by the first arc of it's spiritual sequel, Umineko no Naku Koro Ni). But a note for those who are used to flag based Visual novels where there are occasionally dialogue options that often effect what happens next and what ending you will receive, Higurashi does not contain any choices. Higurashi is instead what is called a kinetic mystery novel where you, as the player, are supposed to read the story and through the hints provided in this chapter and the the other chapters in the so called questions arc (ch. 1-4 with 5-8 being called the answer arc) try to solve the mystery. So, don't expect any choices but instead, pick up a pen and paper, fire up your brain and try to solve this strange case.  Characters: Characters have always been the greatest part of Ryukushi's writing and the characters in the Higurashi is no exception. While, in the beginning, the characters look like normal people if slightly strange and eccentric, as the story moves forward you will get a whole new view of them as the darker parts of their backstories and natures are revealed. And while there are many side characters that doesn't get that much development (or even a sprite) almost everyone else receives at least one chocking reveal and many of the villains are also shown to have at least one sympathetic side to them.  Art: In many Visual novels the art is usualy ranging from decent to fantastic, When They Cry usually put itself on the lower part of the curve. The background is just real photographs (taken in the Japanese village Shirakawa-go) with a photoshop filter and the original sprites are very crude. But in my opinion that doesn't really matter as the main focus is the story, and the characters are mostly there to help you get forward, make you care about them, and in a few cases give out a few laughs with how they look. But as I said above this re-release comes with new character-sprites which the MangaGamer team worked on in coordination with 07th Expansion. I think they look really good and captures the original quite well but on the other hand they do contrast a bit against the background and sadly aren't are expressive as the original sprites (compare Rena's new shocked/embarrased sprites with the originals).  Music: As the name Sound novel implies the music is one of the primary aspects of the game. But while the music in this re-release is better then the one used in the original release (as MG couldn't get permission to use it) it is still rather weak compared to the series from ch. 4 and onward. But that doesn't mean it's bad, it's just not as good as it is later on. The music often fits perfectly with the scenes and the scary scenes are often made even worse by showing that silence is often even more scary than a scare chord, by removing the music during those scenes.  Gameplay: As I noted earlier, there is no gameplay at all in this ''game''. The closest is that after every few chapters a couple of TIPS are opened that you can read. But while you can skip them it is strongly suggested that you read them as they are side stories that are either background material, cryptic discussions or contains further hints to the mystery.  Final thoughts: Of all the stories I have ever read, When They Cry is probably my all time number one and while I consider Umineko to be slightly better, Higurashi is still really good. So if you either want to try out what a Visual novel actually is or just want a good and engaging mystery story with well written characters and a amazing soundtrack in a new and interesting format, pick up this game.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  You are invited to solve this strange case. Will you pick up the challenge or will you give up and leave it unsolved. And if you do pick it up will you succeed to find the truth or will you fail like so many others?  Welcome to Hinamizawa.",

            "review_text": "Higurashi is brilliant and creepy. I loved it and I will be thinking about it for a long, long time, but I had to play it in small doses because it was too intense to play for more than a few minutes at a time. If the next chapter ever becomes available, I intend to grab it immediately.  This is not a game. It's a story, like a novel but with sound and music to enhance the mood, and it is excellently effective. It usually lets you advance the text of the story at whatever pace you choose, but sometimes it takes control and makes you pause in anticipation before revealing the next line. That may sound frustrating, but it is only done rarely and only when it makes the story better. You could never get these sorts of amazing effects from reading a mere novel. I strongly recommend that everyone try Higurashi.  The art is fine and does what it needs to do. It would be nice if there were more poses and more backgrounds to more closely follow the story, but that's a trivial issue. On the other hand, it would not have been a trivial issue if the art had not been upgraded from the original version of the game. During the game you have the option of flipping between the new art and the original art, and the original art is terribly goofy and unacceptable. If I need to play the next chapter using the original artwork, then it's not worth playing. Fortunately the new art is in a clean and conventional style without huge cartoonish exaggerations.  The new art takes away Mion's gun. I never understood why Mion wore a gun; it's such a bizarre fashion choice and removing it can only improve the story.  Overall, this is an amazing experience that fixes the serious flaws in the original version and turns it into a masterpiece.",

The game refers to itself as a prologue and there is too much left unknown by the end that I don't really feel like I have any sense of closure.   With only two parts of the eight parts translated and on STEAM at this time, I'm not sure it would be wise for those on the fence to jump on this now. I might suggest waiting until more have been released and then trying the game when you can either get a bundle or the first couple on sale.  The art itself is great, the characters really likeable and interesting and the mystery is an interesting one, but I'm not sure the game knows what genre it wants to be. The first 2/3's or so is an enjoyable slice of life Visual Novel with the last portion acting as a thriller. I state thriller here because I went in expecting horror, but it really wasn't as scary as I had hoped or expected (and I'm not exactly the bravest when it comes to horror games).   One final piece is that the game isn't really a game in that it does not allow any interactions aside from advanced text and watching some mildly interesting extra scenes called 'TIPS', so bare that in mind if you prefer something a little more active. Even with all this said, I really enjoyed this Visual Novel and would recommend, but the recommendation is a lot more tepid once I've reached the 'end' of this game.",

So much for anime tropes. The first part game focuses on introducing the characters and their antics. Then there is a cultural festival (moar tropes) and something bad happens. Gradually you become aware that there is something going on. The village is not what it seems... They know. They know that you know. And they are coming for you!  I knew little beforehand about the Higurashi series only that it was supposed to be one of THE visual novels. I was probably misinformed that it would be gory, but the game instead focuses much more on suspense, mystery and character driven creepyness.  The graphics are spartan, but the character sprites serve their purpose well. I liked the new redrawn one much more than the original ones (probably would have quit if there had been only the old ones), but the choice is yours. The music was my personal highlight. There are not many tracks, but they hit the spot every time. The story is well written and believable (for horror games). There are however no choices or alternate routes, so there is not much replayability.  Alll in all, a definite recommendation! I'll be getting the second chapter soon and the others, too, when they are released.",

I love the story and the series, but this translations often feels very cumbersome and unnatural as if they had translated the story line by line, never taking time to go back and make sure the pieces fit together, made sense in the context, were of appropriate register, etc. I would recommend this to people who are already in love with the series via the anime/manga/etc and already have an appreciation for the story, but for your first foray into the world of Hinamizawa... you'll probably be surprised that anyone could enjoy such terrible writing. 95% of it is fine, but every 20 minutes or so when you run into that train wreck of a 5%, it's extremely jarring, takes you out of the story, and just makes you want to stop reading.  The fact that it comes with the original Japanese text too is AMAZING, but for the average person probably isn't that useful. It really feels like a release that is targeted at hardcore fans of the series, rather than people looking to pick it up for the first time and that is really a shame.",

Although many people may prefer to go into games blind, I think there are a few things you should know before delving into Higurashi (many people who are familiar with the franchise may know this already. but hey, I didn't).  First, the beginning is long, slow-paced and stupid. But once things finally kick off, it's pretty good. Second, in case you're a fan of visual novels: don't expect any interaction in this like most VNs out there. In case you are not familiar with the genre: expect to read a lot. In fact, reading is what makes the largest part of this game. There are sprites and sound, sure, but in the end you're still in for hours of reading.  This novel has many downsides, of course. The beginning is  excruciating . Narration is really infantile and there are lenghty descriptions of completely irrelevant things. I get what they're trying to go for by setting that extremely cliché anime mood and then revealing, little by little, that life in Hinamizawa isn't all that relaxing and fun, until it gets to a point when it's taken a 180º curve and turned into the creepy mystery story that people are actually here for. But it still would've been better had they cut some of that snooze-inducing crap at the start and inserted something else, like extra material content or CGs.   Anyway, I still recommend it since the story does turn out to be interesting and somewhat creepy. The writing style near the second half of the game, particularly when describing Keiichi's paranoia, is enticing and has just the right amount of detail. However, especially in case you're a fan of horror/mystery and not in for the kyute moe animu grls and school shenanigans, you'll need to be really patient for the first 2~3 hours or so.",

Wait, that's Hot Fuzz. Forget that last part.   So. Higurashi. As someone who has the old Mangagamer hard copies of both arcs, I was pleased to find that the series was getting a shiny new makeover for Steam. Especially when I head about the improved translation. I'm still hoping to hear that this incarnation will get a new hardcopy release. To those who are familiar with the storyline of the series overall, I won't go into details. If you're interested in skipping ahead, the manga release by Yen Press is still available. To those who haven't played Higurashi yet, here goes.  This is a 'kinetic' sound novel. To those uninitiated in the visual novel genre, sound novels rely less on the graphics, and more on the music, sound effects, and atmosphere. As a kinetic novel, you don't make any decisions. Gameplay is just pushing the enter button and advancing the text. In this edition, you can chose between the original sprites, infamous for being cutesy and having boxing glove hands, or more streamlined, professional looking ones.   Hinamizawa is a small town in rural Japan. Tradition looms over this place, where the deity Oyashiro-sama is worshipped by the locals. When Keiichi Maebara moves to this place from Tokyo in 1983, he will make several friends. The ditzy, yet sharp Rena Ryugu. The tomboyish gamer, Mion Sonozaki. The trap master, Satoko Hojo. The serious young shrine maiden, Rika Furude. With their help, Keiichi finds a place in this town. Then he hears a story from several years ago, about a heinous murder that made the news. His friends deny anything happened, but Keiichi finds evidence to the contrary. As Keiichi learns about the yearly death and disappearances that are called Oyashiro-sama's curse, who can he trust? What is happening in Hinamizawa?     On a related note, to look into the tradition of protective gods like Oyashiro-sama,, and stories of spiriting away, I strongly suggest reading Richard Dorson's translations of The Legends of Tono and Folk Legends of Tono.

Second, the story is top-notch. You begin a story full of color and joy. Comedy is the main part of the story at the very beginning but all of that changes soon enough. A dark, gritty story emerges and you are plunged into a very in-depth thriller.  It is one of my favorite anime/manga series and I am glad we finally have the chance to play the original game it came from in English. With the updated sprites and uncut content.",

I won't go to spoilery becuase thts all this is, story. One that horror fans should expereince.This was my first entrance into the series. Not knowing what to expect, i found the first few few chapters of so to be pretty dry. It seemed like a slice of life sort of deal UNTIL the watanagashi. This is the turning point of the story and things start to hit the fan from there. CH.1 starts to sweep some characters under the rug and i was kinda intrested to see how they would play into the whole '♥♥♥♥ hitting fan' situation..but was sad to see they did not get much mention in the later chapters. The horror was pretty intense and the sounds lended themselves pretty nicely, adding diffrent audio distortions really tingled my spine and the overall mystery of what was going on made me keep reading. I kept reading only to be kinda disapointed by the ending..The ending wasn't bad (its pretty dark but not terrible at all) but it jut didn't answer questions that needed answers! After compleing the story the first time, you unock a little 'cast party' thing, which was SUPER great to see and was a really nice pallete cleanser to the events that just hit me like a ton of bricks. (You will all see why if you choose to ake the purchase.)  I really do recomed this VN to anyone who wants to a good mystery..but know that it's just a prolouge with little to no answers in it's conclusion and that there shall be more to come..whenever that may be..please let it be soon..(also that cast party was fantastic imo)",

I'm an anime person rather than a manga person, because I like listening to Japanese voices and watching the gainaxing, among other things. I expected a visual novel to be a step down from anime, but maybe a step above manga. I could not be more wrong; playing Higurashi as a visual novel felt much better than watching the anime! I don't mind that the anime is kinda low budget compared to other popular animes, and I enjoyed it very much. However, I enjoyed the visual novel much more. I got more attached to the characters in the visual novel, which made it much more engaging and feelsy. Also, it is a very different experience playing as Keiichi, rather than watching everyone in the third person. Reading his every thought is an important part of Higurashi that wasn't as strong in the anime. My feelings regarding Ooishi were totally different in the visual novel. Having sprites instead of animation does not detract from a story at all. For Higurashi, it made the characters get under my skin even more. Anyone who is an anime or manga enthusiast should definitely try this game. Anyone who likes Amnesia and thinks they might enjoy visual novels shoud also try this game.",

I usually hate visual novels that don't give you choices or alternate endings... they're just boring. And I'll admit, I wasn't too keen on the original Higurashi VN to start with because of that very reason.... but the story is SO good! There are some things in the visual novel that the anime and manga don't have, so it's nice to play through. And hey, I've heard this story 100 times... and i'm still not bored with it!

Story:  The story is told from the perspective of Keiichi Maebara, a boy who recently transferred to the quiet village of Hinamizawa. About half of the story deals with his daily life, and the other half deals with the mystery.   I personally hated the setting of daily life part of the game. I found most of the main characters annoying/uninteresting (most are along the lines of 'cute anime school girls who do cute things') and I pretty much couldn't connect with any of them other than the MC.   On the other hand, I found the setting for the mystery part of the game great. I liked the whole 'sleepy village in the hills where strange things are happening' aspect, and I thought the details that went into the background really helped to immerse you in the mystery.  It is where the two of these parts come together that really didn't work for me. I have heard that for some, the alternation between the daily life and the mystery parts of the story and the gradual merging of the two as the plot builds up is what makes the whole VN work really well. In my case, I found that the contrast was too great and every time the story switched from the mystery to the daily life part, it lost the momentum that had been built up. My experience with this was probably affected in some part because I did not enjoy/connect with the daily life part of the story. The build up of the mystery plot is also slowed because of the division into the two parts, especially at the beginning of the game, and I was tempted to give up early on because of the balance of the two is so heavily skewed (~90:10 early game) towards the daily life part early on to build the overall setting.  Art:  Pretty average backdrops for a VN, but they do the job and help to visually flesh out the setting. The use of heavily-filtered photos helps the reader to connect for a mystery VN such as this, in my opinion, and the use of different filters also helps to add atmosphere to the mystery parts of the story. The updated sprites look alright but I thought they were not the most appropriate for the characters as they are portrayed. I saw some of the sprites from the PS3 version of the game and they fit a lot better.  Sound:  The text of the story is accompanied by some decent sound effects and music (at times used to great effect for suspense, etc). Wouldn't say that the soundtrack stood out too much.  Overall:  The overall experience provided by this VN was alright/good (6/10), but I would not recommend this game as it just did not work for me. The actual portion of the game dealing with the mystery does not feel all that substantial, and it definitely does not feel worth it for someone who hated the daily life portion of the game.",
