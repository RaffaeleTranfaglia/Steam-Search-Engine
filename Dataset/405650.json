            "review_text": "  Summary:   A small but pointed game that does the job at the price that it's asking for. It's a simple and straight forward game as you simply avoid hazards left and right while trying to make it to the next level. While it had the $10,000 as the draw, I wanna say it didn't need it as it's simple gameplay is complemented by the use of expectation between levels very well. The mechanic of having to go back X amount of levels on failure is helped by the levels feeling so different from each other, yet having a familarity in them as well. It uses the content it has very well as contrasted against itself, and it's only helped by a strong visual aesthetic. The soundtrack, while not my cup of tea persay, definitely does the job in terms of action oriented gameplay. While I'd like to see more levels and some other game modes in the long run, for 3 bucks, it's hard not to say the game is worth it, as it reminds me of the simplicity of games like Super Hexagon, while keeping the action up. Worth a look.    Gameplay Footage and Video Review:         YouTubeâ„¢ Video:  Zero Reflex (Fly By): Simple But Effective&nbsp;",

Ninja stars, sawblades, pink tentacles, snakes and more stand in your way for a glorious $10,000.   You think you can beat this under an hour, 'Oh, I've played Undertale/CoD/Any game about dodging, I sure know how to dodge bullets!'  I thought the same, and here I am cursing a giant eye still in hard mode.  EDIT: The contest is over. If you want to challenge yourself get this game. Otherwise it's just a rage game over an eyeball.",

            "review_text": "Interesting little shmup. It doesn't seem terribly difficult, though one level in particular keeps reking me. Hard mode levels seem identical to normal levels only with only 2 lives, so I would hope the last 20 are mechanically more difficult.   The main problem I find is that controls are slightly too floaty for a shmup game. Imprecision leads to more deaths than the game actually being hard.",
