So if you can host a private server and get a couple of your friends to play, then this game is awesome!  Great for fans of the original Half-Life. Not so good for people who just wanna play. There are much more people playing the original Half-Life Deathmatch and not the Source 'remake' version. Just don't expect to find anyone playing on a Public server.",

And how grateful I am that I did, it's gameplay is simple, but still fun, there isn't anything competitive and it just feels like a breath of fresh air from highly competitive games like LoL, Dota, CS and COD. Playing this felt so good and refreshing with no one raging or hacking and there isn't even voice chat to bear risk of driving everyone mad. The 15 or so people that play this game come and go, being happy and silent as the familiar scramble to the nearest weapon becomes a new chalenge of getting those guns off the person who has the most.  Classic Deathmatch the way it should be, to be played casually or religiously, 10/10",
