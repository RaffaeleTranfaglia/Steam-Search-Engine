            "review_text": "I originally purchased this game when it was released in 1996, and it quickly became one of my favorite RTS titles of all time. Z eliminates most of the tedium that usually comes with RTS games, choosing to focus on tactics and management of assets. The gameplay is relatively straightforward. Each map is divided into territories, which the player must capture. Territories contain assets like factories and radar stations. The more territories a player controls, the more quickly their factories produce units. More powerful units require more time to construct. Players must marshal their forces and constantly keep them moving in order to succeed.  I was very excited to see this classic title released on Steam, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys the RTS genre, robots, and irreverent humor.",

            "review_text": "Needs improvement, but it's very similar to the old Z. Similar (if not identical) gameplay, same videos, sounds, music, levels, etc. Most reviews are brutally negative, and although some have good points, others are missing the target.   Controls: Yes, indeed, they are weird, but I got used to them very quickly. You select units with left-clik and give orders also left-clicking. When you give an order the unit is unselected but I think the original Z did that too (but not Zod Engine). Orders can also be general, so units will automatically attack, pick up grenades, etc. Right-clicking is used for dragging and creating complex units of different soldiers, vehicles, etc, like in many RTS games you use ctrl + number. It's not true, however, that they stick together forever. If you want to select a unit inside a 'army' right click that unit, and then you can issue normal orders just to that unit. You can also click an icon in the botton of the screen (looks like two robots) and that will eliminate the complex unit.  Oh, if you want to attack the ground (to destroy a bridge, building or just shoot random animals) ctrl+left-click.   Improvement: You should be able to pan with wasd or movement arrows. Also, although I don't have much of a problem with them, if you could change controls to be more like a normal RTS that would be an improvement.  Zon Engine: Many people have compared this game to the free version Zod Engine. ZE is amazing, but it's a multiplayer experience and is suited for that and for people who like tinkering. Playing with map_list &amp; default_settings you can create almost a new game with your friends, but it's not an engine for new people to Z. In fact, I still don't know how to savegame in ZE (I think you can't) and the original videos aren't there. Heck, even if you lose, you go to the next map.   If you want multiplayer (and editing and tinkering) ZE is not only the best, it's the only alternative. However, if you want a single player experience similar (or identical) to the original game, this is pretty close.  Other problems: (1) Language. Spanish doesn't work well. Sound is OK, but the menu is in some language I thought was italian but now I don't know if it even exists (easy- &gt; fácil -&gt; ¿Fécil?). Hints and descriptions seem to have been translated by a machine.  (2) Better resolutions would be a welcoming improvement but I don't any problems about that and widescreen works well for me.  (3) Very minor: Achievements. They are not good (build that unit, finish that level, etc.) but I guess Z doesn't have room for much improvement in that regard.  (4) Editor: That would be amazing.  (5) Expansion: ZE has the expansion, 11 new levels.",

            "review_text": "Z is a Real Time Strategy game from 1996, the same year that Diablo and Quake 1 came out, and the Steam release was not a “remastered” or HD version. You get the same game from almost 20 years ago. All the same, Z was never about the graphics, it’s about rapid blitzing to control the map in what is essentially a real time strategy capture the flag game.  Z doesn’t really have a story in its campaign. The opening cut scene (all of them actually) is of 2 idiot robots piloting a small space ship around following the instructions of Commander Zod, who is sort of like a drill sergeant robot commanding the red colored army (the enemy is all blue robots). The cut scenes don’t really have anything to do with the gameplay; they’re just there to add some comic relief between the levels since frantic blitzing can be stressful. In fact, the cut scenes actually repeat themselves several times throughout the campaign, with only minor differences such as background (snow, desert, etc.)  In each level, you and your computer controlled opponent start on opposite sides of a square map divided into a rough grid. Each grid has a flag and possibly some sort of unit production factory. When you touch the flag with any of your units, the grid block becomes yours and the factory automatically builds units for you one at a time. A very important note is that the more grid blocks you control, the faster units get produced. This means that you should always grab the flag, even if you can’t hold it, because during the short time you own it, all your other factories are producing slightly faster and your enemy is producing slightly slower. Also, if you manage to capture a flag right before the enemy’s unit is finished building, the unit will come out of the factory on your team, the build clock does not reset.   To win the game, you don’t actually need to control all the grid blocks, you just have to destroy the enemy fort, which is a very large factory on the opposite side of the map from you. Of course, if you control the whole map, you’ll be pumping out units fast enough to squash the enemy easily while they have to wait 10 minutes for a measly grunt unit. As for the types of units you can build, there are about 15 all in all, including some base defenses if you would rather turtle in your territories than go out capturing new ones. From my experience though, all you really need are light tanks and toughs (missile infantry).   Pros: +Nostalgia! I played this game close to 20 years ago and only ever got to try the shareware. I finally got the chance to finish it.  +Some humor, not much, but it helps with the repetitive gameplay. The rapid deployment and almost total focus on offence prepared me for future games like Company of Heroes, where you need to attack, attack, attack.   Cons: -The game is damn old, and the graphics are terrible. It’s hard to tell the infantry units apart until you click on them and see the name. Also, the game seems to run at a flat 15 frames per second (just guessing). -Also related to the game’s age: The controls are clunky. Everything is controlled by the mouse left click button. The map scroll is very slow so if you need to move your vision around the map, you need to click on the mini-map or it will take forever.  Overall, if you remember Z from the good old days and always wanted to play it, now’s your chance. The game has about 25 Steam achievements and they can all be very easily obtained in one “easy mode” play through. But if you have backlog and a list of games you’ve been wanting to try out, leave Z until later on your list.  ",

            "review_text": "This is a re-release of the classic RTS Z. The game has no base building. The way you build an army is by capturing territories, which control factories, and the factories automatically produce units on a timer. There are no different races either, it's pretty much a robot army civil war. The game is known for its tense pace and high difficulty. Finishing this game back in the day was something to really brag about in the schoolyard. You need to move fast and intelligently pick which units to send where and against what. Bunching up your entire army early in the game and just going from flag to flag will lead to certain defeat, so you need to split each squad, jeep and tank and choose which territories to grab first and how to proceed from there. This makes the gameplay feel very dynamic. Each map of the campaign plays very differently as well.  Things to be aware of: There is no multiplayer, only a campaign (which is however very well designed). There is no skirmish mode. It runs on Win 7 just fine. They have not reworked the resolutions, so during gameplay 60% of your screen is covered by black bars. They have added difficulty selection, which was not there in the original version. Scrolling the map feels a bit sluggish and weird sometimes. The controls are right click to select units/group up units and left click to make them move/attack (might feel a bit confusing if you are used to Blizzard controls). You cannot rebind anything.   Conclusion: Z is considered a classic for a reason. It's a very tense and challenging strategy game which plays great even today. This is a reissue, not a remake, it works well on modern operating systems, but don't expect anything more. However, I think that for 5 euros it is definitely worth getting and playing through the campaign, so I will give it a thumbs up.",

            "review_text": "Z was initially released by the Bitmap Brothers in 1996, and overshadowed by the titans from 1995, Command &amp; Conquer and WarCraft II. Back at that time, Real-time Strategy games were still trying to break new ground and each was trying to innovate in its own way. Which meant exciting games with their own spin on the formula... but still a lack of an established 'great user interface/RTS controls'.  Z innovated with a map divided by areas to capture, and no base building. The unit factories are pre-determined on the territories, meaning that no two maps will play the same. An usual RTS goes like this: gather ressources, build an army, conquer. In Z, the player has to start by quickly capturing territories and key vehicles around to provide the next reinforcements and establish dominance on the map, and be attentive to any hole in the enemy defenses. Some games can go very quickly with a Blitzkrieg leading to a snowballing advantage and victory within 5 minutes, while some games can lead to a standoff where both armies will have to build up some firepower.  The result is a very gripping and dynamic game, in which every single tactical decision counts. Without base building, the player is directly in the action.   There is not much of a story to talk about, but the atmosphere of the game is quite endearing with robots commenting on the action or talking to the player (also with each type of robot having their own AI, from stupid to clever, reflected in their in-game decisions), very nice and bright graphics, and many cutscenes.   Overall, Z is a unique and fun RTS, that only suffers from controls that are a little bit outdated. The interface is not great, and it can make the player feel like the computer has the advantage to be able to be everywhere at once.  However. As much as I like Z itself (and not the terrible sequel, Steel Soldiers), and being able to play it on modern systems with a high resolution, this port is technically bad and plagued with issues. The AI can be worse than the original with robots getting stuck in position (especially if a bridge is destroyed), the scroll speed is so slow that I ended up using only the minimap to navigate (WASD or arrow keys would have been my preference for movements in a specific area), the interface has not been improved (really a pain to scroll through all the available units that a factory can provide until choosing the one we want, there is no rally point for factories and no queue order whatsoever) and there are still the clunky old RTS controls that were so imperfect before StarCraft, the menus are terrible (don't forget to save when you start a mission, I was not able to scroll down in the mission select menu), there is no multiplayer (for multiplayer, check out the open source remake named Zod Engine). The only substantial addition, besides the resolution, is the possibility to select a difficulty level.  I find that Z is a great game that would have deserved a better port, and controls more suited to modern standards. I am very mixed on this recommendation...",

(jeep, medium, heavy so far seem to be okay haven’t go far enough yet to see the mo missile).  -The players AI units don’t seem to be very smart (snipers, toughs, grunts) the rest seem to be okay so far.  -Buildings if destroyed seem to have lost their textures.  Some Features id really like to see:   Level builder and be able to share your maps on the steam workshop  Multiplayer is a MUST  Thats all i can really think of so far",

Pathfinding and unit AI are still atrocious, units will stop and refuse to move for no reason, plan crazy routes, get stuck in broken bridges instead of making a detour, walk straight into a wall, refuse to shoot, etc. etc... During cutscenes sound will temporarily disappear. Music could use some improvements, sometimes it is very repetitive. Screen scrolls slowly for some reason, with much lower framerate than it should have.

Sadly this is not a PC remake, but just a mobile platform port with all the limitations of a mobile platform... It just doesn't feel right to have an UI, designed for a Phone or a Tablet on a PC.  Horrible controls for PC. AI bugs especially with path finding (worse than the ones in the original game). etc.  There are huge problems especially with Infantry Units' movement and firing. Also the Toughs' projectiles seem to be buggy compared to the original game. Unit AI is kind of weird. often Infantry Units get stuck near objects. When near enemy units often only one troop member attacks. The other ones are just walking around.  Cursor selection and utility needs some improvements. Especially with turret guns. Often you make a robot leave a defensive turret by accident.  Also you took away the possibility to make a rotating defensive turret keeping watch towards a direction of an approaching enemy, because you no longer can give an attack order out of the turrets range. This is taking away a lot of power from turrets. This was never a bug in the original game! It was a good micro management feature!  The lack of a multiplayer is somehow disappointing. Even the original game had one in 1996(!).  I know my review sounds harsh. But I am a software dev myself and I grew up with games like Z. Don't get me wrong. I think the idea to do a Z remake is great and I respect your attempt to do so. But a mobile platform port won't do the trick for a Z audience.  In Conclusion it is definetly a nice game to play on your smartphone or a tablet while being bored, travelling by train, sitting in a bus or something similar. But it's just not right for a PC experienced Z audience.   If you want to have the real Z feeling, get the original game and emulate it. Or even simpler, get the Zod Engine. It is basically a 1:1 remake of the old Z, with better controls and a working multiplayer! And it is free!   The Developer of Zod Engine did it alone. You should`ve hired that guy.  Edit: After further testing I found out there is a bug with tanks as well. If you give them an attack order with 2 enemies in it's range it will always attack the closest one, no matter wich one you told him to attack. And at least alter that UI a bit...",
