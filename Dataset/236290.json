It's sorta like a mix of Zuma and Bust a Move. It's the type of game that you could put your mom on and not see her for hours.  NOMINATED FOR VILLIAN THAT MOST NEEDS A HUG (Because he's a cute fluffy kitty!)",

The gameplay itself is a no-brainer.   Replayable :  No. I would not have gotten this for myself in the first place -- it was gifted to me as a joke. And that's exactly what this game is.",
