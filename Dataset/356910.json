A few are good for setting up elaborate attackes over time, Watson namely, others do massive combos, and a few just go with well timed simple moves for a different skill based tactic. Great visuals, but still clean, and a decient story. I for one have really enjoyed so far.",

It’s not a very good port; it’s also not very well optimized. It has a proto Guilty Gear Xrd 3D to 2D visual, in which the characters are actually 3D models, but since the cell shading isn’t as aggressive and the color palette more on earth tones it doesn’t look as good as it might. The characters are fun and well designed, but there are some that have way easier move set to combo, which make them top picks, while others are clunky and need a lot of time and practice to get anything done with them.
