            "review_text": "I'm copying most part of this review from my  Flesh Eaters  review. If devs aren't bothering with making a unique game, why would I bother writing a unique review?  Ah, another encounter with the Back to Basics publisher. A publisher that's not really known to players, cause he keeps his doings shady, but some of the more observant people may know him, them, it, whatever you call it. This establishment keeps pumping out cheap games, each made in a few weeks, with the very same textures, no significant gameplay, no storyline, no unique sounds even. How they keep these similar games and not breaking any Steam rules is beyond me, but okay, let's move on to the game.  What do we have here? Another unfinished game, with the very same art as their other titles:     Kivi, Toilet and Shotgun. Check the characters, textures, sounds, particles, weapons and the overall feel of the game.    Flesh Eaters  Yet again, check characters, textures, weapons, particles, camera, sounds and overall feel.   This game has bugged mechanics, top-down perspective and a feel of a product that has been made during a day off by a lazy programmer, using some stolen art from some other project (I won't be surprised, if that's the exact case here).  There is a single player campaign, yet it's so insignificant (and unfinished), that there's nothing to actually play with. If you do enjoy unfinished products with no quality whatsoever, buy it. If not, just move along.",
