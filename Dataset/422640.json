            "review_text": "I'd love to actually play this game, but the current control system is broken. I tried racing and my driver kept steering off in different directions even when not touching the Vive touchpad. Conversely, it would sometimes stop steering even when using the touchpad. There also doesn't appear to be any support for driving wheels, whereas the Rift version advertises that support.  There is also no in-game representation of the Vive controllers even in the menu. This makes it difficult to know exactly where on the track pad you are pressing, since you have no visual feedback, but they still divide the trackpad into multiple buttons.  It's disappointing how something as basic as getting the controls wrong can break an otherwise promising looking game.  Updated: I tried it with an Xbox 360 controller and that worked fine. It was actually controllable. However, the game did not specifically indicate it could use an Xbox controller; the custom controller setup also only seems to work with the Xbox controller but not the Vive controllers.",

I Havent tested network play or how many levels in game yet but this definetely feels like a game worth playing unlike most of the VR titles out so far,  Been disappointed with the lack of content on VR but its looking like the tide is about to change.",
