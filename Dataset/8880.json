They unleash a powerful catalyst — Energy X — that imbues the planet's worst miscreants with super-powers to bring the planet to its knees. Now Earth's only hope lies with a new breed of heroes... The Freedom Force!",

            "review_text": "All you need to do is ask yourself how many games can you pick up a taxi cab and throw it at a mobster or beat giant robots with lamp-posts. Does that sound like fun to you? If so this could be right up your ally.   I must have played over 400 hours of this game heck maybe even more, I re-bought it here on steam as my old disk became unable to load after 15 years of dragging it in and out of the CD rom.. It is a wonderful delight for any old comic book fan. the characters are campy like the old batman/superman tv shows. The stories are fun and characters are a hoot.   Characters like the fun loving sea urchin, or the speedy southern boy 'Bullet.' Mentor the master of mind control or Melancholy 'Man-Bot' will keep you going through the different stories and invested in the them The only thing better than the characters are the villains, and the guy narrating does a great job. The game has many short stories, which play like episodes and they all lead up to a final showdown, worth getting too. (20-30 hours on average i would say)  The game has massive re-playability with leveling different characters, I think there are 12+ and you could play through the game 10 times and still have more characters to try. Not to mention the many character combo's and who to use the XP canisters to level up more. Leveling up certain characters can really makes them shine and give a whole new way to play them. Mixing and matching can lead to tons of different ways to play the levels. Who you bring on each mission, and which ones you give canisters too can really change the whole feel of the game.   I will say, the interface and game play takes a lot to get used to, if you aren't familiar with the older GUI's from the 90's it can be tough. But once you figure out how the hits work, and AOE powers and such, it really is fantastic. Just play the game in win98 Compatibility and run as an Admin and you should have no issues, but some do, and I am not sure why. Try reading some of the trouble shooting tips if you are having issues. Outside of the getting to run issue, I have very rarely hit a bug, and typically when they happen you can restart the mission and you should not see it again. Just remember to make a save after or before each mission just in case, as the auto-saves are not very often.  This is one of my favorite games ever made, while FFII, was good, it just is not as good as the first. But if you do like this one, I highly recommend the sequel as it really is more of the same with some better balance. The second is a bit shorter, and is lacking in the amount of new characters. The game is more of a continuation that feels like an expansion verse the whole game of the first. That said, it really is to bad that Irrational never made a third because even an expansion of this to me is better than tons of stuff out there on the market. Maybe one day, but till then try it.. The game is 'Antastic!'  (there is also a GoG version now that fixes the dread cursor bug, so you might wan't to take that into consideration)",

            "review_text": "Whimsical is probably the best game which can be used to describe this game. Set in an alternative history where random individuals were given super powers, they decide to become super heroes and villains, and the sort of stories we normally see in comic books are what results. You control a squad of these do-gooders over the course of the campaign, and level them up how you see fit through all sorts of random adventures. Combat is real-time, albeit with pause. I only played through the single player (I presume the pause is not present in multiplayer), but the controls basically feel like a very early form of what is now considered the norm in MMOs.  All in all, it's a fair bit of fun. It's old, and so comes with the general baggage one would expect, but it's an excellent example of gaming from the time and can still be fun to boot up.",

Good replayability with loads of characters to level up, skill sets and a comprehensive create-a-character.  - It's a bit buggy, save often. The sandbox element is at once it's greatest strength and most annoying weakness - throwing cars and punting guys with telephone poles never gets old but most of your heroes don't take kindly to the same treatment. You really need to watch all of them all the time.  Just try not to rage at the flying policemen... ('I am above the law!')",

            "review_text": "Windows 8.1 or 10? Don't bother.  From what little I've played, it seems like a great game-- however, due to compatibility issues this game is downright unplayable. The pathfinding is just broken so that you'll indefinitely run the wrong way and have to click 3 times in arbitrary points to do any interaction, and the game is very prone to softlocking. This is especially problematic as WHEN (not if) the game softlocks and crashes, it locks your cursor, meaning either restarting your computer or going through Task Manager with Ctrl-Shift-Esc and keyboard controls without looking at the screen will be necessary just to close the game.  I'm definitely glad I got this from a Humble Bundle, otherwise it would have been a huge letdown. Even then, it's disappointing because these problems stand in the way of what seems to be a genuinely great game. Go buy it on GOG instead, from what I've read they fixed the problem. The 1.3 version Steam has is broken on Windows 8 and above, and quite possibly 7 as well, so once again, GOG is the first place you should look for old games. Accept no substitutes.  On the bright side, the sequel 'FF vs. the 3rd Reich' seems to be fine on modern systems, even with the Steam version. You're still a fool if you buy it on Steam instead of GOG, but hey, you'll be a fool with a working game.",

I couldnt even get through the first mission without the unit pathing and player controls flipping out in gamebreaking ways. Doesnt seem to be much support (or any) from the publishers or makers of the game.   I am running windows 7 and have tried running in various compatibility modes and messed with all kinds of things to try to get this game playable but I havent been able to get it working well enough that I can tolerate all the issues.  This could be a great game to remake or for the publishers to fix up and re-release but until then save your money (or buy xcom or a Marvel superhero game or something else thats similar instead!). I loved this game as a kid but in its current state its just not worth your money.  Valve should be a bit embarassed for promoting (putting on sale!) stuff like this without checking if its actually playable. With a 90% metacritic review, and reasonable price, I bet a ton of people have bought this only to discover they've thrown money away on something completely unplayable.  I hope the new refund policy helps people avoid traps like this and helps games like this get cleaned up or get taken off the store. I purchased this years before the refund policy so I doubt they will honor it, but I will be pursuing a refund on this one.   ",
