            "review_text": "The following is a review of the game from a long-time Resident Evil fan.  Resident Evil Revelations 2 is a decidedly low-budget affair, it's not particularly graphically impressive and there is a level of jank to it all. However, behind this lays what may be one of the stronger Resident Evil games in years that manages to be a solid episodic title, a solid survival-action game, and more atmosphere and horror-oriented and feeling more like 'Resident Evil' than probably the last several RE games combined.  Now I say that as someone who actually liked Resident Evil Umbrella+Darkside Chronicles, RE5, Revelations 1, and Resident Evil 6 well enough for what they were. RE5 and RE6 were fun action co-op games for me, RE5 was a fun arcade shooter with some fun monsters, RE6 had some fun combat mechanics with a sort of uneven-quality campaign but great Mercenaries. Revelations 1 was okay, I enjoyed it well enough, but its handheld origins showed strongly and really, the design of the game was kind of dull at times, and it never quite gave that classic Resident Evil feel it claimed it would. But Raid Mode was a joy for me.  However, I think with this title it's helped me better understand what element is missing from those games, besides the obvious flaws that something like Resident Evil 6 has, Revelations 2 comes as something of a reminder of elements of RE I deeply appreciate and love that have been mostly absent in recent years. That's not to say this is some complete return to form or a classic-styled survival-horror game, but it recalls back to the older series while also not quite feeling it's living in the past.  While the graphics leave some things to be desired, the sound design is well-handled. It doesn't quite have the memorable moody tunes of the original series, but the dynamic shifts of the music, the audio design of ambiance and monsters is well-handled, with good depth of audio for headphone users, and a good layer of subtlety which help propel the title further to a more engaging experience.  This is a much slower experience than recent Resident Evil's. That's not to say it doesn't have its action-full moments, but even those comparatively to recent RE titles feel more constrained and leveled, and a lot of the time you find yourself scouting locations, looking for hidden items, sneaking past or onto enemies with a new stealth system (that's a bit flawed sometimes, but functional).  Before I continue, I shall mention like I do with most Resident Evil titles, I played this game on the hardest difficulty available from the start, Survival. I did my first run in Revelations 1 on Infernal, I played RE6 on Professional on the 360 before No Hope existed. However, this is probably tied for me right now with Code Veronica as the most challenging RE on Hard difficulty. Revelations 1 had some artificial difficulty spikes on Infernal (the first chapter and final boss fight come to mind), but this feels more like a challenge. I've discovered Survival both lowers the amount of ammo you get, and adds specific trickier enemy placements. I wouldn't recommend it for the easily frustrated, but for those who like a challenge and an amplified survival element, I would recommend it.  And maybe in part to this I found the game to have a bigger survival aspect than the recent RE's, I found myself struggling more for ammo and health than I can recall in any recent survival-action, horror, or the like games. Even in a lot of older RE's I would be stockpiled with a lot of supplies past the very beginning, but here I found myself aching for specific ammo types and herbs on a number of occasions. But not to my lament, I found it a joy, with the slower-pace. The lack of constant action with more of a focus on survival and playing more intelligently and preservative brought back certain feelings I haven't felt from the series in a while.  The element I was most surprised by though was the story. This isn't some masterfully crafted tale, but the story feels like a Resident Evil story. One of the single most disappointing elements of RE6 and Revelations 1 for me happened to be their narratives, the characters lacked playfully fun tones often, the files were a bore, the stories delved into the ridiculous, and not in a good way, and often came up as boring and forgettable. This game has single-handily pushed Barry as one of my favorite characters in the series, had a child character in Natalia that is actually not annoying and enjoyable, the ridiculous cussing of Moira actually didn't totally turn me off from her character and she became likable by the end of it, and it has what in my opinion is the best villain the series has had in years. Claire unfortunately is missing some of her charm from RE2 and Code Veronica, but I also find herself in this game fairly unoffensive. Unlike the first 'Revelations', this game actually feels super connected with the rest of the series, episodes end with actually impactful cliffhangers, and the overall story feels like actual revelations to the series that makes me interested to see where they take it in the future. The story managed to be enjoyable throughout, make me care, make me laugh, and unexpectedly delivered a few moments that put me on the bit of the edge of feelsy and realizing I actually like these characters, something no recent RE has been able to afflict on me.  It's also notable that there's only a small handful of QTEs in the game, that aren't harmful, and it happens to be the only game I can think of that got forced walking sections correctly. That's usually a huge game design sin for me, but the moments are very rare and when it happens it both makes sense and actually works.  One of the game's finer strengths is its monster design and encounters. Some of the monsters found in the game are among some of my favorites in recent RE's, and they're backed with memorable and some of the most tense encounters I feel in the series history. Boss encounters are infrequent, but the few that are here managed to be good ones in my opinion, with a few maybe being some of my favorite tense boss encounters in the series. While not specifically a chainsaw, this game probably has my favorite 'chainsaw enemy' since Dr. Salvador, and a boss fight in Claire's Chapter 3 is a fun and wonderfully RE-styled boss fight. I even thought the final boss was the best final boss the series had seen in the last few years, and I agree with others, the good ending was probably the best ending a Resident Evil game has had in over a decade.  Then there's small touches that bring the game together. Certain things you do in Claire's scenario affects Barry's, some being as subtle as picking up ammo and herbs not making it available for Barry/Natalia, to minor cool things, like turning on the flamethrower to aid Claire in episode 1 causes there to be an additional obstacle in Barry's episode 1, to nice subtle things like a certain monster you can fight or run from in one of Claire's episodes will change completely what Barry has to do or encounter... The episodes get progressively better in my opinion, and some of the later stuff feels a lot like older RE, including a few light, easy, but fun puzzles in episode 3, and a certain fun section in the last episode...  One disappointing thing is, despite spending hours in it already and enjoying it well enough, I think I've concluded that Raid Mode in Revelations 2 I don't find as enjoyable as Raid Mode in Revelations 1. There's aspects I like about it more, like character-specific abilities, the new monster buffs, the higher number of stages... But most of the stages being from RE6, as well as just not as well designed or varied as Revelations 1, and the whole thing lacking an over-arching fun challenge like Ghost Ship, I think is deeply felt.  Probably the most 'Resident Evil' the series has felt in years, and a fantastic budgeted spin-off.",

            "review_text": "First things first, I would only suggest getting the big bundle for this game otherwise you are just wasting money.  Alright so this is great bundle of resident evil goodness. Much better then RE5 and RE6 unless you were looking for a really good coop experience then RE 5 would be better I suppose. As a pure resident evil game its the best since RE4. It is nowhere near as good as RE4 but RE4 is one of my favorite games of all times so thats not really a black mark on this one.  For the price you get alot of content. There is an absolutly awesome raid mode that you can spend at least 100 hours in just completing all the different missions and it is a ton of fun.   The single player is also very good. The atmosphere is pretty nice and the enemy designs are cool and creepy. Levels are a bit too linear, but not overly so. Coop is in this game as well though you can only play single player locally and only one person gets to shoot things which is pretty lame imo. The single player will last around 10 - 12 hours but considering you get the raid mode and a beefy single player the 30 price is well worth it for this great game.  For RE fans this is a must buy. For those looking for a decent bloody shooter with alot of content and good gameplay this is a good choice for you as well. ",

            "review_text": "Finally, after 7 patches, and the release of all 4 episodes (and the 2 bonus episodes), I am ready to change my original negative review and recommend it. That said, I still have complaints, most notably the microtransactions present for Raid Mode, but that aside, the game is quite good. I am also still unsatisfied with how long it took before multiplayer was implemented (still waiting on multiplayer for the campaign), and the fact that the game was released episodically. That said, at least we now have everything here, which is great. Capcom has also fixed a lot of the FPS, stuttering, and crashes which plagued me on release, so bonus points there too.  A pretty big fan of Resident Evil, if not all Horror games, I greatly enjoyed the gameplay and setting of Resident Evil Revelations. It was good to see the return of Barry and Claire, though I wouldn't have minded seeing more Jill and Ada. Staying true to its history of strong co-op elements, Revelations 2 builds upon this extensively. Whereas in previous Resident Evil games, including the first Revelations, you merely fought with 2 characters, in this one, co-operation between your two characters (Claire and Moira, and Barry and Natalia) is paramount, and the different mechanics of the two characters and how they interact is the standout feature of this game. Forcing you to switch between the two to progress, and with a slew of now customary puzzles, the campaign is solid. But it is in Raid Mode that Revelations 2 truly shines. Having greatly enjoyed the freedom provided by Raid Mode in the first Revelations, I eagerly anticipated the second iteration, and once I could finally play it, I was not disappointed (except for the microtransactions). Great fun, and with multiple characters, weapons, and skills, Raid Mode offers virtually endless replayability. The genuine atmospheric survival horror, and the soundtrack complement the gameplay to produce a worthy addition to the Resident Evil franchise.  In contrast though, the graphics, particularly of the enemies, looks a bit sub-par. The environments and locations look great... but the enemies... slightly less so. While Raid Mode is the best part of the game, microtransactions included, it is seriously grindy, especially if you want to unlock everything. Each character needs to be leveled up separately, and you, as the player, also have a separate EXP system as well. Then there are the skills and in-game cash you need to acquire too. That said, the game is still great fun.",

I've met the system requirements for this game, yet the game can't be play. This game is POORLY optimized, and a horrible practice on capcom's part. You're a huge gaming company, act like it. This is an inferior product comparing to other the platforms then on PC. These problems should of have been dealt with before release.

            "review_text": "It's not revolutionary or particularly innovative, and you're pretty much always aware it's a 'budget' title for the series, but Resident Evil Revelations 2 is a rock-solid addition to the franchise, and I hope that RE7's seemingly drastic new direction doesn't mean we'll never see something like this again.  The main campaign is relatively long if you take your time to explore every area. It's kind of a mixture of classic and modern RE gameplay - it isn't exactly terrifying and it's still action-horror (you probably won't find yourself running out of ammo too often), but a lot of the tension and dark, grimy environments bring back a bit of that old school feel. It's definitely a little more reserved than Resident Evil 6.  You'll be switching between two fairly separate storylines, and each of them has two playable characters. This includes Barry Burton, who makes his first canonical appearance since the very first game, and is arguably one of the best protagonists the series has had recently, as he manages to be a 'badass' while still actually feeling like a human being instead of some kind of completely invincible action hero.   There's a decent amount of variety between the various playstyles - you'll generally have one character that's useful for scavenging for ammo and hidden items, and another that handles the weapons and the rest of the dirty work. This, plus the fact that you can switch between two characters on the fly, means that unlike RE5 and 6, it's actually a completely valid option to play this on your own instead of co-op, although the (offline) option for that is also there.   The campaign would be enough for me to recommend RER2, but the action-focused Raid Mode ensures that it can potentially provide hours upon hours of content - and a surprisingly hefty amount of it is available even if you just buy the first episode. Practically another game in and of itself, it's somewhat addictive and has online co-op to boot.  Nobody plays Resident Evil for its highly intellectual storytelling, but - probably at least partly due to its episodic nature - there's even an attempt to come up with a fairly interesting plot here. Coming from someone who rarely even takes notice of story in video games, I think this is the only time I've found myself being somewhat invested in the story of a Resident Evil game. It doesn't really resolve itself in the best possible way when everything's said and done (there's also a good ending and a bad one, depending on a choice you make in Episode 3), but for my money it's still more compelling than most of the plotlines from the rest of the series.   Oh, and feel free to install the film grain removal mod... the game can be a bit of an eyesore without it.",

            "review_text": "1. Optimization has definately improved from launch, this can be seen especially in two raid mode levels stage 3-3 (and 5-2 to a lesser extent) was basically unplayable with massive frame rate drops and now runs smoothly. (yes even after they screwed it up and fixed it again, sniper scoping still seems to be unattended to.)   2. The game feels just like resident evil 4 which some people will complain about and some will absolutely love, this one is up to personal preference.  3. Offline co-op is fully instated into the game for story, however two controllers are needed for this, online co-op is instated for raid mode only, capcom has said time and time again that there will not be any online co-op for the campaign, which is sad considering my next point.  4. The one and only major flaw with the campaign that I experienced is that the AI is abhorrently stupidly inept that they have trouble climing stairs, FREAKING STAIRS, to mention nothing of ladders, if you're being claire the AI will stare at you looking dumbfounded as they are repeatedly attacked by whatever is next to them, at least they have regenerating health, that's the only thing that makes them even partially tolerable since they can tank hits and be a nice little target while you pick off the enemy, simply make sure that if you need to switch to moira or natalia that barry/claire are in a completely safe area where they have no chance of being attacked, and forget about taking the AI gun usage skill as its just laughable.  5. The game difficulty is actually very per player basis, if you want a full survival horror game where ammo is extremely limited go for survival mode right off the bat, if you simply want the story but also want survival for the reward, go for casual or normal and gather weapons and ammo to carry over into survival, which I think is pretty nice although a full inventory reset function might be nice for some people to simply have the option.  6. Some say the story is cliche, lackluster, bad, etc. some say it's interesting, again this is personal preferance, although as a heads up there are two endings, (extremely minor spoiler) at the end of claire's episode 3 bossfight there's a small button mashing moment, however if you don't mash the button you can instead switch character to moira and then go, this moment decides the ending of the game (extremely minor spoiler over).  7. Qtes are thankfully mostly gone, there is of course the one here and there when an enemy grabs you and when there's a melee prompt, but you won't have cutscenes full of them like RE6, in fact aside from the one aforementioned (in the spoiler above) moment there aren't any qtes at all.  that's about all I have to say, overall I like the game.

            "review_text": "TL;DR: Hidden Resident Evil Gem, eith episodic gameplay.  Okay so what people may or may not tell you is that, apart from getting these in episodes, there are essentially TWO games.  MAIN GAME:  Traditional Resident Evil humor and writing. Hopefully you played a bit of RE1 because BARRY! You get references all over the place.  Gameplay feel right in between RE4 and RE6. You do a little bit of dodging like in RE6 but instead of THROWING yourself on the GROUND like some sort of action hero, you just do a side hop, good enough to dodge attacks. This is pretty solid since you can move around while aiming. Honestly if they remade RE4 with these mechanics, you wouldn't need another RE game because it would be more perfect than it is.  Also 10/10 to Barry for going to a spooky island and bringing not only a pistol, but a revolver and a rifle.  Gotta manage ammo a bit more than RE4,5 and 6. Feels good.  7.5/10 game, and that is having 5 as a pass.  RAID MODE:  Mercenaries on crack and way more fun IMHO. This is the reason I keep coming back to the game.  You start with a character and a pistol, then you choose the first mission. In missions you will find chests with 'albums' as well as ammo. Missions are pretty straight forward (kill X amount of enemies, go to the end in X amount of time and defend X) and are a blast to play. You get 3 herbs per mission. You level up after missions when you get anough XP. You use the skill points to get per level to upgrade skills which actually change up how you play.  After a mission you can unlock an album or sell it for cash. The album tells you what gun you are unlocking and the skills have their own icon so you know what you are getting. Now this may make you think that you have to pay for gold to unlock items, but believe me, you don't. I am overburdened with gold. You can play daily missions and free missions for gold. you will never need to do this because you will find a few types of weapons and sell the rest (I personally love Shotguns and handguns).  Some characters have some skills unlock early, some characters have more weapon slots to use and less skills. Some specialize in grenades. Claire for intance is an all rounder who like pistols. Barry has more weapon slots to begin with but fewer skills. I got Wesker in the full collection edition and he obviously had ONE-A PUNCH-U SKILL-O  This section is easily a 8/10  All in all fun times that I didn't expect. Seriously after the dissapointment of RE6 this is awesome.",

Because this is a true horror survival - not a action oriented shooter horror like RE 5 - but more true to the originals and as one of few horror games out there that works perfectly in co-op mode (Once you are ingame after the intro, press start on your two gamepads and you are set) ! The split-screen co-op with gamepads is fantastically implemented, the roles for the two players are very different making it more interesting. The pace of the game is perfect. Most importantly though, this game has NONE of those ♥♥♥♥ing ridiculous quick-time events that I hated so much in RE 5 and 6. Good riddance to those.  This is just a really good survival horror game with a good story that goes on with a good pace. It has none of the weaknesses RE 5 and RE 6 had, such as silly dialogs, action sequences and story. Instead it just comes off as well polished.  The only thing I miss a bit from RE 5 is the ability sell items and upgrade your weapons and this feeling of general ammo scarcity. This is perfectly made up by the fact that this game is overall much better than RE 5 and probably more true to the first RE parts. The upgrading in RE:Revelations 2 happens via items you find, and the upgrades can be attached / detached when you find a bench. There are also skills you can unlock globally for certain/all characters, using XP you collect by completing missions.   Imo, this game should have been named RE 6, and RE 6 should be named as some action spin-off of the series. This game is the real dea l and catches the real spirit of the series, forget RE 6.",

Its only $6, like a meal at wendy's or something, so I figured why not. I loaded up the game expecting awful frame rates and expecting to dive into the graphics menus to fix it. Instead I was greeted with gorgeous cutscenes and a FLAWLESSY running RE:R2. Played for almost 2 hours so far, and havent had a single frame dip or freeze.   Gameplay wise, its certainly fun and intriguing so far, but so far im not as hooked as when I played Resident Evil Revelations for the first time (3DS hipster player here), which is easily one of my all time favorite Resident Evil's (didnt play 1,2, or 3 so I cant compare it to those, sorry). It has some very intristing dynamics. You constantly have 2 characters, whether it be Clair and Moira, or Barry and Natalia. You can press tab to swap between the two. Barry and Clair are the offensive ones of the pairs. They do pretty much all the fighting. Whereas Moira and Natalia can find hidden objects, like herbs, ammo, etc and reach or open places Clair and Barry cant. Overall its a pretty cool mechanic that im enjoying so far.  I havent tried raid mode yet but if its anything like the original, it will be fun if your just in the mood to blow apart zombies and mutated humanoids.   Overall, I think capcoms done a great job.

            "review_text": "REV2 IS THE BEST RESIDENT EVIL GAME SINCE RE0 (2002). Yes, it suffers from random frame drops and stutters here and there, but they are slowly being fixed.  Besides that, I have to congratulate CAPCOM this time. (it's the first time I do this). Capcom nailed this one. It seems to combine the best of each past title, especially RE5 and RE1-3. I hated how action-oriented RE5 was. But now they managed to get the best of what RE5 had and blend that into the RE1-3 atmosphere. The graphics can look a little 2009ish, because this game problably had a low budget at its disposal, although that's not a problem for me at all.  The MAP system is great! One of the things I most hated in RE5 was that the scenarios were too straight forward, no multiple doors to choose from. Therefore, the game didn't need a map. In REV2, you can actually get lost if you don't have a map. And fortunately, they kept the REV1 map style, in which you can only see part of the enviroment and are not able to open the whole map. This increases the sense of claustrophobia. Worked very well in Queen Zenobia and is working on this too, especially in the prison. HOWEVER, this game can be pretty straight forward sometimes, just like RE5. Example: Episode 2 of Claire's campaign. You need fuel and a battery to start the helicopter's engine. Instead of forcing you to search every room in order to find those (maybe solve some puzzles to get them, like in RE1-3), the game simply point out where they are in the map for you. This is pretty boring. But let's get back to where I was. Which elements REV2 got from the past titles? See below.   Things they got from RE5:  - Partner moves (Like Claire giving Moira a boost so she can climb a broken ladder; Just like Chris and Sheva used to do - it adds a lot to Co-op) - Collectible gems or precious items. - Breakable boxes. - You can give itens to your partner. - Fast enemies that make you feel desperate. This feeling is increased by the almost-tank control. - Can switch between characters to go through certain parts. - Can use the herb with one button instead of going to inventory. - Story is split up into chapters/episodes (Actually, this is not a good point from my point of view, but I'll let you decide. Personally, I prefer open world style. If you agree with me, then buy RE HD REMASTER here on Steam before buying this one).  Things they got from RE1-3: - Puzzle-like gameplay. Need to restore power of machine - engine is missing - find engine - restore power. - Super limited line of sight increases the horror factor, especially when the enemies are so fast. U feel helpless. It works just like the outdated tank control. - Good scary moments. I almost peed in my pants in the first 30 minutes. - The workbench works in a similar way to the chest in RE 1-3.   REV2 has some unique elements as well, like finding gun parts during campaign (in REV1, you could only do that in Raid Mode) in order to improve your arsenal. These parts are all inside chests with interesting unlocking system. Another thing that I liked is that they not only kept the RAID Mode, but made it better. And let's be real, RAID is much better than Outbreak and Operation Racoon City.",

            "review_text": "REvelations 2 is actually pretty good. It starts off slow, but by Episode 3 the game is really cooking. There's some good boss battles, some fantastic puzzle-solving. There's a lot to this game. It took me around 15 hours to finish, including the two extra missions. This seems like the first time that having two characters together actually makes the game better. One player is the spotter and the other brings the firepower. For Claire and Moira's parts, I spent most of the time as Moira. She can point out hidden items and she's got a flash light that can stun enemies and AI Claire would round house kick them to the floor where I could run in and perform a killing move. It worked really well to attack with Moira's melee weapon because if I started getting into trouble, usually Claire would shoot them up a bunch and stop their attack and I could keep whaling away on enemies with Moira's crow bar. Barry is partnered up with a little girl who can see enemies through walls (and also spot hidden items like Moira) and some enemies only she can see at all. Some of my favorite moments were when she'd point her finger out at these invisible enemies and I'd get behind her to try to line up my shot to where she's pointing. There's also this strange disorienting effect that takes over when those invisible enemies get too close. It was a nice touch. Unfortunately, there isn't a huge variety of enemies and most enemies are not visually interesting at all. Overall they seem very generic. The combat was fun, though. Classic clunky resident evil controls are still here. Along with the campaign and Raidmode, theres a couple of short stand alone chapters to play. One that's essentially a horde mode where Moira and her new friend go hunting for food and monsters. The second one is all stealth where the little girl, Natalia, sneaks by monsters through a series of locations from the campaign. They're both short and are ok. It's always nice to have a little bonus something to play when the main game is over. I've only played a little bit of Raid mode, but its really just Merceneries, which is not a bad thing. The graphics are functional. They look about as good as RE5 did. The voice acting is competent. Revelations 2 is not as good as the recently released RE1 Remaster (99% of games aren't), but it was still a lot of fun. It's an EASY recommendation, especially to RE fans.",

The story isn't the strong point here, as usual, and the appearance of that particular voice actress from SH series doesn't do much to help. Also, these quotes from F.Kafka are WTF material in general, and not really meaningful inspiration. The dialogue is on par with usual RE B-movie horror style, although if you're an English native, Moira's teenage millennial bits will probably make your ears bleed. The environments have a bit of a Silent Hill vibe, which is nice.  The controls (gamepad) are solid, and so is the gameplay. The Story can be challenging, even on Normal difficulty, and you have to conserve resources to survive. I tried the Countdown Mode, and the Invisible Mode as well, but I found it way too punishing. The Raid Mode is really addictive though – more interesting than Mercenaries, with all the leveling and RPG grind mechanics, despite most arenas having been ripped from RE 6. I'm surprised I had this much fun with the RE game, as this hasn't happened for a while.",

            "review_text": "(For a synopsis of my thoughts check overall at the bottom.) This is a decent RE title. Honestly the series lost me at RE5. Unlike most fanboys who claim halfway through 4 was the death of the series (The end of four seemed to be an actions shooter while he first half seemed to be a horror shooter) I actually liked mostly all of them for individual reasons. Six is the only one that was total crap to me. This series has been all over the place really. Even the new one coming out (Resident Evil 7) which is a first person horror thriller.  Story: It was a decent game really. I started out liking the first few episodes. The concept behind it is very interesting. As a minor spoiler alert, I would like to tell you the actual setting of the game. Claire and Miora get kidnapped and taken to a island where they are toyed with by a woman named the overseer. She paces a bracelet on everyone that if they become o frightened a virus activates in them. This is a really cool concept to me. Barry comes to the island to recue Miora after he recieves her radio transmission. He meets Natalia which is his partner for the rest of the game. The story how ever was dissapointing, while the concept was amazing. At times it had me thinking about how it is just another RE action shooter. The story failed to grasp me. The end is what upset me the most because it did not seem possible. It also was clearly setting up a sequel which I have interest in for only one part:  The Gameplay: This is by far the best part of this game. Reminded me a lot of RE 4 which is my favorite game of all time. Great mechanics and shooting. Little things like dodging or turning 180 degrees around on spot are little mechinics that make a whole lot of deference. Miora uses a crowbar because she refuses to use a gun. She is also equipped with a flashlight which I liked a lot. It added more the gameplay as well. Blind an enemy with her then uses partner fighting actions to tkae the infected down without using ammo. She also uses her flashlight to find objects which was tideous and was a hindrance cause it kind of slowed me down. I am all for hunting hidden things in games but this method was annoying to me. Especially since she points out things that physically cannot be in their locations or one would see with the naked eye. Natalie uses her finger to point at objects to my same dissapointment. The shooting is great, most of the infected you interract with have specific ways to kill them. There is a specific bug though that is invisible to Barry and Claire that is really annoying to kill. That was my only gripe. There was a giant guy who threw fire from a barrel which was an interesting idea? But I actul]ally enjoyed my few interractions with him.   Overall: It is worth it for the gameplay and concept. The story is not that interesting at all. I played like an episode a day. It did not keep me to interested but was just a great shooter to pick up and play here and there. There also a few cool mods for this game outside of steam workshop.",

While I did enjoy Rev 1 it had its moments that had me just annoyed and frustrated (on both 3DS and PC) but I LOVED raid mode.  That said...  I have been Loving REV 2.  So far Ive only completed Clairs story and will knock out Barry's soon, but I had to dive into Raid mode and to my surprise I loved it even more.  So Campaign is a kind of shout out to RE roots with a shot and being atmosphirc and scary. Now while the scares are really just jump scares it has a very Evil Within feel to it and Im fine with that. Now as I played threw the story I did get a few of these framerate drops but they were few and far between eachother and by no means made the game unplayable. As for the AI its back with all of its stand in everything stupid glory. I found doing the game on survival Difficulty was borderline impossible due to the AI having their own Health this time around and being very adverse to shooting a freaking gun. That said I dumped down the difficulty and just sat back and steam rolled it to a pleasent start to a decent story looking foward to the rest of the episodes.  Now Raid mode  It is sooooooo much better than Rev 1 first and formost the Maps. They dont just throw you into locals from the single player game no they toss you into locations spanning from from what ive seen so far RE2-6 which I love. The character progression is seperate this time around and the skill tress add for a nice addition to leveling up (btw Hunk SOOOO OP) the fighting is far more fluid and while the aiming took a bit to get used to Im pleasently happy with it as I havnt had any issues with getting Head shots. The Gun customazation has been awesome. Instead of just basic pierce and knock down you can add elementle affinities to your weapons (all the old stuff is still around) which again adds to a deeper custimization than the first.  All in all im 100% happy with my purchase and cant wait for Online to come out in 4 weeks so I can tackle raid mode with my friends. The AI is trash but that has been the case for years now nothing new to the RE series there (ashley was the only 'decent' ai) Also Ill say the facial graphics leave something to be desired as when they talk their mouths just kinda flop all over.   So if you were a fan of REV 1 id recommend this absolutly. If you only enjoyed Raid mode with friends id say wait till all 4 episodes are out up to you but for sure pick this one up.",

            "review_text": "As an old school fan of the Resident Evil series [culling the infected since '96], I have to say that this series has definitely had its ups and downs. I still remember the completely game changing shocker that was Resident Evil 4, shying away from the traditional Survival Horror we were used to. After that, the franchise seemed to have lost its way a little. Resident Evil 5 was atrocious, both in the way of the plot, and in the character development. [Chris became a giant steroid monkey, and Wesker loses it completely and goes over the top, a terrible ending to one of my favourite video game bad guys] Operation Raccoon City was a very enjoyable non-canon romp through Raccoon City during the height of the T-Virus that stood apart from the rest of the franchise. Revelations was an interesting game, and 6 was... okay. It had its moments, but felt like it was trying to be too many things.  Revelations 2 however, hits the nail on the head. On one hand, you've got the ever brave Claire Redfield, sister to franchise protagonist Chris, fighting alongside Moira, daughter to Barry Burton, whom also was in the original game from way back in 1996. The two women have been kidnapped and are being held on an island somewhere near Russia, and are being monitored by someone called the Overseer as they try to find a way of escape. Unfortunately for the ladies, they are part of an experiment on a new virus called T-Phobos; a variant of the Uroborous virus, which is triggered in states of extreme fear. On the other hand, you've got Barry Burton himself, alongside a strange young girl named Natalia, trying to track down Moira and Claire on the island.  Each campaign has a distinct feel to it. Claire and Moira's made me feel constantly under pressure; Why have you been brought here, what the hell are these things trying to kill you, and who the hell is the Overseer and what is her end game? It is a very fast paced campaign, with quick enemies, boss monsters o'plenty and a defined goal: Escape. Barry and Natalia's campaign is more a slower paced, creeptastic crawl through the horror. Shambling zombies [although some who can pick up speed quickly, and some with extremely long reach!], more firepower, monsters that change depending on how you previously defeated them as Claire and Moira [I'm talking about normal enemies, not boss monsters!]  Each campaign has its own sidekick gimmick. Moira has a flashlight which can be used to blind enemies [setting them up for a strong melee knockdown] and can attack foes with her crowbar, whereas Natalia can sense and detect enemies through solid objects, and can throw bricks. [Don't knock the brick throwing, sometimes it's hilarious to hoss a brick at a zombie and watch it crumple] Each of these bring a different style of gameplay. If playing solo, you can jump back and forth between your character and their sidekick. So you can jump to Moira, use her flashlight to stun the quickly advancing Hammer Dude, so Claire can run forward, kick him to the ground, and you can quickly run up as Moira and implant your crowbar directly into his chest, weakening [not killing] him considerably. Whereas Moira can be a hindrance to her foes, with blinding lights and crowbar stuns, Natalia can be a very very helpful little lady! Using her ability to figure out where your foes are positioned can make for some very satisfying stealth clears, where it's possible to clear entire areas without being seen or heard.  I suppose I should try and wrap this up, as I could quite easily write an essay on this game.  As a Resident Evil fan, I think it's a step back in the correct direction for the franchise [although this game does officially tie up the LAST loose thread of the entire Resident Evil story line, so perhaps it could be the last step before the 'reboot' that has been mentioned a few times]  It has a couple of jump scares, likable new characters as well as returning fan favourites who have been out of the lime light for some time. I didn't have any performance issues, and it ran surprisingly well on a set up that is 5-6 years old.  Definitely worth picking up, especially when it's as cheap as it is right now!",

Even with full and easy control of your character, the game STILL manages to be super creepy.   Here are some things you WON'T find in this game: - QTE's - Boulder punching - Spamming a button to pull yourself up a ledge on the final boss fight - Steroids - Huge mobs of zombies - Enemies riding motorcycles and firing guns - Huge ♥♥♥♥ - Boob physics  Is it groundbreaking? No. Is it as bad as everyone says it is? No. I honestly don't see the hate around this game. It's just REV1 with every last drop of CoD siphoned out. I like resident evil for the atmosphere, and the environments. I'm also not a fan of fixed camera angles, so keep that in mind as well. In my opinion, this and RE4 are the two best RE games currently out there (RE Remake would be second best).  Pros: - Amazing atmosphere and visuals - Interesting enemies and bosses - Limited ammo and supplies - Stealth missions - Companions don't get in the way as much as say, Ashley - Companions also aren't completely worthless - Characters aren't roided out or shoving their ♥♥♥♥ and ♥♥♥ down your throat - Characters react realisticly to the situation at hand  - No QTEs (except when a monster grabs you, then you must shake the mouse) - Solid controls - Inventory management and combining - The inventory system is easy to use and navigate - Skill trees for upgrading your characters in the story mode - Creepy as ♥♥♥♥ - It's just really fun - Interesting story and character development - Raid mode is very arcade-y, but is doesn't try to be anything else - Raid mode has a bunch of maps from RE6 - Raid mode has two-player COOP - Offline campaign coop - An absolute ♥♥♥♥-ton of stuff to unlock (figures, concept art, challenge mode things, weapons, etc) - Challenge mode thing for levels (all enemies invisible, time limit, etc) - Decisions in the past affect the future   Cons - No online campaign (but there is an offline coop campaign) - When I first load a level my CPU usage maxes out for a bit, killing the framerate and causing frequent jitters and freezes (doesn't happen to everybody, and goes away after a minute or so) - Companions can sometimes get hung up on enemies, but I have yet to have a companion actually die from an enemy - Mouse input could be smoother - Really bad lip-sync in-game, but not noticable unless you always look at characters' faces when they speak - Lots of hackers in raid-mode (although if playing with friends only, there isn't much of a difference) - You have to unlock things and also buy them with BP (in-game currency), could be frustrating for some - More enemy types would be nice, but there are still way more than REV1.",

The story is good, despite the fact that I don't enjoy this chapter thing, on this game it was interesting, because the end of each chapter made us super curious to see what was going to happen next. Just like in the first game, it brings back two original characters,  Barry  from  Resident Evil 1  and  Claire  from  Resident Evil 2  and  Resident Evil: Code Veronica , it also brought two new characters to assist them,  Moira , Barry's daughter and  Natalia , a young girl who is a survivor of the Terragrigia Panic (an event that happened pior to the events from Resident Evil: Revelations and is shown during that game). The Raid Mode is back and is sure to give several hours of fun.  There are some performance issues on both the normal game and raid mode, things such as FPS drop and stuttering, on both good and bad PCs and with any graphics settings, some people reported issues with data upload on raid mode, but nothing of that happened to me, so I cannot say for sure if it's going on or not. Capcom is slowly fixing them and the game is way better now than it was on release, but it's still far from perfect.   Pros and Cons:    Pros:  • Original characters from first games; • Interesting and fun character mechanics; • Excelent story; • Overall graphics quality is good; • Game can be very hard or very easy to suit your play style; • Good controls (Xbox 360 Controller is highly recommended); • Replay value, you can play the game to unlock things; • Raid mode is awesome, fun and nearly infinte; •  RE.Net  support for online events, items and records tracking.   Cons:  • FPS drops (especially near world light sources or near fog and particles) even on PCs that are very superior to the game recommended specs; • The AI is dumb, you should not wait for them to get away from enemies or they'll make you waste lots of healing items, it's better if you simply switch to them and run away from threats; • The game is divided in chapters (not a big deal now that all of them are already released); • Some unnecessary expensive DLC and in-game transactions for weapons, upgrades and 'continues'.    Conclusion:    I really enjoyed the game, the good parts are worth over the bad parts (mostly the performance issues which as I said, are slowly being fixed).

More characters, more features/content in Raid mode which you will absolutely love if you liked raid mode in RER1.   I mention raid mode first simply because it is the feature of the revelations series that I had the most fun playing in. As for the story, it ties in very well with the RE series in general.  It is worth buying.   ",

Both Claire/Moira and Barry/Natalia stories are captivating as you learn more and more about their relationships. Plenty of twists and turns with the story.  I'd the give story a 9/10.  Raid mode is solid, they fixed a lot of things from Revelations 1. I will admit I feel as though raid mode is lacking an assortment of weaponry. Other than that, it's enjoyable. The one downside is the maps. A good 95% of the maps are either Revelations or RE6. Even the throwback maps are from those two. They are used repetitively, only barely varying. Raid mode is fun, and time consuming if you want to get all the medallions for all of the guantlets.  I'd give raid mode a 7.5/10.",

Yes there are some cliché lines, but there are many I was quoting for weeks after I completed the game. +The story is surprising and interesting that made me think about it for a long time. +Gameplay has been refined with additions like sprint or dodge, and trust me you'll need them. +I was happy that Uroboros is back with some tough monsters like Revenants, Slingers, Durgas and Splashers, and of course Uroboros bosses. +2 endings based on who killed the boss in the end of The Judgement. This choice is genius in my opinion, but others don't really agree with me. +A new virus, the T-Phobos, which brings some new enemies like the Afflicted which is a really fast zombie, the Glasp which is a big invisible fly-like monster which only move is an instant kill move (yes, you should be afraid of them), Orthus the annoying zombie dog with a pig head (don't ask me...Sushestovanie is a strange place) or the Vulcan Blobber who can shoot fire balls (yes he's a ton of fun). +Raid Mode. It's a ton of fun with lots of unlockable original characters, costumes, weapons, gestures etc. +/-Until the end of Contemplation it's like they were doing the grounding and the game only shows what it's really got from the end of Contemplation, but in The Judgment you get a lot of puzzles and most of them are deadly ones (like the Knight Room from RE1) -Optimization. The game may run with huge FPS drops and stuttering on high end machines. The game itself will be completable, but as time goes on you'll become Moira in real life so you will learn to have Weaponized Swearing. -Optimization 2.0. This game has the Capcom cliché named 'audio is out of sync during cutscenes' problem. Most of the time it doesn't have a fix, so you have to watch the cutscenes on YouTube. -The extra episodes suck. They are extremely hard, but not in the fun way, rather in the ♥♥♥♥ing annoying way.    In overall:  I can say that Revelations 2 is worthy for the Resident Evil title. There are so much memorable moments and I can say that I love this game, but the optimization takes away from the good. My best advice is to buy only Penal Colony and if you feel like you could do it for three times more then buy either Complete Season or Box Set (if you really liked Raid Mode then buy the Box Set)      ",

It´s so cool for Cooperative. 1 guy plays as claire and shoting zombies, the second plays as her sister and with her flashlight you can find ammo for claire or open chests. I don´t recommend play it solo, because AI is terrible, usually stuck somewhere, of course you can play for both characters in solo, but sometimes happened i needed open the door, but i couldn´t to do it because my partner was stucked with zombies, so i had to switch and died.... Just want to say, AI is not good here. Just play it with friend. Here you can play finally Story in Coop. In first one revelations you could play only raid mode and it was really boring (Survival with progress)...About Graphic -ye it is good too, i dont complain. It looks good, sometimes i feel like I played Evil Within. But the worst is Optimization... I run it smooth on 60 FPS, but if i go to new room (location) it really hard lag for me (from 60 to 10 FPS) It´s Unplayable sometimes, even i change settings to low it drop FPS below 10 .....

            "review_text": "The main detractor of this game (at least on PC) is the lack of both online and offline co-op. I feel like the game needs at least one of these to truly shine.   That being said, RE: Revelations 2 is an enjoyable experience both in Campaign and Raid mode. It was fun playing as the different characters+also switching between them in order to find items, get attack combos, or for exploration in general. I particularly thought it was ingenious the way the partners complemented each other. Moira can blind enemies for Claire and Natalie can point out enemy weaknesses for Barry to exploit. Switching back and forth to create these effects felt really cool in terms of strategizing and dealing with enemies in the most efficient fashion.   The campaign is indeed very actiony, but I was glad that it included horror elements. Barry's and Natalie's storyline, in particular, had some really intense scary moments that put me on edge. This was compunded by the fact that I was playing in hard mode, which made it very friggin' difficult for me to manage my ammo and health item usage efficiently. It truly did feel like Survival Horror despite the fact that its style is more similar to a third person shooter rather than a classic horror game.   Raid mode is a lot of fun and I haven't grown tired of it yet, nor do I think I will for a while; the level and skill progression system ensures this. There's always something to look forward to after each level up, whether its by using skill points to level up skills or by finding out that you've unlocked a new active or passive skill slot to use. It's also fun to mess around with all the different characters available, given that each has his/her own skillsets and level progression. It's definitely a great mode to have fun with. It really is a shame there is no online co-op, though.  The game does have its downsides, too. Like DLC. It is indeed annoying that there is so much day-one DLC when it feels like there really shouldn't be. Thankfully the DLC doesn't include anything that's truly crucial, most of it is just bonus stuff that just makes the game easier. It does suck that we have to pay for costumes though. I wish they could have just been unlockables like they've been on previous games. Why Capcom? Why?  All in all, though, I was pretty satisfied with the game. Despite its issues I still think it is a worthy addition to the Resident Evil series.",

With the first episode being the only singleplayer part available, its hard to review it, its good, but short, too short for full review, however, the raid mode is where it shines.  It's much like RE:R1's raid mode but with several improvements and ways to handle upgrades, along with keeping different characters different enough to provide a different player experience.

I was very hyped and aniticipated a very well made Co-op game that i could enjoy with others online or offline LAN, but sadly i got neither. The single player consists of a useful character and a walking talking flashlight that will do absolutely nothing to aid in finding items or fending off enemies unless you take the time to switch characters with them, which then leaves your useful character sitting in the corner grabbing their ankles and waiting for any enemy to take their turn. The story itself seems like it would work well, but the graphical optimization of the game makes it absolutely painstaking to follow without wanting to chuck a brick at a characters face. If you like Resident Evil go ahead and save your time, frustration, and money by just going out and downloading a psx emulator to play any of the orginal games. I rate this overall at 2/10 for lack of quality performance, misleading consumers and fans into a game that seems to still be in development since you couldn't even release the online Raid Mode, and lastly for making a little girl with a brick the most useful character in the game.",

This game brings back the spooky and horror atmosphere of the previous games (RE 1- 4), and mixes the control system from RE Revelations 1 to great effect.  During the campaign mode, you have 2 characters to control but at the same time, it provides a completely different gameplay perspective from the Co-op/partner system in RE5 (which kind of removed the sense of the danger from the game). In RE Rev 2, the partner system actually adds a sense of tension and stress to the game.The game cleverly (sometimes not) builds its puzzles around the duo system (think of Sherry and Claire from RE2). Some of the puzzles actually bring back memories of the puzzles from the classic RE (especially RE1).  Moreover, if you like shooting zombies and like grinding for gears, there is Raid Mode. It is like a mini-RPG Shoot-Em-Up game. If you played RE-Revelations 1, you know what to expect here.  My only complaint, if there were any, would be a very minor one. I, at first, kind of did not like what they did with the character 3d faces, but then, you do get used to it after a while.

Up until now i`ve only exerienced them on Raid mode and only for 10 or so seconds on the start. Or in really effect loaded stages like with snowstorm effects and co.  Just pause the game at level start and wait some seconds( 10 sec. should do ). Then continue playing. This should solve the lagging ( it works for me). I am sure CAPCOM will solve this soon enough, be patient.  !!And hell yes this IS a great game!!   For me as an old RE fan with playing every part avaliable i would say this can turn out to be one of the best RE stories we have had so far. Very tense moments at some points.  The game itself presents again as more of a shooter then the old scool survival we know and love.  Not much of puzzles or Item searching. You progress most of the game straightly linear. Engage in fights and action like the known RE4-6 parts. New is that you always have to keep an eye on your AI controlled partner and sometimes you even need him for some of the puzzles. (Reminds me of RE Zero)  Item and resource management is vital so far, even more on the harder dificulties.   Alot of Content has been added. Lots of Weapons and Skills for Raid Mode ( Plays like a shooter with RPG elements)  Ingame there is even more challenges and achievements and this contet is getting bigger with every episode.  So if you can overlook tis 'buh bad' lagging problem that some people experience and makes them stop playing because the game is not perfect from the start... ((( what a shame - seriously people.

I didn't even know of it's existence until I stumbled across it by accident. And now I know why.  It's painfully generic. The shooting mechanics are okay, but aiming feels floaty and inaccurate. Like the previous Revelations, you still don't get a health bar, meaning it's still difficult to accurately gauge how much health you have left. Making the screen pulsing and red doesn't tell you if you can survive one more hit or two more hits. As well, like the previous Revelations, there's still a scanning system. To find the majority of the ammo in an area, you have to stop and painstakingly scan each individual room. It kills the pacing like nothing else.  Also, half of the things in this game are copied from other horror and action titles. If you squint your eyes enough, Barry Burton's campaign looks a hell of a lot like The Last of Us, only even more profoundly ♥♥♥♥. You'll find enemies where you have to shoot limbs off, Dead Space style. Only in Revelations 2, instead of shooting limbs to weaken enemies, you're forced to shoot limbs off to make a random glowing weak spot appear. And you'll groan when you come across Pyramid Head copies.  RE games are hardly known for their original and creative stories. But, Revelations 2 does the 'missing person' plot better than Revelations 1 by leaving the state of the missing party's future ambiguous, instead of showing them being completely fine. However, the story is hamstrung by terrible characters and awful writing. The one-liners are just awful.  To boot, the PC port is very sketchy. Even on the highest settings, the textures are blurry and muddy, and environments are flat and simplistic. The game really does look like a spit polished 3DS port. Even then, that doesn't excuse the framerate problems every time you exit a loading screen, and framerate problems for any map with weather effects.

The extremely well though out environment and new enemies really felt like a lot of work has been put into this game. The two person game mechanics worked really well as you didnt need to constantly switch between characters but instead providing you with incentive by giving perks for doing so.  The serious lack of ammo really made me feel frightened at times and i had to on many occations resort to using the old knife and dodge techinque which actually worked well. The space is smaller and instead of large maps with bland halls, we instead got tight spaces with well though out environments.  I cant wait to start the next chapter and i would say that so far, revelations 2 holds a slight lead on revelations 1.  Overall i would rate the game a solid 8/10 My machine did struggle at times and there were a few instances where it wasn't clear what i was supposed to do next.",

Currently revelations 2 feels like a mix of RE4 and Revelations with a small bit of 5/6. The basic controls are the same as revelations, but there is a true inventory system like the one in RE5.  A feature that I am currently ambivalent towards is the partner swapping feature. While the support character has useful abilities, they cannot use guns and as such their ability to fight is severely limited. Additionally the hidden items in the area can only be seen at all with the support character.   I did have framerate dips here and there, but nothing to bad.  As for the co-op features, I didn't get the game for co-op, but fully understand the issues with no offline co-op on the PC version when it was advertised as having it.   Currently I would recommend it if you are OK with the lack of co-op and enjoyed RE Revelations and RE4.  Edit: As for the day one DLC, it's raid mod characters, costumes, and inventory slots. If you REALLY need those extra inventory slots, then it's a microtransaction. Personally I never even came close to running out of inventory slots in revelations 1, so there might be no issue here.  Edit 2: A couple of new things now that episode 2 is out. It's telling me to purchase the next episode, despite my having bought the complete season. So, that needs to be fixed ASAP or I'll be droping this to not recommended.  Second, having played more raid mode I've noticed a lot more issues with frame rate drops in certain maps. Particuarly defense and timed maps. As for the new features and changes to raid mode, there don't seem to be any real hidden things in the maps (or at least I havn't found them) like the BSAA medallions in revelations 1 raid mode. Additionally there are basically 3-4 ammo boxes in each map, and at most 3 weapon or part boxes.   The combining weapon mods to level them up is a feature I like, since it does make it far easier to get better mods that you want, and I feel that the mods being locked to the weapon they're installed on until you either destroy a part to free a slot or destroy the weapon to free the parts makes it a bit more challenging to decide on a loadout.  The character options also allow for much more customization, similar to the RE6 skill loadouts. Each character has a different set of skills, which are unlocked as that character levels up. You use skill points to upgrade the skills that you want, to match your playstyle. This includes the secondary grenades, which are limited use per mission skills.",

It has many great scares, also the atmosphere is very creepy with chilling soundtracks. Its a Resident Evil that has many puzzles as always, but some that can brutally kill you, and some that will actually make you sit back and think. Its a challenging game if you dont play it on a wussy setting, and the storyline is very confusing and compelling. Notes, letters, diarys, and other clues can be sought out through the whole game to gain understanding of the gruesome story behind the madness they face on the island. Definetly recommend you playing throught RER1 so you can understand the backstory and also see how the game has evolved in the second installment. That game is also amazing and I Replayed the both of them. Revelations 2 will make you fight for your life and learn to be quick. The dodging system is fantastic, best its ever been actually, and walking while aiming is really a convience while these zombies try to be clever and dodge your bullets. Zombies are killer also. They are messed up looking as always, but the way they move is unique and challenging. Weapons can be upgraded, and skills can be learned by earing BP (bonus points) depending on your skill in gameplay. The Bosses and Mini-Bosses all have wonderful introductions and boss battles that are gonna throw you into a cesepool of insanity, shrilling intensity, goreifying madness, tidal wave of zombies, and then eventually the classic 'You are DEAD' title screen. The games so good you cant seem pull away, the monsters gnawing at your corpse spewing your blood everywhere is no discouragment on the screen as you dwell back into the addiciting darkness of Resident Evil... and faithfully try again. This game rocks, check out my screenshots and artwork to get a bitter taste of whats to come. Theres also Add-ons which provide more insight into certain characters in the game. Raid mode is new, fresh, and really fun as you can take on the twisted undead with your friends. A MUST BUY IF YOU LOVE SURVIVAL HORROR ZOMBIE GAMES.",

            "review_text": "Though at the first week of this game's launch, it has many drawbacks, the latest patches solved most of the microstuttering issues I've experienced before. With the new patches, the game runs smoothly at the maximum settings on 1080p with 60 constant FPS. That was great.   The story is good and so far, interesting enough to immerse me with the plot's elements. The mystery, the characters, and the events make the game far more immersive than I have expected. Although, not all games make me feel this way, this game is by far one which made that possible. That was another great factor to recommend this game.  The graphics as well as the gameplay are great. Challenging enough to make me try the game for a few times. The replayability? Oh well, it is well-hyped for me. I think I'll play this game with a partner next time, in splitscreen mode. The enemies, zombies, and other enemy types are also challenging that my character died a few times before I was able to beat them (especially the big zombie who throws fire at Claire and Moira on episode 2). The ammunition, green leaves, red leaves, and other items are scarce that makes this game more difficult to beat even at normal difficulty.  Last but not the least, I'll discuss about the negative side of this game. First is the game support: CAPCOM's support was very unresponsive and awful because they don't try to at least control the situation by just simply communicating with their customers, especially the ones who are still experiencing bugs and issues within the game. How can another customer buy another one of their games if their support staff is as lousy as this? Come on CAPCOM, just give your people some reassurances so that they can also give their faith in your company, especially to your staff. I'm not reviewing for your company though, I'm reviewing for your game but I'll write this to at least put you back to your senses. Lastly, although the graphical and the stuttering issues had been fixed (in most PC depending upon the specifications), the issue about the game crashing whenever I try to access the status screen in the campaign is still unfixed by any patch released by CAPCOM. I was able to fix this by moving the installation directory of the game from my D drive to the original steamapps folder in my C drive, and voila, the bug was gone which means that this can only be fixed through the user's/customer's end and not through CAPCOM support. This solution was suggested by a user at the steam forums. The weird thing though was that when I've tried to play the pirated version of this game and it was installed in my D drive, this issue does not exist at all, only in the original steam version. There might be some errors within the codes of the patch sent by CAPCOM devs as the pirated version I had installed had no patches within it. Well, the problem was solved so this won't be an issue for good.  Final verdict: The story, the graphics, and the gameplay are all astonishing, not to mention the aspect of having the raid mode, it makes the game more enjoyable and more worthwhile to have. Neglecting the poor support from CAPCOM, I'll give this game a grade of 9/10.",

            "review_text": "Overall, from what I can tell from the first episode, the campaign is great. Claire's portion feels a lot like The Evil Within, but a lot more restrained resource-wise. The Survival difficulty is balanced to bring back that old RE feeling of every bullet counting, without being almost unplayable like Revelations 1's Infernal difficulty was. Barry's campaign is similar to the side campaigns in Revelations where you begin with more weaponry and the gameplay is more action-oriented, similar to RE5. His campaign also introduces rudimentary stealth elements, but they seem largely unnecessary even on Survival unless you're like me and just went with it anyways for the sport of it.   The only thing that bothers me is that there isn't any sort of campaign co-op. In RE5 and 6, I felt like the co-op was an unnecessary addition, and I felt that survival horror was best when you're isolated. But in this game, where the side characters are more support characters than actual full roles (Moira and Natalia are only able to attack using melee, with Natalia only being able to use bricks found in the environment and largely relying on Barry), I feel like co-op could add a really interesting dynamic to the game. The game does support couch co-op on the console versions, but this was removed from the PC version. I can understand why Capcom might think that people might not be interested in playing this game in co-op due to the fact that the support characters don't necessarily see much 'action', but I personally would love playing a support roll for someone else. The lack of co-op doesn't ultimately affect whether or not I would recommend the game to someone, though. If you liked Revelations 1, you'll probably like this too.",

I spent £5 because I thought 'hmmm a cheap RE title, I might as well give it a try' - my word of advice - DON'T!  I got 36 minutes of gameplay from the mission which was even drawn out by the fact I had died 4 times (most times due to backing up into spinning blades due to the totally glitched audio which I shall get on to in a second). I've attempted to play the 'RAID mode' and I once beat it within 6 minutes...and then the game crashed trying to save that data. My other 7 or 8 attempts to start this mode has resulted in a crash of the game.  As other people have stated the description of this game is a straight-up lie. There is no offline or online co-op to speak of.  Something which I noticed which nobody else has really seemed to mention in these reviews is how the audio in this game is just downright broken. For anyone that doesn't already know, this game incorporates the usage of 2 characters at all times where they attempt to help eachother out and overcome challenges and 'puzzles'. Every now and then these characters exchange utterances, and if you are unfortunate enough to pan your camera angle a few degrees half-way through their mindless chatter then it will sound as though one character is letting out a slight murmur from several miles away.  Another thing which people fail to point out is how downright atrocious the control settings are. I'm a PC gamer through-and-through and the mouse control is completely unusable because the default sensitivity has you doing 360 degree spins at the slightest movement - and to make matters worse is the total lack of 'mouse sensitivity' setting available. Plugging in a 360 controller remedies this issue somewhat - but even then there is no option available to alter controller sensitivity.  £5 for a quarter of a 'game'. 36 minutes of gameplay, dated visuals, among the worst optimisation I've seen of any PC release ever, lies on the store page, half of the game modes are literally broken, faulty audio and uninspiring control settings.  1/10 Would only recommend as a torture device.",

Campaign is bit short but has lots replay value to keep your character stronger and preparing for next episode.  RAID mode is the one of the reason I decide to purchase episode1. It's fun, well paced and deep. Shame is its offline mode only for now and it gets lots(but unnecessery)DLC trying to dry your wallet. But, still can't wait until it getting online.  As I said, I don't recommand RER2 right now. But it's decent game and I am surly enjoy it. Crapcom, plz fix the game and lei it become a decent RE game.",

            "review_text": "Despite the heavy critisims and questionable buisness practices of Capcom reguarding it's game releases, RE: Revelations 2 is a game I would recommend. I picked it up originally because paying six dollars for the Raid mode and a taste of what this game's story was like seemed like a good deal at the time. I hadn't read the laundry list of problems the game had or the heavy complaining on the steam forums - honestly I rarey look at those first because half the time it's people complaining just to complain with little or no experience with the games they're complaining about.   The Claire/Moira portion of the story was mediocre at best. I got lucky that the worst of my experience was the character model stuttering violently while moving which was funnier than it was game breaking. The story itself didn't grab me and with it often telegraphing jump-scares, like al RE games tend to do, I can't really say there was much keeping me going.  Backing out of it I went to Raid mode where it promptly sucked the rest of my evening from me. Expanding off of Revelation 1's Raid mode, R2's version was a lot of fun and with some classic zombie hunting on the first few episodes it really felt more like what the RE series has failed to capture since RE4 and it's plaga-mutant things where introduced.  After the first patch, I finally went back into the story to try and unlock the rest of the Raid mode characters and reaching the Barry/Natalia portion of the story I found it was a welcome turn around. The game plunged head first into it's more survial horror roots and espeically while roaming the forrest at night R2 began to take on an almost SIlent Hill like approach with it's monsters and atomosphere that actually made me dissapointed when I reached the end of the chapter and was left wanting more.  RE:R2 is a fun game that certaintly has a wealth of problems, but coming from someone who owns multiple copies of all of the RE games (including the original RE: Survivor), it's a welcome edition with some interesting purchasing options. It's also worth noting that by the time I even considered co-op someone had already modded offline co-op into the game again. I didn't come by this game for co-op, so I'm not going to join the refund bandwagon, but it is nice to know that where the developer failed the modding community once more stepped up to the challenge.",

            "review_text": "Hello, First off I have been playing the Resident Evil games for along time and own most of them. So i understand how much the game has evolved over its time. I believe Revelations 1 and now 2 have taken back to where it should be.  Gameplay: If you play Left for Dead or other RE titles, show the game some respect and play on Veteren Difficulty. I did and to me that made the experience. It stressed me out, and i think in a survival horror game thats what it should do. Now in RE 6 they may have taken the mobility a little to high for this style of game, but they made a good middle ground choice with the new dodge system. Gun Custimization is very fun and allows people to play diffrently.  Gamplay= 9/10  Graphics:I enjoy the gritty look, i dont really understand peoples problem with the models they look fine to me. Creatures and explosions and all look very nice. Only issue is some stuttering in certain areas, hopefully this ca be fixed but i got over it. EDIT: they have patched the game a few times since launch and it has helped the stuttering a bit. still happens in some places but its better. Graphics= 8.5/10  Story: Good to me so far, feels more like RE4 and thats a good thing :) Story=8/10  Raid mode: Very fun, I enjoy this over the standard mercs personally. adds some cool RPG kinda elements and stuff Raid= 10/10 would Raid again.....for a very long time.  Controls: work just fine Controls= Work/10  So overall i really enjoyed my experience with the first chapter of RE REV 2. i think fans of the series will enjoy it as long as they dont go straight for the OMAGURD ITS NOT LIKE RE1 attack. People should understand that games evolve over time. Example, Final fantasy. Not all changes are good but i truely believe that this is a very good step back on the trail to a good Zombie Survival Shooter.  Also Hunk and Mr Wesker. thats a plus.  Edit: GET OVER MICRO TRANSACTIONS! no one is forcing you to buy it, its not saying you can only play if you spend more money get the hell over it. If some people want to throw money at a game for extra lifes or whatever let them. i will never do that but it doesnt hurt my feelings.  And they have even gone back to the older style inventory kinda, you have weapon slots and item slots, with the ability to combine items and i really enjoy that it is back.  UPDATE: EP.2   Introduces some new people, ramps up the crafting diversity and lots of crazy hard fights on 'Survival' difficulty  Something interesting ive found out is it helps to use the secondary character to explore. try it. it really adds to the working together feel. Also they have patched the game once so the stuttering issues arent as bad.   AND they have started to implement split screen co-op on the computer. Thank you capcom for fixing your mistake.  update Ep. 3  another good story section. this one has some awsome puzzles. more cool raidmode characters. I am very excited for tne final chapter.  update Ep. 4   this one finishes it off nicely, gives you plenty of good things to look forward to unlocking.",

            "review_text": "So first off, is this a Resident Evil game? Yes. Granted, 1-4 are still better, Revelations 2 is better than RE 5 and 6, and even better than Revelations 1.  The gameplay is a lot better than Revelations 1, which to me felt more like a metroid game than anything else (having to backtrack quite a bit). This game is more linear, in fact there's no back tracking at all. I do seem to be a bit more strapped for ammo, but if you replay a previous episode you'll retain the ammo you obtained....so I kind of cheat sometimes and re-do episode one on casual, since you also get ammo for the guns you have, meaning you can get machine pistol ammo there too.  Anyways, I'm not going to lie, Raid mode is the main thing, for me at least. I've spent like 20 hours or so, only have had it for like 4 days, and 90% of it has been raid, and I haven't even scratched the surface of it. So if you're worried about it not being a big enough game, for it's price, you'll have nothing to worry about.  Now, it's not the most scary game ever, in fact the only time when I've been scared was simply because I didn't have ammo and thought I'd die due to the lack of being able to do ranged attacks. But it's still a pretty decent RE game.  FPS seems to be a problem for a lot of people, but all I'm going to say is that I have an AMD A10-6700 cpu, with a 750ti gpu, and 8g's of DDR3, and the game runs perfectly for me.",

The story starts out strong then just gives you all the answers in episode 3, they could have even put SPOUILER AHEAD warnings. Raid mode was amazing, until I hit lvl 100 and unlocked Code Red or Very Very Hard difficulty which is way too hard to complete on your own and due to the broken multiplayer is just impossible to enjoy.  Then there's the online events, weekly events that you attempt in raid mode. Beat this mission on the lowest possible lvl and you'll get a reward based on your ranking with the rest of the community. Thanks to cheaters gaining any kind of reward from these events is impossible.  All in all, a decent game that has been completely screwed up by horrible decisions, even worse match making and a story that starts strong then jumps off a cliff. I just cannot recommend this, even though before I would have easily given it 7-8 out of 10.",

The story is good, the game looks good too and all in all is a fun time.

            "review_text": "RE:R2 is a slightly better game than the first one and the pacing change of tension/action is much better executed than the prior title which felt like a huge clusterfock with its mess of a story and amount of weak characters. This games progression &amp; atmosphere feel more in the vein of RE4/5 and not the horrible later outings like RE6/Racoon City. However it is obvious the production value &amp; feeling of being part of something bigger isnt there like it is in RE4/5/6, the story is a much more down to earth version with really minimal twists.  The 4 episodic format feels sadly like a poor excuse from Capcom at gathering in money in a different way, its not well balanced at all in its length like the episodes from RE5 or 6 which felt just right for people to end their game session, this game really needed a extra episode or some message popup when arriving at a new long section of the game like for example 'The Sewers' or something. The episodes are way too long on episode 2,3 &amp; 4 especially the ones with Barry/Natalia.  Gameplay alternates between and stealth quite often and actually gives you the feling of conserving ammo unlike RE6 which messed that part up. However the stealth mechanics in this game are rather weak and only really adds to slowing the game down way too much too often along with the re-arrival of one of the worst implementations in the RE Revelations games which is the 'Genesis Scanner' from RE:R1 which had your character scanning walls and floors of cleared areas for items. This time its there in a slighlty lighter form by switching your character but is still a weak and annoying gameplay element due to not only taking away from the pace of the game but also making you feel like you are hoarding because you will use it in a game where you might be afraid the game doesnt give you enough ammo and might have to restart a episode &amp; need the BP points in the game from jewels you find this way to upgrade your character throughout the game. Theres also some lockpicking bits to open up chests for items with Natalie/Moira, this seems plastered on and makes absolutely no sense in its inclusion besides again artificially extend a short game. While kind of fun the first 1-2 time the harder ones later on makes it impossible not to fail as there is no time to change your mind.  The core gameplay revolves around the switching between your 2 characters in each episode. It really screams co-op if you want to go through the game by yourself sadly due to many annoyances. First of all getting caught by enemies usually locks you up often with their moves which really infuriates you towards your AI partner and secondly the controls are just not very intuitive at all, and with 2 characters to manage it really feels like a artificial way of Capcom to implement panic moments and tension by relying on slow &amp; poorly implemented controls. You never really ever throughout the game feel in control of your actions due to this. Im all in for a 2nd partner in the newer RE games as the dialogue between them and their environments add to the atmosphere and story, but the partner controls should have been left to the AI in singleplayer imo &amp; for people playing it in Co Op. This is sadly where i feel the RE: Rev. games fail, the partner controls are more of a pacekiller &amp; an annoyance rather than giving you a feel of exploration and immersion it just grows old very quick looking at a barrel at a corner to see if something will glint that you can pickup all the time.  Overall i can only recommend this game if youre going to play co-op, it is just way too slow alone with the partner mechanic, stick to the main series for the solo experiences imo. The story albeit easy to follow does idd feel like its been done before in the series and doesnt add much new to the series. The production value and variation feels cheap, there really isnt any surprises, its all the same type of areas you are accustomed to in the RE games with sewers,labs &amp; construction areas. The enemy variation is surprisingly low and weak, theres like 5-6 types of common type of enemies throughout the entire game which really makes it feel like this game was quickly done and covered in its episodic format so people wouldnt notice these things. Theres only a few bosses and they require minimal wit and tactic which is really dissapointing as the 3D RE games usually require you to use timing and your environment often against the bosses. In this game they really only require you to move around all the time and shoot them to expose their weak points. The last boss in the game especially is action wise dissapointing, it barely does anything against you and just wanders around the level waiting for you to take it out of its misery.  Overall i think its a decent entry to the series after the abonimation that was RCity &amp; Re6 but it is also a game that indicates clearly that Capcom has lost their way and dont really know how capture the control and feel RE4 &amp; 5 had, it feels like a mishmash between poor stealth elements and bad unintuitive controls to create fear &amp; panic, whereas RE4 &amp; 5 was all about the exploration &amp; immersion of the new environments and encountering new types of enemies along with great cinematics and dialogue. This just feels subpar if you have played either of those and more like its a game thats going through a identity crisis, does it want to be Splinter Cell or Resident Evil ? If you play the extra episode in the game called 'Little Miss' you will come to the conclusion that this will never be Splinter Cell no matter how hard it attempts though, that was laughably bad.  7.0/10",

I never saw RER2 use more than 1Gb of VRAM... not even with ever setting set as high as it could go with the FXAAHQ3; hell, I even enabled 8 CSAA in nVidia's control panel (didn't really need to). My system never used more than 1Gb of VRAM and GPU usage stayed under 40% for each card.  With my beefy system I still encountered massive framerate drops (as low as 20fps) without any corresponding spike in VRAM/GPU usage... no CPU bottleneck either. Lowering the settings does not yield a descernible benefit or increase in fps.  ---  Putting the technical issues aside, I'm enjoying this game immensely. I do miss Claire's original VA and her character model from previous games, but its been about time for Claire to redebut in another installment.  Raid mode is fun (lvl 50 w/Claire). The main story (Episode 1) was good - albeit short; that is ok considering the Episodic release.  Even with the fps dilemma, if you're a fan of RE and have a soft spot in your heart for Claire Redfield, you will enjoy this game (story pending). Once Capcom optimizes/fixes RER2, it'll be a great installment in the series.  ",

The campaign is tedious and the story is nonsensical so far. You are constantly stuck running around with your useless character because only they can see 90% of the loot. The characters are not relatable in any way. As far as I know, this is Moiras first encounter with the abominations of Resident Evil and yet she is not phased at all by any of this. She brushes off any assault and near-death experience with comments the likes of 'Well, that was awkward, kinda. Whatever'. She also swears at anything that ISN'T trying to kill her and she doesn't do guns. Because it's not her thang, bra. I'm sure you will understand. But bludgeoning enemies to death with a crowbar, that's her thing. She is litterally the worst character ever created, in any medium.  Barry is not much better though. I have never seen a battle hardened soldier that is THAT bad at asserting his authority.  'Hey you little girl, you stay by the boat while I check out this creepy looking place.' -  'No. I am coming with you.' - 'Ok *sadface*'  There is no explanation yet for the girl, she is just there and you have to deal with it. Because Claire has a partner, Barry needs one, too. Partner as in, useless meatbag that has special abilities while exploring but is a headache everytime you are thrown into one of those 'survive this horde mode arena while completing objectives'. Because everyone like protecting useless NPC all the time. It's like the best part of all the games that have it, right?  If you want to get into RE, buy the HD Remaster of the first game. If you have that one and want more, buy Revelations 1 or RE4. Then buy all the other Resident Evils first. Then wait for this one to be 75% off. Then it's barely worth it.",

The micro-transactions people are crying about are just skins in the game...WHO CARES. Play the game as intended or buy skins. It's your own decision...quit crying.  3. This game is episodic, QUIT CRYING THAT THEY RELEASED IT AS EPISODIC. YOU KNEW THIS FROM THE START...WHY BUY IT IF YOU WERE GONNA JUST CRY!?!?!?!  4. Lastly, Many of the people crying about frame-rate, etc.. are playing on laptops....GET A BETTER COMPUTER OR PLAY ON LOWER GRAPHICS...  Anyways, as for the game; for a port, it is pretty well done. The graphics are pretty decent (above mediocre) when set to max settings. This can also be improved in your 3D graphics control panel. This game is Episodic in nature, which means, you will play the games chapter and need to wait for the next one to be released. I for one enjoy this style of games. It keeps the suspense and hype going, almost like watching a really good TV show. The gameplay is pretty in depth and has some very fun and unique mechanics. Combat is pretty smooth and fluid. There is a leveling skill system in the game as well which adds a nice touch, especially if you choose to play again in a different way. So far I can highly recommend this game as being fun. Of course, the game is short being an episodic game, however, it is only $25 in total and well worth it.",

Of course, the option to use bullets is there as long as you don\\'t blanket fire, so the other options are pointless.  One thing that did surprise me, however, was the story.

The delay of online gameplay and lack of offline co op is certainly very disappointing, but not reasons to hate on the game.  I'm recommending this game because it is very fun, and the way they finish the episode on a cliffhanger is just tantalizing; this, along with the short wait time of only a week for the next episode, makes the anticipation for the next episode that much better.  Gameplay: I played on a mouse and keyboard, and frankly, had very little to no issues at all. A little tweaking of the sensitivity and mappings and bam, I have the controls to my liking. The features are intuitive and easy to use. If you've played RE6 then you will feel at home. The only real difference is the dodging mechanic, it's not like the dives of RE6, it's more akin to Lara's scramble from Tomb Raider. Personally, I didn't use it much, so I'm not sure how vital of a mechanic it is, but that could just be my play style. The charchater switching mechanic can be a nice touch. I say 'can' be because with Moira, it feels very lazy and quite frankly, uselss. She hates guns, so she only attacks through melee and she uses a flashlight to 'reveal' items so Claire can pick them up. The only time she feels useful is to blind enemies with her flashlight. It's only the first episode so he abilities can be developed later and che can become more useful. Natalia on the other hand, she can sense enemies and some enemie's weak points, so I found myself constantly switching to her when using Barry.  All in all, the gameplay is fun, sprinkled in with just the right amount of action. The Raid/Mercenaries mode is better this time around. There are different types of missions to engage on, so far I've gotten 'clear this area of enemies' and 'defend this object'. I'm sure there's more, but what really surprised me was that some enemies have properties like freezing. For example, there was the blue glowing enemy that when I got too close or meleed it, I slowed me down or froze me. I'm guessing there are more types as I'll keep playing, but that certainly adds a nice twist. You get to customize your character with different guns and abilities, you also get to sell and upgrade your guns. It makes it feel very RPG-ish.  Graphics: Not much to speak of here. It seems they reused the same engine as RE6 and I believe RE5. Althrough the characters themslevs look great, the environmental textuers are pretty average, even less than average since we're moving to a more technologically capable generation. Still, the game looks overall adequate and sometimes decent.  Story: I like that they don't reveal everything at once, or that you can see things coming from a mile away. The cliffhanger at the end of the episode was great and had one, maybe two, twists that I did not see coming. If they keep this up, they have a quality story on their hands, the best probably since Code Veronica.  Bugs: The only bugs I experienced were the FPS dips (no matter whether on my laptop or desktop) and a really bad game freeze on my desktop PC. The game certainly needs optimization, but nothing was game breaking in my expereince.  All in all, this is a step in the right direction. The story is good, pacing is good, gameplay is great. If Capcom can build on this, then I look forward to Revelations 3 or RE7",

Its not back to the oldschool fixed camera, tank controls like in the old days but personally I think this game is better than RE4.  It does go back to its survival horror roots where there are puzzles, neat locations rather than going to another mansion again which im so tired of capcom doing trying so hard to bring back old fans like that.  Revelations did try to go back to its survival horror roots though both of these games make you play as two characters, this sequel improves on almost everything that I hated about Revelations 1.  *Revelations 1 had the constant boring light/wire puzzle which were no brainers to beat.  *Controls in Rev1 were ♥♥♥, like tapping up to perform a dodge on a specific frame of the enemy attack animation and most of the time its luck based which made the game unfairly hard even on the Hell difficulty some parts were a waste of my time because of the bad controls.  *Monsters in Rev1 were very uninteresting, its just aquatic/blob monsters which I had 0 fear about.   *2 characters in Revelations 1 was pointless because your AI partner (though glad they are invincible) didn't have much of an impact in the gameplay nor there was any 2 player coop.  Also you dont really control these guys except in Raid mode.   Revelations 2 in my book has got 3.5 out of 4 of the problems fixed that the first game sucked with... I still don't like having an AI partner with me but on the plus side I can switch between multiple characters who have their own unique moves also they aren't useless like Ashely Graham.  For the old RE fans im sorry but things have changed and we have to adapt to it, capcom won't be going back to fixed camera views for a long time but I can safely say this game is pretty good.  IMO this is better than Resident Evil 4, RE4 is a good game and guilty pleasure to RE5 but those games were too action packed and you are very OP in those games which takes the challenge especially if your doing your first playthrough.",

There are many humorous throwbacks to RE 1 which all fans of RE will LOVE. The character switching system adds alot to the gameplay. It reminded me of RE0, but 100x better of course.

On the harder difficulties there will be points where you have to weigh the value of running over expending ammo and possibly running out when you need it most. You're given a third choice though, through your partner: utilizing their abilities to stun your targets and follow up with a physical attack ala Resident Evil 5 and 6. The story is, to me, well written with strong characters, and it's refreshing to see Barry Burton in a leading role. This game has easily pushed him into one of my favorite characters in the franchise. If you've come for the story, I don't think you'll be disappointed. It feels like a true Resident Evil.",

The story is quite interesting, the atmosphere is defenitely creepy (Though feels like Silent Hill), not to mention some enemies are scary looking. The gameplay is fantastic, you will enjoy going through the story from start to finish, conserving ammo is back for you will reach those moments when you are quite low on it, and melee is quite useless so don't try to rely on that.  Claire's and Moira's campaign was pretty good for the most part, though I was not a big fan of Moira not using a gun, she only uses a crowbar that is useless, therefore shes pretty useless as a teammate and when you play as her aswell. She is only good for locating goodies with her flashlight, and opening barricaded doors.  Oh yea, prepare to hear the word 'F .u. c. k' in every sentence that Moira speaks, this game has ALOT of Swearing from any other Resident Evil game.  Barry is Back!, Barry &amp; Natalias campaign is okay, although not as good as Claires &amp; Moiras but it still held its ground. Barry is now older, and hes character model seems like something you would see from 'The Last of Us'. He still has his magnum and hes a pretty bad ♥♥♥ guy, that being said he comes to the Island to rescue hes daughter Moira and meets Natalia the little girl on the way, and they grow a strong bond.---  --&gt; Natalia is a little girl, so it makes sense she cannot use guns. But she is very helpfull with her ability to detect enemies through walls, I would even say shes more reliable then Moira for Natalia can atleast pick up bricks and throw them from a distance to do some serious damage.  The only con I have is that if you switch from the character with a gun to the non-gun user, the AI that controls the gun weilding Claire or Barry will not use their weapon. There is a trait you can unlock so your AI partner (Claire or Barry) can use their guns on their own, that being said their extremely redudent for they basically refuse to shoot enemies and their slow as hell to do so, not to mention they do little to no damage to enemies.  Overall I really enjoyed Resident Evil Revelations 2, and I would definetely recommend it. Though the story is not as long as previous games (Story is about 10-12 hours), it packs alot of entertainment for new and old RE Players.",

Also worth noting that Raid mode supports online coop.  -Some poor animation quality at times.  -Your partner in single player is pretty much a vegetable, and is quite skilled at taking unecessary damage.  -Contains good/bad endings, the criteria of which is horribly unclear to first time players.  -Showing the price of Episode 1 on the front/sale page instead of the full game.  -Not on 3DS  -No Parker Luciani  All in all, most of this game's problems are minor annoyances that can be overlooked, it's definitly worth your time if you are in to RE games.

On top of this, when you play as Rebecca &amp; Miora duo you can chain melee attacks on some of the tougher enemies to beat them to death, saving ammo &amp; grenades.

Believe it or not, this crew has just the right blend of fun and drama with the dialog, and Capcom isn't afraid to poke fun at its own series, either. Standout voiceover work for Claire Redfield, in particular.  +Enemy design is fresh, but evokes a bit of the past as well. Enemies require a bit of tactics to handle and can vary their strategies, too. First episode could have used a solid boss fight, though.  +Teamwork between characters is real, and actually relevant. Compared to RE:6, this game actually makes having multiple characters relevant and fun.  There's a few problems, too: -Story is pretty vague in this intro. Leaves a lot of questions but not necessarily in a good way . . .  -Weapon feedback (hitting and firing) is a little iffy.

It's not so much scary as gloomy horror,but you may get 1 or 2 unexpected jumpscares.  . Runs perfectly from the moment I installed it. Buttery smooth,perfectly optimised . Varying environments for the most part,although some of it does look extremely similar,and you do partly revisit area's with different charcters . Solid gameplay with an XBox controller,feels less clunky than some of the other RE's . In each episode you have control of 2 character's,each whom have different abilities,actions and access to different area's (makes for some good puzzles). Swapping between each character is smooth,and a really nice addition. I didn't find it detracted from my experience at all,but sometimes the other character wasn't always responsive to certain voice commands,even within a short distance. . Whilst not groundbreaking,most of the graphics are really nice and clean,apart from some textures. They fit in well with the environment and feel of the game,and the character model's and some of the rare,bright coloured lighting look great.  . The storyline,which only makes up a small percentage of the game,was still adequate and the cutscene's were really nice to watch - My only real complaint is sometimes you can go a long time just walking around and collecting ammo,with only a few,repetitive enemies between each point. When you do run into action though,it's intense and gripping  EDIT: Great final bossfight,best I've played in a while.",

Shootan' , grindan' and loot collectan' abounds. Although the variety and number of weapons is disappointing. This is remedied by number of characters and unique skills that you can use in the RAID mode.  Also, Claire is best RE girl, and personally, I think it's pretty neat that she looks her age in this game. We don't get many mature female protagonists, so I can appreciate that.

I got a bit fo a Silent Hill vibe and found myself wondering if this was really happenning or something supernatural or a hallucination. Little touches are great like the facility is old and decrepped, but the difital locks are shiny white and high tech looking. It got me really curious to find out the story of this place. Some of the notes you find are in Russian, were you transported to remote Siberia?  Another great little touch is the second character says she's afraid of guns after 'what happened' and there's a moment when you first ♥♥♥♥ the shotgun and it startles her.
