            "review_text": "Starship Traveller is a must buy for fans of Fighting Fantasy / Choose Your Own Adventure books. Tin Man Games have pulled off another great conversion of a 32 year old book.  The story is based around the captain of a starship (you) who has been thrown into a black hole and ends up in another universe. You'll need to explore the new area, beam down to various planets, interact with different alien races, and try to find clues to help you get back home. At the same time, you'll need to manage your crew, and maybe get into a skirmish or two.  The music and grapics are superb, and fit perfectly with the atmosphere and sci-fi theme. The character creation &amp; combat system are structured differently than The Forest of Doom. You can name your character and crew, and even your ship. All the stats will need to be rolled, unless you want to choose a predetermined crew (if you have no friends). Want to name your ship 'Serenity', and your crew after the characters in Firefly because you're still bitter about the fact they they only got 1 season, and Lizard Lick Towing has somehow got 6? Go for it! The combat system is slightly more complex as you control more than one character on occasion. You choose which crew members you want to beam down to unknown planets. You could choose your Medical Officer and Science Officer, end up in a scrap, and wish you'd taken a Security Guard or two, and end up losing one or more of them. There is also a quick battle option should you wish to use it. The artwork has been completely revamped from the original book as well.  You still get the proper Fighting Fantasy experience. Dice rolling. An Adventure Sheet. Multiple bookmarks (for all you grubby cheaters!).  Starship Traveller also supports Steam Achievements, Trading Cards, and Australian game developers. Good luck to them! Trying to make a game with all those great big, hairy, sweaty, meaty deadly spiders running around can't be easy.",

            "review_text": "This a great adaptation of the Fighting Fantasy Classic. The only flaw that I can find is that there should be an option to play with the original artwork, but the new one is fine. I hope Tin Man keeps the good work, and may we have City of Thieves and Deathtrap Dungeon Soon.",

If you haven't heard of Fighting Fantasy books (as appears to be the case with many of the negative reviews here), it probably won't be as interesting to you because i) you're basically playing a book, and b) nostalgia is the greatest power of all in these here parts ;)",
