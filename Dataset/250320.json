It was like watching a really good movie except you are playing it. The story is so well done that you cannot help but to be engrossed in it. The visuals are amazing if you like a comic books which I do!! Some games have that cheesy voice acting but this game was top notch. It had just the right amount of everything for everybody. Script, score ... the whole shabang! INCREDIBLE!! You will be missing out on one fine game if you have not played it. Wicked!!",

Cons: -Very linear with little variation and replayability.  -Ending,while not bad it leaves you with a cliffhanger. -Bug that makes your choices unusable until you restart the chapter.  Verdict A solid 8 if you haven't played the game yet go ahead and grab it,sale or no sale its worth your time.",

            "review_text": "New York City in the 1980s was a miserable place, and from the first few moments of The Wolf Among Us you can feel it. Even worse than the sticky heat of the city is the plight of the Fables, famous characters that appear in stories like Snow White or The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, exiled from their Homeland and forced to live among human 'mundies'. Placing storybook characters in a modern city is a neat enough premise, but it's the simple and elegant investigative storytelling that makes the five-part series a joy to explore.  It's up to you playing as Bigby Wolf to keep the Fables from being discovered, and to keep them from hurting themselves too much. The former Big Bad Wolf, Sherriff Bigby embodies the noir detective with a dark past and a heart of gold, but his character fortunately never strays too far into hard-boiled cliche. Well, he does drink quite a bit, and smokes cigarettes constantly, true to type but he's got one of the Three Pigs sleeping at his apartment, which isn't. And when the pig calls Bigby out on his lone wolf demeanor, it's extremely apt.  The Wolf Among Us is a highly cinematic point-and-click adventure that consists mostly of interactive cutscenes. When you interrogate people, you have a limited time to choose between 3 dialogue options; if you let the time run out, you stay silent and let the other character continue talking. How you go about examining crime scenes and how you treat other characters effects how the story plays out. If you threaten a character, they will remember it and treat you differently next time they see you. Sort of like a choose-your-own-adventure book.  Even if you use a controller, your interface is a cursor that moves around the screen and lets you interact with people and objects, examine clues, and fight. Like everything else, the combat is cinematic. Tap a certain button or click an object in time and watch the cutscene, or get your face knocked in.   At first glance, the graphics for The Walking Dead and Wolf Among Us are almost identical, but this is actually where the two games start to differentiate themselves. Telltale's The Walking Dead seems to have drawn more inspiration from the show than the comic. The slightly softer shading and muted tones make it the more 'realistic' looking of the two; while The Wolf Among Us has much heavier cel shading and highly saturated colors that make it look like a hand-drawn comic. This isn't to say that the graphics are anything short of amazing- they really capture the gritty comic book atmosphere without being overly cartoony- it looks like a living, breathing comic book. Speaking as someone who normally hates motion comics, Telltale has set a new standard for comic book adaptations.  If you're not a big reader, you won't need you to run out and read every issue of Fables you can get your hands on before playing Wolf Among Us- they make it as user friendly as possible. For the uninitiated, Telltale has included the Book of Fables- every time you come across a new character or concept, an entry is added in the Book of Fables that fills you in on their backstory in the Fables universe. Wolf Among Us has Bill Willingham's seal of approval on it to be part of the Fable's Universe. So if you're already an avid reader, there you go.  For all the Fables fans, there's obviously a lot of familiar territory here. 'Faith' is similar to the very first Fables arc where Bigby Wolf and Snow White solve Rose Red's murder- a great hard-boiled detective story where they piece together clues and interrogate fantastic characters in order to get to the bottom of a grisly mystery. Keep in mind that The Wolf Among Us takes place twenty years before the first Fables story, so all of our key players are a little rough around the edges. Snow White is only Ichabod Crane's assistant, and she isn't sure if she's cut out to be a public servant. Depending on the choices you make as Bigby, you can be gruff-but-well-meaning, or you can smash and intimidate your way through your leads, not caring where the collateral damage leads you.  As I always do with multiple choice games, I had to do two run-throughs where I take opposing paths. Each episode takes about 2-3 hours to run through, but once you take your first bite into the story, you're hooked. Episodes of The Wolf Among Us end with a 'to be continued' trailer just like The Walking Dead, and I can already see how both of my save files are playing out differently- it was like I was watching two completely different trailers. Telltale has perfected their episodic formula.  There's a lot in The Wolf Among Us for Fables fans to get excited about. And if you're new to the series, it's just as good an introduction as reading the first tradeback. I enjoyed the game so much that I did two run-throughs one after another. Either way, play The Wolf Among Us. You won't regret it.",

Not really a big werewolf fan but learning that this game has other magical/fairytale characters, I was hooked right away. The imagery is beautiful and well done. The music is haunting, relaxing, and captivating. This is definitely a game that no one could ever forget or simply put down.",

I don't think it's quite as good as that, but it's still a fun and engrossing story. Filled with great characters and memorable set pieces, I definitely give this a thumbs up.  But it seems there are a million reviews all stating how great the story is an everything, so I'm going to nitpick a few things that will hopefully prove more informative.  I would call this a choose your own adventure game opposed to a point and click game. You basically enjoy the story and make decisions along the way. Each chapter has one or two 'action' set pieces that consist of QTEs that I'm not even sure if you can fail. The decisions are important though. Some are clearly favored to one perspective while others are more ambiguous as to their outcome. Yet others are just 'eff you, I'm the Big Bad Wolf.' Some decisions will lock you out of entire areas to investigate. There is an inventory, yet it's pointless, you never have to combine items or use the right item on the right background object. There really aren't any puzzles to solve. So like I said, it's more a book than a game, even though it's a damn fine one at that.  I also didn't feel like the story lived up to the conclusion of the first episode. The rest of the episodes are good, but they never reach that 'holy s--t!!' moment at the end of the episode one. The season does end with a rather spectacular action sequence, but then the ensuing conversations and final decision kind of drag on, losing that intensity.  But again, just nitpicking. You should definitely check it out for yourself.",

            "review_text": "After finishing The Wolf Among Us i decided that Telltale Games is definitely the King of point and click adventure games.  The Wolf Among Us reveals us the magical world of Fables, a world entirely different of the one we  mundies  think we're living in. A world where pigs can smoke, and the wolf hunts the Huntsman. Based on the Fables comic books, the game depicts a series of crimes committed in Fabletown, which you, as sheriff Bigby aka The Big Bad Wolf must solve. The story is just great, intriguing and with a lot of twists, there is no doubt about it, and the fact that you're to choose what and when happens just makes it greater, even if this does not apply for all choices made during the game. The voice acting is marvelous and the artwork is spectacular. The facial expressions are also much more realistic than in TWD or any other Telltale game so far.  Even in a positive review, I usually try to cover also the negative sides of a game, but this time Telltale guys gave me no chance for it. There is nothing i didn't like, nothing that didn't feel appropriate, not a single aspect i could complain with. The Wolf Among Us turned out to be exactly what i expected it to be - my GOTY of 2014 for point-and-click adventure games.",

I finished the game in about 8.5 hours.  Story 8 of 10 You play as Bigby Woolf aka the big bad wolf and uncover the secret of a series of grisly murders in Fabletown. Fabletown is the hideout of the fairytale characters in the 'real „world .But the real world made some of them turn to shady business or else .You always have to question their motives. And you make decisions and they matter...sort of .Without spoiling too much, but the plot is excellent.  It's an excellent story with really likeable characters, especially Bigby.It has some really hilarious moments, but at other times it's really grim and dark. Overall I would generally recommend this game to all mature gamers, because it contains strong language and blood and gore.  ",

            "review_text": "In The Wolf Among Us you play as Bigby Wolf, a sheriff operating in a world inhabited by characters from fariy tales. Although this may at first sound childish (assuming you’re not a fan of the comics on which it is based), the game is actually very dark and violent as it paints these well-known characters in a very different light.   Best described as an interactive story, you point and click your way through various scenes as you attempt to unfold the mystery at hand. You will often be forced to choose from various dialogue options, allowing you to paint yourself in whatever light you desire and eliciting different reactions from the NPCs.   The storyline is absolutely captivating and really keeps you guessing, its never boring or predictable. Each chapter is fantastic, full of intrigue and mystery, and I had a very difficult time staying patient in between releases.   The final episode is extremely satisfying while also leaving you craving more. I absolutely cannot wait for the next season, will be an instant buy for me.   This is the game that made me fall in love with Telltale's ability to captivate with their wonderful storytelling, and caused me to go from someone who was very skeptical of this genre of game to being a huge fan.",

This game is a hope for me for detectives as a genre in video games will stand on thier own terms on the scene. There is a big audience for gritty noir-like, or neo-noir narrative. A strong player agency illusion is succesfully created. Smart gamifying props 'Mr. John noticed that' after answering his question does a lot. Small elements made this game appropriate for the wide audience.    Plainly digressing - this isn't as big and big buget as L.A. Noire.  It's confusing from the prologue (no context without reading the source material), some answers are decorative. But the whole picture is far too gorgeous to not want a continuation.

This guy had so much depth. He's the sheriff a symbol of good and authority but yet his fable (The Big Bad Wolf) Stands for destruction and devestation. That mix makes the ultimate character.  Unlike the walking dead the characters you meet are in real problems like debt. They have to worry about a shady employer than a zombie. When you interact with them you feel for them, you want them to be happy. In the Walking Dead you know its a ♥♥♥♥ world all around you and you try to make the best out of it but in the wolf among us you really feel they can make it in this world and they deserve a happy life. I can tell you that every character in this game has a purpose and a meaning. Whether you hate em or love em you'll know em.  Choices: The Wolf Among us choices are the best. Even though they may come in a loop and you really can't decide what happens in the situation you. The best part about the choices in this game is tied with your character, Bigby. You can either be the 'Big Bad Wolf' For an evil playthrough and shock terror into your allies and enemies like your fable is. Or you can be the good guy, try to show fabletown that your different and here to help for a good playthrough. I'll tell you first hand when you show your good theres no better feeling.  Side Note to TT: One thing I have a beef with in TT games is romance, call me sappy but they bring it on themselves. In the wolf among us and several other TT games they set you up for love interests, maybe multiples. There is never an option to expand on those feelings for a character. They even blatenly point out that a character likes another or they interact in a certain way indicating that they like eachother but there isn't an option to even give em an affectionate hug or kiss. I think in future TT games there should be more options to have relationships.  Story: This story had me tossing and turning in my sleep. I would only play an episode a night because I didn't want it to be over. Every night after I played the episode and went to bed it would pop up in my dreams. It was THAT good. Your a tough guy but your in a situation where you just might not be able to muscle your way out of a situation and you feel helpless!   In all get this game and you'll love it, if you don't you might just save yourself an itch that can't be scratched cuz once this game is over you'll just be wanting more.",

            "review_text": "This game is supposed to be a prequel to a comic book series called Fables. It is about all sorts of fairy tale characters we know (e.g. Red Riding Hood, Beauty and Beast) who live among us as they were forced to leave their home. In Fabletown (which is part of New York) they try to blend in with the humans (who they call 'mundies') and for those not having human form it proves to be difficult: an enchantment called 'glamour' is a must to change forms, otherwise they are sent to 'The Farm' which is not exactly a place any Fable wants to be.  The game takes place in the '80s and the player assumes the control of the Wolf from Red Riding Hood. Big Wolf - or Bigby - acts as the Sheriff of Fabletown and is set out to solve a crime that ended in the death of one of the Fables. He is aided by Snow White and other fairy tale / folklore characters we may or may not recognise.  Now, if you have already played a Telltale adventure game Wolf Among Us will be familiar to you:  --- there are a relatively few places where objects can be picked up or interacted with (we have the option to investigate our surroundings while the rest of the game gives us a mainly film-like experience with lots of cutscenes and dialogues) --- your inventory does not really get full of items and if an item can be used with another one in the environment the game tells you that  --- there are lots of characters to speak with and during conversations you have a limited time to pick an answer - these affect the relationship you have with these people and a choice can often have dire consequences --- due to the availability of choices a 2nd or even a 3rd walkthrough can easily yield you new results (the changes can even affect the end game) --- during action sequences quick-time-events are common but the pop-up buttons are easy to hit - this is not a difficult game (the main idea here is the immersion)  Wolf Among Us sports an interesting story and it entertains you from start to finish while you try to find the killer of Fabletown. Since prior to this I played the Walking Dead series I can make a comparison between the two: Wolf has more action sequences and while there's drama it certainly is less emotional. Oh, and make no mistake: just because it is about fairy tale characters gore and violence (along with cursing) is common.  For fans of Telltale adventure games this is a recommended title - for newcomers it's also worth checking.",

You progress through the story by investigating areas to find useful information or a way of proceding to the next area. Their is no complex puzzles or anything to get you stuck as the game is heavily story related so it tries to keep you progressing.   Most of the gameplay is about carefully choosing your response to conversations or story event where you must choose between doing X or doing Y. Quicktime events fill in alot of the action parts and add to the intensity.   Graphics  The cell shaded art style fits perfectly into this world they have created. The characters are well drawn and animated, some feel very recognizable. The facial movements and body movements look good, however some people still seem to walk like they have a stick up their butt(This is an issue I have with all TellTale games).   The world they have created sets the perfect setting for how the story takes place. The amount of detail they went into on some of the level design is very well done, even in places you arent around for very long. Its nice to see them still put the detail in to make this feel like a live breathing world.   Audio  The sound is done very well in The Wolf Among Us. The background noise and ambience was well done. The music is superb for the style they are going for in this game. The theme song kinda reminds me of Farcry 3: Blood Dragon music. The ingame music was very good at setting the mood for the events happening as well as for the areas you were exploring.  The voice over work is phenomenal and is what brings this story to life. The voices chosen for each character fit their rolls perfectly. Not once did I hear any voice that I thought to myself 'that doesn't fit'. The emotions are portrayed very well through their voices and sucks the player into the story. Top notch voice acting all around.   Story  The story is where this game really shines. I must admit I was never really interested in this game, nor did I really here to much about it, other than 'Its good'. So I went in knowing nothing about the plot or anything. Wow was I blown away by what I experienced.  It takes place in a place known as 'Fabletown' which is a small community of fables built on the outskirts of a real world city(I believe its New York). This community is build up of Fables who have left 'The woodlands' and have moved into city to live in a real society. However when murders start happening, fabletown turns to terror.   You, Bigby Wolf, AKA the big bad wolf, being the sheriff must hunt down and get to the bottom of whoever is behind it. One way or Another. This is The Wolf Among Us's biggest feature. The choices. Every choice you make in this game effects the story severely, even more than TellTales other games. In the walking dead when you madea choice it always felt like no matter what you did it would still end up being the same result, however the wolf among us does the opposite. Every choice effects how people in fabletown view you, which in turn effects trust, reliability, story arc changes and much more. You begin to really care about the characters. You begin to take more time with decisions, knowing that what you do could make characters love or hate you and this could effect how useful they are to you down the line.   The story progresses very fluently and keeps you wanting to know more. Their are loads of plot twists that will keep your mind bumbling for more answers. Just when you think you got it figured out, *BAM!!* plot twist. my only complaint about the story was that it was rather short, I played through all 5 episodes in less than 8hrs.   Final thoughts  After going into this game knowing nothing about it other than 'its good', I must say I was blown away by the world they created, and The story had me hooked and thinking about it even when I wasnt playing. The way this game makes you care for its characters is incredible and the obsolutely phenomenal voice over work brings them to life with a voice. The animation and level design is gorgeously done in TellTale's signature cell shaded art and everything plays very smooth with a smooth looking framerate, which is I know alot of problem had with the first season of the walking dead.   If you are looking for a game with a unique world and setting, with an amazing story. Then you will love the Wolf Among Us. If you are on the fence about this game, its definetly worth the buy. For a game I wasnt expecting much out of, I must say I think this may be my favourite game created by TellTale(Yes even better than the walking dead).",

Verdict:  A must have for fans of the Fable comics, and surely a great addition to anyone's library. The Wolf Among Us delivers a mature crime drama with supernatural elements, sprinkled with some good old fashioned ultra violence.

That's why we will inform you with those neat 'XYZ will remember that' boxes.   Also we really love to delude you into buying the thought that 'every decision can have enormous consequences', even though in the 9 hours you will play this game, there are only like 3 occasions were this statement would really be the case.   No matter what you do, the plot line will always head in the same direction, at the same speed. There's no branching path or shortcut at all. So even if you connect the clues the game gives you, you may wait a very long time till your ingame character does so. The choices you can make are once again very limited.  So much for rambling about the bad points. Now onto the good stuff, which imho fortunately outweighs everything mentioned previously.  The game is based on the DC Comic Series 'Fables'. Once you are into the game you immediately got that gritty noir vibe going. It's atmospheric, stylish and quite unique in the gaming sector. The cell-shading graphics fit that base very well. From what I can tell the voice acting also is very professional and completely flawless.   Even though the story tends to be stereotypical at times, the characters are believable in their own motivations and actions. There's no black and white run-of-the-mill evil villain to find here. It's almost like the story arc - just like the artstyle, the music and voice acting - is once more another plattform for the twisted and crazy, but often still very likeable characters to shine through.  I played through the complete game in about 9 hours and the standard price would be 22,99€ in Europe (Tier 1). That is a lot of value for your money, considering that this game feels more like watching an entire season of an interactive series then anything else.  Here you go. The 'Call of Duty' of adventure games. Just like Activision took the essence of action games and multiplied it by 10 for the sake of entertainment, while leaving out the more interesting aspects of gameplay, Telltale do the same thing in their own genre. It's extremely dialogue-heavy and entertaining, but if you're looking for interesting gameplay.. go look somewhere else.",

            "review_text": "*Disclaimer* - Very personal review. This game is the most thoughtfully constructed, story driven, out of the box, work of art game that I've ever played. It's beaten the best action story driven games I've played for a couple of reasons. (ex. being Bioshock Infinite, Red Dead Redemption, Final Fantasy Games, ect.) And while I'm an avid multiplayer gamer this one dragged me in to finish my playthrough in just a couple of hours a night to make it like I was watching an addictive television series, and wanting the last episodes cliff hanger ending be redeemed by the next episode as it would do just the same. I was dragged into a world of adult content with twisted fairy tales as the characters from your favorite child hood books and movies were dragged out of their fantasy and into the real world with real world problems. The Story follows the Big Bad Wolf ( or Big-B as he's called in the suburb of exiled fairy tales), and his new role as the sheriff and soon to be detective as the crime stricken suburb is torn to pieces by murders and alliances that'll make you be asking yourself: 'Who did it?' after everysingle turn in the story driven episodic crime drama. A part from the action adventure games I've played significantly more in my time my time as a gamer, this one drags away to a gritty drama that's meant to be portrayed in a cartoon or even an irl drama, but is well executed with the master point and click decision making, left of right, top or bottom, plot this game has, which TellTall Games pulls of better than ever in this original classic. It's mean, raunchy, nefarious, and will have you on the edge of your seat uncovering the evils of your childhood fairy tales one by one. I give it a 9.5/10 to jump on the 'overwhelmingly positive[ness]' bandwagon this game is recieving but always falls short in it's replay value, but who knows? You're different from me. You could play this game seven times through and find every single time to be a new adventure with different answers to the story lines optional paths. Which is great because that's what these games excell at. So if you've watched every epsidoe of Law and Order SVU and have a knack for a fantasy story book story time, you definitely won't be leaving your seat from start to finish.",

Besides that the world of fables within The Wolf Among Us is extremely intriguing and the game as a whole touches on many mature themes and problems with modern society while still being ultimately grounded in a fantasy world and allowing the player to step in the shoes of the big bad wolf.  From my perspective if you want a thrill ride like The Walking Dead you're looking at the wrong game, but if you want a better told more interesting story intended for a more mature individual you should buy The Wolf Among us.

This game plays similarly to the Walking Dead in that it's a point and click game where you have various dialogue choices as well as other choices to make that effect the story of the game. The Wolf Among Us is based on the Fable series of comics. It's set in a part of New York inhabited by the characters from the nursery rhymes and fairytales such as Snow White and Mr.Toad. All these mythical characters had to move to our world after there Homeland was destroyed.  It sounds like it might be a story for children but anything but with the characters inhabiting a gritty dark world where they have to deal with inequality and poverty and the politics that go with it. In the game you play Bigby (The Big Bad Wolf) who is the sheriff of Fabletown. He gets embroiled in a murder case and indoing so finds himself caught up in the politics of Fabletown itself as he tries to solve the crime.   As already said the gameplay is very similar to the Walking Dead as is the comic book style of animation which looks great. The games main strength is it's story which i found enthralling and it really hooked me in. The characters in this game are brilliant as well and you'll meet a lot of memorable characters from the fairytales you would have heard as a child. The great thing is the characters are all very realistic in that they have their own problems like being alcholics or struggling to pay rent and feel a lot more fleshed out than the more 2 dimensional characters they are in the old fairytales.  The Good: -Fantastic story with some really characters -Game looks nice with that comic book style of animation -All episodes are released now so no waiting a month or two for the next episode. -Game has decent replay value as it's worth playing again but making different choices to see how it changes the story.  The Bad: -Not a lot really. I suppose the only one i can think of is that the gameplay is identical to that off the Walking Dead. Wold have been nice to see some new ideas introduced in this area.  Overall I loved this game. More than i enjoyed the Walking Dead. I know this game will mostly appeal to WD fans but this is really great in it's own right and should be a must-buy for anyone looking for a game with a great story. Especially now all the episodes have been released. 10/10",

Although, compared with some of Telltale's other games, this one definitely has a darker backdrop to it. Of course, that's how it has created such a great atmosphere that really makes this mystery shine. You've got this dark, overshadowing vibe that follows you as you play through each scene.  This game is really fighting for the top spot of Telltale's games. If you like playing their games, this one is definitely one to play through. You won't regret it.  See you on the other side.

The characters are all interesting and I wasn't actually aware of their 'backgrounds' until I started playing the game as I'd not done a whole of a previous research into this game.

Where the game is let down are of course the QTEs that also plagued the Walking Dead game, though the action sequences work better in this game, once you remember to always have a hand resting over Q+WASD and another on the mouse. People who do not read the comic may be at an advantage when it comes to enjoying the mystery, not knowing how various characters' futures will work out.

Each episode has lasted roughly 1 &amp; 1/2 to 2 hours so far so in the long run i'm assuming it'll be 8-10 hours of gameplay total for an entire playthrough.

Most of the game is looking for and putting clues together, and most games either make the clues so easy to work with that you feel like a coddled child, or so difficult to work with that you get frustrated and give up and look everything up on a wiki. This game though does the clues PERFECTLY, and you will really feel a sense of accomplishment when you put things together. You will also feel very in control of the story, even when you're not. The choices you get to make as Bigby Wolf really let you define his character. Are you a good man with a terrible past, trying to redeem yourself? Are you simply a law-enforcer, tired of fighting?

            "review_text": "The Wolf Among Us (Episode 1) is the latest game from Telltale Games and the first of a new series. Based on DC Vertigo's 'Fables' comic series, you play the role of Bigby Wolf (formerly the Big Bad Wolf of Little Red Riding Hood fame) and now the sheriff of Fabletown - a hidden world of fable characters in New York City. The last Telltale series I played was 'Sam &amp; Max', so I wasn't expecting the more 'graphic novel' approach to the game. There are sections of the game which play more like traditional point-n-click adventures, but with all the potential hotspots in the area highlighted for you, it's less about hunting for things on screen and more about clicking on everything to unlock more of the story. The story is an extremely violent affair dealing with a murder in Fabletown. This is not a game for kids. The language is bad, lots of cursing, and the violence is pretty violent.   The characters, voice acting and art are all absolutely first rate. The game itself is fun, but pretty easy. Even the action sequences, which involve hitting keys quickly in order to cause actions or avoid harm, are pleasantly forgiving. The game is more about choices than action, however. The game tells you when you've made a choice which will have lasting impact on the game. One downside is that the episode is on the short side. I played it from start to finish, including the tutorial, in under 2 hours. The ending came abruptly and left me sitting at the keyboard wondering what to do next. The game provides some feedback at the end of the episode about how your choices compare to other players of the game (38% of players make the same choice you did, for example). It's an interesting statistic, and from a psychology standpoint, it would be really cool to see more stats and more detail, but I suppose there's a limit to what they can show you without making it boring or spoiling future episodes.   It's a great story so far. I found myself lost in it for the 2 hours it took to complete. If you can pick it up on sale, I recommend that - it makes the shortness more palletable. I know there will be more episodes, but if they are all roughly the same length, we're only talking about 10 hours or so gameplay for the season. That seems low for the full price cost of the game - no matter how good the production values are. I highly recommend The Wolf Among Us, at any price, but with the holiday sale going on, there's no reason not to get it if you can score the discount.",

When this went on sale though I said to myself 'Well, I've heard good things about this game, can't hurt to give it a try.'  I start the game up with moderate expectations. I'm usually skeptic about games even when they are praised by others.  The first thing I'm greeted with is the, to me really nice Main Menu music, it gives a sense of mystery and makes me wanna get into the game. I fiddle with the settings, for some reason it put my resolution at the lowest setting so I had to change that, then I start a new game.  It doesn't take long for me to get connected with the main character, I really like the idea of a villain trying to turn over a new leaf in this new world. After some QTE sequences I get to the end of the prologue for the chapter and the intro starts to play, again I'm amazed by the music.  Based solely on that first little part of the game I knew I was hooked. The story telling is great, the characters are great and the music is amazing.  Now I haven't caught up to the current chapter yet, but I've played the first two so far and to me this game is an easy 10/10.  Scores for those that are into them:  Graphics: 8/10 It's an interesting style but it can look a bit smudgey at times. Music: 10/10 Simply amazing. Voice acting: 10/10 Really good job on this, which is always nice in a game that relies heavily on talking. Story: 10/10 Sooooo captivating and exciting, once I start a chapter it's really hard to stop before the end of it. Gameplay: 9/10 Only thing I ever have issues with is reading all the conversational options in the time I have to choose.  Overall: 10/10! Get this game!

            "review_text": "I enjoyed the game, but mostly from having read the comics. I enjoyed seeing some of the characters I know and love make appearances and getting to know new ones. I loved exploring Fabletown with Bigby and and trying my best to help out the other fables. However... This game is guilty of not really leaving much of an impact once you're done with it. In the end it feels like everything you've done was for nothing and that the developers were very limited to what kind of fable characters they could use in their story and how they could portray them.  ^Saying that based on their villain, which frankly I found very weak and sadly bland. They build him up so much and in the end he's no more interesting than a wet potato.  There was another Villain I liked though, henchman-type, not gonna spoil who it is that you have to battle near the end of the game that quickly became one of my favourite characters in the entire game... She's not the main villain though, it's not a good sign when the main villain's henchmen are more interesting than him/herself.  There's much more to be said about this game, sadly negative, it mostly has to do with the ending. They had such a vast universe to work with great characters, but in the end they just didn't know how to put the pieces together very well and you end up with kind of a mess.  I'm worried about spoiling too much and being too specific, but the ending was the weakest part of the game.  There are a lot of small details in the game I enjoyed and found clever, which was a saving grace for me, but big picture wise this wasn't a very strong Telltale g. game.  Overall I'll say that this game needs a lot of polish and fine adjustments and probably some rewriting at parts, particularily the end.   I will recommend it regardless, I see a lot of potential and mostly enjoyable characters and an exciting world. There's a gem here, but it's not easy to tell from the ending of it. I hope there will be a season two and I hope the writers will have learned from their mistakes by then. ",

The audio is quite good as well; the voice acting is top-notch (the antagonist introduced at the end of Episode 3 is particularly well-done) and the music is nicely atmospheric. As far as gameplay, it's less like playing a game and more like watching a miniseries where you have some degree of control over the action on screen. Really, though, it's the storyline that does it, mixing noir and detective conventions with fairy tales and magic, full of interesting characters and just enough unanswered questions to make me desperately want a sequel.

I dunno but read at your own risk I have no idea what qualifies as one anymore]   With the release of each episode since the first, I was racing to my computer in anticipation to see what would happen to Bigby and the residents of Fabletown! The Wolf Among us is an excellent introduction to new people who have yet to read the comic book series, and I'm glad to have followed this season through till the end.   With the 2-4 choices that are given to you, TWAU gives you room to play it multiple times with different styles (There will only be one true way to how Bigby acts, however); do you play as the strong and silent type, or just be a complete jerk? How about a do-gooder who tries to act for the best of Fabletown? How about something in between, or do you want to play by your own rules? It's really up to you.   The characters have their own dynamic personality, something that I find to be a really hard thing to do in games. Players play to win the game, to further progress so we can see the end; what happens after that. It's up to the developers to make sure we can bond with the characters involved and not just sit there blankfaced to what consequences fall upon the people around the player. Beauty and Beast try to look out for one another, although they don't know that they've sunken themselves in to the point of danger. Snow is bossy and doesn't see her own mistakes until she realizes this due to the people around her. Toad is (rightfully) angry at the system as a whole, and is in an unwinnable situation; a testament that not everything can be won in this game. Even the minor characters like Flycatcher and Hans were impressionable characters. Bloody Mary is a huge dongle though and I really hate her guts holy jesus and joseph and mary (SEE WHAT I DID THERE).   ....This game is great. That's really all I can say about it, really. Telltale has hooked me, they really have. I don't try to find flaws about games unless they're SUPER apparent. It has some, no doubt; no game is perfect. But because of TWAU, I will be scouring to find the comic books and read them.

Though I'm still not a fan of the 'episodic release' model, it's not that much of a bother because people like me will just hold off on playing it until everything is finished. It's nothing different than how I treat other series like TV Shows and Anime; a sentiment that is spawned out of fear for cliffhangers and wanting to see/experience the story to a satisfying end.. in one big sitting.  If you played the Walking Dead or seen how it's played, this game is pretty similar except that it's more cinematic with a bit less adventure elements. That's not to say that it's inferior because if anything, it allows for you to focus and enjoy more of the story instead of breaking it up and have you puzzle around to progress further. Action scenes are composed mostly of Quick Time Events which I'm sure some people frown upon but to be fair, Walking Dead's button prompts and '360 Quickscoping' doesn't really qualify for a better combat/action mechanic. It's the same in the end, because the game(s) follow along a 'hardscripted' line with a bit of room for personal choices which may affect how the story unfolds but doesn't really alter it's course.  So it pretty much comes down to whether you like the story/setting of the game. Wolf Among Us is a mature twist on the fairy tale / fable universe whereas Walking Dead is.. well.. the Walking Dead. Both stories/games are really great but as for personal preference; I like the Wolf Among Us' premise and storyline much more. These games now really have me hyped up for Telltale's upcoming series.. Borderlands and Game of Thrones. If you plan on playing them on day 1 of release / per episode, the price may seem a bit steep initially.. but in their entirety, I'd say they're probably worth it. In any case, WD and Wolf Among Us surely are.",

I say that because they aren't adventure games anymore. Since the last two episodes of the Walking Dead Season 2, there have been no puzzles in the the Telltale Games. You might move around for a while, but overwhelmingly, the Wolf Among Us takes place in dialouge and quick time events. Even in the first 20 minutes of the first episode, you only get control of your character's movement twice and even then only for a few seconds. The characters are locked onto very stiff rails and although there's a lot of pointing and clicking on various options. Even in the very few investigations, the game solves the problems for you. It would be like in LA Noire if you picked up a piece of evidence and immediatley knew how and why it was connected to the case.   Like the Walking Dead Series, no choice you make really matters for more than a few seconds, but the story stands tall and strong on its own, which makes this game well worth playing. The great thing about storys in a fantasy setting is that plotholes are usually patched up by magic and Wolf Among Us makes very good use of its magic, leaving only a few massive potholes right at the finale, which is honestly disappointing.   I also want to say that it sounds like Telltale really wanted John DiMaggio to play Bigby Wolf, as you can sometimes hear the character drop into a Marcus Fenix/Bulletstorm Grayson Hunt type voice. It's actually kind of distracting.   Regardless, the Wolf Among Us is great fun to watch and to play.

Fairytale figures - known as Fables - have left The Homeland to find a new existence on Earth, most of them deciding to settle in New York. You play as Bigby Wolf, a detective who is employed by 'Fabletown's' council. When a Fable ends up being murdered in mysterious circumstances, Sheriff Bigby sets out to investigate the case.  It is a great story, with lots of little twists and some pretty tough choices. If my summary of the story seemed a bit too brief, well, that's intentional, because there is literally no reason to play this game for anything but its story. This is a 'Telltale narrative game' that plays exactly like Telltale's The Walking Dead. The game consists of light exploration, lots of conversations with timed dialogue choices and QTE combat scenes. Personally, I found the combat in this game much more enjoyable than in The Walking Dead because you are playing as a really powerful character who can cause some serious damage. As things get more heated, Bigby becomes more and more wolf-like... and it's great.  The graphics of this game are also phenomenal. The colours are very vibrant and the general aesthetic is just lovely. It is an excellent example of how style alone can make a game visually gorgeous. The atmosphere is pretty much flawless, with a solid synth soundtrack that is never quite in-your-face. I appreciate how subtle the music often is, personally.  There are only two downsides to this game. The first one is... It's a Telltale Tool game. Everything looks great, for certain, but the animations are rather janky. It is not overly jarring, but... You can clearly tell that they are using outdated animation models.   The second downside is not really a downside, but it is certainly something that requires some getting-used to. Bigby is not exactly a nice man-wolf-thing. A seemingly innocuous dialogue choice like 'I'm hunky-dory' will make him aggressively blurt out 'I'm just HUNKY-DORY, THANK you for ASKING!!!'. Now, I am not sure if I am giving Telltale too much credit here, but it seems to me that they have intentionally done this to illustrate how difficult it is for Bigby to keep his bestial nature in check. If my theory is correct, I'll give them loads of credit for that. If it is not, well... Then the dialogue options should have been clearer, if you ask me.  All in all, if you want a great story with a compelling premise and you do not mind a limited amount of actual gameplay, this is definitely the game for you.",

The use of fairy tale characters and myths sets the stage for light familiarity with all of the characters, but turns your expectations for nearly every character on its head. The characters feel less like beasts and princesses and more like people who live in the real-world that is sprikled with principles of a fantasy story, which makes for an incredibly realistic experience of characterization and conversations between characters in an otherwise impossible setting.  This game may certainly not be for everyone, but I would most definitely recommend it to any individual looking for an alternative experience in gaming that is combined with the quality of a cable television series. I'm excited to play through the game a second time to discover what will occur differently upon making different decisions.

            "review_text": "I wasn't sure about the Fables setting when I went into this game, but I'm glad I played it.   Another one of Telltale's delightful graphic novels. I say that because they aren't adventure games anymore. Since the last two episodes of the Walking Dead Season 2, there have been no puzzles in the the Telltale Games. You might move around for a while, but overwhelmingly, the Wolf Among Us takes place in dialouge and quick time events. Even in the first 20 minutes of the first episode, you only get control of your character's movement twice and even then only for a few seconds. The characters are locked onto very stiff rails and although there's a lot of pointing and clicking on various options. Even in the very few investigations, the game solves the problems for you. It would be like in LA Noire if you picked up a piece of evidence and immediatley knew how and why it was connected to the case.   Like the Walking Dead Series, no choice you make really matters for more than a few seconds, but the story stands tall and strong on its own, which makes this game well worth playing. The great thing about storys in a fantasy setting is that plotholes are usually patched up by magic and Wolf Among Us makes very good use of its magic, leaving only a few massive potholes right at the finale, which is honestly disappointing.   I also want to say that it sounds like Telltale really wanted John DiMaggio to play Bigby Wolf, as you can sometimes hear the character drop into a Marcus Fenix/Bulletstorm Grayson Hunt type voice. It's actually kind of distracting.   Regardless, the Wolf Among Us is great fun to watch and to play. Its story kept me emotionally invested and its characters kept me interested in every moment inbetween.",

However, such notions proved unfounded shortly into the first episode. The Wolf Among Us is a prequel to the Fables comic book series which I've never read; you truly don't need to in order to enjoy this game. The Wolf Among us portrays various fairy tale characters tied together such as The Big Bad 'Bigby' Wolf, Snow White, Beauty and the Beast, and one of the Three Little Pigs in 'our' world; in a noir-esque downtrodden section of the Bronx. This game may ruin your childhood; in the world of Fables, ever present is prostitution, murder, and drugs amongst other crimes.  (If you've ever wanted to see the Little Mermaid pole dance topless, then this may be the game for you, you degenerate perv.)  You play as Bigby, the sheriff of Fabletown who must solve a string of murders which is something of a very rare occurrence. As to not give anything away, I will not say anymore. The only downside that I can possibly think of, albeit small, is the somewhat abrupt cliffhanger of an ending which there are various theories floating around as to what it could mean. However, there is supposed to be a season 2 to The Wolf Among us. Regardless, if you liked The Walking Dead game(s), what Nolan did for Batman in terms of realism, and/or you’re simply a kinky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who wants to see fairy tale characters degrade themselves, buy this game.",

            "review_text": "It's a Telltale game. Need I say more? Well, I think yes.  I too am one who now avoids these games because of their apparnt stagnant and stale nature, with old engines in use, dodgy animation and similar 'comic-book' art-style throughout all their games. Fortunately this copy was a gift to me. Having played the Walking Dead Series 1 and 2, I've grown tired of the formula as have many others. The occasional walking and interacting with obvious things, little in the way of creativity and/or puzzle solving, and certainly no choices that 'actually' mean anything. But, while Walking Dead has follow up series to think about, and so has to limit branches, Wolf Among Us does not and I feel this is much to the game's advantage for it feels like your choices actually do impact the 'overall picture' at the end of the game. By that I mean which characters are still around, and what they think of you. Obviously the story will play out the same regardless, it just may be with different friends or companions. But there is replay value there at least.  So, for those unfamiliar with the formula - it's an episodic series where you play as the Wolf in a community of Fables (characters from Fable tales put into human disguises in order to mingle with society. But something goes wrong in this fragile community, and being the 'Sheriff' it's up to you to investigate what is going on. There are a few twists and turns which are exiciting along the way.  Most of the game will involve one of the following: 1) Quick Time Events 2) Talking to people to trigger the next thing 3) Examining things to trigger people to talk to and/or the next thing. The controls are ok, character movment feels as sluggish as in the other games, but at least environments are not too big so exploring doesn't take an unecesary amount of time. So through the game you will be doing one of the above with a fair bit of moving from one person or obviously interactible object to another, and that's ok, a bit dull, but ok. Becuase in my opinon the story and atmosphere makes up for it - the voice acting really shines there too (though facial animation can be a bit trippy to me).  As with a lot of 'Who-Dunnits', and as already mentioned, there are a good number of twists and turns in this game, friendships are doubted, corruptions revealed, vigilantes unmasked and more, all along the way, because you are sherrif you effective choose how you want to run the community. Do you play Good-Cop and everyone is happy with you, but may continue to hide things, or do you play Bad Cop, knocking the truth out of people and making them resent you? There is a very strong theme of Justice throughout the series and it works pretty well, motivating many player actions and plot points which do not seem forced, but make sense.  I did encounter a few bugs here and there, nothing particularly bad, only requiring a couple of restarts on one occasion.  As a standalone series I do recommend it, especially if you enjoy crime shows on TV as it plays out very much like one of those, except you build your character as you go, rather than watching pre-established characters and relationships play out. Just be aware that at least half of the gameplay is a bit dull, uninspired and repetitive and will sometimes find yourself just wanting to get to the next bit of the story.",

Even the worst actors were better than the best actors I have heard in some big budget games. More of a statement about the quality of VAs in games I suppose, but these VAs definitely have chops. even the kid is really good.   A well-constructed narrative, particularly for this type of 'moral choice' game. Generally you get the obvious good and bad options, but this game has a bit more variance thnaks to the characters, and the option to remain silent. You will definitely be going to and from who you think is responsible for what happens. Seems short because it is only 5 episodes but each episode is a few hours. Though if you go into it with a poopsock mindset you are wasting your time and the games time, immerse yourself in it.   If you can't help but just rush through it catatonically, it's your own loss, but it is an easy game for achievements, as they unlock as you play through the story. I do seem to have missed one or two, probably based on choices I have made, but really easy to fix if I have the time. If all you care about is your steam score, whatever it's called, this is a good game for you.   Good mix of humor and grit, the tone seems kind of light to being with, but the more you play the more twisted it gets, and the more you question your morality, and past decisions. Liberal use of language helps to make the tone feel more adult, and the characters more real. The darkness isn't over the top and try hard, just kind of sprinkled around, for instance if you look carefully in the background of the office there appears to be a man hanging. Also if you are mean to the toad kid you have issues.  CON   The cell-shaded graphics weren't breathtaking, but still a bit refreshing. For how recent the game was I was a bit surprised by the quality, compared to some other recent cell-shaded games, but I suppose it is a compromise for all of the other effort that has gone into it.   A few glitches. Some of them could have potentially made a mess like conversation options saying 'this option is blank' but elliciting responses. I thought it was some kind of trippy dream sequence but glad I reloaded the game just in case. Also got one time when I walked into a corner and then couldn't escape it not matter what I tried. Nothing loading from the last checkpoint can't fix in my experience.  Combat is QTE-based, so don't expect a challenge, but how you fight makes a difference, I will leave it at that.   The preview at the end of each episode could probably be done without, surprises are a strength in the game so taking that away isn't ideal, though understandable with the episode release format, you want to give customers a hook. The 'previously on' would be nice to be able to skip too.   FINAL WORD   Initially I really didn't want to play this game at all, it just seemed linear, short, and childish by how I had seen it advertised. It was only thanks to seeing a friend play it that it caught my interest, with a toad telling you to '♥♥♥♥ off'. I got it on sale warily, but now I have experienced it I would say it was probably worth the price. Defintely going to check out other Telltale games, now that my prejudice has been dispelled.",

Each character that gets introduced has already lived their fairytale life and is living in the modern day city. The characters that are in the game really do give this story a backbone. As with most Tell Tale games, I do enjoy the choices you are given that affect your ending of the game. It almost reminds me of that book series 'Choose Your Own Adventure' by Edward Packard.  Back to the game, the story gets deep and is almost like a murder mystery you have to solve.

This game follows Bigby Wolf, a Sherrif in Fabletown. Since this is an episodic adventure, I must state how the episodes are split at key points and cliffhangers. Here are Pros and Cons for each episode.  Episode 1: 10/10 Pros One of the best ways to start off a game ever. Difficult choices effecting the whole game within the first hour. Character devolpment is paced finely. Major plot decission around the end Cons Investigation is the only investigation in the game. Terrible glitch that occurs frequently to hinder immersion, a glitch removing the first cutscene and adding blank choices.  Episode 2: 7/10 Pros Interigation has Good cop Bad cop route, suited for your choice. Continuation of the story speeds up in this part, as opposed from the slow pacing of last part. Shocking revelation at the end is the only major plot point Cons Continuaty from the 'Next Episode' clips is incorrect. Anti-climactic story arc contiuation from the last episode. -1. Terrible glitch that occurs frequently to hinder immersion, a glitch removing the first cutscene and adding blank choices.   Episode 3: 9/10 Pick from 3 Places to visit in order to find the 'Killer'. Plot point that will have effect on. Werewolf Bigby. Introduction of my favorite villian of all time. Choice between Sparing a life and ending a life. Cons: Terrible glitch that occurs frequently to hinder immersion, a glitch removing the first cutscene and adding blank choices. Hillarious glitch that makes Bigby Pole dance. Top lel. None other to think about.  Episode 4: 8/10 Pros Spend the entire episode on hunt for a certain shard of a certain object. Trying to track down the killer. Nice story Cons Terrible glitch that occurs frequently to hinder immersion, a glitch removing the first cutscene and adding blank choices. Although nice story, Straight forward and Bland. Still manages to screw up continuity. -1.  Episode 5: 9.5/10 Pros  Best gameplay from this series. Tear Jerking Ending. Major ending revalation. The choice is yours to kill the killer, or not, at any given point. Best supporting character ever has huge plot twist. Can't wait for season 2. Cons No matter what choice you make, the Citizens of Fabletown are upset. (Blank Box bug fixed)  OVERALL: 95/100 Great Game. Gripping. Tear Jerking. ACTUALLY GOOD Quick Time Events. Branching Dialouge surpassing The Walking Dead series. Most Bugs worked out.",

            "review_text": "  Rating:  ★★★★☆   Who Should Buy this Game? : Wolf Among Us is a very unique game; it gory, dark and contains nudity - so it may not a game for all audiences. It is also not your typical point and click adventure that many people may associate to such style games. Wolf Among Us should be taken to heart as an interactive story with forgiving quick time events. So if you are expecting the depth of something like,  The Secret of Monkey Island, Blade Runner, Myst etc.  you may be in for a let down. Or if you are some one looking for a puzzle adventure style game similar to Sam and Max or Myst - this game is not for you. But if you just want a great story to just sit down, watch and be a part of you are in for one heck of a ride.   Synopsis:  Wolf Among Us is based on the comic book series Fables written by Bill Willingham. Without having to ruin the story - which is covered beautifully throughout the game and through the extra 'Fable Book Content'accessed through the main menu - it is essentially a murder mystery. Something foul is happening in Fable town and you as the town sherrif has to find out who really is behind the killings and decide how you want to dispense justice. Will you kill anyone who gets in your way? Or try to break the sterotype of being the Big Bad Wolf? The choices you make will shape the communities opinion toward you.    Game play wise  - the game in heart is an interactive story, with very forgiving quick time events. Infact there was a point in time where almost the entire combat I didn't press a single key just to see what happens. With the exception of the last obivious fatality which would have happened if I didn't react - it had no lasting impression on the game by missing a few quick time events. In other words it is very forgiving if you make a few mistakes along the way. This game shouldn't be played thinking there is only 1 right answer. Every answer is the right answer, as you are the one who shapes the story to decide the ultimate outcome and the fate of Fable. If you keep 'replaying' elements - you will probably ruin the experience. Choose what you believe is the best option and force your self to stick with it, to see how your choices finally sets the end tone of the game. Then replay the game with different choices, and see how things turn out. The entire game will last about 4 - 5 hours for a single play through, with each episode lasting for around 45 minutes. If you know what to expect, you will deffinetly enjoy the story and writing which is superb.   Cons:   I did experience maybe 2 crashes throughout the entire game, which resulted in me having to restart 1 chapter. Also in one of the episodes the animation and voice acting is a bit wonky as either one of the voice actors changed inbetween - or her lines were cut up so she sounds if her voice was done by a translation synthesizer. Though she is only a side character who only has about 5 minutes of screen time through the entire game at most, so it isn't a major issue - just annoying. There are also a lot of loose ends by the end of the game, but as I understand it - a season 2 should be coming out. Even then the major arc does get answered, but all your decisions will not have an impact in this season as some will be carried on to season 2.     Summary:  If you want a great story and looking for a casual cheap game, this game is worth every penny even at full price. It has great replability. solid story and a unique art style. But if you are some one who is more interested in puzzles and more elements of an interactive nature, this game may not be a good option for you. Either way if your on the fence, you should deffinetly give it a shot.  See yall around. -Swat",

They all have varied choices. + The stats at the end of each chapter with the % of people that took that choice was neat. + Nudity, it may turn people off on the game, but it was story based.   Cons:  - Short, beat the game in 10 hours (wish it was longer, but not really a con) - Bug in Chapter 5 that scared me that I might have to restart the chapter, had to close game and re open and start from checkpoint. - Not a con for me, but theres more dialog choices than action scenes with button combinations.  Overall fun game, and worth the play. I would recommend this to anyone who asked me if the game was worth buying. Probably the best game in the genre.  10/10  I wish I could erase my memories and play this masterpiece over and over.",

And I think it's the best adventure game you can get for this kind of money these days. And that comes from a guy that hasn't played any adv games since Space Quest and Neverhood.

I have yet to play the other episodes, but i'm confident that it will only get better.  I won't go into spoilers, but the story and voice acting is really good, which is what Telltale Games does best. Since it's a point and click game, so the gameplay is quite simplistic but it has been improved since The Walking Dead. The action fights and QTE's are much more improved and the art style has been improved as well.

But the best part of the game is the way that every choice matters, and shapes the story. More games should be like this. My only qualm with the game is the quicktime-event combat. True, the cinematic nature of the combat is cool, but it's hard to pay attention to it when you're constantly looking for the next hotspot you'll have to click or key you'll have to punch.

The mechanics of the game are superfluous - almost to the point of being insulting.  But the story and art are wonderful. The game has a lot of atmosphere and character. The people you meet and interact with are interesting and their stories are complex. Just be aware that most decisions are 'damned if you do, damned if you don't'. Once you realize this, you can just kick back and pick random choices, eat popcorn, and watch it unfold like a movie, and don't worry that you didn't pick the right choice - there never was one.

But I did enjoy the gritty take on the fairy tale characters we all know, and maybe a few we don't, which most have no real resemblance to the originals at all and makes for an interesting hook. It certainly has me wanting to play the rest of the series to see what other fables will get the 'pulp fiction' treatment. Never read the Fables comics this game is based on, so I am unfamiliar with this particular universe as many who play may already be. It certainly isn't necessary to enjoy the game though.

Sure it is in ways a visual novel and your only involvement in the story are QTE's, but they are done so well and the story carries such a pace most players wont mind it. The graphics are a bit sharper than the walking dead and it seems as though the texture quality has improved as well. They added pop-ups to the top of the screen indicating how the characters reacted to your choices and that they will remember it in the future so you know exactly where your decisions are coming into play. As far as the story goes the writers have done a unique take on tales we all know and love from when we were kids, you play as Bigby (Big B, Big Bad Wolf) who is a cop in a town full of 'fables' characters from well...fables. Only in his town things get a little mature, don't be surprised to see lots of blood, violence, swearing, alcohol and nudity. Bigby is attempting to solve a crime when he is seemingly dragged into the criminal underworld and left to fend for himself. There may not be an emotional attachment like Clementine (Walking Dead) right off, but the story is good enough that it keeps you interestead through the first episode and definitely left me wanting more. Worth every penny of the $25 price tag.   TL:DR Buy the game.",

Thats usually how I like my games, a fresh point of view.  Game is very solid, nice story line and like most telltale games you have a nice impact on the story. It came off more as if I changed the story and lets say The Walking Dead series.  Combat was alright, although its filled with quicktime events. I rarely like this, but in these types of games its more like watching a movie where you press buttons occasionally.   The game was not perfect by any means, since I did encounter a couple of bugs. Sometimes they were funny though.  For example at the end of the game when I was going to see Snow, I was just a pair of floating teeth. Or another time, all the speech options were filled with 'This option is blank', when I pressed the button anyways I teleported around in the story sometimes going forward sometimes backwards. Got me ♥♥♥♥ing confused.  Easy fix though, just reboot the game and start from latest checkpoint.  The only real problem I had with the game was the intro scene every time I finished an episode. Its not a big problem or anything, but it was kinda annoying having to watch Bigby's silhouette walk for 2 minutes every time I felt like playing multiple episodes.   It was a really nice story though, you can be a real sack of ♥♥♥♥ at times, just the way I like it.  7/10 - Would play again in a year or two. Maybe as a nice guy that time.",

            "review_text": "Telltale games, a relatively unknown game studio for most of its life, has recently hit it big since releasing its Walking Dead titled adventure game released last year. A studio previously known for comedic-styled adventure games, the Walking Dead was a huge change of direction for the studio. It incorporated a gritty comic book style art style, with mature themes and the possibility for you the player to make the choices. Telltale continues along this path with their newest game: The Wolf Among Us.  Set in the same world as the comic book series “Fables”, The Wolf Among Us brings us the story of Bigby, AKA, the big bad wolf. Him, along with most of our other beloved story book characters, have been forced out of their homelands and have had to relocate to New York City and live their lives secretly under the guise of regular people. Don’t let the storybook references fool you however, as this is not a game for children. The Wolf Among Us tackles some mature subject matter, specifically a murder case, and includes some graphic scenes and crude language among other things.  The Wolf Among Us draws from its source material well, as it delivers an extremely intriguing story full of interesting characters and innovate locales. You are constantly on your toes as the action pulls you to various crime scenes and other locations. Bigby is a likeable main character, gruff and straight to the point, but vulnerable in ways that only you the character really understand.  As an adventure game, it follows the classic point and click formula; talking to people, collecting items, and exploring the environment as your main tasks. While some people will dislike the lack of action in the game, it really gives you a more emotional attachment to the story and characters, which makes the moments of action (through quick time events) that much more dramatic. Being able to make decisions and choose conversation responses as Bigby really drew me into the game, giving me a sense of purpose and feeling like my decisions really mattered. The game specifically presents two large choices that you will have to pick from, and whichever you pick can drastically alter your game experience.  Like most other Telltale games before it, The Wolf Among Us is being released in an episodic format akin to a television show. Meaning after finishing the roughly two hour long episode you will be aggravated to find you have to wait for the next. The cliffhanger ending definitely added suspense and I found myself eagerly awaiting the next episode.  The Wolf Among Us is a brilliant adventure game, and one of Telltales best. Its great story, interesting art style, and memorable characters leave me eagerly awaiting the release of the next episode.",

I thoroughly enjoy the element of suspense created by not knowing which characters are going to make it.  I wish they would release episodes faster, but that is also part of what makes Telltale games so great; you can really tell that they are taking the information gathered from players experiences to help craft the experience the best way possible.  A lot of people do not like QTEs. however, the ones you will encounter are very well done and will have you excited rather than annoyed and frustrated.

I already knew it wouldn't have traditional mechanics and that's fine, I liked it the way it is; but after finishing the first episode and playing it a second time, just to see how choices I made mattered, it left me quite disappointed. Every dialogue ends the same no matter what I do, and the highlighted choices of the player only change few minor sequences during scenes; I didn't bought it for QTE, you know. I would understand if the linearity of Episode One was due to setting and character introductions, but I hope the future releases will make me feel more like I'm affecting the storyline, because this game deserves to be perfect.  Nonetheless, I really enjoyed this game and I'm looking forward to play the rest of it. My complaint does not change the fact it's a good work, I just think it can be bettered.

The lack of zombies makes it less... gory and gross and more just socially engaging. Whenever The Walking Dead made me open a door, I remember thinking 'What will jump me from behind there?'. Here, it's a little more subtle, more like 'Now what will these people want me to do?'.  You will have to make moral decisions and these will have an impact on how people behave around you. No, it will not alter the story completely in a huge way, certain milestones have to be touched.  What makes the story great is how they implemented the fairytale creatures, how everyone ended up. To me, not having read the comics, that was interesting to see. The whole issue of blending in with the humans and the kind of society this creates is awesome. (Seriously, Sheriff Bigby Wolf... how cool is that?) That, added to the decision-making of the Telltale Engine, makes for one of the best games ever made.",

For those who aren't aware, it revolves around a bunch of different fairy-tale characters called Fables, such as Snow White, Ichabod Crane, The Little Mermaid, and most importantly, the Big Bad Wolf. The game is tailored by the choices you make, and your decisions can lead to good or bad things later down the road, as I'm sure most of you who have played Telltale games before already know.   The reason I loved this game so much is because it takes a bunch of fairy-tale characters that you already know and puts them all together in this dark, grimy story, and it's really interesting to see it all. That's also the reason I enjoyed this more than The Walking Dead; the setting was just overall more appealing to me, and I really liked The Walking Dead, so if you're like me, you will love this game.  Overall, the story is excellent and the only real complaint I have is one I have also had with The Walking Dead, and that is the fact that some of the dialogue choices aren't clear whether they are going to be nice or mean, and you might end up picking something thinking it's going to be one thing and really it's the other. The dialogue can also be iffy at times, but it doesn't take away from the story whatsoever, just a small annoyance. I really love this game, and I recommend it to anyone who appreciates Telltale games and dark, fairy-tale stories.  ",

The story line and feel to the game is very much in keeping with the series, but you don't need any knowledge of this to enjoy the game. Back story is provided as you play through.  The game itself is superbly made, boasting great voice-acting, artwork work, music (a great 80's throwback soundtrack) and storyline that combine to make the game really engaging. The game combines conversation trees with more action-orientated scenes (where you have to make real time decisions and interact with the characters more) to guide players through a world where you do feel like the choices you make influence the outcome and storyline. I'm a relatively casual gamer, and I hardly ever replay games, but with TWAU, I've found myself replaying episodes to a) see what other storylines I can uncover and b) to simply play more of the game. Telltale has also built in a statistics tracker, so that at the end of epsiodes, it compares your choices on major deicisons to that of other players. Quite neat relly.   If you are looking for a fast paced game, then this isn't for you. The game has it's moments of drama, but the draw of the game is the storyline and characters, rather than the actual gameplay. It's like watching a beautifully drawing animated movie, where you have to power to influence how it ends.",

A lesser complaint is the proper thing to do is a bit obscure at times, but not so often or extremely as it takes away from the overall game. Plus in trying to figure what random bit to look at gave me lots of other fun tid-bits. Lastly the thing i found strangely funny about the game is how often Bigby messes with the crime scene.

'Wolf' is a very different sort of story: a noir murder mystery rather than the horror of man's inuhmanity to man. Unfortuantely, even taking that into account, the overall product feels much weaker.  That's not to say that Wolf is bad, exactly. I enjoyed it as often as not. That just means that about half the time I wasn't particularly engaged, either. I think there's some interesting characters here, they just don't always have interesting things to do. For every time that the plot moves in a really interesting direction, it also sort of plods off on some weird tangent that neither builds tension nor moves things forward. The action scenes sometimes look REALLY cool... and sometimes are overly long and very tedious.  I wouldn't recommend it to everyone, but if you're interested in a relatively by-the-numbers noir murder mystery framed in an interesting setting, it could be for you. The 25 dollar price tag may fit the production value of the game (which, as you might expect with TellTale, is top notch), but the quality of the story and gameplay may fall a bit under that.",

The game is more of an interactive story than a puzzler or exploration based point-n-click, but it has a killer (ha ha) plot featuring some great characters with persistent reactions to your choices. The noir-feel fits well with the premise of playing the sheriff on a murder case, but the strong narrative focus means you’ll, sadly, nearly always be a spectator to the actual sleuthing. Play this for the story.",

Lucky for us, Telltale managed to climb a little bit higher with The Wolf Among Us. Set in the iconic Fabletown of Bill Willingham's phenominal comic series, you play as Bigby Wolf (The Big Bad Wolf), as he tries to solve a series of gruesome murders. The atmosphere is dark, moody, and mature. The tone that is set by the art direction pays a deep and loving homage to such noir classics as The Maltese Falcon and Chinatown. The game's story is riveting and engaging, and the choices that are presented to the player feel like they matter! As Bigby Wolf, you feel like every decision you make has a deep impact on the lives of the other fables . . . and often, those decisions are tough to make! The Wolf Among Us has the look, the feel, and the narrative to come of the heels of The Walking Dead and not only hold its own, but shine in the process!  9.5/10",

Based off of the DC/Vertigo Comic books F.A.B.L.E.S, you are the sherrif in town: Bigby Wolf (aka The Big Bad Wolf). You police a town in New York called Fable Town which is run by Old King Cole (was a merry old soul...) and his right hand Snow White. Most of the FABLES went to live in Fable Town, assuming that they were either human looking or close to human. Anyone who wasn't (Puss in Boots, 3 Little Pigs, The 3 Bears etc) went to live on an upstate Farm called 'The Farm'. Bigby is not allowed on the Farm for obvious reasons, so having no where to put him, King Cole and Snow White made him the Sherrif of Fable Town.  This game follows one of many cases that Bigby has had to deal with.  It should also be noted that this game is set BEFORE the comic books. So although it is not necessary to read them to understand this game, I would still recommend that you pick up the graphic novels at some point as they are every bit as awesome as the game is....just...be kind to Colin...he falls on hard time in the comics ;-)  Pros: -Great Sound Track -Great Acting -Great Visual -Great Story  Cons: -QTE's but on some occasions, these are a necessary evil  What I would like to see improved in the next season: -More puzzles -More opportunities to use detective skills, allow the user to miss things etc  Can't wait for Season 2.

It’s for kids, right? Absolutely not. The Wolf Among Us, like the Fables comic books it’s based on is a mature experience. It is violent and gritty and deals with adult themes. These are not the characters and stories from sanitized animated movies; they’re bloody, sexy and have never been on the side of a child’s lunchbox.  Calm down TT, we get it. You want to be taken seriously. Will it help when some of the rough edges are smoothed? Of course. Until then, most players will take the game as it is. What is it? The first real step of the graphic novel that can create a stepping stone for other games. The Walking Dead is great, but it comes with the name. Stick it on most anything done half well and some money can be made. This shows that all the success wasn't just from the flash hit.

It a detective noir theme rather than a survival theme, as you basically play a sherrif investigating a conspiracy. It also takes place in a setting in which fables are real and are hiding out in a secret community in new york city. I personally found this to be really unique and refreshing, especially compared to Walking Dead's zombie apocalypse setting.   There are a few other key differences as well. Instead of choices being about who lives or dies, it's more about moral ambiguity. You will have to make a lot of really hard decisions with no clear right answer. Yes, in some cases it's as simply as do you kill this person or not, but like I said it's morally ambiguous.   One problem with this game is that there are too many characters that are totally unlikable. In fact, there was only a few characters in the entire cast that I didn't hate. It's really hard for a game to be morally ambiguous when everyone is constantly being a jerk. It broke the immersion somewhat but it wasn't too bad in my opinion.   This game as a really complex and interesting story though with a lot of twists and turns. It's excellently paced, the dialouge is well-written, and the voice-acting is top notch. I think this is the most reedming feature of the game. I was hooked and couldn't stop playing, I ended up playing all 5 episodes in one sitting. It was that good. It really sucks you in and makes you have to know what happens next.   When you combine all these features, The Wolf Among Us feels to me like the ultimate evoloution of storytelling games.   Take note that this game is a lot more adult than Walking Dead as well. There is constant cussing, A LOT of violence and gore, and plenty of adult themes.

You can make bigby a bad sheriff or a good one, choices like killing someone or not. fighting or not change every single thing in the story so you can't predict what is gonna happen and that is something i loved about it.    Gameplay  The gameplay is something i found consistent, it was good . and so cool when i was fighting with certain character i loved the fighting mechanics. They did a good job .    Graphics  It's a comic like game so the graphics are made to look like a comic and i enjoy it, its pretty good. (noth much to talk about)    Glitches  And here comes the bad part, well i did run in to some glitches like : This choice is blank and i couldn't do nothing else so i had to restart the game . but nothing that does too much damage cause the game has a REALLY good checkpoint saver (unlike skyrim)    Final result    9,9/10",

Less ponderous than The Walking Dead, the universe presented in The Wolf Among Us benefits from being easy to digest. The characters are steeped in both the comic's source material and from the fairy tales where Bigby and company originate. Because we can immediately place Snow, Ichabod and the Woodsman, there's no need to waste time on exposition. I don't think that was lost on the developers and it makes for a richer story.  And it is a good story! The writers keep things moving at a brisk pace, and it does keep you guessing. Your choices and their consequences however are a bit more ambiguous in this than the Walking Dead. And that's fine too, Fabletown is rife with moral ambiguity, so it fits.  Of middling concern is that It's not a terribly long game - but then again, it's not $60. On sale, as it is frequently, it's a bargain. it's about as good as can be made with TellTale's tech.  So, if you've got a few hours to kill and you want to be told a good tale, this is it.  But be nice to TJ woudja? He's just adorable, that little guy.",

            "review_text": "I don't know much of what can be said about The Wolf Among Us that hasn't been said by a lot of people. I will start by saying that I strongly recommend this game to 'most' gamers. Hardcore and Not so Hardcore alike. There are a few I know who wouldn't like the game for it's content.  Overall: Let me start off by saying this review is spoiler free. First, I almost didn't get this game, the subject matter, modern new york noir crime is NOT my thing. Yet, I got it on a deal with the recommendation of my friend. And I was blown away by the game.  Presentation: Gone are the extra frills you come to expect in most games, invintory puzzles, extra treasure hunts, pointless wander and collect. This game is liniar in the way a liniar game should be. The way of a storyteller. It uses strong nerrative, powerful and interesting backstories, combined with wonderful voice acting to create an immersive experiance that will make the time you spend on it blow by way too fast. It's short, but it's replayable much like your favorate movie of all time would be. Time flies when you're having fun and you WILL have fun.  Warnings: Next is my obligatory content warning, Blood and Gore, Violence, Violence towards women (Not you), Cussing, Nudity. Things that normally repel me. While this stuff still repels me and almost stopped me from buying the game, it was executed tastefully for the sake of the story, every drop of blood has a purpose, every violent action has a reason, rather you know it, or figure it out or not. The cussing is executed naturally, though rather gratuatously. And the brief bits of nudity were not overly highlighted and ended up adding to the atmosphere. Would I let a kid play it? HELL NO!  Lore Nut: As a fan of comics, as a fan of the Grimm Fairy tales, this was told from a more origional book context that a lot of the retellings that were watered down for kids of our generation. Some tales had insinuated incest (attempts at least), grim details, blood. To be honest, I think the kids of the era grim wrote sort of grew up on the Noir of their era.  The Badass: There were tons of badass moments throughout the game, from the first punch swung in the first chapter to the climactic boss battles, to the way Bigby Wolf even acts, he is an honest to god badass in ever sense of the word. No matter how tame you play him to be, he is one dangerous person, and someone you would not want on your badside.  Unique Aspect: The draw to people normally not of the subject matter. My sister for instance came over and I talked her into playing it. She despises cussing more than I do, despises new york's setting, hates gore, and abhors cussing. And she was caught into the storyline, the characters interested her, and I could tell some of them pushed her buttons, but never enough to cause her to set the game down.  Who shouldn't pick up the game: People who don't play games for stories. People who have small children watching over their shoulder every moment they game. People who play games for collecting, to waste time, grind hounds, or people simply wanting their next headshot.  Who should play this game: Everyone else. People who said to themselves: I'd love to play an interactive movie. Fable comic fanatics. People who love solving problems or using logic, but not wanting to have to use a spreadsheet... YOU! Yes, You who's sitting in your chair after reading the who shouldn't list and saying to yourself: That doesn't describe me at all. Hell, I even recomend this game to people who normally don't like the grittiness as long as they're willing to enter it with an opened mind and try something new.",

The art design is lovely, remaining true to the story's roots in comic form. It has the 2D look in a 3D format, reminiscent of the Borderlands series, thought with a slightly different stylistic spin. Familiar and new characters abound, the story is solid, engaging and full of sufficient misdirection to keep the mystery interesting, and the game boasts some of the best voice acting I have ever heard.  The drawbacks are few, but depending on the player, these could be smaller or larger irritants.   Achievements are almost nonexistent and consist only of character/place/information unlocks and chapter completeions.  More significantly, he points at which the player takes physical control of Bigby's movements can be a bit awkward; I've never been a fan of straight up WASD movement controls (no mouse involvement). Fighting mechanics are extremely simplistic, consisting of random direction dodging, mouse clicks on targetted areas and fillling up a strength bar through keymashing. As these aspects are not the larger focus of the game, I have a great deal of forgiveness for it, even though Bigby took quite a few unnecessary punches due to unclear timing while I was in the driver's seat. In my opinion, the graphic style, plot and voice acting made up more than admirably for any wonky mini fights/detection scenarios.  I can't speak to the replayability of the game at this time, but would seem to be enough alternate choices that it could well warrant 2 or more additional runs of the campaign.  A hearty thumbs up for a visually pleasing game. Great characters, excellent story, well put together. A perfect tie-in to an Eisner award winning title.",

            "review_text": "The Wolf Among Us is another brilliant experience from Telltale Games. For everyone that doesn't know, the story is based on the Fables series of comics written by Bill Willingham. You play as one of the main characters from the comics, Bigby Wolf. Once known as the Big Bad Wolf, Bigby is the sheriff of Fabletown which is a part of New York City where the Fables reside.  The story starts with a simple noise complaint from Toad and progresses as events in Fabletown spiral out of control. Fables who don't have natural human forms have to purchase glamours to make them appear as humans. Any non-human Fable who doesn't is sent to a rural community known as 'The Farm'. The end of the game, which is the 1st season, leaves you in a cliffhanger situation which will make you instantly want to play the next game.  The games uses the same point-and-click system as the Walking Dead games from Telltale Games. The player can chose what Bigby says and does during conversations and can explore areas that they're in. The combat system, which is mainly quick time events, involves the use of the wasd keys, repeatedly tapping q and, obviously, pointing and clicking.  The combination of involved gameplay and an interesting story really make this game stand out. I really enjoyed it and I recommend it. If you liked the Walking Dead games or you have an interest in the murder mystery genre, you'll also enjoy this game.  +Great Story +Amazing Voice Acting +Good Combat System +Attractive Art Style +Fun Gameplay  9/10  Side Note - The game doesn't use many resourses. I ran it on an AMD E-450 notebook which was connected to a 1080p monitor. It ran at over 30fps on 720p with maxed out settings.

Characters are enjoyable and the protagonist feels just right for the setting (And the setting and graphic style are awesome). The fights are pretty nice imo and well made. Im really impressed with the amount of options in both dialog and fights, im sure some will feel that there should be more options, but i think its just right.  The only two things i feel is negative is the sound, its good but i wish they had gone all out on the sound quality. And the other is that you die/lose if you do some things wrong, i wish they would have just added alternate progression for all fights/dialogue options instead of some leading to death/failure. You start over literally from where you failed, and that feels like an odd way of doing it imo.",

For those who aren't aware, it revolves around a bunch of different fairy-tale characters called Fables, such as Snow White, Ichabod Crane, The Little Mermaid, and most importantly, the Big Bad Wolf. The game is tailored by the choices you make, and your decisions can lead to good or bad things later down the road, as I'm sure most of you who have played Telltale games before already know.   The reason I loved this game so much is because it takes a bunch of fairy-tale characters that you already know and puts them all together in this dark, grimy story, and it's really interesting to see it all. That's also the reason I enjoyed this more than The Walking Dead; the setting was just overall more appealing to me, and I really liked The Walking Dead, so if you're like me, you will love this game.  Overall, the story is excellent and the only real complaint I have is one I have also had with The Walking Dead, and that is the fact that some of the dialogue choices aren't clear whether they are going to be nice or mean, and you might end up picking something thinking it's going to be one thing and really it's the other. The dialogue can also be iffy at times, but it doesn't take away from the story whatsoever, just a small annoyance. I really love this game, and I recommend it to anyone who appreciates Telltale games and dark, fairy-tale stories.  ",

            "review_text": "Overall good sound-track (I love the menu theme), good voice-acting as always, strong dialogues and that are often humorous; better free roam scenes than in The Walking Dead with smoother mouse control and better camera angles; consistent and believable characters, one of which you can shape yourself; better graphics than in The Walking Dead. Also, the world of The Wolf Among Us is way better than The Walking Dead. It's incredibly original and fun to explore. Another main difference between The Walking Dead are the kind of choices you have to make. In The Walking Dead, you choose with the purpose to maximize you chances of survival, whereas in The Wolf Among Us, you do not choose to survive but to unveil the truth as fast as possible. The Walking Dead is more of a survival horror game, whereas The Wolf Among Us is a whodunit.  Episode One: Faith  8/10  Episode Two: Smoke and Mirrors  The second episode primarily focusses on the story, there's only one combat scene and two nice plottwists. I was pleasantly surprised by the variety of scenes in this episode: you being interrogated, you interrogating/torturing, a post-mortem body examination, visiting a brothel, visiting a murder site, etc. The play time is around 2 hours, and could be longer although 10 hours (approx. 5*2) for 20 euros is actually a good deal. Still, the episodic releases do slow the game down and I think you should play all episodes after one another to really feel like you get a 10 hour game.  8/10  Episode Three: A Crooked Mile  Starts off with a blast. Does a good job at keeping introducing characters steadily. Good nuancing of the characters of Bigby and Snow. A rather short episode, slow-paced and focusses on deepening the mystery instead of giving answers or fights. The now habitual fight at the end is not really convincing, but you are presented with one really hard choice. However, when replaying the episode I couldn't help but notice that you have hardly any impact at all on the story, and decisions made in previous episodes are also insignificant for the present. What also struck me was the queer randomness of pop-ups like '... will remember that.' Throwing some dialogue options that merely affects a handful of spoken lines but nothing significant, and adding a pop-up here and there do a good job at creating the feeling the player makes a significant difference, but most of that is sadly an illusion.  7/10  Episode Four: In Sheep's Clothing  8/10  Episode Five: Cry Wolf  Overall, this episode doesn't look very polished. The beginning fight is somewhat choppy and doesn't play very fluent and the background music is also almost non-existant. The acting and voice-acting is also not very convincing especially moments of stress. Bigby's wolf form is not very detailed and the fight with Bloody Mary should be the climax of the episode but isn't really.  At the end of episode four, you had the feeling you didn't know anything, but that doesn't get much better. Although some infractions of the Crooked Man are revealed, you can't really fathom fully what he's about. Bloody Mary also, elaborating on her personality? Nope.  Good to see that the Crooked Man's has some charisma however which makes for an interesting ending scene, and cool that he confronts you with some of your choices, but in the end, it doesn't matter, like most (if not all) choices you make in this game actually.   7/10  All in all a (much) better, more interesting and more original series than The Walking Dead and well worth the price.",

I initially was deterred by a screenshot of an oversized anthropomorphic toad, but I went ahead anyway and I'm glad I did, because TWAU is a well realized and interesting setting of various fairy tale characters trying to build and maintain a community in the ordinary (“real”) world.  You play as the sherif of Fable Town trying to solve a murder mystery. I don't think it is an especially well constructed plot, but it's definitely worthwhile and carried by the atmospheric setting and dialogues. Most of the gameplay consist of dialogue choices, which influence character opinion and behavior, but there aren't major branches in the story – the course is set but you can rock the boat a little left or right along the way. Don't get me wrong however, the storytelling is great and can be emotionally engaging; the game likes to set you up with dilemmas balancing allegiance, restraint and promises between characters.  There are small amounts of QTEs to navigate, but their role is simply to make action sequences seem and feel more interactive. There's no difficulty to anything and no actual puzzle solving required. In that respect TWAU is less of a game and more of an interactive story with player choices adding personal flavour to the protagonist's personality and development.    Strong points  Good storytelling and dialogue Interesting setting, great atmosphere Moral dilemmas   Weak points  Chapters 2 and 4 somewhat lacking Limited replay value Average mystery plot More sightseeing than active player-driven crime solving   Grade B ",

I feel the story itself picked up really strong keeping the players lust for next episode(Which there no longer a need to wait for since the game is, for now, complete). However, during the middle of the game I felt the episodes got shorter and could have contained more. I felt like there was not covered, and that there was a lot more room for expansion during the middle episodes. The game's final episodes were to the same standard as the beginning of the series and lived up to the Telltale name. Overall I feel this game is worth buying as it does provide a lot of content which is embedded with player choice/consiquence, very likeable/hateable characters which you can feel a connection to and finally a great in depth story line which holds the playets attention all the way through with replayable capatability as there is much content to cover that you may not see.",

The only downside to this game is the bug that I, and some others have encountered, where the choices are replaced with 'This Choice Is Blank!' and the game won't play. The only 'fix' is quitting the game and starting up again. While somewhat minor, it could be game breaking to some if they get it, and it is a bit of an annoyance.

You get this kind of a setting. You play Bigby Wolf... Aka 'Big B Wolf', aka Big Bad Wolf. He's trying to turn his life around after terrorizing countless fables and mundies and currently the Sherrif of the fables in a Vampire-esque Masquerade to pass as human. And like any detective story, Bigby's day goes bad with a murder.  It's another episodic game from Tell Tale, you get one episode now, and another four as they are released, all five for a single $25 payment. Sorry, no way to get just one episode.  Story: Like The Walking Dead, this is based on a graphic novel, specifically Fables. So expect writing that's already proven itself in another medium.  Gameplay: Limited, admittedly. Point-n-click adventuring mixed in with some quick-time events and a lot of conversations with options. The game keeps track of the choices you've made, and it'll be interesting to see how they affect later episodes.  Graphics: Tell Tale's signature graphic-novel-esque style, tightened a bit from their last foray to cut down on floating lines. Works well with the story.  Audio: The voice acting is top-shelf, and anyone who talks has a voice actor. Special effects are reasonably effective, though there's not much that turns up for a story like this.  Overall, I'd recommend this if you're a fan of adventure games or favor story above detailed gameplay. I know I'm egerly waiting for the next epidoe.",

Many people criticize this game for its choices that have no affect and its bad ending. I can agree to an extent with the choices, but the ending was thoroughly satisfying even though it couldn't be the perfect fairy tale all is well ending everyone wanted, it just wouldn't fit in with the game's style.  Back to the choices. Their are several choices in the game that have a very major impact on the story. People tend to have a huge gripe with the fact not all the choices are like this. I get the argument but not every choice can change the whole landscape of the game. However, once you start stringing small choices together you can see how they are making an impact and it can entirely change how a situation plays out even if it doesn't directly effect the end result.  Though you don't have complete freedom to do whatever you want like many of us would have hoped, it is still satisfying to punch someone in the face for being an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ instead of having to sit there and watch it play out however the writers decide.  The games story is probably the best in any game from recent memory and has many meaningful twist and turns without being too far-fetched and in the end you get to serve up justice (or not) however you see fit which is incredibly satisfying despite the fact not everyone will agree with your decision.   My only complaint about the game is that it ended and there is no sequel in sight. 9.5/10  ",

            "review_text": "*Keep in mind, that I'm not that good at speaking English, but I hope it's okay for you.*   EPISODE ONE:  I just finished episode one, and if the game continues that awesome, I'm happy to recommend it to anyone who liked The Walking Dead, but also to all of those, who didn't like the zombie-setting of The Walking Dead. Until now, it tells an adult story about fables, with loads of choices to make (which really DO have consequences!) and loads of violence. It's again more a movie than a game. Furthermore, some fairytales are told further, to say what happend after the 'happily ever after part', and it's not only very human, but still excellently fitting. How cool's that?  EPISODE TWO:  First off, I've had major problems playing this episode. Until I re-installed my entirely PC and played through episode one again, the game always crashed when starting episode two.  With this being said, now to the review itself: I'm somehow torn about this episode. It still is really great written and intense to follow, it's highly enjoyable and the story developes in a very interesting way. There also aren't any cliches, so that's quite good. However, episode two is pretty short. It only took me around one and a half hour to finish it, compared to the two and a half hour I needed for episode one. I have no idea what took them the four months we had to wait for episode two to be released. It still is quite much work, but they promised to not do this, so I hope they also not fail with The Walking Dead Season two, because if they will again, I won't buy their games right at the release of episode one anymore, but wait for the entire product to be released. Don't get me wrong, I still liked episode two really much, and I have nothing against waiting like two months or so for the next episode, but four months is somehow too much.  To sum up: It's a great second episode, though I'd like them to update the game more frequently.  EPISODE THREE: I'm literally suffering right now. Nothing more to say. This episode has been phenominal, more than just outstanding entertainment. I'm writing this while still being affected by the thoughts the ending left me with, so this part of the review is going to be full of emotional nonsense, but I hope that you therefore can see what this game manages to DO to the player.  This is not the shallow crime/romance story you can watch on TV or read in books. This is pure hardcore to decide, both emotional and rational desicions to be made, and the game plays with your feelings. It creates a happy atmosphere, and a few seconds later it dissolves the camouflage and hits you right in the face with terrible desicions you don't ever want to focus in real life. Episode three is, in my opinion, the very best episode of any Telltale game out yet, and I'd highly advise you to buy and play to the game right now if you haven't already. It leaves you breathless, sweating, struggling to control your feelings (for example, I felt a mixture of deep inner pain and aggressiveness, suffer and sadness) and ads a grandiose cliffhanger at the end which will leave you begging for the release of the next episode.  EPISODE FOUR: Take the same as what I wrote for Episode 3, and downgrade it just by a very little. This is how much I liked Episode 4, and also everything I wrote about Episode 3 pretty much applies for Episode 4 aswell. No need to double things.  EPISODE FIVE: I'll keep this as short as possible to get you as excited as possible. This episode has got more drama, more talking, less fighting and a better ending than each episode before. The cliffhanger at the end is great and keeps you guessing what is there to come in Season 2. I wish everyone of you a great time playing this game. I loved it over The Walking Dead Season ONE and Season TWO (even though one episode is missing there), which might also be because of that special setting the fables make for. All both major and minor decisions you made throughout any of the episodes before is taken into account and it all comes together to a great final, able to mess with Breaking Bad, and for me, even win the direct comparison. That's video game history, the way stories should be told. That's entertainment at it's purest. That's 'The Wolf Among Us', one of the most thrilling experiences you'll ever get in your live when it comes to grandious stories and being able to help it evolve. Have fun playing, and happy suffering throughout the intense stages. Thanks for reading. :)",

It has many twists and turns and just like every telltale game it does a very good job of reflecting your choices which gives you the feeling that your having a large impact on what happens later. but unfortunatly some people may not enjoy this game because of the fact there are not many chances to actually interact with the game beyond finding clues and talking to people which just might not be enought for some people, but with this in mind i believe this game is whole heartedly worth your time and money. 9/10",

            "review_text": "The Wolf Among Us (TWAU) serves as a good introduction to the Fables comic book universe. The strengths of this game lie primarily in the story where we see Bigby Wolf towing the line between doing his job and letting the devils of his nature get the better of him. Less successful is the stripped down gameplay.  LIke most games in the 'adventure' genre, gameplay is composed of multiple choice dialogue options and room investigation with added QTE cut scenes for dramtaic flavour. The dialogue trees are fine but there is a lack of interactivity outside of QTE sequences. The moments were you can walk around a room investigating are few and precious. Although it certainly helps the story ticking along, I would have welcomed the opportunity to explore areas at the players descretion rather than when the plot called for it. This is a fault with the gameplay template set out by the Walking Dead where, being in the midst of a zombie apocalypse, the only opportunities to explore are in barricaded areas, otherwise the player was on a journey and couldn't revisit areas. TWAU revolves around the same few locations most of the time. Some of the rooms you visit are even in the same building.  As for the episodic structure, I bought this game just before the release of episode 5 so I didn't have to wait between episodes and I recommend this strategy for any episodic series. Without regular scheduling any tension from cliffhangers could be forgotten if there is a large gap between episodes.  None of these criticisms break the game however. Though no more than an interactiv-ish movie, it is an entertaining one. The characters are relatable and the story is engaging although lacking in the emotional punch of the Walking Dead. Even if you have no interest in the comics (which I haven't read), TWAU is self-contained enough to stand on it's own four paws without depending on established Fables or fairy tale lore. Of course if you don't know who the Big Bad Wolf or Snow White is, then this game may not be for you.  A good story but lacking in interactivity makes for a lean, digestable, but passive experience.  Obligatory score:  3/5 ",

It's stylish and beautiful to look at with a very engaging story. Voice acting is spot on as is the atmosphere and the film noir feeling. You care for the characters who are very well fleshed out. In some ways this game reminds me of the Gabriel Knight series. It has that same mysterious mood with magic and some romance thrown in.  I think my main qualm with this game (and the Walking Dead) is the amount of time you get to make a decision in some instances during dialogue options. I don't even have time to read or hear what is being said when the time to make a decision runs out. Is that really necessary to make the 'decision mechanic' work? Seems more irritating than anything really.",

            "review_text": "Fantastic game from the makers of the popular 'Walking Dead' games. Personally, I liked this game much better than 'The Walking Dead.' Both titles excel in their story-driven gameplay, but the stories each game tells are very different and give a different gaming experience. Whereas 'TWD' is essentially a story of survival, akin to the genre of horror games, 'The Wolf Among Us' is a mystery story. While there are moments of danger, life and death are no longer the driving force, but rather the player's interest rests in solving the mystery.  Is that mystery engaging? Yes. Yes, it is. The mystery entangles plenty of suspects -- almost everyone in the game is suspect of something at one point or another. And these characters have good qualities as well. The player will probably be torn between wanting to believe in these characters and doubting every word they say. The main character, Bigby Wolf, also undergoes significant development as a character, the exact direction of which depends on the way the player chooses to play the game, of course. But it all results in remarkably engaging story-telling.  The story is set in New York City, and it seemlessly blends all of the well-known fairy tale characters -- as well as some from other kinds of stories such as urban legends -- into a seedy, poverty-wrecked new world of crime and deception. For those who aren't a fan of fairy tales, don't worry because the crime element will give the story an edge. For those who don't like criminal mysteries, don't worry because the fairy tale element will keep things imaginitive.  Lastly, I just have to mention that all of the above make me like the game. It is the animation and the sound that make me love it. The colors, the style, the music -- it's all perfect for what the game is.  I thought I wouldn't like this game, but I'm so glad I gave it a try. I highly recommend that others do the same.",

The story is great, well paced and gripping the whole way through. The art and graphics are on point. I can't wait to see where else telltale take this series.",

Telltale Games shows off their trademark player choice system which really affects the story, as the player you can feel the consequence of your choices. I feel the story itself picked up really strong keeping the players lust for next episode(Which there no longer a need to wait for since the game is, for now, complete). However, during the middle of the game I felt the episodes got shorter and could have contained more. I felt like there was not covered, and that there was a lot more room for expansion during the middle episodes. The game's final episodes were to the same standard as the beginning of the series and lived up to the Telltale name. Overall I feel this game is worth buying as it does provide a lot of content which is embedded with player choice/consiquence, very likeable/hateable characters which you can feel a connection to and finally a great in depth story line which holds the playets attention all the way through with replayable capatability as there is much content to cover that you may not see.",

The art design is lovely, remaining true to the story's roots in comic form. It has the 2D look in a 3D format, reminiscent of the Borderlands series, thought with a slightly different stylistic spin. Familiar and new characters abound, the story is solid, engaging and full of sufficient misdirection to keep the mystery interesting, and the game boasts some of the best voice acting I have ever heard.  The drawbacks are few, but depending on the player, these could be smaller or larger irritants.   Achievements are almost nonexistent and consist only of character/place/information unlocks and chapter completeions.  More significantly, he points at which the player takes physical control of Bigby's movements can be a bit awkward; I've never been a fan of straight up WASD movement controls (no mouse involvement). Fighting mechanics are extremely simplistic, consisting of random direction dodging, mouse clicks on targetted areas and fillling up a strength bar through keymashing. As these aspects are not the larger focus of the game, I have a great deal of forgiveness for it, even though Bigby took quite a few unnecessary punches due to unclear timing while I was in the driver's seat. In my opinion, the graphic style, plot and voice acting made up more than admirably for any wonky mini fights/detection scenarios.  I can't speak to the replayability of the game at this time, but would seem to be enough alternate choices that it could well warrant 2 or more additional runs of the campaign.  A hearty thumbs up for a visually pleasing game. Great characters, excellent story, well put together. A perfect tie-in to an Eisner award winning title.",

Quick-time events as noted above were often really sudden and could catch one off guard if they weren't paying close attention at a point, which is why I would recommend pausing the game whenever you aren't full attention. Also, very linear in terms of interactions, very few things that provide depth to the in-game world outside of anything directly relevant to the storyline.

The strong part is the story, set in rich setting of Fabletown, the town where all the Fables (characters from stories, myths and so on) live in modern times. You play as a hard-♥♥♥ Big Bad Wolf (or sheriff Bigby Wolf, whatever you like) going through the story to unravel a series of mysterious events. The dialogues are great, characters are interesting, the ending is pretty spectacular.

Of course, much like the real world, everybody is always unhappy with something, regardless if you're doing your best to please them or just letting them drown in their own misery. It essentially comes down to your own conscience of morality. Ask someone politely to leave before things get nasty or cut straight to the chase by ripping a guys arm off to show that you're not messing around, the choice is yours  The five chapters are thuroughly solid throughout and with regular accord leave you numerous opportunities that will embrace a complacent feeling within you. The music is varied and the art style is gorgeously stunning and perhaps the most appealing aspect about the entire game, truly fitting for telling the story it does.

The reason I loved this game so much is because it takes a bunch of fairy-tale characters that you already know and puts them all together in this dark, grimy story, and it's really interesting to see it all. That's also the reason I enjoyed this more than The Walking Dead; the setting was just overall more appealing to me, and I really liked The Walking Dead, so if you're like me, you will love this game.  Overall, the story is excellent and the only real complaint I have is one I have also had with The Walking Dead, and that is the fact that some of the dialogue choices aren't clear whether they are going to be nice or mean, and you might end up picking something thinking it's going to be one thing and really it's the other. The dialogue can also be iffy at times, but it doesn't take away from the story whatsoever, just a small annoyance.

You Play as sheriff Bigby Wolf AKA. The Big Bad Wolf. You are challenged with a murder investigation, and the rest goes on from there.  This game is a very well built choose your own adventure game, and when it says that every choice you make decides the game for you, Telltale REALLY meant it. For the full Experiance of this game I would recommend playing it through twice.  The entire plot of this game is separated into 5 shocking, dark, and exciting episodes.  The amount of Characters in this game is astounding. To explain It would say, think of every fairy tale and nursery ryme you have ever heard. Thats basically the characters in this game.  If you couldn't tell already, I absoulutly adore this game. Telltale is famous for hand crafting amazing stories, and this game proves that. The story is really dark, and brooding, You want to know what is going to happen next. And how all of the characters are in the state they are in, is very interesting to see.  Now I know that I have made this seem like this game can do no wrong, their are a few things wrong with this game. The first of which being, THAT THE GAME IS SOOOOO SHORT! This game took me only 6 hours two complete, for me thats about 3 sittings. If you played the walking dead than this wouldn't surpise you, and the game kind of makes up for it with its replay value, but IMO its way to short. A second problem I had is that there were some very strange gamebreaking bugs that happened ever so often. The bug wouldn't let me select a option to talk and would skip the scenes and than go back to the scenes that it skipped, just a weird bug though.  All in all, this game is fantastic, a must buy, IMO one of the greatest stories ever told in gaming. 9/10!",

It feels a lot like a TV series or movie, the dialogue is brilliant and you'll find yourself chuckling a bit at it probably too at times.  While the controls are not always that great, they also aren't much of a hurdle either.  The only thing I really didn't like was, when the timer ran at a kinda awkward speed and I missed two kinda (for me at least) important dialogue options by simply clicking a milisecond too late. Then you sit there and go 'hhhrmpf' and there is no way to rewind the time a bit, would be a neat feature if you ask me, because It's not always entirely obvious how fast the timer runs, until you look down from the text. So, yeah, imho if you didn't choose anything, inadvertently, you should maybe be allowed to rewind to the last dialogue promp, more could maybe destroy the replay value too much.  The characters are refreshingly non-twodimensional for the most part, which is also a big plus. Also pretty sure that these kinds of games, due to the art-style, will stay evergreens for a long time, since they got that comic-look down almost perfectly.

'google it if you dont get it'  its nice mature tale and it can get pretty heavy really fast. the thing about it is, the cast may seem very flip floppy, but thast more on you then them. figure out what type of bigby you are and stay to it. dont flop from over the top pleasing to over the top attack everyone. pick a role. makes the tale smoother and better, gives it much more depth  now for the action or other click based stuff. its telltale game guys and gals, it moves like you think it does. solidly movement if a bit rigid when walking but all in all its pleasant, the quick time events flow smoothly for me though some may find the them to be faster then alot of games do it.  the fights are dramatic in the way that an old Pi film is, a bit over the top, maybe a bit to zealous in thier performance, but frankly its what the game needs. pleasantly plopping you from dialogue to crime solving into an extreme fight at pace i find very well done.  and the game keeps you on your toes, some events are out of the blue or others you can feel coming. some are unavoidable and just ♥♥♥♥ing happen.  needless to say id give this game ten out of ten, great art, fluid movemnets, a nice mature grit filled tale depth if you stay your role and dont flip more then two faces coin. and the soundtrack, aww its perfect..   to sum it up, the wolf amoung not only nails a killer title, it nails everything the game needs to to impress and draw you back.  and when ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan.

The episodes have a noir-feel to it and I like that.   As you play with Bigby you decide how he should behave. Is he using violence or does he talk everyone into admitting the trouble they are in? Almost good cop, bad cop you might say. But I won't spoil more about the story itself. Only downside are the controls for the PC in quick time events, they feel a bit clumsy. When you are caught up in the game you have to look down to find them (at least I did).

            "review_text": "I end up getting drawn to games from odd places, in 'The Wolf Among Us'' case, the odd place was Miracle of Sound's 'Dog's Life' tribute song. The song is great of course, but the visual style and colour (my goodness, the colour!) I saw in the music video made it a must get. Now I've played it I'm really glad I picked it up. It's also convinced me to give the comics a go, something I wouldn't have considered had I not had an introduction to the world and characters first. (Frankly the premise alone sounded a little odd, and the recent appearance of 'Once' on telly (with it's similar hook) just seemed really corny in a Buffy and Charmed meets disney properties way). But, this game! This is the first proper modern style point and click I have played and finished (30 mins of Life is Strange doesn't really count) and the only TellTale game I've played to my knowledge. So, if you're not a fan of that style of game play, i.e. wandering around looking at things and doing QTEs this might not be for you. On the other hand, the murder-mystery plot actually lends itself to this style of game as you methodically search crime scenes and navigate dialogue options to make a prisoner open up or talk you way out of a sticky situation.  But eventually punches are going to get thrown, you are afterall, stepping into the shoes of Fabletown's chain smoking detective Bigby Wolf; reformed Big, Bad Wolf now werewolf trying to balance justice with staying alive. The Telltale engine doesn't feel totally geared towards full scale action but it's nicely presented with good cuts between moments and relatively few of those sticky jumps you get from option based gameplay. As I mentioned the semi-cell shaded comic book style visuals really suits the game. Besides being consistantly nice to look at there's a great 80's style vibe with lots of neon pops of colour as well richly detailed interiors, the most impressive being the Woodlands Business Office and several of the appartments which all reflect their owner's personalities. Having never met the characters of Fabletown before I was pleasently suprised by the characters who appeare and how they are portrayed. As an example, in episode 1 you'll meet a down on his luck landlord Toad of Toadhall complete with british accent and Collin, one of the three little pigs, who crashes at Bigby's place because Bigby owns him one for that one time when his house was blown down... The sound design is also rather good. The voice cast is well chosen and the vocals never feel jarringly out of tone. The music is very fitting with the main theme being a particular favourite of mine. Some of the sound effects are also rather marvalous, an ememy from Episode 5 has particularly chilling sound design. Besides that, Bigby's wolfish nature often bubbles up as growls and snarls which work rather well.  If there's one ctiticism I have it's this: I've played through the game twice with a couple of different choices made but I've yet to discover just how drastically different characters will act depending on what you say or how you act. Indeed an early choice drastically changes the outcome of a stituation with only the barest clue as to what the outcome would be if you chose the alternative path. I've yet to do a 'big, bad wolf' run as it were where I pick the most agreesive, violent and nasty options and I think I will find it hard simply because I've come to like the characters too much. Final word of warning, if you don't notice the age rating prior to playing like I did (I'm at an age where I don't need to bother about them, y'see) you might be suprised by the adult language and themes (it's based on fairy tales after all!). Just be warned. I'm usually a bit sensitive to that sort of thing (especially violence and gore) but the game being styalised how it is goes a long way. If you'd rather not hear anthropomorphic toads swear like cockney gangsters this game might not be for you. If you can get past that, you're in for a treat.  'The Wolf Among Us' gets a very firm recomendation from me.   Tl:dr Great film noir murder mystery story Gorgeous visuals Fun characters Replay value",

In TWAU, your choices matter.   Sure, in the grand scheme of things the endings are all along the same lines, but your actions, their effects on the world, characters and your own sense of justice all make a difference throughout the game. What makes this interesting is that you'll constantly be piecing together mysteries, meaning decisions can fall under both moral and logical umbrellas.   If you've played any of the Ace Attorney games (or similar) and found the linear 'safety harness' preventing you from falling too far from the correct train of thoughts irritating, you'll be pleased to know TWAU is not afraid to let you go off the tracks a bit. For example, I'm considering replaying the game myself simply because I felt I made some poor decisions regarding what to investigate, who to accuse, and so on.  The game is VERY linear, although of course scenes can and will play out differently depending on your actions (and you get some opportunities to visit different areas over others in search of clues). As the game's protagonist, Bigby Wolf, 'you' have a reasonable degree of ways to interpret his character, from a team player to a lone wolf (ha) and anywhere inbetween.  My only really complaint with the game that sometimes I felt there were scenes where none of the dialogue options really fitted what I wanted to say, but those times were infrequent and didn't have much of an impact on my enjoyment or immersion.  So basically, TWAU is a fantastic murder mystery tale with well-written characters, a satisfying story which never slows down and which pulls some impressive twists. If you even have a vague interest in what you've see and read, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.",

The story is fantastically well-written, and the characters feel lifelike enough for you to get a real feel of how they will act under certain circumstances (which is necessary to make some of the tougher decisions). If I HAD to have a complaint with the game, it'd be that you can't get every achievement on a single playthrough, and some achievements require that you make rather deplorable decisions. But they're just achievements, who cares?  I can't recommend The Wolf Among Us enough.

Finally the time had come; and I was downloading and installing the game as fast as my system would process.  I played a little over 2 hours; and the game was over! That's right! Two Hours Long! Shortest game I ever played! As disappointing has this may sound; I couldn't stop playing the game. I loved every minute of it; and in the end, wanted more!! But this is a episodic game; and so my $25 when for all five episodes, for which I now have to wait until Telltale releases the second part; Smoke &amp; Mirrors. It's like reading the freakin comic book!! You get it. Read the hell out of it, and now have to wait til next month for #2!!  Aaaaaarrrrrrhhhhh!!!!  But I'm hooked!! I want more!! I want to play again; but I'm afraid my new choices will change the game play when E2 comes out. So I'll wait until all five are out and done with before playing it again; so as not to change any of the relationships I have set in motion! All go for the acheivements then, too.  If you are thinking of picking it up; go for it!! If you feel like waiting for all five parts to be out; I say, if you can wait that long, go for it!! Either way; this game was worth the wait and the two hour play time!!﻿  P.S. Game Informer magazine stated the The Wolf Among Us; 'Made the Wolf Inside Us Hungry For More', and I totally agree!!",

Yes, there are the Fables comic books, which are lovely, but there is something about controlling the action yourself that just draws you into a narrative.

You can't get stuck unless you're a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the quick-action 'fight' scenes, the main challenge is to get all the Achievements from trying out various dialogue branches over at least a couple of playthroughs and seeing where different choice paths lead.  I wasn't aware of the Fables comics before playing this, just like I wasn't aware that The Walking Dead was based on comics (not the TV show), and the Bone games, and even the Puzzle Agent games. Telltale does a good job of popularizing these brilliantly creative worlds with those of us who don't really buy comics.  It is quite a violent game, but only in that detached comical way, and of course adult themes prevail throughout, so if that's all cool with you and you're just up for some casual gameplay, go out and buy this. But its full price is a little bit high I'd say, definitely wishlist it and wait until it comes down to at least -50%. I say that here, but I almost always do this in my game purchases anyway.

            "review_text": "Telltale Studios came into the spotlight with their Walking Dead game — which went on to win many, many game of the year awards and the praise of consumers and critics alike. It was also a game that I didn't particularly care for. Admittedly, I only played the first two chapters and the voice acting and gameplay was quite good, but the story itself did not grab me like it seemed to do to others. I'm over the whole zombie thing. However, with The Wolf Among Us, Telltale has successfully recaptured my attention. They've produced a high-quality game with careful attention to good storytelling. While the gameplay might be minimal, the performances, direction, and script will keep you invested till the last moment.  If I were to describe The Wolf Among Us, I'd say it's equal parts Drive, and Chinatown with the aesthetic of something like Only God Forgives. It's a intricate detective story (an immediate interest for me) following the Big Bad Wolf (now just called Bigby, in his human form) as he teams up with Snow White in the search for a serial killer who's recent actions have disturbed the 'peaceful' community of Fabletown — a community of fairy tale characters located in the Bronx New York. However, as Bigby progresses, he tests the limits of himself (physically and mentally), his friends, and the community as he unravels a plot much bigger than himself. The plot starts off great and just keeps getting better. There's a constant sense of mystery, a legitimate interest in the results of the case, and the identity of the perpetrator. Telltale's script is tight and focused, yet allowing for ample amounts of flexibility and player choice. The dialogue is perfectly delivered by the accomplished voice actors, adding to the gritty mix of realism and fantasy. The story is just plain great — it checks off all the important boxes for success and even adds a few more. While the ending may feel a little messy in its ultimately satisfying payoff, the plot is riveting from start to finish. It clocks in at a solid length too, it can probably be finished in anywhere from 8-12 hours, depending on how much stuff you investigate. The replayability comes almost entirely from the choice based gameplay — allowing players to play again, choosing different dialogue paths. In addition, there are a few hidden 'Book of Fables' pages that can be unlocked from different choices and investigations. It's an engaging ride, and one that keeps you thinking and wanting for more.  Like I said, the gameplay is pretty minimal. When boiled down, it's comprised of quicktime combat events and investigation scenes in a mix of classic point-and-click gameplay and L.A. Noire investigation. I would've been perfectly happy with The Wolf Among Us being a TV miniseries, but it works very well as a game. The choice aspects and quick-time combat involve the player enough to be a true gaming experience. The combat is pretty fun, and adds to the game viscerally, but there are the occasional 'mash Q' button prompts that are impossible to win (according to the story). It's a tad frustrating, but not a big gripe. Overall, the gameplay is mostly comprised of ticking dialogue boxes, but the aforementioned high production values keep the game interesting.   The graphics are simply gorgeous. The game's aesthetic is alluringly saturated, giving off a distinct 80s/neo-noir vibe. The comic book mixed with realism is a style Telltale is known for, and it works just as well as it did in The Walking Dead. It's also clear that Telltale's trademark aesthetic is not a cheap way of using lower quality assets, but a deliberate artistic choice that wouldn't have worked in any other way. The Wolf Among Us is slick, gorgeous, and tremendously rendered.   It's also nice to know that Wolf doesn't use its fairy tale setting as a gimmick. This story could have only been told with these characters. It could've ended up as a lame detective story with normal characters reskinned as fables. However, the tales and the characters involved ingrained in the story's core so as to where they're integral. Good on Telltale for that one.   All in all, I'd be surprised if The Wolf Among Us is not among the ranks of my 'best of 2014' list when that day comes. A twisted, dark fairly tale mystery with immaculate visuals and superb voice acting, writing, and direction. Here's hoping we get a season 2.  4/5",

F; Sequel is coming one day so nice addition to have. PSP PC controller friendly Cons A: I am not sure if your choices matter or not. B: Very engaging despite the fact your not really risking bad moves in the game. C: Follow the game rating, some subject matter not suitable for children.  D: Could be a con like most films once you see it once, you may need time to go over it again.  OVERALL: Like all telltale adventures pretty straight forward storytelling with manuevers that can repeated if failed, so no real way to do so. Take alook at gameplay in Workshop. If Adventures are your thing. This is a must have and one of Telltales best.

It felt like Tarantino interpreted dusty old fables and rewrote them into a dark, modern conspiracy. About storytelling in general, Telltale does a great job beating around the bush as long as possible without losing players interest. Gameplay is like every adventure, four button choices in converstions and on-screen prompting in actionplay. I don't want to go into detail any more because this adventure does not really need a review (also I feel like my couch needs me ... ;D). Just play it. It's awesome!

The story takes place near modern day, and you assume the role of Sheriff Bigby Wolf, better known as the Big Bad Wolf. Yes, as in the one from folktales. In fact, the entire community that sorrounds you consist of fairly tale characters of whom rely on you as their peacekeeper. Whether or not that happends depend on you, and your choices as the sheriff.  It's narrative driven, almost 'on rails' if you will, but you can adjust the track to slight degrees.  9/10 - Buy it now, or not. It's your choice.",

There is added action and combat situations. These involve hitting WASD keys as they light up, overlapping a cursor circle over other circles on the screen, and tapping 'Q'. These are easy enough that they become more tedious than engaging.   If you want an interactive story this game is for you.

Like a normal Telltale Game, you have choices and these choices matter, so choose carefully. You can play as a good sheriff or the 'Big Bad Wolf'. As the chapter progresses, you meet more and more fables. You try to use your judgement and find out who the killer is. I would say more but these lips are sealed...

You pick the main character's dialogue choices and, occasionally, participate in quick time events. But the entire game is very scripted. So while you do get a great deal of roleplaying, the actual 'gameplay' is very shallow. That's not to say it isn't fun.  In fact, this is the first game that I have played just for relaxation in a long time. Most of the time I like being challenged, or I like achievement hunting, or beating that secret boss, or so on. This game rewards you just for playing, and the achievements work similarly. I got 100% achievements here not because it was a challenge, but because doing so meant experiencing more of the world, and I wanted to do that anyway. In a way, the achievements let the player know 'there's more here that you missed', and that was compelling.  It's like an interactive movie. It's worth playing, and you can get at least two solid playthroughs out of this, if not more. There are so many options that have so many different ramifications down the line that I still could go back and explore some more. Buy the game, you won't regret it.

Now clearly the plot twists wont have the same effect the second or third time around but seeing the changes in the game develop depending on your choices will see me playing this game again. Each chapter will take about 2 hours to finish and with 5 chapter this guarantees at least 10 hours of gameplay but the main reason to play this game is the phenomenal store arks. This is one of the most original and story rich games I have ever played (even for a telltale game). The story throughout the game had me guessing the twists and getting so many things wrong surprising me at every turn. Even if you see the plot twists coming (some you may, most you will not) it really doesn't impact on the story or how surprised you will be during it. The storytelling throughout this game is simply brilliant, you get so involved you will lose hours thinking only minutes have past, this game feels like it should be a netflix show that you can get really invested in. But without overselling it (too late) if you can push through the fact that is a telltale game (if you're not into that) i can definitely recommend this game.",

But of course, relationship to source material often isn't a major factor in what makes a game great. And I think Telltale's bespoke engine and particular graphical style are more suited to this release than any other I've seen to date. The comic book stylings, stark contrasts and (in this case, neon) tones really shine and seem to 'make sense' more in this game than any of their others.  It plays just like the other interactive Telltale adventures and the quality of writing and emotional impact is every bit as strong as what I've come to expect from them.  If you've enjoyed any other Telltale-style game and/or are up for a dark and gritty, constantly-engaging, urban fantasy tale, you should definitely pick this one up!!

You don't need to read the series to enjoy this game, but some of the little shoutouts to the series are very cool indeed. It was wonderful to see the business office again and Bufkin.  Gameplay is pretty basic, it's mostly interactive choices and a few fight scenes. If you are looking for a more traditional graphic adventure, look elsewhere. But don't let that put you off. This is great episodic content and very enjoyable. I hope they makre more like this because there are still things about teh Fables I want to know!",

So I went into this game without any prior knowledge about the lore. I loved its noir style, the story, and the main character as well as a few of the secondary/supporting roles carry the story really well. The game does a very good job in hooking you into the story and introducing to you in this world. This fantasy world right underneath our (human) noses.   It has an engaging storytelling, and the choices you make might not carry much complexity and endings as recent Telltale Games (i.e. TWD Season 2, Batman Telltale), BUT... it's not a game I don't mind revisiting regardless. So if you are looking to get lost in a mystery/detective story set in a world too small for fable characters not to collide... this is the game for you!  My only sorrow is that there wasn't a Season 2 for this game... Telltale Games, I love you but you broke my heart by not making a Season 2. Unless, there is one coming...",

A little alert might pop up to tell you something like:  &lt;!&gt;  You told the truth   &lt;!&gt;  You connected the evidence   &lt;!&gt;  Snow will remember that you took her side   Of course, a more honest alert might sound more like this:  &lt;i&gt;  Your decision has been carefully recorded for posterity and immediately flushed down the toilet   Nothing you decide in this game matters, which wouldn't be a huge deal except for the fact that decision making is the  sole game mechanic . It's tough to give players real choices because it requires a lot more content for the same amount of play time. Other games have run into this issue and some have found innovative solutions.  The Stanley Parable leaned right into it, making the very concept of player agency part of the story. Gone Home, a game in which literally everything that happened happened before the the protagonist even entered the narrative, built uncertainty and used environmental storytelling keep the player engaged. Wolf unfortunately has no tricks up its sleeve to balance its series of pointless 'choices.'  Maybe the biggest problem isn't that the choices aren't meaningful, it's that the game won't let you forget how meaningless they are for even one second. Between chapters it asks the player to sit through a recap of the previous chapter and a preview of the next, both of which serve as reminders of how linear and immutable the plot is. It's as if the game wants to constantly remind you about all of the events that are going to happen no matter what you do.  It doesn't help that the plot sometimes feels like an arbitrary string of red herrings and unconvincing fake-outs. We may see a character shot in the chest in one scene, only to to be told in the next that they're fine because of magic or whatever. In a fictional universe where the rules of magic are never totally spelled out, these kinds of  deus ex machina  moments are inevitable and they don't need to ruin the story, but too many of them in a row can make the stakes just seem very, very low.  It's kind of a bummer because there are some great things about the game. The voice acting is perfect and the writing faithfully recreates the weird, gritty fairytale world of the comics. The art is also pretty much dead-on in matching the comics while adding some dynamic elements, although some of the character movements push it into the uncanny valley. You can also expect to spend a few minutes on google trying to figure out how to fix the game's totally hideous lack of anti-aliasing (luckily it is fixable).   I marked this review, 'not recommended', but my thoughts on it are more mixed than that. I do intend to finish the game, I'm just disappointed.",

Having played and greatly appreciated 'The Walking Dead' 1 and 2, my experience with 'The Wolf Among Us' was disappointingly underwhelming.   The story.  My biggest complaint obviously, since this is an adventure game. Basically it's a murder story with unknown motive or means. It's not gripping, nor immersive. There's hardly any character development, no relationships development. The intrigue is really dull, gives little explanation and excitment. Introduces new meaningless characters all the time, and doesn't even wrap up properly, with any kind of finale or uncovering of the grand scheme. You stumble upon some facts and scraps of actions which in my opinion only serve the purpose to have another dumb quicktime-event section.  Your choices NEVER introduce any meaningful consequences, all the while you're being fed these info popups in the corner of the screen like 'Snow will remember that'. Yea, may bloody be, but the only implication of this will be a subtle 2-seconds-long smile she'll exchange with you some time later. Not only that, but these popups keep appearing  till the last 30 seconds of the game  leaving nothing but bitter disappointment when you hit the ending OF A BINARY CHOICE; yea you read that right, this game has an open, unexplained ending, followed by a screen sending you to a website with comics for sale, set in the Fables' universe, and guess what -- THERE'S NO SECOND SEASON. (I mean,  it's not like it would make anything better  ACTUALLY I'D HATE THESE PEOPLE.) I felt pain in the groin that moment.   I don't know guys, I'm so disappointed I don't know how to put it into words.

We didn't completely hate it, but we were extremely disappointed by the poor writing and the deviations in character behavior of characters from the graphic novels. Snow White in particular was poorly done, and she is one of the main characters of this story. On the other hand, we did enjoy what time was spent with Bufkin as he is one of my wife's favorite characters and was done reasonably well.  We have played other Telltale games and it is almost always the same - just enough goodness to keep you playing, but riddled with plotholes, inconsistencies in character behavior, a lack of options where it counts (did anyone else want to call a doctor for the man whose guts were sticking out rather choosing between murdering him or leaving him to die?), and in general just poor writing. The first episode was great, the second less so, the third involved a couple of moments where we looked at each other wondering what just happened, and by the end we were having a tough time caring about the characters or how it ended. The writing slid downhill _that_ bad.   My wife and I have also played both seasons of The Walking Dead along with Jurassic Park and a couple other Telltale games. We knew what we were getting into, we had hoped that with all the positive reviews it would be better. The first episode started out with such promise, we were hooked - but in the end, we will not be recommending this game to anyone, not even my wife's best friend who adores the Fables graphic novels.  If you love Fables, and are OK with drama rather than good writing, then you'll probably enjoy this game. Otherwise I recommend looking elsewhere, and probably not at another Telltale game.",

A women you save from your arch nemesis head shows up on your doorstep. this sets up out mystery, but the game steers away from this and turns into standerd telltale. The mystery begins to feel like an after thought. All evidance collected in a chapter is deleted when starting the next one. Then at the end of the game they just tell you who did it. Which makes this game feel more like an action trhiller than atmospheric mystery game.  You have minimal effect on the story, and only two scenarios where you effect the outcome. Scenario One is mostly choosing your side or snow white's side, or the side of the other person who is currently in the scene. Scenario two Is based on if you kill the bad guy or just arrest him.

The game is far more exciting, from my point of view, than The Walking Dead. It has a unique story and the entire 'detective' type of game play i got to take part in was simply fun.

The plot was a little simple for me (I was hoping for a lot more depth in the final 2 episodes) but I still found it enjoyable. However, this game pales in comparison to Telltale's The Walking Dead season 1 or 2 which unfortunately set the benchmark very high.  TLDR whole review:  Beautiful and atmospheric, with excellent character depth and voice acting which would have benefited from a far longer and more complex story arc.  Only really has replay value if you watch another player, which can be entertaining if they choose different game variables.  Negative overall because it was simply not worth the release price, with delays to episode releases and, quite simply, insufficient instalment / overall length.  Great if you can get it for under £15, otherwise you may feel rather out of pocket.  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Edit after release of Episode 3&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  As I really want to enjoy this game for a good solid few hours of immersion, I'll wait until Episode 4 is out and do a combined review of episodes 3 and 4 together. My fingers are well and truly crossed for greater episode longevity.  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Edit after Episode 2&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  Still beautiful, still deep and engaging, but PITIFULLY short and woeful value for money. Just look at people's game times. Episode 2 is even shorter than Episode 1 - I meandered through in only an hour and a half.  I really was expecting more considering the amount of time it took Telltale to release this installment.  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Original Review&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  This game is beautifully crafted; I thoroughly enjoyed the first episode and it will I'm sure be a pleasure to play through the remaining episodes.  However. I bought this game when it came out for at least £20 (I can't remember the initial price) and so far have only been given about 3 hours of content. I am hoping the future episodes will be longer, but frankly if the future episodes are also this length then I will feel pretty let down. 15 hours total for £20 is fairly OK for a normal game, I guess - not great, but not terrible - especially if the game is as fantastic as this one clearly is. But with a game that is also a staggered series like this one, I would actually be hoping for more content for my money, not less.  So I give it 9/10 for the game itself, because the concept and execution are both superb. But in terms of value for money (as it currently stands) it's a big let-down at 5 x 3 hours. My advice would be to wait until all 5 episodes are out and buy it and play through then, as your appetite will be better sated. This is how I tackled The Walking Dead's first five episodes and it felt absolutely fantastic (although I also felt that the chapters were longer in Walking Dead, which probably helped).  The best analogy I can think of is: at an exquisite restaurant, would you rather have 5 delicious starters spread out over a year, or one slap-up perfect 3 course meal in a year's time? For me the answer is definitely the latter, and I actually regret having the cut-off and the waiting for the next installments; but for some who can better handle the anticipation and aren't binge pleasure gluttons, you may find otherwise.",

Second thing that you need to remember is that Wolf Among Us lies to your face from the first second. At the start it tells you that the game is defined by player choices and advances based on them. As I already mentioned, this is not a game AND none of the choices offered have any lasting meaning. Don't get me wrong, the choices are made aplenty and they stay indeed - you even get to maul and murder a few characters if you like. But none of the choices mean anything to the greater story. Most of the choices don't even affect the outcome of the scene. Behind the facade of variety lies a rather linear game. Last thing you need to remember is that Wolf Among Us is incredibly short. An episode lasts around 45 minutes at best. So the whole season is around 4-4.5 hours of gameplay.  If you aren't bothered by these issues, Wolf Among Us offers a vivid setting of fables coping with modern world, decent story, familiar Telltale style and nice voice-acting. It's a quality product, but as any fable it charms the viewer with lies and deceit - smoke and mirrors as the second episode states - which leads to highly inflated scores and reviews.",

Regardless, I can't reccomend this one. It's both too short, and too non-interractive. It lacks the puzzles and involving plot of Back to the Future, and the reactivity and investment of the Walking Dead, plus is shorter than either. This is Telltale's weakest work to date, and with a large number of further games in the pipeline, I'm worried that one of my favouriate studioes have substituted quantity for quality.",

            "review_text": "Gameplay 4/10 Graphics 7/10 Story 7/10  I am guessing this game is one of Telltale Games' earlier works. The reason why I suggest this is because the player controls and gameplay are very low key. By that I mean if you bought the game and all 5 of it's episodes you are forced to deal with their reviews of the chapter before and a spoiler after you finish it without being able to skip it. Now the story was pretty good at least with the path that I took and I am not spoiling it but I will say that it feels short no matter which road you take. I got it on sale so I got it for a decent match to it's value but short game, short story and not so good gameplay all work together to me giving this review. It's not like it was garbage if you average my score out you still get a 6/10 which is pretty good.  I will say that even though it's a GRAPHIC NOVEL I still expect a bit MORE gameplay as it is a game. Things that would've been enjoyable would be: 1: Getting to play the detective role more. You do it once or twice but from there in you are mostly deducing, watching the story and responding to it, or fighting with awkward mechanics. [Which would be better after/during an investigation where you actually put things together. This does occur once during the game BUT ONLY ONCE.] 2. Being able to change your choices based off the input of your allies. This game tries to put you into the moment by forcing you to think fast but really it just takes the humanity out of it. You should not only be able to choose a response but also be able to to choose to change your mind at least partially IF there is time for it. 3. Being accused for things in the game that you didn't actually do. This will happen, it's annoying. 4. 'I can't go into details right now.' This excuse for not telling somebody what is going on shouldn't be used so many times in one story and should be used as a spice. 5. Repetitive choices in the same 1 minute of choice making. This isn't fun for a player or a person. 'Wanna break his jaw? Wanna break his boombox, Wanna break his Jukebox? Wanna break his cups? Wanna break his TV?' This isn't really a spoiler because it has no influence on the story AND YET IT HAPPENS WHY? 6. It's a dark story I get it, but I think in some places where blood was excessive there were other places were there wasn't enough. Drug placement was annoying too but I guess fables don't need to worry about CANCER or being alcoholic.  7.Brutal fighting, like a lot of it and in situations where all you want is to stop the person from punching your character it seems overkill.  Aside from these bits the story was good, and the art made the story tolerable even some of the more gorey parts. It is very easy to connect to all the characters and I feel like even when you make mistakes the game doesn't lord them over your head too much. These ratings even without any specific improvement on them [aside from graphics] would've gotten a higher rating if the game was longer.   I SHOULD be giving this a YES vote because as a Graphic novel it does it's job but because I bought it as a game lover and not as a person wanting a story I expected both gameplay and story from it. Take this more as a warning than a NO. To me as a game player this game has no replay value, is only good for light gaming and is not worth it's price at full cost.",

The game is rich with story, and the protagonist really carries the conflict which of course makes for a great interactive narrative.   This is my first forray into Tell Tale Games' unique story-telling, but the controls seem well-balanced and occasionally thrilling for a point-and-click.   The graphics are fitting, and the game is as well-directed a cinematic experience as I've encountered.   The English voice acting is mostly great, and my suspension of disbelief was maintained through the iffy bits by the other high points mentioned in this review.     THE REASON I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND",
