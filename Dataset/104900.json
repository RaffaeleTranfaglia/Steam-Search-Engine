If this game was priced at $10 I would say just buy anything else.  If this game was priced at $5 I would say you could buy lunch instead.  If this game was priced at $1 I would say you have no reason not to own this.  So what I'm saying is you have no reason not to own this. If you even get one hour of entertainment out of it from soley looking at some nice graphics and laughing at some bugs and glitches that was a dollar well spent. It beats the hell out of paying $70 for a AAA-title for the same effect. The devs know this is not the greatest game ever made, but they have made leaps and bounds in progress from the days when this was considered 'one of the worst games on Steam.' And for precisely this reason they have dropped the price so much. They want to redeem themselves. They want people to play their game and give it a chance. What are you waiting for, you heartless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥? It's only a dollar. Play their game.",

            "review_text": "Orion: Prelude is the revised version of Orion: Dino Horde, which itself, is a revised version of Orion: Dino Beatdown. Confusing, isn't it?  Orion: Dino Beatdown; the original, was a terrible game that launched as an alpha, with terrible netcode, and justly received a Metacritic rating of 36. Ironically, if you check the Metacritic rating, it'll be for Orion: Dino Horde. Apparently Metacritic hasn't received word from the developer that they've changed the name yet again.  But enough about how Spiral Game Studios keeps trying to reinvent the game by renaming it and patching problems that should have been fixed at release; what is the game like? Orion: Prelude is a team-based, cooperative, sci-fi, wave-based, FPS where your goal is to kill dinosaurs and complete objectives. The game is essentially what you'd get if you took Killing Floor and Halo and mixed them together. It's borrows Killing Floor's wave-based combat, where every kill gives you money to better arm yourself, and every wave gets progressively harder; and it borrows from Halo in the Shield mechanic, the vehicular combat, (although this could be atributable to other games as well) and the overall look of the game.  Up to five players can play together on a single server. Within the game, there are three classes which further distinguish your role from the role of the other four players. The classes are Assault, Support, and Recon. While I'd normally explain in depth the differences between these classes, I can't because there really isn't much of a reason. If you're playing this game, you're playing it in either Survival or Conquest. Sure, there are other gamemodes to choose from, but they're all variations of standard PvP gamemodes that exist in better incarnations in other games, so you'd be better served playing them there. If you bought this game, you bought it for the dinosaurs, which means it's Survival or Conquest for you. In that case, pick Assault if you want to kill things, and pick Support if you want to keep teammates alive. There's no reason to pick Rogue in these gamemodes. It seems as though the developers made it for PvP only, as in Survival and Conquest, it suffers greatly.  The differences between the classes really come down to the single class skill you get at spawn. The Assault class gets a jetpack ability which can be improved by purchasing augments. (more on this later) The Support class gets access to a medigun which can heal a player, and with the proper augment, replenish their ammo supply. The Rogue class can turn invisible which can act as an effective temporary invulnerability, as all Dinosaurs will immediately de-aggro from you and never attack you while stealthed. Those are the differences. There's also some weapon differences, but all weapons can be bought by purchasing an augment that allows you to purchase class restricted weapons.  What are these augments I keep referring to? Just like in Killing Floor, at the end of a wave which is usually around 20-30 dinosaurs, you have a minute to buy weapons or augments at their respective shops. Weapons are divided into four categories: primary weapons, secondary weapons, pistols, and Adrenaline weapons. Primary weapons are your standard rifles, LMG's, and Sniper Rifles. Secondary Weapons are SMG's and shotguns. Pistols are pistols, and Adrenaline weapons are class-specific weapons.  Augments provide boosts to your character's fighting ability; from double jumping to boost jumping, to additional armor. There's even an augment which allows you to feast upon dinosaur corpses for health which sounds neat, but is utterly worthless. While Augments are important, there's really a select few which are far and away better than the rest which you'll find yourself buying in the same order every game, irrespective of what class you are. There are a few class-specfic augments which I alluded to earlier, but most of the desired ones are shared amongst the classes.  Onto the dinosaurs. There are tiny dinosaurs like Compies, medium sized dinosaurs like Raptors and some larger spitting dinosaur, then there are large Dinosaurs like Triceratops, Stegosaurus, and of course, the T-Rex. Instead of being smart and making the large dinosaurs the primary objective of the game, the entire game focuses around killing the small dinosaurs, because the waves are determined by a specific number of dinosaurs that spawn, not the type of dinosaur. A dinosaur killed is a dinosaur killed no matter what type it is. So your best bet is to just kill all of the easy-to-kill dinosaurs, and leave the large ones alive to clean up after the wave has ended, assuming you don't have anything pressing to buy. This is the main gripe I have with the game. The main pull of the game, fighting giant dinosaurs, has been relegated to a mere distraction and nothing more. If you stop and spend time killing the large dinosaurs, you're opening yourself up to a whole lot more damage by the smaller raptors.  When I refer to the large dinosaurs as distractions, I really mean annoyances. They'll hone in on one particular player, then constantly harass that player until one of the two dies. The T-Rex is especially annoying because it has this weird snare effect when it's damaging you which prevents you from getting away from it, so you just get caught and repeatedly bitten until you go down.  When you lose all of your health, the game borrows the downed system from Left 4 Dead, where you can be helped up. I say they borrowed it because it seems to be a combination of the system from Left 4 Dead and Payday. Your character can fall three times. If it falls a fourth time, you're dead and can only respawn next wave. Killing a dinosaur while downed gives you a second wind, or you can be helped up by another player.  The graphics are shockingly mediocre. It seriously looks like Halo 2 on Xbox circa 2004. The Source Engine has never looked as dated as this in a long time. The character models are all low poly count, and the environments are all bland and uninspired. They are large, so there's plenty of blandness to go around.  Overall, Orion: Prelude is exactly what you'd expect it to be; a bland cooperative shooter which has no identity of its own. The developers apparently tried to ride off of the novelty of players fighting dinosaurs in a sci-fi setting, but the game requires more than that. On top of that, there's something rather deceptive about trying to hide your failure by re-releasing the game under a different name, as if to try and avoid that ugly metacritic rating.  The game is nothing more than Orion: Dino Beatdown, just patched to be a working copy of it, rather than a buggy, laggy mess that shouldn't have been released. All these complaints aside, the game will provide you with a few hours of entertainment before the repitition and realization that all of these gameplay choices have been pulled from more successfull games. Considering that at the time of this review, the game is being sold on Steam for $1, with a 4-pack of it costing a grand total of $3, I struggle to think of another Steam title which you can get several hours of entertainment for four people, for just $3. Perhaps in that regard, Orion: Dino Beatdown/Dino Horde/Prelude succeeds.",

            "review_text": "This game has made its way through my friends list like a sneaky case of cheap herpes. We all seem to have ended up with it somehow and now that we have it, we're stuck with it forever. Some of us were ashamed to have acquired it, so we thought we'd feel less lonely in our shame by giving it to someone else. Although the game is about as glamorous as herpes, it has turned out to be far more enjoyable. I won't defend the technical quality of the game (it is herpes after all), but I will defend its entertainment value. A survival co-op based on killing dinosaurs with cool guns and vehicles is just good fun. The gameplay is perfectly fine and lends itself well to many hours of pleasurable dino-slaying with a group of fellow herpes victims. The game even offers various ways of enjoying your herpes: several game modes that change things up and offer a good time even when you aren't in the mood for survival co-op. So the next time you see this on sale for a dollar, and think to yourself, 'I don't wanna join the destitute of Steam and engage in this nasty transmission of cheap fun,' remind yourself that you probably have some variant of herpes in real life, and you shouldn't be such a judgmental, pretentious, snob who can't put aside petty scruples in the name of good fun. Buy the game when its on sale (don't you dare pay full price for herpes), and come join us.",

            "review_text": "Over the years this game has been bashed as one of the worst games to be released on steam, however now I'd say get it.  For £0.79 game the graphics look like they are from a game costing £30, and the weather effects you get on your helmet is a nice addtion too, the main enemys in this game are dinosaurs and there are 7 of them and 2 flying reptiles and a giant Crocodile, all 10 of them feel unquie and fun to fight against.  You can get vechicles in this game, theres the average jeep with turret, a jet and a tank, but best of all theres a MECH! YES A MECH YOU CAN FIGHT A TREX WITH A MECH! All of the vechicles are great to drive and are really helpful overall.  Game breaking glitches like map glitches or crashes are very rare in this game, the only one I can think of is where you can leave a map by playing as a flying reptile or playing Assault with the jetpack and fly above the boundires, luckly this is only on one map and it's unplayed often.  However this game does have a few downsides....  1. A lot of weapon clipping, sound glitches and firing glitches, most noticeable with the default pistol, duo pistols and using reload speed upgrade. 2. Ragdolls are really glitchy at times, however more tame then any from the Source engine. 3. Playing as Dinosaurs is nearly impossible with the terrible camara angle and controls. 4. Soundtrack is really stock. 5. Small, but very friendly commuinty  Overall the game is much more better then it orignally was, a fun CO-OP horde game to play with your friends!",

Low res textures, game looks like late alpha/early beta.

Even setting everything out ot max makes you feel like all those blurs, blooms, dof effects are to cover how ugly this game actually is.  Graphics are not deciding here, let me move on with the review.  Gameplay is extremely boring and unsatysfying. Killing dinosaurs? That's cool. Well how about any progress, strategy, real objectives? All of that was replaced by run and fly tactic (also exploiting bugs and broken pathing of enemies), pretty much all the guns feel the same (like bb toys) and objectives are just to have a laugh at them every once in a while. Go the ♥♥♥♥ to the objective, stay there for 15 secs, get nothing but a vehicle so you can run back to the base asap. Wow, jesus!  Enemies? All the ♥♥♥♥ing same, slaying a t-rex doesn't give any satisfaction whatsoever but some slow-motion for 15 seconds straight so you can meditate on your miserable life, since you're still playing this game and wasting your time.  Audio is just crap. I think you can easily tell that by watching some gameplay video. I'm not going to ♥♥♥♥ around with onomathopeyas.  Btw. Watching the trailer again - haven't you noticed this actually trolling? Who would believe this is 'the most fantastic game' anyone ever played? It's not, unless it was this guy's first game. 'So cool I love it'? Now that's a cool quote. 'The metacritic score is misleading'? Of course it is, this game is 2/10 at best.  Look, getting this game for its current price is kinda a bargain.

They perks allow certain feats to be obtained, like jumping high, being able to heal machines (as a medic) and many many more.  Several different types of dinosaurs are present in this game, like pterodactyls, raptors, t-rex and spinosaurus. Depending on the round and which objective is present, certain dinos will spawn. These large giants are considered the bosses of the game, having very high health pools and insanely high damage.

            "review_text": "ORION Prelude is a charming enough FPS with dinosaurs that only costs $.99 right? Wrong! while this game has some good qualities to it, there are far too many bugs/ issues with it to even consider playing in a more consistent capacity, with there being far more capable FPS for free on steam. You would think with the 99 cent price tag that the game is worth a shot and your right. But when you get in game and notice that the game also has in game purchases for cosmetics and everything else, bugs and very unrefined yet basic system. You'll be wondering why you even payed the $1 in the first place. Luckily I was one of the thousands of people who got this game for free and thankfully that means that I got free trading cards for my time spent playing the game. before I get to the pros and cons of this game, I'd like to put some of the comments in retrospect from my experience.  This game has been compared to Halo, Borderlands, Killing floor, Jurassic park and a plethora of other AAA/ popular games.  To clarify things for the hyped up buyer. This game is as similar to those games combines as power puff girls is to street fighter. To put some things into terms this game retains a cap of roughly 300 players per day, while the original Halo on PC still caps out at 400 users daily. So if your looking for Halo. Then just go back to the original PC community as it is still alive my friend.  Sure this game has guns, but the shooting is generic and it's not realistic nor is it futuristic. The game can be played with the starting pistol and not challenge the user very much as he sits on a rock and kills all the boss dinos and everything in between. Even when I force myself to stay on the ground, the AI is poorly executed, even while on the hardest difficulties.  Pros and Cons.  Pros:  *The game is fairly cheap. *The community is not dead for now. *The developers may fix all the issues at some point. *The developers give away thousands of copies of the game monthly, so you can expect new and exciting users to keep playing with while the fun lasts. *The graphics are quite nice for the price *You get a cute little shooter for 99 cents  Cons: *Even on a high performance gaming computer, this game does not function well in full screen what so ever. *The game forces it to launch in full screen no matter how many time you toggle it to windows. *The clipping isn't rendered correctly on full screen *The audio is horrible and often drops/ cuts out from gun fire to dino roars. *The vehicle control is highly generic and most often comparable to Halo 1(That's a lie) The vehicle controls are far worse than the original halo games, or almost any early shooter for that mater. *Full controller support is true, although it's highly glitchy and the controls don't always seem to register when using a controller vs mouse and keyboard. *combat is often boring and tedious as the AI is one of the worse AI's I've seen in a FPS.   I could keep listing things wrong with the game but there is too many other games I could be playing during this time. I do hope that the developer takes the time to buckle down and release a good patch to fix most of the issues as the majority of them are common features in thousands of games that have way less funding/ following.   My advice is simple, if you want a fps with dinosaurs in it. Then buy a game that has mods for dinosaurs in it. Like Star Wars Battlefront II or Arma II. Cheers and happy gaming",

The metacritic is also another misleading score, it reflects the original games score, but the game has evolved quite a bit since then.   Why should you buy it? This game is for people that like games like Killing Floor that send the players against waves of enemies that keep getting stronger wave after wave, occasionally there will be a boss dino which will be quite the destruction machine. My own suggestion is to play this game with stranger and/or friends, since the singleplayer can feel a bit devoid of hummanity.",

Positives:    -There's nothing that compares to battling a T-Rex one-on-one with only a pistol and a medigun that can recharge yourself.  -Team-play is quite fun, too. The gameplay is simple enough that you can slaughter dinos without doing much thinking, which is exactly what it says on the tin.  -It is pretty stable, I didn't see any gamebreaking bugs and it works just as it's supposed to.  -The Killing Floor styled gameplay works really well with dinosaurs.  -The vehicles are varied and quite fun.   -The Adrenaline weapons are a nice touch.  -Do I really have to explain how fun it is to fight hordes of raptors while using a Jetpack? Steam, you should know this.  -None of the weapons felt 'Useless' in the sense that I could do decent damage with almost anything.   Negatives:  -The Support Class has VERY racist dialogue, I don't appreciate the fact that he calls his teammates 'Homies' and 'Dawg' just because he's of African decent. It's not even well-done voice acting so the point of including it at all is mediocre at best and it kind of detracts from the experience. Why couldn't they have race-neutral dialogue? I am kind of disappointed as it lessens the experience of an otherwise solid game.  -The price is way too high, however I bought it while it was on sale for only one dollar so I can't complain of this personally. If whoever is reading this doesn't own the game already, pick it up while it's on sale.  -There aren't many maps to choose from. It's not that big of an issue, but I could do with a change of scenery. To address this issue, allowing custom maps would be preferable.  -The game is very unbalanced, Supports are almost invincible if they have the Iron Pecs perk and the upgrades that make it so you can't die from heights or chomping. On the other hand Recon is nearly useless in all situations. However, this doesn't bug me very much considering I bought this game to casually slaughter lizards, not to engage the finer philosophical and strategic aspects of warfare in a futuristic society. The unbalance is entirely made up for by the fact there's a minigun.  Overview:  For a Unreal Mod, it has a high production quality, and it definitely deserves a higher metascore than it has in my honest opinion. It deserves at least a 65. If you wish to buy this game, do so while it's on sale, and have fun with it. It's not meant to be a realistic fighting simulator like Counter-Strike, so I don't see why people would complain of the unrealistic setting of a game where you're a space marine fighting dinosaurs on some alien planet. It lost it's realness at 'Dino Horde', and that's okay.   Games are just meant to be played, and I enjoyed every minute of playing this one.",

The trailer looks really amazing and all, i was really hype when i noticed the new content would be F2P this week but once i started playing i was really not happy.  INSTAGIB, was my first game, your gun take more then half the screen and it take like 2 sec to charge it to shoot, and you can't hold it and shoot at your will, it shoot after the charge.  Second game was in some kind of Power Generator defense map.. no idea what the ♥♥♥♥ was going on... killing dinos for credits and XP, bought a Magnum which aim like potato gun...  Again, this ♥♥♥♥ing gamemode.. follow a random dude... walk 3 km, like 10 min walk (THE MAP IS REALLY HUGE) don't see anyone or any dinos on the way... get seperate from that guy, meet 2 enemies... one of them already had a shotgun, we get really close to each others.. i shoot at him at least 50 times (i'm not an idiot i was totally aiming at him) and like 2 bullets it him for 24 dmg which is not even close to 5% health.. he shoot me 3 times at like 50 feets and i'm dead. I respawn and there's 3-4 guys in our base with vehicules murdering everyone.  The graphics are a mix of 80's games graphics mixed with CryEngine 2. Sounds is terribad... Map is huge for no reason... more ressources to load in your RAM for absolutely no reasons. Peoples won't explain you the game and tell you ♥♥♥♥ like 'I bet you play CoD', well at least CoD is a decent game, even the hitboxes are better in Black Ops then this game.  The fact i wasn't hitting anyone might be due to high ping servers but for me this game doesn't do it. I wouldn't even pay 50 cents for this.  Enough words. I don't recommend it.. if you like old school graphics game like Unreal Tournament 2004 but with some randoms ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ts CryEngine2-like and you like killing ♥♥♥♥♥ randomly for no reason to get own by RANDOM enemies. This might be your game..  ",

Like I said earlier, this is not BF4, or COD Ghosts, but for the money especially when this is on sale, you can't beat it.  *Update* System Specs have increased due to the new arctic update, you can no longer play this with dedicated graphics, you need some sort of GPU.

            "review_text": "TL;DR: It's fun, frequently updated and generally enjoyable, especially when played with friends. Wait for it to go on sale though, because the gameplay isn't worth the full price.  I was a bit scared when I picked up this title because of all the bad reviews it was receiving, stating that ORION: Dino Horde was one of the worst games ever made. After I watched a rather hilarious german gameplay video, and the game was on sale for less than 2€, I finally decided to get this game.  First of all, we've got to set the record straight: ORION: Dino Horde IS NOT the same game as ORION: Dino Beatdown. This should be a no-brainer, but unfortunately many people will still post bad reviews mistaking the previous Dino Beatdown for Dino Horde.  Dino Horde is a mutiplayer action game in which you have to kill off waves of dinosaurs and defend buildings. Between those waves, you're able to upgrade your loadout and perks by spending money which is earned in a TD-like fashion by killing enemies. The general concept is rather simple as is the gameplay. When fighting on foot, the gameplay consists of rather monotonous gunplay. Because the dinosaurs are generally faster than the player, movement and celever positioning don't really play a role in fighting. The only real variation lies in the different enemy types of which some require different strategies to kill. The game also includes vehicles and vehicle combat, which is a pleasant relief. The graphics are rather good considering this game is a low budget production, but the map design can be monotonous from time to time.  The strengths of the game lie within the co-op aspect and the frequently updated content. Since the launch of the title, the developers have included multiple new game modes, some of which deliver a rock-solid co-op experience, as well as other additional content.  This game isn't the next big multiplayer co-op shooter, but it definitely has it's moments and is generally enjoyable, especially when played with friends. The price of 13.99€ isn't worth the experience though. If this game goes on sale anytime soon, you might want to pick it up for some hours of multiplayer fun.",

But you know what? It's only ONE freaking dollar. And for that one dollar, you will get some of the rootinest, tootinest, dino-blasting fun ever seen in a video game.  There are only a handful of different game modes, most of which I honestly haven't tried. The tiny bit I've experienced of the PVP was terrible. Unfun, frustrating, and faaaaaar outclassed by pretty much every other multiplayer FPS ever made. But really, who plays this game for the PVP? It's all about those dinos, mayn. And wow, are the dinos fun.  The two game modes I play the most often, Conquest and Survival, pit you and of team of up to 5 other players/bots as you fight to defend your power generator from hordes of ravenous prehistoric monstrosities. There's no story. There's no explanation for why the herbivores and carnivores are working together and not eating each other. But, honestly, this game doesn't NEED a story. Just don't think too hard and shoot dinos. It's awesome.   The gunplay is quite smooth and incredibly satisfying. Blast a raptor's head with a shotgun and it freakin' EXPLODES, splattering bits of brain all over your stylish uniform. Drive a tank up to a T-rex's butt and fire a super-high powered explosive round directly into its crotch, obliterating it mere moments before it's about to devour your teammate. So awesome!   The best parts of this game are the moments you experience while playing, these little things that stick with you long after you turn off your computer. That time I leaped out of my helicopter to revive my fallen teammate, getting him to his feet and out of the way of a Spinosaurus before flying away and unleashing a barrage of missiles into its side. That time I used my flamethrower to keep an entire swarm of raptors away from the generator while my team respawned. That time I cleared an entire group of dinos using only a knife. It's these things that make you feel like an unstoppable lizard-slayin' hero.  TL;DR, this game has a lot of issues, but it's only one dollar and you could easily get at least 20 hours out of it at the minimum. Really, really good fun.  8/10    As a unrepentant dinosaur nerd, there are a few things I have problems with in this game's portrayal of its prehistoric creatures. First of all, they put two pterosaurs into the game, a rhamphorhynchus and a pteranodon. They called the rhamphorhynchus a rhamphorhyncus (which I have much respect for), but then they went and called the pteranodon a pterodactyl? What?? They also refer to them as dinosaurs, which they are not, they're actually flying reptiles that are barely related to dinosaurs. It also refers to a Deinosuchus as a dinosaur, and, well, its not a dino, just a big crocodile.  Its portrayal of the Dilophosaurus is more accurate than most other peoples, but the thing still spits acid. Guys. There is absolutely zero eveidence that in real life these things spit acid. STOP MAKING THEM SPIT ACID!  And that's it. Great game. Good game. Go play, now. Trust me, it's worth all 99 of the pennies you pay for it. ",

You could be shooting dinosaurs with energy lasers, or alternatively shooting players with energy lasers. Now, for most of the review there'll be content on Dinosurvival. This is because it's the main point of Prelude, but there are other games too. CTF is almost never played. If you want to play CTF, you might want to go somewhere else. Not saying CTF is bad on Prelude, just that nobody ever opens a server for it. You'll usually find the official servers are all Dinosurvival, with a few unofficial ones sportying different gamemodes, such as Gun Game or Team Deathmatch. I, myself, have never played TDM or Gun Game on Prelude, prefering the Dinosaur Shooting Madness known as Dinosurvival, in which you murder dinosaurs with Gatling Guns, Flamethrowing Turrets, and Helicopters.  Most of the time, the players are nice, friendly, and concentrated on the game. But once in about every 50 games, you'll get someone who hoards all the good vehicles without doing anything to help murder all dinosaurs you see. It's also very good for a cheap game, coming in at a CS:GO case key for 4 copies. (£1.69) Think of how much more content you and your friends are getting for your money when you bought a 4-Pack of this game instead of a case key for CS:GO. TLDR: A MURDER EVERYTHING game with a good playerbase and populated servers but some servers overlook gamemodes that probably would be good. 9.8/10",

I tend to stay away from the Player v Player game modes, as the co-op 'kill all the dinosaurs' is much more fun.

Unfortunately, I do have a couple problems with this game. Although there are 3 classes in the game, but I feel it is really neccessary to play the assault, due to the fact that dinos will quicky overwhelm you unless you can jetpack out. Walking around is not really a thing you can do, especially while being attacked from LITERALLY all direction. Also, vehicles can be overpowered (you can disable them though), and some of the gamemodes (that I have played), while fun, seem a bit lacking (too short usually). Some of these probelms may disappear with a larger group though (I've only played with 4), so keep that in mind  Overall, this is a really fun game though. If you think killing dinosaurs or flying around with jetpacks while killing dinosaurs is something you would like to do, then I would reccomend this game, especially if its on sale.  7.5/10",

I have logged over 500 hours in this game on a seperate account and bought it again for this one and all of my friends just to prove my loyalty to the product. Now for the actual review.  Orion: Prelude is an amazing game that can be easily compared to AAA titles such as Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, the Halo franchise, the Counter Strike titles, and is better than mostly all FPS indie titles out there.   Graphics: Oh my god the graphics. This is a timeless piece of art that will be revered for as long as video gaming is alive. The graphics are simply timeless and they make the enviroment look absolutely beautiful. Low graphics in this game are basically equivilent to Ultra graphics in Far Cry 4. Water reflections are amazingly vivid, the dinosaurs are textured amazingly. Really nothing else can be said but this is an absolute must have game for anybody who enjoys beautiful scenery and amazing gameplay.  AI: If you can call it AI... it feels like you're actually playing with real people when offline. The grunts that help you move and act like they were real war veterans and move into and out of cover as well as taking positions to give them the upper hand. Advanced manuevers are no problem for this AI. Aside from the humans, the dinosaurs are superb as well. Amazing tracking, great movement recognition. Be careful, these things can spot you from a mile away.  Gameplay: This gameplay is honestly some of the best I have ever experienced. The best way to describe it is a mix of Call of Duty, Halo, and the balance of Counter Strike. While in the game I have had extremely intense situations where the entire team relyed of me to win. Its stuff like that that makes the game fun. In one instance I was being charged by several velociraptors and a T-rex. I turned on my absolutely flawless cloaking device and fled the scene back to the hut where i bought my sniper rifle and killed each and every dinosaur to win the game. Lets say i was sweating after that intense experience and was extremely proud of my self and my abilities to master this amazing game.  Overall I think this is a must have for any video game player looking for an amazing, intense FPS situation with not only good graphics and fun gameplay, but with balance and a cheap price as well. Honestly, this game should be at LEAST 10$ for a copy. I have bought it for all of my friends and we currently all enjoy the game together and play it whenever we have a chance. Keep up the amazing work TREK and make sure you buy this game before the price goes up! It's definitely worth the money!",

There are still a few bugs and glitches here and there that occasionally mess with the game, but nothing gamebreaking from what I've seen. Mostly minor things that can easily be patched, and from the consistent support that the developers are providing for the game I suspect they quickly will be.  That said, THIS GAME IS SERIOUS FREAKING FUN.   Seriously, kudos to everyone who worked and continues to work on this game. It's nice to see a developer take enough pride in their game to maintain it and keep improving.  The dinosaurs are vicious, there's a nice spread of weapons to use, and teamwork is actually a legitimate factor in this game (unlike a lot of popular FPS games in the market now).   I can't remember the last game that let me jetpack around a hulking T-Rex to headshot it with my bow. Pure awesome.  The community is nice and helpful for the most part and there's always a variety of servers online with plenty of people playing.  The game is definitely still a bit rough, but, considering the mess that it was during release, I have high hopes that this game is just going to keep getting better as more updates come along.",

As for the graphics; they are so sharp and crisp I really believed I was sent back to 240p Jurrassic Era to slay Pixel mosters. The MMO elements work so well. You get all the satisfaction of playing WOW (staying a virgin for life, being fat and contemplating suicide) but it occurs even faster as the community is so polite. Honesty is the #1 Policy with these kind kiddos. They're all so honest as they're all 'banged my mum'.   The story is truely the most immersive experience since the holocaust. It's the most realistic story of any Pixel Dinosaur FPS Potato Teir PC Blockbuster in the history of this Klan.  The developers are a small team of PJ wearers from Tennessee. They have simple values, slaying blacks, white supremecy. The stuff us normies are too afraid to admit. They stand for whats right. AND OMG Their XMAS decorations are the best. They string up black folks on trees. So romantic. Regardless they're storming the white house soon to remove the ape who kidnapped Mr Bush. Y'all should join in. Unless y'alls some filthy ape lovers....

Survival Gameplay has 10 Waves of increasingly stronger Dinosaurs to fight, and your experience is more rewarding the longer you survive; dieing has the consequences of losing all upgrades, augments, and weapons you purchased during that life. This usually turns away or dissuades people who aren't good at surviving from continuing to play.  Multiplayer is difficult when playing with random people, but I blame that on practically nobody having a mic or speaking english. Communication itself is also practically nil, and most players (That I've encountered) will be more focused on rushing through the game, wasting resources and vehicles, and often dieing a lot in the process. To better enjoy a Survival match, I suggest getting some friends to play one with you.  The other gamemodes have very few players playing them, but that's due to the currently attempting-to-rise popularity of the game, and Survival is also the most commonly played mode.  If you're gonna get ORION, and/or play it, I suggest having a Microphone ready, a comprehensive grasp and understanding of the concept of 'Survival', good aim, better situational awareness, and some friends to play it with you (Who hopefully also have all the qualities described).  Try not to die!",

A friend of mine bought it for our group of friends because it was so cheap, little did we know that it would be damn good fun.   Classes, plenty of weapons, vehicles, upgrades, lots of modes, and dinosaurs. Though i admit the graphics aren't top notch but honestly not bad, lighting and shadows aren't bad, the dinos look sorta low res but who cares. And glitches galore but thats all part of the fun if you ask me.   The only downside i can see is that probably not many people host lobbies, not sure for certain. And that all the visual upgrades for characters is handled through a slew of microtransactions, but this game is only a dollar. Atleast its not like Rockstar's wonderfully overrated and squeezed for every last penny with microtransactions GTA 5.   AAA studios take note! This is genuine fun for the whole family.",

Honestly i have no idea where to begin with this horrible excuse for a 'game', so i'll start with the interface. I was greeted with screen prompts made for a 360 gamepad. I didn't even have a gampad plugged in mind you, apparently I am supposed to use a gamepad instead of my keyboard. Even if it was a port to PC, which it isn't, why would they use 360 controls as the button prompts?   Next, i tried to join a game; 4 times, each time unsucessful. It displayed a list of servers you can join, but may of them had a ping labeled as 'lobby' tell me, what exactly is 'lobby' ping? I finally gave up trying to join a server with people in it, and decided to join an empty one just to get into the bloody game. Hindsight being 20/20 i should have just shut the game down, and unistalled. It was free however, I was naive and wated to give this 'game' a chance. How very foolish of me.  Upon entering the match, the sound was bugged. I kept hearing a repeating sound of some sort of dinosaur trying to bite my head off every 10 seconds or so, even though no enemys were to found anywhere nearby. I had no idea what the objective of the gamemode was, but it displayed an enemy generator and friendly generator health bar, as for what the hell these generators did, I couldn't honestly tell you, but somehow my team's was down to 10%. I shot a couple pterodactyls and raptors; which I could barely see because it was on some winter level, and apparently my character didnt have the ability to wipe this all consuming frost from covering his entire visor. Seriously, it was like someone took a jar of vasaline to my characters face and went 'off you go! time to kill some dinosaurs, i think!' Very shortly after, the game crashed, which was the best part of the game in my experince, BECAUSE IT WAS OVER.   Honestly, just 30 minutes of this game gave me a headache, and im pretty sure if i kept playing i would have had a brain aneurysm. Do i reccommend this game? That is a hearty and concise NO. I don't care wether or not this game is in alpha, beta, or what have you. If you are going to allow people to play it, make sure it is actually playable. ",

The value this game has at 99 cents is very high in my opinion, with a decent variety of multiplayer modes, weapons, maps, enemies, vehicles, and more. The addition of AI teammates is a plus as I enjoy playing offline shooters. The scenery in the game is very well designed. Its not the most technically sound shooter I have ever played and it is not quite the kind of game that I could sink a large amount of hours into, but anyone who nitpicks a 99 cent game too much is taking things way too seriously in my book. I genuinely believe this game is better than some FPS games that I have paid $60 for in the past.",

            "review_text": "This game has great potential; I've never though of a dinosaur based survival game. On the other hand, there are some things that need tiny tweaks and major improvements. First of all, I'll be talking about things that need to drastically be changed.  1. The AI for the dinosaurs need some changes. All that the ground dinosaurs do is, if you're on the ground, bolt after you with no strategy and try to eat you. If you're somewhere they can't reach you, they'll either start randomly running around not knowing which path to take to get to you, or they'll go and destroy the generator. Also, if you shoot a dinosaur it does not affect its movement; it will keep in charging at you until you finally kill it. 2. Very frequently I've been kicked out of a match for no reason. The game doesn't tell me why I've been kicked which is a major drawback. Those are two things that need major improvements on. Now I will list things that could slightly be improved on. 1. Animations for dinosaurs could be made more natural. Going along with the first thing I listed, If you shoot a dinosaur, they could flinch and/or stagger a little before continuing on with what they were doing. 2. Animations for the player have been a little buggy for me. If I reload my weapon, sometimes the magazine will fly into its place before the hand can move the mag into its place. If I equip a pistol, the pistol will be in its ready position without my hands and then my hands will come to hold the pistol. I think all of these things should be changed, and I hope the developer of this game sees this and takes action. I've heard this game has made improvements, but once these are changed, I will be able to recommend this game.",

This game is built on team wok, so it is going to be based on what people you play with either you going to have a lots of gunblazing fun or running back and forth fixing your generator while being munched on by some compy, because other players have left to do whatever. Beside that, the only other thing that can spoil your play time is an occasional lag (hopefully they have fixed that since the last time I have played).

I get such a rush too, there's nothing like gunning down a charging T-Rex and there's nothing cooler then having the game shift into bullet time when you take down one of the big boys.  Furthermore the extra modes are just as mun, pvp dules, rampage, conquest (don't get me started on conquest).  The only downside I find is the lack of diversity with the builds. It's not horrible but having three classes where their only differences are their abilities (Jetpack, Heal gun, and Stealth) does take away from some team elements that could be there.

The learning curb is pretty small if you've been introduced to games like this before. Just kill everything and upgrade as much as possible. It can be somewhat easy once you know what you're doing and can kite a bit. Making it into late game can be very satisfying because there's so many smaller dinos and several bigger ones running around all trying to get you and you can single-handedly take them all out if you're a good enough pilot. The clash of futuristic weapons and armor with ancient extinct reptiles is nice. The mode I've been playing is survival, basically Killing Floor with bigger maps, vehicles, and upgrades. There's many more modes to try out though. If anything I'd say it's a least worth trying out. It's also pretty cheap so that's nice too. Of course there are some bad things about this as well. The good outweighs the bad, but still. One of the biggest things I've noticed is that the skies usually aren't that great compared to the landscape. Could just be a texture bug, but I dunno. If anything they're just boring. Another big problem is getting stuck in rocky places of the map. Can be very problematic if you're trying to get an object last minute.

That was because of the price. But I was truly wrong.  So first pro; Price. The game is very cheap. Next pro is the combat. You can fight (obviously, DUH) dinosaurs or players in the game with futuristic weapons, like various guns, melee weapons, turrets, and grenades. You can roll to avoid attacks. The combat is fast kind of like today's DOOM 4. Next pro is gonna be the shop. Get some credits and get spending on skins for your armor, weapons, swords (for their color or beam), and dinosaurs. Get new taunts and fancy capes, too. Now a cool feature that I like is the vehicles. You get a wide variety of vehicles from your standard car but with a machinegun, helicopters, tanks, even a robotic thing straight out of CoD AW. So that'll be it. Sad part is just the fact that there are still some annoying bugs since 2012, but I can ignore them. Normally THOSE bugs are, glitching inside big dinos, which is annoying.",

I bought Dino Horde because it was cheap, played a little, and clearly saw the flaws right away : Missing animations, general slowness for no reasons, dumb menus, dumb map design. Apparently though, so many reviews of people begging players to give the game another chance because it was much better now than it used to be. So I downloaded it again...   First game : I load a map, I shoot, the gun is immobile. The hands/arms animate, but not the gun... Fine, it must be because the game isn't started, right? I need to find a generator, maybe it will animate after? I find a generator, walking very slowly because everything is sluggish, the game start, the gun still doesn't animate, but now it doesn't animate while a dinosaur is seemingly stuck in a circle in front of me.  Maybe the map didn't load right? I exit the game, start a new one, choose a new map... It's the *same map* as before, but with pumpkins, cell shading and a laughter track added. I play around a little, I die, next map loads. They ask me to choose my class, I don't, I press escape, I am brought to a Spectate other players screen. Weird, it was a solo game. I press escape, I am brought to the main menu, but the map is clearly still loaded in the background.  So in 5 minutes I am faced with the same issues as with Dino Horde : Missing animations, general slowness for no reasons, dumb menus, dumb map design.   Why are reviews saying that this game changed for the better? It did not. Adding cel shading to a map doesn't make a game better. The player's animation and movements are all ♥♥♥♥ed up. When we jump and touch ground, we get a foot smaller and then pop back to full height. Guns don't animate. Gun's impact particles are oriented with the walls, not with where bullets come from  I have a download cap when I live, no ISP offer unlimited bundles, and yet I re-downloaded it based on all the 'This Game Got Better' posts. I feel like I was robbed of my bytes here. This game is *not* better than it was. I'm deleting this game and I will *not* fall in the Orion trap a 3rd time.",

Granted, my frame rate issues didn't help much at all...but either way, my interest in the game quickly faded after about...maybe half an hour into my first match. Sure, I love the fact that it's basically a zombie horde game but with dinosaurs, but...it was just far too repetitive to keep my interest for long. The dinosaurs were...in all honesty, they don't have great AI. Sure, they're good at surrounding you and tearing you to pieces; sure, they're good at charging you and running you through; sure, they're good at taking you out before you have time to react...but their attacks were far too predicatable and you could easily skirt them without receiveing any damage. The weapons were a bit...iffy, in my opinion. The pistols just sound like the automatic rifles, just in single bursts. Oh, and don't get me started on the fact that some of the sound effects for two or three particular weapons are taken straight out of Command and Conquer: Red Alert 2. I'll likely go on a tangent about that. But the rifles just felt...unbalanced to me. It was far too easy to get kills with them since they have next to no recoil from what I was able to see through my low frames. And the accuracy wasn't all that great, IMO. The last thing that really irked me was the fact that objectives were so damn far away from the bases. I mean, 500 meters is fine and dandy, but 1000 meters away from the main base? And you have to get there before dino's overrun the objective. What annoyed me was that you find out about the objective right at the start of a wave, so you have about 3-4 minutes of running to do in order to get to the objective while dino's are spawning already halfway to the objective and overruning it. You have no time to get to the objective before the raptors and ptera's are all over it. Granted, my frame rate issues were a large factor in me not enjoying my time playing the game. But I couldn't fix it for the life of me. But regardless, it was about fun for the first five minutes while I was fighting off raptors and compy's on my first wave. I mean, let's face it, anything with dinosaurs in it is going to be fun. I can overlook most of what I stated above simply because I can understand just how this game might be entertaining for the majority of players. But for me...there's no fun in repetition. For meticulous players like myself, I would not recommend this game However, if you're one to not be bothered by what I stated above, then this is a $0.99 game worth getting if you're simply looking for a fun time blowing the heads off of raptors. In that case, I would recommend this game to those players.",

The gfx/sfx are oddly bad in some places while decent in other places. Enemy models will often chaotically twitch for a moment, making it hard to aim where you want to, not to mention I saw every single raptor who got close to me from the inside because the camera was inside the model, something that shouldn't really happen.  Overall the game feels horribly unpolished and lacking any real substance. Then again it's dirt cheap and not downright terrible so I imagine it can offer some fun for good money if you find it more entertaining than I did.

Purchasing this game was nearly a no-brainer, the only problem I encountered was giving up 1/10 of my hourly wage from McDonalds to pay for a game. But hey, for some childhood nostalgia, it had to be worth it. I couldn't be more wrong. This game wanted me to kill the ones I loved. My enthusiasm for these creatures was one of endearment, and Orion: Prelude was telling me to hurt the animal I idolized. How could I agree? After completing a round of this mindless horde against cute little raptors and a righteous Tricerotops, I had enough. I immediately quit the game, and spent the rest of my Friday evening crying to myself about how the world is so morally evil, like most Friday nights... well most nights in general. But thats besides the point. This game attempted to ruin my zeal toward dinosaurs, and I couldn't take such a harsh hit to my life.

So I had to make a choice to rather get food for my family, or play as motherfckin dinosaurs and let my family play a couple times. So I decided to buy Orion Dino Horde. At first I was like, holy fricken jesus look at the small dinosaurs that just horde the generator, screw orion dino horde, it should be dinosaurs like to orion the generator with a horde. While I play, I let my friend Anne Frank play for a while, she said 'lulz i gve it 0/7, bt il be bck, im goin to gt baked' so i assumed she ment going to the sauna because that game was amazingly optimized but instead she climbed in the oven and left me a note saying 'lulz, il nver be an mlg orion dino horde player lik u'. I said aw, you really think im that good? Of course she didn't respond because the game was sooo good it made her kill herself. So then I thought, if im really that good, ill need other people to tell me that. So I got a buddy of mine named Lorenzo who was healthy and young. After he was done he said 'lulz hld on polp, i ned to seee mi parnts bcuse lulz' I was so confused so I waited and a week later I go to his house and hes all 'U DID DIS TOO ME' and I ran and talked to Lorenzos dad and he said, 'lulz dat fagot got ALD from somedinhg clled Dino Beatdown'. I got really scared and left. 2 years later i go back to his house and he is now hooked to a respirator and a suculant incubator. Thats when I realized something, that game gave him ALD. So I let him play it one more time for good old times and he said '.-.. ..- .-.. --.. / ..-. .- --. --- - / ---.. -..-. ---..' thats in morse code, so that means 'lulz fagot 8/8'. I really couldn't believe how Mlg I was at this game. But then that made me think, one person who played this game killed herself, and the other onee got ALD from it and only enjoyed it when he was paralyzed, blind, deaf, and could only move his hands. So finally, my review on this game is that you rather have to be MLG like me John Motherphockin Sorcerer Polp, or you die and get ALD from it. It was worth buying this game then giving my family food. Lulz i give this game 1/8, would not get noscoped by dinosaurs again.",

Buy this on a sale, not for full price.  ==============EDIT 4/1/15============== They fixed the annoying enemies (birds are still annoying when in the helicopter, but that's understandable), and generally made the game much better! They give you $20 of credit to customize your character at the start, which is great. The game looks and feels much better since I've last played it.

Bad. Do not buy.  Killing Floor is a hordemode shooter that focuses on one thing and does it damn well- only objective is to shoot well-designed enemies with well-designed weapons, and the sounds, music and feel are all tehre to make that fun. Weapons are powerful and feel powerful yet balanced between eachother, enemies are dangerous yet 'fair' and react to shots.  ORION DINO HORDE however, does the exact opposite: it give a player tons of guns and vehicles and makes all of them very bland. it gives billion game modes out of which 1 or 2 are worth playing and rest are dinosaur carp. Enemies feel plastic, hitboxes are wonky and movement is hideous. all animations are f-grade be it enemy, friendly or vehicle. The entire sound design is hideous: the loudest weapon in game are dual pistols, which deafen out tank gun and dual gatlings 100 to 1. weapons are laughably underpowered and imbalanced, only this enemies do is rush you like kamikaze planes.  Most of the flaws in the game are obvious to anyone who stops to sit for 5 seconds on 'what should good gameplay include', but Spiral is content on pumping out 'more is better' without a single thought on quality of the game.",

Cons: -All the guns feel the same -So do all the dinos -Not exactly understanding why my controler will randomly stop responding, but ok. -When you buy one thing from the shop, you get another. Verdict: Overall, if you want a fun game about shooting smartISH dinosaurs, with futuristic guns and jetpacks, this is your game, while I didn't get to play coop, I would probably reccomend playing though it with friends, and not random internet ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.  Best of luck to the developers, Luigifan.",

Fighting dinosaurs is funny one time. 5 sci-fi soldiers per map against waves of A.I controled dinos. Between waves , you have to purchase gear, each kill give you cash you can spend in your base (starting point). But devs didnt though i would be nice to bring the 2 damm buildings needed to buy weapons and upgrades close each other... Indeed when you have 50 secs after each waves, you loose nearly 20 secs to reach thoses two buildings... annoying.  Some weapons are nice, but others are just useless, in general weapons doesn't have this 'feeling' of power you can have in most shooters.   Vehicles are dispached on the map, the interresting thing is the ability of support class (3 classes at the end) to repair vehicles. The unlimited amount of vehicles wich is quite annoying in games today was replaced here by the need to spare them. Good idea ! The problem is that vehicles are horrible to handle. One guy told me 'this is halo's driving style'. Here this is worst ! You will scream against dinos who will knock back your vehicle especially the mech wich is a scam. Vehicles weapons overheat. The Hud overheat indicator is not appropirate and will stuck you many times during battles.  For foot fighting; you will hate this game when a big dino will chase you and, in an act of courage, you will take him down by yourself and die like a ♥♥♥♥ because one minor dino blocked you on the way of your retreat. Because you can't go trough them. In this game, movements are not realistics like third person view where your torso is stuck as if you had a rake in the ... hum... you got the idea.  But he most annoying: crashes. For many years i never had a game such impossible to stop ! After 100 mins of playing the game crashed. It it was just impossible to stop the executable ! Amazing... especially when you succeed by closing your session, again you launch the game and... nothing. The game launched apparently steam recognize it but... nothing. No executable, no icon, nothing.  When you enter the game you see a banner where devs are planning to launch a kickstarter for a new game with AGAIN sci-fi soldiers vs dinos BUT this time in an open world. Hey Devs ! If you wanted some cash for your kickstarter you got 1 buck but you won't get anything else from me !  Note they dared to add some kind of item shop in the game (with their scandalous promoting vids !) . I didn't really browse it but francly they've boasted a bit too much of their game to think people will buy more than this title.  If you wan't to slaughter dinos (and humans) go on primal carnage wich much more interresting.",

The devs made promises (like fixing the technical issues, which is why I even played for more than 4 hours) which they either decided not to or never intended to keep, quickly turning this game (which has gone through 3 not very major iterations) into abandonware shortly after the prelude 'content' update.

Although I am not playing on a gaming PC, this could run Farming Simulator 15 (Not in my library I have it on disc) at a stable 40 FPS on medium graphics, Arkham asylum at 50 FPS on medium, PS2 at 20 FPS on low, and PVZ Garden warfare (Yes, I use origin as well as steam, hate if you will) at 30 on medium.

My friend, who does have a custom built gaming PC that can run PS2 on ultra high at 200 FPS, said that the game was easily broken (A ton of glitching dinosaurs) and the vehicles were too OP.   I'm sure it can be fun... but it does not work well. 2/10.",

It isnt good, yes its a dollar but tbh its better off using that dollar to go buy a Mc Chicken from Mcdonalds or something.  The servers are laggy and the game isnt optimized great. Oh and there are microtransactions in the game as well so theres that and if i recall there is a helmet that is basically Boba Fett from starwars....Oh and the new activision DMCA which is legit on Activisions part. The game once upon a time had promise but now its just not even worth the Dollar. I think when i originally got the game it was more than a dollar as well so ♥♥♥♥ to that.

It's only that this time around the developers said 'Hey, we made the game, let's like, fix it and stuff.' Then they did. Then they added billions of loads worth of content. So much so they renamed the game about 2 (or 3) times based on how much they updated.  There are tons of maps, modes, weapons, and just variety in general that should make this game a jurassic cluster♥♥♥♥ of nonsensical fun. Why 'should' ? Because beyond all of what they have added, all of what they have continued to put into the game, I canno't for the life of me enjoy it.  Why? Well it's probably gonna seem stupid, but I personally think it makes a big difference.  Every single weapon is simply not enjoyable to use and makes the game feel boring and bleak.  Everything feels like a pop gun with the volume put to 2. I swear to god that sometimes the guns make literally no noise at all. They designed these huge awesome looking assortments of weapons, but they all feel so static and weak it's a joke, and aside from that there is very little feeling of actual impact when shooting anything.  This is seriously a big problem that hinders the entire game unenjoyable, or at least for me. I mean come on, this is supposed to be a giant battle for survival against huge, glorious dinosaurs, but there is nothing-- NOTHING about doing anything in this game that's at all fun to do.  This should be so easy to fix, and I hope to christ they make an update to the game that completly reworks weapon animations, sounds, and effects, because as of now it's loads more satisfying to fling rubber bands at a picture of Jeff Goldblum.  Also the occasional heavy lag and frame drops don't exactly help out.   Is the game worth a doller? Well to you and some others it might be, but there is nothing here that can bring me back unless they just update the guns to make them feel like actual, powerful guns.",

            "review_text": "This game, with the right group of friends, provides an amazing return on enjoyment for the cost. It brings back memories of playing Halo 2 co-op on XBox with it's graphics and gameplay, but also the enjoyment and replayability of L4D2. I can play the same maps over and over with friends and always have a different game.  One day I'll get trampled by a Triceratops, but kill it with one hit point left with my pistol, ala Saving Private Ryan. The next day I'll take to the skies in a helicopter and save my medic-playing friend from the hoard of raptors she had missed while fixing the generator. The day after that, I'll track a nasty pteranodon carefully with my sniper rifle and line up an expert shot, only to be picked up by a completely different one, dropped in the middle of the fight, and quickly eaten by a Spinosaurus.  The game's difficulty is easy to control. If you're looking to relax, pop it on Easy and add some ambient dinos in a Conquest map, and spend two whole campaigns blasting T-Rex's with a tank. Or if you want a challange, throw it on Expert and dive into a King of the Hill map with equally skilled opponents. The maps are wide, beautiful, and varied, and there's plenty of details to catch every time you play. There's something to be said about mowing down rapters in the middle of an arctic wasteland only to have your visor freeze up with ice. There's something to be said about wondering where the hell you're taking damage from in a huge rain storm until you finally clue in and punch that nasty ankle-biter to death.  The game is glitchy at times. Some days it wouldn't let me join or host multiplayer maps, and that issue resolved itself without me figuring out why. Changing game settings while the game is active will crash it entirely. However, I've yet to have a single issue once I've actually gotten into a game and just kept playing. I would heavily recommend this game to any group of friends who are looking for a way to casually stay up until 4 in the morning, accidentally. That fun. That well made.",

I mean the feeling i get, jumping straight into this game, with absolutely NO campaign dialogue, 0 tutorial, and no story as to WHY these dinos are assaulting me is just the utter lack of 'Wheres the bloody plot?'  So Gameplay wise, the controls are very hectic, starting off with what feels like a cursor movement of 10/10 setting i feel like my first few seconds id snap the neck of my avatar if it were a real person. After getting used to the controls, it feels and reacts very naturally, like any common shooter would. Controls follow the typical Forward back, left right, crouch and shoot functions. I like the addition of the shortcut commands, and that helps in a pinch instead of typing out the messages individually and having the text pop up on the screen.  Graphics.... uhm... The dinosaurs are very blurry, the movements are very sketched together, and the overall texturing of the avatars is very blurry. The landscape however is beautiful! Especially tying in the natural sun glare with staring up at the sun, the rain and drops on your visor/hud are very wonderful effects. The fog and the steam also is a very well designed mechanic. Just overall landscape wise is beautiful.  Sounds. It seriously sounds like some of the audio is played by the Halo announcer himself. Enough said.  Overall, I played this game for about 20 minutes of my evening, and first reaction it has alot of potential. This is definately a game that could do something but in the Multiplayer state it is, it feels too narrow. There are already too many GREAT and AWESOME FPS games that incorperate a wonderful and seamless Campaign or backstory, that this game would easily fall into obscurity for sheer lack of the ability for it to overcome that knowledge. The Lack of the story and the utter confusion just being dropped into the bunker that first time is very unsettling to a gamer who is used to having at least a little bit of a 'this is the universe' kind of opener.",

The sandbox maps, although sometimes looking a bit too empty, still allow the game to happen at different sites and hide very useful things within travel distance. The gameplay grows in difficulty as the waves go up and there'll be a point you'll be viciously fighting for your life - running for a triceratops, most likely. The choice of guns and augments is pretty decent, allowing for very different playstyles each time and making the fight against the dinos easier. The revolver pistol is a must for those who are starting a new game and want to give the dinos hell.  The downsides of the game, however, are those referring to the optimization, which I mentioned earlier. It'd be very good for me - and for many people, I suppose - if the devs keep up that great work of theirs and made the game smoother somehow, for the 17 to 10 fps drops really tends to break the immersion and overall get us killed. Another thing I'd be happy to see would be an option to choose driving commands, between mouse and WASD (though I honestly don't know if I haven't missed it myself while navigating through the menus).  tl;dr: So, you there. Reading this review and all. Thinking about buying a can of Monster Energy drink? First you buy a 4-pack of this game so you can have fun with your buddies.

In the first 10 minutes of gameplay, I lagged through closed doors, picked up overpowered machine pistols with no recoil and infinite ammo, walked through about three dinosaurs, witnessed dinosaurs coming out of the floor, saw a dinosaur run into a rock face multiple times for no apparent reason, got killed in a car that exploded for no reason, got sent 2000 meters across the map by that explosion, and respawned there, which forced me to jog all the way back. I could say that was one of the best 10 minutes of new game gameplay ever. Definitely 10/10 for all the ridiculously entertaining glitches, random slo-mo, random lag, crazy vehicles, ridiculously overpowered weapons, and stupid dinosaur AI's. PEACE.",

The smaller dinosaurs behaved like the pink demons from Doom and the large dinosaurs went down fast, seemed incapable of threatening the players and in general failed to express proper giant monster mannerisms.

It gives basic blips but you can't tell what type of Dino you are facing, for all you know a TRex is behind you and it 1 shots you while you're punching a Raptor in the face like a boss. Weapons do seem to be a little off also, you might as well not ADTS as its a waste of time for anything other than a sniper rifle. I do like this classic shooter style but if a weapon feels more inaccurate when ADTS then there are some issues with it. However the weapons are pretty cool, definitely futuristic though some of their animations could be improved upon.  However, if you are looking for a decent time killer to play with friends this is what you want. It seems a little more like a Beta and I wouldn't pay any more than the $15 they are charging for this game (as of this review it is on sale for 99cents whoop whoop).

You don't use loadouts like in COD it's more similar to Counter Strike where you buy weapons at the begining of each round. I haven't played much but after playing the free week trial (limited time only) I decided to buy the game since it was on sale. I would like to make a note that I am reccomending it at the sale price of 1$ or 15$ if you have disposable income. If you don't have much money to spend on games I would wait for a sale or just skip it if you're not obsessed with dinosaurs like I am. The game is still in development and started on kickstarter. I don't think it deserves the 36 it got on Metacritic. I feel like most reviewers were overly critical although maybe I'm just biased.

I couldn't recommend this game to a friend for anything more than $5-$7 dollars as it still feels like the game was only partially fleshed out. In saying that, the concept is great, the combat has a nice flow, the first few fights with large dinosaurs are exciting, however it becomes very limited in the dinosaur diversity after a while.   Although I've read into the criticisms against ORION, I believe that my enjoyability in the game isn't based of the designers themselves but instead based off the product that they push out. I hope the developers take a positive approach to the gaming communities reaction and produce a game that I could safely recommend to fellow gamers and know they would enjoy it as much as I have.",

            "review_text": "Vastly improved since release, originally titled ORION: Dino Beatdown. Don't let the Metacritic score fool you, this game is now a shadow of it's former terrible self. The constant updates and bugfixes have transformed this game from being a very bland and broken basic shooter, to a very fun co-op survival game. The amount of equipment, customization, and vehicles; combined with many months of simplifiing the games UI, game mechanics, and constant bug fixes make the entire package a very fun way to play.  The sheer scale of battles, and the fast-paced combat make it fun. If you get a bunch of friends in on it, you'll be coordinating air strikes, tank movement, and infantry battles all in one wave. It's really something just to see two VTOL's fly above you and reign down missle fire, as two tanks flank from both sides... with troops pouring from either side, engaging a T-Rex which is more then enough to take out everything around it.  The AI has been vastly improved, as well. When the game first came out, you would have raptors blindly rush you in a straight line... and pterodactyls swooping in predictiable patterns. Now, the enemies juke and run around, the pterodactyls are hard to shoot and become the bane of any VTOL pilot. Granted, don't expect any amazing AI here, it's still a horde game and horde AI still crowns... but the game is challanging, even if you have the credits and augments to last. Underestimate a triceritops, and it'll destroy your tank in two hits with its charge attack.  In fact, the best way to describe the feeling while playing this game is like living the movie 'Avatar', but instead of Navi... you have face-ripping dinosaurs.  The game has vastly improved on bug fixes, graphics, and optimization since it came out, as well. No longer do you have memory leaks crashing your game, or textures failing to load. No longer does the game lag on high-end systems, and the graphics looking akin to a grainy mess on your screen, hidden by lens flare. The style, while still basic, has been vastly improved; comparable to the style of Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon. Lots of high bloom space colors, lasers, and heavy weaponary... with vechicles that look as much retro as they do futuristic; this game feels right at home... combining a 'Rad' vibe, high-tech space, and a cheesy 'B' movie feeling. The environments are lush, and the maps are large and immersive. A day-time/night-time cycle affects your visibilty and shifts your gameplay. For example, while playing on a tundra map the cold air at night will cause your visor to freeze if you stay outside in the dark for too long, requiring you to find someplace warm. Rainstorms and snowstorms can also hamper your vision, giving the dinos a leg up to ambushes.  The games three classes (assault, support, and infiltrator) have gotten a major upgrade since launch. No longer is the medic gun useless on the support toon... and no longer does the assault dominate maps. The classes seem very balanced, having their own weapons and play styles. An augment system is also in place, which allows you to purchase in-game upgrades with in-game credits you earn per round... allowing you to gain class specific upgrades like double jetpack energy for the assault, or that the support's medic gun can heal structures and vechicles. Later augments will even allow you to purchase and use other class specific weapons, like being a 'boost-sniper' assault... or being a cloaked minigun assassin; as well as having the ability to canabalize raptors for health, earn more credits, or even cause the enemy who kills you to die as well. However, augments arn't permanent... and during rounds you have a finite amount of lives. Not only does dying during a wave cost you a life, but you loose all your augments that you've purchased; giving a larger penalty to death then most games do.  This game has the standard assortament of game modes like deathmatch, team deathmatch, king of the hill; along with having duel modes for both 1v1 and team. The standard horde mode exists as well, called 'survival'... but the meat and potatoes of this game is in it's conquest system, which will allow you to experience those large battles that you see on the screenshots. Players have to fight through waves of enemies, generating credits and protecting their power generator, then use those credits for upgrade, equipment, and vehicles. There's also a 'Rampage' mode that allows humans versus human dinosaurs... so you can live your dream of being a T-Rex and eating people.  The game also features an in-game store with microtransactions, using Spiral Coins:  1,000 Coins - $1.00 6,000 Coins - $5.00 13,000 Coins - $10.00 75,000 Coins - $50.00  Thankfully, this store is PURELY cosmetic with most items costing $1 dollar. No xp boosts, or in-game upgrades... the most you can purchase are hats and skins for your marine or dino. At most, I can see just spending a max of 6,000 coins to get a character the way you want him to look, unless you want to go deeper with customization.  The few things I can say bad about this game is that the maps and waves in conquest mode still seem too large. Gathering your entire army to move from base A to base B after you've spent 10 waves defending base A really doesn't make you feel like that base is 'yours'. Also, some weapons are more overpowered than others; and some items aren't that useful to invest your time into (IMHO, the flame turret). On top of that, dinos tend to 'pop in' if they're too far away... making a hunt for a large dino that you can idenifty close by a bit harder to locate. Also, the populations for game modes seem to be a bit low in my taste, with conquest allowing up to 5 people per server. Other modes have different population caps, but overall it feels small. The menu UI structure also is a bit hard to get used to... with the whole menu UI coming off a bit cheap. Granted, the old menu system from two years ago was DREADFUL, and this is an improvement... it's still not up to par with most games.  However, these are nitpicks for a game that really has been risen from the ashes of it's former self. The developers are very active in the games future, and this game does have the love and dedication of a passion project come to life. There's constant free updates to this game, and new features being added all the time; as well as having the team be very approchable with ideas and suggestions. With the changes I've seen with the past two years... and (at the time of writing) a new version of the game in development which will expand on this game, allowing for new features... including a persistant open-world game mode, ala Planetside 2... I can safely say that this game has a bright future.  If you had met me two years ago and asked about this game, I would have told you to never play it... to stear clear, and forget about it... If you had bought it, to try and ask for a refund.  Nowadays, I'd be asking if you wanna buddy up and kill some dino's in a APC. It's improved that much, and I'd be MORE than willing to give it a recommendation. It's cheap, it's fun, it's OOZING with Sci-Fi goodness, and there arn't many games out there like it.",
