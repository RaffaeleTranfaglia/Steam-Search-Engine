            "review_text": "Review for current version 10/13/14. ver: 8.2.18. Battlegoat Studios featuring a realtime Geo-Political strategy game with pause / play action in single player. With the inclusion of all previous titles sandbox games, campains, and scenerios. This game does have it all, you can acess it all from Missle Defense Sattelites to Strategic Warfare ( NUKES :). Plan your strategy, choose your allys, pick your enemys, Revive forgotten / exiled nations, Liberate europe, Research techs started from the years 1900 to 2070, Become allied allligned or axis, create your role in your play. All and all they've done it right. Timeless game here, countless hours of playtime, although you should keep track so you dont lose track of time!   3/19/2015  most hated past technical issues.. fixed. -Loans fixed - you can take out and payback loans now as of december -Previously randomly losing money? - could've been the income report bug that was fixed. -Weather system does have an effect on battles, troop movement speed, moral, efficiency. -Battle Goats decision going to rubber from water influence you to much, the turnaround is very good, as everyone in earth needs rubber to fight war. -The world war 2 campaigns are great..their alot of historically accurate events. -Another isssue people had, you had to play with spheres ( axis / allied ) you can now turn that option off/on. -You can change up your map settings before starting your game to randomize the volatility of the map. -With my hours playing this game, 36' economy becomes an issue in the game but only while playing 36 campaign. Later down the road in the 45-49's if you dont build up oil derreks then the world goes dry of oil.  Now speaking for cold war about the economy, that is soo balanced you can play it for a long time without running into issues, but you might have to build up some rubber as way down the road in 80s you notice rubber becoming needed..  now the 2020, nothing needed in the world, market is suppressed with all goods, ready for some fighting..  All and all the game has improved from alpha, and i've been through all its hurdles and issues, its come a long way to becoming the Ultimate Supremre Ruler.   Since the start of the game, every 6 weeks the developers updated the game they're working on, balacing, and fine tuning their game, it's only going to get better from here.  - Common major issues right now Multiplayer De-sync after 20-30 minutes of play.",

This particular game is the pinnacle of the series - it has scenarios for modern, cold war and interwar eras from the previous Supreme Ruler games. So this game has all those scenarios plus all the new features and newer game engine resulting in a very believable geopolitical simulator.   Basicaly you get to choose any single country in the world and play as its supreme ruler in economy, political, diplomatical, military etc matters. If that sounds appealing - this game is for you.",

            "review_text": "  Not for the casual, this is one of, if not the most detailed geopolitical simulator on the market. The level of detail given can be intimidating, but overall commands to your cabinet take alot of the deep and complex sliders and controls out of your hand unless you wish to do those yourself.  Gameplay: for the most part you will be staring at a map for long periods of time, occassionally broken up by the slider or statsheet and trade negotiation. This is not a pretty game by any aspect of the word, but the level of detail and day by day operations make your building of an empire all the more personal. because it is a geopolitical game, you will encounter historical figures leading nations, and having to decide if allying with them would be best for your politica gains. Is Hitler the guy you want to be buddy buddy with, or Stalin, or maybe the U.S., China even. The choices are overwhelming, but offers large replayability  Replayability: high, you can play as any and all nations. Jamaica? yep. Lithuania? sure. tajiristan? you betcha. USA? newb.",

Theres nothing better to me in this game then starting of as a terrible countrey that today is still a third world country and bring it up and make it grow into such a power that its competing in the space race not with U.S.A or the USSR but by its self and its winning. That to me is enough to make me want to play this game over and over agin because you can change a whole history of events like what if Germany and there allies actually won world war 2, or what if the cubin missle crysis went hot would anyone survive. This game provides so many diffrent options that i find it hard not to like. So if you want a good Country simulator that your choices good or bad can change how the world is later then i would suggest this game.",

            "review_text": "Really really good game takes a while to get the hang of everything. Would advise to start a few games just messing about figuring out all the little options in game you dont know about from Transporting units via Plane, Ship or Crossing rivers with mobile Bridge/Pontoon Units, using landing ships to land troops and vehicles where there is no Sea Pier/Port or using Planes to parachute units in to locations with no Airfield/Airport. It gets very interesting when u find out all the small things like giving Units certain missiles and not just having them autodeployed all the small options you did not know to learning how much weight a Plane/Ship can carry and checking a units weight to see if and how many can be transported.  There is so many small options there you do not now about till u read about it in the Warfare guide and other places. Game is slow to start as all games are but once you get going and learning all the different options it gets to the piont were u are actually planning an Invasion on a country is a complex task as something as simple as not checking there Allies, Capture a Sea port/pier can cause a hole different out come as I have many a times invaded a country and did not capture or see a Port/Pier and be winning the battle next min I know that countrys allies start poring units into the Port/Pier I did not see or capture and my forces get out numbered and I need to fall back and seat down at the table hoping I can get a Cease Fire in place and rethink the invasion plan again. You can start creating armys and building battle groups from a starting army of 1000+ units One units does not mean just one unit that one unit could have 50-500 troops in it Warfare Guide will explain it better. So 1000 units is alot would be well over 1 Million men in that army but ive had up to 4300+ game. 150-200 units in each battle group is normally more than enough but you need to keep troops in reserve and keep troops deployed around different parts of ur country so the Enemy does not invade a Port and start moving inland capturing Land, Citys/Towns, Ports/Piers, Factorys/Fortifications. There is alot to take into account but not so much u have to micromanaging everything u have Defence/Finance Minister etc.. to help out with alot of tasks giving them the power to sort out stuff as u do the important things. When you attack, attack from different postions with at least 6 or more battle groups break down the 150-200 unit BGs into three smaller BGs all having different places to capture from Airfields to stop enemy planes attacking you or calling in ur own units via Air-Transport planes taking over Sea Ports/Piers to stop allies of the country from reinforceing them beware of allies naval vessels blockade of sea ports/piers or u will not be able to stop them reinforcing. I could go on for days and talk about the invasions I Succended/Failed hahaha",

First game I tried I spent sooo long 'paused' trying to figure ♥♥♥♥ out the game literally crashed.  Second time around I unpaused at the slowest (very slow) speed and felt my way around... No crash this time bros.  I chose the resource rich dictatorship in the south east of Asia known as Myanmar (or Burma) - mostly because of Lethwei, the combat sport they have other there - and because resource rich.  Well it turns out being a dictatorship, you can sell all your resources for billions and billions and then some more billions and do whatever you like with it, like buy tons of heavy military hardware and look to Invade Bangladesh.  Haven't gotten there yet, mooting whether I should turn into a liberalised laissez faire dictatorship and be the centre of commerce in the SE.  If geopolitical sandbox with masssssssssive scope for war/economy/political game play - then you will make a mistake in not getting SRU. ",

            "review_text": "I have mixed feelings about this game. On the one hand it's clear that a lot of effort went into making the game a believable simulation, it plays and feels a lot like Hearts of Iron 3. You can play many nations during various points in history and there are a variety of scenarios and challenges.  On the other hand, the interface could use a lot of work, information is not efficiently communicated to the player and it's not filtered well so players can become overwhelmed with useless and trivial spam. The interface is also overwhelming, and lacks adequate tool tips. The game also has an extremely steep learning curve, and the tutorial isn't user friendly.  So this really awesome game that gets so much right has a prohibitive user interface system, and because of that most (like me) will likely only just scratch the surface.",

I wouldn't be upset if they actually made performance impovments, but they simply don't. With a high end computer the game comes to a screetching hault after 10 to 15 years of game play.  What they need to fix: - Move away from 32bit, and make this game 64bit. This game needs the extra ram and 4gb does't suit it. - Allow annexing specific hexes. - Problems that were in SCRW, two games ago, are still here. If you take over lets say czechoslovakia, it doesnt give you the option to colonize it. It simply just annexs it. You had two seperate games to fix this. - How about use more than one core for this game. I have an i7, and it should be shredding this game. But it simply doesn't.",

I have followed Supreme Ruler since 2020 after my friend tipped me, got the Gold expansion and couldnt wait for Ultimate to get out. The problem we had was not being able to play together, which most likely is the only fun when it comes to this game, sitting alone is like playing the cardboard game Risk all by yourself for several hours.   - Singleplayer works flawless - LAN multiplayer works, but insanely boring - Online does not work.  There's tips of using Gameranger, Hamachi etc. to build up a 'fake LAN'. works 1/10 times after disconnecting and connecting and it always ends with the game desynchronizing. I Believe 10 players together playing this game would be more or less the ultimate feeling of ultimate. But as of now, just a let down.  Singleplayer has better options than LAN? Playing the Campaing or just random Sandbox on singleplayer, I was able to make every country my colony if I wished, as long as I had the troops to do so. I could free other countries by Liberating them and making them my allies or just simply claim the land. Playing 2+ removes the option of Annexing, Liberating and Colonizing.  When it comes to the haste of the game, we could understand that using 'Fastest' as speed was only for singleplayer, as it makes your PC work at it's strongest will to make the game go at über speed. But not even Very Fast was working as the game got Desynchronized, leaving us to send the savefiles over and restart. We were stuck playing at Fast which... for a game likes this, feels very slow. Especially for the buildings taking up to 700 days to complete. (Research facility).  Do I recommend this game? Yeah sure, if you dont have any internet.  Otherwise, no.",

If you want geopolitical strategy, go for Victoria II (especially HoD), if you want mililtary strategy, go for Total War. In the end, like me probably, after struggling through hours of slight unit moves in an arcane system, you'll end up writing off the money you lost. C'est la vie. But be warned.",
