The controlls are solid but i had trouble in the puzzles which required you to move pipes out of the way by hitting them with a beam, they never seem to move in the direction which you expect and because the target moves with the pipe it will often stop when you miss and start going the other way.",

However, there are currently a considerable amount of things that need to be addressed and fixed/changed by the developers. I've made a video review of LRT4 which you   view here   for all the details.  While my rating is currently 'not recommended', it is very subject to change upon the game's improvement!  It should be noted that my playtime isn't accurately reflected here as this isn't my primary account I use for playing games.",
