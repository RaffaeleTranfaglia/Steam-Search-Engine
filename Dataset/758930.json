    "minimum_requirements": "OS: Windows 7* Processor: 2.4Ghz* Memory: 2000 MB RAM Graphics: NVIDIA GTX660 or equivalent* Storage: 150 MB available space Additional Notes: * I'm pretty sure the min spec should be much lower than this, but I don't have a hardware compatibility lab on hand. XP is probably fine, and I suspect you could run a GPU half as powerful. If you do use a machine below this spec, and the game runs okay for you, could you let me know? Thanks &lt;3",
