            "review_text": "Unepic is an old-school indie RPG that’s rough around the edges but still has a lot to offer. You play as Daniel, a typical nerd who suddenly finds himself either hallucinating or somehow transported inside the tabletop game he’s been playing—he’s not sure which.  Soon after, you are exploring a castle full of deadly enemies and traps, searching for the exit. The dungeon is divided into segments typical of a Metroidvania, requiring you to power up, level up, defeat an area’s boss to obtain a key so you may progress to the next area, and so on. The boss battles themselves are well-crafted and interesting, except for one that effectively forces you to drop your items on the ground, which was a terrible idea.   You’ll meet a reluctant companion very early on who will remain with you throughout the game and serves as the other half of most of the dialog and story. The dialog tends to be on the humorous side and tries, maybe a little too hard, at incorporating some nerd humor and pop culture references into everything you do.  There are many secrets to be found within the walls of the castle; shopkeepers and quest givers to meet; pets to recruit, who will follow you around and offer unique abilities; and in-game challenges to complete, which are actually quite challenging. A robust magic system, based on reagents and eight schools of magic, is in place along with alchemy and your typical melee and ranged skills and weapons. Leveling up will let you distribute stat points and skill points across these as you see fit, with harder difficulties rewarding you with more points to distribute as well as the ability to save your game manually.  Unepic does have its flaws: Other than the humor not being for everyone, even people who typically don’t get hung up on graphics may find the game to be ugly and, while the lighting can be nicely done, the minigame of wading through the darkness to light all the torches can become tiring, as can climbing ladders on every screen. In spite of this, a solid RPG lies at the core and it’s obvious the developer put a lot of work, and love, into making the game.",

            "review_text": "You know what the problem is with fantasy parodies? The task seems to be too easy. How hard can it be? A bunch of old guys with long white beards, couple of mentally disabled protagonists, dark overlord behaving like an angsty teenager — there you have it, add a few butt jokes and we’re good. And when you look closer it turns out there’s not a lot of more than a mix-up of ♥♥♥♥ jokes, fart jokes and lots of people “hilariously” falling for whatever reasons. When the genre itself is balancing acrobat on the string of heroic attitude strained upon an abyss of mindless self-repetitive nonsense, it's so easy to make a parody that is just bad example of the genre itself. I think you guessed what I think of UnEpic’s script. It’s a story of pimply geek Daniel, teleported into the dungeons of castle of the Dark Overlord right in the middle of D&amp;D session. And if that doesn’t give you enough notion, this magical transportation happened when he walked to have a leak, because he drank too much beer. Upon arrival our hero makes contact with some dark spirit, it ends up with spirit being trapped in protagonist’s body (or rather mind?) and capable of nothing more than talking. And that he does a lot! Mostly sarcastically, and rarely speaking the truth. Believing that he’s having a very realistic hallucination our ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ protagonist starts his quest, which is of course nothing less than slaying the biggest villain here. And so it starts, the mix-up of ♥♥♥♥ jokes, and fart jokes and quests which quite bluntly task you with ♥♥♥♥ing an orc; and ex-virgin geek is happy to do it. So, if UnEpic couldn’t give you anything besides this rather unartful humour it shouldn’t be even worth writing about. But thankfully from a merit of a game it’s no joke. The game won’t win a prize for the most sophisticated world, but it sure is vast. There’s no shortage of easily missable side-quests, different enemies and varying pieces of valuable equipment. But while actually there’s not a lot of need for trying out some magic or ranged weapons, you sure can experiment a lot. But hey, no every game can be Transistor and give you a meaningful stimulus for trying out everything. Sometimes the joy of toying with varying mechanics is enough of a reward for itself. What sure is absolutely mandatory for easy game progression is crafting and collecting all sort of magical scrolls, wands and ingredients for making potions. Power-ups help quite a lot, especially on those hard-hitting bosses, who usually aren’t very tricky, but require a bit of a precise movement which isn’t something that can be easily achieved considering monstrous control scheme (and I don’t even want to know into a what more horrible mess it become when game was ported on Wii U). All the downsides of the game are tolerable in the end, when it comes to really superb level design, with a slow but interesting progression path. The castle slowly turns from Terra Incognita into your playground, where you casually go for a walk for another pack of so valuable satyr intestines. Then there’s this key and that key, and new area, and new enemies which require careful planning before you rush off into the battle. Monsters are quite powerful, have the same reach as a player and often enough they output more damage, while being invincible to some types of attack. UnEpic looks, feels and plays a lot like very old metroidvania, and even contains homage to The Maze of Galious, 1987 game by Konami for MSX and Famicom; developer calls it the main source of inspiration for a game. This retro-feel sure is nice, it has a substance of real love to those games, and while sometimes it can be a bit rough to get in to, it sure knows what to do once the player got its pace.",

Yep, take a look at some random Greenpo..erm..light titles nowdays and you will be astonished at the above decision. It's a one-man-game and for that it gets extra points for being so good at what it does. The price may seem a bit steep-ish but  it's totally worth it.   ",

TLDR: Refined retro-style graphics Good humor, option to switch between adult humor and.. safer humor Platformer, simple combat system with flexibility Lots of items, weapons, and spells Rogue-like atmosphere, but maybe not mechanics Simple RPG skill tree that doesn't take hours to master  UnEpic, at first glance, is a platformer with CGs and very simplistic, almost retro-style graphics and UI. The graphics may look subpar compared to modern gaming, but remember that the game is based off of Metroidvania, 2D hack and slash with more emphasis on action than aesthetics. When you start up the game, you get a cutscene of a couple of guys playing Dungeons and Dragons, with nothing but an overhead lantern and a ton of beer. Next thing you know, you're in a medieval castle filled with traps, monsters, and loot. The rest is up to you. UnEpic is a great game. Gameplay wise, you have simple yet complex with a basic 'space to attack' and arrow key movement. Throw in about 10 different weapon types, pets that assist in combat and out, potions that have various effects, and an expansive (it's not that bad) character skill page. You now have a game that combines the best of rogue-like, RPG, hack and slash, and platformer. As for the protagonist, you play as Strider, also known as Aragorn II, son of Arathorn and his companion Zera, the wight of- Nevermind, your name is Daniel. You're a gamer, a sci-fi fanatic, and you have a sharp tongue for sarcasm and inappropriate jokes, especially at the expense of the equally as sarcastic spirit that tried and failed to possess you. Expect every encounter with friend, or foe, to make you smile at least once before blood is spilt. The castle itself is a labyrinth of rooms that, thankfully, do not change constantly. Explore, fill in your map and make notes on what's here, what's there, where your quest door is- Light up rooms full of monsters and treasure, and a ton of breakable barrels. For the completionists, grab every chest and light every torch. For the hunters, destroy every monster in your path with the arsenal of weapons and magics stuffed in the side pocket of your jeans. Expect alarming encounters with big bosses like dragons or worms, and swarms of smaller minions like.. dragons. And worms. Collect materials, brew potions, find gold, buy loot. You want candles? You want swords? You want books? Zoran, Zorak, Ubuntu, and Fedora have got you covered. Do menial tasks for handicapped goblins! Ever wanted to kill the puppy-version of Sindel? How about look for a silver ring in a dark room? How about go rescue an ice elemental from a boiling cauldron? Buy this game! It has singleplayer and multiplayer, the latter of which I have not tried but it looks awesome. Set aside a lot of time, however. Postpone that Dungeons and Dragons game with your buddies until next week. But whatever you do, don't go to the bathroom with the lights off.",

            "review_text": "UnEpic is a brilliant (not so) little indie game. We accompany a real-life 'nerd' that gets sucked into a castle full of traps and hostile creatures, trying to find his way out of the 'hallucination', he gets possessed, by one of the guardians of the castle, which doesn't really go too well for both of them. And this where the fun begins.  The whole game is kept in a comedic setting, which is upheld mainly by the witty dialogues (monologues?) between the 'hero' and the spirit. There are lots of references and parodies of different fantasy and science-fiction films throughout the gameplay. The story, even though fairly simple, is actually quite interesting and I caught myself wondering 'how will this end?' many time when playing. However, on several occassions, the humour was just too low and a bit cringeworthy (most notably, 'a dream come true' quest, argh!). Apart from that, seeing the two main characters, argue or make fools of one another was really enjoyable.  As for the game itself, I was surprised by the sheer amount of possibilities to build your character. One is given plenty of tools to do the job right and can just pick the ones that suit him the most. I rarely replay games, but I'm sure I could play UnEpic again, levelling my character in a totally different way and would still succeed. The game doesn't hold one by his hand too much, so sometimes a little thinking is required, when trying to complete some quests. That said, there are scrolls sold by one merchant in the game that will point you out directly to the places you need to go, if someone would get stuck and wouldn't like to search for the answers in the Internet.   Mechanically, the game was ok. The character response to pressing buttons felt a bit weird at first, but I got used to it fairly quick and it didn't bother me at all for the rest of the time. I think, the feeling of unresponsiveness was mainly caused by the fact that the attack animations are somewhat long and that makes attacking and dodging harder. That said, this is not a trick jump, button mashing game, so it's not THAT important. In most cases, the strategy of beating a room/boss is much more important than the execution of it.  As I've already mentioned bosses, UnEpic features some really enjoyable boss fights. Every boss requires a different tactics, which you have to work out in few tries usually. And that is usually enough to beat every boss, except one, which I didn't really like, who is really annoying and requires you to, actually, throw away most of your stuff from the inventory or face death. Apart from that one fight, the others are really great and fulfilling.  The graphics and music (was there even music?) is a totally different story and this is where the 'Indie' shows. I really can't tell if there was music in the game, if there was, I turned it off almost instantly and used my own playlists for the background soundtrack. On the other hand, the voicing is on a decent level, the characters sounded as one could think judging by how they were depicted. The graphics is, well, not so good, so this might be a chokepoint for some players, who look for some high-budget, 3d, flashy backgrounds and animations. Some enemies/bosses look a bit kitschy, but to be honest, the gameplay and the way story goes makes up for that totally.  I've encountered few bugs and crashes, nothing too serious though. Two most annoying were stucking movement and automatic resolution changes. The first one appeared several times to me and even got me killed once or twice, the second one was a bit weird and might have been caused by me pressing some hidden key combination (no idea, couldn't find anything) and was resolved by exiting and entering the saved game. Not sure if others also got those, or is it me doing something wrong. Anyway, nothing too groundbreaking and spoiling the fun too much.  All in all, I really do recommend UnEpic, even at the full price. It is a really fine mix of witty dialogues, crude and/or intelligent humour, movie references, difficulty level and boss fights. What's more, it gives you about 15h+ of gameplay (medium difficulty, all quests), which is a fair amount of time, not too much and definitely not too little. So, if you're on the fence about buying UnEpic, take my word and get it, it's worth it.  P.S. Wow, the ending is really cool!",

Dagger does bonus damage from stabbing in the back, polearms have longer reach, sword swings slightly faster, maces/axes can break hard objects, bows can be used to either pick off enemies at a distance or you can shoot one, get its attention and draw it over to you and dispatch it quietly as to not alert the other enemies. spells actually require materials to use (and you have to learn/earn the ability use each element of magic) The references to other things (such as LoTR, Golden Child, Star Wars) are somewhat subtly put in (whereas some of them are shoved in your face and you are like 'Yeah i get it. you are trying to make a reference'). Rather than just being a generic hack and slash, loot collection game this actually has a story. and the side missions are actually worth doing! they give you things that aren't required for the main story but make it easier along the way.

However the later part of the game is just very one sided. For a start, bosses. Literally the only bosses that I could kill using melee was the first worm and the eyeball. The rest was just a magic spam. Secondly, weapon balance. Seriously the bow damage and magic damage difference is just far far too much to the point that I never used a bow the moment I learned my first magic ability. Thirdly, healing. What kind of game doesn't sell potions? Crafting potions asides, why can't I even craft multiple potions all at once?? Its not like monster would come into the caldron room and stab me. And finally, autosaves and manual saves. This is the first offline game I've seen without a manual save which can be very frustrating when you have to walk the previous 2 maps just to get back to where you died because autosave happens in like every ?? minutes. Overall, if you're a melee lover, I won't really recommend this game as half the time, you'd get knocked down from a cliff if you try to smack a target guarding a chest there and so on.

            "review_text": "Since this game was advertised as a Metroidvania style game, and I have enjoyed that genre a great deal in the past I figured I would give this game a go. Sad to say that it seemingly takes the worst aspects of the genre and drops what makes games like Castlevania great.   The combat and platforming are very sluggish, leaving little room for dodging or complex maneuvers. The game does accommodate this style of slower more deliberate gameplay, but it leaves little room for interesting enemy dynamics or platforming puzzles. The mechanics never really felt natural as I played, though the difficulty never rose to the point where I had to hone my mechanics or knowledge of the game even on a higher difficulty. The boss fights are pretty simplistic since the game does not expect you to be able to move a great deal.    The RPG aspects generally just randomly help or hurt you rather than truly encourage different styles of play. If you decide to go into axes vs. maces, the only real difference will be some enemies take more damage from one. I ended up just saving up points for if a challenge presented itself and I needed to skill differently rather than develop an actual character.    The writing is quite awful, perhaps some of the worst I have seen in a game (a quick note to writers, a reference is not a joke), with the low handing fruit of nerd jokes making up a majority of the humor (think Big Bang Theory). So the writing ranges from cringe inducing references (having Admiral Ackbar say “It’s a trap”, literally), to just lazily having Zoidberg run across the screen.    The art design is not particularly inspired, with sprite design looking closer to stock images and backgrounds with very little definition or dynamism.  There were a few good aspects to the game that kept it appealing for a time. The exploration was crafted with more care than the other areas mentioned above, with a cool lighting mechanic to encourage discovery. The magic system is pretty intricate and has some good ideas tucked in there (though there was some required grinding involved).   Overall though the exploration action platformer genre is getting quite light these days, but there are better titles that are not weak in so many areas. I am really disappointed in this title considering its promise.   ",

Here's a warning though, it WILL have you pulling your hair out, rage quitting and yelling profanity at the screen. These are the qualities that make it a good game though, it will not let you just sun around with a sword and slash everything till it dies. You can try, but you'll die. You actually need to think to complete some of the later stages of the game, but there is almost always more than one tactic that could be employed.  There is a certain boss that people are crying about on the forums, frankly I found him to be one of, possibly the best, boss in the game. Why? Because he is ****ing irritating as hell, has a ton of cheap tricks and you will have to reload earlier saves the first few times you face him unless you pick up on the very, very tiny hints to his abilities or read up on him. Why does this make him a good boss? Because I had to change my boxers after finally killing him, it was that damn satisfying.  This game does not cater to the new generation of whiny gamers who want to be handed everything for repeatedly bashing a single button. It is a throwback to when games were brutal and were designed to stop you completing them, not help you. Personally, this is the type of game I love.  Old review: I normally don't review, but UnEpic has earned this one fair and square. Hands down one of the best games I've played in the last year.  I've played 9 hours, almost straight(damn real life commitments), so far. Playing on Hard and completing everything I see. Despite this game's name I can assure you, it truely is epic. It costs almost nothing and from the rate I'm going, I'm looking at 25-30 hours for a full complete, including the secret challenges, at a guess.  Combat I haven't found to be repetative at all yet, there are tricks to beating certain enemies but often the layout or other enemies mean you have to adjust your tactics. You can't just run around fireballing every monster, or whacking it with a sword.  The game has a ton of character and some of the cutscenes have had me sitting here laughing so much I've had to hide in a save spot till I could calm down.  I would have been quite happy with this game if I paid £15-20 for it, to get it for about £5 is unbelievable. You can tell this game was made by someone who wanted to release a great game and actually enjoys this genre, not by a corporation trying to cash in on what people want.

The RPG system has all the basics you'd expect, but adds nothing special. The combat is dull and annoying. Enemies are too easy if you have the right skills, but if you don't it becomes a very slow game of attack, retreat, heal, repeat. There is a lot of backtracking.   I might have enjoyed this game as a vanilla RPG game, but the addition of the awkward humor and the 'nasty nerd' main character makes it an unpleasant experience.",

I enjoy the kind of humor they've put in place,since your character is a real geek, there's lots of reference to video games,movies &amp; popular culture. So far so good, for 13$ I think it deffinetely worth it with the single player only but there's more to it as you can play it online too, co-op or pvp, official campaign or fan made maps !",

This game is very tongue in cheek, with a lot of humorous dialogue and tons of pop culture references. I never know what it's going to throw next at me.   Gameplay-wise, it's on the hard side. Controls are a bit sluggish but generally alright. Level gaining is on the slow side and there's a good deal of item management to be done, although I wouldn't go so far as to call it 'micro management'. You will learn to use your hot keys as you enable your bag of tricks to approach each situation. What's the right type of weapon for this? Maybe a spell? How about a potion to bypass a situation? The game gets you thinking about practical applications to your bag of tools, so to speak. Sometimes however, you just don't have anything relevant to use which can make an otherwise normal looking encounter damn near impossible.   UnEpic has bits of tutorial sprinkled throughout (admittedly, they come up at odd times) but the game doesn't hold your hand on much of anything- there's a lot you need to figure in terms of how something works. Losing hp for no clear reason? Check your inventory instead of your status display; you got leeches! Falling down a pit? No worries, you take no falling damage. But beware checking your inventory- the game doesn't pause during this! Once you get your head around the many quirks, you will find a tough game with a gigantic map, tongue-in-cheek jokes, and a challenge level that reminds me of old unforgiving games like the Pitfall series. Although frustrating at times, UnEpic is pretty damn sweet.",

I appreciated the ability to add notes to the in-game map, a feature so few games have.  It's humour invokes plenty of pop-culture references (and amusing guest appearances)... but be warned: the humour is sometimes surprisingly juvenile... the f-bombs, racial stereotypes and lewd sexual situations seem jarring sometimes in this environment. (There is an option to say you are under 16 years-old when you first run the game, which may actually fix this complaint if it removes the edgier stuff...)",

I didn't really expect to be so taken by the castle and the characters, but here I am a year later and I still fangirl over everything. Also, the maps are beautiful, and the music fits in perfectly with every setting! SO GOOD.

When Daniel heads to the bathroom, the lights go out and Daniel finds himself transported to a castle. Daniel shrugs this off as a hallucination and plays along with the cast of weird and wonderful characters he meets on his journey as fantasy. Daniel learns that his ultimate goal is progress through the castle and to slay its master – Harnakon.  UnEpic’s levels look like an 8-bit adventure game, littered with enemies, traps and rewards for the intrepid adventurer. The standard RPG components are in this game like: earning XP, upgrade abilities with points, making potions, learning spells, trading and encounter many different (funny) types of side quests.  The game tries its best to poke fun at itself, making jokes about the genre that it’s paying homage to, with nods to the classics weaved into the dialogue between Daniel and Anokra Bash.   UnEpic would be an excellent addition to any RPG fans library. UnEpic could ultimately be compared to 8-bit Marmite; if you love RPGs you’ll enjoy it – hate them and it’ll leave a bitter taste in your mouth and hunger for something different.",
