            "review_text": "After 30+ hours, I can't seem to get enough. Even after losing first campaign in Poland by 3 points. Always one more turn. The unique play makes it very interesting. I consider it one of the better operational level games I have played in a while. More meat than Unity of Command, yet not a huge learning curve either. Just have to think about what you want to do and how to do it without a lot of casualties and in the fastest amout of time. It is tough.  I recommend it highly, but wait till a sale. It is a older game and not worth $40. I found it hard to even pay $19.99, but it has been worth it so far. Be prepared to spend a lot of time with it thinking 'what If I moved here.....: or 'what is in that hex'. Seem to never have enough recon planes!",

            "review_text": "As mentioned before, this is a game that sits between Panzer General and War in the East. The card system gives you plenty of variation for replays. Poland and France put up a bit more of a fight than you would expect but there would be no challenge if the campaign allowed Germany to steamroll the opposition.   The campaign allows you to play as Germany in the Polish and French campaigns as well as Sealion if you perform well. It is possible to play as the opposing armies in scenarios. The game has play by e-mail multiplayer. The game is not difficult to grasp and there are Youtube lets play videos that will clear up any confusion.  If you enjoy hex and counter wargames this is for you, although the newst title in the series (currently Decisive Campaigns: Barbarossa) may be a better purchase.",
