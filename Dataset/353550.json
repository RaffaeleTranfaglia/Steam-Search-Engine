            "review_text": "A pretty short game, but well worth the $6. Not really horror, but an atmospheric, creepy game much more like 'Gone Home'. The puzzles are pretty strightforward, there were one or two that had me scratching my head, but all in all a good game. My only real complaints are that it could use a bit more optimization, and some of the physics on the items are a bit wonky. Recommended!",

        {
            "review_text": "An exploration game with trivial point-and-click adventuring, insignificant puzzles, and minor jump scares. The mansion is pretty and the visuals very atmospheric, but unfortunately the story is uninteresting, obvious, and very poorly told. The voice acting is very amateurish and breaks whatever atmosphere is created by the visuals.  There's some raw talent behind this game, but the production team really needs to sit down and design an engaging story before building a complete game.",

After playing this game I can probably say I now do. Walking up stairs in this game felt like I was a stick of melting butter. Also the story is boring.",
