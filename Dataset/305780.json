            "review_text": "I have to admit, this game has largely exceeded my expectations, and this was just in the first couple of hours. I was ready to quickly label it as one of the many wannabe-artsy games that focus on a (sometimes cryptic) story and have little-to-no thought about the actual gameplay, a genre that has become so popular lately, but even though it's a little pretentious in its use of words, it is definitely way more than that.  Surviving is, in fact, not so easy at all, you'll have to plan your day carefully and act accordingly (and hope nothing else distracts you along the way). I especially liked the twist on the map exploration and crafting mechanics, you only have a limited number of slots to 'remember' places or tools you found and you have to decide what to keep in order to help your survival.  What else can I say? It also has an honest price, in my opinion, for what it offers, so it can be a nice little addition to the library.",

            "review_text": "When I first bought this game about a year ago it was too difficult, but several updates later I have given it another go. It is very playable now. Still a challenging game, but the survival aspect no longer overpowers the puzzle/discovery parts. The style is cool, and the story is unique. Definitely worth buying even at the full price (totally a steal on sale).  Only warning is that there isn't a very interactive community around the game unless you want to come in and make one. The wiki is pretty empty and there is only 1 basic guide. You will be alone in the wildy :P Well almost alone... [*spooky noises*]  ",

            "review_text": "A 2D crafting/survival adventure/time-managment game with decent visuals and an okay theme/story. As a warning, I never finished the game (due to reasons below).  Days are split up into 4 time-sections and you choose where to explore each day until you run out of time. Any action that goes into the 4th time section will be limited as night approaches and the darkness stops your ability to interact with the environment (without a torch). One of the most important things you need to learn is that returning to camp costs no time so you need to drop off everything unnecessary in between areas (because inventory space is pretty limited).  Your only basic necessities are managing your hunger/thirst meters and gathering enough wood for the night's fire. Your goals beyond that are to tribute food/precious materials at the altars for more recipes, explore different areas, and learn more about the world's mechanics to survive into later seasons.  Personally, I would've liked a casual mode where you could save freely. It might go against the experience that the dev intended, but that experience isn't the kind I enjoy. Saving always seems like a waste of precious time because it takes up a quarter of the day and an offering. I think I read that the dev could 100% it before the end of summer (although he has added more things since then) so maybe time isn't an issue to someone who has mastered the game. However, that's not something you'd normally know and I've been a hoarder of rare consumables in RPGs and wasting a quarter of a day to save often is something I don't want to do.  My game locked up when I accidentally used reeds on a reed patch (no buttons responded except for the menu to quit the game) and I lost several in-game days of progress. On a x360 controller 'use' is mapped to B and 'cancel' is mapped to X (which was the opposite of what I'm used to) so that happened several times. Other than that, I didn't see any other bugs.  However, you might like that challenging/hardcore feel of needing to go through many playthroughs in order to learn, understand and get a little further in the game next time. This is a game that you need to get deeply invested in to do well at because there are a lot of little things you have to deal with.",

The writing is strange and somewhat clunky, but also endearing somehow (at least to me). the survival and narrative parts are neatly brought together in an unusual way. the fact that i still can't save after 2 hours bothers me, though, but i have time so i don't mind.",
