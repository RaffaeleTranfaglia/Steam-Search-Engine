When the news reports the zombies are here and your friend gives you a call, &quot;They're here. I need you,&quot; how will you respond? That's right, you'll say &quot;I'll be right over. We've got this thanks to ZTS!",

I've so far had the vive for a week and have around 70 games/demoes so far.  This is by far one of my top 5 games for VR. If you want a great shooter, this is the one to get - the feel of the shooting rivals H3VR, even though it is cartoon zombies - the graphics, especially when it comes to the iron sights is crystal clear which makes it a lot more realistic to aim properly than in most other VR shooters I've tried so far. I've been in the military for over 20 years now, so I have some experience firing guns, and something about the mechanics in this game makes it feel right.  Do NOT let the cartoony style fool you - this is a must buy for your Vive - it is worth every penny!  Edit: If I could ask for one single addition it would be to allow for manual reload of weapons using your offhand vive controller the same way it is done in H3VR. That would make it all but perfect.",

Yes Just a handfull of guns...Yes Just a handfull of levels...Yes So I start by tossing out the stereo, place the propane tanks on the table and pick em off, or mow em down either way it's fun as all hell. I just wish I had a grill behind the table to cook up those unthrown steaks. I've played this longer than a couple minutes and I'll tell ya now this is fun! Looking forward to new modes and a bigger arsenal. OMG A MINIGUN WOULD BE FLIPPIN AWESOME! Except the reload... that would probably suck.",

If you like wave shooters, this is a polished one with some nice crowd-control-based gameplay, lots of guns to choose from, and some neat minigames and such. If you like zombie games, this is a kid-friendly one with a 'hardcore/night mode' that actually manages to be somewhat more tense as well.  It's a super well-rounded, well-executed game, but the core gunplay isn't all that interesting. It's mostly aiming at a bunch of zombie heads, most of which are at the exact same height, and right next to each other. As I said, the real mechanics are in the crowd control and resource management mechanics.  It's a good game, and it held my interest for a good while, but I'm not sure I'd have payed $20 for it. Still, glad to have it.",

Most definitly a game to pick up. 19,99 euroes might seem like much, but this is well polished, and a great thing to show other people. If you're not a fan of wave shooters, don't buy this. If you are however, this is probably one of the most well done ones.  I know I'll come back to this every now and then.  Co-op would be extra fun though. ",

I am glad i did not do that.  The graphics are simple but work so so well. this is a stationary wave shooter, your enemies are cardboard cutout zombies, and dispite how aweful that sounds, its very addicting. there are multiple maps which change up stratagies, and a healthy selection of loadouts to unlock. you have variosu tools in each map that respawn with each wave, wave which can cotain hundreds of on screen enemies at once (im fairly sure i obviosuly have not counted) The sound assets are solid, and honestly for as simple as it is i have had loads and laods of fun, this is a great title to demo the vive on.  Now at 20 bucks i know alot of people may not get their money worth, i certianlly cannot say since mine was a package deal, but i can tell you ive had a good bit of fun, and if its on sale, deff worth a try.",

The developers did the in game feeling of holding a real weapon when you are really holding a Vive controller. My favorite in game weapon is the Glock as it is the lightest weapon in the game's arsenal and closest to the controller size and weight. The grip angle is right and the you can sight down the weapon as in real life and you can even do position Sul or other ready positions. There are no reload mechanics as reloading is automatic.  The game also has a high replay value as the game consist of quick challenges that last from a little over a second each to survival modes that may last 5 to 10 minutes each.",

A Wave Shooter game with various weapon types and modifiers (grenades, propane tanks, steaks to attract zombies, etc.) that also has 'skill tests' and free-form play. I would highly recommend this game to anyone that can play it. I've had zero issues with performance (6700K @4.7 ghz + GTX 980).  PROs: - wide variety of guns - increasing difficulty with different 'maps' and waves - creativity with types of zombies and the effects they have - there's always a katana strapped to your back for last ditch efforts (that's saved me a few times) - the music is fun to listen to (I love 'Strummin' ') and I kinda dance while holding dual pistols - there's a 'hardcore' mode where you play at night. Instead of being able to see all the zombies, you have to shine your flashlight (attached to each weapon) to see them, so always check behind you.  CONs: - the sound is too loud by default, so turn it down - some of the weapons take a long time to unlock (end game guns are 50,000 kills, I'm at 14,000 kills after a couple hours, but I haven't found a way to increase my kill rate) - would love even higher difficulty in terms of number of zombies rather than being in the dark",
