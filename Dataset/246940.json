            "review_text": "Buyer Beware!   I bought the game during early access, participated in the forums and suggested ways to make the game more thematic. The Devs responded with a 'yea...but' claiming money and etc as a limitation. What they managed to put together is not a finished product and is by all means an early access build. No polish, no depth or immersion and absolutely no support post release. In recent posts, the Devs cited financial difficulties and made empty promises for upcoming updates. There are NO updates for more than a year now and their website is dead...In the meantime, the game is plagued with the same bugs and CTDs that it had in earlier builds. You want to open trade routes? Crush. You want to play a long game? Crush on random turn and crush again later on.   Another Early Access scheme: promising the impossible and blaming bad finances for their complete and utter failure to deliver. An almost formulaic approach to risk-free-failure: promise A, receive payment for A, deliver B with promises of A but without the means of delivering A…Classic bait and switch tactics under the grey area of Early Access.

            "review_text": "A very disappointing addition to the 4x Space Strategy game genre. I love the genre, and it seemed to look very nice, but the actual product was not as good as expected from the description, screenshots, and video. It seems to lack polish and actually seems somewhat unfinished, with plenty of bugs and lacklustre dev support.  On to the one pro I've found so far for the game... the hex-based, turn-based space combat is actually a quite interesting addition to the 4x space genre, and one that I quite like. Admittedly, it can turn into a bit of a chore once the participants have large fleets, if you can get to that stage... but I do like the idea.  However... the game is plagued with a multitude of crashes, which makes any sort of progress, especially in multiplayer, very frustrating. Even when you're lucky enough to not encounter a Crash to Desktop, the gameplay itself is not quite up to scratch. The tech tree and units are somewhat disappointing, and there are many better games out there if you want to customise your own space ships as part of your plans for galactic domination - which brings me to my next point - the galactic maps are pretty sub-par. It doesn't look nice, the travel is boring (there are no restrictions or wormholes or gravity wells or any other mechanic) between systems. There is an arbitrary limit on which systems you can travel though, in an expanding circle, but I have not been able to figure out how that works, but apart from that, you can travel to any system without any changes.  And the economic and diplomatic options are both also disappointing. This combos with the 8 'different races' you can play as or against - they don't look or feel different, and the bonuses and 'unique generals' aren't very noticeable. In combination with the lack of options, and a lack of descriptions of the various pre-game setup options... it just doesn't make for a compelling experience.  Especially for the asking price, you can do so much better if you are after a 4x space strategy game.",

            "review_text": "*Sigh* I wanted to play a 4X game with a futuristic space-setting so I tried this. (Also named 'Starlords'?)  This seems like an earlier version of Endless Space without the better graphics and user-friendly interface. I found the ship-design and fleet battles much too simplistic.  There also seemed to be a few glitches/bugs when many fleets were given orders at once.  Still... I played it twice to get all the achievements and to give it a decent chance before I wrote criticism. (That 15 hours I should have been doing something else...)  My opinion: get ENDLESS SPACE instead... a much better game that Lords Of The Black Sun seems to be just a rough, early design of.",

            "review_text": "seriously? i played 9 hours, and in that time i managed to win multiple games, and doing all achievments...  this game claims to be a 4x game, and it might well be, but make no mistake of comparing it to any serious veteran of that genre... if you are used to games like space empires IV, galactic civilisation III or lo and behold, Master of Orion II, then you will find this a heavily diluted 4x experience indeed....  Minimalistic tech tree, ship building that acutally doesn't deserve being called that (all you get are 4 different hulls you know from the start with a fixed tonnage of stuff you can squeeze in, no chance on improving that in any way...), 'tactical' combat that is too small and too limited in options (the lackluster techtree might play a part in that as well) without much variety and a relly simple interaction with other races really sum up this game perfectly....  Have a smattering of bugs and exploits on top of that (i still find it ridiculous how you can loan any alien race money, even if they are at war with you, and at like 100% interest...)  so, all i can say, if you search for a good 4x game..... keep searching, you won't find that with this title...",

            "review_text": "I really wanted to recommend this game. I love 4X space games and I was hoping that that alone will overcome all the problems this game might throw at me. Sadly I have to agree with other reviews – this game goes out of its way, to frustrate you, ruining any possible fun.  I guess I’m lucky in the fact that I got it on a huge discount (the only option I would recommend anyone getting this)  I don’t recommend playing this game on bigger size of galaxy when vs AI – the map is big enough anyway and tbh size differences in the galaxy settings are very small increments. The only reason I’d choose the bigger galaxy sizes is if I have all 8 factions in play, and most crucially playing it in multiplayer. The distance between systems vs the speed of the ships is really far and AI has an awful tendency to snatch the best planets from under your nose making all the empire borders look as a checkered patchwork of planets on the bigger maps.  Good: + Has multiplayer (every 4X tbs should imo) including LAN + You can scan planets to find out their bonuses (but this at times feels like a waste of time) + During exploration you find special debris that works as a special encounter + You can give speeches for glory-hole points + The type of government your empire has depends on your policies + I like the in-game music + You can do diplomacy with pirate clans - even use them to harass your enemies (AI factions will make sure they harass you anyway) + Different factions to play (8 total) – tech tree and buildings seem identical while govt type, faction bonuses, preferred planets and ship models differ + Trading cards + Diplomacy + Trade routes + Random events + Turn based battles on hex battlefield  Bad: - Multiplayer is human only. The game won’t let you add AI factions to play with you and your friends when you play multiplayer - Only two types (shapes) of galaxy to choose from disc or circle - Four main galaxy ambient backgrounds, nice bluish ones or an ugly muddy mustard ones - Reloading saved games is very bugged often creating weird things and most importantly – loading the next turn instead the one you saved the game at. - No sound in intro movies for me (have to watch them straight from the game folder in explorer to just get the vibe) - Alt-tab doesn’t work - No schematic view for ship designs you’ve already created makes it hard to remember what design had what module - Cycling between planets is bugged, if you go left then right… it will take you to the wrong planet, so basically you can cycle them just one way at a time - Game does feel empty at times, so I recommend you play it with good buddies to actually make up for less actual content  Ugly: - AI cheats, especially during colonization phase. AI factions have colony ships spawn out of nowhere right next to the planet you were on the way to colonize flying there over 10 turns. And in fact, if you load a save 3 turns earlier or so, their colony ship might spawn even sooner and it’s kind of like random which AI faction will it be, including those far far away from the colony you’re aiming for - AI cheats and gets at least 8 warships at the start of the game when they couldn’t possibly make them so fast (every AI faction gets it, not just the more industrious ones) - When you load the game your ships will all be crippled to 5AU speed instead of full speed, which further compounds the planet stealing by AI or outmaneuvering you since you won’t even be able to reach the target planet even if you adjust your planning with reloading the save - You can put more than 1 type of weapon on a ship design, but during a battle you can shoot only 1 weapon type at once per ship, while in practice this might make sense for you to say use missiles if enemy is away then beam/plasma when close, in practice you start the battle very close so firing long range loses the benefit and the limited number of hulls available in the game (4) makes it practically pointless to mix weapon types - There’s no experience on the ships, so fighting AI (pirates or other factions) is a chore, even on easy difficulty because they keep getting tons of new ships out of nowhere, while you need to keep sending your own at them over and over eventually running out of cash unless you have a very strong economy already. The good thing is that other than pirates AI factions tend to be rather peaceful so I’m not saying it’s impossible to beat them, it’s just far more frustrating and time consuming experience you would want  The game also has a “total war” option which puts all AI factions at war with each other since the beginning of the game, which theoretically might be better (haven’t tried it myself) but I worry it might make things worse and with the level of AI cheating they would simply all gang up on you from the start which is not fun at all.  I must be the lucky one because so far the game hasn’t crashed for me even once.  Bottom line is, it’s an overpriced, often frustrating 4X game with bluntly cheating AI. I still probably recommend it if you want to play it in multiplayer (just remember, no AI factions in multi) but mostly because I love space 4X games so that is my bias.",

I for one wont buy any more of their products as they have a bad track record now.  The game crashes all the time and I was so looking forward to it when it first came onto steam.
