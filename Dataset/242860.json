            "review_text": "We were sitting in this trench shooting at the people trying to take our trench, the guy next to me gets hit, i look at him, he falls down while grabbing his shoulder.  He screams in agony but i try to concentrate on my aim, after a while the screaming stops and i hit a guy who was a about 20 meters away from our trench.  Seconds later we get the message that we repelled the enemy attack, and we must try to take their trench now, Me and my squad jump over the top and start running. We are lucky, their machine gun saw another squad first, so they are the ones getting mowed down, I run past the guy who I shot earlier, he lays there in the mud, drowning in his own blood, I must have hit him in the throat. Suddenly our officer gets hit, their machine gun had chosen their next prey, me and our gunner jumped in one crater, our rifleman jumps in the crater next to us. we stayed in our craters untill the MG had lost intrest in us. the moment we decided to crawl out a mortar lands right into the crater next to us, i catch a quick glance of the burned torso that was once our rifleman. The gunner and me (grenadier) continue our run trough No man's land. We finally arrive at their trench, the Gunner sets up his MG and waits untill the enemy shows up, I watched his back. After a while we hear fire. I turn around, and see my gunner just before he gets taken by the Flamethrower of the enemy, I manage to get around a corner and throw two of my grenades in the trench were my gunner got killed. The explosion took two of them, I see a leg flying out of the trench. I'm now alone, i retreat from the trench, and when I'm out we get called back, our attack lost its momentum. I make it back in our trench. And it all starts again. nobody lost, nobody wins.  And this my childeren is your average match in Verdun.  11/10 A true masterpiece.",

            "review_text": "I was helping our squad attack the left flank of a trench. I was above the trench as a grenadier, when I turned and saw 5 enemies crouching to attack. I had the surprise on them and quickly took 2 out with my trusty K98 AZ before I readied a grenade to throw at them. They shot me, and my body fell into the trench, with the grenade pin pulled. As they walked over me, I was holding the grenade, and soon enough, it detonated, taking the 3 remaining soldiers with me. This effectively cut off the defence's reinforcements and the left flank was entirely exposed. This marked a turning point in the offensive and soon enough we took it.  This is what Verdun is all about. It's objectives are simple, attack and defend various points on the map with your squad, with the setting being war-torn france and the Western Front. Teamwork is crucial and most of the times you'll realise that just blowing yourself up with 3 more enemy soldiers won't help your team in the long run. You have 2 factions, Central Powers and Entente powers. The central powers are the Germans, and the Entente powers are the French, British and Canadians. Along with a good detail of historical accuracy, such as the beautifully functioning SMLE or the delicate yet sturdy K98 AZ, it also has late-war weapons such as the MP-18 submachine gun.  I was an Open Beta player for Verdun, ~2 years ago. To make it simple, There was only France and Germany, way fewer weapons and no gas warfare. Oh, and you could only have poilus or landsers. And there was no Gas warfare.  Speaking of Gas Warfare, one of the most unique experiences in gaming is just that. You have to carefully trudge around with a mask that impairs your visibility and gas that doesn't let you see anything more than 3 meters from you. It's scary, unique, and, to a messed-up sense, fun.  Verdun is a refreshing oasis in the desert of 'modern shooter' games. Personally, It brings me a sense of joy to see a unity game that I found on Kongregate grow to a sophisticated, stand-alone indie title. It, admittedly, has bugs but it's constantly being updated.  All in all, I'd reccomend you get this game, at least on sale. Gott mit uns!",

            "review_text": " Overview  Verdun is supposedly the first WWI FPS. Made by two indie companies with a total of three developers, while many think such low development wouldn't be successful, the game proves them wrong.   Presentation  Graphics in this game are superb, not many people expect much more out of an indie company. There are some graphic options in the menu however I wish there was just a bit more. Currently there are no sound controls, but the developers said they will add it in at a later date. As far as the battlefields go, they are rather spectacular, however somewhat bland. There is detail in every little part, with huge craters in no man's land, dead animals in the middle of no man's land barbed wire all over, it gives the player a feeling like they are actually experiencing WWI. Currently there are three maps, but I believe that they are working on adding more, all three look authentic and believable. However there are some drawbacks. Low frame rates haunt almost every player in this beta, while not unplayable it's more annoying, especially when you get killed because your fps dropped during the action. Hopefully this can be fixed before release. (UPDATE: Devs have released an update, upgrading their engine and fixing some lag, while I still experience some, it is minimized.) The menus are a bit buggy, but overall the devs have done a superb job on the visual side.   Gameplay  Gameplay is supposedly centered around you squad and your role in it. Yet with no current voice chat and little incentive to stay with your squad, your officer could be on the complete other side of the map and it would have no influence on your gameplay. However if you play with your friends and you really drive your squad based gameplay, it can actually help, turning your squad into a cruel fighting machine. This game has a leveling up system, your squad levels up with new uniforms and tech, and you have your own level, aswell as your rifles get leveled up. The leveling system needs some work as it doesn't seem like it is that responsive or effective. The main mode (or atleast what I presume is the main mode) is what their version of what the western front is. You get a set amount of time to storm the enemy trench with your team. If you can kill everyone in that trench and hold it for a set amount of time that is now your front line trench and you have to defend for the same amount of time. However if you are unsuccessful in storming the trench, you have about 30 seconds to retreat back into your trench and defend. If you don't make it back in 30 seconds you're deemed a deserter and are killed, but more on that later. I assume the gameplay is actually decently realistic, removing some factors, but is pretty fun. The other game mode is a rifle deathmatch. Basically it is a free for fall across the entire map. This is a great way to work out the maps and practice your rifling skills. One of the problems with this game is that you die way too much. It's easy to die in a normal game 30+ times. Some would call this being realistic and I get that, but at points it can just be annoying. Another aspect mentioned earlier is that if you go outside the area of the map the game wants you to be in you can be killed because you're 'abandoning'. If you go behind where you're supposed to, you are killed. If you leave you're trench and go forward when defending you are killed. If you're attacking and you go past their trench you are killed. This can get annoying, however it does push the WWI playstyle so it is not such a madhouse. Another annoying feature is how deadly the barbed wire is. One can simply run into them and die a few seconds later, I don't know how realistic this is, but it sure is annoying if you don't see it. The gameplay is fun, although I hope they optimize it more to make it a great game.   Multiplayer  This game is currently solely multiplayer, however the devs had mentioned in the forums they are looking to add a multiplayer mode with bots, which I really hope they do, just incase I can't play online. As far as online goes the players are actually extremely nice. The players on this game are no Dota players, they actually help you out, even if they are on the opposite team, and I've seen that the teams have joked around with each other creating a great environment. Most everyone in the forums are nice aswell, answering my questions and inviting me to play with them when I didn't even ask. I hope that this can remain true beyond it's release.   Extras  The devs are working on many things, they just released a nice Christmas update where there is a new Christmas map and you can throw snowballs at one another. This is a nice little addition, and unneeded, but it was nice of them to add it. The devs say that they will add more before release and I hope they can come through, The game is really spectacular for just three devs, and I look forward to more.   Summary  Verdun is a unique WWI first person shooter by a dedicated indie team that pulled it off with a great dynamic gameplay and different game modes. With a few minor drawbacks this is a great experience any first person shooter or history fanatic should checkout, and I know I'll be playing for awhile..",

            "review_text": "Outnumbered 3 to 8 the germans advancing unto us with there rifles straight and spirits high. Unfortunately for the Germans the three men in the trenches were Canadian.   (((Scroll all the way down for TL;DR version)))  But in all seriousness this game is one of the best fps shooters I have played. I initially thought that a game about trenches would be fairly boring due to its natures of staying in one spot for most of the time. This game however is non-stop action from start to finish where at first you defend your trench and then proceed with an attack. there is so much thought that goes into trench warfare.   For example:  -Mounting MGs in the right positions,  -placeing gas in the right places,  -when and where to bomb, -when to cross no mans land, -How to fight in the trenches, and the list goes on.  Pros: -Great Graphics -The sound in the game is amazing -instilled pride in me that i didnt even know I had -Gameplay is well polished  Cons(minor): -Some servers do tend to lag but it is very uncommon and not that big of a problem -Learning curve is a little steep but once you get going you'll be golden  I would also recommend playing this game with a bunch of your friends on skype or what have you because I find it to be a way better experience.  I highly recommend this game to anyone 10/10 would play again.  [[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[TL;DR]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]] Game is Amazing expecially with friends. well worth the price offered.

            "review_text": "I had been sitting in these trenches for what had felt like hours, maybe it was minutes, I couldn't tell. My squad and I were tasked with defending a spot on the German Third Line. I was with the French Army, I was only 20, dropped out of the University to join. I was waiting to spot something coming over those hills, anything at all. All you could see was the smoke on the horizon, and the distant sounds of gun and mortar fire. It was close to nightfall, all I had to eat was a stale piece of bread in the past 12 hours. It was almost pitch black when I saw something, I was almost positive it was something. I brought my Enfield up to my eyes to focus on that spot. My squad was spread to thin, I didnt know where they were, I was alone.  It had been 10 minutes since I heard anything. I was starting to think I was too tired, and was hearing things. Then I heard it again, the shuffle of something in the dirt, all my muscles tensed up. It was then when I saw the helmet, barely noticing it at all. The infamous german helmet, black and crowned with a spike. The man who came up looked as equally tired and hungry as me. I touched the cold trigger, it had been days since I last used it. The gun was loud, if I missed I would've died. I pressed the trigger, it hit something, he didnt go down. It hit the cannon behind him.  He looked up, right at my position. I went to pull my bolt back, and fire again. I knew I wouldnt miss again, the gun didnt fire it was jammed. I turned and ran, I had to get out of the trench. I turned the corner and stopped, I listened for any noises, I couldn't hear anything, I crouched and walked over to the ladder and climed out. I laid prone next to an abandoned wagon, it was destroyed probably by mortar fire. I laid there for the longest minutes of my life. My heart was still pounding and I thought it was screaming my position to the world. I saw the helmet again, around the same corner I was at just minutes ago. I waited for him to come around, I had a plan wait for him to pass, then shoot him from behind, he would never know, but instead he waited for hours. It was almost dawn, you could see the smallest glimpses of the sunlight.  I thought he left to report back to a much larger German force. I was ready to climb back in to my post, and write a report for my NCO. When he turned the corner, he just walked through, he was quiet, but seemed very unaware. He passed by, here was my chance to get him. I got up, and laid down, just then I felt a sharp piercing pain in my leg, I almost yelled. It was the barbed wire, it was everywhere in between trenches. He crouched to do something, he gave me time. I sat up to get my leg out, It was hard to get yourself out of barbed wire. I then got my arms stuck in it, I couldnt get my self out, I tried just pulling my limbs, It made my cuts deeper. I was quickly losing blood, I felt my life draining. I sat there staring at the sky, until death consumed me    10/10, would die from barbed wire again",

            "review_text": "Verdun! First looking at the trailers and such like half a year before writing this, i didn't think much of it, but i decided to give it a shot when it was on sale on christmas. And what a christmas it became....  TL;DR  Pros  +Epic atmosphere +Great core gameplay +Authenticity (To some extent) +MUSTARD GAS +Squad based gameplay  Cons  -Arcady BS elements (Such as hitmarkers, crosshairs, score/kill feed) (Disabling above mentioned BS (hitmarkers, crosshairs) will handicap you.) -No dedicated servers  And for those who want a little reading..!  -------------------------------------------------------------  Verdun has a truly epic atmosphere and it gives the player a true trench warfare experience. The game starts you off with some classic music from the era, and right from the start puts you in the right mood to crawl in mud attacking... Or to bitterly fight for every last inch of your trench.   So, instead of vague flags or areas, you're fighting for actual trenches and not just some 10x10 meter area on the map. The core gameplay is very simple and it WORKS. If you start off as the attacking team, your team will (hopefully) give its best shot at attacking the enemy trench and try to capture it. If the attack fails, you have to fall back to your trench and its the opposing teams time to attack. However, if you manage to capture the enemy trench, a counterattack will be ordered and you have to go from offensive to defensive really fast to keep it. In theory the whole match CAN be just one attack phase, if the attacking team is fighting fanatically enough, and the defenders holding ground steadfast.  All those times you've been THIS close to capturing the enemy trench, but you run out of momentum and have to fall back, is just what trench warfare is all about. I cannot put in words how satisfying it feels when capturing the enemy trench after a long stalemate of neither side gaining any victories, but then... You finally manage to do it and prepare for the enemy counterattack. And it feels really really good to take the enemy trench and If all goes well and you repulse the counterattack, then its time to put your skills to the test on the next trench.  However, the arcady crosshairs and kill feeds and all that scoregarbage eat this atmosphere away, but not enough to ruin the experience, atleast for me. Sure, you can disable the crosshair, or bind the whole hud under a button to show it, but this puts you at a disadvantage, so it would be just handicapping yourself. And for the love of god.... HIT MARKERS WHY???????? But overall, the gameplay is nice, it could be alot better if they had decided to nurture this atmosphere the game has AND REALISM, instead of the crap i mentioned just now.  It has leveling and whatnot too, but you can't get a dramatic boost over a noob with just the unlocks.... unless it's the squad unlocks. Squad level can only be raised by playing with your friends, over and over again, which is nice. The squad level can basicly turn your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ little mortars into a real artillery storm. Oh and you can unlock mustard gas, damn is that deadly.  Overall i'd give it a 7/10. It's very fun, Best enjoyed with friends!  See you in the trenches, comrades. And remember, Keep calm &amp; STELLUNG HALTEN!  I Might Write more to this review when i have the time :D",

What I have been playing (pretty much non-stop since i bought it!) was a highly squad-based, realistic, and addictive historical FPS. It really does capture the essence of the chaos in the trenches as well as the futility you will eventually feel every time you go over the top to charge the enemy trench. Charging at machine guns, rifles, and artillery fire to gain just a few metres of ground is a very different experience than any other game I've ever played. Anyways my pros and cons are:  Pros -Realistic maps, weapons, and shooting (no twitch fire, quickscoping, etc.) -Great squad play, if you do not play as a team player, you will die. Again. And. Again. -Sense of satisfaction from capturing the next trench and line and desperation as you start to lose it in the counter-attack  Cons -Maps are a bit too big for the team sizes, sometimes it feels as though there aren't enough people attacking or defending. This could be remedied with larger team sizes obviously, or NPC's. -Very odd squad progression system that sometimes carries on through matches and sometimes doesn;t, this is annoying especially when my mates and I are trying to get to the next level of uniform and upgrades.  Overall this is a very well made game that is definetly worth its price. I hope to see future updates adding more great content!  10/10 ",

It is 16 vs 16 divided into squads of four for the main game mode. Most weapons are one to two shot kills sometimes three depending on the range. The main goal is simple capture more trenches then the opposeing team in the 30 minute time limit or push the enemy team off the map. You most gain a foot hold in the enemies trench before the time limit runs out if you contiune to have one guy in the trench it will not call a retreat you have extra time to hold a majority number for a short amount of time. If you fail at this you will be put on the defence until the enemy team falls back or takes your trench and the bloody cycle begins anew. If you do decide for this game do not be discouraged when you die alot. What matter in the end is doing your job and winning the match.   Overall fun game I highly recomend it to anyone intrested in tatical shooters or WW1 history just be prepared to die jumping into the enemy trench alot.",

There are flaws and bugs, but I never met any that can force me out of game.  I recommend you to check the game out. ",

            "review_text": "Verdun is based in the tumultuous and incredibly bloody World War I, where trench warfare and the rise of the first tanks took place. The game takes you to various locals and humongous maps spanning the length of France. I have long been an admirer of history, and I must say that this game has not disappointed me in keeping to the period. To speak of the graphics, the game in it's earliest form was basic at the least. However, it has gone far from those nascent graphics and has blossomed into a grimy and bloody masterpiece of historical-based games. Gun models are very realistic and detailed, and include things such as serial numbers and maker's etchings for those that look closer than just the far sights. Uniforms, with the benefit of a scrupulous historical adviser and modeling team, are top notch and pleasant to the eye, as much as they are to the period. On top of these, much work has been done to detail every inch of maps with props and trenches that are again as if they were lifted right from the annals of time to be played by our more recent generation. Game play is formed to follow the manner of tactics used at the time, with the defending or assaulting of trenches, where the capturing of a trench by your team earns it one grueling, hard-won point. After such a minor victory has been achieved, you must then aid your team in defending your well-earned prize for a time before continuing on to the next trench or, failing that, being beaten back to start anew. In this, Verdun captures the essence of the period brutally, but beautifully. You are also able to have a variety of characters at your command that are chosen from a 'squad.' A squad, whether of the Central or Entente powers or factions, have four characters each to choose from, and are further broken down with three loadouts, two of which needing be unlocked via points that you are able to earn. Furthermore, team play is also very encouraged with the inclusion of squad voice chat and squad or team text chat, allowing you to alert your teammates to an incursion into your trench by the enemy. The deadliness of the period is also well represented by the ease with which your character can be brought down to a rather nasty end, whether it be through a bullet to the skull or a mortar round to your hapless, rag doll body. This being said, I must also mention that there are times when game play breaks down to rather nasty spamming of snipers or those that can and do use grenades to a pretentious amount, forcing the enemy team to also stoop to such levels or be annihilated. While this does happen on occasion, it is few enough times to not pose a very large problem, though one that does need some balancing in the hopeful future. Of the squads I mentioned earlier, you have seven to choose from between the two sides. Three belong to Germany, where you have the Stosstruppen, Landsers, and Alpenjagers. Another four of the Entente powers include the Canadians, 'Tommies,' Chasseurs Alpins, and Poilus. All of these have their own four variants of characters and three variants of loadouts, which add up to eighty-four different possibilities. For instance, each squad has a leader that can call down powerful artillery, noxious gas, or recon planes to give the location of enemies to you and your entire team. Or you can have machine gunners that lay down anything within their field of fire. More squad types are on the way according to the Verdun wiki, which should be very interesting in future gameplay, especially if they also were to include the Russian faction as well, though such a squad might have some internal dissention... In any case, with the exception of a few player-based hiccups, there is little that can be said against the game, besides the occasional problems for people to connect to friends at times, which could be a rather essential bug were it not to be addressed. I recommend yes for those that are looking into this game, as it is educational and fun for all that would play as a soldier of the muddy, frightening, maddening, grueling, and wonderful Verdun!",

I have to admit, in the beginning i did not really liked it(early access/alpha/beta/bugs/cluckyness etc), but something has changed....it has become a really good game.  Some people compare it to RO/RO2, i think thats true.   I recommend because: If you are interrested in World war 1. If you like similar games such a RO. (somewhat realistic, it is not extremely realistic though) If you like to level-up and progress. If you (like me) like trech warfare game modes of attack and defend and vica versa.   I do not recommend because: If you like quick run and gun FPS games. If you like extreme up to date graphics (personaly i care alot more about gameplay) If you don't like to die alot and quickly in a FPS game. If you don't care about history(WW1), and is only interrested in modern stuff.   I can recommend this game.

And 4 squads in team that has a role too — spotters, close quarters, supports. Finally someone made a true frontline game. Ain't this points that we see everywhere. Something fresh! Atmosphere is great. For a first time multiplayer game that depress you with fears and terrors of war. For real, I feel Remarque's spirit in this game.

Worthy game, especialy on sale. More stuff to come, watch xmas truce event — dat is gorgeous. ---- Update 16.01.15 Devs repolished engine, now it's Unity 5. New sound, animations, supression and shellshock features. ---- Update 27.10.15 Stability increased. Game came out from Early Access. So how it plays?   It's a son of Insurgency + Red Orchestra 2. Better then Insurgency but not so polished like RO2. U got no tanks here on the battlefield and only 32 players. Weapons are good, you feel them. Game has it's own atmosphere of trench's warfare. Frontline mode -- first you attack then you hold. Devs cut the nerve -- you really feel the insanity of war. You keep dying trying to reach trench, then you got to fall back and it's infinite. I read Remarque's book about WWI and it's really that feel.   But if you pass this period you will get E.Junger experience. You will start love that insanity. Trench's massacre, close quarters battle rage.  Also each map is different. In 1914 it's more about rifle shootings, in 1918 -- class quarters in trenches.  + Weapons + Well designed historical clothes + Balance -- you need to teamplay + Frontline mode + Devs learn a lot about WW1 + Speed Bolting  = Not for everyone.   - Glitch sometimes - Only 32 players - Bad VoIP - No tanks, cars.   I'm looking forward that Devs will continue shape and add new features like they did in early access. Great road from more mode than game to Insurgency 2 level game.  05.12.15 Fixed review.

Entente Powers and Central Empires are divided in squads (4) each with their own abilities and roles, and each squad is divided into roles (4), each with their own weapons and charateristics, bonuses and maluses (32 players in total may seem few, but trust me, there's a lot of action going on all the time if both armies are full). Each squads also has an NCO providing forward spawn points, artillery, gas attacks, def/atk bonuses and whatnot, depending on the squad you're in. You start with basic equipment, and you can unlock more advanced one with experience points gained on the battlefield. Teamwork is highly valued and encouraged. In fact, highly teamworking teams will be awarded with several bonuses and better armour. Balancing system is extremely clever and fitting, too. Voting system is cool as well.

The reality of trench warfare is brought to life in vivid detail, from the obliterated landscape, to the murderous modern weapons, to the disorienting gas attacks since outlawed, everything about this game feels authentic to how a real WWI front-line engagement would have been fought, and it's awesome!   Verdun abandons the mindlessness of the twitch-shooter in favor of a more tactically-minded approach. Alone, you are quite under-powered, since the sluggish weapons mean you're likely to get yourself killed if you take on the enemy alone. Only with teamwork, by multiplying your force, can you hope to overcome the enemy. Thankfully, Verdun presents players with plenty of ways to do that.   In Frontlines, the game's flagship mode, the Entente and Central powers are divided into various squads of 4. Each squad is unique and each of the 4 squad members has a unique role. Oh, and if you were thinking of picking a weapon off someone dead, forget it. You're stuck with the weapons you have. It's easy to see how players with a more competitive mindset could take advantage of the potential strengths of various squads to create a strong all-around force.   All of that would be useless if the game mode weren't as well designed as it is. You will attack the enemy line, then hold it or fall back depending on the outcome. The attack will then be stalled until the enemy counter attack has been dealt with. (This is enforced through automatic execution for desertion should you remain outside the boundaries the game has set for too long.) These attacks are desperate sprints across no man's land; trying to avoid rifle and machinegun fire. Defense can be equally terrifying should smoke or gas cloud your vision, making it almost impossible to distinguish friend from foe in the trench, (though I will criticize the lack of friendly fire, which would have made these moments feel more tense.) It's not uncommon for matches to end in a draw. Overcoming an enemy position and holding it can be difficult indeed.   As for the other modes, there is a squad defense mode where a player squad fights off endless waves of progressively stronger bot attackers, in a way that invokes my memories of Call of Duty Zombies, but without turning the enemy into bullet sponges. Players can take more hits here without dying, and with only 4 players, the battles have much less lag relative to Verdun's massive 16v16 multiplayer modes. (i recommend a strong internet connection to play the game on ultra graphics, the way it was intended, but lower options exist of course.)   There's also a team deathmatch mode, which I haven't played much yet as I haven't played enough of the game to unlock a more suitable set-up. (It seems to be exactly what you'd expect; getting kills is the only thing that matters, so teamwork is less important here.) Overall, it feels a lot more stale than Frontlines. Finally, there is rifle-only deathmatch, which is another great mode for newer players to get more accustomed with the most common weapon-type in the game. It is here I must say Verdun's weapon diversity is one of its strongest pros, and a breath of fresh air considering so many gamers believed for so long, (and so many still do,) creating a fun shooter experience in a setting saturated with bolt-action rifles was impossible. Let me assure you now, Verdun did it. Weapons feel unique, and useful in their own ways.   The only con I can think of is the steep learning curve. Considering the setting was largely ignored by developers, and that the war itself happened over 100 years ago, WWI seems completely alien today. It comes as no surprise that players have a hard time adjusting then. Some light reading on how the real soldiers fought could help, and there is an official guide covering the game on the Steam forum. However, there doesn't seem to be any in-game tutorial to speak of, unless you count the slideshow of sorts when I started the game for the first time that did little but explain the most basic details, and lasted less than a minute.   Even so, Verdun surpassed my expectations. I thought it would more or less be a Red Orchestra 2 clone; realistic to the detriment of fun, but I've had way more fun playing this than I did RO2. Take it from a Call of Duty fan (before CoD lost its way.) If you like historically grounded shooters, this game manages to feel both authentic and fun to play. Also, at the price, ($12.50 for me thanks to the summer discount,) your wallet will thank you for all the DLC you won't have to buy.",

            "review_text": "  Although I've only played 9 or so hours at the time of me writing this review, I can confidently say that this is one of the best FPS games that I've ever played.  In my eyes, it is only matched by games like Insurgency. Other than that not many other games come close to the immersiveness and inventiveness that this game brings to the table.  As an amateur historian and lover of all things war history, it is really refreshing to see a very well done video game about WW1. To take that point even further, it is great to see a WW1 game be done with incredible historical accuracy, unlike a certain AAA title that is coming out in a few months...  From a technical standpoint, I'm playing this game on a ♥♥♥♥♥♥, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ laptop, and I can still get decent framerates and nice textures. So I would have to say that it is well optimized. I have yet to come across any technical difficulties as well. No glitches or bugs.  I would also like to add that the community is very nice and welcoming. Everyone is a team player. No trolls or asshats. Everyone is immersed in the game and makes it a nice experience.  Dim the lights, put on a good pair of headphones, and prepair yourself mentally to get PTSD from this realistic depiction of war that seemingly lives up to, and pays rememberence by simply existing to a collossal point in history.  9.5/10",

Only to be laid into by a massive artillery barrage that the enemy had called on to their own position... I saw my comrade at arms hit the dirt as around him my entire squad disintegrated into bloody parts flying through the air, landing in the hellish mud.   This barrage of hell just barely over.. the enemy counter attacked to regain their trench... I watched as, in an instant - my battle comrade, who had survived MG fire, grenades, artillery barrages and fought through the enemy line... was killed. By a lunatic armed with a f*cking Spade.  A Spade.   I knew my death was imminent, but putting a bullet through the mad spade wielding, comrade killing lunatic made it all worth it.  This game is hell. This game is awesome.",

It does an ok job of doing this but there is always a sense that the potential is far greater than the current experience.  Graphics are functional but dated, the squad system is good but not intuitive. The thing that will frustrate you the most (apart from the ever prevelant bugs) is the very thing that is pivital to the game - running over no mans land and dying again and again in order to get a glimpse of the enemies trench.   Although released at the end of April 2015, it still feels a little unfinished with bugs and poor optimisation. The devs were active but I would say seem less active after release (which is understandable). The test will be if they can continue to polish and add content to the game and take it forward incrementally to take it from an ok game to a really great game. Whether they have the time and effort do so will remain to be seen.  In it's current state however, it's worth picking up on sale if you are a fan of FPS, if only to experience something a little different.   Overall Score:  6.5/10   The Good:   Interesting and unuique WWI FPS theme   If you have a good team you can get some really good matches   The Bad:    Dated visuals   Bugs   Content feels limited at the moment (bring on the tanks!)

The maps are surprisingly diverse considering the setting, though for being named 'Verdun' there aren't as many sprawling forts as you'd expect.  There is room for improvement in the squad system (which is far from intuitive) and the way the game deals with team balance.  While I play and enjoy a range of games set in historical and current day conflicts, this of all I felt the most uncomfortable about, which is odd.

The enemy began to retaliate by typing 'oldmacdonald had a farm, e i e i o' Then dildomonster called in arty on them. It stopped there singing. We held off the enemy until our team could take the trench.  10/10 would follow dildomonster into battle again.

Do I enjoy it? why yes, yes I love this game, because this game offers a really fun experience and new 'challenge' or enviorment to play in. So far this is the best WW1 shooter I have seen and it is a good hardecore game. My only issues with this game which makes me want to smash my moniter is that this game (at least from my experience) is that either the netcode or something at times is bad. When I am hiding behind a wall, I get shot no matter what because on that persons screen I was standing, or when I shot someone they dont get hit. But thats all, if you dont have it just get it, its a cheap game and why not? very fun with friends :P",

            "review_text": "I bought this game during this year's summer sale to experiment with my friends, and it ended up becoming my favorite shooter by far, even beating out long-time runners BF3 and CoD: MW. There's just something to be said about the harsh struggles of the First World War, with almost every weapon capable of killing in just a single bullet.  The weapons are almost perfectly balanced, with perhaps the exception of the infamously mediocre Chauchat (I personally enjoy using it, though maybe not as much as the Lewis), and the asymmetrical maps offer each side an equal number of yet different vantage points and killboxes. In addition, the models are very accurate, though as Ian of ForgottenWeapons, who plays this game, will tell you, the French rifles have a slight error in their sight pictures.  This game is a high-risk, high-reward team-based game. The individual can accomplish much, but without any communication many games devolve into giant stalemates, alternating between attacking and defending. That being said, even a single squad communicating within itself is enough to turn the tide, and if one manages to get the entire team on voice chat they would be nigh unstoppable. Even a single machine gunner with enough cues from his comrades is enough to suppress the entire enemy team, forestalling their advance until the next phase.  Of course, every game has its downsides. For all its gameplay features, joining games with your friends is a little bit of a hassle. On the lower-populated AU server, it is nigh impossible to get your private squad into a game, instead having to rely on joining an already-existing squad and hoping no randoms join. The visuals are not something you would consider modern, and combined with some choppy animations sometimes the game looks clunky.  On the whole, though, Verdun is a fresh breath into a market saturated with head-turning, three-dimensional twitch shooters and gritty military simulators, introducing both a unique setting and simple yet appropriate mechanics. I heartily recommend this game.  9/10",

It seemed as if our advance was doomed to fail.  That is until a member of my squad pulled out a massive bundle grenade primed it and screamed 'ALLAHU AKBAR!' before climbing over the lip of of the shell hole and rushing the enemy position. By some stroke of luck despite all the enemy bullets flying our way none hit him and he dove into the enemy line.  The massive explosion that happened a second after that killed no less than 6 enemy players and of course our crazy bomber, it also left a large gap in the enemy team's defensive line that I wasted no time exploiting with the rest of the squad. The rest of our team spilled in the gap moments later and few seconds after that the line was ours.  From that point on in the match every time enemies dared to clump up I let my squad's unofficial suicide bomber do his duty, he'd even charge out of bounds just to reach groups of enemy players massing for counter attacks on our newly held lines, and so our victory was secured.  19/15 would shamelessly sanction Jihadist suicide tactics again to ensure team's victory.",

When defending, everyone lines up on the trench to drop anyone charging forward to stop them from capturing. Expect to sit in a trench for a long time killing people as bodies fill the trench.   When attacking, expect the same treatment from your enemies. You need to hop from crater to crater to make it to their trenches to capture it. If you fail to capture it in time, you will need to retreat in time so you aren't executed. The game has a system that are basically killzone if you are in them for to long.

The adrenaline rush you recieve when lodging a round from your Gewehr into their chest and felling them.  Or playing as an NCO(use pistols usually and call in artillery[smoke,shell,gas] to suppress thy enemy) when you lodge 2 bullets into someone as they charged you and drop dead in front of you. This game is very satisfying when you get kills is what i'm trying to say. To me, that's what makes this game great and fun to play.  FYI this game is squad based! You will pick a battle to go to and from there, you will choose the Entente side or the Central side. As far as I know, each side's squad leaders' can choose from the numbers of different types of troopes that were at the battle of Verdun. So, if you're on Central Powers, you can choose from U.S. Doughboys (U.S. Army), Marines, etc. I am personally really enjoying the Doughboys.

At this point, there where 3 of us left on the lobby, and two of us were constantly dying from suicide (according to the game). The other player ;eft the lobby after his 10th death. but i refused to go out like this!, suddenly the remaining user (who hasnt died from suicide) tells me that he has a away to restore my terrain, and I said 'how?'. The man replied ' I can rstore your terrain, IF you answer me this. I reply shivering with fear 'Okay?', the man simply said 'Do you like Fish Sticks?'. And as I contemplated whether or not I truly did enjoy the seafood of question, I quickly said yes to get my terrain back. The man says 'So your a gay fish?' and my terrain was restored. Still to this day I think back to that horrible match the end.",

            "review_text": "I lay in the trenches of the german first line listening to the mortars drop and the machine gun bullets wizzing by over my head. I take brief pod shots at the enemy line but have a hard time seeing anything through the grime and smoke. Then I hear an all too familair sound.....Für das Vaterland! Attacke! Attacke! Our NCO had just ordered us to charge the enemy lines and seeing that spreading cloud of chlorine gas on the horizon sure dident help puersuade the descision. I briefly considered shooting myself in the foot or hiding behind our line somewhere but what real soldier would do that?   'Screw it' I thought, and with that I bounded up out of the trenches and proceeded to run for my life hearing noise of war and whistle of bullets all around me. Knowing if I hesitated now, even for a second, I would most likely end up facedown in the mud. Reminding myself of the noise variances akin to bullets, A hiss means its close but a snag means its a near miss. If you hear the latter then you better hit the ground like a fat man chasing a doughnut.   Needless to say the next several minutes are a blurr of mud, screams, and smoke. Seeing several of my comrades fall in front of me and not get up again, knowing I might soon be joining them I close the bolt on my Grewher 98 as I get close enough to the enemy line to see heads moving about. Several of my fellows in a foxhole beside me raise up to run into the enemy trench which lay devestated from artillery fire, I notice movement in front of me. Several brits had rose up to take shots at my allies. I expose myself out of my fox hole and pick them off using 3 of my 5 shots earning myself 4 kills, as one of my bullets had went through my enemies neck and into his NCO behind him, I see my friends scramble into the trench all safe from the horrors of No Mans Land. Then I see more movement on my right and turn to see the barrel of a MG sticking out amonst the sandbags. I close my eyes muttering a curse under my breath and accept my fate as I hear the sound of the machine gun open fire.  I reopen my eyes and find myself back in the trench I had just fought my way out of just to do it all over again. Except now the enemy was charging us.  9/10 would die for my friends again  P.S.

            "review_text": "It's alright, I mean it has it's good moments and bad moments. The things I find great about this game is the atmosphere and that it's one of the few games that stands out of the sandbox of modern warfare clones, and creates a World War I game that has very immersive feel to it. I like the gameplay and how it feels more realistic than an arcade like game, e.g Modern Warfare/Battlefield series. The graphics are great, and my midrange rig can handle it at a steady 50-70 FPS on settings mostly on high/ultra in 1920x1080. And the music and sounds are absolutely awesome.  However, there are a few issues that just make the game feel kinda repetative, the user interface can be a little mind boggling for the first ten minutes, but you get over it fairly quick. And the multiplayer games feel kinda barren, I find it kinda disappointing when you can only find games with 6v6 or at most 12v12 on maps that are meant to host many more players, while this isn't the fault of the core game it is a problem I have encountered from the past few times I've played it in the past two days. One issue I encountered was the spawn issue, I hated spawning and instantaniously killed and then having to wait 15-30 seconds only to have it happen again, I also encountered times where the enemy would spawn right in front of me. There are few glitches though, though the only ones I've encountered is getting hurt by barbed wire several times when I wasn't anywhere near it.   Over all it's a good game if you want a good WW1-esque experience and fun realistic type of shooter, pick it up. Definitely was worth the 12$ I spent on it during the sale.",

            "review_text": "Red orchestra meets insurgency. For information I have been playing red orchestra since 2006. I played insrugency when it was an hl2 mod.  I would say this game manages to innovate on some points and is a fresh addition to the genre.  It has better graphics and atmosphere than red orchestra 2.  For example the game menus and loading screens are cool and reinforces the atmosphere. I think more games should do that.   Better bolt action control. They made a really good job of creating a fun game with the weapons available for that era.  Faster gameplay. Can be intense and epic, more than RO2 (at least on vanilla maps). Combat mechanics are good and I prefer them over RO2. But playing requires more attention! It can be tiring. It's probably easier to have long game sessions of RO2 than Verdun.  Teamplay is more important, which can be frustrating if the enemy knows how to exploit the game mechanics. No reinforcement counter which is sad IMO. So being good at killing isn't rewarded as much.  Smaller maps. I think it is due to the engine's limitations (Unity) and the will to have a crowded battefield. Smaller max player count (32 vs 64).  Smaller community (but it is possible to find full servers in Europe when needed).  Overall I think it is a more polished product than RO2 with nice attention to detail. However both game are different enough so Verdun doesn't replace RO2.  I highly recommand this game, a great FPS!    P.S. battefield 1 sucks",

With the majority of your enemies wielding one-shot kill weapons, running and gunning isn't very effective, and forces you to use terrain and your enemies' locations to the best of your ability.

You'll be happy you took so many down with you, and it is very satisfying indeed.  But the best part has to be the teamwork in this game, covering eachothers backs, going in as a four man squad with different weapons, roles and equipment. The NCO can place artillery, gas or recon and places orders to gain points for his squad.  If you like bolt-action rifles, which I do, this is definitely your game. Even the pistols are mighty in this game and really fun to use. I cannot wait for the C96 and more!  The only downside to this game is the balance, while there is a penalty for the team who has more player on it, sometimes people just refuse to play fair. Sometimes you're forced to play 6 versus 12, or 4 versus 7. But worry not! All you have to do it leave that particular server and press the matchmaking button and you're off to a- hopefully- better matchup.

The gameplay is brutal and unforgiving, but hey, this is war! I love how the game doesn't make it 'arcady' or easy. This makes it all the more rewarding when you get to kill someone.

            "review_text": "Verdun is a great game for anyone who is a fan of Military games and the First World War but is willing to play a more realistic game than battlefield 1.  GOOD POINTS  The devs have put enormous effort into player models and the maps but also they taken care to have distinctive classes for each nation even if some are clearly better in battle. The game runs smooth and looks amazing at max graphics however i would warn players with bad computers that the experience wont be the same because at lower graphics setting the game doesnt look that good. One thing i enjoy is the one shot- one kill approach the devs have taken which is a refreshing break from games such as Battlefield or Call of Duty where it takes several shots to kill a player.  BAD POINTS I have a few problems with the game however they are not massive. The first one is that at certain times during the day it is hard to find servers with many players in. This therefore doesnt make you want to play the game as much. The second problem is that the respawn times on this game can be as high as 25 seconds which is a very long time to wait. Also i think the core gameplay would benefit from variety in objectives while playing because in the main gamemode you can spend a very long time just advancing, then retreating, then advancing again without that much enjoyment. It would be nice for side quests maybe.  OVERALL To conclude i think Verdun is a very good game for a reasonable price in the steam store and it is highly underrated as a game and i feel like it deserves a higher user base. It has a dedicated userbase and if you enjoy slower, more tactical combat this is the game for you.",

The gameplay is fun and enjoyable and I really feel that it simulates trench warfare perfectly! And I like how every team has to do a bit of defence and offence in the games with One team attacking and the other defending, and I also like how each teen takes turns doing a defence and attack during a game, and I also love the kneeling and crawling controls, these controls allow you to move around the map within cover, and the weapons feel very nice to use and it allows you to take logn range Shots, and I also love how each team has more than one trench to catcher, or fall back into.  Verdun is a very good game but every game has its flaws, I don't like how you can't tell where your grenades most likely going to land instead you have to try your best to hit your mark, and I also don't like how there is a severe lack of a tutorial on how to play the Game, and I also don't like how when you are in a cloud of poisonous gas it says in the text that you are in a cloud of gas, but it doesn't tell you to press 4 to put on your gas mask, and I also don't like how the in game chat, is in the top right corner instead of the bottom left corner like I'm used to having it in Mountain and blade, and I also don't like how ANZAC soldiers, have not been add to this game yet, we New Zealanders Fort in this war to!  Despite its flaws Verdun is definitely a game worth getting, and it has the EMPERORS sticker of approval, You definitely must pick up this game before the Steam sale ends tomorrow!  ",

            "review_text": "I have had this game since October of 2013, and let me tell you right off the bat: this game has improved beyond anything i ever imagined! The graphics, the gameplay, the adjustments, everything! All of these things combined have made it one of the most enjoyable World War One First Person Shooter games i have ever played.   It is a new genre, in my opinion: you cannot use conventional tactics from games such as Red Orchestra, Call of Duty, or even any of the Battlefield games! So be advised that when you first enter the game, it may be frustrating simply because you need to apply new tactics in order to be successful in this World War 1 environment.  This brings me to my second point: do not get frustrated! Instead, look for dangers before they hit...mostly artillery. You can look to the skies and see the streaks of the shots coming down, and you can determine where they will land. If you don't have time to do this, just listen for the distinguishable sounds as they are shot from the artillery pieces off map. Also, do not poke your head out of the trench for too long: you WILL be shot. This, i have come to find, is what frustrates people the most, and it is simply because they have not adjusted to the type of warfare that Verdun, as a game, offers.   Each step is a new obstactle in this game (quite literally!) You may find yourself caught behind an extensive barbed wire fence that you need to get around, or you may be caught of guard and fall into ankle wire only to be picked off by a sniper. Machine guns are deadly in this game as they were in real life: so make sure you are always watching for their flashes so you can get rid of them! Probably two of the most feared obstactles in this game are grenades and artillery. Use them to your benefit, and learn to fear them when they are being wielded by the enemy!  If you follow all of these steps, you will be able to take some time to look at the beauty of the game. They have added in such little details such as dugouts in the sides of trench walls where you can see beds, to little things scattered around the trenches (pots, pans, ammo, boxes, ect.) One of the most beautiful things to watch is an assault. Of course it is not delightful in real life, but being that this IS a game, you will find some epicness in sitting back and watching people run head first to their death.   All and all, i must say that i fell in love with this game at first glance: and i really did just glance at it! It didn't look very promising, but i promise you that these developers, even though they are a small team, know how to make a fun, exciting, and interactive game! I cannot express how much i have enjoyed Verdun: even through all of the hurtles which have made the game frustrating. It is truly a gem, and seeing now the road map for 2015 has gotten me even more excited for what is yet to be implemented into the game!  I definitely recommend this game to any tactical FPS enthusiast, History geek, and people looking for a fun exhilerating ride!  8.5/10!",

            "review_text": "Verdun is a very tough but fun ww1 Multi Player shooter, it has a nice selection of historical maps from the Verdun Front line that are both horrifying to fight in and beautiful to look at. The game play is solid, and there is serious feeling behind the weapons, getting a kill is very satisfying in this game, managing to nail a few enemy soldiers in a row with a rifle makes you feel like a god! The atmosphere is fantastic and i think its captured the feeling of ww1 very nicely.  It took me a while to get used to the different loadouts for different squads, but i got used to them in the end, and there is a nice variation of weaponry for said classes depending on your squad, which means you are not using the same old rifle match after match.   Ive seen a handful of minor animation glitches and the learning curve is hard, you will die a lot, especially in your first few games, but you will get better and be patient, very patient. Only real issue i have is with the machine guns which need fixed as i dont know how many times ive seen enemy soldiers charge down a trench firing frop the hip and kill 6 or 7 soldiers in a row with seemingly no recoil, and yet if you try and shoot back whilst near them the suppression effect on your aim is ridiculously extreme and makes it near impossible to kill them.  In short, a very well done game that is quite fun to play, has a few small glitches and bugs (only experienced two game drops, one unexplained the other because my internet cut off) little lag in matches and overall just very fun to play. The weapons and attention to detail in the environments and uniforms is spectacular, and boy is it tense to battle in the midst of a gas cloud.  edit: only got a few hours in so if i change my thoughts on something or want to add more ill just come back to it.",

Okay, so, a disclaimer here: I am a huge WW1 buff. I am thoroughly obsessed with “The Great War”. So right off the bat Verdun earns a special place in my heart. Even though I generally don’t play multiplayer shooters, I love Verdun because of what it accomplishes. The game transports you right into the bleak hellscape of the western front. Almost everything about this game is downright perfect. From the weapons to the classes to the back and forth nature of trench warfare, where the advantage always lies with the defender, the game is as wonderful as can be. There is nothing like running across no man’s land, watching your teammates be mowed down by machine gun fire, trying to make it into that crater for cover. Nor is there anything like the adrenaline rush of standing knee-deep in filthy water in a godforsaken trench, seeing frantic movement in the distance – the rifleman to the left of you falls, your commander calls in a mortar shot, and suddenly the entire trench is filled with posion gas. You have to struggle to put on your flimsy gas mask, and over the sound of your own labored breathing you can hear them coming. Verdun is like no other first person shooter I’ve ever played, multiplayer or otherwise. If you are a fan of the bloated genre, you owe it to yourself to pick up this game and experience an entirely new form of warfare. If you’re interested in World War 1, then this is a no brainer. So come visit the western front, won’t you? The trenches are lovely this time of year.",

It's a good idea and manages to impart the WW1 'slow advance/meat grinder' element that is absolutely critical to WW1 media. It keeps things entertaining with a really well thought out squad system (different types of squads get different classes, which means different weapons and abilities). The maps are for the most part very well done and look excellent, with only one bad map in my opinion that just isn't any fun.  There are only two real negatives to this game in my opinion, and those are: 1, the Rifleman class gets a scope for his rifle, so you're going to see people climbing over each other for one of those. When somebody is using it they are going to kill you over, and over, and over, and there isn't a damn thing you can do about it. So much of this game is reliant on ironsights and close-up panicked shots, or the squinty-eyed 'I wonder if I can hit him at this range' Hail Mary, that that one scope manages to really unbalance things. I understand you need to pander to the MLG 360 noscope crowd in order to get FPS sales in this day and age but it's really jarring, detracts from the experience and isn't fun. And secondly, spawn-camping happens on the regular, and the maps aren't structured well enough to stop a determined scrub from camping your spawn with an MG and decimating you. All may be fair in war, but it's bull and it isn't fun to try and get back against those tools.  All in all though it's a wicked game, it's got a free expansion coming and you should be playing it right now.",

It's partly due to the hitboxes don't always work, and you simply die when you're shot it can feel like you shouldn't have died.

            "review_text": "So, because the developers tell me to everytime I quit the game, I'm writing my review for Verdun. I wasn't too sure what to expect when I bought this game. It was half price and had been looking into it for a little bit, and I have to say that I'm very happy with it. It feels very different to other FPS games that I have played but there is something about it which keeps me playing it. For one thing, it is one of the few WW1 games that exists, (yes I know BF1 is coming out soon) which has a huge impact on the weapon variety. There are basically, rifles, LMGs and some old-timey pistols, and when it comes to choosing which one to use, it normally depends on which one looks the coolest, because all the guns seem to do the same damage as each other. 1 shot for rifles, 2 shots for LMGs, 3 shots for pistols and 1-2 shots for revolvers. Having said that, I like the guns in the game. They're not guns that we're normally used to in FPS', and in looking into the guns in real life, I've learnt some history.  The maps are pretty good. There are plenty for what the game is. My fav is Dauauauauaumont, (or however it's spelt) mainly because of the fortification part if the map. Other maps, are not so great, and this is mainly due to No man's land. Some maps seem to have a lack of cover, and seeing as some of these players have aimbotting accuracy, I normally end up dead before i've decided which leg I should use to start running with.  Community is very very good indeed. No hackers for one thing. And no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. But this is probably due to the lack of communication. The only people that can hear you via mic are people in your squad, but there's only 4 players per squad. Nethertheless, Verdun is a teamwork game, and fortunatly, the community seem thrilled to work as a team. There is no friendly fire as well, which for this game is perfect. I dread to think of my fellow rifleman stabbing me in the back with his bayonet because it's 'banter.'  The game is pretty damn realistic as well. There was an update a while back that allowed players limbs to be shot and blown off, making it rather entertaining for everyone. And the shooting mechanics are decent. I'd rather the game didn't go for the CS:GO approach of things, where moving heavily decreases accuracy, an when youre using a bolt-action rifle 75% of the time, this can be annoying.   Because my fingers are getting pins and needles from intense typing, I'll make my last point about gameplay. It's pretty simple. The teams have to defend their trench whilst the other team attacks it and tries to capture it. If they succeed, then you are pushed back a trench and have to attack the one they're in. If you defend you're trench for long enough, you have to attack their trench. And this goes on for about 20 minutes per game depending on how good your team is.  I'd give this game an 8, simply because it deserves it, and it is a game that more people need to play.",

IMHO:   Where Verdun succeeds is two-fold.   First, the graphics are not cartoon-like, as they tend to be in so many other WWI games, or even FPS's. The motion of aiming is slightly laborious, as it would be were you to be lugging around a heavy firearm, fighting trench warfare and trying to not die every moment of your day. The lighting of the game is glorious, with the shadows being a major component to the visual realism. I had the distinct pleasure of hiding in a destroyed tank's shadow while trying to lay down fire and not die! Didn't work out so well, but it did lend to my immersion of the battlefield experience.   Second, the sounds on the battlefield are very interesting. The guns have their own 'life', lent through not only the operation (reloading, bolt action, etc.) of the weapon, but the sounds it makes in said operation. I get the distinct impression the creators of the game went to some pain to ensure the sonds were 'true', if not unique. I am reminded of BF1942, in which the creators went to similar extents, and we know how that effort paid off! Also, the changes of sounds of footfalls from dry ground to wet/muddy ground really brings me into the experience.   Verdun is not perfect (yet), but its designers are continually making it better, and for that I say THANK YOU for a job well...progressing [done comes later]!",

On June 20th, 2016 at roughly 3am I will hijack a QANTAS plane departing Perth Airport for Bali, Indonesia. I will smuggle in a 3D printed pistol I had disassembled, placed in a bag and had swallowed earlier to prevent detection. Roughly 20 minutes into takeoff I will enter the in-flight bathroom, produce the bag from my stomach, assemble it, and exit the bathroom. I will then enter the cockpit and place the pistol against the head of the pilot. If the pilots are uncooperative or any person attempts to disarm me, I will shoot the pilots and attempt to take control of the plane myself, if this is impossible I will quickly pull down on the joystick, plunging everyone onboard to their deaths. However, if the pilots do cooperate, or I am able to take control of the plane, we will fly directly to a predetermined secret location in the Philippines where my group will take all remaining passengers hostage. After this a video of demands will be posted onto Facebook, Youtube, Vimeo and Dailymotion through multiple accounts. If our demands are not met within 48 hours, 10 passengers will be executed and a video of their executions posted onlines. Every hour after this will result in another 10 passengers being executed until the demands are met.  The game suffers from stuttering issues and a few minor bugs but aside from that, it's quite fun.",

First of all, i gotta say that your way of thinking about the frontline in a game like this is one of the best i experienced (i make refference to that map, a pretty new idea). I like that you struggled to keep the historical facts like they really were: original weapons, classes, uniforms, and many others...  Graphics: are good...for the beta version of the game, but I guess you will reserve some time to improve that.  IN TERMS OF GAMEPLAY AND ITS MECHANISMS... Sincerely, you have a lot to work! Let me just to enumerate some elements that I could not OVERLOOK in terms of REALISM facts ( i hope you know that this is the main attraction for historical based games like this) :   - I noticed that after firing, for example, 2 bullets with a rifle and closing the bolt, when you reload, you actually pull the bolt again , evacuating the 3rd bullet from the rifle's magazine...and as you probably guessed, to fully reload (5 bullets) we must introduce 3 more bullets, not just 2 !!!! TIP: add a manual bolt option.  - If we talk about bolt action rifles let's emphasize more details: I used a bolt action rifle in real life and belive me: you cannot pull it, evacuate the cartridge, and then closing it in 0.25 seconds like i saw in this game. It is RIDICULOUSLY fast and i noticed when doing that the rifle is holded down the sight! Are you serious?!  - When I threw a grenade I could not belive my eyes! It seemed like a levitation not like a real grenade throw, and there is no rolling on steep surfaces.  - Less RECOIL than normal.  - A fact that stunned me is lack of bulled delay...Guys we speak about a 2014 FPS not about Counter Strike that is made 12-14 years ago. Everyone I talked noticed that.  - When we speak about long ranges, the gravity is an agent that really affect the bullet's path...It smoothly tends to ground.  - In WW1, bayonet charges were very common actions...Why you forgot that?? you could also add an option to remove/attach bayonet on rifle and let use decide how to play.  - TANKS: I know tanks were not as comon in trench war as later in WW2, but this period/war is the pioneer of first tanks. Wouldn't be cool to add this stuff? Following Red Orchestra 2 example.  - Aim and switching between guns are TOO FAST. COME ON!!! Those characters are supposed to be humans, not robots!  - There is no friendly fire.  - You should create the posibility to pick up weapons and grenades from fallen soldiers.  Guys, I really understand you are working hard on this game, but please, you must do anything you can to attract many players because i sustain your concept. A radical improvement is essential!!! DO NOT BE AFRAID to revolutinize and continuous improvement!  GREETINGS!",

There is so much to be learned in this game, but the hard work will pay off in kills and how many times you're mentioned on the scoreboard. If you were sick of playing as a certain squad member, you can liven things up by trying a new position or try a new loadout.

And sure, sometimes you just sit there, waiting as sweat rolls down your forehead for the attack order to come. Then, the whistle blows, and you charge with all the speed you can muster!  And then a cheap freakin' mortar comes right on your head and you repeat.  But that's the fun in it.   10/10 would get blown to bits again",

The game (in my opinion) is incredible. Because it shows what warfare was like in the trenches, plus the weapons are super accurate to their real life versions. The game is well done and the graphics are amazing. Now thinking it, I can't think of anything bad about the game! it's that good. Overall I would recommend this game to any FPS lover, Historian, or just anyone at that matter. This game costs £17.00 ($26.73). If you had the money, I would recommend getting this game.

Graphics are solid, I am running on ultra settings with my GTX 660 at 70fps average.   The squad system is simple and fun to play with, and the class system is easy to level up and gives a wide range of weapons and tools. Wanna be a sniper and troll unsuspecting runners? Yep got that. Wanna be a camper and mow people down with a machine gun? Yeah got that too. Wanna run screaming across no-man's land with a shovel? HECK YEAH!   There are two gamemodes, Frontlines and Rifle Deathmatch. Frontlines is a tactical nightmare of trenches, explosions, and countless snipers. You really need to think while you fight, or you WILL die fast. A little advice, stay low, keep your head down, stay with your mates, stay low, and did I mention? STAY LOW. Basically just prone the whole time :P.  You shouldn't go anywhere near Rifle deathmatch until you are comfortable with the game, if you just jump in there with no experience, you are basically a free kill for all the l33t snipers.  Ok I guess I have to throw some cons in here somewhere....  Gameplay is a little confusing to start with, and there is no in-game tutorial, just a steam pop-up with a TON of reading.  Picking out enemies on the battle field is seriously hard to master unless you are a god at finding tiny unmoving snipers across the map...

This is one of the best shooters I've played in a long time, and by far the best WW1 shooter ever.  I am very pleased with the animations and graphics of the game, and the ballistics of the weapons are on point. The dev's have done an amazing job recreating the trench warfare of the Great War.   FAIR WARNING TO ANYONE READING THIS WHO'S THINKING OF BUYING VERDUN:  The game is a WW1 Trench FPS Shooter.  That mean's it's a MEAT GRINDER. Expect to die ALOT and OFTEN!!!  DO NOT get mad if you die often, because EVERYONE dies at least 30 times a match when they start playing!  The game is near impossible to play in the usual run-n-gun style of more modern fps's, as it is about cover and strategic co-op with your teammates.  Keep in mind that the entire game is made to be as real as possible to WW1; this means single-shot kills, little cover outside of the trenches, no kill cams, and other variables like gun sway when aiming and breathing.  Once you have played for a while, you will begin to understand the do's and don't's of trench warfare, and the game will get easier. (provided your teammates aren't afk) Remember, DO NOT GIVE UP AND QUIT. This game is made to be tough, but once you get the hang of playing Verdun, it will be one of the best games you've ever played.",

            "review_text": "This game is a lot of fun. Definitely a realistic WW1 shooter. The guns are cool to use, running around in the trenches and peeking out through debris is intense, and the mechanics work pretty well. The game modes include:  -Frontlines: The game\\'s main play mode. You and the enemy team take turns duking it out over the trenches. If your team gets a certain number of kills during your offensive, you gain \\'momentum\\' and the offensive continues. If they manage to resist your push, you run back to your trench. It\\'s sort of like a tug-of-war, but a lot bloodier and more intense. -Rifle Deathmatch: Free-for-all with WW1 guns. \\'Nuff said. -Squad Defence: This one is my favorite, but it\\'s probably the glitchiest. You and up to three other players take positions in a trench and attempt to repel hundreds of bots that come in waves. Kill a certain amount of bots and you win. If everyone on your team dies, you move back to the next trench and try to defend from there. The game ends when you lose the last trench. -There\\'s one other that I can\\'t remember but not many people play it.  However, this game does have its issues, and I hope the devs patch them sooner rather than later, because i want to keep playing this game. First off, there\\'s no in-game voice chat, as far as i can tell. I can understand that they don\\'t want people to communicate from one end of the trench to another without having to stop and type, because that would get stupid immediately. But why not allow it within squads? Imagine, as you and your squadmates rush from the trench across no man\\'s land, you can call out where you see enemies so that your comrades have a chance to survive. Vicinity chat, like in DayZ or another WW2 game (which i can\\'t remember the name of) would be a welcome addition, as well. Secondly, there\\'s a really big glitch in the Squad Defence mode, where bots don\\'t spawn, leaving you with the choice of killing yourself or disconnecting. There are a few others, but I haven\\'t seen much of them.  If you\\'re looking for a high-action shooter with a realistic, back-in-time feel, this is your game. 8.5/10",

My personal tips for new players: -pick a non vital role. play as a rifleman until you've figured out how the game flows and how some of the other classes use their weapons to its best abilites.  -be prepared to die. lots. like a said, its primarily one shot kills, and if theres a well placed enemy machine gunner then everyone will be dieing on regular basis.  -don't worry about reloading or saving grenades. you most likely will not live long enough. this will change, just wait till you have a moment when you realized you survived an encounter that you usually die in.  -even spread defense. it works in rugby, its works in verdun. spread out and cover the sections of land in front of you, if theres a weak spot, the enemy will find it. also if theres a spot on the trench no one wants to defend because theres constant machine gun fire and bombing, thats the spot they'll be invading.  -watch your mini map. defending: watch for areas with weak numbers. attacking: if you see a teammate(s) in the trench infront of you then theres no enemy there, charge in and give em a hand.  -communicate with your team. if theres a camper, if you see a mass charge, if the enemy has just killed you and are invading that side of the trench, let em know. make your reports short but detailed. again youll see the flow of the game after a while  - last but not least. GET IN THERE!!- rifles are the most common weapon in the game. if you have a single shot rifle that does not make you a sniper even if you can peg a guy or two from 150+ yards. snipers have scopes. if your rifle has a bayonet then your role is to charge, and keep charging. we only win if we're in the trench we're attacking.

People might get annoyed at how if you're in the wrong place at the wrong time, you could easily get killed by a sniper or artillary barage. But then again that's how real war goes. Real war and real death is random and merciless.   The negatives are that the framerate drops easily. I have an i5 4460 processor with a gtx 960 and my game sometimes drops to 30 frames even when I turn settings down. I have heard from another person who has an i7 with a gtx 980 and they also get framerate drops. So this is a problem. Also, the character animations are kind of ragdollish. I would also appreciate it if the gun sounds were more consistent. When a gun shot is far away, it just sounds like a regular gun shot at a lower volume. If they really want to make realistic powerful gun sounds, then they should learn from Battlefield, because Battlefield has the best gun sounds.    But other than that the game is great. Good graphics and textures. The guns are varied but not too overpowered. The uniforms are realistic. And it rewards cooperation. I would recommend it to fps fans with a bit of patience and people who like the historical element.",

It was at this point i realised. I was no longer the hunter. The sniper i had been waiting for had me in his scopes. 100 yards away staring me dead in the face. I froze. There was a moment of time that seemed to last for a lifetime where we both just stared at eachother. I then saw the flash of his gun. i fell, my face in the dirt that was the end, Of that life i respawned found him and shot him with a smug face. Made me think of the film 'Enemy at the Gates.'

The colours are muted and almost like a sepia, which preferably reflect the bleak trench warfare that WWI is known for, It perhaps feels like an Indie FPS and that's what it is, but it's realistic without losing that fun element. Despite having only two gamemodes, they both offer some what of a different experience.  This game conjured up memories of playing the original Medal of Honor and Call of Dutys and while comparisons will be perhaps inevitable, this game already has hit me in the nostalgic feels.

Verdun offers a realistic, gritty take on the inafamous 'Battle of Verdun', a final stand for the French that took almost 2 years to resolve. This shooter differs from your run-of-the-mill 'shoot the bad guy' shooter. In Verdun, you are focused on gaining ground and tsking trenches. The Trench warfare is fast and gritty, to where 1 shot will almost definitely kill you. Verdun is not a rush-playstyle type of game, every move you make, every step you take, somone's watching you. One misstep, and your life could be taken right from you. Verdun offers over ten factions to play as, in cluding The French, Germans, Ottoman Empire, Belgium, The United States, England and Canada. All of these factions have 2 sub classes placed within them, giving a certain playstyle to that sub class. For example, the US Marine subclass is used for clearing trenches with ease, while the US Doughboy sub-class is used for suppressive fire. The community is acceptable and not filled with 10 year olds trying to be 'MLG'. Sadly, Verdun isn't perfect. Connection is sometimes goofy and the team balance is sometimes off, causing a crucial game. Overall, Verdun is a solid 9.5/10. It offers a fun, realistic experience that any fan of the time period should enjoy. Once you play one game of Verdun, you will be hooked for a while.

A bit like Red Orchestra with one hit kills but the maps are very trench/dugout orientanted else u stick your head up and die. Its punishingly realistic, but somehow manages to be fun even after dying over and over again after getting caught in barbed wire. The levels and weapons feel authentic and the gore system is brutal, giving a great sense of immersion. I actually suggest turning crosshair and/or tactical hud off to get really into the game.  The game heavily encourages individuals in a squad to stick together with their nco on the objective, rewarding them with upgraded stats or abilities for the nco such as a mortar shot to a sector barrage. Quite a bit of variety in the squad nation seletion and fun with a group of 4, it has a squad lobby system for match making, but at times its best to go to the server map thing and find a server when they're all full/empty.  The unlock systems a bit finicky a first as you'll want to unlock all the tiers of the classes in each individual nation, slow at first but eventually you'll have it all if your getting enough score ingame.  Gameplay pretty much comes down to this, pretty much in order.    Defending your current trench from the oposing team for a time limit (keep them out of the trench)    Fush out the trench if it goes into overtime. It means they have men in your trench beyond their attack time that u can push off to     Holding off a counter attack if you advance your line.    Attacking either the trench you just lost or forward if the attacks failed and have to fall back.   You gain a point each time you successfully take an enemy tench so sometimes there can be a lot of back and forth over the same patch of ground.

It's a fun game, especially with friends, the hit detection is good, and the game is based on skill, ability to work as a team, to the point where you can level up your squad's abilities, the more you play with it, not only on an individual level, but as a group level, for example, one of the squad could unlock a kit that gives him a machinegun, but you are unable to sprint while holding the machinegun. If the squad levels, they will be able to sprint within range of the NCO, and eventually even if they aren't in range of the NCO.   The combat is at times, slow, based on patience and accuracy, and the ability to spot a target over a long distance, rewarding accuracy and good hand-eye co-ordination, but at the same time it can also be fast, and reflex based, especially when rushing a trench. Most of the weapons in the game are Bolt-action rifles, so obviously, every shot counts, so far as I've played the second most common weapons are pistols, be they revolvers, or semi-automatics.  One member of the squad is the NCO, they are the commander of your squad, giving orders, giving certain buffs in an area around them (the command range) and each squad's NCO has a different ability, ranging from recon planes, to Mustard gas and mortar support.  Overall the game is enjoyable, good fun, and great for having a laugh with your friends.  One last thing: Be prepared to die a lot. It happens.  8/10",

One shot is all it takes for the most part, with a few small exceptions where you might take one and live to tell about it. Sitting in the trenches, you peek your head over to see what goes on, only to see a seemingly empty no-mans-land. There is no hud, there are no enemy markers, you use your good ol' mark one eyeballs. Then, as you have a false sense of security, you start aiming around to try and spot something and all of a sudden your worst nightmare comes true, a gas attack. The trenches are filled, you don't see ♥♥♥♥, literally maybe a meter infront of you, unable to identify friend from foe, it's a mess. Some of the gas might move a little, and then there it is.. a bunch of huns, gasmasks on, charging like the devil out of the gas and into the trenches screaming god knows what at you whilst baraging you with accurate rifle fire. The suppression system makes itself known by then, the screen goes bleak, your aim is off, and your character is frightened and unable to properly fight till the effects wear off. Cowering away and turning around, even more of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s keep going at you, not stopping their charge and sprinting with all they have, shooting and stabbing whatever they find. Every single kill is so worth it, it really gives a sense of satisfaction. This, is the darksouls of the shooters. You wil die. Over and over again. But then once you catch on, you start returning the favor, learning to lead properly as it is VERY tricky at the start to do so. Couple of hours later, you yourself wil be the one instilling fear into the enemy as you charge the trenches, jumping ontop of players and stabbing/shooting them with all you have, maybe lob a grenade or two if you have them. This game is great, the graphics are wonderfull, not over the top but pleasing to the eyes. The sounds make you think you are there, the artillery blowing everything to hell around you, bullets whizzing over your head and into the mud surrounding you, comrades screaming their warcries which honestly for me only inspire me to attack even harder. The weapons handle great, each and every one of them have their own 'manual' so to speak, they really are very different in how they handle, how they aim, reload, clip size. Teamwork is almost always present, there's always a bunch of chaps in the team that direct others and most respond. For example the left side of the trench gets breached, they wil direct the forces in that direction, or when they spot a large group charging like mad they'll notify the team and again most can and wil respond. This game is anti-noob at it's purest, it discourages the CoD players and such, leaving only players willing to be a part of something greater, there's very few solo players as those get rekt, hard. And the balancing, good god it is beautifull. Nothing is OP, though admittedly the german MP18 does get close to being it, luckily there's one or two of them being used at most and i am sure this wil get nerfed sometime as it does have a rather incredible range for a machine pistol. The devs are active and responcive, they DO listen to the players, take suggestions into account and work out the best way to use them.   TL;DR, GET THE GAME ALLREADY, it's like the baby made when darksouls and arma mated, and NO P2W AT ALL, it simply does NOT exist in the game.",

Cons - technically not quite there yet. poor framerate and stuttering with graphical options on lowest - glitches and bugs that come with the game being not complete  WW1 is a criminally underrepresented game setting and Verdun is the champion of the genre.

The maps are also interesting with your typical treeless miles of crater filled mud where only the quick of feet survive , half destroyed fortresses , trenches with players struggling in close quarter combat with pistols, grenades and bayonets, french farm land where men charge and die for a little more than 100 yards of corn only to reach trench on the other side    Not to mention that one reason I like this game is the use of automatic weapons is ether restricted to realistic levels or having disadvantages such as not being able to fire until deployed or having horrid hip fire accuracy.

The battlefields are vast and beautifully rendered, and picking your way across no-man's land can be a harrowing experience, like playing whack-a-mole as a the mole, but worth it once you and whoever is left of your squad finally run amok inside the enemy trench-complex (anyone can be a spawn point so, as long as someone made it across, you can spawn into a trench assault). Being squad-based, it is very much a team-sport, so take a minute to review squad roles before jumping in, but it's not that complicated. The main thing is, follow your NCO (and unlock a rifle if you're unhappy with the default load-out; there's a rifle for almost every class). Overall, I am genuinely impressed by the way that historically informed squad roles, pitted against each other across a huge variety of landscapes, can make for such well balanced game-play. 5 stars.",

With so many WWII, futuristic, and various other FPS, squad based games out there, WWI tended to be overlooked as a premise for this kind of game. No longer...  This game is about as historically on-point, gritty, realistic, and tough as nails as it gets for a FPS. Here are some pros and cons:  CONS - One hit kills, which means you will die A LOT. So, very little room for error - Prone blocking, which means you will sometimes be under heavy fire and you can't lay flat on some surfaces and subsequently, will get gunned down cause you couldn't get low enough - Can become frustrating at times because the rest of your squad doesn't work together or communicate, hence making it all that harder to win a match - Current version does not currently feature other powers who were involved in the Great War. Russia and the Austro-Hungarian Empire come to mind.   PROS - Lets you slip into a time warp and you really feel like you are there with the music, environment, weaponry, chemical warfare, and trench fighting that make up the game - Challenging (as I said, one hit kills). Plus, you need to be strategic to survive. No run-and-gun gameplay here. That will only get you killed. The game will force you to utilize cover, work together as a squad, and test your ability to hold a location when defending and to force an enemy out of their trench after charging thru the deadly no-man's land - Relatively good price and a great time waster for the money - Developers are active, responsive, and want to hear your input - Easy controls to learn - Many different historically accurate unit types to master and level up   That's just brushing the surface. Point is, if you like FPS squad games, this will test your mettle and make COD or similar titles feel very childish and simple by comparison. Definitely worth your time!  8/10",

Verdun offers a realistic, gritty take on the inafamous 'Battle of Verdun', a final stand for the French that took almost 2 years to resolve. This shooter differs from your run-of-the-mill 'shoot the bad guy' shooter. In Verdun, you are focused on gaining ground and tsking trenches. The Trench warfare is fast and gritty, to where 1 shot will almost definitely kill you. Verdun is not a rush-playstyle type of game, every move you make, every step you take, somone's watching you. One misstep, and your life could be taken right from you. Verdun offers over ten factions to play as, in cluding The French, Germans, Ottoman Empire, Belgium, The United States, England and Canada. All of these factions have 2 sub classes placed within them, giving a certain playstyle to that sub class. For example, the US Marine subclass is used for clearing trenches with ease, while the US Doughboy sub-class is used for suppressive fire. The community is acceptable and not filled with 10 year olds trying to be 'MLG'. Sadly, Verdun isn't perfect. Connection is sometimes goofy and the team balance is sometimes off, causing a crucial game. Overall, Verdun is a solid 9.5/10. It offers a fun, realistic experience that any fan of the time period should enjoy. Once you play one game of Verdun, you will be hooked for a while.

Plus only the British can fire the gun while standing. The only part I hate about this game is that when on attack they do force everyone to attack which is historically incorrect, but there will be games where the other team has like 3 snipers sniping on their attack which to many, becasue well you can barely setup without getting sniped. Besides that this game is amazing; they're are some glitches, but they can hardly take away the gameplay at all. So if you love history especially wars this is the game for you.

Very realistic and a one of a kind game. Weapons and maps are perfect for each other. The limited use of recon, and mass use of artillery and gas makes it feel more like a WW1 game and lets it stand out. Glad they added more maps but it could use more. Some buggy moments here and there but not enough to get into a twist about. Fast paced and fun to play while drinkin a beer. Just wish there was a way to save your squad progress for later, because when you have unlocked different uniforms and perks to use in game, then either your internet goes out or you have to leave you cant go back to it, you have to restart in most cases. All in all a great, game and its still in Alpha, just squad up with some friends and open a beer, decent way to spend a Thursday night. Defiantly worth a buy, but since there are so few maps it gets sort repetitive, and there arn't a ton of people who play it, so get used to seeing a lot of the same people, yet thats not always a bad thing. HAVE A DECENT PC WHEN YOU PLAY, the game is very demanding otherwise and you might not be able to play it without mass frame drop and lag.I'd give it a 9/10 due to the few maps. If you are looking for a WW1 COD type game then this is not for you!!! All in all it's worth the buy!!",

Now no gamepad support despite what it claims and I tried xbox and logitech gamepads. Other than these issues its a good and unique game and have found games and matches quick.  Can't even play the game (haven't played it for 1 second despite 3 hrs total on the start up screen) and a few more hours reading about potential issues and checking my settings!  I meet or exceed all the requirements, have followed all the settings, suggestions and such. I did lots of research to find I am certainly not alone as many have issues - esp those with intel drivers. Then it says anti-virus and firewall blocks, which I had addressed with AVG software, disabled for all steam games and did for Verdun. Also says video chip vs card used and followed all the instructions to fix it many times.   Its not worth the time anymore, wasted well over 3 hours trying to get it to work. Not very user friendly. I have played some other Multiplayer games without such issues.   Any suggestions?   Can't refund it, had it for awhile.  It looks like a good game otherwise.

Also, WWI games are pretty rare too, its always WWII or 'Modern warfare' or space with most of the big AAA deathmatch games, so seeing a WWI game of such high quality is definitely an eye catcher. While the main gameplay mode can be confusing sometimes, Verdun also comes with other, more standard, game modes such as team deathmatch and free-for-all (and now a new co-op mode).

It's definitely a different experience from a game like Call of Duty or Battlefield.   It's more brutal. You see people exploding from mortars, people laying on the ground bleeding to death and crying. You see limbs torn from bodies and blood everywhere. And that damn barbed wire...  It's slower paced. You pop your head out of trenches, scan for enemies, and quickly get back down. You can either get your head blown off right away or live long enough to off a couple enemies and get back into cover. Don't expect to be able to run out into the open for longer than 5 seconds without getting shot. It's a one shot, one kill deal. There is also a respawn timer to simulate reinforcements.  You have squads with specific roles that you have to play as. You can't custom select your weapons much at all, you choose a role and use what they give you.  It's also a nice change from the Americans vs Russians/Chinese/terrorists thing that's been going on. Here we have a few different factions that you can be a part of.   I recommend this game to people who like historical shooters. It's really fun, possibly due to it being more slower paced and adding to the realism.

This game has lot of good things (maps are nice and detailed, accuracy, music as for examples) and many other that have been impoved since the early version.   Nice to be able to play with Canadians, Royal Tommies, Poilus or Germans Stosstruppen. By choosing a class, you will use different weapons that are specific from your class and army. With this choice, your strategy will never be the same: if you play as a gunner, you will not run fastely, so you will have to be very careful to choose the correct area to put your gun and fire. If you uses grenades, you will need to be in contact to the ennemies in their trench. And if you play as an officer you will show troops where to progress, and have the ability to use artillery, gazes, aerial reco or bombing.  Increasing classes is easy you don't have to play an eternity to get your next level (as it was at the early stages).  Combat challenges are fun, and will help you to get medals and rewards in order to improve you level fastely. Another great point is the fact that the game alternates attack times with defense times: when attack, you will have some time to take the ennemy's trench, and while defend, you need to defend your position. Thus your team progress and you can win (or loose) the game.  I didn't recommended that game while it was in early access, but since the release, it is much much much better. You can give it a try...Or you are fooool and rrrrrreeettatattaaaarrrrded ;o)  VERDUN IS A MUST TO HAVE !!!!!!!!   Ted",

This game is made for a ver specific type of gamer who enjoys a slower tae on the FPS genre but it can get hectic very quickly. If you are not a fan of WW1 then i do not recomend buying it becaseu the aestethic of this game is what really sold me. If you are a fan of 1 hit kill games i can recomend this but if you want a faster pace game i would recomend something like Insurgency or Red Orchestra 2. The combat is a bit stiff but it somehow works with the combat there is to have in both no mans land and the trenches. The class system tey have is very cool in my opinion with set roles for each player in their respective squads. the weaponry is very cool ranging from shovels and knives to bipod only machin guns. The maps ar really cool to play on but only really worth i byplaying on its main game mode Frontline which is a tug of war type mode using trenches. One team attacks while the other defends and it can make for some really nice gameplay and grea moments. Some issues i personally hsve are with the player count iin game. One team can brutally dominate the other if one doesnt have enough players to play key roles like the leader to drop smoke and gas or the machine gunner to lay down supressive fire. The penalty for being on the higher populated team is just a 3-6 second respawn delay. Thats my biggest gripe with the game and i am only 12 hours in and I get itchs to play the game just to get my fix. Only if hardcore mechanics and WW1 is your thing i would recomend this buy. To everyone else would recomend a try but not a hard sell. 8/10",

It is an excellent game on WW1 infantry combat in the trenches, with a polished, fun, distinct gameplay, delivering a great mix of enjoyment and verisimilitude.  It is not a simulation or an overly realistic fps, but neither is a battlefield/cod ripoff. There is an impressive attention to details, maps, weapons, uniforms. Weapons feel very believable, and the map design matches perfectly the trench-warfare gameplay: long, narrow maps, with lots of cover, where running between the trenches is a great but inevitable risk and fighting in the trenches is a bloody close quarter business.

            "review_text": "I'm a new player with only a couple hours experience so take that into consideration. As I gain more experience I will update this review. So far my impression of this game is rather mixed, more positive than negative but definitely not glowing.   Presentation wise it's pretty solid. Graphics are rather good for a smaller game, I have them cranked on a 970 and it runs at a smooth 60 fps so no complaints there. Audio is solid, gun sounds are good and artillery is appropriately booming, nice little audio flourishes like bullets plinking off metal are good touches. The maps are visually solid, though the color pallet is a bit more washed out than it needs to be - this isn't a vibrantly colorful game. Ones natural reaction might be to think that makes sense given the subject matter but in reality wars are fought in all environments, WW1 took place on as many bright sunny desserts, verdant green forests and blooming fields of wild flowers as it did on mud strewn wastelands. This is a minor gripe though, and not something really worth docking the game for.  There is visual jankyness though, I've died numerous times to enemies that appear to be facing sideways from me, or pointing their weapons in the dirt so where someone is looking is only vaugely indicated by their actual model. Also seen numerous instances of ally and enemy alike holding invisible guns.   I can't confirm this, I could be mistaken, but I suspect this is yet another one of those competitive shooters where you will want to play on low settings. I've been shot a few times while completely obscurred by brush, trees, barbed wire and rocks which has me thinking a lower graphics setting may remove a lot of the cover clutter. Again I have not tested this, but it seems likely.   So far my biggest knocks on the game are mechanical and gameplay oriented. I'm a fairly big history buff, so I'm well aware of what kind of warfare a WW1 set shooter would entail. I went into Verdun expecting to die freaquently and quickly and that does happen. Frequent deaths and a low life expectancy do not automatically mean a game can't be fun howerever, in fact a game can be a great deal of fun while still sporting that playstyle. Unfortunately there are some issues that make this substantially less enjoyable than it should be.  Firstly the player count per match is extremely low. I've had matches that were barely eight players per side (I believe the max is 16) which is just pitiful and seriously hampers the feeling of actually being in the War to End All Wars. It really seems like this is a setting that absolutely needs 64 player battles minimum to do itself justice, that or it needs to follow the Battlefront (original ones, not the halfassed new one) model of including bot soldiers to make the fight seem larger than it is.  The low player count really causes problems with the set up. The nature of this games setting means you are throwing yourselves into meat grinders intended to be fought by huge numbers of men, when you boil an 'Up and Over' attack through no-mans land down to less than a dozen attacking players; what should be an epic assault just feels like fish in a barrel. You get destroyed (as expected) but since there's so few people on your side, you don't make any progress against an enemy that's half awake. Even when you do, the low player count sucks a lot of the epicness out of what should be a harrowing set piece. In some ways it ends up feeling much like any other shooter, just with clunky antique guns.  This is made worse by excessive re-spawn timers. Your first death can have you twiddling your thumbs for almost thirty seconds. That may not sound like much, but when you often die in a single hit and you are charging through a shooting gallery against artillery, machine guns, submachine guns, mortars and grenades.. well you may be in game for an hour and only actually play for 15 minutes. Matches become a somewhat frustrating routine of playing for 45 seconds to a minute before waiting to respawn. Often you won't accomplish anything during those minutes of life either, especially as a new player. You're often even lucky to have something even shoot at in that time. Frequent deaths from completely unseen opponents are common.  One thing you will notice very quickly is a complete lack of any reliable way to identify enemy players other than their uniforms/silouhettes. While that's an interesting touch of realism and can be learned, in practice it just feels extremely frustrating - particularly for new players. The game does not feature any kind of friendly fire, so you can just shoot at anything if you're not sure but that feels like a janky work around. At the very least it seems like enemies should have red names over their heads when within a certain range of you when you have your crosshair on them (that way it wouldn't affect using cover to hide at range). I've already died a number of times because some enemy solider was in a trench (often my own trench, often spawn camping) and there was no visible indication it wasn't a friend until I was already dead. This is especially problematic on maps with heavy shadows, another situation where I suspect playing the game on low settings is probably a substantial benefit. The low player count per team also plays in here as the mostly empty maps make it easy for experienced players to get into the others sides lines, with 32 players per side it would be substantially easier to maintain solid front lines and at least be able to expect enemies to come from the front.. instead of spawn camping behind you.  Another major issue, especially for new players, is there seems to be no descernable matchmaking in this game at all. My first matches were tossed in with a smattering of rank 1-5s, and many rank 50-90s. Players that clearly have dozens if not hundreds of hours and every map memorized were simply paired against players like myself that clearly just bought the game, the result was predictable. I'm not sure if the games playerbase is simply to small for proper matchmaking or if it was an oversight on the devs part but it makes the game substantially less enjoyable and much less new player friendly.  Verdun features an odd progession system, but I can't really comment on it yet as I don't have enough experience with it. I just dislike progression treadmills in general so I never like seeing them.   Do I reccomend this game? Honestly I want to say yes, it's such an incredibly under-repesented period in history and the game certainly seems to try doing the setting justice. low-magazine size, innacurate, slow reload weapons abound which can make for a refreshingly different pace of game compared to standard FPS. That said the new player experience so far has been rather unenjoyable and I suspect this is a game you are going to have to slog through before you reach the point you can really enjoy it. A rank/skill based matchmaking system would at the very least help tremendously but it seems non-existant.  I guess I cautiously reccomend this game so far. Just be aware of what you are getting into and expect frustration.  ",

Verdun distances itself from the stereotypical FPS genre and its tropes in several notable ways. 1. You WILL DIE, a lot! – You are charging across open fields at OHK weapons 2. You need to be Fast AND precise – most weapons are BA’S and you don’t want to be caught with no bullet in the chamber. 3. You NEED to work together – only as a group will you even stand a chance at reaching your enemy’s. Once you understand this, and learn how to compensate for it, you are good to go!  Behind the first layer of frustration imbued on us by our past FPS experience, lies a challenging but Fun and rewarding shooter that gives you just a bit of a glimpse at what WWI trench warfare was actually like.

You could be advancing onto a Central Powers trench, and be gassed, or bombarded by artillery, there could be a machine gunner hiding out in a bunker waiting for you, this game and it's players are truly unpredictable, just as a real war would be. Now, although the minimum says 'GTX 960', I play fine on a GTX 760 with graphics all on high, so this game can be affordable and easy to play, especially on low graphics if you have a toaster for a PC. Verdun's weapons range from the French Fusil Automatique to the German 'Wex' Flammenwerfer(Flamethrower), The regiments vary from all the participating countries, (Besides Austria-Hungary, Russia, and Italy. I also don't personally think they'll add them either.) Overall, this game is a must have if you admire WW1 and it's brave soldiers.",

But let’s speak about positives first:  Pros  - well-designed extensive maps inspirited by real battlefields of WWI - satisfying and challenging gunplay - broad gameplay variability based upon different classes to play with - required cooperation between squad players in order to win  - friendly and helpful community  - solid optimization  Verdun is a good game, very good indeed but it fails to deliver the most crucial game experience:  Cons  - nothing like an immersive WWI trench warfare experience   Well, WWI looked anything but this. Few players camping throughout a waste battlefield make the game pretty infuriating and in time it only gets worse. Verdun will become BORING for many players as it became for me and this lack of players is exactly what buries the game underground.  Not to mention another great problem with  - feels like still playing BETA  Before the supposedly full game release, there was a lot updates and a lots of gigs to download, containing some bug fixes but now, the game is in the same state as it was in beta. I was very disappointed about this literally forced 1.0 release and I'm still waiting for major upgrades in shady areas like  - infuriating lag  In the game which is more or less about precision I fail to comprehend how it is possible for developers not to improve upon teleporting moving players which happens all the time! I'd like to blame myself for mistakes I do in game like Verdun where I die constantly, but this is deliberately very bad coding and no one seems to give a f__k.  - buggy bugs   The game even though it is supposed to be now in a full release state still suffers from numbers of persisting bugs and lags. I'm convinced developers will fix majority of them in time, because they really care about their product, which is worth mentioning again.   Do I recommend this game?   It depends to whom. I have no hesitation of recommending Verdun to anyone interested in WWI warfare even though it fails to deliver the genuine experience but for a casual player the game might quickly become boring and frustrating.  I've spent over 120 hours into the game and I don't regret it, neither the investment, 'cause it was a very FUN to PLAY, but I don't think I'll play again until the core game mechanics will be improved.",

            "review_text": "Trigger warning: may contain observations and opinions that hurt feels. Updated almost two and a half months later after playing again recently. Also the comments section is not there to waste my time discussing every little detail. This review is there for potential customers who have never played Verdun. Enjoy being ignored if you feel like flamebaiting or trolling.  TLDR: 6,5/10. Good, but not great. Very atmospheric game with lots of undeveloped potential that has issues. So a red thumb because Steam forces me to be black and white like that.  I feel strongly about this game and I really used to like it, so that is why I write this as a warning for potential buyers and as constructive criticism toward the developers. The positive reviews show many people 'want' this only WW1 MP FPS available today to be good and so do I, but I am at a point where the bad outweighs the good. This game has tons of atmosphere and potential but it is being dragged down by some of its flaws. You can read several reviews citing poor optimisation, no spawn protection getting you in a loop of being spawnkilled over and over again, clunky controls etc. that are also correct. But these are my personal five reasons that mar my enjoyment of this game to the point of not being able to really recommend it anymore in descending order of annoyance.  - glitchy weirdness, exploiting or worse in PvP: in a significant portion of sessions I have played, for instance an invincible guy around level five with two hours on the counter or with a similar profile joins and starts killing people who are hiding wherever they are on the map, not a single shot missed at high rates of fire. They end up with K:D scores like 55:0 against people level 80 and above. This game also lacks vote kick options so you are left with people who use exploits or such cheats for as many matches as they wish to stay. One option that does not explain everything my regular squad of four has seen is that these people are using low graphical quality settings and terrain clipping exploits. One example of the other mysteries that remain unsolved to this day is how players who are perfectly hiding at the bottom of a trench with no enemies around get shot from far away through ground and sandbags.  Update: friend with 275 hours showed me footage of aimbotting (immobile player making stab kills in the distance) post-summer sale...  - nonsensical spawns: I am not even talking about the lack of spawn protection, rather there are circumstances where you have to defend a trench and the game decides to spawn you about a 100 m away from it and you have to run through a stretch of no man's land that has no cover whatsoever to attack the trench you are supposed to defend. That is not what defence or holding your ground means. Yes, that also means GG because the opponents can mow you down with impunity.  - classes and weapons: some are clearly meant to be under- or overpowered. The German side has very few portable MGs that take too awkwardly long to set up and to be effective except for heavily prepared and dug in defence scenarios, and all of their rifles have only five rounds (Entente usually eight to ten). While this is historically correct, it is very annoying to see there is no balance when confronted with Entente soldiers that can fire basically all MGs like the Lewis, Chauchat and BAR while running, they have an OP semi automatic rifle and do not need to reload as much. Reloading can be deadly because it is an awkward procedure that is harder to interrupt than in other FPS I have played. Some classes are not even assigned a firarm which I feel is a poor choice. A source of minor annoyance is that you cannot pick up dropped weapons or restock on ammunition (but you typically do not live long enough to run out of it).  - silly suicides: instead of invisible walls some games have added a warning system with or without a timer to return back to the zone the game wants you to be in. In Verdun not getting back to the zone in time instantly kills you and the game says it is a suicide that costs you XP. I have noticed these timers often are too short to get back to the map. I have also charged at the beginning of matches into the right part of no man's land only to discover I am getting suicided.  - bots in coop: they teleport. One moment they are thirty meters in front of you, the next they respawn next to you in the trench and stab you. Obviously at this point the coop mode is relatively new, in general has very rough edges and needs work.  Update over two months later: flying, teleporting, invisible bots and invisible weapons galore. This mode still needs work unfortunately.  Positive bit:  - We can hope these things will change because the game is still actively being supported and expanded.   But for now if you ask me with the things I have mentioned: thumbs down for the current state of the game which tends to annoy or frustrate just a tad too often.",

            "review_text": "  I started playing Verdun over three years ago back in it's infancy in the browser version. I picked the game up in December of 2013 on steam. A few months after it's initial release on steam. I was instantly hooked. The gunplay, maps, and everything was an enjoyable and amazing experience. It was a beta and as expected it had bugs and issues.   Fast forward to April 28th 2015. The game was released out of it's early access and was no longer in any form of beta. Surely if the game was being released from beta it would mean the bugs had been fixed? The game had been polished? Unfortunately no. It's not really understood why the devs decided to release the game out of early access so fast. A quick playthrough would have shown that it wasn't ready upon release and was still a game that played like it was in early access. It still does to this day. Although this isn't where my actual sentiment with Verdun comes from. While the game still had issues at release it was indeed as bug free as it had ever been. I still commend the devs for what was probably the smoothest major update ever in the games history. Basically no new issues to be heard of and we got a fantastic new map Aisne. Release was an optimistic time as the game was in the most polished state it had ever been, while still buggy and playing like a beta, it was still playing better than ever before. Many new players came to check out the game, as did returning players from the early access, and things looked to be on the up and up.  The real issues begin at the end of August in 2015. This first major update after Verdun’s release in April. This update was known as the attrition update. It introduced a new gamemode which known as ‘’attrition’’ hence why it was the ‘’attrition’’ update, but furthermore it also introduced clutter to the maps. Clutter consisted of random trash and crap scattered all over the map. Things like bullets, gear from soldiers, and dead bodies. Admittedly it does make the maps feel more lively and more authentic, but this update was the beginning of trouble with Verdun. It was very clear in the test branch for this update that the clutter added mainly to Flanders and Artois was absolutely destroying the FPS performance. Despite very clear warnings to the devs the update was released. As a result the performance of 2 of the 6 maps in the game at the time had been majorly compromised. Logically you would have expected the devs to rollback the update with no immediate fix to the performance problems in sight. Unfortunately they chose to keep this update in the game and as a result performance of the maps was ruined. People with medium to high end PC’s struggled to run the maps above 60FPS even on lower end settings. This nightmare continued on for four entire months. During this four month period the devs actually made performance worse on other maps, and continued to break the game further. Despite what this added clutter had done to Artois and Flanders the devs still felt it was a good idea to continue on adding it to other maps.   After this four month struggle had ended the player base had seen significant drops and losses, the competitive scene was all but dead after it had been cancelled due to the performance problems, and the game had been through hell. Despite this it was still alive and I was still playing. It was in December of 2015 when performance was fixed finally and I thought we had been through the worst. Going back to a few months before this in September the devs started a campaign known as weapon wednesday. Every week they would tease images/gifs of new weapons and features coming in the future. This would last well beyond December and into March of 2016. This was a rather questionable decision as it really annoyed more people than it hyped as it lasted too long and people became frustrated and impatient. In November they released a new map Fort Douaumont. The map had basically no testing or feedback and it was released in the middle of the games performance issues. To this day the map has never been reworked and is incredibly unbalanced and an unenjoyable experience.   After the performance had been smoothed out the game was gearing up for the biggest content drop it had ever seen. The beta for Horrors of war came out in January of 2016. You would have thought that I would have been excited for this, but I wasn’t. Back when they released the game in April of 2015 they had planned for individual DLC releases. All of them had their own name and were all nicely packaged. I believed that this would keep the game content supplied for years to come and as was advertised with their roadmap they would be split up and released at different times. So what did they do? They decided to release almost the entirety of the content in one go. Rather than split it up so there would be several major content drops over time everything was being pushed out at once. This made it impossible to beta test everything and give this update any chance of coming out smoothly. Furthermore they decided to change core game mechanics for no apparent reason. This would go on to drive veterans away from the game as Verdun was no longer they game they were used to playing. Despite very clear warnings from players that the beta for Horrors of war was still buggy and not ready for release it went through anyway. As a result on the 23rd of March 2016 we got a very buggy and broken update known as Horrors of war.   The fact is that the devs were continuing on this path of bad decisions and shortcomings. It wouldn’t take long for the next bad decision and questionable move to come out. In early June they announced the console port. Why would they do this? Hard to say when the PC version was more buggy than it had been in a year, there was still PC content that needed to be released, and the game was nowhere near stable enough to be ported over to consoles. Over of the course of this summer essentially nothing happened. The PC community was left out to hang and dry while the devs focused all their efforts onto the console port of the game. Days before the consoles were set to release they actually postponed the Xbox release. Their rushed console port which was supposed to cash in on BF1 was amusingly being delayed because it straight up wasn’t ready. The PS4 was released on time and initial feedback from players was relatively unpositive. Despite less graphical fidelity the game was locked to 30 FPS and was very buggy. The PC owners were being left out for a buggy and broken console port only being made to cash in on the new interest in WW1 following BF1 being announced. Recently it was discovered that the devs had intentionally added a distance where bullets would be deleted from the map. This was added to help solve performance issues. The distance was 150m and 150m is a relatively common engagement distance on several of Verdun’s maps. As a result players could not take long range engagements simply because the game no longer allowed them to. As opposed to removing pointless clutter, our ability to engage long distance was removed. While Verdun has hit detection that is abysmal, the game is being ported to consoles, Verdun has netcode that makes the early BF4 netcode look decent, but we get gamemodes people never asked for and clutter which ruins the FPS. We might have gotten lots of content with Horrors of war but ultimately when it comes out buggy and is released all at once as opposed to splitting it up to allow sufficient testing and to keep players coming back for more frequent major content drops we get it all at once. It’s been a year since the game first came out on steam and it’s still a buggy game which feels like it’s still in beta. The devs do not seem to want to ever address and fix some of the biggest issues plaguing the game and I myself cannot run out of bad things to say about Verdun at this point.",

Devs, I thought you got better than this. For ♥♥♥♥'s sake, fix your ♥♥♥♥ing game! Until that - ♥♥♥♥ yourself with a cactus.",

Conclsuion: Don't get me wrong this game has amzing potential and well done fellas you beat Battlefield to the punch, if these issues that I listed were fixed Id happily pay more for the game and recommend it to others as I think the idea is innovative and original, its sold to you very well, no doubt about that though just needs the evidence to back it up, even a small campaign or a small mission system that teels of some old war stories would really vamp this game up and I hope you(yes you developers) take this oppurtunity to really improve you're game as you standing in an ocean trying to collect water with a teaspoon at the moment, one last thing please please please don't release this for console yet as it isn't ready as you will be swept aside by so many other games, do some improvements, add some depth and even make it a bit more expensive if you have to, great idea just needs work.",

I havent played it in a few months, but i suggested that some other friends get it so we could start playing again.  What the heck happened? It's like this game went from a well-functioning squad based game to a buggy mess.   First, i wanted to teach my friends the basics, so i went to start a new rifle deathmatch map going, because the only other one was almost full. Nope. Just kept dumping me back into the other RDM map. Used to be able to start a new map, but not anymore. So i said 'forget it, lets just start a squad and join a game.'  You used to be able to slap together a squad and start a game no problem. Now the game dumps our squad onto a map against a single other player. Then it automatically drags my friend out of our squad and into a brand new squad on our team. Now we have two squads against one single guy. So people start joining our two squads and the other guy quits.  Eventually we end up with two full squads against no one. People keep joining the squads on my team and our single enemy team gets zilch. What fun.  Both my friends were glad that this was over in under 2 hours, so they can get refunds.  I've played it a few other times and it's just not the same. Something about the game just doesnt work like it used to. The gas was a great addition, the graphics updates were great but... after i stopped playing for a while, other things must've been updated and the game is worse off. This is sad. I'm very sad that one of my favorite games has become so much less fun. I understand now why my friends who got me into the game never play it anymore.  Do I recommend this game? I used to. I really did. Not anymore. My old friends dont play it, my new friends refunded it. Looks like i have no reason to play or recommend this game again. What a shame.",

This game is suppose to be an authentic WW1 shooter, instead its a very mediocre shooter with no physics, no reason to really play it since the servers are dead most of the time and the people who are on it are the level 100s who end up ruining it as all they do is try to get the highest K/D instead of helping their team out any. The game is laughable for all of its unbalanced gameplay, as some maps have the edge for one side, others the other side. And most of the time, unbalanced teams, there could be a 24 v 10 and nobody on the team of 24 will switch because it'll ruin their chances of getting an easy win. The community is awful alot of the time as they just spurt nonsense and tell you to 'git gud' the few who do help out dont make up for the many.   Altogether its a solidly built game, but seriously isnt worth the full amount, if you can pick it up on sale, do it.

As a regular bolt-action rifle shooter in real life, using historical military rifles, I can shoot several times faster than the characters in this game for sustained periods when I'm half asleep. Literally. And to top it off, the lag turns every match into a contest of moon-jumping spacemen disappearing and reappearing at random intervals. Saw a guy and decided to sensibly duck behind a trench? Too bad, the game decides that you were hit moments before and rubberbands you back into the open to die instantly.

The Game is aimed at a mil sim audiance and maybe I'm just to mutch of a casual gamer to enjoy the game. first of all the things I liked so far about the game: The high degree of authenticifici, i love running around with iron sighted bolt action rifles. Now what I don't like about the game: First of all the grafics, I know, grafics are not everything but I've big problems hitting the three pixel wide head of someone while every pixel seams to relocate after every slight movement with the mouse. So to say I'm playing on Ultra only with aa turned down because the game isn't playable with it turned on. Second I hate that small maps, you have no ability to flank the enemy, maybe historical acurate but not much fun, sitting with 6 people on three squaremeteres of trench waiting for the next enemy to pop up. Third the killing mechanics, you can snipe someone with your pistol who's 50 meteres away or shoot him as soon as he peeks the korner with your shotgun or you use your bolt action rifle and destroy him on any range with a oneshot body shot. So to say you die incredebly fast. As soon as you moove your'e dead, killed by three guys sitting behind the next corner. If you don't moove there is some lvl 100 guy that abselutely wrecks you with his mortar. Saidly killing felt not at all satisfactory to me I just thought oh, he moved first so he died. Because mooving gives you a big inacuracy, you need to stand still for a sec until you can fire again and at this point you're dead. And now my fouth point, there is no balancing in the game, I just played against a team which hat two squads full of lvl 100 clan guys (two different clans) that completely wrecked us where the guy with the highes level on our side was lvl 36. Point five, mapdesign. I don't think it to be good at all, maybe I just didn't understand it but it felt like they just looked at a trench and portet it into the game. So to put it into a nutshell for me this game is to much of a sim and to little a game, and that although I'm a history nerd. So If you love mil sim, don't care about grafics and ww1 I recomend this game for you, all others should pass this one.",

It does not help when my movement &amp; aiming is realistic if the netcode is so bad, that a guy who just a second ago had turned his back to me, while crouching, does a 180° in less than half a second and instantly shoot &amp; kills me.  It does not help when people at bigger distances are rather warping than walking - (kinda like its the case in BF3/BF4) - just in this game the distance this starts to occur is way, waaay less - If you ever played Battlefield 3/4, you know what I mean with warping players at distance. Imagine the map Noshar Canals on BF3, the all loved TDM mode map. From the train yard respawn to the crane, thats the distance players would allready start to warp-run in Verdun, its just bad. In fact you'd still have a very good chance of hitting &amp; killing them, if they would not warp that is... and since not everybody warps, thats even more of an annoyance.  Could be only the players with bad connections warp, could be its random, I dont know, but it does not really matter since w/e the reason may be, its entirely &amp; utterly stupid, gamebreaking and in this game also totaly ambiance-destroying.    Sadly this game also kinda feels like a free2play game the first time you start it. Once you level up you get, lets call them 'unlock points'.  You have 4 classes you can choose from, well classes, they have somewhat different guns but thats it pretty much at the beginning. You need to unlock just everything, its like the new players are ment to be cannon fodder until they somehow manage to get enough unlock points to unlock the good stuff, like Grenades, Scopes, (presumably) better weapons....  In the 60~min I did actually play I got 3 unlock points, everything you unlock costs 1 point BUT now we have weapon attachments aswell, like bajonets &amp; scopes (scopes are a must have pretty much). To get those you need to unlock one after the other, for every gun. So you need to buy the gun for 1 point and then spend 1 point for every attachment. The trick here is attachments unlock after each other, so lets say you want the scope, you still need to unlock the bajonet first to even be allowed to unlock the scope and so forth. It is just stupid.   And that unlock system is right where the next issue starts, you have no idea whats good, what the stats on any gun are, ROF, ammo capacity, damage ... You know it once you unlocked it and even on google I could not find any proper Verdun fansite that would list gun statistics or such. I guess you could google for the historic weapon names but that wont tell how they act in the game, at the most you'll know the amount of ammo they can hold.  So yea, obviously I'm aware that other FPS games also use those, imo, just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 'unlock ingame content by gaining XP' or simular, but Verdun chose to implenet it just extremly badly overall.    Another 'issue', more of a performance problem, when you die you can watch other players untill you respawn. However for some reason watching those players maxes out your GPU. I have a 970 @1400mhz, when playing Verdun maxed (apart of AA. I had on the second highest option), it never went above 75% GPU usage from what I've seen. Once I watch somebody when I'm dead, 99% GPU usage instantly, 55 - 60FPS  Its not necessary a big deal, or anything gamebreaking, but it does not really speak for the performance quality of verdun either.   If you can, somehow, look over all of these issues, dont have a problem with camping &amp; holding positions - like it legimately was in the trenchwarfare in WW1 - and dont have an issue with only seeing one enemy every 30seconds or so (unless they/you actually play the objective and attack-charge), you might get something out of this game. Otherwise, I would not bother. Honestly Verdun looked extremly promissing, but it fails to deliver.",

When trying to play a mode other than the main one there is usually only 1-2 full servers available. The gameplay isn't much fun either. It is nearly impossible to not get sniped the moment you leave the trenches and whenever you're in a good position you have to fall back or you'll be 'executed'.  One good thing it does have though is funny death animations because you'll be seeing them a lot, so it may as well be entertaining to watch your character die.  I honestly wanted to love the game, the concept is awesome and the trailers for it looked awesome, I was deeply disappointed when I played this game as it didn't have the cinematic or realistic charm the trailers had showed it had. If they included a campaign that showed the horrors of the first World War through a first person perspective, I would most likely change my review for this game.  So, I'll give this a 5/10, you can tell the Devs put a lot of work into trying to make this portray the horrors of WWI but it simply cannot pull it off, let alone have it also be very fun.

The ragdoll, if you can call it that, is horrible. You get shot in the torso and die, so your character's arms sink into eachother to make stubs, then fold into your fold. INSIDE of your chest.

It is an AUTHENTIC experience of World War 1 which means that you are going to be killed a lot, I mean A LOT. The UI is buggy and switching weapon or putting on a gas mask takes time and you will die so many times for it. The game IS VERY BUGGY.

This is just one example of many minor horrible small infuriating things with in the game, and the more you have within a single match the worse it is.  Units within the suads are also inbalanced. If you don't end up as a rifleman (usually 2 out of a squad of 4), then your almost guaranteed to be subpar, unless if your use to one shot one kills sort of games. This is what brings me to the biggest issue i have with the game... Its variety of play styles is very limited. Even though it has many weapons, it only really gives you the option of playing limited play styles without much room for leniency. You can carry at most two weapons, but thats based on what you start off with. You can't pick up or trade weapons after you spawn. So if your a rifleman, your stuck as a rifleman.  Now i understand this game is true to the nature of WWI, and how the war was fought, and that history buffs will probably love this game. But its not my cup of tea. All i would say, is that make sure that you watch a few gameplay videos of this game before deciding if you'll buy it, cus if its not close to what kind of FPS games you like to play, then you wont enjoy it...",

            "review_text": "Verdun 1914-18 has been on my radar for over a year. I opted out of the early-release after reading the forums and watching whatever video reviews were available. Based on various posts, videos, and word of mouth, it simply wasn't polished enough then. Although it still held some promise. I decided to wait until the official release to see if the game studio would iron out the major bugs/flaws/issues/etc.  I had high-hopes for this game, but was strongly let down because of a few critical factors:  1.) There is absolutely no single player mode in this game. No ability whatsoever. No provision to fight AI/bots, no sandbox mode for new players to tinker with loadouts/builds, or work on attack routes. No way to feel the game out before you jump into some multiplayer frenzy (more on that later). The closest you get is the ability to make your own private server. This forces you to be 100% always online with this game, and the game also sends/syncs in-game performance info to the devs. So if you want to experiement and end up blowing yourself up, the devs get that info and probably label you with trisomy. Furthermore, while in this mode you can't exactly experiment or test much (like flanking routes) as there isn't even an option for some dummy AI to spam shoot guns or simulate bullets/shells your way. If you cant stand the game enough to unlock additional items via the f-fest that is multiplayer, then you basically run around with a pistol doing and learning absolutely noting beyond sampling the basic trench layout.  2.) The online component can be unplayable. The servers are often laggy, with noregs and desync issues. They also seem to spread the online population throughout relatively low populated shards. A total of ~200 players were online across all the US servers during 'primetime gaming hours' today. I've gathered several data points like this. During another session, no one could log on. This point could become moot, and I do sincerely hope conditions improve.  3.) The matchmaking is either non-existent, glitched, or hasn't (or can't) reached a kind of steady-state. Basically, you have a bunch of WWI fanbois who've been spamming 24/7 nolife hours into this particular game (probably because the competition in other FPS titles is too much). These keeners exploit the overpowered luger pistol making shots that are basically hack-worthy, and have levelled/formed/gelled rock-solid groups and basically dominate entire matches. Its not uncommon to see obscure lobsidded k/d ratios (like 74-2) as people with 1+ years of 'pre release' experience tea-off on a fresh stream of nubs just logging in for the first time. The barrier to entry wouldn't be so bad if the game actually had a lot of people at diverse skill levels spread out into medium populated servers. Unfortunately, all you get are completely barren empty servers (3v3) or full wait in line to join 32v32 battles, the later I have no doubt will become epic once the game matures somewhat. That said, I don't see there being enough carrying capacity to support enough squads wanting to 'go pro' for proper tournaments or any long-term sustainability.  4.) The community is naive, biased, pretentious, etc. Try telling someone this game is 'meh' and you'll be labeled toxic, flamed, and told to gtfo. You can discover this for yourself on the forums, but as I alluded to -- the clout/influence about the game is propped up by a small group (maybe 20-30 ppl). These makeup an inner circle of die-hard players who get first crack at the devs ears, upvoting/downvoting reviews to keep the game looking sharp, and helping to sway design decisions and telling people everything is a-ok. You should see how these players suck up to the devs on stream/forums/in-game/etc.  In general, the game still has some potential but obviously not as anything too serious. Its a basic FPS concept embedded into WWI ambiance that probably isn't worth the $20 at this point. If I had my time back, I would get my nostalgia/fix for WWI content through other vectors. You can catch glimpses of this game on youtube, twitch, etc. Unfortunately, those previews don't show the fact that this game has two options -- press a button to jump into a trench-fight server, or press the button to quit. Without an offline mode, proper matchmaking, polished (net)code, and biased 'community', I'll be looking for an uninstall button after I grind through 5 more hours to bring it to around $2/hour of wasted time.",

Bots, there are no bots and I live in a rural U.S area and i have 2kb per second internet the game runs perfect but it kicks me from servers anyway since my internet is bad. I have wanted bots like so many others but the Developers wanted to rush the game out of early access and not give us what we wanted and to focus on grabbing money. For this reason I highly reccomend that no one buys this game until they fix this bots issue. I would reccomend this highly if they ever fix their damn game so we rural people can play with bots. I know many of you will say im in a rural area and im fine, yeah but my internet is SLOW so fix it or I will never EVER RECCOMEND THIS GAME.",

Don't get me wrong; it can be extremely fun and does wonderful at presenting the Great War. I think this game is worth $10, maybe $15 if it were still being worked on. But not $20.

Another problem I found was when certain checkpoints where taken by the enemy and the lines of war where moved, the left over defenders would be made 'out of bounds' and killed within 5 seconds if they can't run back in time. Instead of allowing those to fight to the last, or do a fighting retreat.  I don't know if they plan to update this game further? But I don't recommend it as it is. ",

The game would benefit immensely by the addition of a campaign.
