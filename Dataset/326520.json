            "review_text": "WOW!  Chime, the original, was released six years ago?!? Where did the time go?  I had no idea a sequel was even on the horizon. I loved the original, this was a no brainer - buy it! I don't need a demo or to read reviews. I know I am going to love it.  Sure enough. It is a fantastic successor to the original title.  This is more of the same, essentially - which is NOT a bad thing - but with much prettier graphics and now a more three dimensional feel to the musicscapes.  Music is totally subjective. So this is a non-argument - but I felt like Chime had a kind of shoegazer jazz vibe to it. Not my cup of tea, but I enjoyed it. I loved For Silence (Orbital fan) but the rest felt lacking to me. This one feels much more vibrant and the music has more of a variation to it.   The first also felt a little short. The price was fine. But the replayability was dependent on your love of a particular song or gameboard.   This looks like it is going to keep me far more entertained than the repeated sessions of For Silence of old.  Good stuff! If you like Tetis style puzzlers, this is right up your alley. It lacks the stress of a failed level - which suits me fine - and trades it for a clock. You can race the clock and cloak the board with your pieces or you can go at it slow and just enjoy yourself. There is no punishment and the reward for filling the board is just additional time - that can be dismissed if you are not feeling competitive.  Well worth the buy!",

Though I will say that I'm not a big fan of the WILDLY unnecessary DRM/server connection requirement.  It's also a bit annoying that at least one of the best songs starts off locked!",
