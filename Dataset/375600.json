Wide variety of classes.    Almost never hard to find a game.    Has potential to turn into a competitive dogfighting game.   CONS:    A few bugs.    Hard to change controls.    Not full controller support.    Short, complicated tutorial.  ",

If you need to know more, then read on. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- So I don't know how to review this game. If you go to the game's Reddit or see reviews, you see people who love the game and like it. However I don't see it, and the lack of updates since November 2015 feels wrong to me.   The game is OK. It works, and it has more than a few features. My biggest problem is the controls. The planes have no weight to them and that just wrong. No matter what other good Dogfighting game you look at you will find that the planes have weight to them. Crimson Skies had weight in their aircraft, and Rouge Squadron had weight on its ships. No matter what the biggest problem with the game is the bad controls. The lack of weight not only feels wrong, but you also don't get a good sense of where the ground is and where the sky is.   And the fact the developers say the game's finished, and they haven't updated it since November of 2015, is just wrong. The game needs a few refinements here and there. And they could add so much more to it. This is only the base of what could be a good game, and it's not a good game right now.",

I also love it for it plentiful content but trailer up above mentions that already so no sence in me reiterating it. The only weakness that I can pick out is the fact that it has no player base so most of the time you're left to verse bots which are inhumanly difficult. I'm talking making nearly every shot with a machine gun difficult. The should also be a bit more options when hosting a server, such as an option to turn those bots off or change their difficulty and definitely the option to set a level cap for your server because I had a level 37 enter onto my server of level 1-5's and he was continually reking us. Overall though a pretty good game that I recommend you buy especially if you have real life friends you can play with.",
