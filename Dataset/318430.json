Read steam discussion threads for more information. 3) Buggy mechanics. You don't see it in the beginning, but the more you play, the more it becomes noticeable. 4) Poorly balanced boss battles. Insane difficulty (it's the hardest one) requires extremely fast reaction, but even if you are good enough, you can lose due to bad luck or buggy mechanics.  Who knows, maybe in the future developers will fix all bugs of this game, but right now I don't recommend to buy this game.",

There are many different ways to kill yourself, such as jumping out of the screen, jumping into spikes, jumping into axes, getting blown up by TNT or nitro blocks, having a block drop on your head, and even getting hit by a spikey ball. These kind of levels are usually the puzzle kind of levels. There are also some levels where you have to not die and dodge every obstacle that comes your way. These kinds of levels are the platformer kind of levels. I haven't seen a game like this since Mr. Karoshi, a game that came out on the IOS many years ago. This is a great game that is very unique and fun to play. There are four worlds with about 10 levels in each world, so you almost never get bored! There are also minigames, such as battle, which is multiplayer, and survival, where you try to dodge obstacles and survive as long as you can. Great game.",

            "review_text": "Don't buy this game. NEVER buy this game. The only reason i have it is because it was 14 cents. And I still don't think it's worth it. This game is just a simple puzzle game, and if it was free, it wouldn't be that bad. But because you are required to pay for it, that just makes me angry, when there are games almost exatly like this (if not better) that are FREE, and you have to pay 2 dollars (at the moment 14 cents) for this, makes it bad. So, i'll say it again. DO. NOT. BUY. THIS. GAME.  ok, i think i'll actually review it now. So, this game, like I said, is a puzzle-platformer were the goal is to kill yourself each time. while the goal is unique, the gameplay isn't, basicly you push blocks around and blow up other boxes, whle activating fans to get through the level. only problem is, the game isn't direct, and, if you're like me, your gonna screw up a lot, which is very fustrating. i didn't have fun playing it, and like with most puzzle platformers (FREE ONES) i got bored, but i PAID for this, so i feel very let down. I'm sure that it gets somewhat better as you go along, but don't even bother, just go to armorgames and pick a game from there and save your money. So, there you have it, dont buy this game for full price, and if you REALLY want it, pick it up now and sell the trading cards that you get so you get your money back. But, i still think thats a bad idea. Just keep your money, and play a free game, instead of one that should be free.",

With the main objective being your own death, you'd expect at least some funny and satisfying death animations.

            "review_text": "Okay, so after playing through the first world and most of the second I've come to the conclusion that this game has a lot of artificial difficulty going for it.  Now please hear me out before the inevitable before you start throwing “git gud” comments at me. I completed Super Hexagon, Super Meat Boy, 1001 Spikes etc. So I do feel somewhat qualified to point out these supposedly “flaws” as the average gamer I am.  Most of the bosses are pretty much purely RNG based with a very low amount of positioning yourself out of danger's way. Too often i find myself in situations where death simply was unavoidable. It happens so frequently that it makes me wonder if that was supposed to be this game's gimmick?  Now, I’m not strictly talking about the Insane bosses I would also like to point out the at times unresponsive controls which lead me to fall into a pit or to leap over a platform because the moving platform I jumped from gave me too much momentum. This can get very frustrating and random obstacles like the sand pits in level 2-8 with no apparent purpose suddenly starts to make sense, they were put there to make backtracking take even longer and the player’s experience so much worse at other times it is the weird level design that gets me (yes I’m looking at you level 2-4 with awkward jump you had to make which apparently is “skill based”) or subtle hints like “Gur nafjre vf sbhe naq fvk” which I’m sure has a logical explanation to it that I’m just too stupid to translate, only problem is that the text disappears after 5 seconds and no, there’s no way for you to go up to the sign and read what it said again as it would in any normal game, you have to exit the level to read it again.  All this is disregarding the various bugs like when I had to exit a level and “Restart and “Exit” did literally the same, forcing me to either complete the level or close the game or getting pushed into a block so that I couldn’t move and had to restart.  Final words: I’ve tried my best to make this review as objective as I could but would I recommend this to anyone else? Definitely not! Where does this game shine? I think the idea of having to lose your life is a neat idea that I’m pretty fond of, it’s what hooked me in the beginning but I’m afraid that’s all...not even the music which I know is subjective is very repetitive to me.

Projectiles do not follow a ballistic arc which makes dodging things (or getting hit intentionally) very hard for anybody who has experience with gravity. These problems result in platforming that is mediocre at best and enraging at worst.  The puzzle aspect was good at first, but that is quickly replaced with 'not puzzles'. The main 'not puzzles' are the poorly executed platforming described above, and levels that require you to go through them several times to memorize ♥♥♥♥ (the thing a hate most in gaming).  If you want a puzzle game, get something by Zachtronics. If you want a difficult platformer, get one of the hacked Mario roms.

As you can tell, this game is extremely annoying at times, not entirely because of the time sensitive platforming and complex puzzles, but because the developers thought it would be funny to add dumb ways to change how the player thinks about the game in order to keep them stuck on a level until they look up the solution to it online. Other than this, the game is pretty inventive and challenging when it comes to solving puzzles that make sense within the 'rules' of the game.  Pros: Interesting, dark take on a typical platformer Lengthy and challenging gameplay Fluid movement and responsive controls (sometimes to a fault) Profitable due to cheap sale price and card value  Cons: Occasional very stupid solutions to levels Frustrating lack of USEFUL in-game tips, especially when new game features are introduced Consistent need to reset the level because of one accidental movement  Overall:  8/10  Simply buy it on sale, play through the first world or so, and sell cards to profit.",

Through thought-provoking, mind-boggling riddles I have unlocked the true meaning of Squishy the Suicidal Pig. It's not just a game about a pig who needs to kill himself to be reunited with his family, it's a direct message to the player who assumes his role. My mother told me that her patrilineal side contains an ancestor who embarked on the famous Mayflower, that which the known pilgrims took to the Americas. I've always wanted to see for myself, and so lately I've wondered if I could kill myself and meet him.  Just like Squishy, I forgot. I forgot that suicide is a sin, and that doing so would place me in hell. But, in the game, Squishy is given a chance to redeem himself, to challenge Satan and rejoin his mother and father. If Squishy can do it, we can do it. Want to meet an ancient ancestor in the afterlife? Kill yourself. And if you pass the trials, you'll be granted infinite knowledge.  Kys",

You will curse a lot, but when you get something done, you'll feel great. Once you've tilted so much that you are done with life, you will feel calmer than ever. Can't really describe it.

How you ask? It'll make you want to commit suicide at points, just like this pig. It gives you these suicidal thoughts because of the fact that if you push a box or blow something up or die... You have to start the level over.  However, the dying part brings me to my next point. In a game where you're supposed to die to advance, I have found that in at least one level, if you die, you lose, which in my opinion, contradicts with the point of the game.   Overall, this game is completely worth the money and y'all should buy it now. Thank you for your time, bye.",
