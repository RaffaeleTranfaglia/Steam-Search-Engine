Still can prove quite fun til you figure out how to tweak the folks to get them to do what you want. At some point, it loses its charm, but you may have a bit more respect for your politicians by then, if you're not wondering why they haven't implemented all the policies you did to have a socialist utopia. 3/5",

            "review_text": "For a political game, it sure doen't like you making choices. I'll give you an example. Say that I'm the Labour Party. The Labour party does not make decisions based upon the Daily Mail, but rather based upon their fat cat union paymasters. So when the Labour party starts to impliment these Union policies the Daily Mail doesn't like it and SENDS OUT HITMEN TO KILL THE PRIME MINISTER. The same could be said when playing as a liberal, although you would have to add THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND to the list. You know, the tame and timid church of dwindling numbers and no real passion? OK, OK, it may very well be Muslims, but it wasn't a masque that denounced me a month before my assassination.  Try to impliment the policies you think are the best and you will be killed. Betray your voter base who wants these reforms and you may just get a coup from your ministers. Quite frankly, I agree with my ministers, I want to run a liberal government. It's just a shame that UKIP and the Church of England disagree, because it makes the game dull. To play you must now tow the center ground, pander to all groups and believe in nothing. DId Thatcher pander to socialists? She most certainly did not, nor did Reagan or the two Bush's. Where they assasinated by Socialists? NO?!? WHY THE HELL NOT? Let me put it this way, if Ed Miliband came in, do you really think he would listen to the 50 year old UKIP voters who read the daily mail and wouldnt vote for his party anyway, especially given that they dont give him any money? Of course not! So would he be assasinated? The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is not some bannana republic that was just liberated from the tenticles of spain and doesnt know how to run an election!  What this game does allow you to do, is manage the budget, which is reletively easy to do since it devoted over 25% of the UK budget to the military. just reassign the funds. OH BUT YOU TOUCHED OUR PRECIOUS MILITARY, I'M SHOCKED! I'LL BE WRITING A STRONGLY WORDED ARTICLE TELLING OUR HITMEN TO GO FOR THE THROAT! I'm one of the only people devoted to politics you'll ever meet, so when I say this game is dreadful, that not even my latent interest in the topic was enough to carry me through, I god damn mean it.",

            "review_text": "I waited for this to go on sale 75% off (4,75). I find it encredibly addictive and fun to play, though most of the time playing it goes with thinking about what to do, and how to solve the problems that come up. Try to make the society you want, and you will fail. Try to make a society that works, and you will succeed. If you're not into politics, this is NOT the game for you. Every game you start with a solid debt and a boatload of problems that you have to get rid off. Without ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ off too many voters. It's a lot harder than it sounds. There's no mercy in this game. If you ♥♥♥♥ off the voters, they'll punish you at once. A lot of what you can do has inertia effects, and may take up to two years to come to full effect. Most tax-fiddeling will be instantaneous though. Your cabinet gains (or loses) political power, which is what you use to pass laws. If the public are dissatisfied you lose some, and if they're happy you gain some. And without it, it's very limited what you can change or do. Theres 10 different countries to play, and they all have different voters and problems. If you're into modding and know a little programming, you can make your own countries, laws, events; and even choose your own voter behavior. You win the game if you manage to stay in office the full number of periods you've chosen to play (1-10), and you lose by not getting re-elected or by reaching the maximun allowed debt (differs according to country). It's not worth the full 20€ they want for it, but at 4.75 it's a pretty fun little game.",

            "review_text": "Political sims are hard to do well. The ones that try often go for a grand scale (eg Supreme Ruler) and tend to fall flat. The only quite successful one which comes to mind is Shadow President. Democracy 2 is more confined than most, limiting the outside world and turning everything into sliders and charts. It's a nice try, but aspects of it really don't come off well at all.   Superficially, it seems quite good. The interface is fairly well designed, presenting most of your key info on a single screen - although the inability to change the resolution (leaving me, on a widescreen monitor, with either bits of the interface cut off or a window which can't be enlarged at all) is frustrating. There are a wide variety of potential policies, each with adjustable levels.  Unfortunately, the gameplay doesn't hold up. It is far to easy to 'game' the mechanics - just pour money into tech and universities and suddenly you are making massive income through technological advantage, which lets you build up everything else to win votes. The difficulty comes from random, arbitrary and unfair events. Random factors can completely decimate your popularity - slowly build up to an election winning lead over the course of years, then suddenly lose half your voters in one turn because the global economy drops.  It's also littered with grammatical errors, rather unfortunate for a game targeted at a more intellectual audience.  I wanted to like it, but found it a frustrating and unsatisfying experience.",

There's a lot of depth here for people who don't care about graphics. Sadly, there is no way that I can recommend this game at its asking price. 20 dollars is WAY too high. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNLESS IT'S ON SALE.",
