    "description": "In this simulation, the player works as the owner a large car park, on which the towed vehicles will be parked. A huge armada of different towing vehicles is ready to go. The trucks are on the road to find illegally parked cars. For each order you earn money, as being towed might be very expensive for the owner.",

            "review_text": "I thought I would try this out for a bit of a laugh, not really my cup of tea, but boy was I disappointment way more than what I expected.   I will probably NEVER play this game because of the poor quality. It is a shame, but they have reasonable graphics, but a lot of the time you find you have the car on the truck, but the game refuses to accept it and you just waste your time trying to resolve the issue. Some of the physics in the game are so bad also, for no reason the truck will just flip upside down. The driving control is bad and there is absolutely no way to remap the keys in the game at all. Just going into the options shows the sheer lack of settings.   There is no tutorial in the game, so you spend about an hour trying to work out how the bloody thing is supposed to work before you get a grip of the controls and then find out it ignores the fact when you do things right also. There doesn't seem to be anyway of knowing your progression also, just says pick up cars marked with RED dot, then half of them are too heavy and no way to know how to earn a larger truck.  Very POOR game in my opinion and certainly one for the masses to AVOID. When you think ONE GUY created Banished, what was the organisation thinking of to launch such a game in todays market place?  It is a shame that Steam does not offer a 'Game Guarantee' for satisfaction of a game for valued customers like myself to obtain a refund. If a member of staff reads this review, then please consider it, or at the very least remove this game from sale and save other customers the traumer!",

            "review_text": "First of all, let me start by saying that I would NEVER purchase this game by choice, the only reason I own it is because of a Simulator Bundle I purchased a while ago, and I figured that since I now own Towtruck Simulator 2015, I might as well give it a play to see what it's like. After less than 20 minutes of playing this game, I have concluded that it is nothing short of a joke.   Right off the bat it takes a huge nose-dive. There are no introductions, no tutorials on how to use the controls or hotkeys and the game is bugged horrendously, even the menus and dialogs are really bad. This is a very clearly unfinished game and the fact that it was released in it's current state is an utter disgrace. I honestly think that a group of 10 year old kids could come up with a more polished game than this in a shorter amount of time.   This is the perfect example of 'Shovelware', the game is an unoptimised mess, the controls are clunky to say the least and very clear issues have been completely overlooked. It seems as though this game was never even tested before it's release, but that wouldn't surprise me. United Independent Entertainment have become famous for their unplayable games.   I didn't expect much from this game from the beginning, Towtruck Simulator doesn't necessarily sound like something I would enjoy, nor does it sound like a game with much promise, but this is just ridiculous and the fact that they are asking for £10.99 for it on the Steam page is even more ridiculous.   Do NOT buy this game, not even during the Steam Sales. The only reason any of you should ever own this game is from a Bundle Package like how I acquired it.",

            "review_text": "Well, looking at the graphics on youtube, I thought this looked ok.  I'd like to tell you how I feel about it, but it wont run.  I got it running once, that was after it opened in a window which was only 1/4 on my screen...so I had to alt+enter to get it full screen, which crashed the game, all but once. I got the game running, once...and the graphics sucked. It was blurry, blocky and ran like crap. I've got Skyrim, which looks better, and is graphically much more intensive...and yet, tow truck sim runs like crap? I even turned the graphics down (why?) and it then ran with nothing appearing on the screen...except for a lot of blurred words and a timer. Also...why in gods name is the audio turned OFF as soon as you start? Jesus christ!!! This game is so ♥♥♥♥...",

The map is decently sized, although if the vehicles moved more quickly it would feel much smaller Hard city traffic with traffic lights and hundreds of cars -The roads are mostly empty Various Tow Trucks with crane and ramp  -Two crane trucks (small and large) and one ramp truck... Simulation of all hydraulic functions  -At slower than real speed! 3 game modes -Finally, something true  Realistic sound effects and atmospheric music -Okay, the first time I launched the game I had no sound whatsoever. It turns out sound is muted by default. If you have sound on at all you get what sounds like someone sitting at the side of the road with a mic, just cars driving by, no matter where you are. The vehicles make no sounds whatsoever. The horn is a different pitch every time you hit it, as is the handbrake sound (spacebar) even though the handbrake does nothing. The music is terrible, too. High score list for all game modes -Sure, whatever  The game is actually decent, but wanting money for it is insulting. It feels like a beta version at best. Your truck and all the hyrdaulic systems are stupidly slow to the point that you get bored and just give up. I'm glad I'm not the one that paid for this.",
