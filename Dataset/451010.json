            "review_text": "I should have bought this sooner.  I didn't take this game seriously when I first saw it but after seeing a few videos on youtube I gave it a shot. From the trailers it looks like a standard Tower Defense game, and it is. It's not redefining the genre or anything. But what trailers can't really capture is how well it does VR.  The UI works well and is for the most part intuitive. While the right controller acts as the mouse the left one controls the map, you can move the game world, turn it around, zoom in and out. Of course, if you're doing roomscale you can just walk around the map. The game also scales seamlessly between giant mode and standing right in the action, allowing you to switch between romscale and seated on the fly. One second you are towering over the map, managing your units, then you're standing right next to a tower you just built as it starts firing at little kitties.  I've always thought that the Vive would be perfect for strategy games and this game confirms it.",

As long as you meant you wanted to blow them to smithereens that is.   Good tower defense game. with a nice VR twist, highly recommended if you liked Bloons TD5 or similar.  Also, one of the best features in my opinion is the interesting zoom feature, though it isn't for the faint of stomach, (motion sickness). It's just a little satisfying getting to stand next to your guns as they destroy your enemy.  10/10 Would send cats into the stratosphere again.",

The detail of the towers, their sheer variety, and level design is awesome.  The last 2 levels are so jam packed with baddies that my PC had a heart attack, but that aside, I can't find fault with the game. I would have made the mistake of passing this up. I love it.  This game earns Zim's stamp of approval and a must buy from me. Well done, devs. Well done.",

Its like you 'grow' as you get closer to the table, which bends all kinds space/time upchuck properties. If the table could be fixed in space at a certain size (like 'Castle Must Be Mine') id give this game almost a perfect score. Please please change the movement mechanics or at least provide thjis as an option for those with weak-to-normal upchuck thresholds. Let those with ironguts use the current method.",
