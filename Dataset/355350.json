            "review_text": "Excellent job balancing a variety of upgradeable loot against increasingly-difficult enemies. Later levels require more skil, as enemies have new behaviors, bullets and patterns. This isn't a 'that blue enemy is red and has twice as many hit points, this time' kind of shooter. Serious care was taken to make sure that the difficulty is progressive and well-balanced.  Meaningful differences in weapons and their variety of upgrades, with good reasons not to have all your guns facing forward.   The difficulty is pretty casual, even on the hardest setting. You'll have to replay most 2 or 3 times to get a perfect score (which affects drops), and you'll occasionally come up against a level you don't scrape through with a C rank, on your first try. Died 3 times in the first 20 levels, so not too bad.  The worst inventory management interface ever developed. The button labeled '(un)equip'? Neither equips nor unequips weapons. When I want to unequip a weapon, I either sell it off, or click the '(un)equip' button and wave my mouse around the screen clicking for a few seconds, before it returns me to the menu and the item isn't equipped any more. Still haven't figured out what I do to make that happen. Weapons have upgrade slots, you can rotate them any direction, and are in a list of easy-grab menu boxes. But there's no drag and drop. Every change you make requires as many clicks as you could conceive of it possibly taking. There are detailed stats measured in arbitrary, meaningless units (wonderful! My gun fires 10 'titan miles.' After completing the first 20 levels, I still have absolutely no idea how far that is). It's an obtuse, clunky, horrendous inventory system.  And the menu bleeps sound exactly like Skype alerting you to a new message. Why would you do that?",

            "review_text": "An interesting shoot-em-up with horizontal scrolling. After levels, you receive weapon parts and money to upgrade your ship so before long, you'll be firing many different weapons (I was closing in to ten different weapons at once) which keeps the difficulty somewhat low, so if you're not a fan of this genre, you might still want to give this one a try.  It has an infinite levels mode for people who seeks such challenge. Still, you'll be responsible for half the clutter on the screen.  Definitely worth a try for its low asking price.",
