            "review_text": "I love this game. I can already say it is the best theme park game i ever played.  This game is so great because it is limitless in regards to building and creativity. The amount of themes looks okay but once you start combining items from other themes together you can basically make any theme you can imagine. Lovely graphics, art design and the detail is extraordinary and looks so realistic.  There is a good amount of Flat rides, a great amount of Coasters, 2 Transport rides and they even added some water rides like the log flumes and river rapids. You can also make Darkrides and there are options to set trigger events to your rides and coasters. For those who like their own music better then the ingame music, wich is great, you can add custom music to the rides and speakers.  The park management is very in-depth and allows you to do just about everything you need as a park manager.  My final verdict (based on theme park games): 10/10",

            "review_text": "I will put together a better review once I have been able to play Planet Coaster for longer.  For now I have to highly recommend this game based only on the 4.5h I have played in a sandbox map to see how the custom roller coaster creation has evolved since the now ancient roller coaster tycoon 1 &amp; 2 [witch I still class as some of my favourite games].  It's a huge jump, looks a little overwhelming to start with, the grid system of old has gone allowing for every corner to be as you set it. There are a large number of loops, inversions, and pre set banking's, but even after you have placed these you can adjust there size, width and angle to attached track. With the inclusion of an autocomplete and snap to function you will easily be able to finish the track. You can also test the track as you are building it allowing for tweaks as you build helping to prevent scenarios like too high loops that would cause the ride to fail.  Big + You can ride your coaster from any seat or even a more cinematic view. Never going to a theme park again now I can ride my own coasters.  From what else I have seen the management side [research, staffing and so on] it is somewhat on the basic side, like the games before, but this is far from a negative point it's enough to customise what you need without taking too much from the focus of building a park how you want it.  I will easily be spending 100's of hours on this just creating coasters.  My hat goes off to the development team, you have made an amazing game.",

            "review_text": "I love this game. I can already say it is up there with the original Roller Coaster Tycoon and Theme Hospital as one of my favourite management games ever.   In terms of gameplay, the game provides sufficient depth. You can manage your staff (training, area and task allocation); your rides (building, maintenance, themes, refurbishment, priority queues); and high level management such marketing campaigns and finances. There's definitely more that escapes me. With that said, I think there is room to add more depth and mechanics to the game in future DLC.  You can make some really good-looking parks thanks to the game's great graphics and also the multitude of scenery and prop items you can place. The game allows you to build sophisticated scenes by letting you place various props on top of each other, and creating a sort of story for an area. In the pirate themed scenarios (the only scenarios I've played so far), you can make use of scaffoldings, ship wrecks (I'm talking multi-level hull wreckage), barrels and animated characters such as pirates and guards to create skirmish scenes.   Speaking of animated props, you can tie those to triggers which are arbitrarily placed on ride tracks to make for awesome events. They aren't just for looks either; they will boost the appeal of the ride and will also make things more interesting for guests that are waiting in queues. If you take the effort to do this, guests won't mind waiting 10 minutes in the queue.   The only thing that worries me is the amount of content. The game supports Steam Workshop, but it doesn't look like there are scenarios on the workshop. The game has 12 scenarios which I don't think will take me more than 20-30 hours.",

And Planet Coaster hasn't quit improving. This was the theme park simulator that made me care about how the park looked as well as functioned. Frontier has truly built something they can be very proud of, and even more proud of how people have used it. How can I know that? Simple: the gameplay trailer uses parks made by people.  Thank you Frontier, for making me believe.",

As RCT World kept getting passed around developers like a cheap hooker the outlook grew dimmer and dimmer.  But the developers that brought us RCT2 DLC and RCT3 and its DLC were already working on a new title. Planet Coaster. And a promising looking one at that. And boy have I been having fun with this game. If I had to use one word to describe this game's greatest aspect it would have to be Freedom. The way the game lets you take total control on how you want to build is fantastic, the terrain and building tools are simple to use and extremely effective at creating exactly what you wanted to create. The fact that you are allowed to clip scenery and buildings into terrain and each other already frees you up to use the given tools in so many creative ways.  Really the only issues I have with this game are small quality of life problems.  If you enjoyed RCT3 this is pretty much a must buy, it is well worth the price.",

Pros: -Absolutely amazing graphics -- fantastic job devs, they're not too taxing but also look amazing -Ability to basically put anything wherever -- I can add rocks to rides (as long as the carts/vehicles won't hit them) -Ability to really customize your park -- the fact that I can change up what a store looks like is something I didn't know I needed -Lack of real learning curve -- yes, my first park is terrible but it's not too bad compared to what I expected it was  Cons -I feel like there's a lack of scenery -- I haven't checked the workshop yet and I'm *hoping* the workshop has some good scenery -Paths are a pain, tbh, but they work and are MUCH better than grid-based paths  tl;dr: Absolutely amazing game mechanics, while there are some annoying features (paths; lack of a ton of scenery) this game by far beats out any other creator EVER.

I have been backing this game literally since day 0, I purchased as much as I could from the start with as much money as I had to help back this game to its fullest. And what I can tell you now is that I LOVE this amazing game, the devs have been amazing on taking thoughts feedback and talking with the community to help built one of the most rounded and most beautiful game I think that has existed in this series. Props to Frontier and their entire team for not only making me feel apart of the family but also making me a little guy that means nothing to game developers feel like I'm in the decision making room with them, and this had to be the same for everyone else.  PASSION!  This team has shown how passionate they have been through the entire process. I have never in my life seen a team that has brought in the community to make sure things are being done the way we would play them. Taking our feedback and their skills to develop such a immerse game has been out of this world (Elite Dangerous Here). Through thick and thin with others developers, this team has pulled out all of the stops, making nothing fall short.

            "review_text": "  TL;DR: This game is absolutely fantstic, and the people who made it are fantastic.  (Full disclosure, I won this game in a giveaway contest, but still would've paid full price for it had I not won the giveaway)  Long version: This game is to the 'Rollercoaster Tycoon' series what 'Cities Skylines' is for the 'Simcity' Series.  PROS: (Too many to list, honestly. I'll try to mention the big ones that come to mind.) -First of all it's FUN. Very fun. Very very fun, and a great heir to the RCT throne, to the point where I don't see myself going back to older RCT games for any reason other than nostalgia or just to try their scenarios again. -It has both a managment aspect and a sandbox aspect. -The graphics are BEAUTIFUL -Wonderfully realistic roller coasters -Buildings and track pieces are not restricted to a grid, allowing for flowing shapes and much more realistic parks than any other game, yet grids do exist, they only pop up while constructing buildings, though, and can be edited fairly easily. -The UI makes it so it's friendly to both pedantic coaster geeks(such as myself) who want to build overly realistic, high detail amusement parks, while also being friendly to the genereal public player who doesn't want to build the next disneyland but just wants to putter around and build a nice little, possibly unrealistic amusement park. -Sandbox and the ability to build whatever construction you can think of pretty much give this game years of replayability. If modding support ever happens, this could easily live as long as RCT2 and RCT3 did. -The attention to detail is staggering. From guest animations, to the things you can micromanage, it's all wonderful. -One of the most versatile, yet user friendly editors in any game I've ever seen. You can build insanely detailed and intricate ride layouts or buildings fairly easily. -I can't stress this enough: The developers are a FANTASTIC bunch and I've never seen game devs this closely involved in their community. Whenver something bothered us and we'd post about it on the forums, it would get fixed. Features planned for the game (Such as Go Karts) were delayed because they saw the community had other features they wanted to see on release (such as water rides). They took everything we liked about RCT3 and kept it, and took everything we didn't like about RCT3 and fixed it. They are wonderful and I definitely encourage supporting them by buying this game. Good game dev-community relationships should be rewarded.  CONS: -Because of how detailed all the rides are... Ride selection is unfortunately small. More will be released in the future, I'm sure, but it would've been nice to have more to begin with. Some fairly basic rides are still missing from the game. -So is the number of Scenarios (12 secnarios overall. They're more challenging than I expected, and I've yet to finish them all, but still would've liked more!) -No scenario editor. -Some rides have built-in theming, and don't have generic alternatives. Most rides are generic but it would still be nice to have generic versions for more of them. -At the time of writing this there isn't any mod support yet, nor do I know if any is planned. -Various minor issues here and there such as a minor bug or a less-convenient feature. Mostly they're pretty harmless and get fixed when noticed by the devs.  Conclusion: If you like amusement park building-and-managing games, you absolutely can't ask for a better one. Replayability will depend on how creative you are. If you're not very creative, playability will probably end once you finish all the scenarios, at least until they release an expansion pack of some sort. If you ARE creative and enjoy building creative things - sandbox mode alone can keep you playing for years on end. The game isn't perfect, but it's as close as I've ever seen an amusement park game get!",

All the animations and graphics would be too much for a PC to handle and they would focus too little on the actual gameplay and scenario's. However after seeing the first Alpha I just had to buy and try it. I payed extra, but it was worth it! When the second Alpha was released I was sold, this game would be great and would be the proper sequel to the RCT franchise. Then Alpha 3 rolled around and we got even more stuff. Now they just announced the number one requested feature would make it on launch: water rides. We did not get 1 ride, no we got 2 water rides! During the alpha Frontier listened to the community and improved the path system, the color picker, added custom music and even let the community design one of the in-game mascots! This game is already great and I'm sure this game will be expanded with free and paid DLC in the future, all by listening to the community!",

My experience with the Rollercoaster Tycoon games has been inconsistent at best. I got the first game out of a cereal box, never played career mode, and focused mainly on building rides that would kill people. I skipped two, forgot about the series, and eventually picked up RCT3, where I ignored ride and park building, and mainly wasted time building groups of me and my friends and following them around. I proceeded to forget about the series once again.  But when a youtuber I follow started doing videos on Planet Coaster a couple of weeks before it's release, showcasing the creative freedom the game gave you and just how far Frontier's physics engine has come since the first RCT game, I couldn't help but get interested in the sandbox and park management genre again, in a way I never have before.  My few hours in the game so far (almost four at the time of writing this) have been spent mostly in the sandbox, getting used to the controls and playing with the landscaping tools to see what was possible. Today however, I started the career mode scenarios, and started to get into the gritty details of park building.  There's so much possibility in Planet Coaster. The blueprints created by other players in the Steam Workshop are a huge example of this. It's fun to play, easy to get into and customize, and a worthy successor to the RCT name. If you have the time, are interested in playing a management and building sim, or remember the original RCT and wonder where the creators ended up, pick this game up and give it a go!",

The new track system is far more intuitive to the average user who got lost in the twists and turns of looping their own coaster together. The ability to cobble together custom buildings from all the game parts (including Workshop mods) will make this game into a modders paradise.

Bad: - The filter needs a lot of work, Ex. if you filter for Sci-Fi you will only get a small portion of what you would consider Sci-Fi - Some objects are very hard to find, partly due to the small UI and partly due to the filter system, you basically have to know what some objects are called if you want them or spend 10 minutes looking for them - Can't start without the path and half of it is out of the boundary so you're stuck with the red path at the entrance.",

Just a smile, thats it, just a massive smile on my face as i played this game. i speant 5 mins watching a little girl in line for a ride , and the emotions she displayed physicaly were to say at the least AMAZING. Im so impressed with the quality of animation , programming and beauty of the enviroment. this is an amazing game in design and form. the peeps are the best i have ever seen in over 40 years of gaming. I think this will be classified as a work of art when people realise computer games can be as good or better than any masterpeice of art or music. which this has both in spades. Excellent work Frontier. Well done.",

It keeps everything we liked about it and makes the bits we didnt like about it better, such as the grid that you had to build everything on in RCT3 or the rollercoaster building tool that forced you to build sections that fit to the grid aswel! If your one of the few that likes to make realistic parks like me then this is also the game for you. I can not think of anything bad with it especially when the developers have been working really hard to send out updates and I don't think they are going to stop doing that soon either.

Second, You can't assign staff to specific areas. The closest thing you can do is setup an entertainment point for entertainers, or setup work rosters for mechanics. The janitors seem to walk around doing whaterver they feel like doing.  Third, There is no path fence option, it is really hard to make nice neat walls or fences that contour to the paths.   Fourth, I don't think adding scenery items around coasters does anything to raise excitment, fear, etc. I add items around coasters, triggers, etc. Nothing seems to change the ratings maybe I am wrong about this but I don't see the rating change.",

            "review_text": "After playing RCT 1-4 and also this game i am some kind of happy and disappointed.  If you dont want to read all of this just know: This isn't a Tycoon gameplay. Its a great game with the same topic but its in no way a tycoon game.    Why am i saying this?  If you also played RCT you will know that RCT 2 was the best part ever. RCT 3 was pretty awsome too but not quite as good. So what is it that makes a Tycoon game awsome?   Challenges: 15 hours of gameplay and i didnt really find one in here. Where are the 'impossible to solve' challenges? I mean as soon as it gets hard just raise the prices and add some random scenery... is that all?  Some kind of realism: People dont take 800$ with them when they visit a park and they also in no way never ever spend like 20 bucks on a burger or a ride. I know its a game but sorry, this is just too much, it totally feels like randomness.  Coasters, coasters and yes: Coasters: What really triggers me are mainly two things: how can it be that my major earning arent the coasters? Maybe the 20 Dollar burgers and milkshakes might be the answer (Btw. People earn like 150/month ?!?) . Second Point is that Coaster designer: Yes its something new and yes its seems very flexible BUT if i loose focus one more time by clicking on that rail im going insane. Also why doesnt right/left scale with my camera view? and where is more diversity and creativitiy about coasters themselve? they all look different but mainly most of them feel the same.   Paths: Well... No... Building Paths in this game is possible, yes. its creative and it also can be precise. So, isnt there a way to make this more easy? changing build modes, activating grid, disable grid, build, erase, .... dang it. This (and you will build alot of paths) just really doesnt feel good. Still Beta in my Opinion.    I could give you many more things that trigger me alot but this would mean i need to compare to another game and then this wont be a review anymore.    Still. If you just love Coasters: Buy this game. It is very detailed and you can really do alot in here. What i like most is that this is some kind of 'new' game. There is no reason to compare it to any game cause its just different and also it is fun to play.   I would buy it again but i dont think i will play it exzessiv, cause i think it will get boring in a few weeks due to the lack of challenging content (making complicated buildings isnt a challenge to me - and also has nothing to do with beeing a Tycoon).   So lets just sum this up:  We have a nicely designed game that completly feels different than any other similar game. Its something new that will for sure fascinate you but i dont think it will last long... but its not up to me to decide on that.  In my case i think i will for sure play this for a while but on the long term this game is missing too much to me.   To the haters: This game also has some bugs and crashes happen like evry 90-120 mins.   Not sure if i just told u guys anything but still. If i was able to help or you just liked to read this im happy :) Cheers",

The possibilities are truly staggering and it should be viewed more as 'Minecraft with roller coasters' than as a successor to the original RollerCoaster Tycoon franchise.  The Career mode and Challange Parks are interesting diversions but due to the lack of any real consequences for screwing up and the anemic park management, the true star of this game is the Sandbox mode where you are limited only by your imagination. The controls are intuitive and easy to pick up and the tools for altering terrain are some of the best I've ever experienced in a video game. This game really raises the bar when it comes to sandbox-building.  Be forewarned though. This game requires an extremely powerful computer to run and even with an i7 clocked to 4.6ghz and a GTX 1080, this game will struggle to achieve playable framerates if you go overboard with scenery and fill the park with close to 10,000 guests. There still seems to be some bugs and optimization issues as of the official launch of Nov, 17 but nothing game-breaking in my opinion (unless you densely fill the park, boarder-to-boarder with guests and scenery) so I would altogether recommend this game for anyone who wants to build the park of their dreams.",

Even making custom scenery to put in game because of the lack of support and content years after. The community kept RCT3 alive. Finally someone took notice. Frontier Games did. Now we have a successor we can boast about!   I have to say that Planet Coaster is THE BEST roller coaster / park management sim out there. It will be hard to top it. They really outdid themselves. Every detail has been looked at and tweaked to perfection. You can literally do anything in this game. To putting your own music for rides to setting up an Express Pass/Priority Pass line in your queues; just like in real parks.   The lightening is spectacular. The coasters look, feel, and taste so real. The tools they give you are incredibly powerful. Even in Alpha stages, creators were making incredible things with such little pieces. It was at this point where I knew there was something special here. This is the game we've been waiting twelve long years for.   The BEST part of this process was the communication aspect. Frontier Games was able to keep a clear two way communication system with their fans and players throughout the entire development of this game. We molded this game with Frontier. I'm proud to say that. Try this game out. You won't be disappointed. I promise you!  Now we just need VR Support :D",

Right now it's in beta and I haven't had much time to play because I'm in class, but I figured I should put a review on here since Planet Coaster so far has none.  As a coaster simulation game this game excels in every aspect. If you love to go into every little detail of creating a park, this game has the resources to let you do that. and it rewards you by having the guestws love your park more for the extra design you put into it. But it doesn't limit those players who want to play for the challenge of just creating a park for finances.   Pros: - Visually stunning - Nested Complexity - Easy to get into for new players - Well Designed Coaster Editor - Beautiful scenery and building editors - Great AI, they actually feel like real guests  Cons: - literally nothing (maybe the paths sometimes)  TL;DR Planet Coaster is an amazing game and you will not regret purchasing it.

One valid criticism is that there is too much freedom when it comes to placing the scenery items, it makes it hard to be precise. The buildings have a grid system so it can be easier with them to be precise. Building the coasters is Meh, just what you would expect, no more no less. My biggest problem is with the placment of paths. Paths do allow for some good looking smooth curves but you just cant do certain things and the precision not there. Even when using the grid system you still cant do what you want with the paths. Overall, its a good game and is fun. If you liked RCT3 then you will like this one.

I was able to, over the span of several hours, build a multi-village themepark where each village had rides and attractions connected via monorail. I was able to 'use and abuse' the assets such as walkways and tilt them on their sides with wooden flagpoles to make improvised fences for my villages.  It is a fantastic game and definitely harkens back to the old days of RCT, I'd say definitely reminding me of RCT1 and RCT2.  Pros - Fun design aspects, maximum control, details down to how your burgers your food stands server look.  Cons - Controls like Maya or Python so it takes a little getting use to, occasional crashes when tabbing out, but I think the release patches and final-beta patch resolved that, occasionally rides will get into a fail-loop and repeatedly require maintinence, but that also seems to have been resolved.",

Planet Coaster improves the graphics and look of RCT3 and builds on its successes by giving us exceptional management tools and a huge box of content to be as creative and innovative as never before.   What makes Planet Coaster such a complete amusement park sim is that the developers did is tested out a small portion of the game little by little perfecting each system before releasing it in entirety. Terrain editor, staff, park, guest, ride management and scenary editor are all top notch and are perfect. Physics engine and riding the rides are better than ever before. Although, to be stuck building coasters and other tracks piece by piece instead of similar to Roller Coaster Tycoon World's spline system, seems like one step backwards.   Planet Coaster is easy to play, and it's a beautiful game. It looks like a game that was released in 2016. It's fun, and the options of how to make a park are endless. Only more content will come to this already massive game. There are so few things to say negatively about Planet Coaster. If you're just joining the genre, this game can be a bit scary since it doesn't really offer any tutorial to learn the ropes. But the game is not difficult to figure out.   Planet Coaster's success is built on the developers from Frontier who built RCT3 and they know what they're doing. It joins a list of successful park simulation games and offers a lot of fun and one of the (if not the) best choices for the greatest simulations out there. One gripe for me and I'm sure a lot of players out there is performance. You need a high end graphics card as well as a top level processor to run the game at an acceptable framerate with all your park content. Still, the performance is not a game breaker even if you have a lower rig. You can still enjoy all hours of time invested into this masterpiece.",

When I started playing this evening I was pretty tense but man, that music just melts all your troubles away, it's quite lovely.  tl;dr Is it worth your money? For £30 I'd say yes, however, with the stipulation that you liked RCT3 (Roller Coaster Tycoon 3).  If you weren't a fan of RCT3, I'd recommend picking this game up still, play it for an hour or so, if it's not your thing, Steam's new refund service is great for trying out games for an hour or so, then you know weather or not to pick it up in the sale!  8/10... cats  /\\_/\\  ( o.o )  &gt; ^ &lt;    Tangential - divergent or digressive, as from a subject under consideration: tangential remarks.

At the time of writing there are around a dozen flat rides, a few track rides and around 20 roller coaster types available - as well as a dozen or so shop types. The amount of scenery pieces feels like there could be more but the possibilities are enormous anyway. Until now, I have sticked to the sandbox mode. Perfecting every last detail by placing hundreds of stones and plants is very relaxing to me. Flying around in your own masterpiece and seeing thousands of little people enjoy it perfects the experience. If you are not looking for this kind of experience, the steam workshop support allow you to create great parks in less time.

I was able to, over the span of several hours, build a multi-village themepark where each village had rides and attractions connected via monorail. I was able to 'use and abuse' the assets such as walkways and tilt them on their sides with wooden flagpoles to make improvised fences for my villages.  It is a fantastic game and definitely harkens back to the old days of RCT, I'd say definitely reminding me of RCT1 and RCT2.  Pros - Fun design aspects, maximum control, details down to how your burgers your food stands server look.  Cons - Controls like Maya or Python so it takes a little getting use to, occasional crashes when tabbing out, but I think the release patches and final-beta patch resolved that, occasionally rides will get into a fail-loop and repeatedly require maintinence, but that also seems to have been resolved.",

This game is wonderful. It looks good, it feels good to play and it’s really fun. Everything a game should be of this genre.  At 44.99 USD (I had to pay AU) it’s a little pricy for the amount of content you get. True, there’s enough there to build your own scenes and buildings and whatnot but for items such as lights, bins chairs and topiaries..... It’s lacking some. I'm sure there'll be updates.... maybe.  I know there's a tutorial somewhere but I found I did not need one to get right into the game. It’s easy to build a park from scratch and make enough money to create a range of coasters... rides seem lacking a bit though, I expected more types of rides to fill up the amount of space you're given for your park. Scenery is great, but somewhat tiresome to have to place 'everywhere' in your park. I found terrain editing to be a pain too. But it’s all still so easy to use and there’s plenty of room for creativity. It also works really smoothly.  Unfortunately the game does crash on occasion, and to be honest I totally forgot what a game crash looked like until playing this; it’s been so long since I've experienced one. I have a very high end graphics card and top notch computer, it should not be crashing at all, but alas it does. Be careful not to place a path inside a ride or over-do your scenery. Treat it gently and you'll be find.  This game definitely sets the benchmark for future tycoon games like it! ;)",

I definitely recommend this game to anyone remotely interested, and if you're skeptical look on youtube to cement your decision, either way the developer has done a fantastic job here and deserves the success that they're receiving.

You'll need to actually make a good ride for people to enjoy it by making sure the turns are banked and that the car is not traveling too fast over bumps, and of course making sure it's not boring.  The campaign and challenge modes require you to balance your budget. You'll need to place shops, research new items, advertise, and pay back loans while trying to keep guests happy.

Decorating your park will likely consume half your time if you're into it, though the game makes the process simple. Placing objects is very easy with the tools provided, allowing you to freely place objects, snap them to a grid, and/or use an option to move objects along an axis for finer tweaking.  The visuals are appealing and the lighting effects look very nice. A lot of detail went into the assets like high-quality textures and creative animations. It's easy to tell if people are happy or not, like your janitors humming and twirling their brooms if they're getting paid well.  It's a little lacking in some content.

Unfortunately the game lacks modding, everything on the Workshop is just buildings and rides made in-game.

The game also has some performance problems as your park grows. It's CPU dependent and it will eventually become sluggish for players even with the highest end processors.

        {
            "review_text": "To preface the review: I absolutely love the game and have been thoroughly addicted to it since owning it. That being said it has quite a lot of problems that may put some people off, I won't mention some of the things that a lot of people have already talked about, but more about the business side of things which has been vastly expanded over past RCT games. Also, I should say that I have put hundreds, if not thousands of hours into old RCT games (2&amp;3 especially) and my favourite thing has always been designing roller coasters.  I'm sure you read other reviews, and if you haven't go and read them for the positive points (even though I am giving this game a positivie review, I would like to spend more time on the problems as I think that these are less documented than the good parts of the games). I want to give myself more time to talk about the bugs and problems with the games. So to quickly summarise: I think that this is a fantastically improved RCT 3 sequel, it took everything I liked about that game and expanded it greatly, especially in the terms of building and micro management.  Now onto the problems/bugs: -- One of the biggest problems at the moment is the poor framerates in parks with a lot of assests and/or guests, and especially when you're building things. My computer is not amazing (i5 3570k, 16gb ram, gtx 1060 6gb) but I only get as low as &gt;5 fps when building in a park with more than 5,000 guests, and around &gt;20 when not building ON THE LOWEST GRAPHICAL SETTINGS. I have read people on the forums with dual 1080s and OC top of the line CPUs getting 15-20 fps in similar scenarios: this definitely seems to be a problem with how the game is optimised, as when you start a park I get a solid 120fps on medium settings. You end up having to limit the amount of guests in your park, which defeats the point of building a bigger and better park for more people to come and spend money at. Developers have acknowledged and promised to fix this, but as of this review nothing has improved and people have claimed that FPS has actually gotten worse while constructing roller coasters.  -- The business side of the game is really lacking, the scenarios are all built around small parks that you need to fulfill a number of financial challenges to complete, but they all seem pretty easy once you work out the game's weird way of evaluating things (that are never explained). For example people go to different parts of the park for rides but not for shops, so you have to position shops right beside them or else they could be dying of thirst and not walk 10 steps out of their way to buy a drink for the shop around the corner. Also the coaster ratings (that define the worth of the ride) don't seem to correlate much with real life, there's a roller coaster on the workshop that just does one drop into an upside corner and turns back into the station. This ride costs $2050 and will make you at least that in a month, but spend $50,000 on a custom roller coaster that takes you an hour to build and it will only get you $3000-6000 a month only with you painstakingly making sure every part of the track is compliant with the arbitary rating system. If you build something realistic (I modeled a dive coaster after Valravn) then it's more than likely that the stats are going to be pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥. This all ties into the game's lack of instruction of how to make things better, and it's not always apparent. Park layout, the amount of shops for the guests, and the amount that guests are willing to pay for things (and what effects that) are never explained and nigh on impossible to work out without a lot of experimentation if at all. Also, like other people have mentioned: once you get over that first hurdle of profitability then there really is no challenge, you will just make money like there's no tomorrow! It feels like you are rewarded for working out the weird way the game works instead of building a beautiful and interesting theme park. This is better than the old games, granted, but still needs some improvement to create more challenege and more reward for your hard work.  -- The roller coaster designer is very powerful but it feels like you have to fight it in order to make smooth rides, and it also has a number of bugs/quirks to it. Like often if I make a number of roller coasters in one sitting then the ride option goes away until I restart the game. Also if you bank your track too slowly (using the in built smoothing option) then you often end up with jerky banking animations going between the sections of tracks. You need the smoothing tool to make a coaster that is anywhere close to smooth and that has good stats, but the smoothing tool also likes to destroy and of your own custom inversions, and the ones that come with the game are very limiting.  So there's a summary of the biggest problems I have with the game, there are a number of smaller problems like guests thinking that a queue is full when it clearly isn't, and trains on roller coasters getting stuck, but these aren't huge game limiting problems like the ones mentioned above (although that's obviously just my opinion). I hope that the developers will continue with support for the game, fixing these problems and introducing expansions like RCT (waterpark and animals would be amazing!).  Overall an amazing game for lovers of RCT 3 like me, but it has it's problems that may put off some.",

The game is great, most people reviewing are saying the same stuff I would, so I'm not going to say again about how much customization there is an how addicting it is.  The campaign/challenge is what I want to talk about. Some people are saying it's super easy and that the management side isn't in the game yet. This is uttery bull, there is just as much management in the game as RCT3 no joke. The campaign is pretty easy, some levels you can do in 30 minutes, some a few hours, this isn't meant to be a 10+ hour campaign park. The challenges however are not so easy. The hard mode on challenge parks are difficult, especially in the beginning as theres just no room for error really. In fact you kinda need to know what your doing to make it past 1 ride or else you'll just go into debt as hard mode allows NO loans ever, start with very low cash and a couple rides are unlocked.  Once your into it and get numerous rides down your going to start making money and profit as you should, I mean you shouldnt have a Six Flags size park and be 'skating' by on funds. Mid and late game are all very similar to RCT, you can start going in the red and losing lots of visitors and getting them back isn't that easy.   Overall I found the hard mode challenge mode a blast to build, customize and manage. This has plenty of entertainment for management as some people are complaining about. I do see why some are saying the campaign is too easy, this is somewhat true, so just knock it out and do a hard mode challenge, trust me you'll find it fulfilling.   Also, theres plenty of rides, I'd say 20+ small rides, 7 or so track rides, 15+ different coaster types.",

The game runs very smoothly and the graphics are very pleasing to the eye, though cartoony in some parts like character designs so if you do not like that, then it can be a negative. The coaster system itself is very familiar to me and probably many others who have played games like this before, as the controls are similar to Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 for example, but there are differences.  The few negative things I have seen in the game so far is that sometimes when you are playing around with buildings or scenery it can be a bit difficult to get the object snap into the right place, or be on the correct elevation, but this has not been a big problem to me, as it has usually only been few objects. The next problem I have found is that it's not always easy for newcomers to know what they are doing, and the controls are sometimes hard to remember, and things like looking underground to find that one thing you hid there for a trigger can be a bit difficult. Lastly but most importantly right now there is not enough scenery in my opinion, there are lots of nice choices, but there could be a lot more and I hope the game developers plan on adding more different objects we can use.  Also interestingly the visitors can be hit by a test coaster car, which can knock them out of the paths, this is quite silly thing to happen but amusing nonetheless.",

But what game can't improve, right?!?! One of the biggest, I think, is the save-ability of Terrain. Like, instead of just saving the coaster, track wise, it should save if you have set it on mountains or if it went underground. Also, the ability to save it with scenery items too. So, like the whole area around a coaster should be able to be saved. Not sure if that is doable. But, would be awesome if it could be implemented.  Until then, I will continue to enjoy the game.

Nevertheless, as the very first release of a game on this scale, the developing team did a fantastic job. Great thanks for all of you.  === updates ===  After around 40 hours of playing since the beta ended, personally I think this game might make people either feel deeply in love or suck. The greatest thing of Planet Coaster is its freedom. With some tricks, you may build anything crazy in the game. And I have seen crazy projects online which simply blow my mind. OK, let's talk about the down side and why some might think this game sucks. The career mode is interesting with clear objectives and fun, however, in other modes, the challenge currently isn't there. Yes, if you are new to this game, you may find yourself busy managing your park. But after some time, I just keep the game running at fast forward pace and wait for money. Talking about challenge, the current challenge mode is below my expectation. I thought the game would introduce unexpected events to my park and I have to manage the situation while keeping developing the park. Overall, there're good things about this game and there're bad. If you like building or creating, the sandbox mode is fantastic. And I assume you will spend hours and hours in the game. But if you like playing with clear in-game objectives and winning awards, after finishing the career mode with all stars, you might find yourself lost.",

Bought Theme Park Studio but it's stability has never been there and it's been in early access for more than 2 years (spent 200 hours there until I got frustrated their slow progress). I bought RTCW at early access and felt completely ripped off due to the false advertising of beta trials that never happened and they never even hinted at early access but made the decision after many pre-ordered the game thinking it was going to be released LAST YEAR. I have played a little now that it is released (one day before PC.....Abismal behavior but Atari must be desperate). It's more cartoon like and has way too many restrictions on where you can put things (everything interferes). Not sure about management since I really haven't given it many hours.  So now I am finally found the game I wanted. Ability to create, minimal rules to follow, and a developer who actually sticks to promises. I enjoy management side as well as the creativity and both are tweaking my interests here. The management is pretty easy but that's no different the RTC 1, 2 and 3.....they really didn't require much effort to meet the tycoon level in the scenarios.  Please make sure you check your system before purchasing. Many are whining when the didn't and find out they can't run. I tried it, hoping my old video card could handle it and it couldn't. That was MY risk, I clearly was not meeting the minimum requirements. Keep a dose of reality in expectations. The amount of computing power to run this advance graphics and track everything in the park is going to tax computers. Even the highest end computers are going to stuggle on the highest settings.   Narad.",

I was worried that I would not be able to play it, when I bought this computer specificially for this game. However, I was so wrong. The game works flawlessly for me on high settings, I haven't tried ultra, but I don't really need to as high looks absolutely amazing.   The soundtrack is amazing. They must have worked dilligently with psychologists and music therapists to capture music that actually inspires you and makes you feel creative and nostolgic all at once. Which is why I am glad for the Thrillseeker edition because I will find myself wanting to listen to it even when I'm not playing the game.  The graphics, quality, and dedication to this game are so evident. From how the team was on their Facebook page and livestreams to the posts they write. It's so obvious how much love went into this. Unlike their competitor who is clearly more worried about money for an unfinished game. Frontier really set the bar on what it means to be a top notch community manager with Bo. Congrats, because that made me want to buy the game even more.   One thing is I don't know how to build a coaster, and similar controls to what was in RCT3 would be helpful for elevating track pieces and turning etc. Also, the ability to morph the width of entrances would be great to meet the different sizes of paths.  If you haven't yet, pick this game up.",

Although the game does have a big management aspect to it, it could be argued that previous games of its kind focused more on challenging management scenarios. Whereas Planet Coaster seems to be more aimed at the creative and casual crowd.   Still, Planet Coaster is best in class as far as these kind of games go.

Frontier the people who made Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 licensed under Atari. Frontier was backstabbed by Atari, so in retaliation Frontier made Planet Coaster.   Now to the actual review: If you played any of the Roller Coaster Tycoon games in the past you'll feel right at home. Especially if your a fan of Roller Coaster Tycoon 3. This game takes the qualities that made RCT3 great and perfects them and adds more. Unlike the sad excuse for a game called Roller Coaster Tycoon World this game allows you to let your creativity flow and allows an extremely in depth tycoon game to flourish. Even if you aren't creative there are options for you like the pre-built structures implemented by the developers or from amazing creative people from the strong community, when I say strong I mean like Soviet Russia strong. The community is full of amazing people always willing to help you, dedicated to replicating real life parks or their own interpretations of their dream parks. Graphics are astonishing and are some of the best, although I would've liked it for the developers to allow Sli and Crossfire compatability. My only major gripe with the game is not being able to create custom timed firework displays, I mean custom mp3 files options are in the game why not finish it off? Other than that this game embodies my childhood and brings it up to todays gaming standards which not only makes me happy but makes Mother Russia happy as well. Buy this game, don't buy RCTW because just like Beats by Dre and Apple you're only buying the product for the brand not the quality.",

I rebought Rollercoaster Tycoon 2 years later and never really dipped into it either, not that I didn't have a great amount of respect for the game or the fact it's an icon for the genre as a whole, it's stimply a game that I just didn't gel with it.  Then. Came Planet Coaster and I have been hooked ever since I got the early pre-alpha a few months back. I've seen update and the development process of this game and watched every livestream that Frontier have done for this game, and seen how the devs have put their soul into this game and how they talked about each new intergration that was happening in the game as it developed and how they were open to listen tp the community to add or improve on features within the game, time and time again I have seen a devloper who knows what they're doing becuase they've been and done a game like this before having worked on Thrillville, Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 and the expansion packs for Rollercoaster Tycoon 2.   They have the experience and taken their time to devlop Planet Coaster, a creative theme park sim and managment game for the modern day and they have nailed it damn right on the head at every turn.

The scenery and building systems are very solid and with the ability to use fine movement controls you can really customise the overall look and feel of your park. The scenery does lack somewhat and hopefully they will add more in the future, but what is there is very well done and nicely detailed.  Planet Coaster however lacks somewhat in the management department, with only a few mechanics to work out before your park is running smoothly. It also somewhat fails to disclose how some of the game's movement and placement mechanics work, but once you've worked them out they work very well. The game also has a problem with performance, which is probably to be expected with a game that simulates thousands of NPCs, you may find yourself lowering the graphical settings to ensure a smooth framerate, however my suggestion is to pause the in-game time when building as the framerate will usually smooth itself out. Overall Planet Coaster is a fantastic game for those of us who want to create beautiful, exciting and in-depth rollercoaster parks.",

The game works flawlessly for me on high settings, I haven't tried ultra, but I don't really need to as high looks absolutely amazing.   The soundtrack is amazing. They must have worked dilligently with psychologists and music therapists to capture music that actually inspires you and makes you feel creative and nostolgic all at once. Which is why I am glad for the Thrillseeker edition because I will find myself wanting to listen to it even when I'm not playing the game.  The graphics, quality, and dedication to this game are so evident. From how the team was on their Facebook page and livestreams to the posts they write. It's so obvious how much love went into this. Unlike their competitor who is clearly more worried about money for an unfinished game. Frontier really set the bar on what it means to be a top notch community manager with Bo. Congrats, because that made me want to buy the game even more.   One thing is I don't know how to build a coaster, and similar controls to what was in RCT3 would be helpful for elevating track pieces and turning etc. Also, the ability to morph the width of entrances would be great to meet the different sizes of paths.

            "review_text": "This is based on Sandbox mode in the beta, which the developers have said is nearly feature-complete.  Planet Coaster is a good game, but the more time I spent with it, the more things I noticed were missing from previous games, or even just things that should be that weren't. Missing pieces of scenery sets, fewer rides and shops than RollerCoaster Tycoon, a frustrating pathing system, and entire coaster options of different cars and launch options are missing. The UI is a sore spot as well, giving you tools for micromanagement but nothing to make macromanagement easier.  The rollercoasters are the heart of the game, and though design is intuitive and fun, the rating system is a bit frustrating. Each track piece is assigned an Excitement/Fear/Nausea rating, with fast drops increasing Excitement and Fear, and unbanked turns raising Nausea. They're essentially the Excitement/Intensity/Nausea from RCT. The overall rating of the coaster is based on the overall -average- of each track piece, and it's where problems crop up. Slowing down a fast coaster with brakes to create tension before a drop isn't reflected in game, and you're given a low Excitement rating for having low speed before a drop, dragging your overall rating down. The coaster rating system takes a while to get used to after years of RCT, and the friction feels tuned too high to feel confident in predicting speed - oftentimes I've had to add drive tires to my coaster to keep it going just a few pieces after a lift hill. Heatmaps showing you the most nauseating and most exciting parts of your ride are useful, though a bit limited in application around areas with brakes.  Coaster design is the main draw to Planet Coaster, and it does it well. The designer allows full angle control of each piece horizontally and vertically, along with full control down to the degree a piece is banked at. The familiar chain lift speed, block brake, and loop-de-loops are there, along with Norwegian loops, bowtie loops, banana rolls, and just about everything that comes up under 'Rollercoaster Elements' on Wikipedia. There's 28 base rollercoasters, including floorless, launch, seated, inverted, standup, giga, and wooden coasters. Unfortunately, Boomerang/Shuttleloop-type coasters are missing, and car-type is decided by coaster rather than having multiple options. Friction is, again, tuned a bit high, forcing you to make larger and bigger-scale coasters compared to RCT. Overall, the designer is intuitive and easy to grasp, and the angle-snap button allows you to move pieces in precise increments of 15 degrees to make it even easier.  Staff and park management is frustrating, with plenty of micromanagement options right down to how much of a condiment you want on a shop's burgers, but little room for macromanagement. Individual staff members can be trained and given raises down to the dollar, but there's no way to simply train your staff to a higher level whenever they're ready and give them an appropriate raise automatically, or even train more than one employee at a time. Syncing shop prices and condiments across a park is bizzarely missing from Frontier's previous RCT3, forcing you to go through however many burger or drink stands you have to make sure they're the same price, same toppings, same settings on each. Hiring staff is a sluggish process of hitting the park management window, waiting a few seconds, hiring and placing staff, then repeating this process beceause the management screen closes after hiring. If your staff aren't given the proper wages, they'll also have a mood debuff, and might even quit on you, wasting their training.  The game is strongest in coaster building and scenery. There's hundreds of scenery pieces with a wide array of animatronics and props from fairytale dragons to dying aliens, from castle walls to metal alloy roofs. These pieces can be combined in nearly limitless ways, though most walls and roofs can't be rotated freely. Thankfully, light fixtures, doors, windows, and most non-building scenery options -can- be rotated freely through 3-axes. Though some pieces of certain scenery sets are missing, it's easy enough to take advantage of the no-clip scenery and simply fake what you can by throwing together a few smaller pieces (NOTE: This may have been fixed in launch, I didn't check every piece yet). Once you've finished, you can save a building as a blueprint, scenery and all, and share it to the Steam Workshop. For those not creatively inclined, this means you can just search for what you want and download it and place it or modify it within seconds in-game.  Terrain sculpting is another high point. Pulling, pushing, roughening, and smoothing terrain is simple, though sheer cliff faces are near-impossible. Checkboxes for whether the terrain should respect scenery and form around it, or just ignore it, means sculpting a tunnel around a pre-built coaster or making an underground ride is easy.  Flat ride selection suffers outside of coasters, especially in theming. If you want a scifi version of some rides like swinging ships, you're out of luck. If you want bumper cars? Nope. Elevators and chairlifts? Sorry, main transport is monorails. There's classics like merry-go-rounds, gyro swings, and ferris wheels, but it lacks in the smaller rides like hedge mazes and haunted houses. There's not a lot of room for small, 'local' parks in Planet Coaster. Everything is big, up-to-date with electronics and flashing lights. It can feel a bit too pristine. Water ride selection similarily suffers, though the log flume and river rapids covers the fan favorites.  Overall, Planet Coaster is a pretty good sandbox game, maybe even a great one. Many of the annoyances with management fade away with unlimited money, and there's never been anything better when it comes to scenery and coaster design, especially with the blueprint sharing system. The detail and polish to what rides are there and the coasters are fantastic, and the personality to the game is just as bubbly as a theme park game should be. Where the game suffers most is in the actual management system and in ride selection. Though difficult to live up to RCT1/2/3, the UI feels sluggish when it comes to staff and park management, and the tedious process of staff wages and training seems so obviously unoptimized it makes you wonder if it's intentional. It's not unplayable by any means, but it does put a damper on what should be a better experience. However, a big advantage Planet Coaster has is developers that clearly care about the game and are willing to update and keep optimizing the game to be better, and even what's now slightly tedious has come a long way from Alpha and Beta.",

Now, after my first hour with Planet Coaster, I am experiencing ALL those sensations! In other words, what Frontier have here with Planet Coaster is they have brought Walt Disney World into my home!!  I am FLOORED by the quality of this game!! From the second it loaded I knew I was looking at something special. And as I played the past two hours I was just totally absorbed into the games atmosphere. From the sounds, to the visuals, to the slow transition in lighting as the sun set, to seeing the joy on the guests faces, their reactions, etc. To sitting on the Cups ride and seeing a family come in with me and they reacting with joy as we spun around... Oh my God...!! I swear to you right now, I feel like I have just spent an hour in Walt Disney World!!  THANK YOU, Frontier, so much for putting so much detail into this truly astounding, immersive, creative, themepark building game.

However, as someone who always lost past park managment games in the past, this is a good stepping stone for those who aren't very good at the management aspect and can't figure out what they're doing is wrong. There could still be improvments; if a guest complains about trash you'll won't know where the trash is at and will have to skim through your park looking for it. If you want to train or raise worker's wages you'll have to do so individually as the menu that shows you your workers only takes you to where they are in the park and pulls up their menu so you can mess with their schedule/payments/etc. It would be wonderful if they added the find tool to complaints about trash/puke and gave the staff menu the ability to mess with wages, training, and schedules.  It'd also be nice to have side games, like those in carnivals and fairs, as an option as well since I always see those in theme parks.  Aside from that and the lacking number of shops and flat rides, this game is amazing, gorgeous, and great fun. Even if you aren't the most creative person you can use the presets to make a legitimate looking park.

The answer is: It totally will be in a year, and hopefully we won't have to pay more for it.  In short, the core game is here, and fantastic. It is absolutely the true successor to the rollercoaster tycoon series. The bad news is it's got 20% of the content it should, and is the very clear product of a community of alpha testers who were primarily interested in their favorite pet coaster and elaborate, hyper-detailed scenery and building options.  But the game doesn't even have as many rides in TOTAL as RCT3 shipped with in each CATEGORY of ride. There are a fair number of coasters but several of them are just duplicates of one another with minor variants, and there still aren't as many as shipped with previous tycoon games.  The management is even more rudimentary than RCT3 and offers precisely zero innovations, the career campaign is as identically bland and forgettable as old games, and in many cases the interface is actually a step back, although they're tweaking it bit by bit. Oh, and that revolutionary 'guest brain' they spent so much time hyping in marketing? You'll just have to take their word for it that it's under there, somewhere. Because parks operate, and guests react, identically to the way they did in RCT3. There are absolutely no visible signs of this 'simulation evolved' nonsense they kept going on about. It's RCT3 with better graphics and less functionality right now, straight up.  The game shouldn't have gone full release yet, it deserved and required another 6 months of development dedicated solely to expanding features and content. But the devs have promised heavy post-release support before pursuing paid DLCs, so we can hope that in a year's time they'll have actually completed the game and we can finally enjoy the next rollercoaster tycoon in all its glory.  The degree to which you want to be upset about this shortcoming is up to you. I'm fine with it, but only on the promise that they'll actually complete the game now that they've sold it to me.  But don't believe the fanboys raving about how it's already perfect. They're so dedicated to supporting the game that they're willing to lie to themselves and tell each other stories about 'omg how hard it is to make a game in 2016 compared to 20 years ago we should be so grateful we have what we do,' which is patent ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. The devs built a very solid core game then skipped the second half of development in favor of releasing it to the paying market, and it shows. But it's likely to only change for the better as time goes on. I fully expect to be updating this review to an unconditional 'recommend' within 12 months.",

After the first 5 minutes, you basically have unlimited money for the rest of the game.

It's 100% about the sandbox building experience.

The TL:DR: The game is stunningly beautiful, but was probably released a month too early and as such will have a few, near-game breaking bugs. If they don't add more of a challenge to the game in the future, and if you are not into games where you purely design, you will most likely get bored fast of this game.   1. The game is basically a theme park designer. There is no real challenge even on the hardest difficulties. The difficulty feels gauged to a 5 year old, and I have yet to see any failure conditions. In campaign, it feels more like a long tutorial than a game, I finished 7 maps in the campaign in 2 1/2 hours by sloppily throwing in the buidlings it needed, since there were no reprecussions to bad actions.   2. The base game feels like they got lazy and tossed in steam workshop to allow people to finish it for them, there is only default structures for 1/4th of the available shops, the rest you have to get from workshop or design yourself.   3. There are quite a few bugs and unfinished features, such as sudden spikes in money (go from 2000 to 50000 ), having coasters suddenly stop and not load passengers, even though they are not broken down, or the inability to name monorail stations individually which makes it hard to work on them. There is also features that feel like they were going somewhere with them but then stopped, like being able to select your headquaters on the planet, yet there is no purpose for this, or seeing how much your park is worth, yet you can not sell your park.  4. Game Crashes, which can be frustrating when you are into making extremely detailed parks only to suddenly lose the last 30 minutes of work.

This made it necessary to make difficult compromises and the quality of the games was not as good as it could have been.The money the company earned from these contracts was invested into the Planet Coaster project, which was intended from the start to avoid all such compromises and go 'all out' to mak.  Secondly, the game is intended to be around for a while and technology is going to progress further. What is cutting edge today will soon be the midrange. The graphics cards in the recommended specification are already being replaced by faster models by manufacturers.  Finally, as you point out, the competition has positioned itself to serve the segment of the market that uses lower spec computers. As a result, our position in the higher specification market works out fairly well. This way there is a game for everyone.' - Ride Inspector Vega Planet Coaster Customer Support  Yes the graphics look amazing but not everyone can afford a gaming PC. The one thing I have always loved about RCT3 was that you could play it regardless of what end system you had.  To run Planet Coaster well, designers have pitched this at the high end market, knocking out 95% of people that own a computer.  Come on guys. Who says that gaming is an Elite club where membership is high? Planet Coaster do.",

I'm a Rollercoaster Tycoon veteran, so seeing some youtubers play this, and enjoying the RCT series, I thought I would like this. It does have some pros, but for me the cons outweigh the pros.  Pros:  -Very beauiful graphics -Curved paths  Cons: -Lack of basic ride options to make a proper themed park, such as you would find in RCT3 -I smell a money grab. If items aren't given in updates, you may very well have to pay for numerous expansions and packs just to add more, better content to the game. I'm not ready to have to spend that much on this game.   I wish it had more content, that would definitely make it better for me, allow me to be more creative with it.",

The game keeps crashing on me every. the most I have been able to do is place 1 thrill ride and somew stores and after about 3 - 4 mins playtime it just crashes. Roller coaster tycoon world has never crashed on me once and I have the graphics right up. I thought this game was alot less buggy and smooth than that game acording to the community. Don't know what they are complaining about now with roller coaster world? Never had so many issues re crashing on a game on my computer. Hopefully can play once bugs are fixed. ",

Here's hoping you have better luck than I did if you buy this.   ---Original Review---  Of the 1,500 user reviews for this game less than 50 are negative. That should tell you something right there. It really is quite something, this is to RollerCoaster Tycoon what Cities Skylines is to Sim City.  I'm giving it a negative review because of the performance issues the game is having. Given the overwhelmingly positive reception Planet Coaster is receiving you may not notice just how many people are having performance issues. Check the Steam discussions and you will see people with i7s, 32gb ram, and gtx 1070s being unable to achieve a stable 30fps ON AN EMPTY PARK. Meanwhile you will also see people getting stable fps over 40 with i5s, 8gb ram, and gtx 970s on loaded parks with over a thousand guests. Personally, I can't even run the game at 1920x1080 on lowest settings and get much more than a semi-stable 20fps. This is an improvement though; just yesterday in the beta I was barely getting 15fps.  I have faith that Planet Coaster will receive some more optimizations. When that day comes I will definitely update this review. Until then, buyer beware. It's really hit or miss that you'll be able to run this game.",

            "review_text": "There are some games that leave you with such a favourable first impression that you're happy to neglect their flaws and enjoy them for what they are. This is not one of those games. I've not played a Coaster Tycoon game in at least ten years and I was hoping to have a reasonable re-introduction from the genre via a decent tutorial. First I had to change the interface size from 'Unreadably Tiny' to 'Readably Tiny' via 'Large enough to read but too big to scale correctly to the screen size'. This was frustrating and unnecessary. The UI isn't awful but having to scale something that should autoscale correctly to a size that is suitable for use without a pair of binoculars is not on.   The main menu presented three tutorial videos. None of which were especially informative (fifteen minutes of total content with about six minutes of actual information). Suitably armed with sod all I figured that the first campaign mission would be a tutorial type mission. Surely there would be some nice text to guide me through setting up my first park? I mean, I'd struggle to read it but at least I'd have a starting point. But no, I was dumped into a small, functional park with about as much idea of how to proceed as the plastic pirate propping up the rollercoaster. I worked out how to drop a toilet block down (the game didn't tell me to do this, it just reflected my mindset at the time) and stared at it for a bit. Welcome to commode world, try our many varieties of crapper.   'A-ha,' I thought in my lavatorial fugue, 'this must be an older school game than I gave it credit for. Maybe there's a whacking great 400 page manual like Falcon 4.0 had that I can spend a couple of days devouring before I play. A quick check of the steam page did not reveal anything, so I consulted papa google. Top hit is a forum post from March that tells me that the Alpha is starting. We are saved. I resorted to asking on the Reddit discord page for PC and got directed to a Youtube video where a member of the game community tells me about angle snapping and how to insert myself into the head of a customer while being interrupted every four minutes by Audi adverts.   I can imagine there's a solid simulation game under here somewhere. I can maybe stretch to there being some interesting management underpinning the sad, grey lavatory block I dropped from the sky next to the octopus ride. But for the life of me I can't figure it out. The game has no desire to teach me how to play it, and I resent having to go trawling Youtube for a video that teaches me the basics of the interface. Even Crusader Kings II tried to explain what all the buttons do, even if it failed badly to explain just about anything else. A new player experience this poor is just too big a stumbling block for me. It leaves a horrible impression and makes me think that the developers were too caught up making minute adjustments to track camber to remember that they're making a game. Can't recommend in the current state.",

I made the mistake of forgetting to check for 3rd party DRM and am requesting a refund on my purchase. Don't make the mistake of putting this junk on your system. Gameplay doesn't matter when it comes to any form of extra DRM. I don't support it and I strongly do not recommend this game to anybody for that reason.  Edit:  I need to add something here apparently for those of you who don't know. If you change your operating system or your hardware in your computer this DRM works by making you prove that you have the right to use this software. Now, if you don't have internet access for some reason this means that you wont be playing this game until you do. So, why am I trolling on this game with this DRM? Because if you have spotty internet access, live in the country, live at sea, travel a lot, upgrade your computer often, or are like me then you probably wont be too happy about what this DRM does and means for consumers then you probably will be stung by it later. Seriously, research what this DRM is before condeming me a troll. I find this DRM to be just as bad as any DRM that can get between a user and the software they paid for and I will absolutely fight for consumer rights to not have a disadvantaged experience in the pursuit of stopping pirates. If fighting pirates makes for a bad experience for even one customer then that fight has been too expensive.",
