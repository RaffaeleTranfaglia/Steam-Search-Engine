            "review_text": "Upon hearing about this game's port to Steam on Wayforward's website, I was ecstatic. Checking the Steam store everyday in hopes to see it. And the day has finally arrived! I'm a fan of Wayforward's Shantae serious so I was eager to jump into their other games.   Story  In Mighty Switch force, you play as the aptly named Patricia Wagon after what appears to be a prison transport vehicle crashes and releases all of these blonde female prisoners in short shorts, miniskirts, and low cut dresses. And taken from both the background and the stages itself, the game appears to take place in a dystopian like universe or more like the Chemical Plant zone from Sonic 2   Gameplay  The game is in short, is a puzzle platformer. As you progress through levels, you use Patricia's ability to alter reality, bringing blocks and other items in existance and taking others out. All the while, capturing the escaped prisoners and taking out the occasional baddie with your laser pistol. You aren't actually given a tutorial and your just thrown right into the game after starting the first level and getting a quick cutscene that stages the story. Patricia can only take three hits, so if those three hearts get depleted, it's back to the stage selection screen for you. Fortunately, you can restore her health by eating...floppy discs? She says yum so she must be eating them for whatever reason.    Levels  All the levels are rather unique, introducing a new mtheod to solving puzzles with each stage, along with an amazing soundtrack that are unique to each individual stage. And each stage having a bit of replayability due to their being a par time to see how fast you can complete it. And after playing a few levels, it seems rather difficult to accomplish, at least from my perspective.   Artstyle  I felt like I needed to mention this. I can't get over Wayforward's artstyle and feeling the need to praise it whenever given the chance. It's phenomenal.   Negatives  There are a few bad things to say about this title, as I mentioned before there's no tutorial. Whether you see this as a good thing or a bad thing, it's entirely opinion. But I honestly prefer some sort of introduction to Patricia's ability to bend reality. Granted there are few controls so not much to get upset over. And there really isn't much of a story which I think is rather unfortunate considering that their Shantae series is brimming with life and a story with witty dialogue that's sure to be remembered. While the only dialogue you'll be getting here is 'Justice is Served' or 'Checkpoint'!    Verdict  It's a honestly a rather fun enjoyable game that's easy to jump right into. And for the price of ten dollars, it's not bad especially if your a Wayforward fan",

            "review_text": "A fun puzzle/platformer with nice aesthetics and music. MSF has 16 regular and 5 bonus stages, plus unlockable remixed versions of levels after you clear all the regular and bonus stages. Game handles well and the controls are simple. You can jump, shoot, switch and that's it. You're always at max speed so there's no need to hold a button to run, which is always a plus. Art is nice and clean and the soundtrack by Jake Kaufman is up-tempo and catchy.  Gameplay-wise, there's no fat. No cut-scenes, no dialogue, no tutorials. It feels very acadey in this sense, as most levels are designed to be beaten in a couple of minutes and are fairly compact. There are a few variations to block-switching, but nothing too hard to grasp outside of initially figuring out how red/blue lock blocks work. I hate red/blue lock blocks.   Each level's goal is to solve puzzles to find the five hooligan sisters scattered about. You're not likely to find yourself annoyed at finding a missing sister since the game has a handy 'pointer' system that directs you in the location of the nearest sister. It's a simple thing but it helps keep the pace up.  The only two negatives I can see for this game are length and the last level. Clearing the 16 normal and 5 bonus stages probably won't take more than 3-4 hours for most people. The replayability comes from trying to 'low-score'/speedrun the levels in the fastest amount of time. If you're into that, you just added a lot of extra gameplay. You also unlock a sort of easy mode gun by beating the game that lets you play through a number of levels in a different manner.    I'm much more about quality of gameplay over quantity, so I'd definitely rather play a 3-5 hour game that's really fun like MSF than a 12-25 hour game that's kind of okay. If you have a 'I need x amount of gameplay for every dollar spent' mentality, you'll probably find yourself cringing at the idea of paying 10 bucks for a short game like MSF, but if you don't think like that, you'll probably be happy with a full price purchase if you like puzzle/platformers.  Onto to the second negative, the last level of both the regular stages and bonus stages are pretty bad and do the terrible video game thing of taking the primary gameplay mechanic of a game and flipping it out its head. Throughout the game, you have complete control of block switching and playing mostly compact, short stages. For whatever reason, WayForward thought it was good idea to make the finales really long and with an automated switch mechanic. There's also much more a focus on fast-twitch platforming and I could see people who are more interested in the puzzle part of puzzle/platformer giving up in frustration. It also doesn't help that MSF has an archaic life system that really rears its head during the finales. It's very annoying to get near the end of the level only to suffer a cheap death, and there are truly cheap deaths near the end of the finales, and have to start over from the beginning. Then again, WayForward had a dumb life system in DuckTales, too.  In short, + a fun, nice-looking puzzle/platformer with a good soundtrack and replayability if you're into speedrunning levels. - the last levels of both the regular and bonus modes are difficult in way the rest of the game isn't, and a short overall play time if you just one-and-done each level.",

            "review_text": "Excellent game with a really great soundtrack (As expected from Jake Kaufman) and nice and colorful HD graphics. It's mostly a platforming game although it quickly goes into puzzle territory thanks to its mechanics.  The story is more of an excuse-plot so you're not going to find a deep storyline here, not like it's really needed though as the gameplay is quite engaging. Basically you're a cop named Patricia Wagon and your objective through 95% of the game is to capture 5 different sexy prisoners scattered across the stage. To do that you have a pellet gun (That is mostly used to break some blocks or detonate bombs) and the ability to switch 'dimensions' which causes transparent blocks to become tangible and viceversa. The switching is what helps you move through most of the stages and solve puzzles.  Controls are quite simple, one button to jump, one to shoot, one to switch dimensions and one extra button you can hold to move the camera and scout the nearby area before moving on. Physics are great and the game is pretty fair when it comes to level design so whenever you lose is mostly your fault although be prepared for the latter stages as you'll need quick reflexes to get through many of the puzzles. Note that unlike most platformers holding or pressing the jump button has no difference, you'll still jump the same height.  The game has a total of 16 initial stages and upon finishing them you'll then have to go through 5 more bonus stages. If you finish those then another whole batch of 16 stages + 5 bonus stages will become available. Thers are FAR harder versions of the previous batch with remixed music, colors.  The game looks quite short at first but if you're willing to go towards 100% completion then you can sink 10 hours into it with ease as each stage has a PAR time to beat and beating them all requires you to master the mechanics of the game. In fact, playing the game just to beat it and not caring about the PAR times greatly reduces the overall experience.  Worth mentioning again: The soundtrack is AMAZING.",

At first the puzzles can be alittle confusing but it does not take much effort to solve them. the game has a switch mode where you have to switch some blocks in order to progress which they use pretty good, they could have elaborated that more because right now the game feels kind of rushed, especially considering how short it is. As a big fan of platforming games this was for me a dissapointment. It is pretty cheap but I would still wait until it goes on sale.",

            "review_text": "I love this game! It's like all of the fast-paced Metroid elements but without the grand story and it's more episodic. It's a game built for speedrunning. If you enjoy constantly trying to be faster and faster at a game and trying to find better paths for better time and such, this game is for you. Also if you like a fun side-scrolling shooter platformer that's easy to get into with beautiful art that doesn't take itself too seriously, you'll love this.  Also, don't even get me started on the soundtrack. It's all wonderful electro-housey stuff that is candy for the ears. Jake Kaufman's official Mighty Switch Force soundtrack can be bought at a price you name (literally as low as $.01 if you want) on his Band Camp profile. I have the soundtrack actually on my phone and play some of the tracks now and then on the way to and from work. If you're a fan of electronic music, I definitely recommend picking the soundtrack up because all of the tracks in the game's stages are actually full-length songs that are beautifully produced.",
