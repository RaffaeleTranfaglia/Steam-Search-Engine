Be warned that this is not a FPS game and you spend a good portion exploring the world and unlocking story elements. The game play is streamlined and easy to pick up. The graphics are good and what you expect from this price point. A fun and short game that is worth picking up and spending a weekend with.",

            "review_text": "Final thoughts: intriguing! As per the trailer, there's commentary on family life in the context of this very distant line of work. Without getting into specific spoilers, there's a pretty solid analogy being made in this narrative that hit home with me. It's not subtle, which is... perhaps just the roughness of a quick indie-type dev cycle (even if this isn't really an indie title). That doesn't bother me much. It lacks polish, but the core of the thing works.   It's surreal narrative arc with a cycle of progression not unlike Groundhog's Day (the movie), a floating drone assistant that goes through several personality shifts. And it drops existentialist bombs on the regular. The game tells you from the beginning that you will succeed, that your mission is nearly complete, and that you will be reward upon your return home. As one might guess from the cover art, all does not go well.  Also, I'm pretty sure I'm smack dab in the middle of the target audience for this narrative. There are a bunch of details in there that describe things in my life almost eerily accurately, so that's fascinating. The whole tone of the thing is weird and sad, and at the end I felt weird and sad, even though it didn't explicitly tell me to feel that way, so I think the design is working.  It's rough experiment, through and through, but I was compelled to finish. It leaves me wanting to see a new game about this organization and to be able to do more hands-on science in this universe. Also- the LAVA planet is awesome. Just sayin'.",

            "review_text": "Short.  Quickly uninteresting.  Repetitive.  I got this game not knowing anything anything about it. I was really excited for the first 15 minutes when I saw the impressive graphics of the living quarters. Then less and less excitement until I completed the game in about 3 hours feeling like I wasted time and money. I am fond of short games like Dear Ester, or To the Moon as long as they are thoughtful, rich and interesting. Corpse of Discovery isn't anything like that, however.   The dialog is very contrived, cliche, and forced, nearly to the point of being irritating. Whoever wrote the dialog in this game I am pretty sure knew this because the game even teases you about its own repetitiveness. It almost feels like the game has gotten bored of itself.  The gameplay mechanics consist of running and long jumping to points on the display. There are some floaty wrath creature things that do nothing but interfere with the running to the objective. On one level there is a radiation that drains your radiation bar if you're exposed in the sun too long.  I'm going to end this review half ♥♥♥♥♥ and lazy just like this game's ending. Take the few hours and watch a movie like Interstellar, Solaris, or Sunshine instead of bothering with this game.",

            "review_text": "This is an interesting walking sim with some platforming elements. The game intially grabs the player quite well thanks to its Groundhog's Day/All You Need is Kill vibe that it starts out with, and its rather depressing narrative keeps the player at least somewhat interested as to what exactly is going on with the player character.   Sadly the game lacks innovation in its own mechanics, and the narrative, although interesting, isn't really directly present until the last two sections of the game. During the time between the initial grab at the player attention and the entertaining, albeit sad conclusion, there is very little keeping the player going outside of the hope for answers. The world building present throughout the game is kept rather minimal, whether this was to keep the narrative as the focus and allow for theorizing, or just lazy game design is up to the player to decide.   All in all I'd have to say that the game is interesting enough for me to validate a $5 purchase (the price which I originally bought the game at), but it's best to keep in mind that there is next to no replayability unless you are some kind of theorist fanatic or have a friend sit down and play it while you look for their thoughts and reactions.  TL;DR The game is worth a $5 purchase for those looking for a short (approximately 3 hour) walking sim with an interesting, albeit depressing narrative, and aren't looking for games with replayability in mind.  I give it a weird black creature/an entertaining AI Dialogue.",

            "review_text": "Corpse of Discovery is a fascinating and heartbreaking story. It is fairly graphics-intensive at times, although reducing the video settings did increase my framerate. I would recommend this game especially to anyone who enjoys movies like Moon, Interstellar, and Europa Report. Don't play this game looking for an experience like Dead Space - it isn't a survival horror game. Your biggest obstacles will be navigating the often treacherous terrain of an alien world named Tellarus. The voice acting is extremely well-done and the EVA companion has an ego akin to GLaDOS - she is both hilarious and frustrating at different times and in equal measure.",

This title had some serious potential – what doesn’t sound intriguing about surviving on and exploring alien planets due to a corporate space exploration bungle, piecing together the mystery as to what happened and how to return to Earth along the way? Instead, Corpse of Discovery plays like an interactive novella that examines the subjects of family, duty, personal sacrifice and isolation, but falls short on delivering any true sense of survival or danger.

It's worth the price and time to play. Took me about 3 hours, more if you hunt for the extra bits.   The game has a way of digging under your skin and making you just want to get to the end but it's a part of the story. I felt like it was a really good book, with it's ups and downs, it's foreshadowing and the climax with a nice resolution.  Also, it's mostly 3D platforming. So, if you don't like that, I wouldn't suggest it.",
