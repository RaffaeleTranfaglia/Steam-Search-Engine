Countries need to ensure that their space exploration board has the proper funding to enforce all important safety constraints and prevent such incidents happening in the future. I only hope that the politicians and those in charge of space program budgets take heed of such events.",

I mostly recommend buying this game if you played it when you were younger and want to have a nostalgia trip or if you are a parent with a young kid. These games taught me how to use a computer and were the first games I ever played so they'll always be close to my heart. ",
