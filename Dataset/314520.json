This game does focus on a European style of Fishing, this is bait fishing! Personally I think it's far more tactical then lore or fly fishing.  Overall, this is a great start and I'm excited to see how the game develops from here!",

Its on very early stage and by helping us funding them we (in the future) will have the complete game. anyway ... Seeing the developer in touch, this somehow makes me want to give them a vote of confidence. GL.",

I use an XBOX controller and I'd love to see a vibration mode in a future update. Overall it's good but it does require a powerful system to run it with high quality setting. I had to drop the resolution to 1280×720 to make it more playable with medium quality which makes for more successful casting",

Its supposed to be challenging and just one of those things that you have to master before you throw a perfect cast every time. I even found reeling in the fish was a nice challenge also (for me) but others may not think its hard and just pick it up fast. The only thing I have seen in the negative reviews that I agreed with is the textures and water quality but im running the game on ultra so it didnt bother me. The other presets though are kinda ugly but not ugly enough to give the game a negative review. I am a carp fisherman in real life and this game represents that well. The game is very fun and addicting but definantly not worth 25 bucks with the amount of content but if you get this on sale right now its worth it. If you are a fisherman this game is a must have. Hope this review helps people that cant decide whether or not to buy",

I will not support a company that treats it's customer base like dog waste and this represents a company that only wants the peoples money and when it have it, push their nose in a pile of sand! I'm want my money back I have shut down two monitors and with it running on the one monitor it locks up! I try to run this for 62 minutes.",

Everytime ive had a good fish on game just falls on it face not cool. Graphics are pretty nice and the methods are spot on. This game's biggest problem though with the bugs its just not worth the cash and you have fishing planet which is free but a bit of a grind its also more geared towards novice anglers.

            "review_text": "Fishing. I love it all my life. It was the only thing my Father and I did together as I grew up. My dad was a student of fishing. By that I mean, he tied flies, he read, etc. I started fishing in England. Catching Roach, and other river, stream, fish.  This game doesn't remind me much of my fishing experiences through life. I live on the shores of Georgian Bay, Ontario. Muskoka region, and all around there are a huge divesity of fish here in Wasaga Beach. Sturgeon in the Nottawasaga, rainbow trout runs up the river from Bay. Salmon, carp, catfish, brook trout, brown trout.  What I'm saying is a title with 'simulation' in it, should at least try to be realistic.  Its a sterile, boring, bland, and not realistic to my fishing days. I'm not saying the 'type' of fishing is what I don't like, its the game play, that's way off.   I wasn't hoping for much more, but this is taking bare bones a bit too far. If this is the only type of fishing you Europeans can do, save up and come to Canada. You will then feell like you've really fished. And see again how far off this 'Simulation' is.  Graphics ...bland, weak colours, water is from circa 2005. No underwater shots, to see the fish use its particular abilities to throw the hook and run with the bail screaming on your reel. The sense of weight, the feel like you are working something toward you, careful guiding it around obstacles , lowering rod tip when you think the Fish is about to jump.  Basic stuff . But not even that. All you have to do, is basically Horse the fish in. No light tackle option to really use skill in playing a fish in  I can't recommend this game to anyone, Its just a shell of a game. 5 perch out of 10. There are no fish in school in this game, they're all drop outs.",

I don't like style what this game shows 'just give some fishfood and catch a fish'. It almost like throw dynamite and collect results. It is morally wrong when we talk real hunting/fishing.  I know this is just a game but hope simulation tag will removed from this game. Simulation should base real life and good hunting recommendations.  ",
