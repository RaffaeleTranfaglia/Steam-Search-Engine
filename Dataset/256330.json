            "review_text": "Rally is my favorite form of racing/competition and gotta say I'm very surprised how good WRC4 actually is, I played WRC3 and didnt like it much, but this is a huge improvement. The driving feel is awesome, the cars react how they should. The stages are simply amazing, they can be difficult and tight but that's what I love of rally racing. Multiplayer is great fun, I can only hope it keeps a good healthy community.  Comparing this to Codemasters rally titles:  Handling: WRC 4 Stages: WRC 4 Sound: DiRT 2/3 Graphics: DiRT 2/3  Codemasters take the sound and graphics department by far but gameplay is definitely better in WRC 4. I'm happy the official WRC titles made it to steam, totally worth the day 1 purchase.",

            "review_text": "I feel somewhat torn about this game. On the one hand it is a competent rally game we had not since Colin McRae Rally 2005 and Richard Burns Rally. On the other hand it has some serious flaws. The game has quite arcady driving physics, and if it is good or not for you, it depends on your personal preferences. This is a proper rally game, so it does not have any Ghymkhana, rallycross or baja nonsense. It contains 4 classes (WRC, WRC 2, WRC 3 and Junior WRC) and 13 rallies with 6 special stages each.  On the other hand the amount of roads is quite limited. Each rally has 6 stages, but there are driven mostly through the same pieces of road, so there are only about 2 unique special stages per rally. The fact that kept us playing old rally games was great amount of special stages and vehicles, there just is not enough of that. The game is capped to 30 frames per second, what is unacceptable for a PC driving game nowadays, but there are some methods to remove this cap. The game still has some bugs, which are not game braking, but still can be annoying for some people.  The bottom line is that if you are into rally games, get it on sale. It has too much flaws to be recommended at full price, but if you can get it cheaper, it is worth playing. ",

I've played WRC2 on X360 and found the graphics really enjoyable (in despite of most critics), but for some reason, the overall graphic quality for WRC4 has dropped substantially. Why? I've played DiRT 1/2/3/SD and, indeed, Codemasters' graphics rule, but their increasingly efforts to bring DiRT closer to the X-Games had me very upset. We lack for a good real rally game with good graphics. But, if I were to choose between graphics and gameplay (as I'm being forced to do), here's my choice.",

Plays a little more realistic than Dirt 2.   I play with an XBox joypad, picked it up for $19.99 in Steam sale. I don't usually buy games unless they're really cheap on sale, but am happy with my purchase.   Now just fix multiplayer please, thank you!",

I'd just come from DiRT 3 wanting longer tracks to keep me playing rather than navigating menu's every 5 minutes. I love DiRT 3 don't get me wrong, it's one of my favourite racing games on the PC. In my opinion it does few things better than this game. Car choice, out of car camera (specifically sense of speed using this camera) and sounds. The reason I didn't enjoy this game to start was the animation of the car seems off. There is no sense of speed when using an out of car camera, this really put me off wanting to play. I decided to push through though and experiment with the different cameras. Cockpit view has saved this game for me. The sense of speed is there and it has immediately become fun to play. The handling feels semi-realistic at most, but is certainly more so than the DiRT titles.  Graphics -4/5 Sound - 4/5 Gameplay - 4.5/5  TL:DR - If you love the out of car camera, then this game may not be for you.",

It was a let down to find their was no TrackIR support, fancy DX11 not so fancy looking at a stand still but strangely looks great at high speed. I would recommend playing in cockpit view, a good headset, 360 pad and adjust the audio levels. All and all id say WRC 4 is great filler for a good price waiting for the next big rally game.",

The quality in the photos on the store page are as high as they would be as you cannot adjust the quality to low or high. This isn't an issue anyway, for me at least.  The gameplay is great. I personally play this game with a pad and the controls are excellent. The cars reacts like it should, in different types of environments and elements.  There is five different levels of AI (1 to 5) such as 1 as really dumb AI to 5 as Pro - Professional. (I'm playing with 2nd level at the moment which seem to be 'normal' difficulty but I kept winning in the first place so it is getting boring however after this season I'm doing is finished, I will increase it to 3).   There is no support for this game if there happen to be an issue but luckily for me, there's no issues for me with my pc SO FAR.  Overall, I'd say 9/10.",

I don't understand the seemingly negative reactions to the game, I would easily recommend WRC 4 to any fan of Rally Racing.  My advice to those seasoned in the Genre would be to disable all driving-assists, set the difficulty to 10 and damage to Heavy.

Despite the mixed reviews its a solid game, esp if u can get a sale. Its prob not quite as good as Dirt 3, but with my gamepad (i don't go all out with a wheel lol) that and GRID (street racing) seem like DRUNK Driving Simulators of just trying to stay straight and not bounce off walls like ping pong with-every tap of direction on the controller sending them flying and hard to not oversteer, despite option adjustments! Its a good mix or realistic (of course can't go full throttle all the time) and playable. Dirt - I can drive a real car way better or at least keep it stright. I like the handling and all the tight turns-rather than just trying to fight to stay straight as I may have mentioned. The graphics are decent, some recycled parts of tracks and would be good to have the option for some more cars to race against, rather than feel like just racing the track. 7/10, hardcore race fans may disagree  Vegan for Animals  Meatvideo.com  - MUST SEE factory-farms",

So no frustration and the fun of experiencing the different tracks and cars. If you liked the DiRT series, this game can actually be easier to win (see above setting), but that it completely up to you. The visuals may be slightly older, but on my five-year-old PC (ATi HD 5850) the game runs at around 60 FPS solid, so no worries there. Definitely get it from the bargain bin if you like rally driving games.",
