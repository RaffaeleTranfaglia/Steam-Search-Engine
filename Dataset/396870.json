The game has its pros and cons but the ingenuity of the puzzles makes up for what it's lacking. The graphics are correct, the foreground/helmet effects look cool. The voice acting is really good. Story is interesting with a lot of background and depth.  I would say, if you love Myst, you'll love this game.  Another good thing is the lack of a walkthrough, making me try harder than usual and far more rewarding :)",
