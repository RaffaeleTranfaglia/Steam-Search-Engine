            "review_text": "Outstandingly realised conversion of an interactive gamebook. It does away with the old cumbersome 'turn to page &lt;whatever&gt; to go left and &lt;whatever&gt; to go right' (unlike the inferior conversions of the Games Workshop titles) with nice use of a direction selecting map. The combat is difficult at first but satisfying as you progress and become used to the many variations on its time-based system. You actually feel as if you are becoming physically and mentally more skillful the more you play. Every stage of the game works on choices and consequences but you never feel as if you are bogged down or distracted by the medium itself. All the dice rolls etc. are handled and masked by the software in such a way that you realise what is going on but the sytem never intrudes on your immersion. It's difficult to imagine how a game of this nature could have been accomplished in a way to make it any better than it actually is. Equipment can be improved through crafting and is customisable in such a way that the new benefits are clearly understood and actively felt. I want more like this and as long as you can keep in mind that it IS a conversion of a set system you should love it. Get it. 97%",

            "review_text": "The game is average, but it has its own uniqueness. Its like an interactive book with multiple tools to get the job done with slight variation to how the game unfolds.  The narative is stylish and done close to how the upcoming 'Hand of Fate' is done, but is somewhat different. Its fancy, rich in details and vivid, making it really easy to picture the events unfolding. Seriously its like an ok fantasy book.  Now the problems with the game are shallow crafting and loot systems, repetitive combat, customisation and soundtrack.   The combat is semi turn based and is somewhat confusing for the 1st 3-6 minutes, then after a few hours of slaying monsters it gets rather repetitve and boring also easy *if you have chosen the perks right* or are willing to use potions.  Crafting system exists but other then the 'inventory increase' the changes the crafted gear brings are minimal. The 'various weapons' are not so various at all its the same 3 weapons with slightly different stats and sometimes a different model. Now the animations are done well *even the comical faces of enemies during the mana restoration finishers* and the gameplay is on the point fluid, but with little variation to it it eventually will get dull no matter what. Too many battles with too little variation.   Soundtrack was distracting and filled with disturbing background noises of a muted phone under a pillow a few meters away.   Overall its a solid game, definite few hours of fun, unless you are impartial to the storytelling narrative, which this game does great.   Overall easy 6-7/10. Worth a puchase when its on sale.",

Recommended, if you don't mind the slow start.  More detailed impressions  here  [xander77.livejournal.com] .",

            "review_text": "Do you like QTEs designed for a different platform, no instructions, indescipherable lockpicking minigames and repetitive combat? Yes? Then you'll love this game. If not, I can't recommend it to you. As a long time Lone Wolf fan, I was eager to see what was on offer. Here's the good, bad and really bad. 1) The Good: The artwork. It's a really lovely looking game ... and that's it. There's not really much of a story so far. The experience is much like reading a graphic novel in an uncomfortable chair that has a bit of wire sticking out and poking your back. 2) The Bad: (i) Not really any instructions. Sometimes, the first time you do something, it will pop-up a tip advising you of a few details but I can't seem to find a way to get those tips back. And there's no instruction manual. (ii) Not really a story so far (to be fair - the books didn't either, usually just along the lines of 'go to the capitol and warn the king'). (iii) Every section is a fight, some sections more than one. You must take the Kai discipline of Healing. Every single action in the game is simple a progression to the next fight. It gets dull, fast. 3) (a) It's all QTEs - and I have no idea what the contact point for half the QTEs are. Some of them seem really easy and almost impossible to fail, while there is another that I have never succeeded in hitting despite being absolutely certain that I did. (b) Sadly most people probably won't read this far but THE LOCKPICKING. It makes me weep. It's really that bad. There is no contact point to tell you when you have hit the sweet spot. The picks break instantly. When they break, your pick is set back to the original position, meaning you have to start from scratch. I had 12 lockpicks. I broke all 12 - on one lock! If you are presented with any other option than using a lockpick, please, for the sake of your sanity, take it! Thank you for reading.",

Choices actually feel like they matter, and the mixture of reading and interacting (mostly for combat) are highly addictive. With ~15h total, it also felt rather nice and long (certainly longer than any visual novel)  10/10. Would save Sommerlund again.",

            "review_text": "The game itself is rather fun, however it seems to me to just give the pretence of 'game defining choices' and nothing you actually do changes the game in any noticible way. The game tries to stretch itself into too many things, and fails to make any one part good, nothing in this game stands out to make it a note worthy game. I know it has a following already due to the books, but if this game was developed without the previous backing of the books it would not have been recieved nearly as well as it has. The graphics are sloppy, the turn based combat isnt bloody turn based as the enemys can attack you while its your turn, the puzzles arent really puzzles as the chance of you completing them in the miniscule time it gives you is next to impossible, and the fact that during a combat sequence you can think you're down to your last enemy, you beat the hard 'boss' and have nearly killed his last minion, when suddenly out of no where another big bad boss walks onto the scene, with 4000 health and calls his buddies along while you have no stamina no health and no kai, leaving the winning of the combat down to trial and error mixed with sheer luck on being able to dodge an attack. I enjoyed the game at some parts, but my overall time spent playing this game left me dissapointed",

The cube puzzle, didn't need the timer. I understand that they want to give you a way to fail it, but without 6 sense, I'm not sure I will be able to go througth them without rage quit. The mouvement of the cube are hard to do, and when you are racing against time its hard to concentrate to find the solution.  Its was one of the first game I played that make me use consumable, for that, good job !.   It took me a while to find the right way to play the game.

The library didn't have the first book, so we had to start with one of the later books. This game works the same way, it's like a direct line to my childhood. It picks up three years after the first sequences of events in the series, with Lone Wolf already having reclaimed the Summerswerd and avenged his fallen brethren.   I was pretty nervous when I saw this game existed. I mean it's honestly bananas that someone else read these and liked them enough to spend money developing a game version. But I didn't need to worry. It's everything I hoped it would be. I thought from the screenshots that they had made it into some slick action game but that's not the case. It's an old school adventure book with a combat system that's more involved than closing your eyes and jabbing your pencil onto a number grid. (Although I would kind of love to see an updated version of that.) The music and sound effects fit perfectly. and the meat of the game is reading.   I love it.",
