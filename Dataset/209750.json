            "review_text": "CF3 is not a bad game, but it's like someone covered a wonderful gourmet meal in tomato ketchup and then tipped it onto a cheap plastic plate.  The originals Cannon Fodder's subtleness, humour, irony, attention to detail, the varying level design, music, the incredible attachment to the survivors you painfully took through 20 levels, and cried when they died. Gone. The thought and love. Gone. All covered in an inch of ketchup. Somewhere under that ketchup you can feel parts of the original meal - but all you can taste ...is the ketchup.    Note: Low hours = I played it long before Steam version came out.",

It is an embarrassment and a tragedy that such an awful game should even be released, let alone one intended to revive one of the greatest RTS series of the 90s.   Spend your money more wisely - grab the original Cannon Fodder on  GOG.com  for $7, then spend the remaining $10 on chocolate milk and cookies.",

I prob should really have played the game before writing this, but im too excited that they released a updated Cannon Fodder!  All we need now, is releases like Moonstone, IK+, Chaos Engine, Xenon etc... Now that would be fantastic.  My recomendation, buy this and give it a shot, its not to pricey and i think we'll all be surprised.",
