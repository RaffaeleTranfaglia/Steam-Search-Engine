I think the game has potential to become very popular if they decide to ever release a map editor/workshop to allow for more user made/or just general content. Kinda like a Trials.

            "review_text": "Ben and Ed, developed by Sluggerfly, is a third-person plat former unlike any other. It’s creative, unique, hilarious, challenging, and most of all, it’s hella fun.  The plot would make for an amazing cartoon on Adult Swim. Basically, the world has gone to ♥♥♥♥, and Ben, a young boy looking for happiness, befriends one of the neighborhood zombies, Ed. But it isn’t long until Hans, a big wig, millionaire and founder of the world’s hottest TV show, Rundead, kidnaps the duo. Ben is held captive, and if Ed wants to reunite with his friend and defeat Hans, he must defy death in the afterlife.  Since Ben and Ed is a plat former, you can expect a serious amount of jumping, running, dodging, throwing, crawling, limping, bleeding, and decapitation. Since you play as a zombie, you can take quite a beating before kicking the bucket. Limbs will be lost, but not your spirit, and this provides players with an extremely entertaining gameplay mechanic. If your legs are snipped clean by an oversized scissor blade, there’s no need to panic! You can adapt by waddling about with your arms and hands. Same goes for the loss of any body part. Instant death is almost always common place in these sorts of games, but Ben and Ed throws in these comical and engaging methods of giving players a second chance. Crawling to the nearest checkpoint with nothing but your head and torso in contact is nerve-racking, to say the least.  Not only that, but there’s a handful of boss fights to keep the action flowing. Speaking of action, it never relents. Each level is more daring and intense than the last, which is no small achievement. You will die… you will die many times, and many times more. But check points are placed at reasonable distances and I never felt cheated or at a disadvantage. Ben and Ed is not an easy game, but it is fair. When you ♥♥♥♥ up, YOU ♥♥♥♥ed up. There’s no one to blame but yourself for an embarrassing demise, and beating that level that had you pinned for over an hour… there’s no better feeling in the world. The motivation to save your best friend and defeat the bad guy in such a unique and original way enhances Ben and Ed’s overall entertainment value, and it really shines.  But gameplay and premise aren’t the only things done right. Graphics are top notch. I felt like I was trapped in some murderous child’s play box. The décor is spine chilling and ripe with pleasantly evil things to admire. Add in an awesome soundtrack and some silky smooth animations, and you’ve got yourself a pretty damn good video game.  This is the first positive review I’ve given on Steam without any negative comments involved. I tried to think of some criticism, I really did… but I can’t. Ben and Ed really is perfect in every sense of the word. With over 20 levels, bonus content, high scores and challenge stages, you really can’t go wrong with this title. It is plat forming done right. It is video games done right. End of story.",

Those screenshots got me really interested and I was excited to play the game myself when it dropped on Steam. I finally got the time and picked it up on sale for $7.99 and actually enjoyed the first couple of levels. Around the first Boss Level is when things turned sour. It became clear that the games controls were a bit too wonky for the platforming it expected. Also, the physics system is just unreliable. Sometimes I would find myself getting hit by a blade and simply falling down. Other times I would be hit and fly across the arena, meaning the whole dismemberment system wouldn't work. Being able to continue the level as a torso or reattach to my body was cool, but didn't matter if I was thrown across the level to a place where I was forced to restart.  The camera can also be frustrating. There are pendulum style obstacles which pose little threat when presented swinging side-to-side. But When they swing front-to-back the pendulum can get behind you and completely obscure your view. Essentially making those moment of blindness a crapshoot. Will you make it? Or will some other trap come out and annihilate you while you can't see?   This is a game I would have really loved to recommend. The premise is interesting and I really enjoyed the levels with pure platforming, rather than trap avoidance. But I just can't. I played for 80 minutes and probably only enjoyed myself for about 30 of those minutes. The only thing keeping me sane for the other 50 minutes was the game's surpsingly good soundtrack. Maybe another installment with more finely tuned controls and more dependable physics would have me recommending the game.",

            "review_text": "I really tried to give this game the benefit of the doubt. It's not the gameplay mechanics that is the games biggest flaws. It's in the presentation. The music and level design.  Jumping right in. The level design for me fell mostly flat. The levels are just so boring. Even when the game tries to mix the variety up it's still just as boring. 'Deadly lasers again!?' The levels themselves look drab and uninspired. There are lots of collectibles in the form of stacks of cans through out all the levels to knock over or 'collect'.   The music in the game is probably the most horrible aspect about the whole game. Each level consist of a generic techno/80's style synth song that seems like it's only 20 seconds long. When levels usually take around 15-30 minutes to complete depending on how good you are you will hear the same song over and over again. I usually turned the music off in a level after 2 or 3 minutes of hearing it.  The game does offer a decent challenge if that's what you're after. There a lot of times where you have to be really precise with your platforming. You will die quite a lot. There are 'medals' for making it from checkpoint to checkpoint with all your limbs intact. Which brings me to my next point.  If you get an arm, leg, both arms, both legs, or even your head cut off you can still continue on. It does make the game even harder running on both arms just being an upper torso.  All in all it feels like the game could have been more than what it is. The gameplay isn't the worst around, but a lot more care could have been put into the design of the levels I feel. It's a 4 out of 10 game at best. Definitely not a game for me.",

Any doofus with a basic grasp of PC gaming can pick it up and play.  -Gameplay Fast-Paced and EXTREMELY challenging, this game is a pretty solid 3D platformer, with enough goofy, blood-spattered antics to provide a fun experience.  -Graphics and Performance This game looks great, with colorful semi-cartoonish visuals reminicent of  Borderlands  and runs smooth as butter even on my POS intel laptop. CONS:  -Bugs Yeah, this game is in need of a patch or two. I often caught myself pinned under a trap, not dead, but rendered completely immobile, or I ended up phasing through a wall and into a chasm. Not frequent enough to be a deal breaker, but still somewhat annoying.  -Soundtrack and overall Sound design This is the game's biggest weakness. Its repetitive techno soundtrack sounds 'meh.' at first, but it gets real obnoxious real fast. There is also the issue with sound effects that last too long, or repeat far too frequently. I won't give away too much, but if you've played the game, you'll know what I mean when I say: 'WILL SOMEONE SHUT THAT DAMN CLOWN UP?!'  Overall, 7.5/10. Far from perfect, but a hell of a lot of fun.

The game is only starting at 10$ though so it's still worth it but that's the main problem is it leaves you wanting more, most people I've heard from seem to feel the same way they keep suggesting to the developers of the game on the steam forum to include/implement some sort of steam workshop or level editor so the community can make more maps/levels to keep playing, which would be cool. Also, the developers are on the forums frequently to address issues within the game to supply answers updates and patches so that's a good thing. This game is still new I don't know how much more the devs will add to it but the other day there was a patch since it's around Christmas time and the player now has a red winter hat on which is cool =}. Not a bad experience with this game, just 1 level really irritated me, Rafting Coaster where u are on a platform that moves throughout the level but it moves so slow it makes attempts to get to next checkpoint take well over 5 minutes each, took forever to beat that level. The rest are great though, my favorite levels are Moonshine Deadzone and Ed Fillet. Check those out on youtube they are fun in a challengingly hard kind of way.",

The game is challenging and generally any mistakes you make are due to your own lack of precision. I made it through the whole game and had fun most of the time as I enjoyed the challenge.  The only reason why I would not ever recommend this game, which is a VERY BIG flaw, is that the ragdolls are very badly designed. For a feature that is so core to the gameplay (especially on the last few levels), it amazes me how random it gets. People seem to blame the games physics in general, but everything else in the game seems to behave normal.  When you, or any other object in the game, becomes a ragdoll, anything can happen. You can clip through traps meant to kill you, walls and platforms, or even get blasted outside of the map. Without the ragdoll mechanic the game would be amazing and fair, while still being very difficult. However you will often die, get stuck in a wall or fall off a platform for seemingly no reason and have to start the round all over again. This is most noticeable on one of the last few levels that is literally impossible to beat unless one of the ragdolled objects get stuck in the map, which seems like really lazy design for a game like this.  TL:DR Not the challenging game it is supposed to be due to poor ragdoll physics. ",
