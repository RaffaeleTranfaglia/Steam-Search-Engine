            "review_text": "A surprisingly decent game that is perfect for some short term casual play, Elder Sign: Omens appears based off a boardgame, but has made a fairly good transition into a video game. The player takes control of four investigators and chooses who they will be dealing with, with each adventure having their own opponents with their own effects on the game. At first, you'll find easy tasks to do in your home museum. Later adventures expand past the museum, letting you go to other locations as well as giving you entirely new tasks. These adventures can be played in any order as well.  While I can not say I know the original boardgame, it does appear to have been four player. It seemed odd at first that they would turn it into a singleplayer game then, but after some playing I can safely say that the four investigators only barely interact with eachother, so instead of four players each playing a fourth of a game, they instead have one player playing the whole thing. Controls are not awful either, as one would expect from a boardgame made into a video game.  If you do not like random chance, this may not be something for you. The entire game exists of smaller adventures, in which you get what are essentially dice and need to match dice with the situation's requirements to pass. You may be lucky and complete a difficult quest in one try, or you may spend 3 turns failing at one of the simplest ones. Luckily, you have items and investigator special powers that will help you get through them. In the end, you will always have an element of random chance in it, but even then, it's a pretty good way to spend some time during slow periods.  And, of course, Lovecraft. The adventures have plenty of flavour to them and seem to be pretty close to how one would play through a Call of Cthulhu game, although clearly with less pen and paper roleplaying stuff and with more singleplayer set-in-stone stories that you can progress through.  Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn  Be sure to keep him that way, it would be a shame if he woke. Humanity probably wouldn't like it. And you're probably part of humanity.",

            "review_text": "Had to buy this one, I own the physical game and all 3 expansions, this game is very true to the physical one, like what they have done replacing some elements with alternatives such as locations on a map instead of adventure cards and glyphs in a book instead of rolling dice, although it says in the description that it includes the expansions, having played the expansions it should have added some extra things to the game for instance Unseen forces expansion should add Bless and curse cards and a black curse die along with a white bless die, the Gates of Arkham expansion adds gates and Skill Cards as well as event cards and Omens of Ice should add adventures in Alaska with weather tokens and a Day chart that lasts 7 days (at midnight you advance one day along the track) but I haven't seen any of these for sale or in the game so if anyone can enlighten me as to where in the game you find the expansions or what they are I would be grateful, one thing I did notice was some of the investigators from the expansions but anyway a great job has been done it's a fantastic game and you don't have the hassle of packing everything away at the end, I highly recommend it.",

You roll your dice, hope to roll well. If you do, you win. If you don't, you die.   It's very simple.  However, it's not bad. If you need to pass the time, you can enjoy the rich atmosphere of the game, and try to beat your highscores.  Being a fan of Lovecrafts Mythos, I enjoy the game simply because of the theme.",

            "review_text": "As Cthulhu mythos fan and a fan of the original board game, Elder Sign Omens is a great game.   Pros: (spoilers?)  -30 investigators, many more options than in the board game and more unique abilities -unique Old Ones abilities, the board game had abilities but they only ever added a specific die/glyph roll to effects. Omens make this much more varied and therefor different from each other -Cthulhu, Nyarlathotep, and Ithaqua have engaging multi-stage challenges that spike the difficulty, great for when you need a real challenge** -Many more adventures that in the table top version, more other worlds and monsters as well. There are a few basics that will pop up in most games but almost every game will be different -Very nicly done graphics and music, they set the tone of uncertinty that follows Cthulhu mythos -Each adventure and monster has a sentance or two in lore that explain the situation,** -This game is hard. All the tabe top games in the series are suppose to be difficult and this is no different, enjoy the challange  Cons:  -30 investigators, that is a lot of abilities you need to learn and balance, also several of these are locked untill you have met in-game requirements -Single player only... you are required to use all 4 investigators, while playing solo allows you to think out your own stratagy the system begs for a multi player, but unless you have friends who all want to sit at your screen, too bad -The tutotial sucks, many things are half explained such as the glyphs are based off the d6 dice used in the table top version (hint there are NO terror/tentical glyphs on red/yellow) watch this:  Table Top Elder Sign  for some help -This game is hard... I mean really frikkin hard. The format allows for a much faster version of the table top game but this is by no means a casual experiance. The dice/glyph rolls are random, as are the adventure and some mythos/midnight effects. after a few games in a row that all lose because of bad luck will have you cursing the ancient ones names. I suggest the occasional rage quit and some L4D2 stress releif before returning to kick thier butts down hard.  **Extras:  -If you are a glutton for that really hard game play the Cthulhu, Nyarlathotep, and Ithaqua specialty campaigns have extra rules and requirements above and beyond normal game play -The Lore sections on the adventures and monsters is never even hinted at in game, clicking the monster or adventure NAME after starting the adventure will show you the lore",

            "review_text": "I like the game. I like the original board game. I don't mind difficult games.  But....  This digital version kinda ruins the original.  - The probability gen for the dice rolls is WAY broken. Example: I need 1 scroll. I roll 6 green dice to completion and never get a single scroll. Chances of this happening are 2.2% (97.8% success chance). Yet It happens all the time.   - They've removed some of the original rules to make this even harder (being able to stop a mission after completing a step). This rule NEEDS to be in the game, because sometimes a misson is impossible. I've had missons come up that ended up with a monster attached to them later. The mission + monster sometimes requires more dice than what you can even have (your max dice is 8 but the misson may require 9).  - Really difficult missions popping back up RIGHT AFTER you just completed that misson (Im mainly referring to stuff that has a midnight effect, thus you may have just spent all your turns in a round just to get rid of it)  Original game is great.  This game is just something that will ♥♥♥♥ you off until you finally give up.",

Result is a game that has user interface working like bad games from 95'.  It has SUPER complicated rules (comming straight from tabletop version), but only tutorial or help is in form of videos you have to watch before the game, that just recite the rules in machinegun speed. Theres no way to memorize all the stuf that way so at the end you are just more confused. Or are we supposed to run the vids multiple times and make 3 pages of notes to play this game ?!  The gui has dozens of changing icons, yet NONE of them has a tool tip ! Clearly an artefact of Android version, that nobody bothered to fix in the PC version. Overaly the gui is a complete mess. You never see any idicator of where you can / should / shouldn't click and what it will do. All clickable areas are just active areas on big illustrated background usually without any button-like border and without any text explanation.  Ultimately I believe whoever made this game was sadly just a bunch of freeware amateurs. Don't waste your 14 $ / E on this. If you are a fan of Arkham Horror line of board games, as I am, you will be better of buying a tabletop version of Elder sing !",

However, upon actually playing the game I found that the difficulty even on the easiest of the Elder Gods is hard. You instantly get handicapped in every single match and there is no easier verison or even strategy (you are dependent on dice that almost always roll against you).  This was not worth the money I paid for it.",

When computing dice results, the game makes it HARDER to roll the results you need. Why do this? The original designers of the game put some thought into how the probabilities work. Why? Do you as game programmers work for Rogaine and want your players to lose all their hair. 3. The software game developers did not implement some skills and abilities of the player characters correctly. This takes away things the play can do to make 'solving' an adventure easier. You've already made it unpassable from #2, why do this too?  (I play the board game version of this and these developers omitted some Mythos cards in the board game that seem to do nothing. You know what they're for? Those cards are to make the game playable. You know those game designers balance the game as part of their job, right? Just one more of a number of things the developers screwed up!!!)  Inconsiderate and irresponsible software game developers. Can someone reprimand them for me?",
