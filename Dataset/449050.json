If your goal is to find something to do while you wait on hotdogs to become perfectly edible, and or you have to take a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, this is the game of you.",

Superpowers (pick the same thing 3x in a row to use) are rockwall which defends you against 1hp of damage, scissor attack thing which does 1hp damage (i think), papermind which shows you what your opponent will pick for the next turn.  That is the entire game in a nutshell.  Play only if you want to practice playing rock paper scissors strategically, and also if you don't like yourself/want to listen to annoying sounds and look at â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ graphics.",
