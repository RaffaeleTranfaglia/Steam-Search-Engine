I'm leaving this same review on each of the Trilogy pages because it's an across the board review of 5 out of 5 or 108 out of 100 or A++ or whatever you can think of. This has been one of the most emotional, roller-coastering rides of my life, and it happened in a videogame. One that's entirely text-based. You start off as a little hero still trying to figure out who you are and you end as a big one, no matter what path you take, knowing exactly who you are. You'll go through so many ups and downs and surprises and disappointments and happiness and sadness and successes and failures, you'll get into all the great beat em up action that comes with being a hero and all the baggage and consequences, too. But if you stick to who you are, just like in life, you'll pull through and make the right calls, and become a legend. The fate of the world is in your hands. The fate of your world is in your hands. Now get to it. And buy this trilogy.",

I am enamored with game. If you loved those old choose your adventure style books well this up it to ten because you can make actual choices that have bearing on the story. I have only one other thing to add....I can't wait for part three and I would love to see me more of this on valve.",

I can't wait for the squeal and I am interesting to checking out more of this companies games. It is just wow!  The story is so mature and in depth. It brings up some great issues that affect modern society and makes you think. It really spoke to my open minded, activism personality yet I could see had options for other views too. This is how more games should be.  The way the story flows I am ready to go for another play through of both games to see it from another point of view. So many choices I wish I had done better. That I wish I had done differently. That it just makes me want to go again.  I highly recommend this game to anyone who is up for an intellectual story that really gets you thinking and emotionally attached. However it's all text. So be Warned.   (Feel free to comment with constructive criticism about my review. I am always open to seeing how I could do better or different.)",

These games have a unique function allowing you to continue with your character already made from the previous installment, but new people still have the chance to play it as well. I have some issues with the story, but mostly from my own feelings from the first game, that I plan not to spoil. On that note, this one seems easier to replay with even more strategies to make this a game more enjoyable, which I might do, but after marathoning all three games, I think I'll take a rest from it.",

What appeals to me the most is that you really have many opportunities to be a kind of hero you like and how your choices define the outcome of the game.",

I wouldn't call this a choose your own adventure, as it is linear but I don't actually feel thats a criticism. The confines of the narrative are really driving the personality of my hero, I've just finished this chapter and am booting up the finale, I feel really immersed. I've been playing these with two steps from hell orchestral music (goes great) I didn't think I'd ever sit down and play a text game in 2014. Good job, an experience I'm glad I'm having.",
