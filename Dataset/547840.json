I can tell that the team put a lot of love and effort into this game.   I would reccomend this to someone who wants to play a quick, simple, point and click story game with quality characters and a good storyline. This was a great game to play between homework breaks!",

            "review_text": "I was a Kickstarter backer for this game, and I was so pleasantly surprised with how much I loved this game! I actually gasped at quite a few parts. And I love that this was made by little girls learning how to make games at such a young age. Just fantastic, all of it. It's a really funny game, sometimes darkly so. If you enjoy point and click games with more dialogue and story than full on button mashing fighting, you will probably love this.",
