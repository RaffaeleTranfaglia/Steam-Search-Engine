I've played for a few hours, starting over dozens of times, trying to find that perfect build that will get my colony seed going. I love that it's difficult and your decisions matter.  Then it happens. Maybe an hour into a map, and the AI just gives up. Out of my 7 starting colonists, 6 of them are hungry. There's piles of unprocessed food in the storage building waiting to go into the processor, and no one will move it. ONE lonely engineer will stop what he's doing, grab some veggies or meat and takes them to the machine for himself. He eats, and then goes back to his tasks.  There is no way to schedule or rank work. (The max build queue is kind of a joke.) There is no way to manually assign tasks or override a colonists broken path. A sandstorm hits, and I have a colonist that walks out side and just stands there in it for no reason. My bots finally broke down. One engineer walks right by, and the other is standing right next to it, but refuses to attempt repairs. I have piles of spare parts and materials waiting to be used.  If a game doesn't have a strong AI to actually simulate well, it needs to allow for granular manual control. This does not. Once you've reached an equilibrium the game just stops working. I love difficult and challenging games. This isn't a challenge, this is an infinite loop of broken. All in all it's a very simple game that had the promises of complexity, but failed to deliver. I would say the AI is a joke, but there would actually have to be an AI to rate.  Do yourself a favor, give this one a pass.",

            "review_text": "A very enjoyable space-themed, resource-management/grow-a-colony game -- Banished in orbit, if you will.  Good graphics, smooth gameplay, an evocative and low-key space-synth soundtrack, and a real challenge at the highest level, even once you get the hang of it.   Highly recommended if you like strategy games, though it would be great if the devs revisited this with an expansion -- new planets/maps and expanded build options -- since as it is now, once you reach the mid-game plateau, it is only a question of rinse-and-repeat expansion until you achieve the endgame milestones.  ______________________________  ETA:  I'd also like to add that a large number of people criticize the AI and the apparent randomness of the workers. At first, I found this annoying and disconcerting, too. Each specialist attends only to their specialty, and works only the number of hours allotted. Essentially, the colonies are founded by the worst sort of socialist bureaucrats, with strict work laws and no overtime.   This is totally unrealistic, of course, but it IS what makes the game challenging. It demands that you anticipate colony-destroying disasters -- hunger, lack of medical supplies, lack of power/water -- before they happen. You have to plan your growth strategically, by managing supply trading and the influx of additional colonists with great care, so as not to upset the applecart and try always to run the colony with surpluses.   There in lies the game.",

            "review_text": " Planetbase is a fantastic little 'city builder', with minor survival elements, set in space. Your aim is to control a small group of colonists and help them to build a habitable self-sustaining base on an uninhabited planet.    You start with a handful of colonists, a couple of robots and some supplies such as metal and food to get you started. Since your colonists only have spacesuits with limited oxygen, you better get building quick. The tutorial is smooth and in-depth and it walks you through what you need to know about surviving without giving away too much and ruining your ability to try new things your way. There are three planets which range in difficulty of which two are locked. You can unlock the more difficult planets by completing 'milestones' or challenges on the first planet. These range from Surviving one day to having 300 colonists. Once you've picked your planet you can name you base and the game begins.  Planetbase seems quite hard at first, I killed off my first group of colonists in 4 minutes because I rushed to build larger buildings instead of the basics but after restarting I quickly learnt from my previous mistakes and was able to keep them alive for a whole day. Once you realise the needs of your colonists and how to manage your resources without overbuilding everything comes together nicely. Managing your power, oxygen and water levels is your main goal at first, then you'll want to start expanding your base and building mines for ore, bio-domes to generate food, labs for research and pseudo-meat production and much more. You can build a launch pad so other colonists can join you which they will as you start to build bigger and better things. Whilst building your base you can also manage the percentage of your colonists doing specific tasks (producing food, building, guards, ect) adding a nice little micromanagement element to it and allowing you to feel more in control of what is going on. You can also change production levels giving you full control over making sure your resources are never depleted fully  The graphics of the game are very beautiful with a lot of attention to detail, however the interface is very very basic looking. Everything is just a little green square with a symbol.  Planetbase is similar to Banished in the fact that starting out can be very difficult and once you make a big mistake it's often too late to fix it by the time you realise. I find this very enjoyable as I am careful with each of my resources and have to think about what is the most important room to build with what I have rather than just placing one of every room and leaving my colonists to do the rest.  There are some negatives to the game, though none of them are too bad. It would have been nice to have a pause button without having to press escape. I appreciate that the default speed is already quite slow but when I start a new game like this I want to browse all the building types at my own pace without the game progressing without me. I also found the random meteor showers a bit problematic at first. In my first two attempts at playing I lost 2 colonists in the first 10 minutes in one, and a newly built room in my second. I think it'd be better if random events like that didn't happen on your first day or so on the lower difficulty to give new players a chance. One last little grievance is dead end rooms (certain rooms can only be built off of one other room meaning it increases walking time when colonists are travelling through he base). I don't think there is any real point to this and it does end up slightly limiting your freedom in base building.    Overall it's an enjoyable but difficult game, so if you enjoyed Banished then you'll enjoy this as they have the same punishing but rewarding game style. Planetbase is one of the better base-building games out there and is a must buy when on sale if you enjoy this genre. ",

            "review_text": "I'm really loving this game but I've hit a couple problems that seem like they should be solvable with a patch.   I'll put the TL;DR at the top; the colonists need to not kill themselves.   One, recycling something to build something else is nearly impossible sometimes because the materials are dropped where the thing I'm recycling is and I can't build something else there until those materials are gone. My workers don't always clear out that space in a timely fashion even if I have storage space, and this is a showstopper if I'm clearing out something like an air generator for a bigger one.   Two, building multiple paths around the base is tricky because often my engineer/bot will get stranded in the middle of the base. There should be some sort of pathfinding for the constructor to get out or to only build connectors from the direction it approached from so it will never get stuck in the first place.   Three, I should be able to micromanage a little better on the production. Maybe some sort of queue was needed. Often I'll run out of spares or something even though the factory was prioritized so that the bioplastics could be used on something not crucial, and then my power grid might fail because a solar panel went down. I understand I have to plan better in the first place, but this aspect seems punishing rather than challenging, especially for the first few bases I made where everyone died and it seemed like I could have avoided that if I could put items in a queue.  In the same category is not being able to prioritize time. For example, I can tell workers where to put resources, but it seems harder to tell them which machines to work on first to refine resources. In other words, if I could prioritize spares over semiconductors by putting them in separate factories, the workers seem to put bioplastics and metals in the spares first, but still will work on either machine if there are enough resources to fill all those machines. Also, if I need bioplastics asap and have two bioplastics refinery machines, then sometimes a worker will go and work on one machine, walk away, and another worker will walk up and work on the other machine. In the long run this doesn't matter, but if I'm in a crisis that needs bioplastics to be resolved, this is incredibly frustrating to watch.   The last one is impractical, but I wish colonists would act more like real people. Like, do you really need to be watching TV when your oxygen generator isn't working because you haven't built that second water farmer I asked for yet? Is it really impossible for the biologist to pick up the worker's slack a little when we need some bioplastics for medical supplies because all the workers have broken bones? Maybe the solution would be to have all colonists able to do certain jobs outside of their specilization if it's simple enough, but at reduced efficiency, or to have a non-specialized worker.",

            "review_text": "WHERE DID MY WEEKEND GO? The first review I read was 'Its like Banished, but in space and you build a colony' and I was sold. For the price, you can't beat it. Its worth it at the $19.99 price point if you're in to this type of game.  I thought I would only spend about 10 hours playing the game. Right now I'm at 18 hours. I can see myself playing this game about 50 hours total over its lifetime.  I'm pretty big on the idea behind $1 per hour spent on the game. With Planetbase, I played it all weekend and amassed 16 hours of play time and I'm just now getting to beating the first of three planets. I had so much fun that I'd consider going back and restarting on the basic planet at some point just for kicks.  The simulation depth is slightly shallow when it comes to being creative and customizing all the things, but I'm willing to look past that because of how much fun I'm having solving problems. I've heard complaints about people with the AI, but I've not experienced much of it. For the most part, its been pretty predictable or at the very least, semi-logical.  One legitimate complaint I have is that its moderately narrow in terms of the player's creativity (some would say 'player agency'). I enjoy the solid challenge for survival that it throws at you, but once you figure it out then there's not much in the way of creative solutions, the game starts to lose its shine.  But looking past some of its flaws, I'm a simulation enthusiast and this game hits the spot. 8/10 from me.",

            "review_text": "Well, I like this game in general.   I like the feel of creating a thriving base. There is something fulfilling about seeing ships landing, and little dudes walking around doing stuff.  But, as others have pointed out, if you start a game, and the location is bad... just restart the game. There is no harm in doing that. But you CANNOT overcome a bad starting location.  I wish there was more low level information about the morale, and I wish the AI was smarter about who does what and when.  For example, take supply ships.  If you do end up selling to a trader a bunch of goods, you don't get anything OFF LOADED from the ship until ALL OF YOUR IMPORTANT AI's have stopped doing what they are doing, and carried stuff TO the ship.  I really wish I could set priorities for my little dudes... some things are really more important than others, and some things you want done with certain people.  There really is no insight into how the game decides who does what.  In reality, I would imagine that there is some base commander who divies out the work, and sets daily work schedules. This game certainly should have something like that. If it did, you could perhaps then be able to actually set priorities without overriding the in-game AI.  I do like to play this game though. I enjoy whiling away the hours just building bases.  It's fun.",

            "review_text": "Ill keep it short.  Planet base is one of the best base building / micro management games that I can think of in recent history. Its a slow methodical game that requires you to keep everything in balance if you want your colony to grow. The three planets each offer different variations on the same theme with different starting conditions. They each have their own environmental issues to deal with as well. For example the third planet which is a moon that has no atmosphere means you will be relying on solar power. The second planet has a dense atmosphere that light doesnt penetrate very well so its wind energy.  The game has a way of throwing you curve balls right when you don't want it to causing you to make sudden changes to what you are doing to adapt, if you fail to do so a colony that was thriving that you spent a couple of hours on can literally be rendered unsustainable within a few seconds if you don't have what you need when something bad happens such as a sudden solar flare or armed intruders enter your base and you have no armed guards to fight them and they proceed to gun down all of your workers or biologists.   Fun game, easy to get into and widdle the hours away tweaking things and watching your colonists do their thing under your iron fist.    Couple of A.I. issues in the colonists that I have noticed, just minor annoyances in their priorities as they go about doing their thing. Other then that. Solid game.  If you are interested in this kind of game set in a sci-fi/futurists setting then pick it up. I have easily gotten my money's worth out of it. Trying to finish up getting all the achievements.

It feels very empty and the goals are super easy. The more achievements you unlock the more planets become available and there are only 4. The last one rated at suice difficulty. The problem with this difficulty is it lacks imagination. It is only difficult because it rains when the sun is out and the wind doesn't blow so you can't generate power until you get a lightning rod. I mean how lame. It's hard because it is you aren't provided proper power. Lazy...  Also there is just nothing going on. I mean yeah once in a while you get the people who come shoot up your colony.

To sum up why I CAN'T recommend it...  - The devs will not be adding more content in the future (such as Banished) - AI are a hit and miss at times. I mean they're the core of the game, so if they are performing poorly, then you're done for - The replayibility may be dull, no random generated planets or anything - The 'challenges' may seem fun and difficult to play with (solar flares, different weather conditions per planet) but these get really old very quickly no matter how you approach them into achieving a grand colony - The UI looks like a UI from an alpha build from the early 2000's. It needs an overhaul - To get a good colony going, you have to set up a base almost the same way everytime  There are many more downsides which I will not mention because I wanted to address the most important aspects of the game  So to conclude, it has so much potential and so many hours of entertainment (yes I have only 9 but I can see how it is down the road). It is a great game, similar to Banished.   What may sway my decision in the future (to recommend this game) is if the above aspects of the game are improved, fixed, etc.  Don't forget about Steam's refund policy. Worse comes to worst, you can ask for a refund. I think you can have only two hours max of gameplay to request a refund. Double-check the policy.  EDIT 11/18/15: As I've played last night and the devs commented on this today, the AI has been improved a lot, however I don't think that's enough to sway my decision to recommend this. However for some people, that is a make or break, so if that applies to you, then I would now recommend it for you since the AI has been improved.",

            "review_text": "--Review for veterans who love the genre--   I know you were looking for THAT space station game that would finally replace Space Colony, Startopia, etc. from your game library. This game, while passable, is NOT it.   - The COLONISTS are not an improvement from older games. They stand around doing nothing or pick the jobs that are just not needed right now. - You CANNOT assign beds, to make it easier to get to work. - There is no fast travel to reach the farther areas of the base. So if you plop down a cabin, which is a room that assigns colonists ther own PERSONAL bed, and then they have to work in the other side of the map. Well then thats quite a problem. If I could asign the bed to a someone who works nearby, tha would be awesome. - You can hire five different colonist types. Who cares what there names will be, because your going to have hundreds of them. They do NOT improve in skill nor can you improve their equipment. The only ones that get an upgrade are guards, you can give them a generic gun.   The INDUSTRY/ECONOMICS. You can make robots to help run the base. Miner/Constructor/Carry bot. Make generic 'guns' to either give to your security force or sell to traders. - You can sell any other surplus items you over produced in the base. Its very easy to have a surplus of food. - You CAN prioritize rooms, but not specific jobs in that room, like making specific materials you need. This forces you to specialize rooms, for example I have a small factory room at the corner of my base that can produce 4 weapons at a time. I turn this on every time I hire guards.  - You can also trade with passing ships but you CANNOT prioritize transporting goods to the landed trader. So if your base is just too busy the ship cancels trading and leaves. - You can limit the amount of items your base can produce which will stop your colonists from expending all your resources. - So the fun really is in managing a 300+ person station with a bad interface and Bad AI.  Tech  No research. You buy every new tech from the traders. There are 8 improvements. You will not use all 8.  Combat/conflict  Automatic lasers that shoot down meteors that get to close. Guards man security consoles to look for intruders. The guards can then track down these intruders and use the gun you gave them. You can also hit the red alert button to allow colonists to go to the guard locker and grab a gun. Which I never needed to do yet as the guards have easily destroyed every intruder. Sadly no other items like armor or medkits. No other enemy aside from the generic 'intruder' 15 hours in.  Biggest caveat ---&gt; There is very little control over the people, aside from 'prioritize this room'. And we all know AI tend to be dumb in games like this, which is why I like the option to help it once in a while.    While pretty to look at and I got to kill 16 hours playing it, I realize, it has LITTLE OR NO REPLAYABILITY. Once you figure out the right build order and how to stabilize there is very little challenge in the game. The only challenge remaning is figuring out how to grow larger, population 300. And for someone like me, I was hoping for more gameplay. The completionist in me might just reach for the 300 just to say that I did. But really after 15 hours, other games are more interesting/challenging/fun.   Don't get me wrong its an OK game, which can be played with one hand. So if you have to be bedridden for a few days this game is a good fit. But not worth the asking price. Wait for a sale less than $10.",

Everything is very connected in the game, so you have to have a big picture view as you plan out your base. There are some issues that still need to be fixed, pathing for one, but they can be overcome by adjusting your layout. I've seen a lot of negative reviews, some seem valid to me, others just seem like complaints because they didn't get a perfect, massive base on the first try. So take the negative reviews with a grain of salt. It may take a couple starts but if you try to learn from your mistakes you'll see how to get past them. Also, don't rush to end a game because you are in a death spiral, I've seen games where you get down to three colonists from 50+ and are able to fight your way back with a little luck. Challenging game that takes a little effort.",

All failed horribly, but I learned each time and now building up a working base is simple on the first planet.  There is only one drawback, and that is that sometimes you can get saddled with a nearly unusable starting area due to simple siz restrictions. Not that you can't build a survivable base, it just won't be big and will hold you back from Milestones.  My recommendation to new players: just because you can build a landing pad, don't let colonists land willy nilly. Plan your expansions and turn off colonists frequently to allow you to catch up to your needs after each expansion.",

While the construction options become universally available very early in the game, you have to constantly balance each type of colonist you have with the resources you are producing/using.  This is more difficult then it sounds. Run out of food ? Colonists start dying pretty quickly. No electricity ? They start dying very quickly since there's no oxygen. You didn't start building spares to repare the solar panels and the wind turbines ? They stop generating electricity and your oxygen goes out.  And this is on the first available planet - which is also the easiest. The other planets get unlocked over time and they each have their own peculiarities and disasters.  Overall an addictive, simple game that's not necessarily easy.  10/10 recommend (and it's a must-grab if you find it on sale/humble bundle).",

My initial expectations were pretty low, because i didn't read any reviews or comments beforehand. I really didnt know what to expect other than 'hey the pictures of the game show decent graphics, and looks pretty easy to build a large base.'   Boy was i dead wrong. After 10 - 15 more attempts plus multiple tutorial walkthroughs was i able to build a base large enough to reach prestige lvl 100. I thought 'If my base is known by everyone, lets open up the landing pad for settlers.' Settlers came in droves, realized i couldn't provide enough food for everyone fast enough, people began to go hungry, a couple settlers died, and then boom! 30+ settlers died of starvation. Wasn't until after 20 that i realized my science lab was prioritized and all of the biologists were trying to make synthetic meats and not tending the plants.  This game is very adicting and extremely difficult because of the random events. It would be helpful to add a queue to the food machine and water fountains just like how there's a queue for the airlock.   Great game and I hope we keep get these great patches.",

            "review_text": "First off, before all you review reviewers go cutting my head off, this is one of my first reviews.  On to the game itself. I think this is a fun game. However, there are a few, rather annoying issues.  Issue #1. The resource 'tracking' mechanism (AI in general) needs improvment. In my experience, the colonists seem to ignore resources that are needed.   Ex. I sat for three in game days needing one metal for another Solar panel. My mine had four boxes of ore in front of it but instead of grabbing those, they would go and attempt to mine more, at which time they would then put the box of ore by the front door and go take a nap. This leads into the next issue, the priority system.  Issue #2. Priorities don't seem to effect the colonists. The entire time I had the above mentioned issue at hand, the processing plant required to make the resources needed was the only priority building. But they continued to mine and use what they did eventually make into metal, into spares that were not required. And yes, I did turn the spare count way down.  Another example of this issue is with repairing robots and sturctures. In a seperate base, I had a robot, broken down in front of the airlock. I had several spares on hand however nobody bothered to repair him. Later on, part of my power grid failed due to the lack of upkeep on my windmills, thus resulting in loss of power and a catastrophic shutdown of the entire base. After a desperate attempt to get power restored, everything just kind of fell apart and everyone died. All of this resulting from the colonists not repairing the robots or...anything for that matter.  Issue #3. The colonists are insanely needy. It seems like almost half the time they are off in some random room, wasting time when something really needs to get done before they all die. I mean, I don't know about you, but I wouldn't be sleeping 10 hours a day, taking my time eating, and working out to de-stress if my life was in danger and something that was going to keep me alive needed to be built time-now. It doesn't matter if you are angry because it's either angry and alive, or, hap...oh.. wait, now your dead.  Now, I'de like to turn and point out that this game is worth buying, if you haven't already. Personally, I think this game is awesome. It is pretty fun to play and well worth the money spent. If you are looking for a fun time killer and are into this style of game. I recommend it. The random occurrences, although they happen way too often in my opinion, are pretty cool. A few times I've been sitting there with no windmill, biting my nails waiting for the sandstorm to pass as I watch my power bar plumit. Or, been yelling four letter profanities after the connection to one of my buildings get nailed by a meteor. It adds that exitement that games like this usually lack.  All in all, I'de give it a solid, maybe generous, 7 out of 10.",

The objective is to build and survive, which is not easily done, It takes some strategic thinking and planning, with a decent learning curve, at least at first.  It is a fun game and I would recommend it to any city builder or banished fan. But it falls short for a few reasons;   Once you survive, build your base up and make it sustainable, the only thing left is to expand. While this can be fun for a while, theres no real threat to your existance, outside of bad planning or expanding too fast. It doesnt seem like you can run out of resources, nor have any outbreaks or virus's etc that might take a toll on your colony. The threats that do exist are manageable.  Buildings are almost all unlocked within the first 10mins of the game, theres no real research to be done and so there's nothing really to strive for. Sure you have to combine resources to build new things, and things you need - but thats a just a waiting game - which brings me to the last point;  Its a waiting game a lot of the time. AI can be a bit stupid and doesnt always do the right task in the right order. ie if your low on food, and theres plenty of things to make up a meal, then go and harvest the food and make them! .. they dont always. So because of this, and the amount of time it takes to make some of the ingredients to build an object, you can be sitting watching your colony work away for long periods of time, and not be building a whole lot. Or having stacks of buildings under construction and waiting for construction materials to be made (but the AI is too busy doing something else).  Overall though - its a fun game. I only paid $20 for it, and it kept me entertained for a decent amount of time. I'd replay it casually here and there, but once its mastered, its not a game I'd play religiously.

PRO: The idea of resource management, keeping your sims alive, trying to expand, trying to keep supply at an optimal rate etc. This game has it.   However I do want to have more options, sub-management of rooms like more items for sims to interact with, or visual interaction, AI control as to where you want a particular sim stationed on. More in depth analysis on the planet, more resource parts, components variation etc.  CON:  Room expansion and upgrades: While this game allow you to make 2 to 4 levels of upgrade (stronger solar panels, windmills, storage, etc) you are limited in the option to upgrade the lower tier to a better one, first you must recycle (destroy) the existing building or structure you want to 'upgrade' meanwhile the resource will remain on the ground and unable to place new structures until the resources are removed. This make upgrade very tedious and the potential to lose incoming resource in the meanwhile.  AI pathfinding: While the sims move on about on their own they often take longer route to a destination, or wait in line for example an airlock being busy with more robot or sims using them.   Uninteresting later levels: While you have expended your base, planted an airport station. The amount of disaster by visitors are at minimal at best, camera spot them right away and all the intruders seems to do is just shoot at random colony's personnel until they are shot to death by the security.   The whole visitor and radio interception to help in coming ship, to heal their soldiers, or stranded humans need a place to land and recuperate is nice and all, but it is only fun the first few times.   I would like to have prison, colony having a bad mood with other, or seems to be wreckless at their jobs, or put other lives in danger would be a nice addition. The lack of water, food, sleep, electricity, Oxygen, fellow colony member dying etc react differently, and therefore change the behaviour of sims within an idea. or something.   This game does have lot and lots of potential, to expand with addictional resources and more mayhem that is done by your own colony personnel to control as well as more natural disasters other than sandstorm, solarflare, meteor, and blizzars and thunderstorms   Don't get me wrong, the game is good as it is but feels lackluster. As a gaming with basic mechanic and expansion building it is worth a try. I do hope the developer are working on a overhaul DLC or expansion because at it core, the idea is good, the initial impression is impressive, but after about 8 hours of game play it seems to be the same thing over and over with the other planets, except they have their own version of enviromental disasters which isn't that big of a difference to the other planets other than visuals, windy or very sunny, or hardly no wind but lot of sunlight and vice versa.  Final Verdict: Do I recommend this game? Yes.  Do I think it is worth full price? No.  Do I expect an expansion that fix the issues mentioned above? Hopefully.  Does it desevers a DLC pack or big content updates in the future? Definitely a big Yes.",

Problem is I don't have enough metal, alright lets make some metal from all the ore I have. Prioritize the processing facility, a day goes by and not a single person goes to the processing facility to turn the ore to metal. Two days go by, not a single worker goes to produce metal. After a week I turned off everything nonessential to get someone to HAVE to do it. Not a single worker goes to process ore. Annoying as hell.

FALSE SPECULATION:  Firstly, people say that it's too complex or challenging and that it's very difficult to keep your colonists alive. However, it's complexity is enough to add depth to the gme without making it too difficult to understand. Not only that, but the game's difficulty and challenges means that you have to think critically about the decisions you make-the exact purpose of a strategy game.  Secondly, other reviewers say that it's too simple and has only two resources. However, the game is really extensive and realistic with a vast amount of in-game guides and tutorials which help explain all of it's features. Although there are two raw building resources: ore and starch, they are then refined into metal and bioplastic and can be used to create semiconductors, guns, spares, medical supplies and robots.    IMPROVEMENTS:  Firslty, I don't know why toilets/bladder is not an in-game feature. It seems like this would be necessary for such a realistic game.  Secondly, I believe that there should be a larger variety of bots which are suited for the colonist's jobs. Constructor bots are like engineers and driller bots are like workers so why can't there be medicinal bots to mimic the medics, guard bots to mimic the guards and farm bots to mimic the biologists.   In conclusion, this is an amazing game with so much to offer which perfectly captures it's purposes as a strategy city-builder.",

Your own colonists almost seem to go out of their way to kill themselves by only feeding the same kind of food to meal makers (thus ensuring malnutrition by not fitting the extremely limited random recipes the devs force you to use but don't give you any way to actually use), priorities are extremely limited and entirely ignored, thus ensuring that things will be built and repaired in the worse possible order, and so on (you spend so much time fighting the Artificial Idiocy that in any other game you'd almost think it was intentional - although most definitely not fun -, but the lack of depth and of any consideration of proper design and implementation makes it clear that it's anything but intentional, and that the devs are either simply not capable of implementing a proper AI, interface, and mechanics...  or they just don't care . Or both.).  A game that's challenging because of interesting and challenging mechanics is fun; a game that's challenging because its poor design forces you to fight all the time against its bugs, design issues, poor implementation, and extremely limited and poorly designed user interface  is not .

Oh, and to top it off it claims to have Steam workshop... but the modding capability seems to be so limited that the only available mods are useless scenarios, instead of components, buildings, and rule changes that could actually fix this crap, so don't waste you time and cash buying it expecting it to be fixable with mods, because apparently the devs are either too self-centered to let their users fix their mistakes, or too incomeptent to make the game properly moddable (my bet is on both).

            "review_text": "I dont normally review games but I have to say I am bemused with the negative reviews for this game and have decided to leave my opnion as some people may find it useful.  So far I can see two negatives points being made as reason for the game being poorly reviewed, one I strongly disagree with and one I agree with somewhat however feel that to give this a negative review based on these two points is extremely misleading and makes me question the motives of the reviewers as this is a very fun building / economy management sim. Any real fans of this genre will feel right at home with this and 20 - 50 hours of fun for 12 pounds is a good deal in my opnion.  Here are the points:  1) AI is garbage.  In my 20 something hours of gameplay I have experienced poor AI on one occasion. A constructor basically stopped working and would go to work on something, but then stop immediately and idle. I deleted the node he was trying to work on, and he started working again.  That is it. I have built a base with everything in it, 150 population and 80 robots. That is the only AI error I have encountered.  I think people are missing a core mechanic of the game and confusing it with AI not working. Let me explain.  When your colonists needs become severe (orange - red), they stop working. The only thing they will do is try to fulfill that need. Guess what, if you cant fulfill that need, they wont work again. If you have no colonists that are free to work, well you lost the game. Time to rethink your build and start over.  In one negative review (the most popular one), the reviewer explains that even though his colonist was carrying food, he was starving to death and this means the AI is garbage.  What it really means is the reviewer does not understand the mechanics of the game let me explain. So you can only be carrying raw food which is grown in your bio sphere or in your lab. This is not ready to eat. For it to be ready to eat it needs to be delivered to your meal maker which in turn uses it to produce a meal ready for your colonists consumption. There is the possibility he may have been carrying a meal which you have imported yes. however it still needs to be carried to the meal maker for it to be consumed by a colonist.  Now remember colonists wont do any work if their needs are severe, so no matter how many meals you have or raw food, if there is no meals ready in the meal maker/s, and all your colonists are starving, well its gg.  Once you understand the mechanics you make sure you are always one step ahead. Power supply, food production, meeting needs of colonists, the golden rule is dont over expand if you havent considered the impact it will have on your economy and havent sufficently upgraded your infratructure to incorporate it.  Blaming poor AI in my opinion is because players do not understand the mechanics of the game. As stated in 22 hours I have had to restart maybe 6-8 times, however every time I learnt something which my made my next base much better. The reviewer also talks about The more colonists you get the more of a problem this is, however in my opinion this is the complete opposite. The more colonists you have the easier it is to maintain colonist needs as if some stop working due to `their needs being sever others take over the work and you can in time fulfill the needs of all.  You may find it unrealistic that a colonist starves whilst there is raw food available, that is fair enough. But that is not poor AI, This is a core and valuable game mechanic, which is part of the games challenge.  I hope that clears this issue up for some people.  2) The game lacks depth  I agree. Right now I believe there is 40-60 hours of game play here. This will involve you building all the buildings available and creating a successful base on each of the planets available right now.   There could be so much more to what is a fantastic core game. More buildings, more resources, more needs and more events. Rival planet bases inhabiting the same planet of you. And my main suggestion once all the things I have mentioned and more have been added, a campaign.  I think this games is perfectly set up for a campaign each with diferent objectives etc. For example you get a base with a robot facility and X amount of semi conductors, however you can not recruit workers on this planet etc. (some tweaks to job roles maybe required but you get the idea).  The ideas mentioned could turn this game from a great little city builder with 40-60 hours of gameplay to a all time classic with 100s of hours.  Summary  Despite the poor reviews this is actually a highly polished and extremely cohesive and fully functioning economy/city builder simulation, which will provide you with 40-60 hours of absorbing, challenging and fun gameplay.  If you like this genre and enjoy games which are a challenge and require you to use your brain in order to progress then this really is a must buy.",

For all the earlier complaints, I've never had anyone starve to death in a room full or food, or die of dehydration next to a drinking fountain.

Another small bug is it seems and im not positive yet if it does it every time, but if you have more than one starport or landing pad (in my case I had 4 of each set up) and more than 2 trade ships land and you want to trade with them one of them tends to hang up and never complete the trade.

Also the basic game is well done. Production, energy, food, water and resource management is smooth and logical, same with base expansion. The game looks decent as well.  So what is the flaw? The problem with Planetbase, and the reason I cannot recommend it at 20 euro, is that while it is a good game it lacks content and depth. You have four planets with slightly different looks and modifiers but still very much the same. Within the first couple of hours and after your first base you have seen everything, unless you want to do everything again in a slightly different environment. The only real challenge is early game to get the base rolling and then it is just a matter of you not messing up any balance in the resources as you expand.  While it can be enjoyable, specially the first few times, it just feels a bit hollow. If you can find it for less than 20 euro, then you should consider it.",

Granted the graphics and the detail to some items are very nice, the music could be changed to something less 'sleepy' and the AI's need to be worked on a bit. Sometimes it's as if, when you play sims and you lock your sim in a 4x4 wall and try kill them, they just wanna do stuff, but then when you open the wall, they don't do anyhting except eat all your food, crap, sleep, eat, drink crap sleep, rarely do the task you need (even though you've put that specific part of High Priority) then when your colony starts struggling because a few dumb AI not wanting to do their tasks, all of that hard work you have done had been ruined by something that could of been fixed so easily and quickly. Despite the mixed reviews, I for one enjoy the game regardless of repetitiveness. People complain a lot about competitiveness but then find out they play Diablo 3, WoW or another repetitive game yet flame this one, this one is no different. I hope the devs keep a close eye on the game and don't let it slowly drift away because they have got something very special on their hands. and IF by some miracle they somehow impliment multiplayer, I can see this game shooting up even higher.",

Yes, it's cleaner with about 5 buttons, but there are some aspects of the game that would be better if you could get to them without having to go through submenus.  2) Have a bit better stat counter. I know how much power I'm generating instantaneously, but I don't know how much power of each type (Wind or solar) or how much they can power at their peak efficiencies. It would be nice to have a bit more detail into things like this.  Overall, I can't say the experience is bad.

            "review_text": "While the game's concept is wonderful, its execution leaves much to be desired, and Planetbase has become the first Steam purchase I've ever had refunded - and I bought into Starforge!  I desperately wanted to love this game; the idea of growing and managing a 'realistic' extraterrestrial colony is an itch I've needed to scratch for years, and when I saw this game on sale I scooped it up right away.  But for all its potential, Planetbase has absolutely been a letdown for me. Here's why:  1. The micromanagement system is terrible. You cannot control individual colonists, which is fine in some respects, but terrible in others. For example, every so often, solar flares or sandstorms threaten your colony and any colonist standing around outside during such a storm will suffer damage and eventually die. This means that keeping your colonists indoors during these events is essential, but the only way you can do this is by building a specific colony room, equipped with a specific control station. If you don't have the resources to build this, your colonists and their robot friends will simply stumble out into the jaws of death without a care in the world. This is a problem and it completely ruined the immersion element of this game (not to mention ruining my playthrough).   2. Related to the first point, the AI is, in its current form, terrible. Absolutely none of your little people have any self-preservation drive and will happily wander out to their deaths, unless someone in a control room somewhere pushes a big yellow 'alert' button to keep them from suiciding like a pack of highly educated lemmings. This isn't a feature; it's a bug.  Your colony specialists will often stop what they're doing in the middle of a job and wander away to do something else, leaving what might in fact be a critical job undone. Rather than simply queuing up jobs one after the other, your colonists will instead work a job until they get bored or distracted, at which point they'll wander away and come back at some random future time.  If a room is given priority of production, you might get colonists to go in there and work all of the machines present, or some of the machines, or only one machine for half of the time and another machine for another part of the time... it's something of a crap-shoot, really.   Those are my biggest issues with the game, and they were big enough to convince me to ask for my money back before the 2-hour deadline expired.   Who knows? Maybe Planetbase will improve with subsequent patches, but I don't pay money for promises or hopeful expectation; I pay for completed, polished games.",

It is a game with players going through many heart wrenching(not emotionally), mind breaking, hair tearing, eye poking, intense sweating and swearing on many situations. In comparisim of the difficulty between build sim games (I played), Banished, Anno 2070 and Planetbase.   Planetbase is probably on par with Banished for me. AI in Banished seems a little better for me. But in Planetbase, the AI system really hates me and frustrates me the most, where a Engineer/Bot constructs one building but not the other next to it. For example they choose to build the building but not the connector afterwards. Especially on startups and in a crisis where you need that particular building to be built. Workers tend to be a little inefficient due to the many things they do (mostly anything that involves hard labor). Piority tab is just something for you to click on but its up to the AI to do your bidding while you are watching them in agony. They also tend to build the things that are closest to the spacepot at start up and from the base after you got it built up.  I was also hoping that there would be some sort of a slidebar that controls the efficency of the AI Humans (by category) and Robots to do their jobs better.   What I do hope in the future for a patch or expansion (which may or may not happen) - AI System taskbar to control the efficiency of the Humans AI and Robots. - A piority queue system? Something lets your workers know what to build next and what not.  - Another panel for the Alert system for easy access once you build of the Control Centre. - Tweaking of the Human AI with Negative Status, they should be working on half efficiency instead of completely dropping their task and Idelling around the base. - Machines that uses materials should go first instead of Buildings. - Some sort of Emergency Back up Generator to last through the day? (Or half a day depending on how much power has been stored in it.)  (There is probably more to add but this is the best I could come up after unlocking the second planet.)  In the end, Planetbase is a management game with a huge hope of luck that 'stuff does not happen' when you are just starting up your game. For example, Worker getting an injury when you got no Medbay to cure him, Random Meteor hitting onto your SolarPanel/Wind Turbine/Power Storage and situation where you really want natural wind to blow across the globe but does not do that. *Especially on the 2nd Planet which I am currently on.*  But once your base has been built up for all self-producing machines or up to Medicine/Spare Parts for your Wind Turbines and Solar Panels. You are pretty much set and have to be cautious of keeping your power management up and expand cautiously. Only time I had trouble was multiple intruders attacking my base while I was in the middle of setting some furnitures down for my Dorms. I had to back track everything to the start of the menu and towards the Security section to put on High Alert for my guards.  In other words, if you like Management games that are really hard, about the same levels of FTL and Banished. Go for this game. It takes a couple of times of trial and errors to know which to build first and hope for the best of nothing happens. If you are uncertain of it, ask a friend who has it to let you try a game or two. Though be warned that a good game can take a couple of hours to get it right to your playstyle.  Cheers to all playing as well and fingers cross on random encounters in the game.",

Managing your resources is crucial, as using them all doing one thing might result in your entire base failing. I highly recommned this game for those who find colonizing planets interesting. It does have one slight issue that lets me down however, and it is the fact that once you have constructed a fully functional and stable base (Which may i add is quite difficult), the game becomes rather repetitive and you begin to run out of things to build and do. If the devs implement a bit more content for later on in the game such as more difficulties to encounter (various different disasters such as mal-nutrition from eating constantly veggies or vitromeat, having crops being infected by a certain disease thats mutated and spread to others crops which needs to be stopped by bioligists otherwise all crops will die and stop producing, machines inside factories, robotics facility etc causing injuries for colonists). Adding some new feautures to the game such as more various types of ores, which can be smelted down and used only by certain structures, rather then everything constanlty using bioplastic and metal. Adding some more structures such as a nuclear generator (where uranium has a very rare chance of being mined in mines but can be used by a nuclear generator to produce a constant power, however it could affect nearby colonists with radiation if used too frequently, but could potentially save a base if solar panels and wind turbines are not functional) and posibbly a communications room, where colonists can utilise it to communicate with home planets to increase their morale, and also having care packages sent to assist in stabalising the colony. But besides that one issue, i absolutely love this game and look forward to see its future develop shape it into an even better game! :)",

This of course means that as a player, your strategy is to overengineer your colony, and thus again - it's too easy. While a light touch on engineering your infrastructure can lead to disaster, all you have to do is over-engineer your basics and ensure that your colony survives, and then the game is on easy mode.   The game treads the line between micro-management and macro-management, just like Banished and Prison Architect, ensuring that you actually don't care about any of your individual colonists - yet quickly, a small mistake can send your colony into the rubbish bin of history.  Ultimately, the game has insufficient depth to last beyond the playthroughs necessary to earn all the achievements.  That being said, it's a lovely game, well-thought out and with a wonderful graphics set. If you're into a management game that you can burn through fairly quickly, go ahead and pick this game up. If you're looking for something more enduring and engaging, look at Cities: Skylines. I don't regret buying it in the slightest, but a more dollar-conscious Steam buyer should avoid.",

In the 2nd planet if the wind doesn't blow, you're screwed as well.  I find myself often sitting at 4x speed most of the time waiting for minerals to collect.  I give it a thumbs up though, b/c extremely promising style of game, esp since it is a city builder sci-fi, needs more stuff, like trying to send your soliders at other cities. Patting down intrudters or zapping them.  AI is a little bugged, will build the building then run all the way back around, then another guy will come buidl up the bridge.  After you build a solid base, get past 30 guys, you pretty much enter the game on easy mode as well, difficulty curve is getting to 30, most of the buildings, and a few soliders to fight off intruders.  Also you have to micromanage a TON in this game, shutting of power nodes (b/c wind doesn't blow lol), boosting/forcing buildings b/c AI is pretty stupid to build stuff you want built. Things don't get built in order, you cannot direct people to build something. You can't build if there is 1 resource block covering the area you want to build, lol, so in the beginning very annoying b/c you have to recycle your ship (again challanging too).  Lots of tips I could share, but, get a good 10-15 hours of the game imo if you like city builders and sci fi, and are inbetween games. Game worth it on sale, b/c very challanging imo.

Also, when a starving 'worker' then finally gets some food, the oven needs to cook the next meal, and instead of waiting, the other starving workers simply leaves the canteen and properly end up dying at some random spot!  I must admit I only had about 5 carrier bots at that time, but when people are starving, forget all other ♥♥♥♥ and go for the food, fill all canteens so there are plenty of food and tables to eat at, do NOT just try and fill a single crowded canteen!  So yes, the game has potential, but is seriously flawed and not worth the money... It may just be me, so if you're ready for a challenge where a perfect base suddenly hits a magic size killing lots of persons, lowering your happiness, making it harder to get new people back, then forget all I've just said and buy the game, you'll love it!",

Simple in that you don't have an overabundance of resources and stats to manage, yet elegant in its easy controls and interface. Beautiful graphics that don't tax your system processor, which is amazing as there are plenty of uglier games out there that burn up your CPU and GPU. I have had this game about a week and have sunk almost 100 hours into it so far just on the first two of the three available planets. Still a little buggy, I will occasionally come back to one part of my base to discover that a room is locked down, and as far as I can see there is no way unlock it. I know the devs are aware of this particular bug and are addressing it. It's nice to see a game go through pre-release and release with an active team of developers, which Plantbase has. I just load a previous save, which thanks to the healthy autosave function is easy to find. 9/10",

So I jumped in with very little clue what I was doing, the tutorial covered the very basics of sustaining a base, but nothing else. I thought this would be a problem, but I found with the tool tips and descriptions as well as the liner unlocking of buildings helped.   My first 4 times playing were straight up failures one failure took me 4 hours of gameplay before everything just went wrong, I probably could have saved it. but I was so frustated I just turned off the air, until there was silence. after a couple tries I don't see how the gameplay would get old quickly, so many things can change the entire pace and direction of the game. the decisions you have to make are meaningful in the present future and very long term.   some of the things I love, the graphics, the random terrian the minimalist UI and the AI works under most conditions.  some of the things I don't like/think should be improved The UI, I apprecaite that there are not tons of menues and screens always on and in my face, but putting everything in one corner. some things I think should be outside of the submenues, like the security setting, when you need to change to yellow or red alert, going to the menu clocking managment options and then clicking secerity and then going to the pop up in the middle of the screen and selection which alert you want to set, feels way slow.   On the topic of UI I would like to see better statistical information, and predictive information like how much food you need for a civilian a day, and compare that with your storage, and beyond anything that is a convince like that I would really like to see more information about your storage, and people.   I don't feel like im in charge, but instead I am doing things and they are reacting, and sometimes in a way that I don't like or in certain cases in a way that they kill themselves...  There is no way to force a person to do a thing, if your colony is failing, it is extreemly hard to fix, as without being able to force one or two of your people to do one thing before anything else, they will make small problems worse, during food shortages ive noticed not so hungry people eating while someone is starving and never can walk to the food in time to get any(in that case though they did make it).  the priorty system is meant to fix the above problem, but it does not work all the time, in my expirence it works if everything is running smooth, but if all your people are tierd, hungry, thirsty, sick I have never seen them do what I marked as priority but instead do the least important things, like carry supplies to storage, when I could really use the medic to be making medical supplies in the machine that has all the reqired materials in it and is 70% done.   I still would say the AI is good, Ive never seen pathing issues or anyone getting stuck, if they are not doing anything there is a reson why, even if its stupid like they are tierd or where hit by an metor.   The game is fun, every decision matters and I cant count the amount of times where one night the wind did not blow and power went out, keeping the situation under control with your hands behind your back(becuase lack of control) is really fufilling when you succsed.

I realize the modules are on a daisy-chain systems but why not make them where you can cut the lines and make several, small, independant units if you decide to change up one large chunk into a cluser of smaller, more efficient, units? Also, people delivering food, who are on the brink of starvation and not eating it? If it comes down to an unbalanced diet or death, what would anyone choose? Finally, engineers not paying attention to the bot center or the factory...this is just odd. I have had an over-abundance of them and they still 'ignore' those areas and WHY, bots cut down on their labor and give them a chance to focus on more intense issues.

You have very little control over the details, only the very broad outlines. This would actually be fine with me, if the AI and logic of your colonists didn't suck so bad.  There are other bugs and inconsistencies in how your colonists behave that just make the game frustrating, not fun.  There IS the skeleton of a decent game here.

Yeah, the AI has some quirks, but they're quite consistent and you'll eventually get used to it. There's still a lot of potential for adding depth and more direct control to the mechanics, but watching my extraterrestial base develop and my colonists going around their business felt satisfying enough to recommend. Will require some trial and error and unfair treatment by the RandomMeteorGenerator, but that's life.  Pros: Nice atmosphere (well, once you place the O2-generator), clear buildup in complexity of your base as you progress, mouse controls feel really intuitive (love the scrolling to resize modules) and the classic city/base-building feeling of achievement seeing your base grow is definitely there.  Mehs: The graphical interface isn't all that self-explanatory, and even the mouseovers are a little too summarized. Camera is kind of wonky as well (EDIT: Apparently this is a design choice. Shows what I know about art, I guess). The fact that there is no pause-button is a legitimate choice on itself, but it feels a bit weird not to have one while there not only is a fast-forward button, its use is even recommended multiple times in the tutorial. Combine this with random disasters (although largely preventable with mid-game technology), and you might warp into a slaughter at 4x speed, without any way to assess the situation.   Suggestions: It would really help to see what colonist will take care of what project. You can click on them to see their direct queued action ('Picking up metal', 'Taking metal to airlock', etc), but highlighting their end goal when selected (and vice versa highlighting colonists involved when selecting a resource or something under construction) would give some more insight in their sometimes-not-so-obvious-priorities. Some kind of research-tree as an alternative to buying techs would be an obvious route to increase depth by adding another layer of prioritizing.",

This would be save-game compatible, since components can still be anywhere in the building in the save file, but would be directed to optimal locations during placement. Sickbays, Control Centers have components of different sizes, so this might not work for them.  I'll edit this with additional suggestions later.  edits:  Please make the number keys 1-4 set speeds pause, 1, 2, and 4.  Please make cutscenes skippable. If i want a cinematic experience I'll go watch a movie.  Please ask for confirmation before deleting an under-construction building with resources on it. It's easy to do this accidentally, and it's a pain to wait for the resources to get moved to rebuild the structure.  Please consider allowing placing a building on top of resource blocks.

            "review_text": "A lot of reviews liken this game to Banished, and this is true for the most part. However it's important to keep in mind that this is not Banished, and should be judged on its own merits. There are some fundamental differences between the two:  In Planetbase, you cannot assign jobs to workers. You're at the mercy of the population spread (which you can influence). Unlike Banished, you do not have the ability to forward build (In Banished you could essentially create your entire town from the start of the game, then just pause/unpause development as needed). Instead, you'll have to wait for buildings to be fully built and connected before you can start building components inside them.  Now, the Banished comparison aside, how does Planetbase fare on its own merits? The short answer is: brilliantly. Expanding your base can be a little obnoxious at times (forget upgrading or replacing rooms, most of them form integral attachments to other links so you'll be forced to expand outwards), but creating a fine balance between expansion and self-sustaining livelihood is a delicate and precise maneuvre. Bring in some colonists to boost your productivity and watch in horror as they consume all your food and stop working, which causes a chain reaction where eventually you'll run out of parts to repair your machines, and you can only watch in horror as your base slowly falls to pieces (unlike Banished, where you can retract your buildings to reflect the population drop). Destruction of your base through various means is a real possibility at all times, but most enjoyably, it's entirely avoidable with clever planning (save for an unlucky meteor shower early in the game). Technology expansion comes in the form of traders who arrive at your landing pad. These traders also offer many lifelines, such as providing food or spares when you're in decline.  The biggest advice I can give is expand slowly! Be sure to disable colonists arriving until you've regained self-sufficiency.  The AI can be somewhat useless at times, but I have not run into any situations where the AI has been at fault for issues with the base; moreso they fall under minor inconveniences where a stray meteor might hit because nobody's manning the telescope, etc. Generally, these are not game-ending scenarios.  On the surface, Planetbase is simple at its core. You juggle resources to expand your base and survive. At its more intricate levels, any lapse in attention can bring about Apocalypse for your unsuspecting colonists. I would love to see an 'evacuation' option for when the end is nigh, so you can watch them flee the base instead of starving to death or dying of oxygen deprivation.  Pros Off-world building experience. Nice visuals. A genuine possibility of mass extinction with any lapse of judgement. Very little time spent 'waiting for resources'. There's always something you can be doing. Traders can save a struggling base.  Cons Can't pre-design your base. Can't replace or upgrade most inefficient or obsolete buildings. Can't disable single components in a room; you'll need to disable them instead. Can't pause building production to save it for later (the best you can do is prioritise other buildings).  Overall, this is the colony/building game I've been waiting a long time for. Easily a 9.5/10",

GREAT JOBS DEVS, KUDOS TO YOU. It works great, the game is fun and great.  PS: IF you can, please open it more to the community (e.g. modding) so it can become way more.",

            "review_text": "This game was fun at first and I've played 18 hours of it. However it has a flaw that cannot be overlooked and has made me make a negative review. The way building works, verything must be connected via tunnel/tube. There's an invisible ring around every building and nothing can be placed too closely to one another. This is fine when building in the beginning; however, once you start building larger versions of the smaller structures you are forced to make your compound span more ground because there is no upgrade system for domes. If you delete a structure that is surrounded, you cannot build anything but that EXACT SAME SIZED STRUCTURE in it's place. This is incredibly frustrating when you have made a array of solar panels, wind turbines, and batteries and you HAVE to keep them there unless you rip EVERYTHING down. In the time it takes to do that and rebuild, everyone would have died from lack of oxygen because there's no power. This game-breaking system is not only unrealistic and pointless, but frustrating to the point of madness. You are encouraged by the way the system works to make a web of scrunched up buildings and power arrays. There is no way to build where you are able to make room for the larger, or in some cases just slightly larger, building foundations. Straight lines? No. You'd have to jut out to the side. Hexes? Same problem. They wouldn't be uniform and you'd run out of space. The game would be completely great allbeit very difficult if it were not for this system. But this is a city-building game with a defunct building system. I'd like to praise the detail however. Each person has a different specialty. Botany, engineering, stuff like that. It's a really good game and it's a shame this was so horrifically overlooked.  I recommend what this game is with an even slightly more improved building system. I can't recommend what it is now.",

            "review_text": "The tutorial shows you the basics of what you need to survive the first 20 minutes. Every time I go to expand though, the happiness of my colonists drops. On top of that, the food requirements are very inconsistent it seems. It seems impossible to feed a starting population of 7 with one greenhouse worth of plants especially after the starting food runs out. It makes it feel very unbalanced, and I want to throw my laptop across the room from the noise it makes when food is running low.   I wish that the food problem was my only complaint, but for some reason I often find myself watching all of my facilities falling into disrepair. Not due to a lack of spares, nor the available colonists to repair them, but rather ALL of my colonists are idly wandering around the interior and couldn't be bothered to do much of anything, whether it's maintaining the plants or maintaining the solar panels. The fact that I can't click on individual colonists and set them to a specific task is INFURIATING!!! Instead, I have to sit and watch the base I've built, to be as efficient as possible, get run into the ground by autonomous (sort of) meatbags who have no concept of self preservation.   On the subject of self preservation... If there's a sandstorm outside, or a solar flare, maybe if a group of psychotic people are running at the door with guns screaming at me; I'm pretty sure I would know not to go outside and take a stroll. Not these colonists! They'll practically throw themselves at the opportunity to die just for the hell of it. Unless of course you have a control room which is what you need in order to inform the colonists (manually) to stay inside and safe from death...  Having just played the game, these are the problems still fresh in my mind which in my opinion make the game nearly unplayable. I've played it for a few hours but I just can't get past the learning curve that is usually simply to figure out in other games of this genre. In concept, this could have been so much better, but due to some glaringly poor design flaws with both the in game interface as well as the behaviors of the colonists, I can't give this more than a 2/10.",

            "review_text": "Hmm where to begin. I guess I'll start by saying this game is good to a point. Here are a few things I like and don't like about Planetbase:  Pros: 1. Addictively fun 2. Simple to learn 3. Interesting mechanics, such as having to manage power through day/night cycles with solar panels and wind turbines Good variety of buildings with decent interior building options  Cons: 1. Incredibly stupid AI 2. Poor prioritization options 3. No options to power down bots. This was a big deal to me in the beginning since sandstorms wreck the ♥♥♥♥ out of them, and you can't stop them from getting destroyed in a storm when they have an action queued. Especially so when you don't start with engineers who are the only other able bodies who can build things. 4. And this is really the biggest problem with the game in my opinion, but RNG will always ♥♥♥♥ you. You will get hit with a meteor near the beginning on a major building with over half your guys inside, and they will all die. Maybe you'll build wind turbines to generate power during the night only to find the wind hardly ever blows. Or maybe you'll run out of spares which are needed to repair your solar panels/wind turbines and be powerless to stop everything from dying. With the amount of resources you need to build things, spares included, and the slow rate your workers generate these resources it will happen more than a few times.  All in all the cons are more of a problem for me than the pros so I'm gonna say this game still needs more work. Don't buy this game unless you prefer to rip your hair out playing perfectly only to watch everything die anyway. This is definitely the Dark Souls of city building games even though it won't be your fault if you lose.",

Colonists cannot do any other skill than the one they are trained in, even in the face of death. This undermines the immersion and creates a sense that the game is less about strategy and adaptation and more about learning what the game wants you to do to build the optimal base.  2. Building placement is underdeveloped. You cannot, for example, build from corridors, or build different shaped buildings, or dig underground, or build extra corridors to speed travel around the base. Also the location of things like solar panels, power storage, or wind farms doesn't matter, just slap them down wherever (you can't stick them up on hills or mountains either for example).  3. There's not very much to build or to do. You don't get enough information to form any sort of bond with your individual colonists and though the choices of other planets to colonise and places on them is great, it's the sort of idea that is begging for a more detailed game to make use of it.

If I don't do that I end up with many of the complaints you see on the forums, and when I reverify after the fail I get a 0 0 patch file that then verifies but the extremely bad AI and many other things stop.  Okay review I really loved Banished but PlanetBase does many many things Banished can't do without mods. This game is NOT Sime City or Cities Skylines, so First and for most if you enjoyed or like Banished or Stonehearth or that type of game then this is your style of game. I love figuring out how to place things for best results and keeping them as happy as possible. The challenge of overcoming disasters, that are your constant companion, and you won't keep everyone alive because of them, Colonies on the edge of life are high risk. I recently suffered a Starvation event, that I'm afraid was my fault. and I made it even worse, because of how I don't use constant trade ships, so from high 70's to 12 before I was able to recover and they are over 100 strong now and pretty happy to boot. making cons from vistors creating a good security set up, to keep out intruders, are all possible and attainable as the game is now. Yes it has bugs and they are responding to those and adjusting the game. You can easily die your first day, the tutor to this game is you friend something many game tutors are not, but it won't hold your hand once you start building your own. Management and learning to build within the game provisions makes for a very good game on its own, blindly playing and not learning how to play it, will never be a success. If you expect to do what ever you want, You best learn to do that withing the games structure or failure, death and lossing, will be your reward. That is how a game is, this one is no different stay in the rules, grow a great colony, There is most deffinetly a Real Life quality to this game, of things we can actually almost do and soon may well do. I'm enjoying this very much. And I may add way better then those others I mentioned and this point in this alpha's life.

The simulation is decent, it takes a while to put things in order, some resources are hard to process.  However I have already spotted 2 significantly weak spots:  1. Once you get your colony to 60-80 people and everything is working nicely, it is difficult to be motivated to do anything else. You quickly get all buildings and all extra research, which is not much to talk about. After this there is not much going for you, no incentive to continue playing.  2. You cannot expand your colony the way you might wish. For example once you start building the structures that are 'inside', you cannot build such structures outside of the initial 'grid'. So basically you need to have EVERY structure connected to EVERY initial structure. You can't just build another airlock one screen away and start another part of the colony. So there are situations in which the mountains will simply block the possibility of building 'covered' structures, so you run out of space. The max I reached is ~130 people and space was already insufficient.  All in all I don't regret the purchase, but I hope that in future patches there will be more freedom.  Oh, and you cannot access the Settings while in a game, you need to Exit in order to turn down/up the music, this is bad user experience.",

At first I had issues with the colonists not doing what I expected them to do, and it was quite frustrating because there was no method to directly instruct them to do stuff. After some time playing and figuring it out though, this began to bother me less and less.  Pros:  Does require some attention and thought to play.  Does have some challenges that have to faced.  You can spend hours tediously building a planetbase (which was kinda what I wanted). Not terribly stressful to play. Pretty reasonable overall.  Cons: After the initial base setup is complete, it does just kinda become tedious. It's no longer really challenge to keep your base going after you have made it self sufficient; so long as you keep expanding power and reasources, nothing much can happen that can be very catastrophic. The challenge diminishes as the base expands.  The AI has it's qerks. They're not so bad that the game is unplayable, and once you get used to them, it's not that much of an issue. It still can be annoying though.  Structure placement is sizing doesn't always make sense.   Improvements that I would like to see made: In-place expansion/upgrades of a structure - It would be nice if I could disable a structure, and be able to upgrade it to a larger version of itself.  Flexibilty in room placement - For exterior structures the have the base pad for cheap expansion, I would like something similar for structure connections. Sometimes you really just want a long connection from one part of the base to another, as a shortcut.  There are some milestones that don't make sense - For instance on the last planet, to get all of the milestones, you have to collect all of the techonologies. One of those technologies is the giant turbine, which can't be used on that moon. So I have to either trade for or buy it, and it is useless.  Visitors - Never allowed them to land, and I don't know what purpose they serve...  Research - There should be a method of researching technologies insteading relying on them to show up on a trading vessel.   Final thoughts: This game actually has really great potential for future expansion and I'm excited to see what they do with it.",

Please take the time to read my entire review, as even though I don't recommend the game, I suggest you keep an eye on it.  I have bought many unfinished, WIP games, and Planet base is not my first rodeo. I Love the concept, and overall design and structure of the game. The main reason I do not Recommend the game is the state it is in. I don't know if the developer will finish it, but I hope they do. The main flaws are in the AI though, as I had 40 metal and 50-60 bio-plastic, and had my spares workshop on top prioroty. The game is designed so that you have minimal control over your base. Because of this, my engineers wouldn't construct any spare parts, and I was praying a trading ship would land with spares. When night approached, most of my solar panels and wind turbines had broken down, and my engineers still weren't making any spares. The metal and bio-plastic was sitting in storage while the engis were drinking vodka in the bar. A few nights later we lost all power and over %75 of my base's population was dead from lack of oxygen. This has happened to me multiple times, so I'm used to it, but it was just so frustrating.  I love the very hard early game though, were your decisions will have an immediate effect on your whole colony. The mid game is grittingly stressful as you have to expand your base just at the right speed, or else you will die. Then theres the late game, where the clunky AI sits around and sends you down a irreversible spiral of death and despair.  Oh, and the timing of disasters makes anyone who plays this game look super unlucky.  Overall the game is unfinished but could be great. Buy at your own risk.

The learning curve isn't overly difficult but can be unforgiving if you make a wrong decision. Once you've figured out the game though it's pretty straight forward.  The beginning is always the hardest since you're fighting time against your initial recruits and resources but evens out once you have the essentials down.    Towards the end of your achieveables in the maps, it can be a bit of a grind. Once you're at 100 recuits and are aiming to shoot for 300, it's more of the same, but you constantly have to be monitoring your resources otherwise you'll have a dead colony in no time.    Problems I have with the game: The module placement is very sensitive, particularly for placing beds. You must be very precise with the placement (within a pixel of each other) to get the most bunks in a module, which is a little tiresome.  Bugged TV placement. Some modules you can place the TVs right where you want them to, others wont let you place any at all, reguardless of having enough room for it. Also, some modules allow you to clip TVs together, allowing stacking of much more TV's than you're able to fit in a module.  AI pathing/prioritization. It seems that conditions need to be optimal for recuits to work at a particular module or building in order for work to get done. For example, you will have a engineer work on a building and will complete the building, but fail to build the connection required for it to function. It seems the recruits refuse for the o2 levels in thier suits to fall below green levels and will idle or take care of thier own stats before building again.  All quirks aside, this game is really enjoyable and while it may not contain the depth of other games of this genre, it has a particular charm to it that can really make the hours in your day melt away.",

It lacks goals, i feel like if there was other resources for example you could build your colony to be a commerce hub selling jewels, or a production colony building space ships? There is no Research, there is a lab for developing medical supplies and processed meat, but no researching of the colony planet, or making new improvements.  In many ways the game reminds me of the Evil Genius game, you have certain type of basic minion, (worker, medic, engineer, guard) you have your rooms, (control, dorms, staff rooms, storage, processing) but that’s it, there is no goal to work towards or to invest your time, you simple build a colony for the sake of building a colony.

Believe me, you will be hooked for hours without end. I like the music, the graphics are cute.   At the moment, however, there is actually nothing you could call an AI as in artificial intelligence. In truth, the tasks you order your population to perform are more or less randomly assigned to the available units, as well as the pathes they walk. You will often witness several of your construction units idling around close to a construction site while the task to build goes to the worst possible choice: some engineer who is on the opposite side of the base and low on nutrition and oxygen.   A regular occurrence is an engineer carrying the last needed material item to a building, then walking away instead of just building it. Another construction unit arrives half a minute later to construct the building but again walks off and leaves the construction of the connection to another unit, probably the engineer that carried the last material to the site in the first place. So it is a matter of pure luck if building a desperately needed oxygen generator or water extractor takes a minute or five minutes (bringing your base to the brink of extinction).  On top of that the pathing is also just randomly generated. If you got 5 airlocks to leave the base you will often witness your little people chose the worst possible way to move to a target location. Indeed Ive seen people die of lack of oxygen after passing 3 airlocks in a row because the 'AI' ordered them to take the detour through the 4th airlock for no good reason at all.  The worst effect of this random number generated instead of intelligent and efficience based task and pathing assignment code is however that all progress gets incredibly slow. All your plans take an eternity to show some effect. And it gets worse with the growing size of the base and the population. Adding a new solar panel to a 100 building base takes much much longer than the same task on a 20 building base. On top of that come the risks of mass starvations and the likes, and the only way to avoid these giving everything more leeway ahead, and this means throwing even more patience and time at the game.  Planetbase is a waiting game by design, you mostly watch and wait, and sometimes react to certain developments and sometimes give out orders according to your general plan. But the stupid 'AI' makes the waiting really hard to endure when your base grows larger.   Do I regret the purchase? No! It is quite fun for a while if you like the kind of management and planning game. And it is fun to ponder and discuss about the problems of AI design.   Would I recommend it? Yes and no. If you dont have much time to play video games, then no. If you have plenty of spare time and dont mind to become badly bored a bit prematurely, then yes. ",

It has its limits, and a good deal of quirks - but once you get the hang of it, it is a good game for what it tries to do.  The trick I have found is you cannot build big first and fast. Start small, expand cautiously - and make liberal use of landing privledges. Nothing wrong when knowing you can't take more in than you can handle. Expand too fast, spend too much too quick and you end up digging yourself into a hole you are not prepared for. Slow and steady wins the race, and this hammers that lesson in hard.  To me, this is the space survival management game I was looking for in other titles, and it does it in a very fair manner.  A definite reccomindation from me if you are looking for a good space survival management game.  EDIT:  Once I got enough play hours and kept growing larger and larger bases a major flaw is becomming apparent: the AI is spotty. They have done a number to help, but the core issue is a pathing problem that doesn't account the domes or connections as lines, but rather needs and a radius of search. The result is a habit to cluster, often overpopulating and draining resources much faster than desired. Its not unsolveable I think, and would hope it is patched more adequately - but aside from that issue, it does not dissuade me from enjoying the game.  It is just a hiccup to learn for now, annoying sure, but not unsolveable. It still leaves a rather astheically beautiful game that runs surprisingly well and hammers in a strong survival balancing act of how to grow and expand without overstepping your abilities. I still see this as a good reccomendation, but now with abit of caution - it is borderline punishing if you don't find a good way to grasp the AI issues, or at least until they patch them better.

Take Banished put it in space and you got the gist of this. That said in addition to managing food, shelter, building materials, a few more things to juggle. Air, electricity, water, yup your in space and run out of these you and yours are dead! Throw in some errant space debris that may crash into a key building and you may be dead. Game talks about weapons building and invaders but not that far along yet. Tutorial is easy well thought out but unless you got a great memory write down how to start with key structures., my first start we were all dead in short time, next time made it a lot longer until I ran out of building materials which caused the inablitity to make more food, water etc. So plan ahead and like many city, colony building games don't over build and have a plan. All in all thumbs up. Will see how the rest of the game plays out and hope we all don't die too often getting there.",

            "review_text": "I honestly enjoyed the game and therefore I will not dislike it. But it has a low replay value.  The game would be much more interesting if you would have to fight against other computer controlled bases. They could add more end game content, things to do when the base has reached maturity.  One challenge you encounter is to reshape your base, to take better advantage of the terain. Why is this a challenge? Well, you are not allowed to disconnect parts from your base. This unrealistic constraint also makes the entire base vulnerable to attacks or oxigen level drop. I guess it was the cheapest way to make the game interesting.  Should you buy the game?    Yes if you want a casual game, something to do for a few days and you didn't played other base management games in the last 4 months.    Maybe if you are in an altruistic mood and you want to support the genere and an expansion which may never come.    No if you expect much from the game.  ",

            "review_text": "I've enjoyed playing this game, but have a few constructive criticisms that if addressed I think would benefit the game.   1) The game has some more 'advanced' configurations but don't give you any means to control how to use them. For example, the meal makers will only produce 'Basic Meals' unless you provide a mixed variety of components in order to create them but there is no mechanic I've found that allows you to control how food products are delivered to the meal makers, so the vast majority of time it creates the Basic Meal despite the fact you may be growing a plethora of product that just doesn't get delivered in an order friendly towards a variety of menu options. Or you can create security stations that detect armed intruders, but there's little you can do stop them before they can kill off a good portion of your colonists.  2) Colonist AI needs an improvement for needs. When a colonist completes his/her task, they need to tend to their personal needs (feeding, sleeping, drinking, etc). I've found with a bustling commerce center they'll just work themselves to death delivering goods. It's not till the point of exhaustion or critical need than do these colonist stop what they're doing to take care of their own needs. A trade with multiple ships and a few hundred goods can wipe out a good portion of your colony.  3) The airlocks in the game are severly crippling, the animation sequence creates a huge bottleneck for travel, even with mulitple airlocks in the same area. With a bustling space commerce port and a lot of trade, expect to see colonists die by asphyxiation after delivering their cargo and waiting to get back in the base facilities. The effeciency of these airlocks needs a BIG improvement. For example, when a traveler exits the port a traveler waiting on that side should be able to enter the port while the door is still open rather than waiting for the animation to close the port and start the animation anew. This still allows only one traveller at a time through but could double the traffic in the same cyclic time.  4) The colonists do not have life cycle, but the robots do. Robots wear out, break down, and eventually become junk and are lost. A colonist is immortal and lives forever, unless ended by falling rock, lack of food, asphyxiation, or intruders. It would be an interesting dynamic to see aging and reproduction introduced to the game somehow. The need for medics would increase along with a wider variety of dorm styles shelters for couples? Not a deal breaker, but it does seem odd to gameplay to have life cycles for the droids and none for the 'noids.  Despite these criticisms, the game is quite enjoyable to play!",

That assumes you don't mind eventually losing, because you will under current circumstances, and that you are the type of person that does not enjoy the constant battle / zombie scenario. Mercifully, battles seem to be at a minimum and you don't have to waste your resources on constant weapon production.  Now, there is one issue I will mention that really really annoys me. I will call it the poor me scenario. You have these events happening and trading, such as it is, going on, you finally get the items you need to help your people and they do... absolutely nothing. Example: They are standing around doing nothing because they are hungry. Understood. We trade for food. There it is. And they do, you guessed it, nothing. Oh, except wander around the station - ok then go get food! Eat! Don't starve! Nope, they wander around until they starve.   Suggestions to fix the poor me scenario - allow a rescue mission or perhaps more colonists to show up that will care for these people. Or, make them smart enough to go. eat. food. no starve.  The other thing I would also like to see would be more planets.   I recommend this game. It is a fun game and relaxing when I don't want to fight zombies. This has actually become one of my top 5 favorite games I've played on Steam.",

You have to grow crops and harvest materials in order to survive. Power, and water must be managed as well as food made out of crops you grew. Several planets are availbile and each is unique in terms of weather and space, which each makes a differance in terms of what type of builds are best suited for this planet. Be it size wise or different types of power generation. Trade is possible, as you can be visted randomly once you have landing pads. Bots can be bought through trade, or can be made in your base. They are used to lower the load which would otherwise be done by humans. Bots are finish tasks faster and they dont tire or require food, however they have a limited life span and will expire after being maintained several times. Lazer canons can be built to protect your base from falling rocks, and lightning rods can be built to protect from Lightning strikes which would also generate power for your base. I find myself going back and play this game a few hours ever other week due to how relaxing it can be. Its constantly updated which is a huge plus for me.  Its worth noting that AI could be better, and your people can do some pretty stupid things. Its also worth mentioning that after expanding your base a bit, you start to get attacked by random visitors with no clear motives. Which gets pretty annoying as they typical cause deaths even if you have armed guards.",

I had a perfect base (this is the 4th/5th time now), nothing wrong, then got some visitors, which tipped the scale, I got a bit low on food, and ONE person out of 50+ died. The visitors left, but the moral was low, and welfare dropped to 0 (or close enough to prevent new arrivals). To make matters worse, it was a biologist that died, then there was one less to tend to the produce, meaning even less food being produce (and I think no one was working very well because of the low moral), and since the welfare drop was WAY too fast, no new colonist would arrive, so in time, everyone just dies off. :(  Another annoyance is that when building things, there's no % of materials going to anything else in the base. Medical supplies and repair supplies just stop when other buildings are pending development. A % of materials should be allocated to those as well, don't just stop them.  All that said, if the base starts to tank, take note why, then reload a previous save (since it is easy to quick save), then prepare for it. I think in most of my cases, I just needed to make sure I had a bit more biologists than I needed to make sure the plants were ok. The next thing was to make sure I made lots of money selling things in case times get hard (this actually did help tip the scales so my welfare could recover a bit at one point). Seems best thing to focus on is food and medical, then making money selling the medical supply surplus. Everything else seems to come second or third in priority. ;)  All in all, this is a very addictive game, and well done for the most part, so it does deserve a thumbs up over all. ;)",
