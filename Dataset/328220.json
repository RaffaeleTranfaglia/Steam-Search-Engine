    "description": "Wild Season is a farming-life sim that takes its foundations from the greats within the farming simulation, visual novel, and RPG genres and delivers them with a twist. Rebuild your farm to its former glory and beyond, befriend the townspeople and maybe find your one true love (of either gender!), and solve the secret of Bedford Valley.",

            "review_text": "I tried to like this game, I really did but...  Nothing about the game seems finished... including the actual game. Taking the episode approch, if you want to even finish this game you'll have to pay for the inital game and then for each new episode.   The entire game is buggy to the point where simply trying to play the game gets frustrating. If you progress though the story, try to do a simple dilevery quest, try to farm... I assure you you will find a bug that makes it unplayable. I can understand early release on games for a community that have waited a long time but ... is it to much to ask for the core game mechanics to be functional prior to 'release'?  Finally, the towns people... I know they have a secret... I understand it is part of the story (even if you can't get immersed in the story due to the aforementioned bugs which ruin it)... I can even accept that no one is ever where they are suppose to be (I'm talking to you store owners... 9-5 means 9-5 not 10 and only 10... maybe but fridays only... one day a month) but do the towns folk really have to treat the player like absolute garbage? You move in and they quite literally treat your existance there as a crime... it's a farming sim not a maximum security prison. I have to child proof my house because I am worried my little farming buddy might have some suicidal tendencies with all the from all the abuse. It will make it very hard to forgive them when... if they ever view you as a friend.   I can't play the game as it is right now... I will give it one more chance when it is complete but as of now nothing about this game is fun. Harvest Moon got it right just stick with them for now.",

            "review_text": "I gave this game a serious, honest shot. It does have an interesting story, and it really caught my attention, but to be honest, do not buy it. Let me list why:  1. Millions of bugs. This game is so full of bugs you would think they were a rotting corpse full of maggots. From NPCs walking through walls to text jumps to invisibile objects, even missing textures.  2. The game ends in the middle of Fall. Spoilers. You have two seasons to play, both of which are extremely boring. There is no building expansion, nothing to use building materials on, and nothing to buy other than more seeds. I spent the last 10 days in the episode sleeping, not even going outside. 3. Everything is glitchy. The main menu, the in game menus, the lag of the keyboard input and mouse input.  4. The developers act like they don't really care that they sold a half-♥♥♥♥♥ game. 'We will be focusing on episode 2'. How about you refund episode 1, fix the ♥♥♥♥ing thing, then worry about episode 2.  5. No use for ores, enjoy your base level tools until future episodes, at which point they will glitch into a giant dong and go straight into your ♥♥♥.  Seriously, do not waste your money. Get stardew valley, a game made a single person that is infinately better than this. Literally the only thing this game has going for it is the story arc. You'll even save a dollar by buying stardew.   I will not be buying any other games from this developer until they stop reading from EA's playbook.  UPDATE: I have since requested a steam refund on the basis of an incomplete game post 1.0 release and developers not supporting the unfinished product.",

            "review_text": "I'm not entirely certain this game even functions. Like, the jank evident in the trailers isn't just a bad framerate recording. The entire game seems to be full of that. It's a shame because it almost seems like they had the right goal in mind when it comes to paying homage to what was good about Harvest Moon, especially stuff like Friends of Mineral Town. They just did not execute, and I can only imagine this game is out of Early Access right now and placed into an episodic format because they needed to make sales to continue support of the game. I would have been perfectly content with a version that was only a proof-of-concept of competent farm upkeep gameplay, but something that doesn't even have that isn't keeping my interest with this weird theme of spooky VHS artifacts and the promise of a mystery behind the scenes.",

I do enjoy the dialogue and plot but the amount of glitches I have found in the game is very frustrating (i.e. not being able to buy feed unless you restart the game). If the game had cost less I wouldn't mind the glitches. I know it is cheaper than the real thing but it was still almost $20.",

I had a lot of high hopes for this game, but at this time it is disapointing and should look somewhere else to spend money for this catagory of game.",

The characters have interesting personalities--the dialogue is fresh (unlike what can be found in the Harvest Moon games that inspired it). While it DOES have some bugs (e.g. don't get paid for weeds or wood when you ship them), most of them do not detract from the overall appeal that this game has. Some say that an episodic approach is bad, and that is an opinion that I do not share. I say whatever floats the developers metaphorical boat. They have their reasons. o 3 o   p.s. ......the turnips are adorable. \\( ; A ; )/ &lt;3",

I will patiently waiting for new updates and new contents. I know and I can feel that you won't leave this game as it is, you have my full support! :)  So everyone stop giving negative comments, as I read once you purchase this game you won't need to buy any episodes, It will give you all episodes for free, so be patient what's important is that you love the game. Just wait patiently for the new updates will come soon. And just support the Developers because I know they're trying their best to make this game much better! And don't expect too much, as you can see the game is new what's important is that you only have to purchase it once and the rest you just need to wait for the updates. So stop giving bad reviews about this game, If you wanna see more improvements,just stop giving negitive comments, you're just stopping this game to become better.",

When I play the game now it doesn't feel that much different than it did 10 months ago. I understand there will be bugs and I'm not the type of person to complain about every little bug, but if Episode 1 is supposed to be finished I think most of the bugs should be fixed by now, it's been a long time to be honest. I do like the idea of this game though, I hope the devs can update with some new content sometime soon, but right now I can't reccomend it.",
