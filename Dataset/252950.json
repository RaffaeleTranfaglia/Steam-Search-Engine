            "review_text": "Rocket League is an excellent game and one of my favourites. It's very easy to understand but hard to master.  Optimisation is great, and graphics also is fantastic. The game also has full controller support, but you can play with mouse and keyboard as well, so it's up to you how you want to play. I more prefer the controller.  After the first launch of the game, you will hear a fantastic music on the menu. After that, you can choose your car. Play tutorial, and finally, you will be able to play your first game on multiplayer.  In the game, there are a lot of cars, and you can also buy paid DLC's. Cars from DLC's are technically the same. The only differences are hit boxes. According to developers, all of the cars have the same stats. Vehicles are customisable. For example, you can add an antenna, change your wheels, colour of the car, etc.  Like I wrote above Rocket League is very easy to understand because, in the main mode, the game consists of control the giant ball and try to score. To put it simply, it's just football with cars. You can choose between 1vs1, 2vs2, 3vs3, and 4vs4. The main modes are playable on casual and competitive types of the game. But there are also game modes which are more advanced like for example ice hockey, basketball and my personal favourite 'RUMBLE'. In 'RUMBLE' rules are the same, but here, every ten seconds the game draws for you one special ability. For example grappling hook, a tornado and a freezer weapon.  As I mentioned above, here are competitive matches. After ten games, you will get your rank. There are ranks like PROSPECT (I, II, III, Elite) CHALLENGER (I, II, III, Elite), RISING STAR, ALL-STAR, SUPERSTAR, CHAMPION.  The game rewards us in the form of points for all sorts of tricks, like aerials, bicycle hits, etcetera.   The Verdict Rocket League is a unique game with simple rules. If you haven't bought this game, do it. You will not regret. My final rating is 10/10.    If you found any mistakes, something isn't right, or you just don't like this review. Instead of giving me a thumbs down, tell me what is wrong. Thank you.",

Rocket League also features in depth customisation, allowing the user to ultimately customise their vehicle. This allows uniqueness, and a great ton of laughter.  Graphics of this game is amazing. If your computer isn't the best then you'll have to turn down the graphics a little, but your PC doesn't need to be expensive to play the game on great graphics. Decent laptops can even play this game decently.  This game is honestly a 9/10. Rocket League has the graphics, the dynamic energetic gameplay, the competitive experience in multiplayer and more.",

In this game you use a car to hit around a large ball into a goal, pretty much Soccer with cars.  It might be the best game I've played this year so far.  PRO : - Great gameplay. - Very competitive. - Matchmaking. - Easy to pick up and a hard way to master. - Marvelous graphics. - Tons of customization. - Cool DLC's. - Cross-platform. - Save replays after matches and edit them to your hearts content in the editor.   CON : - You can unlock a lot of things in such a small time.   Conclusion: Rocket League is an amazing game! I highly recommend it ~ 10/10",

            "review_text": "What I thought was the worst concept EVER (really? Football and Cars together? Come on.. anyone?) ended up being one of the most addictive games I’ve come to cross around.  PROS -Everyone is on the same page. There is no difference in XP, Cars, Skins or anything. SKILLS are everything -Very fluid -No bugs (at least I haven’t found one) -Multi-Platform -Coop and Local Coop  CONS -NO OFFLINE LAN. That kind of sucks… really. This would be a reason to NOT RECOMMEND a good game, but this game is pretty great, so I still give it a recommend (Oh yeah, I wan’t to hear those brats from US and EU talk about how everyone got internet now and we don’t need LAN Anymore, and this is a stupid complain.. please go ahead)  -Servers give a connection problem all the time. I asked a lot of people, and I am getting the same answer from at least 40% of the people. Maybe is just here in South America, and playing with servers outside the ping goes over 200. The good thing is that the game does not become totally unplayable, especially for new, not all that skilled players (like myself :D) -No the best Match Making system ever, but this is not a Con per say… just not so great yet I think  But really. Awesome game. Worth the full price. Tell your friends and Rocket!  ",

Amazingly fun game to play but even more fun, to me, is watching pros like Dirkend, Law, Tree, Kronovi, Gibbs, and sorry if I missed anyone that streamed beta/preview and actually has shown what are the game's possibilities. With that being said, I think and really hope that this game will become one of next E-sports big things, it certainly would be lots of fun for the audience.   I'll give it 10/10 for the game, rate a lot lower for community because people that are leaving games a lot, but hopefully that will get changed.  Definitely recommending it",

            "review_text": "Psyonix's magnum opus, Rocket League, is one of the most fun games I've had the joy to play. The master of fast-paced, addictive gameplay, the 5 minute matches keep you playing into the early hours of the morning and never failing to keep the action above 60mph! The vertical flexability that the openness of a Rocket League pitch offers is incredible, boasting a  Cirque de liberté  for you to perform all sorts of zany twists and turns in mid-air, it's remarkable to see glorious goals and superb saves made by some of the insanely talented players. One can better their Rocket League play naturally, by simply enjoying the game, however, the more difficult tricks like; airials, freestyles, dribbling and perfect positioning take some serious skill and precision and are a sight to see in competitive play. The game's perfectly playable with either a controller or mouse 'n' keyboard, so it's up to you to decide how you play. The customisation is great, fine-tuning your Rocket-Powered Battle-Car is fantastic and the options are near endless, offering plenty of choice. However, there is microtransactions. But, these are implemented in one of the best ways I've seen in any game, they're not intrusive or necessary for victory AT ALL, they're simply cosmetic. The free Rumble gamemode is serious fun and it's nice to see the devs frequently adding new features and stadiums to one of the most fun games of 2015. I don't care too much for either cars or football, but I adore Rocket League. Totally worth its full price and it's a steal on sale, highly recommended.",

Please buy it in or out of a sale :)  So, I was going to write a review at 100 hours but another 100 later and its... Been a few days... What can I say, the game is worth it at full price PLUS DLC (I have most DLC -- 3 are needed to 100% achievements). This game is very easy to pick up and there are tons of skills to master the game -- from dribbling to advanced aerials -- if you want to play it competitively or just improve. Plus there are tons more to come with Rocket Labs introduced and there is a basketball mode in the making as I write this review :)  ---------  Pros --     Great customization with base game and/or with DLC. You can customize paint, wheels, car body, the boost, hats etc!    Great common and uncommon drops    Gameplay is steady, you can easily play with keyboard and mouse or controller (I personally use an Xbox One controller)    Love the soundtrack     Achievements are easy but maybe a little bit of a grind for some     The UI is clean and well set out -- there is even a nice quick chat feature (Nice shot, Centering, Defending etc)    You can save replays to watch later or upload to youtube    It's so much fun to play alone in 1v1, matchmaking in 2v2/3v3/4v4 or with friends    Community is mostly friendly, you can now report... the rest...     The devs are great, they are constantly changing the game with a new ranked system and maps etc!     Great training modes and multiple levels of difficulty of AI to practice offline or before/in between a match   Well... You get the point with the pros...  Cons     Achievements and little content in the DLC does not feel worth it but forces you to buy if you want to 100% the game... DLC isn't needed so not a big deal. But hey... Batmobile DLC... GET IT!     I have had maybe 2 crashes and a few bad connections in my time, but it reconnects you to the match you were in so you don't lose XP    Conclusion... Buy the game. Its awesome. I've had a blast and there will be many more hours of fun to come! The game will only get better from here! Whoops... Nice shot! 10/10 &lt;3",

Rocket League truly is the easy to learn - hard to master game that the more you play the better you become  &gt;Rocket League is constantly watched by its developers who update the game periodically and always deliver new free and DLC content (All DLC for this game is only cosmetic which delivers a much better experience for those who want more and doesn't effect those who don't decide to pick up the DLC)  &gt;Rocket League provides a competitive and casual playlist for those who wish to either play for #1 on the leaderboards or jump into a few matches here and there   &gt;Unlike other sports games where you press a button to do an action, in Rocket League you actually have to learn moves and tricks. You control the direction of your car and how you play each and every match   CONS:  &gt;At times I find competitive matchmaking to be off to where you get matched with players way below your skill level and sometime players way above your skill level  &gt;Although Rocket League provides a fun and awesome experience, you don't get the full experience playing alone. I suggest picking up Rocket League with a couple of friends to make it more interesting   FINAL VERDICT:  If you do get the chance to pickup Rocket League with a few friends I suggest you do so. For 20 dollars you can't go wrong for the amount of hours you an your friends will pour into Rocket League",

I just don't like being on other people's time and sitting in lobbies. I'd rather play singleplayer these days. But Rocket League brought me back into the fold. You're rarely waiting on other people. You can drop in to most modes within seconds and games are merely five minutes of clock time and pauses for goals. Its simple, quick, doesn't waste your time. I enjoy that. Not to mention the game itself is fun fun fun! And there is a subpar singleplayer even.   I was indoctrinated with the standard 'soccer' modes of 3v3 but as I plateau'd and didn't develop into a competitive player I branched out into the less popular modes and matchups. There's plenty here to keep people of all skill levels, shapes, and sizes happy. E-Sports level competitiveness with the ability to join with your friends right down to what I'm doing casually bouncing into 2 or 3 'Rumble' matches with strangers when I got the time. Rocket League did something else for me too. The PC has a barren desert in the sports genre and this mildly and subtly fills the void a little more.  They're also consistently adding new free content and updates. All the while keeping paid DLC cosmetic. I could care less about all the knick-knacks as I don't even decorate my car but its got all that item customization people like. Wheels, paints, decals, toppers(hats), etc. They even added a crate system for those so inclined. Full price might be a little steep now that they do indeed have all these other avenues of revenue but that's what sales are for and I'd recommend waiting for one. Recommended!",

The game is easy to pickup and easy to learn but diffenetly something you should play with friends, the sheer joy of in fact lining up that perfect goal or getting it is a great feeling of something silly and stupid that will make you scream the ears of all your friends and wake up whoever else lives in the house.  This game is a perfect balance between silly, stupid and genius really, the music, the gameplay and the easy way of learning makes it sooo addictive that it is really just a must have for anyone who likes to have a great laugh with friends and just wanna forget everything else for a few hours.  I´m for sure gonna play this even more over the next long time as my car needs some swag ^_^  ",

Back when this game first came out I would 10/10 recommend this game. nobody really knew what they were doing and it was just as much of a party game as mario kart or gang beasts, etc etc. it was a blast and super hilarious... then people starting getting good. eh no biggy. we're still just as silly but now we actually see ourselves getting better. as time goes on the community gets more and more competitive. now its at a point where if you buy this game and you're playing it for the first time, you probably will just get frustrated that you are so bad compared to everyone else and corrupted by the mindset of the community. its about like csgo. but if you have the patience to fight through that and find the good people, go for it.  the next thing i want to address is the poorly designed ranking system. its OK, but could be A LOT better. now i don't want to complain but if you want your players to take your game seriously in a competitive scene, its only fair to them to give them a fair chance. so let's say you queue up for a match, and you're like lvl 20 ish level, rank prospect 2 in the new season. the problem is, the ranking match ups are all over the place. its like, win 4 matches in a row 'oh man you must be a god at this game, lemme just go ahead and match you against people 5 ranks above you' then you get your ♥♥♥ handed to you twice and you're back down to people 2 ranks less than you etc etc cycle goes on and on. and besides, you shouldn't even be getting matched against these people in the first place.   I was all-star level last season, i've played this game since launch and have had a ton of fun. but i have so many issues with this game as far as ranked and community goes. but the game itself is fine.   SO TL:DR... don't get this game unless A you're willing to work very hard to get good because god forbid you ever just play for fun, or B, you have good friends to have good times with in the game. i'm telling you, its toxic. don't go in there. also the AI is trash. k bye.",

It's a simple enough concept but executed almost perfectly and then honed and polished to a shine. It's the very idea of 'easy to learn, hard to master'. The controls are intuitive and the mechanics so straightforward that you'll grasp them within minutes. And yet it will probably take you hundreds of hours to master all the intricacies of its systems. While beginner level games take place mostly on the ground, high level play gains a whole other vertical dimension and pro games are a spectacle to behold. And the best thing: it's a fun experience all along the way!  Psyonix also made a couple of sound decisions during its development: cross-platform play guarantees a large playerbase for the years to come, unlocked, dropped and bought items (there is a 'key &amp; crate' system in place) are cosmetic in nature only (no stat boosting) and the DLC cars handle the same (except turn radius) as every other car in the game and only differ in their hitbox. The camera settings are also completely customizable (FOV up to 110) to accommodate a wide range of playstyles.  Be aware that due to the nature of the game, competitive game modes can be a salt mine of gigantic proportions. Fortunately enough, Psyonix provide different filter settings for voice and text chat to make sure this game can even be enjoyed by adolescents (and me).  Highly recommended!",

You could explain the mechanics; you play as a rocket powered RC car capable of jumping and flipping around the field, trying to score goals while flying acrobatically through the air... but that doesn't quite capture the pure excitement that Rocket League offers.  Not since Hawken have I experienced Overtime this intense and victories this satisfying and I honestly don't know why that is... but it is.  Negative points are few and far between but some may be: servers aren't quite capable of handling the thousands of people playing at once but the devs say they are working on it, and it has improved in the last few days. Another might be that the 'random' unlocks are for any car but the one you prefer to use but that's just PD2 'random' logic I'm already used too.  Overall, this game runs great; I get between 40 and 60+ fps on my upper-middle-class PC. It looks great even with all the AA's and motion blur turn on its not over the top.

Even if you're not typically a fan of sports games, like myself, or don't particularly like cars or racing, I still feel like there's a ton of enjoyment to be had with Rocket League. It's a game that is even more fun to play than it looks.  Every match creates an impressive sense of tension that makes each goal, assist, cross, clear or save feel extremely satisfying. The tight and responsive controls only add to this, as nearly every play or mistake simply comes down to your ability and timing. The controls are intuitive enough to pick up quickly but with an immense amount of depth. You can easily spend hundreds of hours honing your skills and still have room to improve. There's a huge skill cap and the gap between players can be extremely obvious. Thankfully, even the unranked matchmaking has MMR, so you generally always get matched against players of equal skill.  It looks as though things will only keep get better with the seasons and ranked divisions. There's currently ranked 1v1, team ranked 2v2, and solo ranked 3v3. They will be adding more in the near future including a team ranked 3v3 (Woo!). There's a lot of potential here for some amazing competitve gameplay and I can't wait to see it.  There's already a ton of stuff to unlock in-game as you level up; everything from new vehicles to a very large variety of ways to customize them, as well as some hidden secrets. You unlock things almost every game, so you always have something to look forward to. The devs want to support the game for years and will be adding more content to the game as time goes on. Some of it will be paid addons with new cars, ways to customize, etc., but every future map will be free to all.  TL;DR I can think of few better ways to spend $20 if you're looking for a really fun game that you can sink a ton of time into. This game makes me feel like a kid again, and I love it.

I have not fought the urge to get a good nights sleep to play a game in years. I am sure as time passes like most games the community will become toxic and unkind to players lacking the finesse or decision making to make a team excel, but at the moment this is one of the most refreshing and enjoyable gaming experiences in recent memory. I hope this encourages at least 1, but hopefully thousands of purchases of this gem.",

PROS  + Gameplay is very different from any other sports game, which in this case makes this probably the best sports game out there. (No hate on sports fans, I'm just a lazy ♥♥♥♥er sitting on his desk all day long) + Soundtrack is great + The car customization, it's really wide and you have a ton of options to choose from. (More coming ^^) + The game runs on my pc really well. Can play it on ultra with fps rarely dropping below 60. + Unreal engine + Game's price is spot on + DLC is worth buying if you're interested in having more customization options. Since the DLC is cosmetic only, it won't affect gameplay and thus is really well done.  CONS  - Can get a bit grindy for some (personally idc) - Community has become pretty toxic lately, but what would you expect from a competitive game anyways. (Huge thank you for the small heroes who aren't being toxic, I love you all!)  And to sum this review up, this game is 100% worth getting. I personally try to avoid becoming toxic myself, but sometimes it's unavoidable xD  Final verdict: 10/10 GOTY?: ♥♥♥♥ yea it is",

Easy to get into, but with enough depth to provide a lot to learn and a lot of fun playtime.

But when a game lets me pass the mark of 1,000 playing hours, I think it well deservers my first one.  Rocket League is a fascinating and exciting mixture of soccer, but with a special twist of not just being yet another simulation, but it introduced something else - flying cars. It is rather easy to start with, and in the beginning (and to be honest sometimes even now) you are happy when you hit the ball. Later on, when you've managed to advance through the game with your first goal (yeah!), your first aerial-goal (hell yeah!!) and nail-biting saves of balls that have crossed the line with 99% (holy s***!!!) you will realize: 'Hey, there are still guys out there that kick my a**!' and that there is still much to learn. But your effort and endurance will be rewarded with a fun, thrilling and competitive game, which will let you keep saying 'just 5 more minutes'...  But that's not all: Psyonix, the developer, is one of its kind. They do something, which is rare, maybe even extinct in the world of game developers and publishers: they listen to the community (crazy, right?)!  So here we are, a good year after the release of Rocket League and Psyonix has released several small (optional!) DLCs which primarily introduced new cars and they have released free updates which introduced new maps and play modes. After ice hockey and basketball which altered the map setting and/or the ball the newest addition 'Rumble' gave us a more fun oriented mode with all kinds of power-ups that will literally kick your and your opponents a**. These big additions were free, so if you want to, you can have an awesome game that'll entertain you for ages at a low-budget price. If you want to support this great bunch of people a bit more, you can buy the DLCs or some keys to the recently integrated crates. Both ways are not in any kind a 'pay2win' upgrade, but either just new cars or some stuff to pimp the visuals of your car.   So with Rocket League and its DLCs being on sale again right now, wait no longer, and buy this great piece of software - you will not regret it!",

Rocket League is one of those great ideas that may have found its way into little minigames embedded in larger games, but Psyonix finally decided to go ahead and make a full fledged experience dedicated to it. Essentially a soccer game where you drive a car to bump a giant soccer ball around, Rocket League has plenty of epic saves and amazing goals that keep you coming back for more. There is even a ranking system plus a competitive matchmaking mode for those who want to test their mettle against similarly skilled players.  Psyonix has also pledged to not introduce powerups or any changes to game balance, which is fantastic as all the cars handle the same essentially. I've heard rumors that some of the hitboxes and handling are slightly different between cars, but it is negligible at best. I've missed these kinds of games, where there are no silly 'perks' a la Call of Duty or car customization that can give you an edge in any way. It's just you, your car, and the ball. The new DLC cars are mostly novelties and haven't given an edge to any particular model of car, which is fantastic.  I've been following this game for quite some time so I bought it almost instantly when it was released. I highly recommend you pick it up if you're a fan of competitive sports games. Seeing as it's been top seller on steam for a couple weeks now, I'm sure this game will continue to have a healthy, active community for a long, long time.",

I was kinda amazed.  Now for the gameplay. This is a fast and tactical game, despite all the chaos that will happen on the field. The controls are simple and easy to get used to just after a few games, but very hard to master. The goal of the game is to score a goal by wrestling with a GINORMOUS ball while fighting with your opponents and trying to coordinate with your team.  The matches are fun and exciting, lasting from 6 to 10 minutes, depending on the amount of goals scored in the match. The customization is wild and rampart, with the cars having the same 'stats', except the minor hitbox changes.  There are several game-modes, and if you're familiar with the FIFA or Pro Evolution Soccer games, you will understand what they are. You have the Exhibition game mode where you play ONE match with your adjustable settings. You have the Season game mode consisting of multiple matches that follow a basic tournament format. And you have the Play Online mode (currently down on 7.7.15, the launch day) that has Unranked and Ranked game modes.  If you are a fan of fun, this is a game for you. ",

We can consider this game 'haxball in the third dimension'. That's because They two are the games which looks like easy while watching but after playing, you realise that you cant do what you think in.  There is not so many words to say about the game, since it has no story or something like that. To get used to play is crucial and I dont think that you dont need any skill when you play. You memorize the ball physics by training after a while. If you learn to set the kicking ball timing, the rest is about luckiness. There is something called aerial kick that I can't do well and think it is the only hard thing in this game. It might be de done by training and playing but somehow I cant.

Instead of a girlfriend at age 16, I had some 50 year-old chick who treated me as though I was having a sort of affair with her. Do you know what I mean? She definitely treated me as a 'bit of stuff' rather than as an equal. I mean, this was completely fine with me. I was doing this awesome hot chick, and moreover one who was unavailable to my peers. Man, I bet they wish they had the sort of sexual education I did!  After a while though, it started to grate, because she'd never take my opinions seriously, and that kinda rankled. Still I was 16, and she had, like, multiple degrees, so I counldn't blame her. Eventually, I moved away and we just sort of stopped seeing each other. I kind of wish we'd kept in touch and stuff, because there's been multiple times I could have used her wisdom and erudition. Still, all things must end, eh?  Anyway, ever since then, my life has been a pattern of affairs; I never really quite found the pursuit of single girls as fulfilling and rewarding as when you get some married broad to cheat on her husband through simply being a better man than him. Now, I kind of regret not settling down earlier, because I seem to have a lot of trust issues, always wondering when they'll end it and go back to their spouses. Still, it's better to regret something you did, than something you didn't, I guess.  So, anyway, and this is a bit of a sad end to the story, so sorry 'bout that. She died recently - I only noticed because of the obituaries in the paper - and it turns out she left something to me in her will. Well, not her will exactly, but the solicitor called me up to say there was an envelope with my name on it. It was dated only a few weeks after we broke up.  I'm not afraid to tell you I was kinda scared by this; my blood literally ran cold when I saw her ever familar script on the envelope. I was kinda shaking when I read it, and despite the fact it's kinda private (and a little bit sexy!) I kinda want to tell you guys what it said. It's important, and I think everyone should know.

Come on, where else can you dirve the Official Back to the Future Time-Machine Delorean, or the Bat-Mobile from Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice?  Since I bought this game, Psyonix has added Hockey and Hoops as online servers; and as of today (June 20) they're adding Neo Tokyo (and here I am with an addictive sweet-tooth for all things Japanese), along with another arena for Rocket Labs (which I thoroughly enjoy)! I've also purchased another copy of this game to give to a friend since getting this game.  I truly hope that Psyonix keeps releasing new content for this game, as it is the Only sports-style game I have ever enjoyed, and will ever play!  Oh!

It's riddled with afk's, people who abandon matches when they're losing, and over all just REALLY toxic people.

But my one friend had about 80 hours of play time and insisted that it was a great game. So did everyone else within the massive amount of positive reviews. Also, I hadn't played a car driving game in a while. With that said, I added it to my wishlist and the moment it went on sale I bought it.  Here I am now with over 100 hours of play time that FLEW by.  Beautiful clean graphics and game menus. Crystal clear audio with fun electronic songs when in menu. Playing with friends has always worked perfectly for me, whether online or split screen. Believe it or not I prefer playing with the keyboard, but the Xbox 360 controller works great, as does the PS4 controller. I love playing with friends but it's very fun going solo as well, and I don't say that often. Many 'hats' and 'antennas' to style your car with. Many paint types and colors to style your car with. A decent amount of cars to pick from. A decent amount of arenas and game modes to choose from, or create your own rules in your own arena and invite friends. If you don't have any friends the game's bots work well, although they are pretty easy even when set to their hardest difficulty. I'd equate the bots on 'All-Star' to a real player who is around 'Semi-Pro'. There is an exp point system and leveling up, but it doesn't do anything other than change the status displayed underneath your name such as 'Rookie, Semi-Pro, Pro, Veteran, Expert, Master, Legend' of which you can opt out of displaying. There are multiple camera options (can be very helpful) and graphics options. There are multiple servers in many regions, and you can toggle which regions to connect to. Also, the developers keep the game updated and release both free and purchasable content from time to time.  The game itself is soccer but with cars. Cars that can jump! And if you are good enough, cars that can even fly haha. There are boost pads that speed you up and you can use the boost to 'aerial' as well.   Cool side-note: This is the first game for PC that is cross-platform with both Xbox One and Playstation 4 players. If you are playing a match and notice someone's picture says 'PSY NET' that means that they are using a console.  Not much else to say other than try this game out for yourself!",

This isn't a 'oh 20XX only final destination' type thing, this is moreso like banning Hyrule Temple. -Network issues - you will hit the ball so many times and NOTHING will happen, you'll just pass through. Then there's the issue of seeing one thing and the other actually happening, such as you hitting the ball but on the server side you flipped too late or something. Very bogus. -Physics sometimes don't make sense - ball seemingly speeds up for no reason, car takes a very long time to fall but the ball seems to fall very fast (or sometimes very slow, really depends), hitting the ball below max boost can *sometimes* put it to full speed while others not, it seems very inconsistent -Not a lot of transparency from the devs - 'all cars are exactly the same....okay they have different hitboxes but other than that they're still completely the sa--...okay yeah they all have different turn radiuses but that's not a big deal cause everywhere else they're still the same.'  Choosing your car IS important, some need cars that pop it up easier, like the hotshot, and some want to keep it on the ground, like the merc. Except you probably shouldn't choose the merc if you can't powerslide properly yet as that has almost the worst turn radius in the game. Why they feel the need to hide this from the players is beyond me.  They also completely hide the matchmaking, having hidden MMR that pairs you up. Even though the matchmaking sucks. You either get dominated or you dominate. Hardly ever in between. Even though I was in bronze I was still getting matched up with gold players. Which is absolutely ridiculous.   I still recommend this game because if you play it for ten minutes here and there, it's really fun and if you wanna play a lot more, it's still really fun. But everytime I play I eventually stop because of frustration. Mostly because of the physics engine ♥♥♥♥ing up, like not transferring momentum properly.  Also, side note as this is not critical of the actual game, the community is VERY toxic. If you aren't good, everyone trash talks you, including your teammates. A lot of smurfing goes on and they are consistently ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, making fun of people that only have 30 hours in the game whereas they have 700. So yeah, be aware of that.",

Oh, really? Cool idea, but this cannot be fun.' If you are afraid wasting your money (It's often on sales, 3rd party sites, buying game for cs;go/tf2 keys), then trust me: YOU WILL NOT REGRET It's possible that you checked youtube videos for this game and have seen all those fancy aerials, sick dribbles and breathtaking freestyles. Well... Don't expect to be that good at the beginning. Don't be suprised when you have less than 15hrs... you will rather miss the ball on ground than touch it xD But... after spending more and more hours in this game you'll notice that you are slowly getting better and better. It's very satisfying. Just rly... When i was a pro (like 30-60hrs into the game [i dont remember how many hours it takes to get 20-29 lvl sry]) i did my first aerial goal and i was like: 'AHHHHHH!!! IM SO GUT FEELSGOODMAN' but then i checked some youtube videos and were like: 'Okay... FeelsBadMan'.  This game is easy to play and hard to master and gives a lot of fun (as long as you dont meet salty kid [Ignore him/ mute him]). Try it out :) 11/10.

            "review_text": "This game is made up of 3 ingredients: endorphin, adrenaline and salt.  Edit: Closing in on 600h, first review update. This is still my favorite game and it saves me a lot of money. ie. Game XXX go on sale, super hyped AAA game YYY launched next week with 10/10 review. And what goes through my head is, 'well, I can wait next sale or become cheaper, cause I will be playing Rocket League anyway.' I think besides VR games, I've only bought Alienation on PS4, but it is a loot grinding game, kinda of not what I expected from Housemarque. Right now I'm working on improving car controls and pretty much leveling up all aspects of mechanic, wall challenge, possession control, passing etc. There is less salt and adrenaline involved now, to me Rocket League now become a super fast pacing 'status analysis' game, you constantly evaluate situations, both enemy and team mates, you try to be consistent at what you do, but not too predictable facing enemy challenge. It's like a 4 or 6 players team smash game where everything and anything could happen in the stadium.  For newer player though, don't get frustrated or discouraged. No one play that good from day one. Just like any other game, there are some really talented guy that will 'get it' and be able to do whatever they like cause either they are young and brain adapt new things faster, or they have other games that trains their reflex/muscle so it's easier to transition to this game. Just aiming to 'have fun', all the efforts you make to improve your skill is to enjoy more fun when engage other players online. Yes, there will be trolls and toxic players, who cares? At 600 hours, I just laugh at those flaming/troll comments, it's just those few games in the thousands of matches. Bad player will exists if Rocket League is popular, cause everyone will face against someone better eventually, you could be matched with team mate less skilled than you do. And if everything isn't going your way, before venting/ranting on your team mates, think about 'having fun' and work on getting better while the more skillful player is present. You can only improve playing with people that are better than you, observe and think what you are missing from replays, and practice, practice, practice even more until you can also do those ♥♥♥♥ they do without thinking or brain go blank. :)",

But whatever you do, DON'T MISS A SHOT. You will be hated on until you want to uninstall.  If you score a goal, hope you don't have that one guy who spams 'What A Save' after every goal. You will get hate.  MidField:  Most People don't even know that this is a position. You're job is to keep the ball from going too far back.  You want to try and set up your Strikers for goals. Unfortunately, the second you miss an Ariel or any hit, you're going to get hate. But it feels so good when you hit an Ariel. So keep calm and waste that boost.  Goalie/Keeper: This is probably the most important positions in the game. You're job is to keep the ball out of your net and to clear it up to your midfielders. But be warned, the opponents, and sometimes your own team, will constantly run into you and get in your way. Missing a Save results in a goal and your opponents getting real mad at you.  Oh, and don't be that guy who gets the best spawn and stays back. Just don't.   Well, that's it.  My review on Rocket League. Hopefully this boosts your interest in the game. -Frost.",

For the ranked games, you start of with 10 games as unranked, before you achieve a rank in the lowest (prospect) division. For me this game has given very good value for the money, and I recommend it strongly.",

I gave it a shot, played it with a friend got my ♥♥♥ stomped for  about 20 hours. Told my friends about it, everyone bought it. We do 2,3,4's nightly and even when we get stomped we look forward to the next match for redemption.  The fact that AAA devs cannot make a game like this says a lot. There is a lot of over thinking in todays gaming culture, buzzwords, hype culture. All that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t none of them is necessary for Rocket League. Its soccer cars. They have a league  system that is is fun to climb and easy to fall out of. The game feels like the right amount of easy to pick up and play yet incredibly hard to master. This is what keeps my friends and I coming back night after night. To yell at eachother and  shout like idiots when we pull off some amazing move we have never done before.  Its teamwork. Simple team work and my god is it rewarding. For 30 bucks? This game is a steal and a half. I bought all the DLC which is all cosmetic becuse the base game was so god damn good I had to suppor the developers further. That says to me that they have made something special in a market cluttered by cookie cutter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and everyones charging full ♥♥♥♥ing price.   The problems with the game are minor but need to be addressed. I play on the mouse and keyboard (yes I am ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) and the input delay/negation of the right mouse button commands (which effect jumping) are awful. I thought it was my mouse dying at first. So I bought a new mouse, same thing happened looked on the forums. Its a known game issue. If you are using a controller  you will be fine though. Next problem, pings and matchmaking. Pings seem a bit irratic even being on the same region but that is to be expected I suppose. Matchmaking seems off as we can have a fantastic match in game 1, then in games 2-4 we get rickrolled completely. Little things that need to be fine tuned and everythings fine. So no major complaints.   If you have buddies you like to game with, and want a simple yet challenging game pick this sucker up. You owe it to yourselves.   Rocket League gets 9 out of 10 from me in every regard. Nearly the perfect game overall and the best Indie game I have ever played.   GO BUY IT",

If you like soccer(football) or cars that you can do tricks with, this game is for you. You can play 1v1, 2v2, 3v3 or 4v4, with or without your friends, non-ranked or ranked.  Customizing your cars is easy and fun. You can have different colors and designs stenciled on your cars, as well as different decorative flags and hats, yes hats, for your cars. When you use 'boost' in game, you can even apply different exhaust smoke/ribbon that shoot out of your car. You can have normal smoke, stars, money, rainbow ribbon, flowers or even have snow coming out.   Game time is 5 minutes per match.  Good sized maps and it is easy to learn but it is very hard to master, you can for example 'fly' with your car and you can also drive on the walls. Driving on the walls and or using the boost to fly takes practice to do so effectivly. Don't expect to be the best player in one hour, like with other games. This game really brings out the competitive side in me and I bet it will bring it out in you too.  I can safetly say that I have not started to be burnt out by this game. Most games only keep your attention and the feel of 'Oh, I really want to continue to play this' for so long. When I wake up in the morning I feel like I need to play this game.  I'd say if you're a competitive gamer that likes something easy to get into but takes time to shine like a pro, this is the game for you.",

            "review_text": "Have you ever wanted to play a sport AND drive a car? You've probably answered yes, but now I ask you: 'Have you ever wanted to do both of those at the same time?' Assuming you've never played the prequel 'Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars!' you probably think that I'm crazy for even asking such a question.   The concept of the game is quite simple: use your battle-car to hit the ball around a field and try to score goals. In fact, the concept is so simple that I imagine several big developers *cough*EA*cough* are slapping themselves over not having come up with the game first. With that being said, the game itself can be very complex with many of the strategic choices being reminiscent of actual sports - except with rockets... and not having to be outside - which on its own provides enough depth that the game borders on casual/hardcore fun.   Many of the unlockables are nice to look at and allow the player to customise their own little car into something that passes for a personality statement. The customisation itself, unfortunately, is limited in that you can only have one topper equipped at a time which leaves the siren + fire helmet combination hanging in the wind.   Graphically the game is pleasing to look at and each of the cars are distinct which adds to the clarity during what can often be chaotic matches. The different fields have their own styles as well as several variations which add interesting little events to the outside.  The music seems to only play during the menu but the developers have been kind enough to provide the official soundtrack for only USD$4.99, so that you can enjoy the music while you're in the game. This is of course a hint to the developers to provide an option to have the music play during matches.   The sounds are fairly good and you will hear various crowd reactions to different things happening in the game which is definitely a nice touch.  The game can be played with either mouse/keyboard or a controller. However, out of the two the controller is heavily recommended since the game adds itself to the 'play this while sitting in a comfortable chair at some distance to your screen' school of thought. Although, if you find yourself without a controller the mouse/keyboard will do just fine.   Overall, I highly recommend this game to anyone who is looking for something to pass the time and looking for something simple yet highly addictive.",

There really is no reason to not own this game, especially with its low cost.  Maybe you're one of the people who look at this game and think 'Looks fun, but it's just so SILLY, there's no way I'd get THAT into it!' Those were the words of my friend who I had to convince to get the game, and he now has over 500 hours invested into it. Seriously, if you think you MIGHT like it, you will.  On top of how amazing the base game is, they also keep adding more to keep it fresh. New fields (mostly standard, but we're starting to see crazy fields), gamemodes (we saw crazy mutators, ice hockey, and rocket labs, with basketball coming out next week), and DLC. The way that their DLC works is great. Never will you miss out on a field or gamemode because you don't have DLC; DLC is purely for cosmetic car changes. The DLC's are also always very fairly priced, bringing awesome looking cosmetic choices for only a couple of dollars.  Do I have any gripes about the game? Sure, they just don't come close to outweighing the positives. The community can be quite toxic, leaving in the middle of matches and insulting other players, but that's not out of the ordinary for competitive online games. Psyonix also perhaps didn't listen to the community closely enough, especially regarding Wasteland. A LOT of players hate the field, and really didn't want it in ranked, and yet it seemed to become the most common field to play on in ranked, and stayed that way for a long time. They did, however, recently update the physics in a way that will likely cause less hatred of the field.  As one final note, you DO need a controller for this game. There are PC controls, but very few players can do much with those controls beyond the basics. A wired XBox 360 controller has worked perfectly for me. Get this game, use a controller, and have a blast.",

Quarter, core, peel and slice the apples about 5mm thick and lay evenly on the baking sheet. Put paper towels on top and set aside while you make and chill the pastry. For the pastry, beat the butter and sugar in a large bowl until just mixed. Break in a whole egg and a yolk (keep the white for glazing later). Beat together for just under 1 min – it will look a bit like scrambled egg. Now work in the flour with a wooden spoon, a third at a time, until it’s beginning to clump up, then finish gathering it together with your hands. Gently work the dough into a ball, wrap in cling film, and chill for 45 mins. Now mix the 140g/5oz sugar, the cinnamon and flour for the filling in a bowl that is large enough to take the apples later. After the pastry has chilled, heat the oven to 190C/fan 170C/gas 5. Lightly beat the egg white with a fork. Cut off a third of the pastry and keep it wrapped while you roll out the rest, and use this to line a pie tin – 20-22cm round and 4cm deep – leaving a slight overhang. Roll the remaining third to a circle about 28cm in diameter. Pat the apples dry with kitchen paper, and tip them into the bowl with the cinnamon-sugar mix. Give a quick mix with your hands and immediately pile high into the pastry-lined tin. Brush a little water around the pastry rim and lay the pastry lid over the apples pressing the edges together to seal. Trim the edge with a sharp knife and make 5 little slashes on top of the lid for the steam to escape. (Can be frozen at this stage.) Brush it all with the egg white and sprinkle with caster sugar. Bake for 40-45 mins, until golden, then remove and let it sit for 5-10 mins. Sprinkle with more sugar and serve while still warm from the oven with softly whipped cream.

It is also replayable, and I like games that are replayable rather than one time purchases that you'll only play for ten or so hours.  It is different from most games, to say the least. No complex purchasing system or overpowered football players in rare card packs, whether you win or lose a game depends on your skill and the strategy you and your fellow cars play out. Playing with friends is recommended, as you can rotate in positions such as attacking or defending.  The customisation is great, and quite possibly my favourite. As you complete games, you unlock new items. Some are rarer than others, but the common items are great too. There are some cool items I've unlocked, such as Deadmau5. The cars are good too. Some are suited for different purposes, but I always find myself using the DLC cars from the Supersonic pack. Dominus is my personal favourite, alongside the Takumi. What I am impressed by is not just the system and the cool items, but the wide variation of customisation. Colours, decals, antennas, wheels, even boost types, this game has it. I like the nods to other games such as Portal, too. My favourite feature so far is that this game is not purchase heavy. No cases or boxes that require keys you buy from the marketplace to open. You get items, and nothing else is required. I'm so happy the system works like this.   The community can be okay sometimes, but I've come across some toxic games. Disabling the chat helps, but I can't play a competitive 1v1 match without someone leaving when I'm clearly going to win. Yeah, still a win, but it kills the fun of the match. Maybe a sanctioning system for leaving competitive games could fix this, such as a time out?  The visuals are stunning. In my opinion, they are better than any other game I have played, rivalling with Rise of Tomb Raider. I didn't expect the visuals to be so stunning, but when I saw the incredible detail of the main menu alone, I knew that this was going to be a beautiful game.  Overall, it's outstanding. In fact, I see it being a top favourite. Seeking as I've played other games for much longer than 15 hours, this game has met my expectations and beyond. Maybe I'm overhyping this a little bit, but for someone who is a fan of competitive games like this, it's epic in my eyes. A purchase that if you consider, you won't regret.",

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

I never thought combining football and RC cars would ever in my wildest dreams be a successful idea but Psyonix pulls it off with vigor. Rocket League is insanely easy to pick up and play and even easier to play with friends, but learning game-winning strategy and pulling off impossible tricks will take all of your time to learn. It's one of the best games to load into quickly after a long day and pop in for a match or thirty. Rocket League is some of the best arcade-style, true-to-form 'video game' fun you'll ever have.",

In-depth review: This game is really addicting and cool. The graphics are good. The idea of the game may sound boring (football/soccer with cars), but when you start playing the game, you think how the developers came up with this amazing game. There are a ton of cosmetic items (more than 200 collectible items), which allow you to make your ride really unique (I'm 99% sure that you will never find the same car as yours, unless its your friend). I think the developers did a great job on the cosmetic items. The best aspect of the game is that it's not pay to win (buying stuff will not give you an advantage over other players). Now I want to talk about the community. The players you will meet will be either very kind (about 70% of them), or really mean (about 30% of them). The kind players will say compliments to you everytime you make a goal, assist, save, etc..., but the mean players will either say that they're better than you (even if your'e winning) or ragequit (which is actually good for you xD). The game gets old after half a year (my opinion), but I find myself playing the game after 1 month of a break. If you have a real life friend who plays this game too (I don't), then Rocket League is really, really fun. But of course, you can always play it with a friend, which you met on this game and it is still really fun to play. I want to mention, that if you saw those epic clips on YouTube, where people do 360 backflip-kickflip-somersault aeriel shots, you will probably need more than 250 hours of playing (I have 190 hours in total and I barely make aerials). Anyways, if you like addicting, fun, arcady games, this game should be perfect for you.   Hope you enjoyed my review :).",

Then your next match is vs Veteran or Expert and you lose (offcourse i'll get to this later) 7 points. It will take you ages to ♥♥♥♥ing progress.  I'm level 26 and i'm just a decent player but when I join ranked with 230 points or something similar in 3v3 I get put up with 2 veterans and 1 expert when my teammates are 2 pro's and 1 veteran. How is that fair? Obviously it's 'fair' because we have the same MMR but they have atleast 30+ gametime more than us so they are just better. Why is matchmaking giving us these impossible games IN RANKED. How are we supposed to progress?  -EDIT- 20 Oct, 2016  joined ranked game 3v3, opponents has over 9000 ping, gets disconnected from game server, matchmaking ban for 15 minutes. gg 10/10 would match make again",

The game is well balanced giving no one the advantage at any time, except for the players in the arena. This is totally worth the 20 dollars to spend and can run on a low GPU computer. (I have Intel 4600 HD) If you are debating on buying this game, this review should be your influence to go ahead and buy the game, because this is one of the most fun games I have ever played. I may have little amount of time played but nothing compares to cars that fly and play football.",

The game will look simple at first, i mean just run into the ball with your car and score. Right? Wrong, there are no limits on what you can to like aerials, dribbling, freestyling, etc. When you get the hang of these things the game just gets more fun and intense. There are new maps and dlc released every few months and the developers have done a good job keeping the game well optimized and balanced. Overall, whether you play this game casually or competatively, you will enjoy playing it.",

Team colours are are reduced for pratical sake, but secondary paint colours are enough to fill any belly. Yes yes Black aswel. After playing this long enough black wont be enough.  Most DLC has extra cars with them, these cars usually have new paint jobs for just them. So dont expect Flames to be for every car.  Parts: Car, Paint colours, Hats, radio Antenna ends, Wheels, Rocket Stream. Each part is unlocked as you play, usually one per match. sometimes there'll be even only items, for example Halloween had some bits you will only see from players who played at that time.

As my skills have improved, I've found that the game can be a lot more fun at times, than when I had first started off. I say 'at times' only because it can also be very frustrating, being paired relatively often with people that are much better than I am. I don't want to say that the ranked system isn't good, but it can still use a little more work. That is NOT to say, however, that about 70-80% of the time it works out well, pairing me up with others at my own skill level.  One thing I don't really care for though is the recent addition of crates and microtransactions. I really wish that you could just earn the keys to unlock crates, even if they were very rare, while still having the option to buy keys if people so desire. But the fact that you can  only  buy keys is disappointing. I understand full well that the game states the profits mostly go to hosting championships, but I highly doubt they are pressed for money given the success of the game.   Either way, despite a couple negatives I have mentioned, the gameplay is still a blast, and the developers continue to add free arenas and gamemodes, which is awesome. There's definitely a reason I have over 400 hours invested into this game.  'Just five more minutes...'",

One of the problems I've particularly encountered is what I can best describe as 'multiboxing' as in World of Warcraft where one player controls more than one character simultaneously.

It makes it great for both the casual and hardcore players.

The game is constantly full of players ranigng from matches of '2 vs 2' to '4 vs 4', you are constantly in communication with your friends, would not recommend to play with randoms as the communication between players maybe difficult, and sometimes they just wont listen to you.  The game currently looks beautiful and stunning to look at, the weather in the game like rain for example does make the game give that feel of a match, rain just makes the match look so much better.  There isn't a lot of models for the vehicles currently, most likely they will bring out more, possibly to pay, nothing is Pay-To-Win in this game, as everyone has the exact same stats and boosts, there are a couple of skins you can place on your vehicle for some customization, decide on the look of your tires, and country flags (Finally, another game that shows the Welsh flag), there are currently not a lot of these customizations, but I would highly think they will add more.

Semi-Pro : You will hit the ball once per while, and you will make that little smile in your heart while you at it. You crave for that ' Nice Shot! ' or ' What A Save!' but still you cant do it   Pro : Well... you not really a pro yet but a better person and skill than Semi-Pro. You can aim the ball towards you want but maybe 45 degrees or maybe 90 degrees where you aim it. Still, nice try. You will try aerial or flying your car several times even its gonna be too high  Veteran : Welcome to the world of basic aerial! Your ground work much better now ,your aerial become useful for the team , but sometime burden. you can basicly dribble the ball towards the goal. You can Save the ball easier now because you know where it headed.Still you cant save f**ing Expert Shooting from aerial in not reasonable place to shot.(This is where i am right now)   Expert :You're that f**ing Expert Shooting from aerial in not reasonable place to shot. Because when you see the ball in the air you gonna start flying and actually HIT the the ball where nobody cant reach it,you missed the ball several times but your team or your enemy WILL not care because they know You.Are.Pro. Also you can hit Wall Aerials which is SO HARD TO DO.  Master : I Met them, a lot. i can tell you one thing about Masters. YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE. Passing , shooting , basic aerial , dribbling , wall shot they can do it no sweat. If you a master now , well you can smile a bit because We are scared of you and if we got you in our team. 'OMG'  Legend: I only met legend twice , My god you will not understand the physics you learn in Highshool. WHAT THE FU** WITH THAT AIR DRIBBLE? Trust me if you see what i saw , ur ded.Also shooting and dribbling = Messi. SO ACCURATE.  Rocketeer : Funny i met Rocketeer in matchmaking 3-4 times , more than a legend. They have all the Legend traits but they got one that no one have. A COMPLETE PLAYER TRAIT. If this guy play defense. That f**ing Expert Shooting from aerial in not reasonable place to shot is gonna be blocked. If this guy play strike well you need another Rocketeer or maybe Veteran Legends to match up, or maybe a good teamwork can save you. THE BALL WILL RARELY TOUCH THE GROUND. They even intentionally pass the ball to the air and then another rocketeer intentionally BACKFLIP HIT IT TOWARDS THE GOAL. More than a worst nightmare. Its your grave  Well that's all i can tell about Rocket League Classes from my experience. if somone disagree like ' Im a rookie but i can hit aerials!' feel free to write comments  Anyway , Greatest.Multiplayer.Ever with great community (you wont meet 'Your momma' jokes here') with a lot great tutorial in youtube that you can learn from.AND THIS AWESOME CARS  11/10",

But 60 is just swell) • Supports In-game voice/text chat • Low ping (Make sure to select your region in the server filters) • Clean Interface  • Smooth Gameplay  • Customizable cars (You can even give them hats!) • In-game replay recorder (Just hit 'save replay' after any match) • Incredible visuals  • Controller support (The game suggests to use a controller, but honestly, the keyboard works perfectly. All preference)  Game Cons • Slight lag after letting go of the VoIP button (F) • No punishment for players abandoning a match • Reports of crashing/freezing while watching replays  • Has the chance of crashing/losing connection after a round if you're in a group and not the party leader  Relateable Games • Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Power Battle-Cars  Conclusion Rocket League is an amazing game. You know those games that you play while you should be going to bed? That's this game. Only 90 minutes into the game, and i've already had so much fun with it. I would honestly reccomend this game to anyone. Unless you REALLY hate soccer, and you simultaneously REALLY hate cars.  (If you found this review helpful, consider giving it a thumbs up!)",

Nice graphics and art style.      Great performance with me having everything maxed 1440p without fps dips below 60.     Several game types both ranked (with a fun and rewarding ranking system) and unranked.     Good level of car customisation.      Some nice cosmetic loot based progression for the first 20 hours.     Fairly priced DLC that gives no ingame advantage being purely cosmetic.     Splitscreen on PC! ♥♥♥♥ing awesome feature I wish more games had.     Cross-platform; get ready to rekt some PlaySation noobs :)     Good support for both controller as well as keyboard and mouse.      Reasonably friendly community (there are definitely some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s though) with a large player base meaning you will always find games quickly.   Cons:     Some game modes such as 4v4 I find too chaotic and less enjoyable.     Bots are dumb and easy to play agaisnt; not much use for trying to improve on except for beginner players.     Single player is a nice addition but lacks behind other car games campaign modes and isnt as enjoyable as the multiplayer.     No support for higher resolutions such as 1440p and 4k in the menus by default (although you can easily fix this by going into the games file and manually changing the resoltution without any issues.).     Rare server issues that make collision detection a ♥♥♥♥♥.

The review in short:  Pros: - It's fun racing and trying to score; - It has active developers; - New updates (like cars, maps and gamemodes) released every now and then; - Not paid-to-win.  Cons: None.   Long review:  When this game was first released, I purchased it before the hypetrain took Rocket League to the next level. Back then, it only had the standard gamemode and a number of cars. The developers quickly released some patches for bugs that needed fixing, but it was a very well made game upon release.  The DLCs released by Psyonix are definitely worth their money if you're interested in new car models, wheels, boost designs, etc. No DLC is paid-to-win, and microtransactions have only been introduced recently: crates and keys containing more visual items, there are no paid-to-win items at all, so that's a big plus.  As for the gamemodes, it started with a pretty simple arena and you just had to score. Soon after they released the hockey gamemode, where the ball was turned into a puck which actually behaved like one. After that they released the hoops gamemode, which is similar to basketball. You have hoops which are elevated, and you score by making the ball go through the hoop from above (it doesn't work from below, I've tried).   Just recently they released the rumble gamemode, in this gamemode you play in a random arena (from the default gamemode) and you get random powerups every 10 seconds. To get a new powerup, you have to use your current one and wait for 10 seconds. Powerups can include teleportation (you vs. an opposing player), force boost on an opposing player, a magnet which attracts the ball towards you from a certain, short, distance and a lot more. It's quite fun and refreshing.  Other than the abovelisted gamemodes, you have regular and ranked gameplay. Both try to match you with players of your skill level as best as they can, and they quite often do a good job of doing so.   This game is definitely recommended, because at first I did not think I would be playing this game as much as I do.",

The soundtrack is amazing, I've found new tracks to listen to in and out of this game.  The only real con to this game is that you can't run a Season with your friends online! Instead, we have to draw up our own tree and have at it from there, which isn't too bad since it's the same thing, but it would be nice if it was in the game itself!

Games last ~5 minutes, making it great for both casual and competitive gamers. Being both amazing and addictive, I highly recommend it.  Edited after extensive amounts of competitive gameplay ranging from All-Star to Challenger Elite solo 3s que so solo players can have an idea of what to expect.  Prospect rankings: -Players have little or no knowledge of field spacing. More often than not, the entire team will clump on the ball.   -Players exercise little to no field awareness. Plan on teammates bumping you off the ball or hitting the ball just to hit it, rather than letting a teammate with a better angle clear or progress the ball  -Whiffing. It's a whiff fest. Don't plan on players always making connection with the ball.  -Rare aerials. Most game play will be on the ground  -Tip off roles. Players will most likely all rush the ball on tip off  -Empty goals. Players will rarely play goalie or rotate field position. Most often when there is a goalie, it's a dedicated player who is passive more often than not. Many trash goals and long range goals happen, as you can shoot from almost anywhere on the field with 3 playing forward.  -Players only play the ball, directly to the goal the majority of the time with minimal usage of the corners/walls. You really don't have to worry about players blocking angles with their car or demolishing other cars idling on the field. You really don't have to worry about too many players at this level anticipating the angles of the ball, whether it's leaving a car or a wall.  -Players are generally uncomfortable playing backwards and change direction awkwardly.  -Spatial skills. You don't really have to worry about people using the ball cam and exercising solid mental mapping of ball and player positions.  Challenger Rankings: -Hit or miss on player spacing up until Division 4+. Players often clump to the ball and leave gaps in the field.  -Players exercise *some* field awareness up until Division 4. Teammates will often bump other teammates off the ball or hit the ball just to hit it, rather than let the teammate with the better angle take the touch. Players will most likely have an understanding of position/role rotation at this point.  -Whiffing. Doesn't happen nearly as much once you're in Challenger division, and more often than not it results in an opportunity for a goal.  -Aerials. Expect players to fly.  -Tip off roles. Players generally know their role at tip off. Forward/side challenges on tip off, one plays mid for the second touch, one generally plays goal. It's hit or miss on if the goalie goes to the corner to grab the full boost, often resulting in trash tip off goals. It's been my experience that the stronger goalies collect the boosts within the goal box.  -Empty goals. Players still tend to over extend from time to time, leaving empty goals. Furthest one back should hover half field and look for cleanups on centers or to play the ball forward when it is pushed towards them. Count on there being a goalie or someone near goal, however. You will find that many of the goalies do not challenge tackles, the success of a passive goalie isn't consistent. Players are more creative with shooting at this level.  -Players no longer only play the ball. Plan on being demolished for idling under a ball while it falls to the ground or while playing a passive goalie. Plan on players anticipating the angle of the ball leaving a wall or car. They no longer play directly to the goal, especially if the box is loaded. Anticipate high balls off the wall for centers, as well as players playing on the walls and flipping it to mid/goal with a well timed jump.  -Players are comfortable playing both backwards and forwards. Spin someone out? Plan on them seamlessly transitioning to reverse/forward. Demolishing them completely is your best bet.  -Spatial skills. It's been my experience that good players use the ball cam. Plan on them having a solid mental map of ball position, car positions, and field position.   -Speed boosts. Players will now be strategically pathing through boosts. Rarely will they strategically steal the other team's boosts in front of the goal while applying pressure on the goal.  Challenger Elite+  -Expect anything. From players demolishing idle cars to strategically removing boosts from the field, it's gonna happen. Passive goalies are generally a thing of the past here. Expect any lead touches to be challenged.  -Players understand position, roles, and are skilled when it comes to spatial skills and anticipation.   -Whiffing *rarely* happens and most likely results in a shot on goal. Anticipate connection on every challenge.  -Control. Once at this level, players have an initimate understanding of how to use their car. Plan for them to play the most advantageous angle when it comes to near/far post on shooting. Crossing/center can happen from almost anywhere, whether it be from a high spot on the wall or from a defending goalie box.  While this isn't everything, I hope it gives players an idea of what to expect.   This is a great game!",

From aerials to dribbles, practice makes perfect, and to play this game, you need to commit to it, as this incredibly dynamic game, requires precision, and carefull analasis of the situation. Saying that, getting started is easy, and especially if you do all the trainings daily, as part of a routine.  The look of cars in the game is hugely expandable, from making the flash, to a fancy taxi, the possabilities are endless, and the DLC's are worth while, as they add a whole new look upon the game, with new decals, paint jobs, wheels and boosts, your possibilites will be hugely expandable. I also love the fact that you do not have to pay, to get a beautiful car, the default cars, paint jobs and boosts etc. are very good, as well as the new robust trade up system, get very rare items within the matter of hours of effort.  The one DOWNSIDE of the game, are season restarts, as they cause alot of good players to drop into very low ranks, and ruin the experiance, however a few weeks after the Neo Tokyo update, which also restarted the ranking system in matchmaking, everything was back to normal.  - WH0",

It is even fun for people who don't like soccer. It is fun to play alone, but is even more fun if you play it with friends. Sometimes you all will be rolling on the floor laughing of things that happend during the game.  There is a great selection of free cars where you can choose from, with special livery's for each of these cars. They really created a good solid base of the game with great range of cars/hats/rims and other things you can add on your car. Ofcourse like any other game you can buy DLC's. These DLC's will give you extra cars and some other things for a reasonable price. Great thing is, you don't need to buy any of the DLC's to be better or to gain an advantage.

The playing field seems to be solely separated by how well a person can navigate their vehicle; all vehicles have the same capabilities, it's your responsibility to learn the controls, tolerances, and mechanics. Vehicles don't level up and become faster or more agile to give the player an advantage, only the player can improve themselves by learning the mechanics and the physics.  The mechanics are fairly simple and there is a tutorial and a free-roam area for you to get accustomed to how the game works and controls. When you're ready to play online, you can choose the level of people you wish to play with or you can customize a search to match you with available games. Player levels are based solely on how many points a player has scored by making goals, defending, or performing a number of other actions.  I really like that games are fairly quick (there's a timer) and I can typically just jump in for a couple games, have some fun, and then drop it. There's no commitment to leveling stuff to gain advantages, it's just good, quick fun.  I'm running the game on an i7-940 with a GTX 970 and I'm running the game at 120Hz (check PC Gaming Wiki to unlock framerate) and I've not had any issues; I'm also using a 360 gamepad and it has worked great for this.",

It's soccer with cars. There's not a whole lot to go over in a review. It might sound like a silly concept on the surface but a great physics engine, tight controls, and smooth gameplay elevate a simple idea to something really special. When you get your hands on it you can immediately feel just how well it plays. It's easy for anybody to pick up and play and yet challenging to master.   Besides the game itself, the only other real feature is that you can customize your car from a good selection of different bodies, accessories, paints, and patterns. There's quite a lot of variety so it's pretty easy to make your car stand out with all the different combinations at your disposal.  Only thing I think this game is missing is a replay history ala Halo. You *can* save replays, but if you accidentally forget to press the button in the post-game lobby there's no way to get it again. A constant history of 5-10 games that you could look back at and save the replays of would be a welcome feature.",

A new twist on soccer (I'm american) that's surprisingly fun  Pros-------  - Lots of customization - Great gameplay - Online multiplayer which rarely has lag - Server host locations for a wide variety of regions - Cross platform gameplay between PC and PS4 - No car is game breaking. They all perform the same. So the DLC cars are not pay to win, just more decoration options. - Don't need a controller to play, keyboard controls are great, I suggest remapping a few though - Nice selection of team sizes ranging from 1 vs 1 - 4 vs 4 - Ranked gameplay for all you competitive players out there  Cons------  - Can't make cross-platform parties - 4 vs 4 can get laggy  I personally love the game and may be a tad biased in favor of it. It's a game you can put hundreds, if not thousands of hours into and not get bored of. I suggest playing with friends as it can make your experience more enjoyable.  tl;dr I reccomend buying and the DLC has some pretty nice looking stuff for the price, so get that too if you like the game as much as me and have a bit of extra money.",

There are a variety of cars to choose from which all behave the same for the most part (there are slight differences in the hitboxes and turn radii afaik) and you can also customize these cars with paint schemes, skins, hats, wheels, and antennas (these do not change car performance). You can choose to play 1v1 up to 4v4 either casually or competitively with a rankings ladder and all of the maps look great but have the same layout (devs have mentioned adding more unusual layouts in the future). I was on the fence about this game for a month or so after release but I am kicking myself for not picking this up earlier. I have played 104 hours and the game hasn't become stale. Rocket League is pure, unadulterated fun.   P.S. As of this writing, there are 3 DLC packs available at reasonable prices that add nothing but new vehicles and cosmetic options.",

Its so ridiculously simple in gameplay, but that's the very thing that makes it so great.   There is something over 150 customization options for the 10(?) currently available cars, with surely more to come in the future.   There arent a vast amount of maps available right now, but there is talk of much free DLC coming in the future including new Stadiums to play in which is amazing to hear.  This is a game that benefits highly from playing with friends, because so far every game Ive played with other people has been some of the best fun Ive had in a multiplayer game in a long time. If you aren't planning on playing with friends the majority of the time, you might find the game gets a little repetetive and stale. However it makes for a great party game as it comes available with up to 4 player split screen.  The only cons I can give at this time (July 18th, 2015) are that it has had a few server issues the past week or so, but that is primarily due to the large increase in players due to its popularity, this shouldnt be a problem for much longer, if it even is anymore. The last thing I can think of is that the game has a weird habit of Crashing randomly during different times in gameplay. The last few times its happened prior to the startup of a round, and to all of the people in my party at the same time, so it hasnt impacted any games in progress so far.  At a $20 price tag this game is more than worth it, I probably wouldn't have been upset with a higher price tag either after playing this game, its just that fun. I can highly reccomend this to anyone who thinks that this game looks fun, but might not be worth the price.",

The idea is simple and easy to learn, but hard to master. The gameplay is nonstop fun, and puts you on edge every time that ball gets to your side of the arena.  The game game balance is great because NO ONE IS OP. There are different car types, but they don't really affect gameplay. The customization is great AND FREE! I can not tell you how happy I was to see that the game developers thought about their community and didn't make users pay extra for something dumb like customization.  The only part that I don't like about this game is it's ranked mode. There is a 1v1, 2v2, and 3v3. The only problem is that you can't invite friends to play in a 3v3. It is strictly soloque. This really needs to change. I can't tell you how many times my two friends and I want to play ranked, but can't because of this.  I love this game and will be playing it for a long time.

            "review_text": "Excelling in sport means knowing when a moment is outside of your control and recognizing when an opportunity is there to seize. In Rocket League, both events occur countless times in any given match--not surprising for a game heavily inspired by soccer. It caters to the competitive realist who thrills in having sole control of the ball for a few seconds despite knowing it can be snatched at any time. The best part is that you get to kill opponents' dreams and agonize in your own losses from the comfort of a very, very fast car.  Every moment in Rocket League demands split-second judgment. Are you the assertive type who takes control of the immediate situation at the risk of being in the middle of a chaotic, unpredictable scrum? Are you more of a long-term planner, one who watches your cohorts fight over a ball in a corner with the confidence that the ball will inevitably escape. When this happens, are you ready at the top of the penalty arc with the hope that the loose ball will roll between you and the goal? This echoes Wayne Gretzky's words of wisdom: 'A good hockey player plays where the puck is. A great hockey player plays where the puck is going to be.' Rocket League offers countless opportunities to be Gretzky--or Nostradamus.Rocket League thrives on speed and momentum. This is best exemplified by the gravity-defying excitement of driving up the side of any of the game's arenas. This ability is useful as well as thrilling. Without the curves along the edges of the pitch, cars would simply bang into the wall. Constantly having to reverse and make three-point turns over a five-minute match would be a disappointing series of momentum-ending buzzkills. Rocket League has none of these obstacles. The curved corners means you do not lose momentum. Your tires will smoothly caress these bends as you ride the walls horizontally, chasing the ball in parallel with rest of the cars on the pitch. Given that the ceiling is also fair game, every player will feel compelled to attempt a gravity-defying loop across the width of the roof. The game's physics and your limited boost will prevent you from completing such a stunt, but you'll attempt it anyway.The ball in play is comparable to that perpetually bouncing beach ball you find at every music festival, only slightly less buoyant. It bounces and flies in unpredictable directions when touched by two parties at the same time. This is where fortune favors the Rocket League sportsperson who embraces chaos. Transcendence comes when you realize you don't have to be in control of the ball at all times; you should chase it only when you think you can make a difference.A goal scored ends the fleeting, yet fulfilled, existence of a ball. In its death, the ball's life is celebrated with a literal bang. It's a colorful, smoke-filled explosion that sends all the cars flying away at heights and velocities that would kill any human in real life. It is so spectacular that you can't help but savor the blast, even if you weren't on the team that scored. Rocket League is that rare kind of video-game sport where you're compelled to play your best, even when you're being blown out 5-1 and there's only a minute left on the clock.  There's no shortage of advanced ball handling in online multiplayer. In Rocket League, experience leads to tactical thinking. Tactical thinking leads to performing with finesse. You cannot open car doors to use them like arms; that would be the equivalent of a handball in soccer. Instead, you can spin your car forwards, backwards, and sideways, which is analogous to bicycle kicks and headers. Once you learn to use these moves to advance the ball, you are soon ricocheting shots on goal. Over time, you also discover that your chances of scoring are boosted by hitting the car closest to the ball rather than the ball itself. It's all obvious highlight reel material, which is why the replay save option is so welcome. Learning and mastering these advanced moves makes playing Rocket League endlessly absorbing, even after you've logged over 50 matches.Playing a single-player season in rookie mode is as useful a practice ground as the training mode itself. Without real-life competitors ruthlessly charging to the center of the field for the drop ball, you can practice making spectacular goals from midfield. The drawback is that imperfect A.I. applies to both teams, meaning that your computer-controlled squadmates will average at least one incompetent move per match, whether it's taking the ball to the far side of your end of the field or blocking your path to the ball.  Rocket League's replay value lies in the draw of constant participation, not in a progressive system of unlockable advanced abilities or shoehorned novelty modes. All the arenas are uniform and consistent in shape, without any bells and whistles like the terraces in its predecessor, Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars. The only variables are the team sizes, A.I. difficulty, and season lengths. This lack of flexibility adds legitimacy to the sport, mirroring the steadfast traditions within many professional sports, some of which are over a hundred years old.  The only thing better than a car with a Viking helmet and bubble exhausts are detailed blades of grass. The only thing better than a car with a Viking helmet and bubble exhausts are detailed blades of grass. This thoughtfulness extends to the studio's crafting of a convincing world where Rocket League is the number one sport. You see it in the multi-tier, sold-out arenas and you hear it from the indistinct chants of allegiance from the fans. The crowd goes 'Oooohhhh!' or 'Aaaaahh!', whether it's a goal or a key ball hit at midfield. These sprinkles of realism aren't strictly necessary but are greatly appreciated; for instance, the pitch itself features blades of grass that all move independently. These manicured fields are best admired during the pre-match camera shots, but you can't be faulted for staring at them in the middle of a game. They are complemented by the myriad customization parts, from wildly swinging antenna flags to neon-blue engine exhaust trails.  The joy of Rocket League rests on the countless plans that are conceived and discarded every other second in any given match. Trying to predict where and how the ball will bounce next is a game within the game. Despite the use of cars, Rocket League emulates the emotional surges typical of The Beautiful Game, such as the rush of an unexpected fast break or a well-timed header into a goal. With Rocket League, the promising concept of combining two wonderful things--cars and soccer--is equally magnificent in execution. You can't say the same thing about, say, combining cake and fruit to make fruitcake, as the comedian Jim Gaffigan observed.",

The controls are incredibly simple to understand, yet there are sophisticated techniques that even the most grizzled veterans will have trouble executing to perfection. Teamwork is requisite for success, and when paired against an equally skilled team you'll be hard-pressed to find another game that is more satisfyingly competitive. There is a level of intensity that this game will bring to you and your friends that most other games simply cannot compete with. Best of all, the price of admission is a measly $20; 1/3 of what I'd be willing to pay for a game of this caliber.  Furthermore, the technical details of the game are just as pristine as the gameplay. The menus flow gracefully and the multiplayer is admirably consistent. You'll be out of a match and into a new one before you have time to get a glass of water.  There was an idea that was Rocket League, and this idea was executed to perfection. Not once have I longed for something more than that blissful experience this game provides. If you're opening your wallet for a game any time soon, make it this one. You will not be let down.",

I mean i will miss the sale but i know i will enjoy the game. FOR SURE. So if anyone is really 50/50 in the whole buying project i say go for it.  In terms of online multiplayer mode I didn't really try it out, and i didn't think i could but anyways if you want to know how good Multiplayer mode is check the other reviews regarding.

Train whenever you can. Even when you're searching for a match, take advantage and warm up in the training.  The best way to play as a beginner is with a party, so if you have friends who play this game, play with them.   I do recommend a controller for this game, I personally use the Xbox360 afterglow controller, seems to be running very well.  Another thing to add, change the controller key binds and camera settings to what makes you most comfortable.  It's possible to play splitscreen too, if you have 2(or more) wired controllers, you can plug them in and enjoy splitscreen with your friends.  As for the DLC, if you want to get one, i recommend the Supersonic Fury DLC. It has the best cars and they are mostly used by pros.",

I have invested around 15 dollars into this game and im level 31 and know how to do basic aerials and redirects. This game has a insanely high skill cap, which means that you should still be able to learn more about the game even if you have 3000+ hours in the game. I dont really like soccer/football irl, but i love rocket league. Real life ball-kicking has nothing to do with rocket league, in fact it is totally 2 different things. This game is fun because once you pull off one of those backwards-turtle-reverse-aerial shots, you feel amazingly satisfied. If i had a say in improvements in this game, i would say that you could improve visibility as my friends could not tell where i was due to environments' background colour such as the underwater submarine level as the goals are almost/the same as my car's colour.

I have never enjoyed Football, Cars or highly competitive games and yet, when the three are combined in this mental moshpit of a video game, it just works.  Is it worth £15? It might not seem that way at face value but if you trust the game enough to buy it, you'll recieve an incredibly rewarding and hilariously satisfying game that you can just keep coming back to.  It's not without it's negatives. The AI, although challenging to entry level players, becomes hilariously inept after a good 50 or so hours in and I do disapprove of the crate and key system, but my hundreds of hours in game should prove that it hasn't really bothered me enough to make me stop playing.

So in conclusion, Rocket League is a fantastic game and I highly reccomend it to anyone considering buying it.

I dont know if it was a recent update or if the servers are on thier way out but it used to run perfectly and now i cant play the game at any competitve level.   I say this in hopes that if this is a problem others are experiencing and it is in fact not on my end. than the boys and girls in charge of this game will make an effort to fix this problem. I'll put this game over any other game ive played in all of my time on this earth but unfortunately its unplayablity has made it a dead game for me.

Rocket League is a physics based game of soccer, where you instead of controlling a humanoid player, instead you are controlling a car with a rocket strapped to the back where you try to hit an oversiezed ball into the opposite goal of your color. What makes this game so genius is how simple it is but at the same time it is deep enough and complex enough to master so it would qualify as an esport all on its own while sitting next to other esport titles such as league of legends, Dota 2, as well as a number of fighting titles and more. This game while outside the core game modes such as 1v1 up to the hectic 4v4, it is rather light on everything else, pretty much everything else is unlocking cosmetics such as hats for your cars, paint schemes, extra cars, and antenas; and the season mode which is basically you pick a team( each team has a different color scheme and unique color scheme). and you play against a number of bots with custom difficulty settings as well as the number of bots, sadly you cannot play season mode online but there is a hope. All in all Rocket League shines in its addictive core game mode of online teamVSteam soccer. Once you start playing you will be hooked into its addicting gameplay.",

Rocket League is a very simple, but very well executed game. It's remote-controlled cars with aerial abilities and football (+ hockey, basketball and a variety of experimental areanas) combined to create an addictive multiplayer experience. On the surface it looks silly, but you really have to play it to understand what all the fuss is about; great gameplay experience with an energetic atmosphere, that requires skill to pull off some amazing goals and is even more fun with friends. Controls are solid and performance is buttery smooth to boot. Cars are customisable with new bodies, decals, paintwork, toppers (hats etc.) and antenas. New content such as game modes are added to the game for free, however you can pay a little more for some extra customisational options (though do note that these are completely aesthetic, no stat boosts of any kind).  Highly recommended to those who want to try something different. Believe me, it's worth it for hours of fun!  Edit: They're adding Steam Workshop support for custom levels, what more do you want?",

There is always something new to learn! - Casaual and Competitive modes - The only thing that affects your gameplay is which car you chose, all other costomizations are visiual only - AI and singleplayer is great when you first start - Gives you a reason to live once you get addicted - Great Party and Trading systems - You will want to make friends with people you find you play best with - Awesome training modes - Custom maps to explore - Not a very hardware intense game  Cons: - You really should buy a controller if you want to get any good - You NEED a high framerate for this game, anything under 55fps will not cut it in my opinion - Once you get more experienced you will develop a dream to go to RLCS and begin to train tirelessly ignoring your homework, family, and responsibilities. You will find yourself staying up till 2:31am playing and dream of making amazing air dribbles in your studyhall as you catch up on sleep.  Tips: - Find people you play well with and try to get to know them and play with them - The youtube community is amazing. There are plenty of really helpfull tutuorials online from great players!  And...Then there's NeatMike and the rest of F2. - When chosing a car, how well you play with it is always more important than how it looks - Learn how to jump up and meet the ball asap, sticking to the ground will punish you eventually - Train, Train, Train. Pratice is the best thing you can do to help your game - Ball controll is always more impressive than lucky freestyles  Brb gonna go play, just 5 more miunites ;)",

Hands down the worst part of this game is the community that plays it. I'm sure that 90% of players are fine, but that vocal 10% that get into chat and try to troll the whole game is a really sad drawback. No, it doesn't make me angry because I can troll with the best of them, but it actually makes me a little sad that I can't honestly say something like 'really nice save,' or 'that was bad luck' to an opposing player without getting 'U MAD?' in response.

Many own-goals will pass (and still they will come at a higher level) once you figure out the controls and how to hit the ball in your advance.   Then comes the first goal. Feels amazing doesnt it? It will only get better from now. Its when you make a series of goals that you think i could do this prettier...  There where goals are, are goalies to defend the goal from happening. It might be even more important to keep goals from happening on your side than to score on the opposite site. Hitting the ball out of the goal isnt enough, the opponement might still be able to hit the ball you just cleared towards the goal, unsaveable for you... shame... The trick is to not only defend the goal, but also to defend the rebound. Its always easier to keep a tie than to work your way up from a possible defeat. This defending however might require the following:  Aerial gameplay comes in now. Not only hitting the ball in the air, but using that hit to your advance to play to a teammate or perhaps even to yourself that you will continue the aerial play. Defending aerially isnt too hard... Just try to shoot at your own goal, but way too hard and high, works for me every time.  Now that skill is aquired you can perfect those skills to your advance and work your way up the ranked ladder to eventually hit grand champion. Every win feels deserved (kind of) and every loss... well a loss. Be mindfull of your teammates, as they can be a little unpredictable.  After 1300 hours i can truely say that i enjoy the game and still look forward to play a game every single day.",

The controls for Rocket League take a little getting used to, but when you have finally mastered them it feels amazing to be launching yourself all of the field and causing the other team havoc! My favourite moments are when defending the goal, the entire opposing team charges in for a shot and you deflect and can instantly follow up with a free shot at goal yourself :D  Recommend getting a controller for easier and more fluid control, although have not tried the keyboard much to say if it is worse or not, driving with a pad is far more comfortable for me...  I found myself to really quickly adapt to the gameplay, which I think surprised a lot of the people in my early matches as the matchmaking system tries to (when it can) keep players balanced in terms of level although you will often see a team of semi-pro vs a team of at least 2 rookies. Not a lot can done about that I don't think, as your level is pretty much indiciative of your play time not your skill.",

It brings together people from console to PC (PC MASTER RACE!). The concept of the game is very unique...  Not. There was a game I remember playing about 7 years that was the bae, but glitchy as my mom on steriods. Just the feeling of sucker-punching that big ball right into that net, NEVER BETTER. Also, I adore the fact that you can put hats on your car, AND THEY DONT COST MONEY. SUCK ON THAT TF2.  Overall, this game is off the chains...get it...off the ch-nevermind...

(so this is clearly a server problem!) - Lag  - The DLC is not that awesome.. - all cars feel the same, the dev should be considering a different play style for cars, muscle cars, exotic, etc.. the cars must have a different feeling and have a different specialization and weakness.. not just cosmetic!! (BUT DONT MAKE THIS GAME PAY TO WIN) - THE LOW SOUND!! the atmosphere isn't too good when the SOUND is so LOW..!!!! FIX it.  so the + and - is complete, now the overall rating and recommendation.  - are this a good game? Yes - is this game worth to buy? Yes, but wait for the discount. - is the DLC good? depends on the taste, but i think it's not worth it to buy full price (wait for discount) - Graphic? Good, nice lighting and sharp detail. - is this game will be alive in a long time? it depends, if the dev keep this game up to date and add many new features and content everytime, it will be alive.. - how's the connection? average, sometimes bad, the server isn't top notch server. sometimes you'll be disappointed by the connection issue.   OVERALL RATING: 80/100  i enjoy played this game, buy the DLC's, and play with friends makes this game more FUN.. the issue only from Server problem, LOW SOUND, and not-too-good-DLC  i reccomend you buy it when this game on sale.. but, whatever... it's a decent game.. and very addictive.",

Rocket League includes vast customisation across its cars, with many different things for you to change, including tires, colours, hats and even car shapes; over 10 billion possible customisations! And if that isn’t enough, an extra 7 DLCs include another 8 cars and billions more combinations to make.  Rocket League has a small established competitive scene. With small competitions being hosted by organisations such as ESL, Rocket League’s competitive scene is beginning to grow and grow, giving the game a new level of skill and enjoyment. But the competitiveness doesn’t start from the top. With casual game modes being introduced such as “Chaos”, “Snow Day”, “Rocket Labs” and “Hoops” the game isn’t only under a competitive nature, but the game features competitive game modes and a ranking system in 1v1, 2v2 and 3v3 games where your skill will ultimately determine your rank.  The game also looks and feels brilliant. The maps and cars look pixel perfect at max settings and the game just feels generally smooth. But despite this, for me (and probably many other) the game is extremely choppy and frames are dropped at max settings, meaning that high graphics has to be sacrificed for smooth gameplay. This should be fine though if you have a high spec pc.  Altogether I think that Rocket League is an amazing game. It’s a game that can be played for 5 minutes if you have 5 minutes to spare, or played for hours on end. The enjoyment just doesn’t stop. I’ve played this game for 75 hours, and I’d gladly put in 75 more.  If you haven’t already: grab the game; grab some friends; and play!  8.5/10",

I had doubts about buying the game myself, so here are a few pros and cons that might help you decide to buy the game. If you like cars and/or balls, you should already consider buying this game.  Pros:  - Noob friendly: you can start off by facing bots and there are some tutorials that are very good in my opinion - Controller friendly (in fact I highly recommend using a controller) - Awesome party game thanks to split screen! (very underrated!) - Car custumization: there is not a whole lot you can do, but you'll never see the same car twice and it's easy to unlock new stuff - Nice gamemodes (football, basketball, icehockey and experimental arenas) - Quickchat (examples are: 'Take the shot!, Sorry! and Defending...')  Cons: - Very toxic community, it's even worse than the GTA V online community in my opinion: expect to get rammed a lot by teammates who refuse to communicate using quickchat, and enemies taunting and spamming all the time. It's not even rare to face two goalkeepers in one match (which means scoring goals is nearly impossible). Don't get me wrong, there are some nice guys and girls out there, but they sadly are very rare. - Even the most difficult bots are pretty easy to defeat once you know what you're doing. However, you can increase the difficulty (offline only) by adding extra bots to the enemy team: you can face up to 4 bots on your own. - If you don't have any friends who own this game, you may get bored pretty fast. - Cross-play is still not available: yes, you can face PS4 players, but you cannot send them friend requests/invite them to play the game  I hope you find this information useful, feel free to ask questions in the comments and I'll try to answer them :)  Have a nice day!",

I came across this game by accident, because suddenly everyone seemed to stream it on Twitch.tv while it was still in Beta. I showed it to my husband, and he got hooked, too. Then we spread the obsession to our gamer friends.   The game is optimized for controllers, but I prefer to play the PC version with mouse and keyboard; after rebinding most of the controls to my liking and experimenting with camera angles, I am doing just fine. The game controls smoothly, and I haven't experiences any lag spikes since it's out of the Beta. The graphics are gorgeous.   The only minus point I would give: There seems to be no way to play a multiplayer match in offline mode, for private LAN parties without internet access. Hopefully an offline mode will be added in the future.",

I can only go on my experience and, in my experience, the game is broken. Unplayable. Shame.  ORIGINAL REVIEW: Recommend with a HEAVY caveat. There's a bug that some people experience (it's out there on Google) that's been around for well over a year and doesn't seem to be getting fixed. It causes the game to act severely laggy no matter how good your connection is. When I say 'literally unplayable', I'm not mis-using the word 'literally'.  The game is super fun. I got a couple weeks play out of it before it started acting up in the aforementioned way, teleporting and rubberbanding to the point where the game is worthless. I have no connection issues, packet loss, and the game registers a decent ping. None of the fixes Google has turned up have sorted this issue.  The game is definitely worth the price *IF* it works for you. If you get this bug, however, you may as well throw your money out of a window.",

But this is hands down the best sports game on the market for a long time.  It's easy to pick up, really difficult to master, the game looks good enough, the music and sound effects are superb, the physics are in-house, but really consistent and responsive, DLC is purely cosmetic, new modes being added every now and then, Psyonix are literally one of the best devs of the moment.   If you are still doubting, give it a try during the free weekend. It's 20$ full price and totally worth it, if I knew I would've saved myself the steep cost of FIFa this year. IT'S THE PERFECT SUBSTITUTE.   Having said that, and I guess it's impossible because exclusivity rights, but PSYONIX PLS, GIFF ChampionsLeague team flags, I'd pay for that, or BPL, or Ligue1, or LaLiga, or whatever.

I hope they eventually have multiplayer league support and essentially every mode that major sports games have because they would all be perfect.  THIS GAME COULD GET ME WATCHING ESPORTS.  I just can't recommend it highly enough.  They really do need to get to work fixing the online experience though.  I know this review seems to contradict itself, but that's kind of how the game is. It's crazy amounts of fun with friends, it really needs to be played. But the actual gameplay deserves more/better modes and better online and matchmaking.  And claiming random matchmaking is cross-platform play is just dirty but that's on the publisher, not the game.",

They revolutionised European armies and played out on an unprecedented scale, mainly owing to the application of modern mass conscription. The wars were a continuation of the Revolutionary Wars, which broke out in 1792 during the French Revolution. Initially, French power rose quickly as the armies of Napoleon conquered much of Europe. In his military career, Napoleon fought about 60 battles and lost seven, mostly at the end of his reign.[22] The great French dominion collapsed rapidly after the disastrous invasion of Russia in 1812. Napoleon was defeated in 1814, and sent into exile on the island of Elba; he then escaped and returned to power, only to be defeated at the Battle of Waterloo, and was exiled again, this time to Saint Helena.",

Then i got pretty good, i practiced daily, tried new things and the wow... i was 98th in the world, got into platinum (season 1 top rank).... Next season comes along, i hit the champion league (lowest of the top 3 divisions), i got up there with the big boys.. Got invited to play in the ESL tourney. I ACCEPTED! Now im a sweaty guy who takes his rank seriously..... What im saying is this game is for everyone, you can spend countless hours having a laugh and doing ♥♥♥♥all but playing around or you can take it to the next level and go into professional playing. The game really suits everyone and i would literally recommend it to anyone, Honestly guys, you cant go wrong with this buy.... Its not even that expensive really.  10/10 My favorite game!",

Tip: If you have problems starting the game on Windows 10, try to reinstall several versions of Microsoft Visual C++. In my case it was the 2013 verison that solved this Problem.  Still I don't like Microsoft for being that complicated. 'Updating a Windows Systems' always means 'Actually nothing has changed but stay tuned for some new errors! Oh, and we have a bunch of new functions you really don't want to use.' For big displays I can recommend Windows 10, because you have basicly a good looking WIndows 7 (and some odd Windows 8 functions). But the performance of the game does not really improve. So If you play RL on a small screen like a common laptop, I can recommend Windows 7, never had problems with that.",

At this point it is very important not to only play solo duel, because at this point you have to learn to be cooperative to play any other gamemode. Later on you learn to hit the ball in the middle of the air, and then you know pretty much all there is and can try amazingly cool stunts which you can find all over youtube. Be warned though. To get to this point you will most likely need to spend about 150 hours with this game.  P.S. Mostly only playable with a controller, so either get one, or don't get this game.

Lag and rubber banding in every single online match I have played makes it impossible to play which is why I cannot recommend Rocket League as it stands.

Step 2 - Blanch the broccoli in boiling water for 2 minutes, then drain well and set aside.  Step 3 - Finely shred the ginger. Then heat a large frying pan or wok, add the sunflower oil, heat it until sizzling, and fry the ginger till it's crisp.  Step 4 - When it's done, remove with a slotted spoon. Add the chicken and garlic, and stir-fry until just browned. Remove the meat using a slotted spoon and set aside.  Step 5 - Add the red pepper and broccoli and stir-fry for around 2-3 minutes until it's just tender. Add the soy sauce mixture, bring it to the boil then return the chicken to the pan and heat through. Serve with noodles.  I can't think of a proper review, so here's my favorite soup recipe:    edited:  My favorite soup: Saltibarsciai. INGREDIENTS:  For the soup:  200 g | 7 oz boiled &amp; cooled beetroot (about 2 medium beets) 100 g | 3.5 oz cucumber (about 2 large pickling cucumbers, either fresh or pickled – see note above) 6 spring onions or 10 green onion leaves 2 hard-boiled eggs 1.5 litres | 3 pints kefir (or 500 ml | 1 pint thick natural yoghurt and 1 litre | 2 pints buttermilk) Bunch fresh dill Juice of ½ a lemon (optional) Salt to taste For the side dish:  200 g | 7 oz potatoes METHOD:  Peel the potatoes and chop into bite-sized pieces. Place in a saucepan of boiling water, add a good pinch of salt and boil until a knife can easily pierce the flesh. While the potatoes are boiling, assemble the soup. Slice the beetroot &amp; gherkins into fine julienne. Chop the eggs into small dice. Chop the scallions or onions leaves into 1 cm (½ inch) pieces. Finely chop the dill. Pour the kefir into a large bowl or saucepan and add the chopped ingredients and half of the lemon juice, holding back some of the dill for garnish. Taste and season salt and additional lemon juice as required. Ladle the soup into bowls and sprinkle with the remaining dill. Serve the potatoes on a side plate so that they do not heat the soup.",

My team mate knocks me out of the way, mid air, and he misses the shot.  The ball flings up and I circle around to hit it again, I miss because my team mate, the same one, hits me from behind.

            "review_text": "he server-breaking success of Psyonix’s Rocket League is a long-awaited validation of sorts for studio founder Dave Hagewood, who says his team tried to convince the world that a game best summed up as “soccer, but with rocket-powered cars” would be fun seven years ago.  “It was so difficult to communicate the pitch to publishers and platform holders back then,” he told me over Skype last week. “We’d tell them ‘Well, it’s a game about rockets and cars that can fly and jump and...they play soccer.’ And they looked at us like we were crazy!”  And to be fair, maybe they were. Psyonix eventually self-published that game as Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars on PlayStation Network in late 2008 to mild acclaim, and moved on to other projects. But they never forgot about the game; in a sense, it was a Rocket League rough draft.  “It’s like we’ve been taking notes for seven years on this game,” says Hagewood, who agrees that Rocket League is basically the UE3-powered car soccer game Psyonix wanted to release back in 2008. “We didn’t want to change the core of what that original Battle-Cars game was; we just wanted to do that game again, the right way.”  How Rocket League got its start as an Unreal Tournament mod  While it’s certainly not uncommon to see a developer polish and iterate on a compelling game concept, that work typically takes place across clearly-branded sequels and spinoffs released a few years apart, at most. Rarely does a studio wait for the better part of a decade before returning to an old idea.  But the core DNA of Rocket League is even older than you think: it almost predates the founding of Psyonix itself, stretching back roughly 12 years to Hagewood’s days as an Unreal Tournament 2003 modder. Like many developers, part of his efforts to break into the industry involved modding popular games; unlike many modders, he designed something compelling enough that Epic itself came calling.  “I added vehicles to UT 2003,” says Hagewood. “Epic had done the initial support, but I made a game mode out of it. They hired me as a contractor to make that game into something for UT 2004, and that ended up becoming Onslaught.”    Psyonix co-developed the vehicle-rich Onslaught mode in Unreal Tournament 2004 with Epic Games  The objective-based Onslaught mode’s big selling point was vehicle-based combat, and it was a key contributor to the warm reception UT 2004 received from players and critics. Working on it as a contractor at Epic taught Hagewood a lot about how a real game development studio operates, and he used that knowledge (as well as his contacts at Epic) to build up Psyonix.  “We built our business on that engine,” says Hagewood. “If you needed anything in Unreal, we were the company to call. But our ultimate goal was to make our own games.”  And indeed, Psyonix has worked on a smorgasbord of games throughout its history -- putting in contract work on projects like XCOM and Mass Effect 3 as well as developing its own games, like Arc Squadron and Nosgoth. But the simply joy of making those Unreal Tournament buggies bounce and fly stuck with Hagewood long after his contract with Epic was up.    'If you have a game concept that doesn't do well, it's not necessarily true that the concept is a failure. Maybe it just needs to be done in a better way, or at a better time.'  “That was kind of my big break in the industry, and me and Ben Beckwith, who was a level designer at the time, were really having a lot of fun taking one of the cars in the expansion pack and making it like, jump and spin in the air and do tricks and stuff like that,” he recalls. “After we started doing our own thing, we were trying to figure out how to make something really cool out of that car stuff.”  They tried all the obvious options -- adding in racing modes, obstacles courses and straight up car combat arenas. Nothing really stood out, until “Someone said ‘Hey, let’s put a ball in here,’” remembers Hagewood.  “I think he was a fan of Deathball at the time. So we started playing it, and within a week, nobody was doing any work -- they were just playing this game.”  The designers at Psyonix found that the physics-based charm of bouncing and rocketing cars around an arena was best complemented by heaving a massive ball in there with them.  “The rocket booster on the cars was really originally intended to just be like, a turbo option,” says Hagewood. “But we discovered, completely by accident, that you could jump, keep bosting straight up, and literally fly across the arena. It was the kind of emergent gameplay we had to keep around, and a few weeks later people were hitting goals by just rocketing straight across the maps.”  Hagewood remembers how much fun the Psyonix team had zooming around the field and smashing into the ball so fast it would fly like a bullet across the field and into the goal, but he also credits that frenetic design with turning off a lot of people to the original Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle Cars.    Psyonix's 2008 PSN game Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle Cars  “The original was too hardcore, so we slowed down the gameplay a little bit [for Rocket League],” Hagewood tells me. “And there were issues with online too, because we couldn't afford a dedicated server network back then. So if players happened to connect to someone with a laggy connection, it was a bad experience for everyone.”  Psyonix learned from the experience, and built the cross-platform (PC and PlayStation 4) multiplayer of Rocket League to rely on its tech wherever possible.  'We did a great deal of Rocket League's online services ourselves...we tried to make a lot of it independent and platform-agnostic on our server side,” says Hagewood. “From there, all we had to do was write interfaces to the various platforms so they all talked well together; by the time the data gets to the game's server network, the network doesn't care what platform anyone is on -- it just notes 'oh this person is on Steam, this person is on Sony,' and so on.”  This is intriguing for at least two reasons: first, it means that Psyonix had to figure out how to build a cross-platform multiplayer solution that played nice with the unique demands of two very different platform holders.  “The biggest problem is we can't mix friends lists or anything like that. Also, there are certain rules on Sony's platform about age restrictions and content restrictions, things like that,” says Hagewood. “We have to uphold those, and normally Sony can kind of control who on their platform can say what and they can ban people and stuff, and they don't on a cross-platform game. So we have to make sure there's nothing that can cross that barrier of liability to either side. That's been one of the biggest challenges, figuring out how to make it so players can communicate without breaking any of those rules.”  At launch, Psyonix simply sidestepped by not allowing players to communicate cross-platform -- when I spoke to Hagewood last week he claimed PlayStation 4 players could not see or hear messages from PC players in the same match and vice versa, though Psyonix was working to patch in support for cross-platform communication.  Dealing with success  But the studio has been bogged down solving the second, bigger consequence of rolling its own multiplayer solution -- trying to keep its servers online and functional in the face of unexpected player counts. While popular opinion of Rocket League remains high, Psyonix has been hustling to deal with persistent, pernicious connectivity issues following the game's launch.  ",

The matchmaking doesn't reflect your actual skill, like in Dead by Daylight, you can lose if you escape and you can win if you die. That is determind throughout the game. If you play well, repair things, have a good chase, you are rewarded. That doesn't happen in here. You can be the best player in the match, score 10 goals, if you get a bad teammate that drags you down and you lose, you derank. Simple as that. Fair? No. Needs to be fixed? Yes. Have there been any changes made in the year or so? No. That is one, the main reason, why I retired from this game.  Another thing that matters is the addition of stupid maps in competetive. If Neo Tokyo is still in there, pray for not playing there.  You have basketball and hockey mode + Rocket Labs, which no one plays, and if you somehow find a game, you score 2 goals quickly and everyone will disconnect. So what is the point.

There is now a trading system, but there are only 4 very rare items, and you only really want one of them, so what is the point.  Plus, to top it off, the community is even more toxic than DOTA's and CS:GO's combined, so be prepared for a bunch of people who will blame you if you play great, while they don't, and you derank.  1/5 stars for the concept, potential is there, but there need to be MAJOR changes made to get me interested again.",

Ingredients: 1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 2. 1/2 cup white sugar 3. 1/2 cup brown sugar 4. 1/4 cup water 5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon 6. 1 pinch salt 7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced 8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie   Directions: 1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",

You'll be okay for the first dozen or so games, but this is one easy to learn, tough to master game. The more you play the more you realize what an idiot you are.   TL;DR; PRO: You can fly. YOU CAN FLY! WHAT?! CON: No boss battles.   Pros:  Easy to learn.   That sense of euphoria when you score.   One of the better online multiplayers as the matches are short which makes losing less frustrating than other games where you spend a lot of time on a match just to end up losing because of a misplay by you/team mate.   Rumble mode is a ton of fun especially with friends.   Theres tons of content online, tutorials, professional games etc., and the community is a great help!   Cons:  Needs better UI for figuring out which server has the best ping for you. Important especially if you're nowhere near to a dedicated server.   Perhaps a facility to view friends' games and add friends from the in-game menu.   Match making system can be broken at times. It will randomly pit rookies with veterans(and/or higher). I once played against a professional RLCS player from SA and I had just a dozen or so games under my belt. Not wins, mind you!   AQUADOME!! The fps drop is real.   10/10 would recommend.",

Online connectivity actually affects the match, with someone's connection pulling everyone on the team or even on the field down.  Overall I highly recommend this game. It's great for passive fun!  *Edit: Originally thought there was a bug regarding the decals, turns out there are only some decals that work with certain car bodies.

Edit #2: most major problems with input latency and other things have recently been fixed, feel like i can change my review to positive now, absolutely fun game when it works right, great time sink. glad they finally seem to have fixed whatever the issue was. can get back to playing again.",

Please come back home and start racing professionally when you're older!' Speed Ra-Mifune's dad shouts.  'Okay, dad! I shall come home!'

There seem to be some problems with the network code - I was in a multiplayer game with a ping of 32 just now but the whole screen was pulsing in and out, everything moving erratically. This has happened in every single game I've tried to play. It makes even seeing where the ball is impossible (to be honest, I couldn't even tell where I was half the time stuff was just moving so weirdly). I guess sync errors with the servers, but who knows.   It also crashes extremely frequently (every 1-2 games), but even though the crash reporter fires a half dozen times a day for me, they haven't patched the Linux client once as far as I can tell. It's hard to know if they're going to.  Local exhibition play is okay, but the bot AI is truly awful; a weird mix of perfect ball prediction and absolutely awful play. I've watched the bots sit on their own goal line as the ball rolls past them without making any effort to save. The number of times one bot on a team will just get lost at the far end of the pitch for no reason. Or you'll be in the middle of a dribble (of sorts) and a bot on your own side will fly over you and pass to the opposition... Or you'll be 2-1 up with 10 seconds left and your side will suddenly decide to score an own goal under no pressure. It's way too frustrating to recommend paying money to play against the AI.   Right now, you're paying full price for a game that is well below alpha quality on Linux.",

But, if you find yourself getting better and better and you switch over to ranked play, prepare to encounter salty, aggressive, and downright mean players on a regular basis, especially as you progress higher and higher up the ladder.  Maybe it's the nature of competitive gameplay, but as a person who has played a considerable number of hours in other competitive games in the past, this one is up high on the list of toxic communities. The playerbase of Rocket League, far more than the gameplay itself, frequently leaves me feeling upset and irritated after just a few matches. Every minor mistake is immediately met with punishing insults and taunting by your own teammates. Even though I will continue to play this game, it is because of the community that I encounter day after day that I have to say I ultimately do not recommend this game.  TLDR:  Great fun for casual play or matches with friends.

First of all the matchmaking will make you want to drink bleach since it dishes out mismatches every second game or finds out countless of other ways to f**k up the match before it even starts. Secondly I can say that I have played games from CoD's to League of Legends but Rocket League has the most toxic community there is for sure. There's not a single game where someone isn't screaming insults to the mic, writing trash comments in the chat or spamming the quickchat (Which by the way is the dumbest addition to ANY game, quickchat's have allways been and will allways be trash that only results in spamming and whatnot)  Then there's the whole 'physics' part which is driving me nuts... Sometimes just a light tap to another car sends them flying to another reality whereas sometimes even if you ram into someone with supersonic speeds it's like you've hit god himself, when the other car simply stops you on your tracks.. And lastly atleast in my opinion, every addition they've made after the *Battle Cars dlc has been making the game somehow worse. It's like the creators are pushing content out forcibly on gunpoint, since they seem to lack the fun and simplicity that made this game so special to me once..    So when you combine this matchmaking system with the toxic community and half-a**ed physics you're just bound to not have a good time.  As an idea, visually and atleast somewhat mechanically this game is surely a 9-10/10, but when you're actually playing and trying to enjoy the game it's is barely a 2/10.

It has been slowly going down the wrong path with the addition of crates, the Rumble game type, and AquaDome. The addition of the AquaDome arena is the main driver for this negative review. My laptop (see specs below) is under spec and I get that but have been able to happily play many hours with low quality graphics and get a very playable 30 fps. Then they added AquaDome. I get a very choppy, laggy 10 fps and have to account for a 1 or 2 second delay. Now this was never a problem until this arena and it is negatively influencing my ranking. Every time I play in that arena in a ranked match my team loses because I cannot contribute. Once again, I understand that I am below spec but with the direction this game is going, it will make it unplayable on a wide range of computers and that's a shame to see. I try my hardest to avoid that one arena but that's impossible in ranked matches.

I have a feeling this is going to be a BIG game and have some energetic competitive leagues. As you may have heard the servers where down on launch for an extended period of time (about a day i think). i used this time to get good at goalie and unlock some intresting hats while some in the community cried for a refund. i hope they got it because this community doesnt need thier negativity and they are much more welcome elsewhere.  Here are the pros/cons from what I've seen. Pros: - Fun Physics. - Crazy rocket powerd arial moves. - Multiple cars all with different hit boxes. - AI on All-star mode are crazy good and pro can be a challenge too. - Positive community from what I've seen. - Tons of customizations. - The teams in season mode differ in skill so your not just playing the same team over and over  ( EX: one team is 11-1 and another could be 3-8, you will end up playing both). - The developers are transparent and hard working, pretty sure none of them slept trying to get the servers up. Check thier twitters tweets and responses if you dont belive me lol. - Decent player base.  Cons: - Occasional lag spike (servers are still new and under massive stress, this will obviously improve with time).    TLDR; Buy it, its worth the $20 unless you're a PS+ member (its free for them) Also if your wondering if you can play with keyboard and mouse, it works fine.",

In the old ranking system it was at least 50-50, you win one you go up, you lose one you go down. But now it's unfair and even if you're already a pro losing unlucky games drags you down the ladder and reaching the top could take up to hundreds, maybe thousands of games.   Please return to season one ranking system instead of leeching the ideas of others (CSGO), you literally copied their ranking system with 'new' creative names for each step.",

It happens in, ranked and normals, playing ranked and then their team scores a goal because it's impossible to play.  However it does seem like in a game of 2v2's only 2-3 people will get the lag, 2 of which will get it extremely badly and 1 will get minor lag spikes, leaving 1 player totally un-affected. I have played the odd game when I've had 0 lag spikes with perfect ping and everyone else in the game is complaining about it. -I'd suggest unless you want to buy it and play custom, against bots. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! Or unless the devs release a statement that they're getting attacked and that's why their servers are laggy.  In addition, I've played against people that have said they're NEVER experienced lag, but this was when I started to change up the servers thinking it was the European server, but then other people from those servers have said they are experiencing lag too.

Players have asked countless times for the option to choose what maps they want to play on, a feature which would make everyone happy with no negative effects whatsoever, but the devs still didn't give us anything besides a likes and dislikes system, which doesn't prevent unwanted maps from showing up anyways.  As fun as the game can be when not thrown into horribly bad maps, until they give players the freedom of choice i will not recommend it to anyone, and i hope a thumbs down will be a more effective way to get devs to listen to the negative feedback than posts on a forum which they don't seem to read.",

        {
            "review_text": " tl;dr version:  Very good basic game, but still lacking a lot of polish and features. Feels a bit EA, still, in that regard. Recommendable for private play, where it plays out as fun as any multiplayer arena game- but absolutely not recommendable for public play, where frequent server issues, an overwhelmingly toxic and exploitative community, numerous unresolved bugs and design flaws, and lousy matchmaking all make for a game that is more often than not very disagreeable to play.  ~ ~ ~  Great game, offering a blend of childhood marbles like physics fun, racing hijinks, soccer gameplay, and even arena brawling. It's a game that's inherently easy to pick up, play, and enjoy, and really, plays just the way you'd expect it to from the videos and screenshots, no disappointments in that regard. So really, if it looks at all interesting to you, you should pick it up!   ..wait, or not.   For a good while now, there've been some significant issues in the game that the developers have failed to address in any way, and it mars an otherwise solid game.  * Horribly toxic community, seemingly no oversight by the devs in that regard. You can mute the players for that single match, but it doesn't carry over to any other match, or prevent regrouping with them. It also doesn't address other abusive gameplay elements- idling (for drops) is a key example, being so common that you're bound to bump into it after just a couple of runs (and during the holiday events, expect this to be nearly every run) There are a lot of amazingly capable and fun and positive players in this game, and if the developers approached things with any degree of oversight, this might actually be one of the better communities in an online game. Unfortunately, as with any MMO where toxic individuals understand that there are no punishments for acting out, what should be a minor occurance has wildfired.  Doesn't help that the report function no longer allows you to report users once they leave a match, so you'll sometimes get people deliberately sabotaging their team, spewing a bunch of curses, and then ragequitting. On the other hand, when I've discussed reporting users to other players, the positive-minded players gave a clear impression of 'it's useless, the devs won't do anything' while the negative-minded ones laughed and- well, said the same thing. So that's clearly the biggest issue of it all.  * Input recognition failures, flip recognition failures, ability activation failures, contact recognition glitches- most of these issues can be explained by server issues that've persisted (and in many ways, only grown worse) since the Rumble release some time back. But they're common, and they're going to bite you in the ♥♥♥ at least a couple of times each match, most matches. Some matches are completely unplayable because of these issues.   * Joining in-progress matches doesn't prevent you from rejoining a match you left (due to toxic players), and despite a recent patch, still spawns you in at very disadvantageous circumstances, often leading you to run right into the ball upon spawn, sending it as-often-as-not into your own goal.   * Rumble mode is unpolished, with several minor quirks. Most notably, the inability to properly target with targeted abilities and their often switching targets as you activate them, can cause you to inadverently help your opponents, rather than hinder them.   * General modes don't use any sort of ranking system to make sure you get decent matches, or even matches to your skill level, so it's always a complete crapshoot to lobby up. On the other hand, ranked modes are based on the (in my opinion) very subpar 3v3 mode (if that was all the game had, I wouldn't actually recommend it- due to the size of most of the arenas, and the sometimes glitchy physics, it's too easy in standard 3v3 to get a lucky shot into a goal).   Mind you, this isn't really a flaw with 3v3 itself, but with the maps used for 3v3 (which are typically better designed for 4v4). Hoops, the basketball mode, also suffers from being better suited for 3v3 play (and a slightly larger map) than for 2v2. Meanwhile, on the opposite side of things, Hockey (3v3) lacks the physics glitches of normal 3v3, due to its hockey-puck shaped ball, and works fabulously in 3v3. Rumble (the mode with activatable abilities) is crazy enough to get by in 3v3 as well, and Chaos (4v4) is the ideal team play mode, working far better with most maps than 3v3 does.  So, the option is to play standard ranked (which you can't easily leave without closing client the way- which in a way is understandable, but also makes bad public groupings all the more painful. Definitely do ranked with a team of players you're comfortable with, rather than public grouping it.), or to play unranked matches with no meaningful matchmaking system at all, but far better mechanics and balancing.  At least from my perspective and preferences, the game is lacking a lot of polish.  * Outside of holiday drops, and the game's premium chests, cosmetic drops appear to have been reduced to very rare drop rates along with the Rumble update a while back. If you enjoy unlocking cosmetics (and in this game, you can trade in sets of 5 cosmetics for a random cosmetic of one higher rarity tier, so it's rather enjoyable) expect that appeal to be rarely encountered. On the other hand, chests seem plentiful enough, so if you're into purchasing your cosmetics, hey, the devs would be glad for your funds. Which, y'know, isn't so bad- except all the premium cosmetics are the most gaudy, shiny, flashy things the devs can come up with. If you want anything that's actually stylish, coordinated, subdued, subtle, or otherwise not mid-life-crisis or teenager-making-a-statement, then you'll need to grind those non-premium drops to get something appealing.     The game is fantastic, no doubt. And when you get good pairings, it's a calculated sports game, with all the appeal of a racing game throwin in, with fabulous teamwork potential. Other than the above issues, and still lacking a bit of variety in modes and maps, the game is thoroughly solid.  So I'll gladly swap this to a positive review in an instant- as soon as the devs at least give firm indication that they care about the general gameplay of the game as much as they do their premium leagues.  That's not me being petty with my review, but a simple fact to the rating system Steam uses: While I can definitely say I enjoy this game, I can't at all say I  recommend  it in its current state. There's just too much frustration in it.  Then again, if you avoid the public gameplay altogether, and just play on teams fully crewed by friends? If you view this as that kind of game, rather than as a public MMO, then by all means, this game is recommendable.  In fact, inherently I'd put this among the topmost games in both sports and arena brawlers, comparable to any of the best ones out there (except for the lack of polish in some areas, and with having less scale than most sports games, and having less variety of content than most arena brawlers).  If you're intending this for play with friends, either in closed groups or in a ranked team, then I highly recommend giving this game a go. If you're in for the public gameplay aspect, then it all boils down to how easily you're frustrated by toxic MMO communities and bad servers, compounded with other minor stresses.  Personally, I end up leaving one play session out of four deeply satisfied- and the remaining three stressed and exhausted, from a game that was meant to relax me.",

I could have easily written a positive review for this game, but I didn't choose to do so.  POSITIVES:  - Decent graphics - Lots of cosmetics - Not any noticable bugs  NEGATIVES:  - Gets old very fast with few gametypes - Cross-Platform, so instantly PC players are better due to inferior console controls - Ranking system that relies more on levels than ranks - Expensive Price (20$, which is pretty ambiguous coming from a indie company and a steam game...) - SAME FREAKING SONG EVERY TIME YOU OPEN THE GAME (jk I still love you...)  OVERALL:  This game tries to be competetive, which is where it fails most. I'd say at the least its a fun casual game, but personally I don't think I could ever get into this game like I do with games like CS:GO or Overwatch. Decent title, but far too overpriced as mentioned before.

It was developed on Unreal Engine 3, which is alright. It looks good (except for the wierd fov rendering), physics are alright and so on... Fun concept, design of the cars...  Now for the problems. First off, this costs 20€. If you going to sell something like that expensive, you need content, you need replayability. All maps are the same except fom really minor changes, only one playable mode (you do have sort of campaign with SEASONS but you will beat the AI everytime). And what about the content? Do you unlock every car by leveling up (not sure why there is there a leveling system)? 'What?, No? DLC CARS? FOR 1.99€ A CAR? OR 3.99 FOR 2 CARS?' Now its NOT a pay-to-win situation because all cars have same stats. But why am I paying 20€ for locked off content, which is already in game? Do I really need to pay 64.85€ to have content? Are you serious? The basic version has barely content for 7,50€ game... If it was a free title then sure, but NEVER HAVE THIS KIND OF DLC IN A PAID GAME!  Oh and there are crates... with keys you need to buy to unlock them... like CS:GO...  Players are not worikng as a team. In a team-based game. All they want are goals, and they hate you if you take it from them.  Hate this review all you want, its not even going to lower the overall review stats anyway. People must be blind that they dont realize, they are spending alot of money by paying for these DLCs.  Conclusion? I do enjoy playing this from time to time, but I never should have bought this for 11.69€, no content... and the music is not good...",

Here is what ruined it for me: -The idea of football with cars sounds great on paper but in practice its unplayable (although I have to give them credit for the neat controls, at least it isn't as hard as playing football with cars would be in real life) the in-air controls could have used some work though (with that note pretty much the funnest thing to do in this game is ramming your opponents).  So thats pretty much it, I would tell you to play a different video game with football (or basketball, gahd what ever) instead of this but then again in my opinion they are all ♥♥♥♥ and you should just play those sports in real life (if you can't then I am sorry but you will never truly enjoy it... EVER!). This game is pretty over hyped just like CS:GO, League of Legends, Dota 2, Rust, Ark, and others that have not come out yet or I havent heard of.

It is the only game that makes me want to throw my PC out of a window and jump on it until there's nothing left.  There are three ways to play the game, with AI which only understands the ability to chase a ball and jump and hit it, with local players on splitscreen which leads to graphic glitches and with humans on PC or PS4 online.  The AI, as I've said, is thicker than the earth's mantle layer and will own goal at will. Because the matchmaking is horrific since the addition of the option to disable cross-play, finding someone to fill in the places on a doubles, standard or chaos match will be impossible forcing you to team up with the AI. While I'm there, the option to disable cross-play has lead to the ghettoisation of the online servers. While originally there were plenty of servers will many people available to play, once you get to a server with no PC team mate, you're stuck there for good.  Fun fact, I once waited half an hour in the pre-match waiting screen with no one else because the matchmaking is broken.  That's before I get to humans! The player base is the most vitriolic, toxic player base I've ever come across, and I used to play games on the Xbox 360 system! You make a mistake such as timing your move wrong, or you misjudge where the ball lands and you're branded as 'noob', 'f***tard', 'easy' or something else. And if you're lucky enough to have a human team 'mate', they'll brand you with just the same amount of silly vitriol, perhaps more.  The game servers are better than they used to be, but are still horrific. You could be stable at 40-50 ping then suddenly because someone else on the same broadband internet connection opens up a web page you go to 800 ping and start rubber-banding more than flubber. Not everyone has Fibre To The Property broadband and lives in the likes of London, New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Paris, Berlin or wherever the fastest internet connections are.  If I have fun, it's for a handful of minutes, then at that stage, it's gone and I feel like I need to start hitting someone.  This game was made for E-Sports, but I hate the concept of E-Sports. There's no sportsmanship, there's no fun, it's serious twitch reactions, something that video games seriously need to excise.",

I'm not too good at the game just about every game I play, that's all I hear. 'LOL LOOK AT THE SCORE, YOU GUYS SUCK ♥♥♥♥' and the likes, as if it's a bunch of CoD 12 year olds. That being said, I simply don't play the game anymore. It's not because I 'can't take an insult', but more so that I don't like playing with immature kids. Not to mention that the DLC cars have better hit boxes or some ♥♥♥♥ like that.  To be quite honest, this game is like poker. Based off of luck, it seems. Especially with your connection. If you don't have tard low ping, you're pretty much screwed, so keep that in mind if you wish to purchase this game.  Additionally, the ranking system is terrible. Maybe this is what causes my troubles, but from my first online match, I was up against Veterans and not too long after, Experts.

So I was really quite certain that this game isn't for me, but a nice YT guy convinced me that it might be fun, if played with the right crowd.  That's the problem: The online sessions are broken. I have a play time of around 4h (more than 50% of that was incidently the game sitting idle in the menues, while I tended to my kids I guess. Steam refunds are only possible within the first two hours. Oh my...).  A normal session, limited to Europe as region, looks like this:  - Wait - Wait some more, because only 4 out of 6 show up - Wait times out, 2 bots join - Those bots score more than everyone else and do insane stuff  Yay. The AI is good. That isn't fun, though. It's rare to have a full human match and the difference in skill level - at my level - is too big. AI = Amazing, Everyone else is .. somewhere between incompetent and somewhat capable (I'm heavily leaning towards incompenent myself).  If you ignore that there are no (full) games: Even a mediocre difference in ping leads to a completely broken game experience. Mine is usually around 20, if some of the rare humans in a match have something around 90-100 the game is unplayable. The ball jumps back and forth, travels back in time and the game is - there is no other word - broken beyond repair.  Combine this: 'Not enough human players' with 'Enough latency and the game is unplayable' and .. well - fun, right?  I regret every cent I payed for this game. It's not only bad, it's the worst game for me this year and I don't recall a worse game from 2014. I wanted to exercise the 'Refund' option for the first time in my loooooong Steam history, for this very game. Unfortunately - as described above - sitting idle in the menus is 'playing the game' for Steam, so yeah, I totally 'played' this game for 4h so far and therefor cannot get my money back.  The least I can do is to state here that - The game is utterly broken - I advise you not to buy this game - You should - if you ignored the first two bullet points - give it 90min to confirm my complaints and instantly ask for a refund  Blech.",

You can customize your car but you can't customize your team. It's the things like this that make the game boring. I'll delete this review when they change all this and add more things like this to the game.

            "review_text": "This game has a simple premise, and a simple goal! Score! Put the ball in the opponents net! IT Couldnt get any simpler! Its Football with cars! And for the first hour it was fun! The tutorial eased me into the game nicely, yet I felt the game could still offer me a great challenge beyond learning the basics. The graphics the games stability (baring match making) were all admirable.  My first Online match couldnt have gone better, I sunk 2 in the net and the team went on to win 5 - 2. Great I thought, thourougly enjoyed. However an hour later, and honestly, I was bored! The more matches I played the more I realised that this is just a physics based pot luck game. Every match was essentially 8 cars throwing themselves at this giant ball, hoping to either get the ball into the opponents half or score! And thats IT! Theirs literally nothing else to the game! Yes you can customise your cars etc! But the cars arnt that detailed, theirs no difference between them other than shape/looks. A van type car you would think would be purposed more towards defence vs the sportier sleeker cars etc, but No! Each car is identical, so what happens online is nothing short of 5 mins of manic chasing this giant ball. Getting bashed around left right and centre by not only the opposition, but equally by your team mates.   I keep seeing people saying the game has multiple layers of depth, and you can tell the skilled vs the none skilled players etc. Guess what? My team of all noob Rookie labelled players, just beat an entire team of Semi-Pros 6 - 2. Did we play well! NOPE, we just launched oursleves at the ball blindly and hoped for the best! The hitboxes on the cars are sketchy at best. On countless occassions I slowed down and methodically hit the ball from a certain angle i.e. left or right. Only to have the ball bounce straight up in the opposite direction!? I've scored from one end of the pitch to the other, even though the ball was actually put in the net by the opposite team, trying to clear it from the goal! Apparently this game has no concept of HOME goals!  I've watched numerous Twitch games streamed, and I'm sorry! I am yet to be convinced their is anything skilled about this game! Yes I have seen some fancy goals scored on YouTube etc, and people stating thats the difference between a skilled and non skilled player etc. Equally! If probably not more so, I have seen many incredible goals scored completely without intention or knowledge of the player who scored them, i.e. blind luck (or dodgy physics engine!).   This game to me was a 5min pick up and play game with friends on a Friday night, nothing more! The hype and reviews on this game at the moment I just dont understand! Its football with cars, without the complexities or intricacies of the beautiful game. Just be careful when you buy!  Watch a few videos, ignore the web reviews, just watch! Then make your decision! This is by no means a bad game by any shout! In fact I'd probably give it a 7/10, its a quick and easy to get into pick up and play game! Just beware of the hype machine on this one.  ",

You know that you cant make your car better than others (at least in meanings of gameplay), you only can make it look so much better that the enemy team starts coughing when they see your car (wasnt the case til now ;) ). So no pay to win, just play for fun, glory (also glorious and hilarious moments) and win.  About the AI in offline battles: I have to say it does it job good, but sometimes I dont know what it wants to do( no human logic :) )  I hope I could help you with this review for Rocket League and I really suggest playing it with friends, because I think then it is much more awesome!

We've seen no progress on fixing it, just a post in the forum that claims they are fixing the issue but weeks later, nothing has improved.  The game is now festering on the installed games list, but now never played because of the unplayable lag.  You think your driving at the ball, then you go to hit the ball and you realised the ball is actually at the other end of the pitch. You turn you car right and it jumps 10 feet to the right and then fires you forward across the pitch, to only then fire you back to where you started.

The pro of this game is that beside of all that I said, the game is cool, it's good to pass your time, but if you're willing to play ranked and climb up, you're going to face a hard road.",

It's just a bunch of toy cars chasing an incredulously oversized ball against vividly colored if remarkably uninspired landscapes (Thunderdome, Steampunk, Toadstool castle courtyard?), but the more I was dragged into matches by my friends who loved the game, the more I saw the appeal. It's a massive mess of a game, playing with people like me who don't know what we're doing, and then the artful masters of the game who set up their own goals with careful dribbling and ball play (If you know what I mean...). Rocket League becomes not just a mad free-for-all, but a game of comradery, hard losses, daring comebacks, and the edge of your seat intensity of... well, being a real soccer fan.",

New game modes have been added such as hoops (basketball) and a hockey like mode. It's a good, fun, casual game that you don't have to invest a ton of time in but if you want to just play something for fun for an hour or two. Fun game and worth every penny in my opinion.",

This is just my personal opinion but I think it would make the game much better for all.  First I would take out the ability to 'fly'. I get it, it's pretty, and it does take some skill to do, but the problem is there are a lot of players who prefer keyboard and mouse, like myself. Using this ability is much harder on keyboard and mouse than it is on controller, giving those using controller and proficient with it an advantage. Just a thought, I think it's not really needed in a futbol game.  Then I would make demolition 'kills' last longer. Not too long, but right now there is no real benefit to demolishing an opponent, they spawn rather quickly and of no consequence. Either don't allow it or make it have some kind of consequence, make players have to keep their eye open for possible incoming in hopes of avoiding it. The only time it really benefits you is when you hit the goalie and the ball is already right on their goal.  Otherwise a super fun game. So far I've only played a few hours of it. Mostly playing Ranked right now, reached Silver so far in standard 3v3. I definitely reccomend it even with the things I would change.",

While this is mostly true, especially when you first start playing, you will occassionally encounter some incredibly skilled players who are flying around the arena a hitting the ball from heights that you hope to one day emulate.  The available game modes carry some minimal variety to the format to keep things fresh, but when the mechanics feel this responsive you canm spend many hours in one mode playing match after match.  I believe my feelings toward this game are best highlighted by the fact that after I played this game for many hours on the Playstationm 4 I did not hesitate to double dip on my purchase and buy it again once I found out a different group of my friends was playing on PC.  Rocket League is arguably the best game of 2015 because it is nothing but pure fun to play!",

But you have to wear the damn hats for the hight atvantage it gives you in blocking and in over all abillity to block goals with your big stupid hat. Hint. bigger and taller the hat the better.

Unfortunately theres cons, they removed some great stuff from SRPABC, but can be patched:  - No Auto-goals (theres lots of people who deserve humilation award )   - Reward medals at the end of each game. The only award avaible is the MVP award  they removed best wingman, goal keeper , and more... (its always good to have a shelf full of awards) medals can improve moral and performance. its scietific fact   - All the maps have the same format, the previous game had funny maps. i would like to see this in a patch some day but i dont know if its possible. the old maps are great.   i think its all i dont remember any more details, have fun.",

I have played some cod in the past, but the raging got worse and worse ( yes im that kind of person when other human players are involved sadly). I have dabbled a bit in LoL and Smite, same problem.    I Don't know what got into me to buy and try out RL, maybe a combination of boredom and to see what all the fuzz was about. I have several friends who play and praise it.   Like in the other games i mentioned at start it was very new and very fun, after a while i could hit the ball with some consistency and even get it to go in the general direction i was aiming for ! damn this is fun !  After about 40hours of unranked play i felt ready to tackle the lower divisions in ranked! getting out of unranked went pretty fast, and got me more motivated, prospects 1 just a tad ittle slower but also pretty fast. prospects 2 gave me some bloodboiling moments but after a few hours i got out of that too. then came prospects 3, my first wall in the game. As i got better ( so i thought ) Bad play from my teammates could really get on my nerves, here came my first few rage quits. As with cod, lol and smite, the same thing was happening again... I was blaming my 'noob' teammates i got paired with for holding me back. But then something happened that never happened before: Somehow this game made me TRULY realize that if i couldn't get higher ME, MYSELF and I needed to get better. and so i did. for half a day i practiced my saves and aerials in training mode, for another half day i only played unranked to practice my newfound skills. Then i tried ranked again, and got to prospects elite pretty quikly. This where i am now and i think this is another wall, but that's ok now, i'm not feeling mad anymore. offcourse there are still alot of moment i'm cringing a little inside but i can control the rage. There has never been a game where i could do that.  oh and i have the game 7 days now and played around 60 hours now i think. the no-life is real! also something that hasn't happend for some time now :)  TLDR  As many have said, it's a great game in my opinion. so i'm not gonna say the same stuff others have said. WHat i do like to point out is this.  Are you a rage quiter in pvp games ? can you almost throw your pc out of the window with those kind of games ? Because you get paired with noobs all the time ? Try out this game, it might be the game to cure your rage ;)  ",

The party system. You can have a party, but you can only play ranked with 1 other person for 2v2's. The only other ranked gametypes are for solo play, and they are 1v1-2v2-3v3 I believe they should allow parties to play anything from 2v2-4v4 RANKED. Exhibition can get pretty darn easy, so allowing the ranked increase will make this game 10x better  i have dual graphics, however i havnt had any issues with that. there is very minor server issues, but i really don't think it's the servers, i think it's the people Queing up. I've always been low ping in this game, however i see and vs people at like 160 ping constantly, and that creates skippy game play.",

I love games where you can compete with other to improve rank or rating so you can play higher ranked opponents. If there wouldn't be a ranking system.

I just can not adequately communicate or capture the value you get with your money on a game like this, and if you think you are a God at it, just please load up a Twitch stream of Kronovi (camgears) and then realize you have only just scratched the surface of what you can do in this game!

Seriously, go to the reddit and there are numerous stories of how bad ♥♥♥ these guys are. Drunk Girl being on the sound track was actually the result of some drunk dude emailing Psyonix about his unkown friend's song on soundcloud that he thought would really fit the game. Next thing you know it's one of the biggest songs on the soundtrack absolutely elevating this random artist's status. Not to mention how amazing all of the other songs are. Top notch music all around.  There were even several occasions where the dev interactions from the Rocket League reddit were posted on the No Man's Sky reddit causing a lot of those readers to fluctuate to Rocket League just based on how amazing these guys are.  These guys are a blessing for the video game industry and they made a damn fine game. Give them your support. Buy a four-pack for your friends. I swear you will get your money's worth plus more.",

Maybe it's because it has     Amazing graphics    High-quality gameplay    Fully Customizeable vehicles (for the most part)    Quality Dev Support and Updates (Unlike NMS which was a huge disappointment by the way)    HUGE player base    Multiplayer capabilites    And so much more that I'll leave considering purchasers to find out for themselves.   This game is a fantastic purchase, and in my opinion could   very likely   be sold for AAA price, instead of $20. I mean, with constant updates and developer support, it's well deserved (unlike NMS dear lord).  Rocket League is the type of game that you gives you some beginner's ground, but then leaves it up to you to become better as a player. The tutorial may not be the best, but it gives you a place to start, and then from there you can try the practices and become even better.   The controls are fully customizeable to suit one's playing style, and while I use the typical WASD (I actually use a Steam Controller) setup, it can be made for anyone.   The customizatiuon options are fantastic, althogh there are a couple of DLC cars (the Batmobile and the Back to the Future Time Machine) that don't offer more customization that just the color. But EVERY OTHER CAR alows you to fully customize it with wheels, decals, colors, antennas/flags, toppers, and boost trails.   The newly implemented trading system is very cool too; as you play online games you acquire customizeables and crates which you can trade with other players through an in-game trading system.   The soundtrack is amasing also, you can only listen to music in the main menu, sadly enough.   I know this isn't the best review, but I absolutely love this game, and it is one of the very few favorite games in my library. You honestly will not leave your house very often if you decide to make this purchase.",

Where other games rely on an arbitrary skill ceiling to maintain challenges Rocket League's skill ceiling is a variety of creativity, reaction time, tenacity, deceit, acrobatics, and more. There is truly depth to Rocket League and I can't say that about 80% of the games available today.   The purely aesthetic loot system is wonderful. It made taking the game too seriously difficult and subsequently the edgy bad manners players are less prevalent. Though now the loot system is starting too look all too familiar. Introducing a grinding component to acquiring loot as opposed to more liberally distributing loot. I suppose the hat on my car doesn't actually matter and they haven't touched the core game play but the intention behind implementing a more grind like loot system is step one in creating a market that threatens to consume the rest of the game. The moment options are taken away to stimulate more loot value that thumbs up is turning into a thumbs down and I'll write a new review from my adobe yurt in the Himalayas as the last thing I ever loved was gobbled up by laissez-faire capitalism.",

I've nominated it even, but for my own category of what it is: It's unoriginal. It is a great game to play, with good physics and great to toy around. The idea is so simple it's brilliant. But there were many other games like it that didn't make it. This one did. Do I recommend it, though? Hell yes, it's fun to play. The Devs do a great job at what they do, and the eye candy is nice. There is only one aquatic map that gives my processor some trouble but other than that it's very well optimised. The customability in it is decent, I'd love to see no limitations as to what decals you can add on cars (there are vehicles that can not be customized with visual items from other vehicles).

It's a game that most people will understand before ever starting to play. It's soccer (or hockey, thanks to newer playlist Snow Day) with rocket-boosted RC cars. Play 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, or 4v4. Blow up enemies by boosting directly into them, or don't, if you value sportsmanship over tactics. Your choice.  Eventually, you learn the finer points of flipping off of walls and flying like a witch on a broomstick - but the core game is for all intents and purposes universal. This is one of the few games I do not consider a gamble. If you are even remotely interested, put down the money for it - it is more than worth the asking price.  I recommend playing with a controller as I feel most driving games tend to feel more immersive with triggers for pedals, but do as you like. Lots of customization options make it so that you still have a sense of personality in a team game. DLC is very reasonably priced for how much I get out of the game and is released fairly regularly.  Nothing but love for this game and the devs that made it. When Snow Day playlist was yanked post-holiday season, the developers listened to the public outcry and immediately brought it back. I wish more people were like this.  Games are relatively short and very good for a quick 'pick up and play' type game. Want to kill 10 minutes? Rocket League has you covered. Want to kill 2 hours? That isn't difficult here, either. By virtue of its accessibility, it is easy to revisit this game and pick right back up without getting too rusty, and as such, I find myself constantly returning to this inbetween all the other games I'm trying. I won't be surprsied if I'm logging hours in this forever.",

The game has its derp moments, but the more you play the more you can avoid them or use them in your favor. This game I feel is at least a must-try due to it's unique play and a suprisingly large learning curve. 9.5/10",

I'm not a fan of racing games and the only sports game I've ever really liked was the NHL series. The combination just seems to work on a lot of fundamental levels with Rocket League.   Pros: - TIGHT controls - Challenging in a good way. Very high skill cap - 5 minute matches makes for a quick game to pick up and play for short periods of time - Local, split screen multiplayer! - Server stability  - Competitive or casual play - Multiple modes (hockey, basketball, and others) - Large community due to cross-platform play (PC, PS4, XB1) - The price. Seriously, it's a steal - DLC is cosmetic only** - Excellent selection of cosmetic items to collect, even without buying any DLC - Low system requirements - Large quarterly updates  Cons: - Some players can be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Happens when any community gets large enough. There is a report feature though - Matchmaking can be poor at times, especially for new players - The challenge of learning the car and ball physics may put off some people - If you're going into the matches expecting to win 75% of the time, it's not going to happen. The matchmaking system is good enough to keep you hovering close to 50%.  Summary: I can't recommend this game enough. It's cheap and incredibly fun. I'll be playing this one for years to come.   **The cars from DLC packs have different hitboxes, which only make small differences even at the highest levels of play",

The creativity in the different game modes and maps are also quite appealing as well as a feature to set up your own crazy game however you please. This game is not only incredibly fun for the casual gamer but also for more serious players with how much depth there is into tactics, timing, positioning, accuracy and skill. It is a very rewarding game for those who practice hard too. Also I love that the developers are always releasing the extra game modes or new maps for free which is a huge plus and doesn't split player base or leave casual players behind if they thought that maps/game modes as paid DLC were not worth their money and time.",

            "review_text": "Rocket League is a vehicular soccer video game developed and published by Psyonix. This game is based on you driving a vehicle. More importantly, a car. This car is your car. Fully customizable from colours to patterns. You have control over 100+ customizations from wheels, vehicles and colours with certain special items within crates to choose from to make your vehicle look astonashing kicking goals for the team. Not only that, when you win, your car is in a winner's circle for everyone to see.  You have a small amount of items when you start, but do not worry. You earn rewards after every round online, or offline. Even if you lose constantly, you still get a reward after the game, so you won't miss out on the customization goodness.  The movement is what makes this game amazing. Your vehicle has the ability to jump twice in mid-air while having a main booster rocket on the back of your vehicle. You can use this ability to advance on the ball to center, defend or attack goals. Team work is key in this game and you and your team MUST tell each other which one is defending and what vehicles are attacking. If the whole team was attacking, that will leave your goal defencless, which no one wants.  I recommend making friends in the game, making a team and working together, with stratigies and tactics in order to be the ultimate team of Rocket League!  The game runs well with lack of bugs, however i have had experience with glitches in Rumble Mode withlist having multiple items used on the ball at once, which caused it to spaz out uncontrolably.  I recommend this game highly for people wanting a challange and i do NOT recommend for people that get angry easily. I give it a 10/10",

There is no ♥♥♥♥♥♥ RNG, no stupid powerups, no weapon loadouts, no pay-to-win nonsense. Every player gets a similarly handling vehicle, and there is collectible boost on the stages. That's it. The only thing seperating players is their skill level. The various techniques are nothing but an application of the resources available to all.

It is well worth the money and the DLC is very reasonably priced, especially with the 2 car packs. Even though I only got the game last night I'm already considering getting the DLC, this game is a MASTERPIECE. But, with all things beautiful, the internet kills it. But this time literally. The servers at the moment are terribly plagued with rubber banding. This effects the game A LOT when playing online. My ping is at a constant 20-40 yet I get pretty bad rubber banding. The worst thing is, it's the console's fault. Ever since there was crossplay the servers went to s**t. If this carries on, it may affect my score more than it does already.  Anyway, overall I give this game a 9/10 on it's own without the server problem and 7/10 with the server problem.  Scoring System",

Graphics- 9 Though a arcade like game the graphics are pretty nice and gloomy. The paint glistens and the grass looks realistic  Sound- 9 From ball sounds to the boom! that you hear when you blow up your advesary  Sound seems well polished along with a pretty decent soundtrack  Gameplay- 9 Blowing up foes and barrel roll goals feel so rewarding and addictive. Realistic ball physics help set up amazing shots. Difficult at times but never to the point where you want to quit. Such a rewarding game  Overall- 9  You'll get on for a few games and end up playing for hours on end. A great game to play with friends or alone. From friendly games against/with friends to fun ranked play. Rocket league is a must add to any steam owners game list. I mean, combining soccer and RC cars? What a genius idea for a game right!?",

Pitting teams of 2 to 4 vehicles against eachother think of this as NASCAR meets futbol meets Burnout. There's not a lot to say about this game that hasn't already been said. Teams start on their side of the field and try to knock the ball into the opposing teams goal using their car. Sounds boring, but you'll soon see these are not your average cars. They are aerodynamic death machines with the ability to double jump. Yes, the cars jump - and it is fantastic.  I picked this up for $9.99 but I highly reccomend it even at it's full $19.99 price tag - this is easily a $29.99+ title.  My only gripe with the game is I prefer a mouse and keyboard and this game simply doesn't support M+KB if you want to do arial manuvers.

And even when the game released, only some pple where talking and that too barely. So i was like lemme just watch a gameplay and then lets judge this game( U cant judge a book by its cover)so i searched up rocket league and the first video was from that dude called 'JELLY' pretty popular. Man! when i saw it i was laughing cause of its silliness but then i saw video on the'reccomended for you'side which was from rocket league cinema, Those plays looked so awesome, those aerials, pinch shots, pools, mid air passes , freestyles.... man!

If you are playing with friends then you are good, but competitive might as well be a roll of a dice to decide if you win the game. My advice is either buy the game knowing that 50% is up to luck, either your side or the oponents, or play just with friends and not any compeitive game modes because they are truely a 100% waste of time.

This would be fine if the AI acted like a normal player. The problem is, players are very inaccurate and programmed inaccuracy can never be equal to the inaccuracies of human error. As a result, the AI is either overpowered or terrible. I was playing a game and we scored in the first thirty seconds or so. A player on the enemy team left. The AI who replaced it proceeded to score five goals by the end of the game with it's teamates scoring zero goals and it blocking essentially every shot we took.

Enter a 3 v 3 RANKED match... let's say the opposing team scores within 30 seconds. I can GUARANTEE one of your teammates will leave before the replay of the goal is even finished. No one will come in to fill their spot. Your team will most likely lose at this point.  'OK', I originally thought, 'He's getting his comeuppance. He'll be deranked quickly if he keeps that ♥♥♥♥ up.' Yet i've played match after match, again and again, regardless of if its my team scoring first or theirs. Someone will always quit. 'can't be worse than this' I reason.  oh but it can. It really can.  Wait until TWO opponents/teammates leave. 1 vs 3.. within the first 60 seconds of a RANKED game that lasts for 5 minutes. It's not fun for either side.  So, I thought 'OK, 2 v 2 must be pretty intense then. At least in 3 v 3 you have a (slight) chance of still winning if one of your teammates ♥♥♥♥♥es out. They must have more respect in a 2 v 2 then, right?' Nope.  2 v 2 is even worse.  I've had to play MANY 1 v 2 games. It's horrible. Why even create the 'RANKED' gameplay if there is no punishment for quitting a match early? There's no loss in your overall 'rank'! The worst part... I've started quitting ranked matches myself because I let an easy save into the goal, or maybe I missed an easy goal. Why do I care if I quit? Why SHOULD I care? I don't. I can save myself time by quitting right now without any consequences.  It's cancer. It really is. The game should implement something like CS:GO where you are banned for X amount of time each match you quit. I've always, ALWAYS, hated people who did this type of ♥♥♥♥ in any game.. yet here I am, slowly realizing that 'My team WILL lose, so why waste my time attempting to win? I got better things to do.' so I'll quit the match.  It's not a good culture to breed your game into.",

One thing I've enjoyed in particular about this title is it's superb sound design. You'll hear the audience in the giant rocket-soccer stadiums cheer when you make goals, gasp at great saves, and yell in shock when you destroy another player. Barely perceptible vu vu zella's mixed in with crowd noise, that awesome train horn when you score a goal, that relieving tone when you pull off epic goal defense, every aspect of this game's sound design really adds a layer of polish that makes this game shine (assuming you can hear something shine, that is).  The above, and many more things, have made Rocket League my favorite title of 2015 so far.",

The testosterone levels in this product is absolutely crazy. For a game that focuses on that, you gotta be able to retain the attention of the audience who plays it, and boy does it capture it. Multiplayer is a blast, when the servers are up however, but the developers are working on fixing it and are very communicative on social media.  Cross platform play for PC and PS4 is even better, however it is only limited by the fact that you have to go through matchmaking and get lucky if you get paired up with a buddy of yours on PS4. HOWEVER, the devs have stated that they are working on a solution to at least allow PC peeps to invite PS4 peeps into private matches, and hopefully down the line, maybe have parties that go into match making. Should this go through, this game will be even more praiseworthy in the sense that it allows for such cross-platform play.   My concern for this is the content. Most the maps are the same, but with free map DLC's coming out, it should be fixed. Maybe different map layouts might be a thing, for that will allow different strategies and tactics. Car customization is nice, but it is only cosmetic, and I feel like that is the case so it is an even playing field for everyone. Special abilities could make it into the game, but that runs the risk of balancing and complexifying a game that is supposed to be focused on one thing - fun.   Who knows how this will play out in the future, but for now, Rocket League is an outstanding product. Split screen multiplayer, especially on PC, is a rarity and for Rocket League to include it will only introduce hours of rage filled fun with all my buds and family. For $20, it's worth every penny to me. It is a fun game, i enjoy every bit of it. It keeps me on my toes(or the edge of the seat, realistically) and just makes me look forward to the next round. Buy it and spread the word. If you have friends on PS4, tell them to get it, since most of those guys have Playstation Plus, and it is free for July.  Word of Advice to all you guys out there who have the game or who bought it - Communicate. Figure out the keybindings for voice chatting or the quick text chat. Communicate with your team. Laugh, Scream, do whatever(well almost everything). It will make the game even more frantic and fun. I hope I'll see yall out there. If you guys see me in your games, just give me a shout out and talk! I love a good convo or communication with my teammates! Make friends on this game! Most of all, have fun.",

Great DLC  In the spirit of my initial negative review, here are Issues that still exist:  - PC players and PS4 players still can't commmunicate, but they added a filter so that you can avoid playing with random PS4 players altogether - Voice chat in game is pretty useless..as you can only alltalk - Still no point in the ranks that show up - Still capped at 60fps. You change a config file to turn it up to 120, but it causes a problem with the free camera mode while your car is in the air. I have it turned to 120fps because I use ballcam most of the time, except when chasing down boosts.",

Well, maybe not much, but if this review happens to help someone out there, I'll be happy! :)  First off, even though the game is quite competitive, you can still play casual matches that are are nearly identical to their ranked/competitive counterparts, which I find to be very catering to a casual player as opposed to a game like CS:GO which has a casual mode that differs quite a bit from actual 'competitive' matches. So if start off playing Rocket League casually, and later want to play ranked games, it is very easy to do so.  The second point is that there is so much depth and potential to the movement mechanics in the game, many of which you have probably seen on YouTube on some crazy, 'Goal Compilation'. This creates a very high skill ceiling for the competive player. Rocket League is a game that is easy to pick up, but takes lots of time to master.  There are many other points about the game such it's custimization, local multiplayer, mutators, different arenas and more that I won't mention here because many other people have gone more in depth in them.  However if you play the game either casually or competitively, I HIGHLY recommend that you purchase a Xbox or PS4 controller for the game, it makes the controls feel a lot better then using a mouse and keyboard, and I believe it can help you play a little better as well. However this will cost you a bit extra, but I would encourage you to envest in it. If you are on a budget and can't afford a controller, a mouse and keyboard will suit you just fine.  In conclusion, if you enjoy a fun, almost arcade feeling, short round based (competitive) game, then I believe that you should give Rocket League a try!",

Your objective is to get the ball to the enemy's goal under 5 min using car, just like a soccer game but with car. Sound simple, but hard to master. As the play require skill and in depth understanding of how game mechanic work. You have to use advanced technique such as aeriel manuever, boost management, juggling and many amazing play that you can muster.  You can choose from 1vs 1, 2vs 2 ,3vs3, or 4vs4. Ranked match, private lobby, pub , and local play is possible. And the best thing, local play support splitscreen! Want to have fun in one monitor? No problem! Up to 4 player possible and 8 player can join through LAN. Customization lie solely on cosmetic and each car have no different in ability, so they are balanced by the fact each player have to play with similar limit. The difference s only the hitbox of different car. So, player skill play a major role here.  With a lot of achievement, trophy, EXP based level up, stat,and leaderboard, this game bring high replayability value and 'bragging right' among player and friends. You can exchange stat and be proud of your 'MAD SKILLZ'. just 3 days after release the competitive scene have an eye on the game.   Esport  [play.eslgaming.com]  now plan to establish rocket league cups on August. IMO this is deserved because there is high competitive value with depth gameplay lie on the game. Example for pro play can be seen here:  Link   [www.twitch.tv]  This game also released on PS4 and available for free for PS+ user this month. So get em! Currently cross-platform support is being developed on the way. So expect more player to come when it is finished. The only problem this game has is server issue due to server overload. More than 10, 000 player concurrently with limited server capacity due to dev budget make the server down a commonplace. Expect it to fixed later this year. All in all. This game is fun in purest form that you can't expect with any game nowsaday. Buy this game with friends now!",

The party system. You can have a party, but you can only play ranked with 1 other person for 2v2's. The only other ranked gametypes are for solo play, and they are 1v1-2v2-3v3 I believe they should allow parties to play anything from 2v2-4v4 RANKED. Exhibition can get pretty darn easy, so allowing the ranked increase will make this game 10x better  i have dual graphics, however i havnt had any issues with that. there is very minor server issues, but i really don't think it's the servers, i think it's the people Queing up. I've always been low ping in this game, however i see and vs people at like 160 ping constantly, and that creates skippy game play.",

This is just my personal opinion but I think it would make the game much better for all.  First I would take out the ability to 'fly'. I get it, it's pretty, and it does take some skill to do, but the problem is there are a lot of players who prefer keyboard and mouse, like myself. Using this ability is much harder on keyboard and mouse than it is on controller, giving those using controller and proficient with it an advantage. Just a thought, I think it's not really needed in a futbol game.  Then I would make demolition 'kills' last longer. Not too long, but right now there is no real benefit to demolishing an opponent, they spawn rather quickly and of no consequence. Either don't allow it or make it have some kind of consequence, make players have to keep their eye open for possible incoming in hopes of avoiding it. The only time it really benefits you is when you hit the goalie and the ball is already right on their goal.  Otherwise a super fun game. So far I've only played a few hours of it. Mostly playing Ranked right now, reached Silver so far in standard 3v3. I definitely reccomend it even with the things I would change.",

The game is simple, you have multiple amounts (1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4) of players that battle eachother with rocketpowered toy cars and try to get the ball in the opponent's goal. Sounds pretty simple, and that's Rocket League's strength.. AT FIRST.  You start out with equal ranked players, unless you have more experienced players in your party, and you start the basics. Jumping, Double Jumping, Defending, Trying to ACTUALLY hit that ball without looking like a 'noob', etc.  The more matches you play, the more experienced players you encounter (granted, there's high-level players who are ♥♥♥♥ at the game too), the more awesome goals you'll see happening.  Hovering, Learning how to play with your team.. That's the harder part.   You can design your own cars with the unlockable stickers/decals/styles/hats/trails/.. and that's fine. You can choose how you look in this game, but there's some actual restrictions (you'll find out).   Do I recommend this game? Yes! Is it unplayable without controller? For me, it is.. Do you need to buy DLC for it? Not really, it's all about your personal choice. Stadiums are free. Is it better on PC or PS4?

I had no intention of ever even looking at the game. I was bored one day and figured I'd try it....  Man... Oh man... What did I do to myself?  This game is fantastic. I wouldn't have been able to tell you that by looking at it or watching other people play it, it's just an experience. The game is surprisingly fun, and it is super super SUUUUPER hard! I'm usually good with this sort of game(Games that require manipulation of projectiles). This game just sort of throws you for a loop though, learning where to hit the ball and how to hit the ball and how to choose when to double jump or jump and flip... There's a lot to this simple game. Working the camera is as much a skill as actually hitting the ball and making it go where you want it to go. The players that are actually good at the game stand far apart from the players that aren't. You can pick them out of the crowd like sore thumbs. The way they manipulate the ball is like an elaborate dance compared to the way newer players thrash and flail against the balls like uncoordinated children.   This is the sort of game that you can expect to, when putting in the effort, grow exponetially and actually make a difference for your 3 man team. Go reap some glory! Feel the exhiliration as you knock that ball perfectly into that net (or inversely feel the shame you experience upon missing that clutch goal block).",

Unfortunately theres cons, they removed some great stuff from SRPABC, but can be patched:  - No Auto-goals (theres lots of people who deserve humilation award )   - Reward medals at the end of each game. The only award avaible is the MVP award  they removed best wingman, goal keeper , and more... (its always good to have a shelf full of awards) medals can improve moral and performance. its scietific fact   - All the maps have the same format, the previous game had funny maps. i would like to see this in a patch some day but i dont know if its possible. the old maps are great.   i think its all i dont remember any more details, have fun.",

Plus, you can just jump online, play a five-minute match and get out. Great for when you have an hour or two to kill.   The servers were a bit laggy after launch, but this has been largely resolved. When it comes to multinational servers, there are always improvements to be made, but Rocket League has tidied itself up quite nicely. The online ranking system could have been deeper, but it gets the job done. After a while, it becomes addicting to see your ranking points increase or decrease after every match, urging you to play another quick game to compensate for that one loss or keep the winning streak going.  In short, Rocket League is a nice little game, with a simple and fun formula, but also a game that gives you all the tools to develop your own playing style. Not one match you play will ever be the same. Grab a couple friends and start playing right now.",

This is truly a game that you can start playing and have tons of fun without spending hours researching meta and watching streamers' tutorials.The built-in tutorials are useful, the graphics are pretty, and the cross-platform options are nice.

If you have $20 in your wallet, please buy this game. The graphics are easy too run, too. The online is user-friendly and connects well. Season mode is everything I had hoped for minus just a few things I'd like. Rocket League is also availible on Xbox One and PS4 so if you'd rather have it on console, pick it up there.",

The one and only problem has been playing with PS4-players. Not because that they would be annoying (they aren't, really), but because it's not possible to create a party where both PC- and PS4-players could join. So, dear creators of Rocket League, could you possibly add something like a 'Join Party' -option in the next update, and with that option the players from different devices could join eachother's parties with a party number or something like that, so it would be possible to play in online matches together. Besides that, I would rate this game 5/5 because of the insane action, great graphics and gameplay, and because of having fun with friends in a way that can't be reached in real life social occasions.  Please, buy this game. It's worth trying (and getting addicted to) ;)  (sry 4 bad Engles)",

I got that, but I also thought that it would be really boring and would be a game trend that fades away quickly. That's one reason I was hesitating to buy this. I waited until it was $13.99 on sale and I bought it. The graphics are AMAZING for an indie game, the gameplay (even the singleplayer which I play a lot) is very smooth and fun to play. So far the community that I've met is very friendly and are never poor sports. I really like all the customization options you have and that you can have antennas that are video game and company based (VAULT BOY WOOT). As a child I used to play a lot of racing games like Project Gotham Racing for the 1st Xbox and I can just tell that if I were a kid (not a squid), I would love this game even more than I do now. (NOTE: I recommend playing with a controller because it's much easier to play with. I use the Xbox One controller when I play. Oh and the keys are all able to be remapped.) This is the first review where I've actually written over 6 sentences. I rate this game 10/10.  July 4th Edit: Okay I'm coming back late July 4th to revise my review. I now have 54 hours and I have become addicted to this game again. I've learned the ways of double jumping and predicting people's actions and I'm now practicing aerials. I'm level 27 and I can say that this game is still very fun when you get competitive at it. Now, I am not the best level 27, but it's still fun to play. Also, playing this game with friends is very fun (WHEN THEY PLAY WITH YOU), and it can be very funny at times, and very, very salty. You may say things you don't mean, too... (like I'M NEVER PLAYING COMPETITIVE WITH YOU AGAIN, YOU SCORED TWICE ON OUR OWN GOAL!) It's all fun.  I do really recommend this game, but remember: it's easy to start playing but very, VERY hard to master.",

AMD cards in particular seem to have gotten the ♥♥♥♥ end of the stick as it has crashed in BSOD fashion multiple times until I physically edited a pair of .sys files, their leading suggestion in the psyonix forums for how to overcome the BSODs is not to use an AMD gpu.

Just the idea of cars driving around, boosting, flying to score a goal is a fantastic concept. I have put 350 hours into this game and I still am not near the top ranks. I am around the middle.  Pros: Easy to pick up. Hard to master. Flying cars. Many, many cars to chose from. You can customise these cars with antennas, toppers, paint jobs and even decals. It is a fantastic eSport to watch. Montages look amazing. Many DLC's to come. Did I mention flying cars?   Cons: If you do not have a controller, this game can be a nightmare to learn. You can get extremely ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off if you solo in ranked. The community can be highly toxic so just let it sink in. They are adding micro-transactions in the future though I do not know what for. All DLC is not free, but pretty cheap.  Overall, my Cons are just some personal things I do not like but don't let it put you off this game.

They seem to not want to open up more Ranked areas. We need ranked areas for special maps, hockey and basketball. This would be Zero cost to the developer and a world of gain but the completely ignore us. 2.) Wasteland is the crappiest map ever made. Why force us to play it in Ranked? Make a new Ranked that lets people play the way they want to play. 3.) Lag, your servers need reset or something more often. 4.) Map rotation, How hard is it to add a check to see if I've been stuck playing wasteland 4-5 times in a row? Pretty hard I guess. 5.) Listen to your audience, quit forcing things down our throats. There are 18,000 players. There is no reason to force all players to play all maps. Give us a clean competitive Ranked mode and a custom fun ranked mode. I'd play both! I really would! but GEEZZ let US choose.  Pros: It never gets old, infinite fun and I pretty much play every day.",

Nobody likes Neo Tokyo in the first place, I believe that it is the worst map in the game. Well, aside from Aquadome (For some people).   For most people (excluding me) Aquadome causes some issues for some players. Mainly the frame rate. This is a big issue for most players, and only some can play on maximum settings. Obviously every person isn't going to have a $2,000 gaming PC, BUT, I believe they could better optimize the game. Or, dumb down the maps that make people's games lag.

I know a lot of people hated Wasteland when it was added, which I didn't mind - then they added the underwater one and my underpowered PC's fps dipped quite a bit. Around the same time my fps nearly crashed when using my mic and even sometimes when another player uses their's which it had never done before. It occasionally still happens, but seemingly less often - either that or I am used to it and have come to expect it.  The game is still amazing and the most-played game in my Steam library, I just hope they add more customization to how players can control what maps are in the rotation - maybe add a voting system if the upcoming pitch has however many dislikes so players can vote to skip (always skipping to one without any dislikes or the fewest dislikes if all have someone disliking)",

The contact between cars is a little exagerated and really annoying but if this game had the same physical as The Next Car Game: Wreckfest, then these games wouldn't last as much as some of these games go. (5 min regulation and 5 min OT) Now that I think about it, that would be an entertaining version to this game: Demolition Derby Soccer? I would buy that. Now for the Devs, could we maybe get a GhostBusters vehicle? That would be nice.  Now, for the maps, there are a few that are recylced throught the game with minimal differences between the number of players on the field. There are 3 other game modes that I don't play often but get have a lot of fun with. They are: SnowDay (with a hockey puck instead of a soccerball), Hoops (basketball, involves a lot of well timed jumps and damn good aim), and Rocket Lab (this is where you play real working copies of maps and modes that the Devs include with updates.

You'll probably fumble a lot trying to hit the ball at all let alone accurately.   The great thing about this game though, is that it's always fun, even if you suck. Playing the game with friends is highly recommended too as it absolutely doubles the fun, and I really like how matchmaking takes parties into account to assure you'll be on the same team as your friends in online play.  The one thing that I'll complain about is that the AI can still do really dumb things, even if you're playing at higher skill levels I have seen some bots just casually drive the ball into their own goal for no reason. It can be quite frustrating to play offline if you're essentially carrying your team.  I should also mention, that if you're ever starting to get bored of the standard arenas, I highly recommend you try some of the rocket lab arenas to completely change things up. It seems right now that not many people play on them but I promise you they are worth it and demand a whole new strategy and style of play.",

Bought it about a year or year and a half ago and did not have any hiatus longer than a day or two.   + teaches you self control. After a time you understand you have to take a break after few lost games in a row. This game is about 70% about psyche, its about how concentrated and how chill you are. The second you become frustrated and ♥♥♥♥♥♥, you lose concentration, you lose the game.  - enormously stupid community of people. Seriously, you have never met bigger number of a-holes until you played rocket league. Community 2/10 - meaning you meet about two fine people out of 10. The rest is not just mean. They are the biggest bunch of 12 y.o. spoiled brats laughing in your face constantly.   -aquadome map (needlessly detailed, brings fps down)  overall: 9/10 - because you can turn off the chat. If you are a nice person, buy it. If you have high self esteem and if you are arogant, go grow up an then when you behave properly, buy the game and enjoy.",

This game mixes cars with rockets and a number of different sports. There is hockey, soccer(or football) and basketball at the moment and there is also some different stuff such as a test lab which is a odd mode to say the least along with different amounts of players for certain modes and even competitive leagues. The game also offers many servers throughout the world allowing for most people to stay under 100 ping for more fluid gameplay or making it easy to play with friends without having to worry as much if they are a bit far away. This game has an amazing soundtrack and truely looks and feels great. The game may be fun for people who like sports but want to see a twist on it. This game also is friendly to beginners and offers a gradual learning curve. I personally don't play this game often due to it getting a little bit boring if you play it over an hour or two at a time. I would still recommend this game due to the low pricetag, fun gameplay and the amount of stuff to do. Overall I myself give this game an 8 out of 10.",

Pros in my opinion: -has a lot of multiplayer modes (3v3 is my fav) -cuztomizable cars  -there is a competitive mode  Cons: -Ping mostly 200+ no matter what Region I try, in other games I get nearly 30 ping. -You will play with some pros or semi pros even as a rookie -The region system automatically sets on different locations  where your ping is really bad if you don't find a match within 2 minutes",

Compared to the top players I'm complete trash, but I know I'll keep practising until I reach the level I'm fine with.

There are also options of 2v2, 4v4 and other unconventional modes such as Hoops and asymmetric futbol maps.  This game has a very high skill ceiling but is easily accessible to the pleb gamer like myself, and a lot of nuance behind what is essentially a very simple premise: score goals. When you screw up, it's pretty obvious that it's your own fault and the game isn't unfair on that front.   The music in menus are a very small part of the experience, but is quite chill nonetheless.  Psyonix also knows how to do good DLC. The entirety of it is purely aesthetic in nature, and there are plenty of free updates so none of the playing content is locked behind a paywall. The packages are small, morsel-like bites of additional customisation for your car, and as at 15/05/2016, I own 1 DLC currently.  Speaking of customisation, there are extensive options for paint jobs, decals, wheels, antennae, toppers, boosts which helps keep the aesthetics of the game fresh.  I am absolute dogshit at the game, but it is fun in its own merit and would definitely recommend this game, though it must be noted that the majority of my playtime has been with mates over Skype, so YMMV.",

This is a phenomenal game to play at all ages and appeals to every genre. I've detested racing games or anything related to a sport, but after enough peer pressure and I've already sunk a respectable amount of hours into it. It works as a pick-up-and-play because of its short time spans in each game - 5 minutes. You can play up to 4 cars a side, and it now has hockey and basketball types. Worthwhile content is free, but you pay extra for cosmetic cars and decals.

Fast forward to around a few days ago at the time of this review, when Rocket League became free-to-play to all for a limited time because of the NBA, I believe... Anyway, of course, I quickly downloaded the game, and what a shocker, I was terrible first time around when playing against bots. I was using a mouse and keyboard the first time around (noob, I know, as many from where I went have said that controller is the master race), then quickly realised my grave mistake and switched them up with an old Xbox 360 controller I had lying around.  I quickly learned the basics of the controls thanks to the tutorial, as well as getting used to the new control setup with the controller, and jumped straight into a few online matches. To my surprise, I did pretty well the first couple of times. Sure, there were ♥♥♥♥-ups here and there, but I don't think it was along the lines of, 'OMG! Wow! Stop playing this now!' Also, fyi, I LOVE the little text thingies you can spam to everybody, those are fun as hell.  After playing for the few days that it was avaliable, I spent around 16 hours on it, which I believe is the longest I've spend on a game in one go without playing another in between, which is a huge achievement on my part. During that time, I was absolutely begging myself to take the £8.99 deal it had during this current time, and here I am writing this review just minutes after using my parents' money to buy this game.  All I have to say is that you will LOVE this game, even if you don't like sports games, because it's extremely fun, and I definitely plan on playing this for much longer than just 16 hours...  10/10",

            "review_text": "I've only managed to find a few small flaws with the game; one of them is that some cars are just not as good as others if you factor hitbox, (boosted) turnrate and handbrake-turn-speed into your considerations- there are clear best cars, and always will be, but some of the ones that are lacking could probably be fairly easily brought up to par (with minor buffs to the aforementioned attributes). I'm sure they'll sort it out as they see fit. All of them are viable, some just a lot more so than others.  As a second flaw, there seem to be some weird issues surrounding USB devices with no clear solution. Even original xbox controllers disconnecting and then reconnecting randomly, the left stick suddenly not working in menus, stuff like that which seems to be related to other USB devices connected to the system, but a game-flaw nevertheless.  The soundtrack is pretty garbo imo, interchangeable radio tunes. Lots of people like it and that's the point, so who am I to disagree? I just turned it off.  Addictive as ♥♥♥♥, virtually limitless skill-ceiling from what I have seen, my only regret is that I waited this long to get the game. My thumbs hurt.",

A penality in normal games to if a player leave to many games.  The microtransactions between the cars to you can buy is both good and bad cause in the start they would add more than one car to each pack now they just stick with one and to get 2 cars as you did before now cost 5,97€ where before it would cost 3,99€ + new maps included.  Some players that are to competitve and start raging over mistakes (i know this isn't Rocket League in general but overall all games)  But i recommend buying the game if you got some to play with (atleast 1 friend so you can play 2v2 or 2 friends so you can play 3v3 since that will get you away from the more leaving players, and yes theres ALOT of players leaving the game when the oponnents score the first goal and it says 1-0)",

Let's start from the beggining, simple idea: cars and balls. Ok it's fun, but let's add some more: jumps and turbo. BOOM! Now it's crazy, fast, vertical, horizontal, diagonal and madness all around. Moreover, adding with thate a nice set of precise controls, most of the time, and some very neat visuals and graphics you have one of the most wonderful sports-game like experiencies.   What mesmerized me about this game is the feeling of control you have over the car, once you learn the basics and start trying to do the fancy things (flying, walls, ball control, plays, backwards, etc) you start to really appreciate how many oportunities you have to move around and play the different modes.  Regarding the modes, once you got this wonderful system, you complete it with different play styles, different cars, locations and customizations and you just make it more easy for people to enjoy it. Take for instance the hoops update, you leanred how to play and fly in the big pitch of the usual modes and you now have to control every bounce and rebound from every corner to defend or attack the hoop, the rules change and your game has to adapt to them. Another example is the rocket labs modes, just by adding different levels or different goals you game has to change and adapt, and you discover new ways to control your car to do so.  Finally, another nice point is that it's a game you buy, for a pretty reasonable price, and you get all the contents and updates for free, having only to pay for some extra cars if you really want to have them (or the NBA flags that's for sure) but you don't have to constantly pay dlcs and updates to play the new modes or scenarios. You just pay for the visual customs. However, the new key box system, taken from other games like this, is not really good for us usual players, as we don't want to keep paying for keys all the time to get new items, this should be rethought in my opinion.  A game that keeps udating, surprising and making us enjoy ourselves to the maximum, that's Rocket League.  ",

As of writing this, I've owned Rocket League for... Maybe two... Three full days. I have 3.5 hours in it. I've done two sessions, both being 1v1 against a friend. Before I got this game, I was highly skeptical. I don't like football/soccer, never have, never will. Cars are cool, but I'm not a fan of driving games.  But somehow, I enjoy this. I really enjoy this.  And I hate that I enjoy this.   It's fun, both as a serious game and as a little timewaster. It's fun if you don't enjoy football. It's fun if you don't enjoy driving games. It's fun if you don't like sport. It's fun. It's just really fun.  There is a... Nitpicky issue, perhaps?  It struggles to run on my Mac. Yeah, I know, owning a Mac is a sin blah blah blah-- Whatever. My point is, my graphics settings are all Performance/High Performance, and I always get huge lag spikes, especially at the start of the game. It's playable, sure, but I'd rather not see everything in Minecraft mode, y'know? I'm sure the cars look real nice and all, but when I can't tell the colour of my opponent from the colour of the walls - both because I'm partially colourblind, and because of the graphics - that can be quite a problem.   Besides that, it's good. Really good. Worth the £15. And it's on sale. Definitely worth it.",

How fun can it really be to play soccer with rocket-powered battle-cars?  Well, I must say that it is very much fun. The mission is simple: you control a car, either alone or with teammates. You maneuver the car in any way you would like, in order to ultimately push the ball inside the opponent's goal. The whole stadium is at your disposal. Climb the walls to hit the ball in a difficult-to-read angle, use your rocket engine in order to aim for the sky and beat your opponent to the ball.  The mission is simple. But yet so complex. This is not a game that you will get the hang of within the first minutes. It will take some practice, and even after you feel like the basics are in place, there are a lot of room for improving. The skill gap is huge, which allows for all types of players to have fun, both casual and competitive.  Give Rocket League a try and you will not regret.",

Had a bad day at the office? Come home and play some Rocket League to relax. Getting battered by EAids on FIFA? Play some Rocket League to remember why you play games, for enjoyment. Not playing well? It's alright, most teammates will be very understanding and there are quite a few who will offer you tips on how to improve!  - You don't have to be good to enjoy it. I've played almost 50 hours on this wonderful piece of art and must admit I'm still pretty bad. I can't aerial to save my life and am an awful goalie.

The creativity in the different game modes and maps are also quite appealing as well as a feature to set up your own crazy game however you please. This game is not only incredibly fun for the casual gamer but also for more serious players with how much depth there is into tactics, timing, positioning, accuracy and skill. It is a very rewarding game for those who practice hard too. Also I love that the developers are always releasing the extra game modes or new maps for free which is a huge plus and doesn't split player base or leave casual players behind if they thought that maps/game modes as paid DLC were not worth their money and time.",

This is because Rocket League is the most similar to real life sports and is more accesible for everyone. The game is easy to learn so anyone can enjoy but very difficult to master. The simiarities to soccer and the crazy unpredictable physics engine make the game almost as fun to watch as it is to play. Watching the RLCS is especially enjoyable as seeing crazy pro players pull off epic tricks is quite entertaining.   If you're interested in a competitive sports game Rocket League should be your first choice. Its not a simulator like FIFA and there aren't as many try hards as in other competitive games. Rocket League is an awesome, unique sports game that can be easygoing or very competitive. Its a great choice for anybody.",

At that point I had never played RL and now that I've sunk in over 500 hours and over 1,000 games I can say it truly is game of the year.  On the surface level it appears as one of those games that's a fad, it would fade out over a year or two but after actually experiencing it I have high hopes for the future of this game.  Every game offers something new, the amount of time and effort you put into the game really reflects your performance.  Hats/Trails/Decals/Etc are really fun and offer you a way to personalize your experience.  The training really teaches you every thing from the basics to a low end competetive level of play (also I've noticed it is quite useful to practice in)  The free roam training is great, especially if you want to practice freestyles or work on your wall play.  Overall, Rocket League is honestly one of the best and most fun games I've played in a long time, sometimes the servers are an issue but those occurances are rare.  9.5/10",

Runs great with plenty of options and inputs -So much content for the price. -Well-paced progression that involves some awesome goodies to unlock -It has microtransactions but everything is cosmetic. -Controls and plays like a dream -Gameplay itself is very deep, with many different ways to play and amazing stuff you can pull off -Perfect mix of casual and competitive play -Local Co-op is a big plus! -Graphically beautiful   NEUTRAL  -Soundtrack is alright, in my opinion. It's a bit too electronic for me but it's not anything unpleasant. --Community can be a**holes occasionally but are mostly pleasant, like any game community, really.   CONS  -No custom/community server browser. -Competitive (while very fun) isn't as fleshed out as it could be.    CONCLUSION    A must buy for anyone even remotely interested in any multiplayer games at all. Great fun for gamers of ALL ages, both casually and competitively.

            "review_text": "If you're looking for a game that's quick and casual, but equally competitive and adrenaline-boosting in its style of gameplay, then Rocket League is definitely a game for you to add to your collection.  When first seeing Rocket League in the Top Seller charts, I at first thought that it was just a simple game involving race cars playing soccer. It figuratively didn't exactly sound entertaining in my mind. Then, after deciding to just buy it and try it out, I realized I was completely wrong and did not waste a single penny on the game.  Rocket League is jam-packed with competition and action. When you play a single match, you'll be so involved in the game that you might not even realize the amount of time that's passed when you play over 5 matches and 30 minutes of your free time just disappeared. The controls in Rocket League are extremely compatible with the human brain, so picking the game up and mastering it is possible for anybody, heroically lifting the heavy burden of people needing to be experienced racing gamers in order to have fun in Rocket League.  What's the greatest about Rocket League is the feeling it gives you when you play a match. When you try it out for the first time, you actually don't feel like an insignificant player who's just filling up another slot in a team-composition game. You feel focused, and you have motivation to try your best as well as practice to get even better. It's true that at first you feel that the ball is untouchable to you and that you can't really do anything besides punt it in the air when all the other players are stuck to each other like glue, but the game makes it entirely possible for anyone to skillfully rise from that level and eventually become a flying superstar that backflips 20 feet in the air in order to score a goal. What's the best about this game is how it frustrates the player; rather than making the player yell out of pure anger, which eventually boils into hatred for the game itself, Rocket League makes players feel frustration that rather motivates them to learn from their mistakes and think about how they can do better. The feeling of failure as well as the fear of it is not a drawback of this game at all, which is what makes this game such a successful product for casual and competitive players alike. No matter what, you won't exit Rocket League feeling worse than you did before you opened it.  The only drawback in the game, however, is its matchup system. While the game itself has a quick matchmaking system that hardly ever tries the player's patience, it can be a little rough for those who are playing for the first time. Sometimes, a new player will be matched against other gamers who have accumulated skill that flies into a league completely out of the newbie's reach, which as a result turns the game into a full-fledged 2v2 with the two remaining players struggling to just keep up with the ball. The new players can learn from the pros in this sense and raise their skill cap substantially, as well as witness the endless potential Rocket League has in store when they see sick plays and jumps made by the more experienced players, but it doesn't nullify the fact that not everyone has equal grounding on the playing field. Eventually, though, the playing field does gradually beome leveled, and when the newbie who jumps for no reason turns into a champion who can barrel roll into a flying ball at a different trajectory and score a goal, the feeling of achievement in accomplishing such a feat is just amazing.  Rocket League is suited as one of the best casual multiplayer-sport-arcade games you can have on your Steam account, and I expect that it will stay that way for a long time. But, that's just my opinion. What would be yours?",

They've brought in extra modes for free, free car addons, free cosmetic skins and free maps! There is some paid dlc, but it's all cosmetic, so, there's no pay-to-win here!

            "review_text": "If you're looking for a game that's quick and casual, but equally competitive and adrenaline-boosting in its style of gameplay, then Rocket League is definitely a game for you to add to your collection.  When first seeing Rocket League in the Top Seller charts, I at first thought that it was just a simple game involving race cars playing soccer. It figuratively didn't exactly sound entertaining in my mind. Then, after deciding to just buy it and try it out, I realized I was completely wrong and did not waste a single penny on the game.  Rocket League is jam-packed with competition and action. When you play a single match, you'll be so involved in the game that you might not even realize the amount of time that's passed when you play over 5 matches and 30 minutes of your free time just disappeared. The controls in Rocket League are extremely compatible with the human brain, so picking the game up and mastering it is possible for anybody, heroically lifting the heavy burden of people needing to be experienced racing gamers in order to have fun in Rocket League.  What's the greatest about Rocket League is the feeling it gives you when you play a match. When you try it out for the first time, you actually don't feel like an insignificant player who's just filling up another slot in a team-composition game. You feel focused, and you have motivation to try your best as well as practice to get even better. It's true that at first you feel that the ball is untouchable to you and that you can't really do anything besides punt it in the air when all the other players are stuck to each other like glue, but the game makes it entirely possible for anyone to skillfully rise from that level and eventually become a flying superstar that backflips 20 feet in the air in order to score a goal. What's the best about this game is how it frustrates the player; rather than making the player yell out of pure anger, which eventually boils into hatred for the game itself, Rocket League makes players feel frustration that rather motivates them to learn from their mistakes and think about how they can do better. The feeling of failure as well as the fear of it is not a drawback of this game at all, which is what makes this game such a successful product for casual and competitive players alike. No matter what, you won't exit Rocket League feeling worse than you did before you opened it.  The only drawback in the game, however, is its matchup system. While the game itself has a quick matchmaking system that hardly ever tries the player's patience, it can be a little rough for those who are playing for the first time. Sometimes, a new player will be matched against other gamers who have accumulated skill that flies into a league completely out of the newbie's reach, which as a result turns the game into a full-fledged 2v2 with the two remaining players struggling to just keep up with the ball. The new players can learn from the pros in this sense and raise their skill cap substantially, as well as witness the endless potential Rocket League has in store when they see sick plays and jumps made by the more experienced players, but it doesn't nullify the fact that not everyone has equal grounding on the playing field. Eventually, though, the playing field does gradually beome leveled, and when the newbie who jumps for no reason turns into a champion who can barrel roll into a flying ball at a different trajectory and score a goal, the feeling of achievement in accomplishing such a feat is just amazing.  Rocket League is suited as one of the best casual multiplayer-sport-arcade games you can have on your Steam account, and I expect that it will stay that way for a long time. But, that's just my opinion. What would be yours?",

The graphic's are awesome, but this game doesn't have the best optimalisation so you need at least a medium-class PC to run it on medium settings so the game looks decent. ( lucky me i was able to play it on ultra settings ) Just to make my review easier for you to read it, I've bullet-pointed some pros + cons.  Pros: - The game is fun. - Soundtrack is amazing. - Something new, it's like fifa combined with racing games. - The game gives you the option to choose on what continent the server you want to play on will be located, so if you live in UK you can choose to only play on servers located near West. - Great game to play with your friend's. - Allow you to play with keyboard / controller.  Cons: - The game require you to have a middle-class PC in order to play. - Very few arena's meaning your most likely to play most of you matches on same arenas which is boring. - 1 Ball, no other balls every single match uses same ball which is just gray and white... - Cases, is this ♥♥♥♥ing cs:go or league of legends ? why bring cases to a goddamit football game.....  OVERALL SCORE 7/10  Great gameplay, however require some time in order to be perfect.",

Cons: - Hoops and Hockey modes aren't as developed. - Not a big fan of the DLC and 'key' mechanics, prefer everything to be available through normal gameplay.  I think the best praise I can give Rocket League is that it's a game I come back to again and again because literally every match I've ever played has been fun. Jump in and jump out for a quick game, or play several in a row for a good night with friends. Excellent game for streaming, especially with friends in voice chat. Highly recommended.",

I originally got it free on PS4 (which is what made me buy it on Steam), then I also bought it on Xbox One to play with friends on xbox. I have never owned 3 different versions of the same game in my life until now, but I don't regret it at all.  I do wish that the PC version had an exclusive car like the Xbox or PS4, but it's not like it will keep me from playing. It was also a bit worrisome when Rocket League introduced a loot crate system, but Psyonix has handled it fairly well so that a player does not gain any sort of advantage by spending money on crates/keys. All upgrades gained from the crates are purely cosmetic, and one does not have to pay extra to stay competitive.  Overall, there are a few bugs that pop up (I've never experienced anything close to game-breaking) but they normally get patched fairly quickly as Psyonix seems to listen (at least some) to their fans. The game gets regular updates, which are generally good. This is an exceptionally good game with new features being added regularly at no extra cost, which is completely worth the full price. However, it does go on sale for about $12 quite often and should be bought immdiately at that price if you are at all interested in the game.  So far, I have only encountered people who love Rocket League and people who have not played Rocket League.",

With that in mind, I'll keep my review as short, yet succinct as possible.   Rocket League is by far the most difficult game in terms of mechanics I've ever had the privilege to play. Even thought I'm close to 1000 hours in the game, it has become abundantly clear over time that I'm not meant to be a great player. I have made it as far as the third blue rank (what the hell is the name of it again?) in 2's. I have bounced back and forth between the mouse and keyboard and the controller. It's clear the controller is the superior option for playing the game, but I prefer the feel of m&amp;k.   At first, you're to be terrible. I can remember a time when I was the lowest of the low in the game. I couldn't hit anything, I didn't understand how to fly in the air, and boost was a nonexistent part of the game. However, Rocket League is one of those games where you keep playing, practicing, and learning, and eventually you'll find you've grown in rank and skill. I'm one of the few players that will invest another thousand hours into the game, but I'm afraid I've reached my peak. Even though I still enjoy the game, unlike others, a thousand hours have taught me so much but there is even more to learn.  I'll be honest, don't pick up this game expecting to be an amazing player. In fact, you'll probably spend more time in the lower elo's than in other games with a similar ranking system. But don't let it deter you. If you want to be good, you'll eventually be great.  On a side note, Psyonix is one of the few companies that truly cares about its players. They are very active on their forums and Reddit, and truly do seem like the kind of company that listens and responds to the best of their ability.   tl;dr  Game is hard. Very hard. But time, practice, patience, and a little persistence eventually leads to a skill based kind of fun.",
