    "description": "Western FPS is old-school 3D FPS, that looks and plays like the first games in this genre, that were developed in 90s. Game is based on Ray Casting technology, but it has prettier cartoon-like graphics. Western FPS includes interesting storyline, that tells you a story about Alan Wilborn.",
