            "review_text": "First the art style caught my attention, then the arena fighting kept me interested. After I got the game, I had a hard time figuring out the controls for a keyboard, and I found it rather anyoying that it doesn't tell you what buttons do what, and even more frustrating was how I haven't found a way to customize the keyboard. I've tried using a controller, but when I start the game, It disconnects whatever controller I have connected. But even though I had no Idea what I was doing, I still rather enjoy Paperbound. It's even more fun playing with friends (who also have no idea what they're doing)! It's a timeless, easygoing game that is fun for everyone!",

            "review_text": "My first encounter with Paperbound was at PAX South 2015. This game is an incredible play if you have others to play with.  It can get really crazy when you have 4 people playing against each other. They implemented AI bots as well, so even if you're without friends, you can still enjoy the game. It's difficult to find multiplayer arena games quite this enjoyable.",
