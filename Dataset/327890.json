But I do suspect Dark Souls players, such as myself, are in the right mind-set to understand I Am Bread, and enjoy it. Once I got the right idea, it became addictive and, amazingly, rather meditative.  In terms of gameplay it's slow and takes loads precission and patience. If you're expecting run-and-gun instant satisfaction, look elsewhere, this is not a CoD generation experience. Make your way through a level at a snails pace, enjoying the journey, however, and victory is incredibly rewarding. Yes, the controls take getting used to, but it honestly didn't take as long as I thought to have my bread doing air-flips.  One major issue that can't be ignored; the camera is not your friend. And in a game requiring such concentration and precission, that can be a right pain in the ♥♥♥. (Likewise with Dark Souls.)  All in all, I tip my hat to the developers for originality, incredible detail, and amazing sound design. (The music gets repetitive quick, but the sound of physical objects is outstadning.)",

            "review_text": "This is more than just a joke game. This is a masterpiece well worth your time.  CONTROLS: First of all, personally I like the control system. For the main story mode hold down a button to select a bread corner, then move it in the direction you want it to go. Sure there is a short learning curve, but I find climbing and navigating the world with these kinds of control schemes very enjoyable. The gifs you will find posted by the master players on the community hub are a joy to behold. Don't be afraid. Give it a go!  If the controls still bother you there are plenty of game modes, (including a free roam mode) starring different characters who are mostly easier to control than a bread slice.  Gameplay: The variety is what makes this game stand out against most joke simulators. There is plenty to do, and the game isn't reliant on humour to succeed.  You can enjoy a Star Wars parody, you can hunt for cheese, you can race baguettes, and you can plate up the dirtiest piece of bread you have ever seen with a smile on your face after skateboarding through dust, ants and falling in the dish water.  This is a unique fun game that deserves a chance. Give it a go.",

You might find yourself 30 minutes into a stage only to slip up and find yourself all the way back at the beginning. I'd be okay with that if the gameplay was enjoyable, but it isn't. You're a piece of bread and you move around with the agility you'd expect of a piece of bread.   In many games like this, the bad controls add to the character or humor of the game. In Surgeon Simulator, for example, the failure is largely why the game is so much fun. But this is just bread. The humor doesn't last five minutes.   I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone.",

            "review_text": "If you've ever wondered what would happen if you mashed QWOP and OctoDad together I Am Bread is it. You play a piece of bread on a quest to get toasted in each level, using various items such as irons or radiators or frying pans. Touching the floor or any other dirty surface will reduce your edibility percentage and once that hits 0% you lose.  Unfortunately, the game’s engine and programming also mean you will have to battle with the camera randomly adjusting itself on certain angles and the bread ragdolling around spastically from time to time. You can alleviate this to some degree by predicting which corner will contact next during a flip and hold that corner’s respective button down but even that can be a guessing game. Keeping in mind, your grip meter is counting down the entire time you are holding any buttons down so you’re on a time limit until you reach stable ground. After a few rounds of flailing and failure the game will throw you a bone by giving you an invincibility power up although using it basically removes any challenge from the game.  I Am Bread is one of those games where you either love the concept or hate it, and I couldn’t find anything to love about it. Maybe it’s just me, but I would rather spend time fighting bad guys than my own controller. ",

The Objective is simple. Become Toast. However. Its not that easy. In the First Level. You start off on a table, You have 3 Items along with you. Jam, Butter, And Nuts. You are able to cover your self in these. Be careful with the butter though. or you will end up on the floor dead withen 5 seconds. (Yes. This game applys to the 5 second rule. you dont get off the floor. you'll die.) But Heres the hard part. The Toaster Is All the way on the other side. It gets more creative though in later levels. such as in the bathroom you use a hair dryer (Yes i said hair dryer) To become toast. Or... You could go down the toilet and fall apart.  There are other modes then the original concept of becoming bread and not having fun. Such as... Zero G, Bagel Race, Rampage, FreeRoam, Etc.   There are also modes you can unlock from beating story mode. Such as... Starch Wars Team Fortress 2 (MEDIC!) Goat Simulator (Ram-Page)  This game i highly recommend. If you think its bad. You just are bad at controls. The game is good.  9/10",

People complain about the controls, but I have no problem flinging myself accross the room. My advice is to think a few steps ahead, and keep a cool head. The hardest part for me was figuring out the puzzles, which aren't too intensive (Definately not Portal levels of critical thought, only the last one before the epilog gave me pause.).  As for the story, it's basically summed up as bread tolling a conspiracy theorist who everyone thinks is crazy.  While the premise is simple, I actually wish Michel Bay would make a movie out of it. (Spoilers: You get to blow up a gas station! If that doesn't sell you on the game I don't know what will.) It would be such an absurd movie, but I think it would be a box-office hit!

And I had heard great things about I Am Toast. But sadly, for me at least, this game is almost unplayable. Wacky concept with pretty nice graphics and a TERRIBLE control scheme. Maybe my brain doesn't work in the way it's supposed to for this control scheme to make sense. I even played it mostly with a PS3 gamepad, and I still could not get the hang of it for the life of me. Nothing but frustration. The grip meter depletes too quickly, so you barely have time to hang onto objects. Attempting to flip over the edge of ledges is a chore in redundancy and pain, as the moment you flop onto the ground you are basically dead. You get, what, like 5 seconds at most to find a surface to latch onto after falling to the ground? I'm sorry, but this is not challenging, it's just downright AGGRAVATING.  Just when I thought the controls couldn't get any worse, I attempted Zero G mode. HA!!! A true exercise in futility. Made absolutely no sense whatsoever to me as to how to accurately control the flying toast. Honestly, the controls could have been stellar if they were based more off of the scheme used in Katamari Damacy. Maybe I'm crazy uncoordinated here, but I just can't understand how so many people out there love this game and are able to get the hang of the controls. It's rare in this day and age for me to play a game that is so unique and has so much potential, only to be buried by horrific controls. I feel like it's been a solid 5-10 years since I've played a game with a control scheme as unbareable as this one. It's sad, really, because it simply destroys what I was hoping to be a fresh, original, exciting experience like the first time I played Katamari.",

These guys have a knack for making fun, querky games that provide an interesting level of difficulty. The gameplay is inventive and you'll always be on the edge of your seat. One wrong move and there goes your level progress. This difficulty seems to add to the fun for me instead of making things frustrated. I am Bread is a bit more straight-foward compared to their last game as well since guiding your bread to a heat source to make toast is far less complicated than carefully cutting a fake person apart. One thing I will say is that if you want to play I am Bread for any length of time make sure you have a compatible controller. I downloaded the neccessary software to use my ps4 controller because my hand that controlled keyboard functions got cramped pretty fast playing. Every once in a while there is a bit of drop in framerate. I'm running a AMD 6100 6-core processor with a Radeon 6800 HD graphics card with 8GB of RAM, and I know for certain the game is having the problem. Just wait for it to catch up and then resume. I first became interested in these games after watching the guys from roosterteeth play both I am Bread and Surgeon Simulator. They should definately get thanked for their advertising of the games. I own both games. I play I am Bread here while I ussually play Sugeon simulator on PS4. Thanks guys for some fun games.",

I think I'll just get a refund. :(  I'm sure this game is very fun but be careful if you have any controller other than Xbox 360 or PS4, as those are the only officially supported ones (and even then there are several potential issues). Even if your controller works perfectly outside of I Am Bread and you've used it to play plenty of other games, there's a chance it won't work in this one.

I played SS previously and that was a pretty fun gem, yet it did have some quirks and an excessive amounts of clipping. Bread, I don't feel, is anywhere near as good as SS.   Bread's friendship with Goat Simulator sort of reduced my minimal respect for such an original game, that is Bread. GS is an extremely buggy game that thrives off of bugs, glitching and clipping, all are annoyances of mine. Labeling weak coding and QC as an aspect of gameplay doesn't cut it for me. I felt Bread went down that route a little bit, which I don't like.   Performace of Bread is questionable. I get huge frame rate drops when the Goat destruction levels start up and also every time I break that jar of jam with the bread. Speaking of the jam, the glass containers in this game look like something from a 2005 title. They are a huge eye sore, and they are everywhere. Technology exists today that makes glass look realistic... please use it. This is a 2015 title. Even with it being from a small developer, they still have enough money to get some decent looking glass going on. 21st Century Fox is a partial owner of Bossa, there's tons of money there to get some better graphics and coding. Hopefully they go down this route as Bossa becomes more popular. I hear they're working on a MMO open-world title right now... yikes. That's a huge jump.   Speaking of graphics, it's hit or miss in each level. The few levels towards the end are the worst, visually. It doesn't make sense why this is even happened other than laziness, or they ran out of time. The game has a gradual decline in graphics the further you progress. I see tons of low res textures, a very poor sky box, background visuals look like they're from the 80's, etc. Graphics aren't everything, but they are important.   Some visuals are cartoony, some are more heavily detailed.... don't mix this sh**, pick one and go with it for the whole game.  The third person camera... Christ. Yes, many games suffer from third person camera issues, especially those old GTA games, but lets get this sh** cleaned up, guys. It jumps around everywhere, clips through everything, hinders those bagel racing levels like crazy, and is poorly optimized. It pisses me off. Unity can do better.   Iffy physics. Props and movable objects sometimes do move around in a natural manner when you grab them or push them, but not all of the time. It's inconsistent, like the visuals. I've gotten stuck on props many times, and have had myself, and different objects bounce unnaturally in different directions, before saying to myself 'wtf is this sh**, seriously?'   Negatives aside, Bread does have its moments. I'm glad the 0 gravity mode is back from SS. It is very difficult to control, but is rewarding when you beat it. The humor is nice. The game is fun to watch. The concept is fresh. Like SS, the controls and movements have a steep learning curve, but is awesome when you get it down.   Like I said previously, maybe give the game a whirl, it's pretty unique. Like SS, it requires a lot of patience. As for the questionable overall quality, Bossa: talk to Fox and get some heavy funds rolling in, hire a few more devs (get some people from big triple-A companies), get some Unity pros to work with ya'll--Unity can accomplish so, so, so much more.
