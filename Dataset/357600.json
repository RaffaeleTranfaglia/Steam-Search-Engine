            "review_text": "This game was a blast. You can play it whether you have a little or a lot of time. A warning though - it is addictive so 'a little time' can easily turn into a lot if you have nowhere to be.  There's nothing bad to say really. You'll only not like Unium if you're impatient or not into puzzle games.  The difficulty ramped up well - you'll probably breeze through the Beginner and Easy levels, then start slowing down mid-way through Medium until you find yourself spending potentially hours to crack some Advanced levels (the bulk of the game is in Advanced).  Half of the achievements also give some incentive to re-do a few levels with more constraints, giving them some new life.  The music provided a nice, unobtrusive ambience that worked even for hours of play at a time.  Unium is very polished for an indie game. The UI, sound, achievements, level design, and length all feel perfectly cohesive. And it's 2 bucks!",

PROs +It's innovative and different +Simple to play +Cards and Achievements (for $1.49 @25% off - you can't go wrong)  CONS +It's too easy to look at a guide..!  SUGGESTIONs? +DEV may consider adding custom level(s) or workshop (but again for $1.49 it's not a complaint)  10/10  ",

It's nice that it has various difficulty levels but sadly there aren't many mechanics. You can't play this game in long sittings as you start seeing the optical illussion of dots at the intersections lol (issue of the game being back and white). It doesn't have that many levels nor appeal as Lyne. If you are thinking about grabbing this or some other puzzle game, I would recommend prioritizing another over this one.",

That combination makes it a perfect fit for some light casual gaming on a Windows tablet, but I enjoyed playing it on my desktop, too. For just a buck or two, you really can't go wrong if you enjoy solving puzzles.",

            "review_text": "The main aesthetics for this game are challenge and submission. It's a puzzle game (challenge) and it's repetitive enough that it's a good time waster (submission). The mechanics are simple as you just trace a path with your mouse and the line follows. The music is pretty soothing and something about the sound effects are pretty satisfying to hear, especially if you run your mouse down a line quickly.   The game has 4 levels of difficulty and each level has a lot of puzzles. It's easy to get to the advance levels pretty quickly and there are about 60 advanced puzzles, so there isn't a lack of things to do.   Pros:  + They advertise a puzzle game with a simple mechanic and that's exactly what you get.  + Difficulty tiers all have numerous puzzles so there's plenty to solve at your desired difficulty + Sound effects are fun. Music is soothing, though a little sleep inducing because it's so calm  Cons: - Eventually you'll run out of levels (though there are specific achievements for specific puzzles) - I have a short attention span so this isn't going to be a game that I'll play for a long time.   In short, if you want a simple puzzle game that has varying levels of difficulty and you like what the screenshots have, then this is a pretty nice game to have.",
