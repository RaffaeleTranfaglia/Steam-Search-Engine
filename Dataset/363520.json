To play it with a mouse is PAINFUL, just to change the way my character is looking I either have to take my hand off the mouse to use the &lt; &gt; keys, or jam my middle mouse button down, and no you cannot reassign any of the controls. There is also an issue right now with framerate regardless of the quality setting that I am playing it on. (and for reference I have 16G of ram with a video card that has 2G dedicated ram)  In the forams there is a page on how to adjust key bindings through a text file. This made the game much more enjoyable!",

            "review_text": "After about a couple of hours, I honestly hope I am not reaching the edge of current content, that right now everything storywise is in the game, because I want to play more! That being said, it is obvious that not everything is implemented just yet; the animation and textures could be brushed up, and the music needs a bit more Oomph! For example, I would really like the music to fit what the title screen has, this thumping, bass-heavy tune of impending poundage while in combat and maybe a jolly thumping while walking through a forest (again, just for examples). I like the design of the giants, as in my let's play I noted how much I loved the way the wooden giant actually looks like the Iron Giant (my favorite mech of all time), and the design overall. The differing moves between each goliath is cool, as well as the differing attributes (the nimble wood goliath vs. the bulky stone goliath). A better differing, at least between those two I mentioned, would be having the wood goliath be more visibly swift and fast in attacks while the stone goliath can pull large and heavier swings while being a bit slow. The dialogue is witty and gave me a few chuckles (especially the rats), and while it gives little to no choices, it does seem to poke fun at current rpgs. Really, the rpg function comes from constructing and customizing the goliaths, unlocking new parts and creating awesome weapons to decimate foes! Already, the dev is pumping out bug fixes, which hopefully means that bugs people are encountering will disappear quickly and this game will then begin to look better and better by the update. :) If you want to enjoy the ride and the changes this game will come with, I suggest buying it. If you wish to wait, then follow this game and/or put it on your wishlist, cuz this game is already looking good. :D",

            "review_text": "I have only been playing for 1,5 hours (if I am correct) but I really like the mechanics of the game (crafting, top down scroller, building &amp; using Mechs).   That being said: the sound could use some work. There is no story teller, so the story doesn't carry any weight and you are not dragged into it.  When you are hunting for animals or mining stuff the sound of the environment is lacking(to say the least). The music switches on and off (it actually feels like it switches of mid song, mostly during combat).  Despite this being an addictive game it would help if the game would be polished in the sound regard (for starters). Other polish points(CONS): There are some glitches&amp;cliping problems. The mechanics could use a tutorial (personally I do not mind figuring them out but I could imagine somone having issues with them). A decent questlog would be usefull.  I am having a hard time to decide weither to recommend this game: yes it is fun, it is addictive but the lack of sound is really a downer.",
