            "review_text": "i expected a bad port, but it isnt. vsync on and the game runs smoothly.  classic lara with her dual guns, handstand over an edge, landscape is bright and colourful, good puzzles, even the menu has the classic look.  a very relaxing game with soothing music and some of the puzzles can be hard to solve but once figured out, they are actually simple. starts off pretty simple for a while before you get fully submerged in its puzzles and elements.   great game that actually looks graphically pretty well and controls easily with the mouse only. plenty of collectibles (in ancient vases) to unlock stuff. just like they used to be before we had to pay for everything.
