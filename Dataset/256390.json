            "review_text": "MotoGP 13 was okay (even rather good in places) but ultimately flawed. However, the improvements required were obvious and should have been easy for Milestone to fix. Well, they didn't - in fact, they've made it worse. Much, much worse.  There are virtually no graphics quality settings whatsoever and no AA control at all. In-game graphics are a bizarre mixture of out-of-focus fuzziness for when in the pit, to glossy realism on the podium, to a jagged mess (due to no AA) on the track. Bike control hasn't improved, still no proper XB360 controller for PC, exiting the game currently requires CTRL+ALT+DEL and Task Manager, tyre grip still isn't modelled, bike setup is still childishly pointless because it does so little. And now it's riddled with DLC.  I'm a big fan of MotoGP but how on Earth Dorna Sports can let such a potentially fantastic license be ruined by such inept software development is beyond me. Milestone claim to have fully revamped the game engine but the evidence for this is painfully absent.  Don't waste your money on this game.",

Before I did buy this game I was going thrugh the reviews, so I wasn´t expecting a lot. To make this short, this game has outdated graphics, PS3 at the best, it is a bugfest extravaganza, I can´t exit the menu without ctrl+alt+del, there is no exit button, the game has many glitches, no graphics settings, sounds aren´t so great. From what I read Milestone does not give a xxxx about all of they games. If you want to know just try the demo first. I have also tried the RIDE game demo, not good, the bad is that all of these games have great potential and Milstone just don´t care. I wish someone else can step in and make a great moto GP game that looks good, sounds good, plays good and does have an exit button.",

I cannot get the game to close without pulling up the task manager and using it to end task. I really hope they fix it soon!",

The gameplay is fine, possibly even better than 2013's game, but that gets overlooked when you realize that the career mode only has half the riders it's meant to (and the others are 'day one' DLC that hasn't been released now some week and a half after the game was released.   It's quite disappointing for anyone who wanted to play career and is a fan of MotoGP or Moto2/3 that the riders they're looking forward to racing aren't actually taking part in the races.   There's a few new game modes, some of which are interesting, but for me at least, the lack of functioning career mode with all the riders (And the few bugs i've encountered - you can't exit the game if you play career mode, you have to alt+f4, etc) mean that I can't really recommend it. Wait and see, and perhaps it'll get better, if we ever get the support we want from the devs, that is.",

Graphics are worse, glitchs all over the place(and I have a good gaming set up) and where in the hell did they record the bike sounds(sounds are like a cat fight at the bottom of a trash can). They had better come up with something stunning this year or say goodbye to one of the all time great run of racing sims. For god's sake don't buy, read the reviews (shame I didn't) Badman Bob",

            "review_text": "Ok, having played this game abit more with AFX turned off it is alot better and much improved compared to 13.  The riding is the best when set to full simulation and this is where it belongs and is most rewarding.  Some things lacking are the audio, GP bikes sound crazy but these are very flat. Track detail are very bland some circuit backdrops are beutiful in real life but in the game you rarely take notice of anything beyond the bland grass. Those who to to a track such as Philip Island will imediately notice the beatiful sea from the back straight or the lush mountains surounding Mugello. Makes world class tracks feel uninspiring.  Afew very basic bugs that shouldn't be there are  No way of exiting the game when you exit campaing mode. Yes that's right check the HUB it's the number 1 issue. You need to bring up the windows task manager and kill the proces..... ConTROLLs don't save properly sometimes it decides to choose to use saved controls and other times it doesn't. Research selection in Campaing mode gets reset if you restart the race, so sometime you may not get the research points you should have if you're research selection is on something that has just maxed out...  Can do better force feed back for controllers, some parts are very good but others not so. I still feel MotoGP 08 is better in this aspect and regarding the sound as well. Graphics are better here but track environment is much better in 08. Yes I am still comparing a 2014 game to a 2008 game....  The need for a perfect MotoGP game asside this is better than MotoGP 13 so I guess they're improving.   If there is anything they should keep from this game for the future is the ride mechanics/simulation. It's properly good. Everything else working please.",

AI glitch too much so for people playing career mode you might have some issues and for online racings just dont use them hands down. NO AI online.  2.Chat status button is still fixed to right joystick click. why...modded my controller and removed the pins for the L3 button. SAme thing i did to my ps3 controller.  other then that its reallly fun!!! I played quite a few online races today. Each race was competitive AND NO LAG YAY!!! [took six months though]   Go buy it!! its fun   THIS GAME WAS RELEASED UNFINISHED. SERIOUSLY PS3 VERSION SUCKS AND THE PC? EVEN WORSE! IT JUST GLITCHES TWITCHS AND FREAKS OUT A LOT FASTER THEN THE CONSOLE VERSIONS. SERIOUSLY IVE HAD IT WITH THIS GAME. IT DOESNT MATTTER WHO YOU ARE YOU CANT DENY THIS GAME WAS NOT FINISHED AND IS NOT PLAYABLE ONLINE...PERIOD i WANT MY MONEY BACK..  amd FX3820 EIGHT CORE 3.5 8GBDDR3 R9 2702GB  HERES MY LIST OF EVERY SINGLE THING THAT IS WRONG WITH THIS GAME...  1.NO RIDER CUSTOMIZING. NOTHING 2.NO REAL TRAINING COURSE 3.TO MANY LOADING SCREENS/MAINLY A PS3 ISSUE LOADING TIMES ARE FAST FOR PC 4.NO HOST MIGIRATION OR ABILITY TO CHANGE LOBBY SETTINGS. HOST HAS TO LEAVE TO CHANGE SETTING AND LOBBY WILL DROP.  5.PC LOBBIES ALWAYS START YOU IN STANDARD PHYSICS.....  6.PC/PS3  CANT CHANGE CHAT STATUS BUTTON. THIS IS BY FAR THE BIGGEST PLAW IN MOTOGP FOR THE PS3 AND SOMEHOW XBOX 360 CONTROLLERS ON THE PC. PS3 CONTROLLERS ACT FUNNY, BUT WORK SOMETIMES THEN NOT. I WANT TO MEET THE GUY WHO SAID THAT WAS A GREAT IDEA. LOCK THE CHAT STATUS BUTTON ON THE PS3 AND SOMEHOW I CANT CHANGE IT WITH THE 360 CONTROLLER ON THE PC?  7.AI SLOW EXCEPT IN CAREER MODE UNTIL LATELY.... 8.GAME DROPS PLAYERS FROM LOBBY. EITHER YOU, SOMEONE ELSE OR THE WHOLE LOBBY. SO FAR PC ITS HAPPEN A FEW TIMES AND THE PS3 50% I SAY 50% OF GAMES WE START DROP PLAYER/PLAYERS FROM LOBBY. OVER HALF THE GAMES DROP MAKING THIS GAME UNPLAYABLE ON THE PS3 AND NOW THE PC... 9.PEOPLE LAG, GLITCH, JUMP, FLY YOU NAME IT, ITS PATHETIC ON EVERY CONSOLE AND PC. ITS JUST HORRRIBLE. IT JUST GLITCHES A LOT FASTER ON THE PC. LIKE ITS ABLE TO PROCESS THE CODE THATS BROKEN FASTER THUS DISPLAYING THE HORRIBLE ENGINE PHYSICS FASTER. FOLLOW ME? CANT PLAY ONLINE SO SAD 10.NOTHING TO DO OFFLINE LIKE TAKE A TRAINING COURSE OR TO SOME CHALLAENGES. THE MAKE YOU DO THIS 'REAL TIME EVENT' THATS JUST YOU RACING CRAPPY AI FOR LIKE 5 LAPS LOL. BUT I WILL SAY GRAND PRIX MODE HAS A 30 LAP SETTING AND YOU CAN SAVE IN BETWEEN WEEKENDS JUST INCASE YOU GOTTA GO. 11.AUDIO CRAP. THATS A NICE BAND NAME  12. DID I MENTION YOU CANT PLAY THIS GAME ONLINE WHICH IS WHY A LOT OF PEOPLE BUY IT. IT DESERVES A SECOND MENTION 13.SPEAKING OF 13, THAT WAS A GREAT GAME. BUT I BOUGHT IT 6 MONTHS AFTER IT WAS RELEASED MAYBE AN UPDATE CAME THREW FOR IT. 14. EMAILS PROMISING AN UPDATE AND FACEBOOK POST OF AN UPDATE THAT DIDNT FIX ANY ONLINE ISSUES....  I WANT MY MONEY BACK. I LOVE MOTOGP GAMES BUT IM SORRY DONT BUY THIS. UNLESS YOURE A DIE HARD MOTOGP AND WANT TO THREW MONEY INTO SOMEONES POCKET FOR A UNFINISHED GAME GO AHEAD.  NOV 4TH THE SO CALLED USA RELEASE DATE IS THE ONLY HOPE LEFT FOR THIS GAME....I DONT SEE A BRIGHT FUTURE MILESTONE IS ALREADY PRODUCING A NEW IP RIDE....I DONT CARE ABOUT MY GRAMMER IM SO DONE WITH THIS GAME. MONEY BACK PLEASE.....",
