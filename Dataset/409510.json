What I understand as the premise of the game is that you're trying to make your house look cool by gathering materials from the biomes.   Aesthetics  - You have decent ambience for the loading screen, and that's the ONLY part of the game you will hear music in. - It felt like the Developers couldn't figure out whether to make the sounds realistic or fictional, but they're pretty bad nontheless. - The HUD(Heads-Up Display) is awful, making the chat box look basic, and the menus look like they're put onto parchment paper, which is a 'no' in my book. - THE PLAYERS.....I still haven't slept. But to be honest here, they look like bobbleheads, only 5 times creepier. - World Design is not that well, and I am considering the scars left by other players.   Pros  - Minecraft for the poor? (Then again, there's Trove)   Cons  - Microtransactions in a building game? Really? - The Biomes NEVER reset (as far as I could tell), so you'll be scrounging for wood. - Your house won't have much space unless you spend real money on the game (Thanks, Microtransactions!).   Conclusion  Unless you feel like playing an obvious clone of Minecraft, don't play this game.",

Genesis Online... But I Have to thank my friends mostly. they played the game with me for ten minutes trying to embark on this soul searching journey of epic proportions, but alas, they did not have a strong will like I. I searched every corner... of every map... i met three fine fellows (more than i thought would be playing this game), one with sanity, the other two... those poor souls... convinced that this game was good... editing their home worlds... following someone asking them to go mining... god bless them... but the sane one, Hitler, was an experienced pioneer in the darkest areas ofm steam... The Free To Play Games... he was able to keep his sanity after playing quite a bit of these games... i envy him you know?... the ability to go on... without a care... without a purpose... just for fun... i wish i was as smart as he... i contemplated suicide... multiple times in a minute... but there was no noose... nobody came to end my suffering... in the end i gave up... hoping to start the quest again the next day... and this time with success.  ,End Log",

Well, I don't know, I haven't heard from him in 200 years, his Steam status still says 'MarkusMan is playing Genesis Online' I'm pretty sure he might still be waiting on the loading screen, his play time is 175200 hours, and it's still going up to this day. Now I'm sure you're all thinking 'How am I not dead after 200 years' well, kiddies, I've done of few sins (one of them is playing this game) and since I know know from Genesis Online what hell looks like, and if I die I'll have to go to hell, and I don't want to live in Genesis Online for the rest of time.  Update: I went to my friend Markus's place and I found him as a skeleton, and I was right, Genesis Online was still on the loading screen, they did an autopsy on him, and they found out that he died from aids, which is weird since tests showed he was still a virgin, I think I know why. It's cause Genesis Online f*cked him, illumati confermed.  my rating 69/21 would lose a close friend again  P.S. I think I may have aids too, but I still have will to live because I still don't want to live in Genesis Online for the rest of time. ",
