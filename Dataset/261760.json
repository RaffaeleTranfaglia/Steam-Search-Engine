            "review_text": "On my second playthrough of this game and I have to say it is unexpectedly beter than I thought it would be.  If I had to try to classify it, I would say it is a mix of the old school magic FPS games like Hexen and Herectic with some Diablo loot collecting and some crafting thrown in for good measure.  Requires a decent rig, but it is great fun once you understand the mechanics of the game.  With 8 spell schools to choose from(each with 3 spell types) and three spell attunements to apply to each of those spells, there is a huge variety in what you can do.  The game is also more tactical and less twitch than I initially thought it would be which is also a good thing IMO.   In short, give it a try. Freeze, burn, shock, phase, corrupt, force and necro to your heart's content! Oh and craft new spells too...",

            "review_text": "Lichdom: Batlemage brings a great concept on the table... But fails to deliver on many aspects. When I saw quotes like 'Never has magic felt as powerful', I expected a lot from this game... But here are my pros and cons:  Pros: - Amazing graphics. Excellent use of the CryEngine engine, locations feel real, many details, beautiful overall. - Magic feels very good, visually. - The whole 'magic' part is based on a very good (and new) concept that has an amazing potential. - They tried really hard to make you care about the lore, the characters, the past events, but...  Cons: - Linear levels with some 'goodies' on the side. - Repetitive x1000. - I honestly couldn't care less about certain characters or events. While I understood the story, I didn't feel 'in it' at all.   The whole 'previous war/moonbreaker thing is nice, but, for example, when Gryphon died, I've felt just nothing ! Couldn't care less... I MEAN I'VE BEEN TRACKING HIM AND HEDIRA FOR HOURS IN THIS STUPID SWAMP !   - The inventory and the crafting system.  The problem is that, after a while in the game, you just keep doing this:  &gt;be at checkpoint &gt;go forward onto the path that you cannot divert of &gt;ennemies spawn of the ground around you &gt;usually some running weak minions, some stronger various flying/walking/beasts/archers and eventually a lieutenant or mini boos &gt;combo, kill, dodge your way out of the fight &gt;go forward 50 meters &gt;repeat  Sometimes you'll find yourself at key points in the story and you'll have to fight a boss... And that's kinda all. If the levels were to be shorter and the magic really more  powerful , the whole 'repeat' thing wouldn't be such a problem. But here, since even the slightest minion levels up as the game advances, it still takes the same freaking time to eradicate them, especially when you consider that at the start of the game you would have dealt 50 damage with a particular combo, and at the end 16'000 !  So yeah, given the fantastic possibilities of this magic system, I would have loved a game that actually make me feel like a badass - mid-game and onward, you should have been able to oneshot whole enemies waves with well executed combos, instead of that, you're just doing the same thing over and over again.  Sooo... Recommended, yeah, because I still had some fun playing it.. But only if you are into this type of games and only if it is on sale.  1) Stay away  2) Only recommended when on sale  3) Recommended 4) Highly recommended 5) This is a must play",

It reminded me of Painkiller series, but focused on exploring and experimenting how your weapon works rather then just shoot everything with anything.  Also, game's difficulty mostly defined by your spellkit. You can faceroll or suffer, so it's your choice and challenge after all.  I've read a couple of 'No' reviews and didn't get why these people were so dissapointed, it's a quite solid and complete game. Though I agree it just don't worth more than 50% of it's tag price.",

            "review_text": "First of all cons of the game:  Each level is a long LOOONG LOOOOOONG glorified corridor with lots and lots and lots and lots of repetitive mobs ;   Also, I would've liked (personally) to see some melee combat, I mean, if you're the badass mage you're suppose to be, why not go full-badass and become the true 'DRAGON' aka go all Rand Al'Thor on your enemies, with full-on bladedancing while shooting fire from your hands.  The game allows you to create hundreds of spells to use, but only 3 schools of magic can be 'attuned' at a time, so if you leveled, say lightning up to lvl 8, and then decided to switch to ice, but ice is not one of your 'attuned' schools, you have to drop lightning completely (it will reset its attunement level to 1) to start lvling up your ice magic.  Checkpoints are unevenly spaced, and maybe a full standard for PC games 'save' system would've been better.   Now that we're past my 'cons' section, the rest is the pros:  Great visuals, Good voice acting,  Lots and lots and lots of different combinations of explosive magic to use,  Some trully teethgridning moments (and by that I mean the action becomes quite intense, with some moments being close to 'Serius Sam' level of intensity)  Great vistas Brutally awesome sound (you got to hear the lightning spells, those are just epic to listen to)  Story is rather mediocre.  Length-wise it took me 23h to finish my firth run-through.   Overall I would say that for a first game the studio did a great job. And they have some great potential here to create a masterpiece in a form of a sequel. What I would like to see is more of an open world for exploration, CQC action with swords and shield, aside from just using your magic abilities, better narrative, more variety of foes to tackle.   Do I reccomend it? If you like crafting your magic, like some challange, yeah, sure, you'll deffinitly won't find a mage like this one in any other modern game. ",

            "review_text": "Okay, so this game kinda lost me at first. I wanted to make powerful spells but lost interest due to the complicated crafting and not-so-great turtorials. HOWEVER, with the latest patch and the 'Smart Crafting' system, the game got me again. I think I'm still early on in the game, but i will finish it when I have time.  The 'Smart Craft' is essentially like this. Say you have one spell with A Lob effect, a Trap effect, and your usual Nova. The smart crafting will take what would work best with your current set up and give you the option to upgrade it. It'll even let you know and quickly synthesize your weaker upgrade items into more powerful ones. So basically, pick what effects you want for your spells, then the game will help you pick what's best for it. It's for those who don't wanna use a lot of time on the crafting system.  This is especially good for the game since a lot of the bad reviews are because of the crafting system.",

            "review_text": "Hmmm, not bad. Not ground-breakingly good either. But it's not bad.  The best way to imagine this game is to take a typical FPS, but instead of armor and weapons, you use perfectly timed shields or short 0.5meter teleports to evade, and spells for weapons. As for the weapons, you get the basic item called a Sigil, and you craft a spell from it adding all kinds of characteristics to it and such. Suppose your spell is Fire, Ice, Lightning, Necromancy. Then you decide whether it is a projectile (homing or artillery), contnuous ray, or area of effect, etc.  That, and it is linear. Sooooo linear.   Get it at a discount. Worth it at a discount.   UPDATE: I am finding myself using the Lob characteristic for my spells. The Ray and Missile characteristic is weak and seems pointless. The thing is, the Lob characteristic is the same for all spells. You 'lob' the 'magic' at your enemies (fire, ice, lightning, necromancy, etc), and when it hits, it explodes into tinier lob balls.  The Ray is the same for all spells. And the Missile is the same for all spells as well. There really isn't any real variety to the magics.  UPDATE (Dec12,2014): After 30 hours of gameplay, this game DOES make you feel like a bad ♥♥♥ Battlemage. Like, 'You wanna piece of me? Well I want a million pieces of you, ya little prick!' 'Oh, what's that? You a big scary demon? I'll send you to the Abyss!' 'I'LL BURN AND FREEZE YOU BOTH AT THE SAME TIME!!!' 'Let's see you get resurrected after the Nothingness eats you, you incestous narcissist!'  Yeah!   I just wish Quick Blinking was quicker and covered more distance as you upgrade your shields. That, and Charged Blinking was also quicker.",

            "review_text": "Oh boy I gathered my toughts about this game for quite a long time. I simply couldn't decide is it worth recomending...  Sigils: A good variety of sigils but still most of them works the same way (in destruction) as debuffs well we have a good variety but still AOE spells ICE/Kinesis/Phase anchor the enemies more or like the same... I hardly can put Kinesis as a spell so I find it a bit hard to place in Battlemage role... It would be better to have Air based sigil instead of kinesis but thats just my opinion.  Necromancy... I got a love hate relationship with this one... (spoiler) we fight undeads by creating more undeads well fight poison with poison but still somehow wrong... Summoning system is well executed you need to mark enemy and after You kill it you will get an undead. Rest of the sigils did its work for me. Specialls were good just trigering them takes more work than effect... Overall - YES it was good - still could be better  Spell crafting: Its a nice thing to have smart inventory and custom you cook your spells as you want. All options with crafting are good. I wanted more AOE effects and more targeted effects. Elemental summons would be nice to have not only as synergy type... thing is with one type of sigil and one type of spell you can actually beat the game so it is a bit linear... System itself is ok but it needs expansion. My expectations were much bigger... overall- NO needs expansion...  Shields: 3 types and they work ok. Idea with shields is a good one - YES for me  Plot: (spoiler) As we play plot seems to be ok. We wanted mostly to kick ♥♥♥ with magic so who needs a plot? :D  We have a vengance thirst for power, undeads, we meet a friend the friend gets killed and we need more vengance... In the end I think creators dimply run out of ideas how to end plot line... its really linear and borring and incomplete...  Plot overall - NO it sucked...  Graphics and animation - looks good all flows in nice colors and animation - YES it is good  Boss fights: Some minor bosses were worse than the main ones... I had my time YES it was fun  Secrets and specials: not so secret and not so special anyone with a sharp eye can get it all... NO  Fight in general: As I was closing to endgame I was begging for it to end... After some time it gets boring - It needed a bit more of variety.. But bashing the sh*t out of my foes still was fun - so lets say YES :D  I recomend this game but ONLY on some good sales its not worth its basic price... If you buy it just to mash the undeads and other minions demons etc it will do its work.  ",

Don't get me wrong, I have loved every second of this game so far, from the slaughtering of helpless undead to defeating powerful bosses and learning the rich crafting system. However, the game does indeed have some flaws. The combats is, although fast paced and good looking, kinda repetitive. You don't get bored, but it's not varying battles or something like more open world games. Here you got 3 spells and then 2-3 variations of them, depending on your spell-setup. Also,the variety of enemies isn't that great. You usually (as far as I've come in the game) just face off against some skeletons, zombies or the cultists that control them. The only exception is bosses and mini-bosses. But enough about the bad, focus on what's great! The graphics and setting of the world is stunningly beautiful, with varied environments and views. It's actually fun to craft once you start getting the hang of the system in use, and there are great posibilities here. Sure, I don't know it all yet, but I'm getting there! And of course it's always a pleasure to burn your enemies to death in a great blast, only to raise them as your loyal servants the next moment!  All in all I highly reccomend it for most people. It is story-driven and kinda narrowed down, so if an open world is your highest wish, this might not be for you though.  This is how mages should be, always badass!",

So after 7 hours in the fun mainly comes from trying out new spells or to get apocalyptic- or synergies-effects. The rules by which these effects appear aren't written down clearly anywhere. Aside from that it's really just 'get some numbers higher'.You can also only have 3 active 'elements' (sigils) at once. No clue why they limited that.

Not 'Cthulu' and 'We're-going-to-show-graphic-depictions-in-slow-motion-close-ups-of-people-getting-dismembered-limb-by-limb-and-then-eviscerated' graphic and disturbing, but   very   disturbing all the same. The content alone should earn this game an M-rating, and I don't say that out of personal offense. I enjoy the game, but you HAVE been warned. The language in this game, while not constantly M-rated, is definitely deserving of an M-rating, simply because of how often the characters swear. It's completely understandable, given their circumstances, and realistic to be sure, but it's not kid-friendly language, so don't get it for your pre-teen thinking they won't hear a few new words and look them up. Because they will. Seriously, anyone who considers this game: it's more disturbing than the original  Prototype . (Not nearly as much visceral gore though.)  *END OF CONTENT DISCLAIMER*   Also, I use terms from the game, instead of trying to describe them as something else. Watch a Youtube video of it, and you'll understand why.  Still reading? Excellent. Let's get to the good stuff.  Okay, first off, it lives up to the premise of 'throw out the stereotype of the squishy magic user'. You're pi$$ed-off, you're powerful, and you wreak havoc. Almost constantly. (Hey, even the hero needs a few minutes to catch his breath, right?)  Additionally, the variety of spells available to be created is truly enormous; the game lives up to its big promise here. I've only managed to craft a handful of Uniques so far, and they're the endgame content.  ABOUT SYNERGIES: Not all Uniques you can craft will have a Synergy, and not all Synergies will be usable***, even if you have the right sigils. Be aware, it's also possible you might craft a Unique and get a Synergy, only to have it not be for a Sigil you've been leveling - which, from what I've been able to discern, really sucks.*****  ***Continued in the 'MINOR CONS' section below. *****Continued in the 'MAJOR CONS' section below.  Now I'll break it down into distinct pros and cons (of what I've encountered so far - I'm still playing through).   PROS :   The game surprised me with how long each section is - pleasantly so. If you like this style of game, then it's worth it, considering the amount of content.   The tutorial system included in the game was well-written, and well-explained.   For the true explorer-types, there are little hidden areas that can only be found with a careful eye and a bit of experimentation, and they're pretty rewarding finds, so keep your eyes open.   Old spells can be recycled, in a way, though the amount of each spell which can be recycled lessens as the game progresses.   There is a fully-functioning, lore-based save system, and while you lose environmental progress, YOUR progress remains.   The villains in this game? Oh, you have no idea. They are evil. As in 'If they were fighting Hitler, you'd be rooting for Hitler*' evil. I'm not kidding. Extremely good job on making us hate the villains.   *(I didn't say  ally with  Hitler. You'd just beat him after the even worse guys are dead.)   CONS :    MAJOR CONS :   *****   I don't know if it's possible to re-level a Sigil you stopped leveling. The game informs you 'this sigil will lose all leveling progess if it loses focus', and it does lose the progress - possibly permanently: it isn't clear if it's possible to re-earn the previous points/bonuses.   AT FIRST GLANCE, ALTHOUGH THIS IS WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE CASE, I AM NOT  CERTAIN  IF I AM CORRECT. If it  is   impossible  to regain lost Sigil levels and upgrades (instead of forcing you to re-earn them), that's a very poor mechanic.   If ANYONE is able to verify whether or not this is true, please, let me know - I'd rather have an accurate review, especially as this is a major part of the game. (Also, I really hope it isn't true!)     MINOR CONS :   ***   While it is possible to have up to 9 Unique spells equipped, you can only have a maximum of (I surmise) 3 Synergies ACTIVE at any one time (one for each spell bank). (Meaning that, when you trigger a Synergy from the equipped Spell Bank, THAT Synergy is the one that is used.)   This is based on my character having two Synergy-Spells equipped on the same Spell Bank (Kinesis, in this case), and being able to use only 1 at a time, despite having both of the other required elements in other Spell Banks (Fire and Lightning).   There is no way to cancel a Synergy that you're charging/have fully charged, without actually using it. You will start to hate muscle-memory when you forget this.   Some of the more difficult battles (boss battles) can be VERY challenging if you don't have the right sigil combination, and/or you can't figure out what makes the boss 'tick', because NOTHING is explained in those battles; you need to play it by ear, and you need good reflexes.   There is no 'try before you buy' (so to speak) selection process for sigils; you don't even get a description of the spells for each sigil until you've already selected it. (You do, however, get a brief overview of each sigil when at the reliquary).     VERY MINOR CONS    You can't sprint when you're charging a spell (although you  can  Blink) -  any  spell. This can get annoying, but I will concede that if they removed that limiter, the game would become significantly less challenging in certain parts.   PRO/CON (personal choice):   Somewhat repetitive gameplay, so don't expect to play through it all at once unless you REALLY like this style of play. (And have a LOT of free time on your hands - though I admit that I'm playing this like I play Skyrim: leave NOTHING unexplored.)   The entirety of the game is in 1st-person view. I personally prefer that, but I know some people who HATE 1st-person.   There is no save-scumming, at least so far as I've been able to tell.   *FAIR WARNING* THE ONLY WAY TO PAUSE ALL ACTION IS TO USE THE 'ESC' KEY. NOTHING ELSE WILL PAUSE. REMEMBER THIS WHILE CRAFTING.  And the only gameplay tip I'll give: ALWAYS observe the habits of enemies. You can play to the enemies' weaknesses if you know them well enough.  FINAL VERDICT: All-in-all, the game seems to be a cross of twich-based, high-adrenaline spellfests, and tense hyper-alertness in atmospherically-fitting environments. Or moments of revulsion at the actions of the villains. STAY AWARE of your surroundings, and how best to use them to your advantage.

If you want a linnear, well made, magic based FPS then this is your game.  The game IS very linnear, but it is also VERY fun. There are a lot of ways to mix and match spells. You can get really deep into the spellcrafting and micro manage your items to maximize the effect, or you can auto craft and just play. First few hours I auto crafted until I got the hang of the spells. Now I can craft EPIC spells.  There are only a few types of enemies, and you will often feel overpowered, but then a strong enemy will come along and put you in your place. The boss fights are tough, sometimes really hard in fact, but all managable. The graphics are pretty sweet too! I couldnt play (well) on my laptop, even though I easily met minimum requirements, playing on lowest settings. Still only got like 20fps a lot of the time, it was pretty rough.  But the game IS really fun IMO, but do a bit of research, because it is a very linear straight forward game. But it is fun as hell to ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ up with awesome magic.  78/100- definitely worth it during a sale under $15",

Pros: - Cryengine 3 graphics are excellent. - Enjoyable game play with well designed levels. - Story is okay, immesive and logical. - a needed break from MMORPG and a nice upgrade from modded skyrim.  Cons: - The spell crafting system is way more cumbersome and confusing than it needs to be with an overwhelming number of statistics that in the end don't really ammount to anything significant. - Although there are thousands of spell combinations you don't end up using them because the gameplay is one dimensional. Each level more or less goes blast through tons of trash mobs and then fight boss battle. I went through the game with pretty much just one spell once i found what was most effective. - spells need re-balancing, little point in using anything else than max dps Single target missile attacks. - although alot of detail went into the environments they are just decoration and cannot be interacted with.  Again i think this game is worthwhile for mmorpg and/or Elder scrolls lovers but it is more or less a on trick pony shoot em up.",

While the game sounds cool, the premis of being an all powerful battlemage the game diddn't give me that feeling.  The spells are cool and you can esentially non stop cast but the spells you can use during each encounter are limited to three elements and only a few attack spells per. You have to stop and change you're slots and when you do you lose the level progress. I was hoping for a complete toolbelt of spells. I'm the kind of guy that likes keybinding too so it would've been cool to be able to sue some of that.  FIghts are redundant. You can draw on a endless supply of power but you will soon find that you cast the same one or two spells over and over and over and again and again...  If you're reading this let me ask you a question. Did you play Skyrim? If yes then I will tell you the spellcasting system is similar to the one spell in one hand, one in another. Though Skyrims spell system is not anywhere as indepth as Lichdom I will say Skyrim is still better because even though the spell system is limited the gameplay doesn't feel so redudtant and linear.

Also the story was talked about in other reviews so i will skip this part. For the gameplay I can say it is quite fun to play. You have dozens of different kinds of spells to play around with and you can craft you own set of spells for your vengeful crusade. The crafting system is rather simple altough you sometimes have to scroll through loads of spell materials. Let's look at the details of this crafting system. You have 8 different sigils. The sigils are influencing how your spell will behave the most. You have classics as e.g. Fire, Ice or Lightning sigils but also something like Kinetic or Necromancy. After choosing one of these sigils you have to choose the type of spell you want to create. There you can either take a targeted spell, an aoe or a nova spell (wich can be activated by using your shield at the right moment to kind of 'counter' enemy attacks with a special effect). While targeted spells can either be lobbed, missiles or rays, aoes can be traps, direct aoe or pools. As far as i know the nova spells have no further variation. So like this for each of the 8 sigils we have 3 variations for targeted and aoe spells and 1 for nova what adds up to 7 variations. Each of the varations including nova can be further modified by an attunement, meaning either destructive, control or mastery. While destructive spells do direct dmg control spells do less dmg but stun, slow, knockback or do other cc stuff. Mastery spells sometimes do cc the enemy but the most important about that attunement is they store dmg on the enemy that can be discharged by critically hitting with a destuctive spell (what basically means charging a targeted or aoe spell because then the always critically hit). So every one of those 7 variations can be changed by 3 attunements. So every sigil has 21 possible kinds of spelltypes. Also there are many kinds of stats that can change the spell like improved charging speed or higher critical dmg. What do I want to say with that? If you are a fan of fine tuning and like numbers and percentages and the possibility to craft your own set of combinations that synergizes well, then this game might be fun for you. Also if you enjoy some kind of repetition (or grinding mechanics) you might like this game. If you hate repetition whatsoever and don't like to tune your stuff to the max this game might be not fun for you. Although there was a simple version of the crafting system implemented with the smart inventory that does everything for you, in the end it only upgrades spells you already have and does not give you other variations. But when it comes to upgrading your spell materials (from common to uncommon to rare to epic to legendary) it is a very helpful feature and saves a lot of time.  If you like the mentioned mechanics you should definitely give Lichdom: Battlemage a try. If you are not sure but like the idea just wait for a sale and then slay some undead!",

I rate this game positively, but I didn't really feel like finishing it after getting about halfway through.   Is it fun? Well, that can be debated. While the spellcasting and spellmaking is neat, it isn't exactly fun to actually play. Don't get me wrong, a lot of work went into this game. The graphics are quite polished, and the environments are pretty interesting, if a little stifling in their hallway-esque design.   The spellmaking, more or less the main feature of this game is fairly robust. You take a basic sigil (fire, lightning, ice, necromancy, etc) add a shape (is it a grenade, a ray, some kind of trap?) and finish it off with various modifiers that determine damage or debuffs or whatever. The game's tutorial sucks at explaining itself, so I had to go look at how to do it on YouTube. That said, it is pretty fun --- if you're into shooters.  That's the thing, this game straddles a pretty weird line between being a shooter and an action RPG. Yeah, there are numbers flying over enemy heads and stuff, but it feels like you're just battling the same dudes over and over again while either seeking cover, putting up your shield, or dodging. I'm not the biggest fan of shooters, but I do love RPGs, while the RPG elements were enough to get me to play the game, I didn't stick around enough to actually finish it. The level design just seems to ask us to go from point A to point B and shoot up a bunch of stuff. That's great, or whatever, but it didn't really pull me into the game and make me feel like a badass wizard, which, is what I feel that the game is aiming for.   Part of this is the story. I do not care at ALL about it. Like, it has the cheesiest, silliest baselessly evil villain with no redemptive features that pretty much defines the story. I couldn't care less, and I like a little cheese to go with my vidya.

The following are the reasons why I do NOT recommend this game to anyone.   1: I have been a RPG fan for the majority of my life, and I can tell you: This is not a RPG. Consider Serious Sam, only instead of bullets you shoot magic.   There is no strong story line, no character development, no sensible balance between physical-magical abilities and no items. Just mindless hack and slash from area to area without any rhyme or reason.   Most notably, there is no discoveries or adventure, which is perhaps the most notable aspect of any good RPG.  2: The premise of magic is abhorrently wrong. One can clearly sense that the developers had some system of magic like Skyrim in mind, and thought: 'Hey, wouldn't it be cool if the hero had no limitations like mana etc?'.  The result is just bizarre. You can only have 1 spell equipped at any time, there is no artistic way of combining them together: Simply hack and slash, just with magic.   Even Dragon Age 2 got it better than this, of course far far better. Not to mention games like Path of Exile which have a clearly different and much better progress.  3: The diffidently spikes are extremely annoying. You have 3 shields, if you lose them, you die and have to start from the checkpoint. Easy? Nope:  - 'I just wanna be a tanky mage with lots of AOE!'  - 'No can do sonny, now dodge, dodge, DODGE! RUN! Oh you got hit twice? You dead sonny, start from the beginning.'  //  To recap, the whole premise is a lie: This is neither a Role Playing Game nor is based on Magic (at least so far that other success RPGs have put forward). If you are a fan of hack and slash games you may like this, but others please stay away and do not waste 40$ on this one.",

I tried to get as far as I could with it, but frustration and repetition set in. The combat was nice at first, but it quickly became a chore to play.  Few spells gave decent damage for later levels and boss fights, and the game did not reward experimentation with spells. If anything, it promotes sticking with the basic elements, fire, ice, and lightning. All other spells become obsolete once you start making synergy spells because you can't combine any other triad of elements, and at badass difficulty, you're punished for swapping elements by having unequipped elements reset to level 1. Whatever was the developer thinking when placing such limitations on spells when the entire game revolves around spell-making?  After a while, the novelty of the combat wears off, and you realize that spells don't really evolve over time. You just shoot the same fireballs, the same lightning, the same ice shards from beginning to end with very little variance in either appearance or stats. The lack of progress eventually made me too tired of the game to even finish the story mode. I didn't even make it to the portals and Newb Game Plus. I simply couldn't take the repetition and seemingly endless supply of enemies to kill. I wanted more depth and more story; I wanted less running from point A to point B.",

That's what Lichdom purports to be. I was imagining unlimited Bioshock plasmids or Skyrim dual wielding with no cooldowns, but the end result is a much spottier affair.  The combat is the sole focus of the game - there is no exploration and a vapid narrative - and it is extremely daunting to the unitiated. There are multiple base damage types (fire, ice, lightning, etc), a handful of manifestations for the damage (AoE, missile, ray) and modifers upon modifiers, all represented with changing values and percentages. This in actuality is the real game - combining spell components and modifiers to produce more powerful versions of your spells, to counter the increasingly powerful enemies. The use of the crafting system is virtually unexplained: the number of confused and mournful comments in the game's community hub tell the tale. Lichdom begs to have an excel spreadsheet built into it's interface.  The game is basically Serious Sam - a corridor shooter pitting the player against utterly mindless suicidal enemies, punctuated by occasional boss fights. Despite an A-List voice cast the overtones of a narrative are laughable - small player activated scenes are placed directly in your path to tell the tale entirely with ghostly visions of the past, and in fact can be completely bypassed, begging the question of why the team spent the money on the talent. The world itself is dead and empty, devoid of interaction - the levels, long and desolate, filled only with the morönic screams of your suicidal foes. The game world and mechanics feel so streamlined that it's sacrificed any character it may once have possessed.   That leaves the fighting. The number of people unable to get past the first boss fight should be telling. There's no guidance presented in game, leaving you to spend hours analyzing the spell crafting system, read guides, or (most commonly it seems, based on the comments section) simply attempt trial and error with the game's ponderous crafting system and hope for the best. It seems like the developers decided to continue adding more layers and systems to their game as development wore on, adding more complexity to the crafting, more stages to the boss fights, when that time might have been better spent adding more character to their world, or trying to tell an engaging story.  As it is I think they've crafted a very niche product for themselves and greatly limited their success. The only thing to keep you interested in playing the game is the act of crafting new spells itself. There's no compelling plot, no new areas to explore.   If keeping the steam overlay open to research your spells and calculate modifiers sounds like a delight, this is the game for you. If you were expecting a visceral action trip, look elsewhere.",

            "review_text": "Lichdom suffers from it's own design.  The premise is simple. Design your own spells using the parts received by killing in combat. Easy enough, right? There's even a Smart Craft systen in place if you can not be arsed to deal with the more complicated crafting system.  Only... the game punishes you, especially on harder difficulties, for not doing so. In fact, trying to learn and experiment is never really encouraged because your resources are finite and the new elements you unlock start with weakly powered versions. It's incredibly disappointing to find out a certain element doesn't work together well with the others. Which makes choosing them (an irreversible choice) all the more disappointing. Guess you'll have to suffer through your terrible build for another chapter and see if you can get lucky!  Now, truth be told, that issue could be alleviated with proper information. But at the time of writing, Googling answers for specific questions is absolutely ineffective. The best you can find is the same articles explaining the basics of the game you already know. I get it, charge up damage with the one skill and activate it all with a damage skill. BUT WHAT DOES THE SKULL DO? (apparently the Necromancy's skull, will fully negate any damage during block for a period, a fresh steam guide had to inform me of that)  If you want a game where you can mindlessly be a mage, this game is not for you. It's not 'Skyrim 2, the linear hallway shooter.' Sticking to the classic setup will not carry you, even if you use Smart Cast to upgrade the levels. (which is a huge waste of resources by the way) No, instead you need to figure out the best synergies with, again, too few information on any of them. And the information provided often proves confusing. The game simply makes poor work of conveying the information regarding it's mechanics.  Fine, you start experimenting. Hey, some combinations work and some elements are interesting in concept. It's like the game wants to reward you for thinking for yourself! Only, they barely prove to be viable when the combat really gets heated. Which can suddenly happen, as well. You'll be pitted against Bosses and Minibosses that, for some reason, are perfectly capable of withstanding your combo. Freeze is ineffective, Fire doesn't do enough damage... Meanwhile their skills overpower you and you can't figure out why you can't even dodge them.  The excuse that is being made then, when complaining about the bosses, is that you can actually easily beat these bosses with SPECIFIC COMBATIONS. This goes against the idea that you can craft any combation of spells in this game. Yes, you can craft them, but very few will be viable on long term and you won't even realize your combination is faulty until you've respawned 10 times wondering if you're just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dodger.  The game really doesn't inform you well on HOW you died either, or what is to blame. Just that you took enough damage (or with some cleary overpowered enemies, just take ONE hit right as they spawn) and died. You can't even look around for a final glimpse. The lack of information, more than anything, is what infuriates me. It took me five respawns (not counting the respawns just trying to get to that point) to realize that it was a huge worm spawning in a direction I never was looking in, spitting it's insanely powered, slowing goop. Leaving me up as prey for the crocodile-like creatures to be chewed on and knocked back. Dear God, I shudder at the idea of being knocked back AND frozen at the same time.  Lichdom: Battlemage has an insanely interesting concept and completely falls flat on executing it by making only a specific set of combinations strong enough to take on anything. That counters creativity, a game that shamelessly says it WANTS you to create and experiment. What use are a 100 combinations when only 2 work?  The worst thing is, in some cases it's just the default spells being underpowered and you just need to craft a better version. But when that's not the case, you just wasted resources on an element that you won't end up using anyway, and have to go back to your slightly underpowered elements you were using before. Praying some enemies may drop some Rare parts that you can use. It's not fun to constantly die just to pick up scraps. Especially considering that dying once will reset the rarity chance, meaning that once you start losing, you'll have to get lucky or scrape by.  Storywise... It's nothing to write home about. You can pick between a male or a female. The character, then nicknamed Dragon, gets wronged by an Antagonist and is joined by a the other charater now nicknamed Gryphon. Then you go on a tour of destruction through several settings while the plot dumbs down to 'follow the trail to your target and kill them at the end'.  If you can deal with constantly respawning with no satisfaction or feeling of progress, the game might be worth it. Yes, indeed, the crafting is interesting and it's probably a lot of fun on the easiest difficulty where efficiency doesn't matter a single bit. Doubt it'll be challenging or satisfying. But if you want to get serious and play a harder difficulty, you'll need information that's poorly conveyed and hard to find on your own.  What use is innovation if it's poorly implemented.",

I played a lot of complicated games, seldom used tutorials and always learned really fast how to use all features to my best advantage. But in most of the games, learning new stuff is fun! In this game, it is frustrating, confusing and overall doesnt feel right. Its like forced learning a school topic you really dont like.  Lichdom calls you a mighty battle mage. You dont! You always have to run away, run in circles, walk backwards, blink, blink more and most of all...why the ... is your blinking ability only forward, while 90% of your combat movement is backwards. Have they even played their own game?  No cooldowns. And why cant I use my blink as often as I like?  Using spells like cooking a soup. First you dot them, then you dot them, then, when they start pulsating, you blast them away with a damage attack. While having normal attack powers, a big part of the game is about spell combos, that marks enemys with debuffs, so if you finally hit them with your damage spell, they get impressive bonus damage and instantly explode with great amount of overdamage that actually activate synergy attacks. I dont know what that is, because I never manage to activate such a thing. Like that, every combat is a big quick time event, where you always have to do the same thing. No combat tactics, no cover, no use of terrain.  Last and I think least, the developers are really in love with themselves, which is the worst, that can happen to a creative mind. Never loose the ability to criticize your own work, or taking critics. When I opened a thread about the dull combat and bloated crafting system, they told me (and others) like 'go back playing COD if you dont like this'. Thanks a lot. Never played COD. I played good RPG games like NwN and good RTS like SC and AoE. Your game can be as challenging as it want, as long as it bores me to hell, I wont be able to finish it.",

In terms of actual gameplay and story this game however is a snore.  You are limited to only magical long range attacks, which means much of the gameplay bogs down to keeping a long distance to your enemies and firing fireballs while dodging a little. You have a shield that you can use to counter melee attacks, but that is unreliable enough that it's not worth the effort. The leveling up also feels forgettable, as I couldn't really tell the effects of what I leveled up.  The level design is also rather boring. The levels look quite pretty, but it's all just one linear and flat corridor. The environments are extremely constrained and there is nothing to explore. You don't even have a jump mechanic, so you don't even get proper verticality.  The story is told via ghost-sequences, you press a button and then watch the sequence play out, before going back to shooting monsters with your fireball to find the next thing to press. This makes the story feel extremely disconnected from the actual gameplay and frankly I have a hard time telling what is even going on for that reason, as none of those ghostly figures mean anything to be. Them being all blue doesn't help with recognizability either.  The bosses also deserve a special mention, they have no attack pattern, weak points or much of anything that would make them interesting. They are just big enemies with a lot of health, it takes forever to even make a noticeable dent into their healthbar. To make the bosses more difficult the game also just spawns hords of regular enemies while you fight the boss. I gave up on the game on the second boss, as it just became to frustrating and pointless to bother with this game.   So overall, a polished game that is extremely repetitive and just plain boring. I am only 5h into the game at this point and there are plenty of magic spells I haven't yet unlocked, so maybe it gets better later on, but these 5h so far were spend essentially doing the same thing over and over again.",

The game didn't turn out quite the way I hoped... it just feels oddly sluggish and not like the explosion of badassness it was supposed to be. It's like a cumbersome, unwieldy version of Painkiller; not as fast and not as much fun... sadly. If only the gameplay matched the graphics. Unfortunately the nice visuals are on top of some fairly lacklustre and badly paced gameplay.  Edit: After toying around with settings I conclude that the game performs abysmally on NVIDIA hardware (GTX 670 (OC)) [i7-4770K, 16 GB RAM]. Lichdom also has the worst vsync implementation ever... anything even slightly below 60 fps is dropped to a stuttering 30 fps.

            "review_text": "I like the concept but I can't really recommend this game - or at least not at full price. It's not a bad game but I didn't find it particularly good either.  The story is pretty basic, as least as far as I got. You, Generic Townsperson, were hanging out doing one day doing townsfolky things when your relative was tragically killled by Lord Evilguy and his evil followers, the Cult of Evil. You then gain magic powers and set out to kill Lord Evilguy and avenge your beloved &lt;InsertRelativeNameHere&gt;. There are a few other cutscenes along the way but they don't seem to tell us much we don't already know.  Level design is also fairly straightforward - the entire game seems to be one long corridor with the occasional short sidepath, although it looks decent enough.  The combat is clearly the meat of the game, but for me it just wasn't that interesting. A lot of people who like the game will claim that if someone doesn't like the combat, it's because they're 'doing it wrong' - they don't know how to combine spells properly and just throw the one fireball spell over and over. In my case I don't think that's true. I've seen the videos, I've read a couple of guides, I'm using the mastery and control spells, I'm using my blink and block, and I still dodn't find it terribly exciting.  Generally, spells work best if you charge them up a bit, and it usually takes several spells to kill an enemy - at the very least, applying 'mastery' (which increases the power of subsequent hits) and/or a control spell before going for damage is normal. Combine with the fact that the game doesn't really require precision aim - the standard bolt spell actually homes in on enemies! - and combat felt a little sluggish to me.  Compounding this is that there is a  lot  of combat, but all the enemies and environments seem to be basically the same. Once you've got your combos down, the only thing that brings any variety to combat is that enemies spawn with random 'affixes', similar to the unique monsters in games like Diablo or Path of Exile. This make choosing which enemies to prioritise important - which I assume is what they were aiming for, since there's not a huge emphasis on manual dexterity - but I didn't find it enough to prevent combat become repetitive fairly quickly. Some of the spell effects are pretty flashy if you like that sort thing, however.  The other major part of the game is the crafting system, which is potentially interesting but more of a chore than it needs to be. Prepare to spend a lot of time on inventory management, because you're going to amass large piles of junk which you'll need to sort though using an interface which could be better. Again, it's not the worst but it could have been better. If you're really into min-maxing and comparing stats you'll probably love it, though.  Overall I think this game is competent but underwhelming. It doesn't really have glaring faults, but I just couldn't get into it. If you love flashy special effects or complicated crafting systems and don't mind a bit of repetition you might get more out of it than I did.",

            "review_text": "Lets get this TL;DR out of the way for those that don't have the time to read my wall of text bellow:  GOOD: + Nice graphics and effects.  + OK voice acting.  + Smart craft.  + Loot rarity system.  BAD: - Did not feel like a bad-♥♥♥ mage at all, not even once.  - Combat is a grind that gets old very quick. - Crafting system is a pain. - NG+ is boring and feels pointless. - Boss fights to easy. - Levels are way to long. - Did I mention combat is a grind fest?  RECOMMENDATION: Want to feel like a bad-♥♥♥ mage? Go play Dragons Dogma on ps3 or xbox 360.   REVIEW:  First time I saw the trailer for this game I thought that this will be a nice game where I will feel like a bad-♥♥♥ mage plowing through enemies ala Serious Sam. As you can see by the big red thumb down I was disappointed... So very dissappointed.  Lets start with the positive. The environments are absolutely beautiful and apart from the levels being way to long each level has it's own unique environment. Nice models for enemies and effects are good. Also the smart craft menu is awesome. The loot rarity system is also nice  There are some really nice ideas in this game, to bad they are so poorly executed.  The biggest flaw of the game is the fact that they promised the feeling of being a bad-♥♥♥ mage and it's not delivered. Maybe I had some high expectations but if you tell me that this game made you feel like a almighty bad-♥♥♥ mage and nothing could stand in your way, then you have not played a lot of games as a mage. I feel more powerful rolling a wizard in Diablo 3 then I did playing Lichdom: Battlemage. The game promised me no cooldowns but instead I have to 'load' every spell for two seconds for it to have any effect at all on the enemies, I'd rather have the cooldowns.  Add to that, the ridiculous amount of overkills you have to achieve to get any sigil to maximum level. The leveling system for the sigils (fire, ice, lightning etc.) doesn't help the feeling of NOT being a bad-♥♥♥ with the stupid and utterly pointless rule that you can't level more then three at a time and when you want to change to another sigil, you will reset the level of the sigil you remove. If I'm suppose to be a bad-♥♥♥ mage, why can't I keep the level on my sigils? Some say that what you get for leveling a sigil is a very small bonus and not really worth it which only makes the system even more pointless!  Now I played this game as I do any game, at the hardest difficulty setting which probably didn't help the feeling of grinding as if this was an Asian MMO. The thing is that, when I completed the game and moved on to NG+ I lowered the difficulty to get away from some of the grind but the amount of HP the enemies had didn't seem to be affected at all, I still felt like every fight was like trying to push down a brick wall by blowing on it.  The ridiculous crafting system is also a problem. The actual crafting system isn't that hard to understand, the problem is when you choose materials for the spells. The attribute lists on the materials are often to long and I always felt unsure if the spell I crafted was better or worse then the ones I already have. Especially since the game never really told me what all of the attributes are. Instead I used the smart crafting system. It just tells you that ou can craft a more powerful spel and then you do!  As I mentioned before the difficulty scale is a bit off and I often had more problems with normal mobs than with the boss fights. Although the boss fights where cool they where never really hard and it was often more of a challenge getting to the boss fight then getting through it.  The story is not the worst I ever saw, it's OK. It's the 'bad-guy-wronged-me-and-I-want-revenge' type of story.  If you're still with me and you want to feel like a bad-♥♥♥ wizard then go play something else, like Dragon's Dogma. There you have some spells that actually makes you feel almighty.",

            "review_text": "----WARNING, WALL OF TEXT INCOMING!!----  I expected more. I expected to be a badass mage, flinging cool (and sometimes silly) custom spells around. There are 3 variants of spell modifier for 2 of the 3 spell types, with 8 'Sigils' (magic types), and Destrution, Control, and Mastery effects for each. Sounds good, right? It's not, and that is because Destruction, Control, and Mastery have no effect on the apperance of your spells, Destruction = Damage, Control = Influencing enemies(dmg over time, stuns, etc.), and Mastery = Enemies take increased damage.  The spell modifiers only change how the effect is delivered ( a continous stream, a grenade like effect, homing missles, etc.) Each Sigil type is nice, excluding the over-done and over-used types of Fire and Ice. You have a Aoe spell (think traps), your thrown spells, and Novas (what happens when you use a charged blink). Basically the spells aren't anywere near as customizable as they should be. Also you can only use 1 Sigil type per both hands, no dual-wielding differnt spell types.  Shield's are stupid, there are 3 types of shields. 1-Agile, quick blinks and charged blinks, low damage block, low shield. 2-Tactical, charged blinks, medium damage block, medium shield. 3-Strategic,3 quick blinks (has recharge), high damage block, high shield. My problem with them is that I can't use any of them. Agile is fast enough, but lacts the shield I need, while strategic has enough shield but isn't fast enough. Tactical is just stupid, mainly because I can't dodge last second.  The enemies are annoying, and make things like boss fights ridiculously tedious. Most of my deaths in this game have involved trying to take shortcuts through levels (which are all very linear btw) or being stunlocked by ranged enemies till the boss finally connects with a hit (usually a insta/near insta-kill even on lower difficulties).  I've only been to about 4 locations in the game if you include the tutorial. I could not find a single shortcut through these levels, considering there is no jump button, and 4 ft falls kill you. These levels (excluding the tutorial) are overly long, and very tedious.  If you want a nice to look at game with good magic effects, here it is. I'd rather much prefer something that actually gave me insanely customizable spells, with fun game mechanics.",

It boasts very damage-spongey enemies and it doesn't feel at all like you're the powerful mage you're made out to be. You have slightly creative control over what kind of spells you can create: you can pick three 'elements' to equip, which essentially function as your guns in any other FPS. Each 'gun' has a normal fire mode - which can be set to a ray, cluster-grenade or bolt, an alt fire mode - which is an AOE grenade, trip-mine or lasting effect like a gas grenade, and a shield - which when timed correctly causes splash damage in front of you. It's a neat idea, and quickly switching between the three elements you chose can help stack damage or cause interesting effects. Unfortunately, even the weakest enemies really soak up tons of damage and you mostly find yourself repeating the same cycle of attacks over and over, once you've found a few spells that feel the least flimsy.  You walk a linear route and every 50 meters you enter another arena where you instantly become locked-in with force fields and enemies spawn out of thin air until the arena is considered completed. There's no way to tell how much damage you've done, which enemy is almost dead, or how many enemies you have left until that little section is complete. Then the force fields disappear and you can continue walking down the linear path for 50 meters until the next set of force fields pop up and enemies start spawing in front of your face again. Out of boredom I eventually snapped up a trainer, and even with unlimited health, quickly leveling spells and instantly powered-up charges (hold the mouse button down for a second and your spell becomes 'more powerful'), you STILL feel weak and even the weakest enemies take 5 to ten spells to die. A properly crafted fireball with all your best 'epic' runes won't even make a little wobbly skelleton flinch. I'd really rather take a pistol and pop a hole in it's skull than muck around with flamboyant attempts to trap, freeze and then roast every reanimated skelleton that teleports in front of me every few seconds. There's some very lazy game design going on here and I'd steer clear of it. Lichdom is a pretty but poor execution of a good idea.  If you DO enjoy this game, even remotely, you'll probably have a lot more fun in God Mode. It's similar in that it has arenas to progress through, but it doesn't pretend to have a boring story and it doesn't dress up regular gun-play as something it's not. God Mode is focused on arena combat with guns, where aiming for a head-shot actually makes a difference. And the most fun thing about it? You can play it with friends. Lichdom's only claim to fame is the focus on magic, but if you play it for a few minutes, you'll poke right through that and realize you feel more like a guy weilding very unhandy, weak, flaming-potato slingshots than a wizard.",
