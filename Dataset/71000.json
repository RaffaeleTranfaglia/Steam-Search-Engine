            "review_text": "Ok i bought this game during the summer sale and so far I like it!  The Good! Open world.. You can do what you want to do if you have some imagination!  A large mapped out universe with safe systems.. Not so safe systems.. And just down right Angry systems!  Even more systems that arn't mapped out... Not sure how many so far, I have only found a few of them and their hard to find which is a good thing! Remember Space is a big place so it shouldn't be to easy to find everything!   You can Generate space stations in locations you chose that arn't to close to other stations.. Gives you a tactical advantige or a trading benifit, howerver you wish to use it! Thats kinda up to you to figure out!  You can Mine, Trade, Do Missions from a mission board, or just Pirate cargo from NPC ships to make credit's  Guessing 30 plus spacecraft frames to chose from..Or upgrade to with in game credits if you can find a station that has them!  Upgradeable engins, cargo bays, wings, fuel tanks and Sheilds if you can afford them!  A really Neat wepons lab where you can craft your own version of the perfect Beam or Partical wepons!  A hanger in most stations where you can store a frame for later use..... For a price of course!  Good flight model with inerta or thrust driven modes and even an in atmosphere mode.  Custimazable enough controlls without being just way to much and confusing!  Can land on planets and planet base Locations.  Can fly inside some very large astroids and find some lootable stuff!  Can get a Mech Walker and walk planetside or even fight planetside if you can find something to fight!  Good bit of tech to buy in the stations and with limited space it make's you think and make desisions on how you want your ship to performe, Not enough room for everything so you have to decide whats important for the way you want to play.. The largest ships in the game cant carry everything even! and thats a good thing, makes you think!  I have read some reviews about a hard learning curve.... This is my first space sim since Tie Fighter and it took a while to learn but it wasn't bad and that was part of the fun in my opinion!  Theirs more good stuff but just cant remember it all!  The Bad! Making credits is to easy once you figure out where to buy low and sell high... Some players think you have to find the lost city but you can make credits really easy just paying attition to prices... On my second Pilot I made 50 Million in just a few hours of game play because I had figured it out on my first pilot.. Needs to be a bit harder to make credits so you can't just get the best gear so quick!  TO HARD TO FIND OTHER REAL PLAYERS TO PLAY WITH.... I have managed to log onto a multiplayer server but I was the only player on it :( Would be nice if you could find others to play with! Seems like not to many people play multiplayer sadly..It might be fun!  Not enough Places to store loot in the hangers...Yes you can use multiable hangers in multible Space Ports but Dang their expensive and a pain being so spread out... Would like to see them let you chose a hanger locaion or build a Space Port to use as your home base and let you store multable ships and alot of looted and Pillaged goodies!   Can't figure out how to create my own Guild? Would be neat if you could start your own guild then search out an uncharted galaxy... then build it up with Ports and stuff and have your own guild Galaxy, If you could name it that would be even cooler but some peeps would do some real silly names I relize sadly!  If you lack Imagination... You will probably get bored after a while... Persionally I keep trying to find new stuff and tinkering around to see what i can do.... I'm still learning the deepth of the game!  Anyway all in all it has been fun even if I havent got to play multiplayer yet! But maybe someone will see this review and we can find a server and start building a universe!  Sleepy",

            "review_text": "An excellent space combat simulator that has all the bells and whistles of most AAA titles; except it's made by one person. Don't blow this off as some clone or half-♥♥♥♥♥ attempt; this will give everyone who enjoys space combat sims plenty of entertainment. It may not be as polished or in-depth as games like Elite Dangerous or Star Citizen; but it is  complete , and works 100%.  The star system is vast, mostly contained within our own Milkyway galaxy. I don't think any person has enough time to completely explore the whole area; as it would take thousands and thousands of hours to do so. There are many unexplored areas that are left for the player to find on their own; but there are plenty of 'inhabited' planets and sectors in between to keep you busy.   There are planets with terrain, atmosphere, bases, vegetation, and resources that you will also need to explore, either by ship or on foot. You can customize your vessel almost however you want; from re-arranging the chassis and different sections, to customizing weapon platforms and even your character/crew.  The only 'cons' that I have is the small (but active) community, and slow (but consistant) progress to perfection. However, these are easily forgivable since they are mostly my opinion, and theres still 1000x more to this game than just multiplayer and eye-candy.  There's really too much to write about, and I have barely scratched the surface. It's best to support a great and dedicated developer and see for yourself! It's cheap, and even goes on sale from time to time. Check out the official forums and SeeJay's www site for starcharts, information, and mods.",

            "review_text": "A fairly good game with some nice ideas. It's a bit like Freelancer, but a little more 'real' and more involved. The multiplayer is where the majority of the fun is at, but you will find it lacks depth. Once you have enough money to buy the best ship in the game (which does not take long at all), you will struggle to find anything to do except explore.  The control of your ship never seems quite right, and you find yourself constantly 'sliding' everywhere. I have no problem playing space games with inertial dampeners off, but something about this just feels wrong - it takes forever to make course changes if you have any kind of speed.  The developer is absolutely brilliant though. I visited their forums to ask some questions and instantly got a reply from the developer, who implemented a new mechanic to the game based on my questions and feedback. I was stunned at how welcoming and kind the community is for this game. That alone is worth its weight in gold.  A good game, that could be a great game.  Jimbo Rating: 6/10",

            "review_text": "This game gets a 'must buy' rating from me for anyone who is interested in this genre of spaceflight simulation/comba/trading game. The realistic newtonian physics model and controls are so much better than the status quo 'airplane physics in space' in practically every other similar game, and you really can seamlessly fly down onto a planet's surface! And you really can fly anywhere between solar systems without jump gates, though it would take 100s of jumps without a 'special' hard to find type of jump drive. All of this is done very well.  The main drawback of the game is that lots of areas feel kind of lacking in depth. For example, you can craft things and customize your ship but there isn't that much variety. You can land on planets and stations looking for missions or things to buy, but there are no characters with scripted conversations to talk to. Capital ships aren't very detailed or specialized, and are more like scaled-up very slow versions of fighters with lots of hit points. Basically there are lots of things you can do that you can't do in other games, but not that much intracacy in any particular part of the game.  Stll, I think most people who are interested in this sort of game will want to spend at least 10s if not 100s of hours playing it. So it's worth buying at full price, especially with multiplayer support (which honestly I haven't tried yet.)",

Space combat is very dynamic, sometimes not so easy, trade is simple, but may be dangerous, mining, crafting and stations building are fine, missions as well, You can do whatever You like, even spending hours only exploring uncharted systems and trying to raise reputation among the forgotten and hostile colonists, if You find them.",

This game features tones of things that I think should be essential to all space sims: an open sandbox world, multiplayer, planetary reentry, and customizable ships to name a few. Not only can you toggle in and out of Newtonian physics, but doing so is an essential element of combat in this game.  Also, the game is constantly expanding. A while back, they added terrestrial mechs that you can pilot, once you land on a planet. Space stations also got a nice functional and cosmetic update. I look forward to what new features may be released int the future.",

I'm not sure if I'm the guy to ask about this game, but I can tell you what I know/ how aI play.   I find this game is very relaxing. Poor myself a glass of whisky, get some snacks and put on my own music. A new player will have to take a crash course in controls and such, so be in the mood for some learning the first time.  Once you know the buttons, it's time to head out into space and get a job. Because if you want to travel faster and further you need better parts for your ship. At first, the jobs are cleaning and pick-up/delivery. Once you think you're good enough you can race and fight other AI ships. I never got good enough to stand a chance, though.  So, I just fly around in space, check out planets, pick up some things here and there to sell and chill. It's like Train Simulator in space. Landing on/ taking off from planets and docking (&gt;ᴗ&lt; Pfft) at space stations is really cool as you can be all finicky about maneuvering and speed.  Word of advice: don't run out of gas...! Though it was excellent when I went Online, sent out a S.O.S. and a friendly stranger came to my coordinates to lend me some. The few that still play, are very friendly.",

The interface is poorly constructed and counter intuitive. The trade system is unbalanced and easily manipulated. (I had 250 million credits in 5 hours of play) This takes all the excitement out of playing. With 250 million credits, I could afford everything in the game. The combat controls are terrible. I'm a person who favors game mechanics and story content over beautiful graphics so I would not, normally, mention the graphics quality. Unfortunately, this game excel in none of these areas and the graphics would have been aweful in 2001. The potential of this game is there. With a team of programmers and six months of overhual, it could really be something. At this time I have to advice people not to waste their money.

I've shredded millions of credits on different ship ideas and the like, but occasionally no matter what I do, inertia pulls me out of the rings and I lose the race. Period. Big ships, small ships, wings, engines - doesn't matter. I can't win that race. Maybe there's a way to cheat it or something I can find on the forums, but this is FRUSTRATING.  2) Mining is mining, and it's fine, but there's not much to it. There's an outpost with an asteroid about 700 out from gate 4. Pretty sweet spot to pile up credits. On a lark, I tried warping over to the hostile space next door. Got killed a lot, but eventually jumped away to a much riskier asteroid field. What did I find, mining in this new hotbed? Same stuff as the asteroid right outside the gate.  Maybe I just need to start a new pilot and try a different career, but at this point I'm worried I'll hit the same sort of dead end.",

Even though that tactic makes alot of money I still get a paranoid feeling of running out of fuel in the middle of nowhere becoming perma-stuck. This game makes you think you can freely explore,but I have never felt so confined. If fuel wasn't a factor this could be enjoyable to play. I tried going multiplayer a couple of times but the servers are down or something. The whole game experience has been utter crap boring to me. Which is why I wouldn't recommend.  Update:Trying to give it more of a chance.After making over half a billion credits I've experienced more of this game.This game seems to really depend on how you are.If you're patient you will get some rewards.Making money is the big secret first,then customizing your ship to your needs.The physics in this is Newtonian,so combat can become a drift in and out of range firing.Combat is really tough to get used to if you never played space-sim with newtonian physics. Final word is this game takes doing some homework or alot of trial and error.If you are looking for a game to mess with like X3 look somewhere else this isn't it. If you are looking for a challenging game that takes knowledge and skill this is for you.
