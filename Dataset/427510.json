            "review_text": "  Disclaimer: Beta Tester    As someone who played the 4th game 1st before the 3rd, it does take a bit getting used to but you will appreciate WOTS 3 for its freedom and at times its brutality.  You are a penniless ronin who wakes up in a poor village. As you look around, you'll find a number of groups citing about what is best for the people and themselves. The game is somewhat somber in its setting than its 4th game as a war looms around and many hash battles passes right at the beginning.  For new players to WOTS, sometimes its not clear about what is the best choice but getting to the endings is part of the WOS series to gain points for your next playthrough so feel free to choose how you feel 1st. While time passes in this game, the requirements for story events are not that strict (like WOS4). Your map would tell where the events are so keep looking at it as time goes on.  The combat system is actually very easy to pick up but hard to master especially when in many situations you're often surrounded, my advice would be to get good at blocking, avoiding and partner with combat girls.  At certain times of the day, you will meet up with girls. Some girls are into combat and give you combos to learn while others may give extra money but they can also steal money or your food. So choose your girls wisely. Some even hilariously choose blind colored kimonos! Of course you need to fulfill their special requirements 1st... Best girl in the beginning: Momiji  And no, you can't sleep with the girls like in WOTS4.  In between the story events, there are quests to do for your poor beggar. But even if you fail, the quest will come up again. Some will be quests for taking down criminals or people the client disagrees with while others are 'Find the person/item' quests which be in a different location each time.  Tip: Don't let anyone bump into you or you might lose your precious yen. Yen is actually the part where you have to grind for (quests, selling items) as katana upgrades can get expensive...  Graphics wise, it might have aged a bit but nothing deters you from enjoying it. 30 FPS locked (but still brutal in combat). The OST fits the mood but I can only find a few that sticks with me.  As a beta tester, I was surprised that it was hard to find bugs so kudos to the team! *Using Windows 7*  8.1/10 (This rating might be due to how used to I was in WOTS4 if not it would probably be higher)  ______________  Were there any things I missed you wish to know?

            "review_text": "EDIT- Well I've got it working now after some help from the internet. It's pretty much exactly the same as the 360 version that I loved but with the addition of a few glitches, the aforementioned impossibility of playing Swordplay Theater still being there (even when I rebind the keys, it just does not work, I can never even TRY to catch the sword), as well as some audio ♥♥♥♥-ups here and there (sometimes during cutscenes audio from DIFFERENT cutscenes will play, usually the previous one. It's kinda funny sometimes, but it doesn't affect me much since I know pretty much all of them anyways so I skip them most of the time), and I've had a couple more crashes here and there but they're mostly the exception, most of the time I can get a solid few hour session in and it doesn't crash.  I guess I tentatively recommend this game if only because it's still a good game, but be forewarned that there's a good chance it won't run on your PC if you install it as-is. If you don't want to bother with any tinkering with files at the behest of interweb wizards, then you probably want to look elsewhere.  Original review:  Ughhhh... you'd think I'd have learned from Way of the Samurai 4 that Acquire and Ghostlight are terrible with PC ports... sadly it seems that much like them, I have much to learn.  Now I loved Way of the Samurai 3 on the 360, it was my overall favorite of the series- 4 had some nice improvements, but as a whole 3 is my favorite, so naturally I was excited when I saw it was seeing a release on Steam... though also reluctant since 4 was pretty glitchy, though after a while they patched it so that it was at least playable (finally adding controller support was nice). So I figured I'd wait a bit until after launch before getting this one, thinking they'd have already patched it... shame about that though.  Enter Way of the Samurai 3, I've managed to play for about 2.5 hours of mostly dicking around getting money and not bothering much with triggering events since I wanted to get a better sword ASAP... it's just a shame that it suddenly crashed when I loaded one of the areas I've been to a dozen times already- ok, no problem, I saved fairly recently... it's just a shame that the game crashes whenever I try to load that save, so I've already lost all my progress. I suppose it's fortunate that I've only put less than 3 hours into it, but add insult to injury it now also crashes whenever I try to start a new game so now I can't do anything besides load up the main menu and think of what could be if I could actually play the damn game.  I didn't notice any other outstanding glitches in my playtime (other than once it altogether refused my controller's input, but that was solved fairly easily by just restarting the game; and I could never actually catch the sword in swordplay theater despite being fairly good at it on the 360... it just refused to let me catch the damn sword so I always got my face sliced), but then I only had a few hours with it so that doesn't mean much, there's probably more I haven't had the chance to see.  Much as I love these games, these guys really don't know what they're doing when it comes to PC ports. Would not recommend, and just like with 4 it hurts me to say that since I really love these games, it's just the PC ports are so shoddy that I can't recommend them in good conscience.",

I like everything about the game, except the capped at 30fps. you can go into the ini files and change the setting, but that messes up the fighting. you can no longer really hit anything with your attacks. apparently the fighting is tied to the framerate.   unfortunately the 30fps looks so bad and choppy i cannot enjoy the game, and therefore cannot recommend it.  which makes me sad, as the gamplay looks amazing.",

It has the same charm and allure of Majora's Maks in terms of characters and locations, and a solid soundtrack.   At $15 you can hardly lose, try it out!",
