            "review_text": "I've played my share of shooting games, while my wife (non-gamer) has seldom played the genre. We just played 2P Co-op and had a lot of fun! She felt challenged but learned the mechanics and game system quickly. We were literally sweating after our second run.  If you are into arcade shooters, especially if you love local multiplayer, this game will definitely keep you entertained with friends. We don't have one more extra player, but 3-player mode is definitely worth exploring.",
