Now i found one level quite interesting and having the potential of becoming in itself a game - i mean really on it's own for VR. It's the climbing challange - and i am sure everyone else would agree that it would be awesome if you could release a title for the VR with this kind of climbing challanges - time trial and the graphics involved here. I would have loved to have a bunch of levels in climbing challange and to be multiplayer challanges as well - coop - race etc... Other than that i highly recommend the game. A few twicks here and there for the basktball challange for instance and baseball regarding physics. but that i could discuss in private. Cheers!",
