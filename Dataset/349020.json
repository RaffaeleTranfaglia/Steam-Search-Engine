This brings back the old days of Space Cadet on your old-♥♥♥ Windows desktop that weighed more than you, while also mixing in some more challenges and fun. The game itself is somewhat difficult for me, but I just suck at games like these. I recommend this game for anyone. I will most likely be addicted to it. I love how the developer is just taking the classic pinball concept and friggin' sprinting with it. The game is amazing so far, and the introduction is just flawless. I got this for free, but it is worth the five dollars. I implore you. Buy this game.",

            "review_text": "The game is a simplistic mix of Pinball and Asteroids. Plays rather well, except the one little thing that ruins the whole experience. The gap between the flippers is way too huge. You will way too often end into the situation when your ball falls directly between the flippers and you can't save the day. This is a huge problem, especially when the game is random driven. Often the random rock will spawn in front of the ball and will ricochet it... where? Correct! Right in the middle. It takes no skill. It requires you too have a huge rabbit foot wrapped in three-leaf clovers on your neck.",

            "review_text": "Meant to post this a while back, but steam was being cranky and didn't let me so here goes again:  Hyperspace Pinball is awesome, I had a great time with it. I love pinball and innovative games, and this is both.  It's obviously not a sim and it's faster than normal pinball, but the physics are good and my real life skills translated well.  There are several modes and leaderboards, but the campaign mode is the meat of the game. There you destroy enemies until you open a timed portal to the next level, advancing until you reach the final boss. The new levels gradually change the layout of the table and the enemies you fight, with boss battles and bonus rounds every few. The further you get the harder the enemies are to kill, eventually getting shields and even firing back at you with little lasers that can knock your ball off course. It's a really fun time and a good challenge, and after I beat the campaign I kept coming back to try for a higher score.   Although the tables may look pretty bare and seem to focus on fighting enemies, there are plenty of things to make score chasing fun that you won't notice at first:  There's various challenges you start by hitting all the drop targets, a mini-jackpot you get by lighting all the letters in the word bonus above the bumpers, enemy combos, a flawless victory bonus for not losing a ball on a level, a jackpot minigame where you have to hit the weak spot on a big enemy spacecraft, and power-ups you get by hitting a moving target (2x score, increase jackpot, ball save, multi-ball, increase ball strength to better kill enemies, etc).  Also the dev seems really cool, responded to me on the forums quickly and was open to feedback and suggestions about the game, and is still putting out new updates.  I would definitely recommend this to any pinball fan looking for a new kind of pinball experience... ...or to anyone who knew, deep down in their heart, that one glorious day their pinball skills would save the galaxy.",
