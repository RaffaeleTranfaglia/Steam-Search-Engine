    "description": "The King almost died. Pierre and Olivier tasted the Kings’ meal and later it was fed to the prisoners – and no man felt anything wrong. Strength and mind are leaving the noble ruler every minute, and enemies are ready to raise a rebellion, while the King is on the verge of life and death.",
