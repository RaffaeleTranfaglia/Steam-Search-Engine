            "review_text": "Considering this was made by two people, I think this game was very well done. There is obvious love for games like Amnesia all over this, so if you like games like that, than this would be a good pick. The game looks decent, with an original locale. Asylums, prisons, and crumbling castles have had their go...now for a museum! The puzzles are not that difficult which for this game I think is a good thing. While the monsters are something slightly borrowed from Amnesia, the game overall fills you with a kind of dread, and I like that. There's the occasional monster, but the whole game is filled with tension, wondering whats going to be in the next room. The story is told through.....you guessed it!....notes scattered around the museum and other areas. There are a few original ideas, but the ones that are borrowed from other games and lore are also good. This is a fun game with a lot of effort put into it, and I'm glad I played it.",

The Atlantis exhibit fills up with water?)  CONS: -Only one type of enemy -Has backstory, but no present story (had no idea who I was or why I was even there) -AI is terrible -Flashlight batteries are useless -Not very exciting  I recommend it if you have nothing to do and want a good laugh.",

            "review_text": "Astray is a first-person puzzle/horror game that I have yet to complete, because it's a scary game and I was too scared to continue on and finish the game, but I took interest in it, and kept going with it, because it's also a puzzle game, and it looks nice too. Will probably finished it at a later date, I feel like I'm almost at the end, but here's my thoughts on it so far.  Like I said, it looks really pretty, shiny and illuminating, and the atmosphere feels good time, silent and creepy, with most of the structures in the game feeling majestic and kind of awesome.  The puzzles are nice, with some of them physics based, and most of them aren't hard to finish, it's somewhat pretty much in your face, but your mind bends to make you think it's hard, but they are decent, not overly complicated, and overall nice.  The scary part of the game, is it's somewhat tense atmosphere, and the structure of the game that makes it scary, with a creature following you in a level from time to time, that actually doesn't jump at you, the game doesn't have ridiculous jump-scares, so that's good, and instead just leaves you with the game itself and the monster that's in certain sections of the game, which will surprise/scare you when you find him, and chases after you when you make the wrong move, which is being visible to him with the help of the lights.  There isn't much bad things to point out, aside from the monster that you have to be careful of, is modeled poorly with what seems like it has a low poly count.  I'm more happy with the game's majestic beautiful looks and structures, and light-tense atmosphere, rather than the horror part of it, and in the end(ish) I had a good time in it playing through it, and for the price the it has, it's a decent purchase to make if it has you interested in it. It's not a bad game, but it's not a great one either. Go into the game thinking that it's a light-horror game, with nothing special going on with it, that has good looks and light-puzzles.

            "review_text": "After completing this game, I asked for a refund. This was a frustrating game with no redeemable qualities.  There are no puzzles. You stack boxes all the time. Sometimes you look for a cog to open a door. You do a basic pipe turning mini game twice and that's as difficult as it gets.  There's a part with dynamite that took me 20 minutes and multiple deaths because the rocks, which bounce, kept pushing me through the floor or the dynamite would explode with nothing touching it.  It's not scary at all. At one point I was trapped in a room with a 'monster' and it didn't notice me, even though I made noise and the room was well lit. I was scared once in 5 hours.  I also managed to bug the game so badly I had to restart and I put a couple of chairs in the wall. Also noticed were floating objects, obviously deleted objects, and objects merging into the wall.",

            "review_text": "Overall I think this was a good effort, and I would recommend it, just at a price a tad lower than 6.99â‚¬. I experienced a few bugs, but none of them were game-breaking. For instance the physics system often has abrupt and 'violent' behaviour. Towards the end of the game my character also insisted on walking on his own in one particular direction (fix: pause + unpause). I think the game needed more polishing, for instance I think there is a distinct lack of environmental soundeffects. I.e. I can throw around rocks, boxes, ventilation grills and I never once heard a sound as a result. That really breaks the immersion. Astray is one of those games I think would have been better without an actual monster chasing after you and killing you. Those sections where you were more or less forced to interact with the monster felt not very frightening at first, and after that it just felt like a chore. I definitely preferred the first parts of the game, although I didn't care much for the demonology exhibit compared to the Egypt and Atlantis exhibits. I think the game after that needed more puzzles and the puzzles were generally too easy. For instance, I liked the idea of the puzzle in Atlantis where you had to equalize the pressure but I wish it had been made more challenging.",

Seems to have been done in a day for a 'quick buck' - no atmosphere or immersion. (Well.. how would there be any if you keep seeing the same 4 pieces of furniture over and over in locations they obviously dont belong?) - same old 'turn around the corner' jump scares with boring enemies  If at least the locations wouldnt feel as if they have been done by a 5 year old I might have given the game a chance =(",

            "review_text": "Astray is a First person Horror that follows the path marked by the Amnesia games, which can be good or bad depending on your tastes.  Gameplay side, is, as I already said, very similar to amnesia: you have your trusty flashlight, and nothing else. The monster can kill you (but not easily, they are quite slow), and there are diaries and notes around the place to tell the backstory.  Enigm and puzzles are a bit classic (the pipe puzzle is a obvious example), but enjoyable and never too much frustrating.  The plot is heavily influenced by Lovecraft's work, so expect the typical mind abusing Cosmic Horror. I don't want to spoiler anything, so I just says that the story is explained very clearly through, so there isn't to much to understand.  The Horror atmosphere is done quite well, with a few jumpscares, but none worth noting; the monsters are very simple, and not very scary, but they do their job.  The forte of Astray is his truly beautiful ambients, some rooms have an exceptional design and the light system work just fine.  There are not many bugs in this game, and it never crashed on me.  Maybe it's greatest flaw is the length: Astray is not very long, and any player can finish it in a few hours.  In short:    - Pro       Great designs     Fluid and simple gameplay     Not very expensive    Some good horror elements    - Cons       Very short (2h)    Sometimes it is not as scary as it wants to be  ",

Most of the puzzle elements are very easy, and should not pose as to much of a problem for most people. It has borrowed ideas from many survival / horror games but has not executed them quite as well. Overall, worth a look for cheap asking price and have a couple of hours to kill. 6/10.",
