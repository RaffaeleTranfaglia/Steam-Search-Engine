            "review_text": "Been having a great time with this art tool/game. It's really relaxing to just mess around in, but has a lot of depth and nuance if you dig deeper. The music also adds to the overall atmosphere the game creates. You can tell a lot of love and effort went in to the crafting of this.    Excited to see additional sea creatures and options down the line, as well as (hopefully) NEW PIXELSCAPES in the future. I'd love a forest one, or perhaps a SPACE edition. :D",
