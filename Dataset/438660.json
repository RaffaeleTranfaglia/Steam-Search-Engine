            "review_text": "  I give it a 7.5/10   Gameplay gets an 8/10 The gameplay is nuts compared to like Madden. I’m picking plays like I would in Madden but I have to think about the size of my dog and where to run because you can get a huge score by running through logs, riding skateboards and such, which are mostly on the sides of the field and give your dog a speed boost when used. To maximize points you want to use different game balls and different powerups so lots going on vs like Madden. I even found holding the right mouse button down to walk super useful on defense so I could hang back and then intercept or quickly take out a receiver. Maneuvering the QB in the pocket and then going for the QB sneak also turned out to be a pretty solid tactic. Basically Madden gets pretty stale for me in the gameplay department and Dog Football makes football worth playing with lots of tactical options and resource management to think about since game balls get destroyed and treats and balls need to be purchased and are necessary for playing well.  Graphics get a 7/10 Cartoony with a sense of realism meaning that even though the dogs look cartoony they mostly behave the way dogs would in real life. They do touchdown dances and such which are probably not always realistic but hey I’ve seen Merengue Dog so who knows. I personally like a cartoony feel so the graphics work for me and are cohesive between environments, characters, and UI. I’d still like to see a more realistic and updated look like for any future version.  Sound gets a 7/10 I like how the music is made to fit the personalities of each character. Sound effects just fit the environments so that’s fine and the dogs sound like dogs so good enough. This just doesn’t seem like the type of game where anything spectacular in the sound department is needed so seems like what is there is fitting.  Replay Value gets an 8/10 After playing a full season I was able to get everything for my team including all dog breeds and a new character and field to play. It took a while and near the end of the season the AI was bringing it so I lost a few games. I had fun trying to maximize bonus points on fields, want to beat the game with the other characters, and want to get all the gift boxes to get all the unlocks, so this has lasting appeal for me. I hope they add multiplayer because that will keep me playing longer.",
