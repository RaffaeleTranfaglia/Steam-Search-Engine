And when you compelete a level you feel a little smarter, or maybe just lucky, espesially when you finish a level on your first line placement. Not sure what is going on with the spoken dialogue, or lack of it rather, but not a game breaker. Would like to see more games from Rockodile like this.",

            "review_text": "Picked this up in the sale for ~£4.20 and have completed the game including all the bonus levels.  Overall a simple but enjoyable puzzler, I found most of the main levels fairly straight forward but there were a couple I had to come back to.   Took me about 4.5 hours to finish everything (except an achievement for 'Complete 30 levels with less lines than the given amount'. I've only completed 19).  Higher levels require lateral thinking and a few (especially bonus levels) require pin-point placement of your lines. Personally, I play this to relax so don't mind spending the time to tweak lines, but I imagine some may find it mildly tedious.  You can skip a level if you want to, but you won't be able to unlock all bonus levels until you've gone back and solved them.  Very enjoyable, pity it isn't slightly longer. The developer is adding a level editor which should help.  ",

            "review_text": "Probably the most relaxing game I've ever played. The puzzles get really tough, but there's never any penalty for failure. You are free to experiment and move any of your lines around on the fly, watching how the slightest tweak to a line's angle or position will alter the trajectory of the bouncing lights. The visuals, music and sound effects are gorgeous, completely absorbing and endlessly soothing. And the satisfaction of stumbling on a solution that you never thought would work just never gets old. Recommended to anyone who loves puzzle games.",
