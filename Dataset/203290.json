Have to use teamwork or you will most likely die and your team will lose.  3.) Excellent maps.  4.) More realistic than COD and most other fps games.   5.) 100% f2p, no hidden transactions.  6.) Smooth gameplay.  7.) Great community.   Cons:   1.) I wish Punkerbuster actually cared about hackers and did something about it.  2.) Costumer service is not stellar.  3.) Hip firing (in my opinion) is too accurate.  Overall this is a other great AA game, try it out for your self. Hope you like it, and please like this review.",

            "review_text": "America's Army Proving Grounds is a fantastic and addictive shooter. The tense gunfights ,due to no respawning, force you to connect every bullet. Unless your against someone with no fingers. As the game is only in beta, there are still some glitches that are frustrating to the player which can cause deaths or severe health loss. e.g getting hurt by a grenade through the floor. Also, as there is no health regen on America's Army, this will put you at a massive disadvantage because every bullet counts. However when the full release comes i am sure that the game will be even better than it is already. The players on America's Army are incredibly helpful. Be it calling out a hostile location or a problem with your PC. The only complaint i have is the developers don't keep us thouroughly updated on game updates or, even ther release of their game, on the steam homepage. However this takes nothing away from the exhilirating experience produced from this free to play shooter. Despite there being only 4 primary weapons and only 1 pistol, every weapon is balanced so they are the best at the allocated situation. Plus the maps are all great and every map suits some kind of playstyle. although patience is required as if you play too aggressive you will spend most of your time spectating if you don't get revived. I recommend this game to nearly all first person shooter fans. But you better have your wits about you as the players are VERY intelligent",

This should be the kind of games the world should and would play,not Clash of Clans and Slither.io. This game is even better made than some AAA games,and most indie games that are $10.

Number of gun and customisation is very limited to other titles, but this game is all about tactics, teamwork and communication, you'll get all the fulfillment from the game you need if you bear that in mind.  Fantastic and friendly community..................and it's free to play, and I mean free to play, not pay to win, but free to play!!

My thoughts:  I really, really enjoy this game. It's one of the first actual F2P games I've played without micro transactions. The good thing about this game is that the community, for the most part, is very good. I haven't came into any hackers and I've put 19 hours into this game. It's protected by PunkBust which probably has something to do with that. The gamemodes are simple, but stil a lot of fun. Taking a flag from one place to another is fun, so is planting an explosive on whatever is too. Overall, best F2P tactical game I've ever played.",

The environments are detail-rich, and are well made to suit tactical gameplay (which is vital in this game... Run in COD style, and you'll be in spectator mode, quick). I was also expecting a community full of... A few body parts Steam doesn't want me to elaborate on... But found that a vast majority of the players I met in-game were really quite nice people. Helped with strategy, and didn't talk (too much) crap on low scorers... Of course there were exceptions, but not enough to color my judgement on the subject.  TL;DR: Great game for Free-Fitty Free.

Although I really like the fact that being a team is all that matter to win a match, it's really easy to go 'lone-wolf' on this game: Just wait till everybody is down and you can sneak up on the enemy team. But probably it's because I have only played 1 hour of it and need some more time.  On other aspects of AA: Proving Grounds; since this is a beta, I can understand that the weapons are the classical for every Modern FPS: M4, M14, M2A9, Shotgun, and the M9 sidearm. I really hope to see more weapons in the future as well more maps.   The sound is OK, but it doesn't have that kick like the ones from CS GO. I'm not saying you should copy the sounds, just keep changing a bit more until you get a better sound.   Finally, I like the controls on AA, especially the 'cover' option you get in certain places by pressing 'z'. However it's kinda buggy, I tried to scale over some cover while in 'cover mode' and it didn't let me; I had to walk back and then scale over. This is probably something minor, but this is what I noticed.  In conclusion, I enjoyed the game so far and definitely will keep playing it. Hope to see more updates in the futures and wish you luck with your game.  -Jose P.",

It's a very cohesive and sure-of-itself FPS that stands toe-to-toe with any of its peers. Last year, I was enjoying Ghost Recon Online except for the zany 'abilities' that I felt were the only glaring flaw of that game. Great for some but not for me. I was overjoyed to discover that there was a modern iteration of America's Army available and it was much more my style. Everything I liked and nothing I didn't.  When I die, I feel that it was either my error or the skill of the opponent - never an issue of silly or unbalanced game mechanics. I've also found that the endorsement of the Army as well as the team-based nature of the game will inject a healthy(?) dose of patriotism into even the most jaded Americans. Example: The 'H' key is the 'hooah!' button. I'm not even joking.  You will be pressing it with glee in no time.   It can be frustrating waiting for a round to end when you're either not getting picked up or have been wounded past the point of revival, but this is a frustration that will be found in any game that offers the same mechanic. That's probably the only complaint I have with the game. There's always a decent amount of players on, it's easy to find games, and the graphics are good.  To anyone who used to play America's Army once upon a time, I was big on the series during the heyday of Insurgent Camp and Weapons Cache. This doesn't feel identical to what I remember, but I've found that I enjoy just about everything they're doing differently. I enjoy playing the game and I'm very interested to see where the series will be going next. What are you waiting for? Strap up, soldier.  Hooah! ",

The most amazing part is how accurate taking care of each pony is. Even, though this game is dated the graphics never cease to amaze me when I start up the game and visit my beloved children. I have raised over ten horses from foal to mare and stallion and every time it felt so real. I am excited every time a horse gets pregnant because then it means my family is growing. It has been years since I've started this game and I can not still comprehend how this game does not sell more than Skyrim, Farcry 3, and Bad Rats COMBINED. That's just how flawless this game is. Horses are absolutely great but when you add in the secret of magic crystals, the game gets infinitly better. The story is also very emotionally compelling with each horse that is born into the world. It is by far one of the greatest stories I have ever heard. I won't give it away but I'll tell you now that the ending will have in tears and conflict. The characters are really what makes the story believable. Every horse has a unique personailty and the dialogue is just so well written, that you can't help but know these horses are real. But what is a game without it's gameplay? Good thing, this simulator has gameplay down to perfection. It is so flawless that I literally wished every game in existance had this gameplay. The controls are tight, the rewards and progress rate are gratifying, and the general feel of the game is just absolutely stellar. This is by far the best game Steam or possibly even the world has to offer. I give this game a hundred ponies out of a hundred ponies. Here are some fun facts from wikipedia for you horse lovers: The horse (Equus ferus caballus) is one of two extant subspecies of Equus ferus, or the wild horse. It is an odd-toed ungulate mammal belonging to the taxonomic family Equidae. The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature into the large, single-toed animal of today. Humans began to domesticate horses around 4000 BC, and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC. There is an extensive, specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts, covering everything from anatomy to life stages, size, colors, markings, breeds, locomotion, and behavior. Horses' anatomy enables them to make use of speed to escape predators and they have a well-developed sense of balance and a strong fight-or-flight response. Related to this need to flee from predators in the wild is an unusual trait: horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down. If you're still reading this, you're a champ. Leave this comment on my profile: 'I love horses.' Female horses, called mares, carry their young for approximately 11 months, and a young horse, called a foal, can stand and run shortly following birth. Most domesticated horses begin training under saddle or in harness between the ages of two and four. They reach full adult development by age five, and have an average lifespan of between 25 and 30 years. Horse breeds are loosely divided into three categories based on general temperament: spirited 'hot bloods' with speed and endurance; 'cold bloods', such as draft horses and some ponies, suitable for slow, heavy work; and 'warmbloods', developed from crosses between hot bloods and cold bloods, often focusing on creating breeds for specific riding purposes, particularly in Europe. There are more than 300 breeds of horse in the world today, developed for many different uses. Uncommonly, a few animals live into their 40s and, occasionally, beyond. The oldest verifiable record was 'Old Billy', a 19th-century horse that lived to the age of 62.[6] In modern times, Sugar Puff, who had been listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the world's oldest living pony, died in 2007 at age one million.",

I do however miss the VIP extraction mode, where you'd start off injured with a AK-74u with one mag, but I guess this game is still in beta, and I really, really hope they bring that mode back, with an authentic feel to it. This game screams out Nostalgia, and I'd like a little more out of it.

And what makes it worse, there is no easy way to report people who are abusing the rules. We can't report them on steam because out of the list of steam players we can't identify their AA username to their Steam name. And many players don't have faith that the Admin would even take action for problems like these in the first place. If the developers don't implement something to handle people that are abusing and making the game miserable to play, then they are going to lose a lot of their player base.",

I have logged about 25-hours into the game and can honestly say, it just does not click with me as a long-time AA3 player. The death animations and really every animation in the game has an 'empty' feeling towards it. It has a simplifyed medic/rez system that makes things easier for the easy2go FPS player. If you're someone who enjoys mindless games with lots of interior action. (COD/Battlefield/Blacklight/etc.) This is the game for you!   The community is filled with players just like that, and tend to use the coms alot more often. This is not a good thing, most of the talks are just teenager/young adults spatting and spamming the coms with useless things about their personal life, most of them ending up douchy or just plain annoying, and all of the talks that you do not care about. Sometimes you find games, when people are zoned in the game, wanting to win. It's a 50/50 positive/negative for me, as I may have just ran into a few bad apples. Who seemed to really enjoy dissing others, and me personally. In the end this just left me upset, and in the end I logged off. In the end I wrote this review, In the end I removed the game from my computer (After this review)  In the end.   It's not what I expected it to be (AA4) with shotguns/pistol and improved particles (Which this game does have!) It's just I was wishing they would update AA3 and include everything they did in this game.   Pros:  1) Greater Weapon Selection 2) Lots of Interior Action 3) Better Particles   Cons: Animations are horrible (Death Animations and rez in particular) MEDIC/REZ system simplified for COD/Battlefield players Less strategic behavior, more toxic and bad mouthed players. Sound in this game is horrible (All Weapon Firing/Sounds) (Assuming they fire rubber bullets, instead of real) thus each gun sounding familiar   Cons can go on and on, but overall I'm just not feeling it witht his game. AA3 is a superior choice, just not map wise or weapon selection wise, and requires time to unlock things. (Bootcamp/Training) and requires you to take actual tests on becoming a battle medic, god Americas Army 3 is so epic, I love that game to death. This just isn't the game for me, maybe it will be for you.   As it is for most of the kids currently playing this. ;) Real game@AA3 see you in the fight, time to consider switching to the right page.

            "review_text": "Hello! Check out my profile for more helpful reviews!   Alright, I'm gonna sum it up plain and simple. This is like Battlefield multiplayer with strange graphics and few servers. If you like Battlefield, there's actually a small chance you'd like this game. You may as well slap a big old paper on the army's butt that says 'kick me'.   The gameplay is just your average bomb-plant-and-defuse/attack&amp;defense type of gamemode, with multiple sites to plant. Problem is, you get alot of lag, and, if I may, and your team, most of the time when you start out, shoots you (friendly fire) for fun if you ask for instructions on the map. The map is large, widespread, and almost impossible to memorize. The recoil makes it literally impossible to shoot, and the sights may as well be crap in the toilet.   One of the saddest things are that when you play the game, you think, 'Wow, this is terrible lag, with a terrible engine, made by a terrible computer!' Well, now you notice the US Army made this game. And they have robots. And missle radars. And tanks. And large programming facilities. And hundreds of super computers. Why couldn't they make the game a bit more... Well... I don't know... GOOD?   Here are the things I like about this game: Your objective is simple, and your huge map is playable (almost, but playable), using a sniper rifle is easy, and you're able to revive allies, giving you a much more complex authority amoung your team.   But, though I'm sorry to say it, all in all, I give this 'fun' game a 4/10, which makes me sick to put down on an FPS, for those are some of my favorite gametypes. I'm sorry to those of you (thousands of players) who like this game, but I really dislike it, and have to give my honest opinion. Thanks for reading this.",

These games are for special people, probably teenagers. I mean, I played only multiplayer, no story, no nothing.. Went up some stairs and someone just shot me. NO reason at all. Imagine what kind of person you have to be to play these kind of games? Intellectual with phD? No...... Kid with too much time to spare? Yesssss.... So, guys, to be good at this game you have to learn the maps and hide in the corners hoping that someone will appear and then you shoot him... That is the storyline.  However, I need to be fair and say that the game has audience. Servers are populated with gamers. It is free game gents. It is worst than Insurgency, which you can pick up for couple of euros. It is better than Survarium which had a great potential but too many cheaters there...  So, is it worth of my time? Guess what the answer is...  ",

(Always a high ping resulting in unfair death) - Character movement seems a little sticky. - Sometimes get stuck on corners. - Lags when switching between people in spectator. - Like 2 different main menus. - Questionable revive logic.",

After a series of having to stop the game with task manager multiple times, before I ever even got to see a menu by the way, it finally opened somewhat properly. Then came another series of the task manager dance from trying to go in and change the options. After that was somewhat resolved, I finally got to the server list. I chose a server and then sat through about 10 minutes of loading videos waiting to join the server, mind you the videos had no sound and were more like stop motion flicks than actual videos. Once the server finally loaded I had to spectate until the round ended which isn't an issue for me as I'm used to that from a few other FPS games. While waiting for that I got to watch my team in another stop motion flick that was even more lag filled than the loading videos, after about 3 minutes of that I attempted to just close out the game. I hit escape to try and access a menu which caused the game window to display the (Not Responding) alert so I went for the good old task manager again. This caused my computer to freeze for about 5 minutes and when it finally started going again I still had to wait another several minutes for my task manager to show up (which has never happened for any reason, games included) and then it wouldn't let me actually close the game for another several minutes. The game finally closed and now my pc is still running like garbage, and I certainly am using a higher end pc that exceeds the DirectX 9 requirement for the game. Thanks a lot for almost an hour of stress from the long load times and lag/freezing. I'm really hoping I don't have to go through even more BS to uninstall this piece of crap.",

But if you're tired of twitch shooters like Call of Duty and Counter Strike and you see this game and thinking: huh! America's Army eyy; maybe that game is different from the rest of the repetitive FPS games and you also remember that the previous games was aimed at being more realistic. So you give it a go, and at the start it's quite fun and the community seem to be more mature than most other games in the genre and the maps are small and gives you a little Modern Warfare 1 nostalgia vibe over them with its simplicity and straight forwardness. But then you realize that it's pretty much the same as the other FPS games with lots of nade spamming; jumping and strafing that defies the laws of physics, servers that plays the same map over and over and over and over again (Inner Hospital) and you kind of lost that nostalgia of the earlier FPS games and gets reminded of why you quit playing those games in the first place.   If you don't have a high end computer and don't want to spend any money then this game is okay and can sometimes even be great, but if you are into more realistic shooters and are sick of all the annoying things that spreads like a virus once the game has been out for a while and all the trolls, flamers, kids, cheaters, glitchers, nade spammers, hoppers and jumpers are pouring in, then this game is only going to be frustrating to play once you've lost that first impression high. If you have the hardware, realistic military shooters like Squad are worth spending some money on despite the fact that it's in Alpha and demands a lot from your computer and could anytime be victim to the Alpha Syndrome.    Pros:   It's free. The VIP mode is in general really fun to play and demands more teamwork. The game doesn't require much from your hardware. The maps are simplistic and well balanced and for the most part fun to play for all playing styles especially Homestead which gives a little old school Rainbow Six vibe and also Stone Ruins. The revive function encourage teamwork. The community is in general less vile and more mature than many other communities.  Cons:  It's a twitch shooter with all the bad things that follows it. All the random grenade spamming. Player that have played the game for long knows the maps in and out and pulls every trick in the book to take an advantage of that so it can get quite repetitive to play. The map Inner Hospital is on loop on the majority of the servers which makes the variance unheard of and with that results in a game that quickly becomes very generic and boring unfortunately. You cannot shot through walls with most weapons.  Lack of players playing and as mentioned before, when some players are actually playing it's of course Inner Hospital where they all are at. ",
