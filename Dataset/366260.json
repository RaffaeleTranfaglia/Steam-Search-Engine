            "review_text": "Excellent game, but unfortunately kind of a shoddy port. There are slowdown and sound issues in this port, but that has come to be expected of dotEmu ports of NeoGeo titles.  The sound quality is also weird. Like in the other DotEmu metal slug ports, it seems to get desynchronized and then speeding uyp to compensate. That is quite annoying since Metal Slug is a series with fantastic sound design and that takes me out of it.  Fantastic gameplay, but it IS quite unfir. With good reason, too, since this was made as a token taker arcade. Still, not the best in the metal slug series (that is probably tied for me between X and 3, even though 3 does get overlong and too hard in the last levels).  All in all, not the best way to experience Meal Slug, but very worth getting even with the dotEmu port issues.",

The game seems to have been ported pretty well, at least for single player, but the menu's are a mess, local multiplayer didn't accept 2 controllers on my PC or quite simply didn't work AT ALL. These seem to be emulation issues that could easily have been caught in any half-competent QA-division, but then again the entire menu UI and the design of its backgrounds is about as low-budget as they come. At least it's not going to take you a couple dozen quarters to get through the game like with an arcade cabinet! This second game sees the return of Gal. Donald Morden and his army of faux-nazis, but also introduces the race of martians that will be a recurring enemy throughout the series. It still has the same wacky designs and the exquisite sprite details that the first one had.",
