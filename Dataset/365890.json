            "review_text": "This game is NOT what is advertised. You see large maps, with lots of units, lots of battle, and very cool units with complicated game mechanics. And yeah, this game is pretty well programmed and pretty well put together, but that is NOT what this game is.  This game is a puzzle game. The maps are small, you only have ~5 turns to complete the game, and you can only move 2-3 units per turn. So, in total you normally can make 10 - 15 moves and then the game is over. Did you complete the objective in 10 moves? yay you win. Go to the next game.  Additionally, each map is very carefully constructed (very well so) to fit perfectly with the deployed pieces. There is ALWAYS a hedgerow perfectly positioned to cut off line-of-sight or to hide in. There is ALWAYS a stretch of open area that is just barely too long to run accross in 1 turn. While there is nothing wrong with this, it further pushes you toward the puzzle aspect. There is a right way to solve each game.  Combined with this is the dreaded dice rolls. Have an 83% chance to hit.. nah you miss. I swear that comes up way too often. Enemy tank comes rolling up and runs over your men (which does no damage), then shoots at you point-blank range. No worries. They miss... wait, what?  Typically each stage is played like this: Start a game. Play around while watching what the enemy does. Restart. Position your troops to counter the computer's move (because it almost always does the same thing). Repeat for 3 rounds. If you get unlucky with the dice, just repeat the exact same moves until you win. And since each stage is so short, it doesn't take too long to do.  Also, not only is each stage short, the entire campaign (including all 3 factions) is short. With luck, you could complete the entire game in a few hours. But, since the dice are what they are, this gets artifically elongated to about 6ish hours. Maybe multiplayer is much better, I didn't try it out. But $30 for 6 hours of gameplay? You should pass.  This game needs to be more expansive. MUCH more so. Larger maps, more units, unlimited turns.   Also make sure you get it on sale. The devs did some good work, but it definitely is not worth the price they're asking.",

            "review_text": "A pretty good adaptation of hte board game. It is still missing card play and the editor but those have been confirmed as on the way within the month.  Gameplay is pretty tight and there are enough units and builds to keep things interesting until the expanded content starts to appear.  Definitely recommended to fans of the boardgame or anyone looking for a light WW2 skirmish level game.",

            "review_text": "A must have or try for tactical turn based enthusiasts, especially for WWII nerds..   cool animation ( you feel deeply satisfied when your panzeshreck squad blew the sherman that's been terrorizing your side of bocages &amp; hedgerows, or when your zundapp motorbike make hit&amp;run manouvre that broke the enemy infantry line )  well thought tactical scenario ( yes a bit puzzle but the best tactical game out there is puzzle-like e.g: panzer corps, while the worst will let you do as you like and you just keep steamroll through the scenario e.g: FF tactic )  weird, colorful, heroic (sorta) characters that got inspiration from WWII movies like kelly's heroes &amp; band of brothers and real life military people   randomness of dice roll sometime will make you furious, but the devs recently patched a failsafe if lady luck aint on your side, it will prevent a string of bad dice roll, and there's a ironman mode if you want the old true random dice roll ( good tactic and positioning will beat the odds, and hey bazooka rounds and sherman's shellshot isnt always penetrate the panzer armor right? some will just ricochet off the plate just like in the movies ;) )",

I'm not an ASL'er but still, the amazing go-anywhere halftracks is a step too silly for me. The inability of infantry to move and fire at all also prevents a lot of otherwise interesting tactics.  Still, it's well done and fast to play, I don't regret the purchase and I expect it to get better over the coming weeks. Just don't expect much in the way of deep strategy.",

            "review_text": "Everything the people above me said, i agree with.   my only frustration with this game is that the dice are unfair, like usual. It keeps me from playin aggressively, knowing that the PC will just roll higher than me most of the time.   i actually recorded 50 dice rolls of mine and 50 for the pc and 67% of the time the pc rolled higher.  Other than that, this game is great and i will be purchasing it physically.",

            "review_text": "I've usually been more into tactical games like Combat Mission, etc. So I was a little dubious about how much I would get into this game. I have only played it 7 hours so far. I have finished the tutorial and am half way thru the US campaign. I have already made my own scenario called, 'A River runs thru it.' The editor was probably the easiest one I've ever seen yet quite capable. Have not played the multiplayer yet. But so far I have to say I am enjoying this game. I spent some time today in the manual to pick up and better understand some of the games' nuances like cards and unit tokens. I bought the game itself along with both DLCs for less than $35 which isnt too bad. I think I will get my money's worth. You can always wait for a sale as both Steam and matrix games have them from time to time. Or, after watching some youtube streams and videos, you can go for it like I did. I am still however, trying to understand the gold/purchase part of the game and dont particulatily care for that aspect so far. But thats my only complaint so far. Would like to see some more terrain tiles besides just Normandy and definately some more DLCs like desert war and east front..",

The multi-player games that i had went very well but these days most of the games in the list are passworded. maybe there is a league i dont know about or something. i dont know what held this game back from being hugely popular and widely played . For me it provides a great table-top experience with fun mechanics.",
