            "review_text": "As old as MDK 2 is it still looks sweet given it age but I enjoyed that game enough to take a step even farther back... to the orignal MDK. Given how old this game is, I expect the graphics to take an ugly step back and man I wish I was wrong on that note. I was surprised Steam even had this game given it's age, problem was it was a bad port for some of us. Problem with me was I was getting Kurt and the basic background background and nothing else with the game. Fortunately under Steam's tech support there is a patch that fixes that problem. If you play this game, the controls are going to be crude from what you are used to. When your mouse isn't in free look mode, that's quite an adjustment when you've done years in first person shooters. Even so I think this game is worth a look back and I can already tell It has the same loopy humor MDK 2 has. Maybe not with voice acting anymore but the name's of the weapons you pick up says it all. I've just gotten this game to run properly and can tell I'm going to have fun with it, even though I'm still arkward with the controls. Is this game even worth a look see? Most of you would say no given it's age and most of us whom played this as kids are fathers now so no I don't expect this generation of kid like it, much less show interest. But that's not surprising... this game is really old and didn't hold up well at all. Can I really recommend this game honestly? No... sad to say unless you already had an interest in this game. This game is well past it's prime but it's still worth a glance back in my option.",

            "review_text": "While indeed yes, I played MDK in the past and I enjoyed it I have a few things to say about the game on newer PC's.  Users with Windows 10 may experience issues with levels not displaying and even to the point of the characters not displaying as well the game experienced a major slow down while going into the display options.  Someone may have to test it on Windows 7,8 and 8.1 to see if it works on there.  Sound still works and the Camera behaves just as the character is there and is moving around.  I can't say for sure if this is a issue with older display drivers or absent ones due to them being from the time that MDK was made and no longer supported and or avaliable.",
