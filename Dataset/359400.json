            "review_text": "I gave 'Why Am I Dead At Sea' every opportunity to disappoint me. The character sprites felt derivative of a certain console RPG franchise depicted in my profile pic; the chiptune soundtrack suggested a by-the-numbers approach to game design. I am relieved to report that these initial doubts fell by the wayside after only a little play, and surface concerns of this sort disappeared once I submerged myself in the mystery.  The central conceit is that you're the spirit of someone recently killed, and you can inhabit the bodies of people you know to access their abilities and research the circumstances of your death. If you learn enough about your host, you can take full control, doing things that they wouldn't normally or discussing subjects of which they know nothing. This didn't seem very original in my initial (uncharitable) assessment—Double Fine's 'Stacking' treads similar ground. However: 'Stacking' is a high-concept artpiece puzzler that I couldn't bring myself to finish. 'Why Am I Dead At Sea' is a  thriller . It has  suspense . It has characters that  appear  to inhabit straightforward archetypes—and then it challenges  you  to figure out whether those characters have contradictory depths, or complementary depths, or no depth whatsoever.  I played through it twice in eight hours.  Highly recommended.",

            "review_text": "***Slight trigger warning in spoiler tags below.***  I absolutely loved this game. It was way better than I anticipated. It was confusing at times, with me wandering around trying to figure out if I'd actually talked to everyone I needed to in order to progress. I did use guides for a couple of the steps and three of the endings (because I'm not naturally very good at puzzles), but overall it wasn't too difficult or too easy. The story was brilliant, as were the subplots, and kept me guessing for ages. It's astonishing how much is really in this game and for such a good price. It reminded me a little of Undertale without the fighting, by which I mean the many mysteries to uncover. I had an enjoyable couple of nights playing, and I wholeheartedly recommend Why Am I Dead At Sea. ♥     **SPOILER** Trigger warning for pills for one of the character's backstories/special abilities. Since I know several people who would definitely not be able to deal with that, I'm going to tell you what happens. You can make the decision whether to read it or not.     When you are finding out more about the characters, you might find out Darryl's backstory. He was happily married for three years, until one day he came home from work late to find his wife had committed suicide by medication overdose. She had anxiety issues, the extent of which he was not fully aware of, and so it came as a total shock. If you read his mind and listen to his apathetic speech you'll see he is quite clearly depressed. He carries empty pill bottles in one of his pockets, and his ability is to take a pill which increases his speed but also blurs his vision (and yours, by default). If you have problems with things like discussions of overdoses (especially by pills) then maybe this game isn't for you. However it only plays a small part in the narrative, so it's possible it won't cause any issues if you are prepared for it.  ",

            "review_text": "This isn't so much a game as it is a story that you slowly dig up as you talk to each character with each character. It was frustrating when I didn't know what to do, but for every moment when I had a lead, I was hooked. The story is joy to unravel, since the game rewards you for searching for clues. There's a lot here that you could miss, and still finish the game. I'm sure there's a lot I missed, and I'm pretty sure I got the 'good' ending. For ten bucks, it's definitely worth playing, though you may want to wait till there are decent guides for when you get stuck.",

            "review_text": "I bought this game because the premise looked interesting--you get to be a ghost that possesses people in order to solve the crime of your own death. What I didn't realize was that in the process of solving your own murder (or not solving it depending on the ending), you would get to learn the sad tales of all the other characters. Almost everyone on the cruise had their faults and pains that haunted them, and nudging the characters here and there to find carthasis made the sappy soul inside of me so happy. If you like story-centric games with minimal gameplay aside from swapping characters and investigating every nook and cranny, then I fully recommend you play this game. For $5, I got 5 hrs of fun and would have had more had I not read a walkthrough for every instance I got stuck.",

I got stuck into walls or completely glitched out, forcing me to replay big sections of the game.  You can partially and completely posses people. Since that opens up different dialogue options, it can be annoying because you sometimes need to 'partially' posses a person to get the right dialogue option. I'd rather be able to select the good one while also 'completely' possessing a person.  The different endings are a bit flakey to get, forcing you to replay sections a lot.  Great dialogue, interesting characters, lovely graphics.  YOU CAN READ PEOPLE'S MINDS AS A GHOST",

            "review_text": "I enjoy a good mystery, and I thought the visuals were neat, so I expected to have a fun time playing this game. What I did not expect, though, was just how interesting the cast of characters could be, which was certainly helped by the gameplay mechanic of needing to learn about people to influence their actions. The atmosphere in general was appealing, thanks in part to an excellent soundtrack. And when it comes to length, while it was shorter than some mysteries, it was long enough to truly feel attached to the events occurring. All in all, even if you don't consider yourself an amateur sleuth, I'd still suggest checking this game out. Maybe you'll discover that you're a better detective than you'd thought by the end of it!",

I had to replay this game, back to the beginning, 4 times to unlock a certain character that'll allow me to reach an ending (and I still haven't reached an ending yet). One of the times was because the game bugged out and deleted all of my progress.. You'd have to sit through hours of familiar content as you replay this game over and over till you get everything right. It also gets repetitive REALLY fast. I only liked this game and gave a thumbs up, because the soundtrack is perfect, story is intriguing, and characters have extremely deep backgrounds. You will definitely hit the feels at least once in this game.",

I expected a kind of gamey whodunit mystery, but it very quickly turned into an enthralling story of interesting characters and a surprising amount of suspense for such a simple looking game. My only real complaint is that in the final act, when loose ends are meant to come together in a build-up to the climax, the pacing almost drops dead with some of the puzzle solving and how contrived it has become in order to address all points, but it manages to recover well in the final scenes.",

It's an engaging simple story where you have to use your own initiative, logic and connections to piece together who you are, why you died and who did it. I liked this game because it rewards you for paying attention and seems to play out logically. Even at points where I didn't know who to talk to or what to do next I still felt engaged enough to carry on playing because I wanted to know who did it. If you like mysteries and don't mind having to actually piece together a lot of the info without it being expressly pointed out then I really recommend this. On the downside I did encounter two glitches which meant I had to reload and back track, one where my character flew out of the room into the black space and couldn't get back and another early in the game where I accidentally left the cat in Gwen's room blocking her in but it wouldn't let me possess the cat to move it. Of course saving regularly helps to avoid these problems. On the whole though I really enjoyed this and hope they make more :D",

If this developer makes another mystery game I'll probably buy it.",
