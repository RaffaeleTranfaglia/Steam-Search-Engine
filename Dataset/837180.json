    "description": "Slamoids! is an intense, re-playable, single player arcade score-chaser. Dodge and shoot slamoids as they hurtle across the screen, while also avoiding the ever growing and shrinking red ring that surrounds you. Slamoids! is a perfect coffee break game for when you only have a few minutes to spare.",
