    "description": "A cross-platform twin-stick shooter and bullet hellish game. It's designed as a pickup game you can play in 5-10 minutes when you just wanna shoot a lot of bullets and dodge just as many. Survive as many waves as possible and pickup a few power-ups along the way (.. ahem... you'll need them).",
