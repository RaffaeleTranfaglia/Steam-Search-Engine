            "review_text": "I don't get to experience the nostalgia others will get but on it's own, even as of 2015, this game is so much fun.  The graphics are cute, it's fairly difficult and the micromanagment involved is just the right amount to not overshadow the combat that takes place every now and then.   The unit sizes that you start with could change depending on the unit size setting you have selected, but i'll just mark it down as immersion.   Any total war fan fed up with the current bug riddled and incomplete games will find solace in this gem.",

Although the graphics are....well....give me a piece of paper and I can make those birds that flap around durring battles. Still though, a very well-thoughtout gem of a game that can beat some of the other titles as far as gameplay is concerned.  Some of my favorite features: The crusades and Jihads are massive You freely give titles of lordship at will Marry within the family  --&gt; ACTUALL freakin' civil wars &lt;-- Somewhat more competent AI than the others (but I think it has to do with the simplicity of the game mechanics like the map being made of regions instead of a free-roaming world) An amazing soundtrack.  I hear there are mods but I have no idea if those still work. Best place to check would be at  TWcenter.net  (HUGE modding community)  Best $9.99 I've spend this month...",

            "review_text": "first for all those people that have problems, i've been playing full games with no crashing. i set the game to windows compat. mode XP service pack 3. i change the rez of the game map and battle map to fit my desktop rez. i run the program as an administrator and you can't launch the game from steam. you have to go to the Medieval_TW.exe in your steam files and launch it. also quick saves can corrupt save game files so only (Esc button) saves work. also the battles may also cause crashing. try not to play the battle just auto resolve. i run windows 7 and don't have any problems after two games.  -The story this is the first total war i have ever played. this game brings me back to when i had a pci (not pci E) graphics card slot and couldn't play this game on my dell (agp card slots were the fastest at that time). i would read the manual in math class looking at the cool units and campaign map. how the 3D'ish battles worked and looked. then i would go home and look at the intro to the game just for it to crash as i hit start a new game. i wanted to play it so bad and after begging my mother at comp USA to get me a better card my dell could finally play the game (i was 14 i think). my first time going into the campaign map was just as the manual had explained. a chess like setup with 3D'ish battles and with whole armys I MADE. never before had a game stood out to me as being a real commanding game. i would say if you can stand the graphics then get this game to feel like a true military commander and statesman.",

            "review_text": "Pure, Distilled Total War ---------- If you like total war, but never played these older 2D games then Medieval and Shogun are a must try. Keep in mind Total War was a VERY different game before Rome: much simpler; almost board game-like rules where your objective is singular: conquer the map before time runs out. Build buildings in your provinces to get money and units, give titles to your generals to boost their stats, recruit agents to to your dirty work, fight battles to conquer everyone else, that's it. Very easy to pick up and go, and next thing you know you've been up all night playing.",

I spent thousands of hours playing this as a kid. This game dates before CA began to ♥♥♥♥ everything up.   Even better, this version runs on later systems no problems. :)   £6.99 is a steal to be honest; you get a vast amount of content. Weird to think how this early gem has in some cases better content then the likes of Rome 2 and Attila. CA, get your act together.",

The game is now outdated and looks it, but the game play and combat is more fun than any of the sequals. I know a lot of people myself included experience a lot of crashes to desktop, but after a quick google search there is a solution for most people, turn down the resolution from max (or something like that) and the crashes stop....at least they did for me and a lot of other people.  So if you feel nostalgic and want to play a total war game for a reasonable price, without having to micro manage too much then give it another go, it may bring back happy memories, but at the very least it won't annoy you like all the sequals do.",

The infinite possibilities of moulding history to your liking, the unique bond you develop with your generals and their equally unique stories and traits, the purely Medieval feeling of your chess-like TBS map... For me, it is also the memories: Medieval was my first Total War, my first strategy game on PC, and the beginning of an age. I can't recount all the hours spent in front of it when I was a child with a weird taste in games, who enjoyed conquering the world a lot more than making weird animals jump over wooden crates (yes, mr. Bandicoot, I'm talking to you).  PS Don't be confused by my scarce gameplay time - I used to own a retail version and I totally played the heck out of it for years and years!",

It took me couple of hours to figure out that it has not actually been fixed, as crashes are still commonplace, and gamebreaking when they involve AI moves that can't be avoided.  I cannot get a refund because it seemed to work perfectly for the first few hours, so leaving a review is the best I can do. I hope the devs fix the game, but it has been months since release and I haven't heard anything from them. Please save yourself the money until they fix it.  Edit:  All of this was true until Blandy suggested I change the resolution. Since then, I have been running with campaign map resolution of 1024 X 768, and I have yet to experience a single crash. To clarify, I am using Windows 7 64 bit. I am able to fight massive battles without any difficulty whatsoever.",

I've literally tried every trick in the book, or every 'solution' I found online, and NOTHING seems to work!!   First I did a clean install of Win10. I updated ALL my drivers. I installed Steam. Then I installed STW:WE, Shogun TW 2, and then I installed MTW:G. Both Shogun 1 AND 2 work just fine after some tweaking. (Compat-mode Win7 etc.)   But MTW:G?? Nothing! I get the intro, then black screen, no sound, nothing..   So I've tried using every single compatibility available, with every setting possible (16-bit colors, 8-bit colors, starting as admin with desktop-shortcut, etc.) and changing my screen resolution to every option available. And that's A LOT! (800*600, 1024*786, etc.)   Nothing seems to work. I've even tried doing this whole process again and ONLY installing Mediaval TW Gold..   Anyone else has this problem or has any tips for me? I'm usually pretty good with stuff like this, being a gamer for over 21 years, but this has kept me baffled for ages now -____-  DO NOT BUY IF YOU HAVE THE LATEST VERSION OF WIN10!!
