            "review_text": "9 Reviews 8 Good\\1 Bad. Mixed? Nope.   This game is caesar III but better. The only thing I don't really like about it is the way the camera works. Everything else is very familiar to people who played Caesar III.   It's prettier and it has more buildings\\resources. At 9.99€ it's a good price\\quality ratio.  If you are a city builder guy and you like the Roman period consider giving this game a try. It's an old game but it's fun to play through the campaign. So... Why not?  As in other reviews here: 'Note: If game does not start or errors on start you might need to go into games folder (%Steam folder%\\steamapps\\common\\Caesar 4\\C4\\) and run RegisterDLL.bat with administrator rights.'  I did this and it runs just fine.",
