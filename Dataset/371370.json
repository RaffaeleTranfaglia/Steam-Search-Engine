    "description": "Havilah and Asharia are at war. It's not the first time and it probably won't be the last. But, what the people of these countries don't know is that these wars have already been foretold. The 4 ancient tablets left behind by the &quot;Creator&quot; prophesy of other things as well but, no one knows what they say.",

I like to explore every nook and cranny, and tend to wander a lot, but that is not advisable in this game. Monsters respawn as soon as you leave the map, so returning to the screen you left 2 seconds ago means more fighting, more potion use, etc. Very disheartening. But if you tend to move always forward, then you will probably enjoy it..",
