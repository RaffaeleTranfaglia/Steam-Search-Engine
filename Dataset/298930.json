            "review_text": " “The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown” ― H.P. Lovecraft,  Supernatural Horror in Literature    Here I was, a bit bored and a bit biased about the marriage of a point &amp; click adventure with the theme of horror, but  Darkness Within 1: In Pursuit of Loath Nolder  was a spectacular experience! I've spared 14 hours or so, discovered every achievement, read and re-read every single document, practically poked my nose in every single pixel in the game; but I am still paranoid about missing a piece of the great picture, as any Lovecraftian theme should make you so...  In this gem of a Lovecraftian setting, you play as Howard E. Loreid; a detective that investigates the strange murder of Clark Field, a wealthy man involved in the dark art of occult. The prime suspect of the crime is a man named Loath Nolder, a famous private investigator and an admitant of the local insane asylum. Our game starts with a nightmare, and a phone call coming from our partner, Arthur, in the middle of the night. We're informed that Loath Nolder has escaped...  The game takes brilliant twists and turns, and forces you to investigate odd objects coming from forgotten times, secluded buildings that no one visits and isolated areas of the local geography with dark histories. The atmosphere is carefully arranged to procure a balance between the uneasiness that we feel from a partially observed shadow that lingers in the night, and the raw sense of dread that we suffer whence we face the plain unexplainable. Environment is a huge success to create that lingering, uncanny feeling that haunts us when we are reading a random narration excerpt taken from H.P. Lovecraft's  At the Mountains of Madness . It actually uses direct characters and anecdotes from Lovecraft stories like  The Case of Charles Dexter Ward ,  The Whisperer in Darkness  and  The Rats in the Walls .  Gameplay carries two major features that makes the investigation process noteworthy. As you observe events and the environment, you take mental notes in your journal as ideas, observations and suspicions, alongside conversations. You are to pick and add the relevant ideas together to make a thought process to grasp the insight of happenings. This progress of deduction presents the player a unique gameplay. Nothing is presented to you on a silver platter: you actually have to think like an investigator to decide which evidence might go with another to indicate a fact. Another feature is about the documents you stumble in the game. In these kind of games, the gameplay usually presents you your next objective just after you read the document, automatically. Here, you underline the part of the document that you think to be relevant or important and think about it! I mentioned hard work, didn't I?  If you do sincerely enjoy the horror genre - not your common jump scare, or plain human cruelty: an actual sense of gothic that will keep pushing your buttons to keep you awake at night, you MUST try this game. It is brilliant as an adventure, astonishing as a horror game. Plus, it is Lovecraftian!

There is no action or something like that, the pace is slow with alot of text which maybe will scare away some players, but thats the whole point I think. It's what makes it so scary and eerie. The Lovecraftian feeling is spot on!",

The fear of unknown (darkness, creaking sounds, whispers, etc.) is built so masterfully that few times I had pounding heartbeat, clicking like crazy to 'run away' and 'turning around' to locate the source of weird, scary noises :) Puzzles and clues are difficult (played as a 'senior detective', so no hints), but logical (I have cheated once in the end with disc puzzle, and when I saw the solution - facepalm!)  Really enterntaining and challenging game!   From the person that is scared of dark cellars and attics. ",

            "review_text": "I almost always have a couple of point-and-click adventures of some description installed and in varying states of completion. I find them to be fairly casual games to play for the most part, that I can play while the Mrs. is watching some rubbish on TV, and that I can simply pause or escape out of when the serious business of being a thirty-something year old child is invariably interrupted. But there are always exceptions, and ten minutes of gameplay is usually enough to tell when you’re playing one, and these are the ones that are worth savouring; These are the ones that you want to have the house to yourself to play, and even then you’ll wear headphones just in case some rude individual knocks on the door with the misguided assumption that you care about what they have to say. No, good Sir, today is the day that I am playing, The Darkness Within: In Pursuit of Loath Nolder. I care not for your free light bulbs, kindly leave without knocking.  I don’t claim to be any type of expert on Lovecraft, but I have read quite a bit of his work, and anyone who is familiar with even only the most commonly referenced stories would know that his protagonists consistently speak of how they must hide the knowledge they have uncovered at all costs, even unto death. It should come as no surprise then, that when a game comes along that can truly own the tag of “Lovecraftian”, that it’s going to be f*$%ing hard to piece together what secret cults, madmen, and good old-fashioned wizards and necromancers, are trying so hard to keep secret. The Darkness Within is an excellent game for quite a few reasons, the most straightforward of these however, is that it’s honest.  As Detective Howard E. Loreid, the player uses a unique and somewhat complex inventory/problem solving interface, to sift through the information and puzzles that are uncovered throughout the course of an investigation into a man’s death. This interface is used to make the mental connections between certain clues and items found throughout the game, and you’re made to work for it a lot of the time, just like a real detective. There are no shortcuts. You will paw over documents multiple times to unlock the secrets they contain, and there will be no picking up of random items in the hope that they will come in handy later. Oh no, if you want to pick up that pot in the kitchen and carry it around, you had better have already figured out why. And how good is that!? It makes sense. It also forces you to pay attention and remember where things are, and where you might need to revisit to get what you need later.  The locations are well crafted with plenty of suggestively dark corners and creative use of lighting, and do an excellent job of setting the mood for the unfolding story. These locations are also very faithfully “Lovecraftian”. Gambrel roofs, brooding forests, tunnels, and richly-appointed studies all make an appearance, and the supplementary material that is found within these environments is also very faithful to a true Lovecraft horror. I can’t get enough of all the diagrams and sketches, and all the little extras that go into making a game that has depth. I love it. There’s plenty in The Darkness Within: In Pursuit of Loath Nolder to satisfy fans of stories like, “The Case of Charles Dexter Ward”, and, “The Statement of Randolph Carter”.  Zeotrope Interactive have proved that they understand the importance of sound, and lack thereof, to create suspense in a game. Creaking floorboards, whistling draughts, and oppressive bouts of silence are all used to great effect, and the hauntingly-crafted musical tracks provide excellent ambience to their respective environments. The character models do have that classic PS1 kind of look about them, but honestly, for me they add a subtle level of creepiness to the game that I actually find very endearing. I like my horror games to be weird and kind of f#%*ed up in that way, so this period-style character animation fits perfectly for my taste.  If you like Lovecraft, and I’m not talking about bull$#it tentacles and cartoon plush toys; I’m talking about well researched, and caringly executed homages to classic literature, then you will like this game. Just be mindful of the fact that this is not a game for those with lazy brains who just want to grind out yet another point-and-click. This game is about a detective working to solve a mystery, and sometimes you’re going to have to take a second look at things to fully understand what is going on. Likewise, it’s not a game for people looking for easy jump scares or Penumbra-esque games of hide and seek; This is a game for people who understand what was considered “horror” at the turn of the last century. At the time of this review you can pick this game up for $1.99 US during the 2016 Summer Sale, and that’s an absolute bargain for the quality of game you will get in return.",

            "review_text": "The Darkness Within is quite a tale told mainly through past events. I loved how it ended. However, some of the game mechanics made it rather difficult. The most difficult mechanic is using the think boxes where you have to put clues together in order to come to a conclusion. While interesting on paper, this mechanic added another level of difficulty to an already somewhat difficult game. This game does not handhold you through the story and I found it to be somewhat difficult to determine where I was supposed to go at times, eventually referring to a walkthrough because I was so frustrated. Only to find that I was simply to continue to go back and re-review a letter or book that I had already seen.   If I had to decide to play the game again, I would purely because the story was so entertaining and thought provoking. However, would I play it again after knowing what the story is? Probably not unless I was really bored and had nothing better to play.   I would recommend this game for a seasoned adventure/point and click gamer who is interested in analyzing the text and a mechanic that you need to use to decide what to do next and advance the story.",

            "review_text": "Not the longest, or best looking game out there, but definitely worth a look for the story and atmosphere.   My main criticism would be that some of the gameplay lacks initiative. Some of the puzzles are just so vague that you're left wondering where you're meant to go next. Also, some of the investigating can be a bit misleading. For example you can click on and inspect things which would help you in the story, but can you actually take and use them? No. Or rather you can, but you have to wait until later when the game finally prompts you to use said item.  Despite that, the story is very compelling, creepy, but not really scary. The atmosphere has a sense of foreboding and oppressiveness about it, like any good Lovecraftian tale should. The game's atmosphere does a lot with very little, something it should be recognised for.  I'd recommend this to anyone who wants a creepy point and click game, or anyone who appreciates a genuinely unsettling story that Lovecraft himself would be proud of. Also, at the price this is currently going for I don't think you can go wrong.",
