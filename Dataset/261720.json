More stereotyping of demographics than Tumblr, less pop culture references than Magicka, and sexual innuendo on-par with a Louis C.K. skit. Still had fun, for what it's worth. Cheap voice actors probably would have helped immensely.  Only bother if you desperately want a shallow, simple RPG to kill a few hours (and even then I'm sure there are many other, better options out there.)",

First, the lack of english voices, but it was ok, I can understand german so was not so bad. Turn based combat was also decent, even if too easy even at hard difficulty. I've found the dialogues were too short, characters personality not developped and the game damn too short. Completed in 6 hours with all achievements. The humor was ok, but I laughed a lot more with GT1 and GT2. Overall I can't say I was disappointed, but this third episode was a 'lite' version of the previous ones. I suggest to buy it on sale, 10Eur is too much for what will you get. 3/5",

Aside from that the game is funny and pleasant, as always the animations are cool ! And I love the combat system, the camera still a bit weird, but nothing game breaking.",
