The soundtrack is one of the best I've ever heard for any game. Big thumbs up to Oscar Araujo for it. There is incredible detail put into every level!   The game is decently long too. It doesn't feel like it gets old either. The levels are refreshing and there are a ton of boss fights. There isn't really any ingenuity in the gameplay- I've seen it all elsewhere, but that's fine with me. As long as it doesn't fail- which it does not.  I honestly think this game should've gotten Game of the Year back in 2011, instead of Skyrim. I was extremely excited to re-purchase this for PC and cannot wait for the sequel!  Rating: 5/5",

            "review_text": "Do not mistake your CHARACTER for being this games' protagonist - that role clearly belongs to your METAL CHAIN WHIP!  Remember that good ol' Castlevania feeling from WHIPPING (and Throwing Dagger'ing and Holy Water'ing) your way through werewolves and vampire monsters by pale moonlight? This game builds on that and you will chuckle many a time as you try out new combos and fun powers to experiment with.  I had a great time playing through the whole thing. Sure, it's a long game, maybe too long for some, but for me it was just about right.  Except for one annoying instance that took me many tries to beat, the game felt very balanced when shifting between medium (warrior) and easy (squire). And believe me when I say you should play it on either of those two difficulties, if you'd like to preserve your sanity. You may play for challenges if you wish, but they are not mandatory, so even the non-masochistic players can enjoy their METAL CHAIN WHIPPING game. QTE's are never great, but I didn't find them too annoying here. Cut scenes break up some of the game, but it's still very enjoyable.  Oh, and the art is mostly DROP DEAD GORGEOUS - I want these artists to decorate my house if they ever get tired of pouring their HEART and SOULS into games like this.  You can do some combat parts by button-mashing, but you should learn to counter, block and time your hits after some time. BUT FEAR NOT, because this is both fun and super-satisfying - the blood party starts for real when you pull something awesome off with your METAL CHAIN WHI...(okay, you got it), and the game goes into slow-motion as you smack your enemies around, consuming leftover dark and light energy orbs from their corpses, to fuel your powers for another round of METAL CHAIN WHIP (sorry, it's just the best weapon ever) carnage.  My playing it for all those hours should tell you one thing - to buy this game as soon as you get the chance.",

            "review_text": "Castlevania name, a forsaken world in darkness, creatures of vampires, werewolves and countless undeads, gothic castles and horrific landscapes.  What could possibly go wrong for such a game?  Well, everyting except for a few, for this game. This game is a shining example of how not to do an action adventure game.  First, I will give the pros. Voices and some good, gothic landscapes, occasionally the music.   I am not good at this kind of beat'em up games, I've to admit. Though I completed many similar games, like God of War series, I even completed the Bayonetta! Gameplay mechanics of this game is a piece of crap compared to those games.   Dark side and light side magic activation is a huge failure. You beat up the creatures, you get some orbs and you choose which magic to fuel up. Fueling up the magic is incredibly slow while consuming is incredibly fast. Besides why do I have two kinds of magic? Why not combine them? Why it takes soooo long to fuel them up? Bad design. Very bad design.  Skill combos are poorly selected and they have the worst key combination I have ever seen in such a game. God damn it, even a million times complex Bayonetta has more plain key combinations for combos!   Double tap the analog to run fast. Have you lost your mind? What kind of gameplay design is this? Developers have serious issues here...  Combat. You play an action adventure, which is actually a beat'em up game. Combat gotta be brutal, right? See God of War? You shake the bones of your enemies, rip them apart. But in this game, you feel like you are tickling enemies with your chaines. Your blows do INCREDIBLE low damage. WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?!? You grab an enemy, you WAIT for a f-word button sequence to complete the action sequence. Why not auto-execute immediately like other games? Why force the player to wait in the middle of the combat? Combining the poorly implemented combos, combat is miserable for a game in this genre.  Ridiculous puzzles. Well, not all of them are ridiculous. But some of them are so bad, you think like 'What the hell am I doing by playing this game?'. See the scarecrow puzzle and music box puzzle, which are played sequentially. RIDICULOUS is not enough to describe them.   F. this game.  We got Soul Reaver series back in the time. Those were the games. Proper action adventures. Not this technologically advanced piece of crap.   I highly NOT recommend this game. You should stay away from this abomination. If you like action adventure games, Darksiders 1 and Darksiders 2 are on the Steam. Those are fantastic games, and it will be a shame if I compare them to this game. Whatever this game represents in the negative way for modern action advention genre, Darksiders represent the positive way.  2/10         ",

The story is basically incomprehensible, but in an ok way (think Bayonetta). Come to think of it the combat is very reminicant of Bayonetta also, with a bit of DMC (new one) thrown in. The Game itself moves along at a nice clip (after that first five hours oof) through the small explorable arenas that make up each chapter. You are obviously expected to do several runthroughs as each level has areas that cant be accessed untill you unlock your new evil spiked cross or whatever. Happily though this menu is easy to navagate and as the story is a pile of jibberish you wont feel youre missing anything by retreading old ground.   I hear it gets better after the hump that took me a few days, Ill report back, at this point I would say hold off for 4.99 unless you enjoy that Bayonetta flashy action type of experience.    Dont go into this one thinking God of War. Its not. Its totally different, you will only have the wrong bar set too high and make those first five hours miserable.",

            "review_text": "So as this game goes on sale I hope to give you an informative review of this game. While it was gifted to me during the Christmas steam sale, I have played through it several times and I still cannot justify owning or purchasing this game. As a diehard fanatic of the series from the very beginning this game lacks everything that made the series fantastic. This is not to say the game is bad, however, it is completely  mediocre  . The potential for greatness IS there, however, it fails to truly deliver. For every stunning visual scene in the game it has twice as many glaring, disgusting bland LEVELS that serve no absolutely no purpose. In fact, the game feels lopsided when it comes to level count. The second chapter has by far the most levels in the game and yet the two chapters afterward only have two apiece to them. I fail to see the logic behind this besides trying to fit a familiar theme, however, this only makes chapter 2 a daunting, boring, trial to complete. There is no   FLOW  to this game. It stops and goes at its own pace, and it feels disgustingly rushed. The gameplay is a mashed together blend of several popular action games ranging from God of War to Shadow of Colossus that fails to deliver any of the finer points of any of those games. Combat is simple, yet, frustrating from the lack of meat behind it. The 'whip' (I'm more akin to call it the blades of chaos but I'll bite) is better described as a wet noodle. Enemies have very little to not hit registration so it makes it feel like all of your blows either do nothing or bounce off of them with little to no visible effect. Enemies are not chained, nor can you combo properly in most cases making it more of a game of unleashing a flurry of attacks, and then either parrying them to stun them for one second or dodging past them if you cannot. This is all there is to combat, there is very little variety between enemy types and their attack. Each enemy may seem differently, but the majority of them have three same attacks. The types of attacks are as follows: a quick jab, a slower stronger attack, and a shockwave. I have successfully described 99% of the attacks you'll be dealing with in this game. To try and amplify Gabriel's abilities he comes across a small selection of subweapons and magic to try increase variety in combat. These fail to do anything but be useless or completely trivialize encounters all together. Take for example the earliest subweapon you get, the silver daggers. You are given ten of them near the start of the game and are given enough refills to completely destroy any werewolf type enemy in a single hit, aside from heavier lycans. This is the equivalent of having an 'I win' button which should never be the case in any brawler. Yet alone you are purposefully given an ability soon after that lets you oneshot any small enemy with a simple QTE regardless by tapping the right trigger/R2 button. You cannot be harmed during this, and you can chain this quite easily, leaving only the big, burly enemies, whose attacks I've already described, to easily be dealt with. In fact, the only time combat is truly challenging in Lords of Shadow is during engagements with multiple big enemies, which are few and far between, or when the camera forces itself lodged into a wall. I've have many a moment where the camera simply refused to show me the enemies, leaving me to guess blindly in the dark where they could be attacking from. This is simply unacceptable in any game in my opinion. The absence of good in my mind is not bad, it is average. Lords of Shadow is the definition of an average game. It functions, most of the time, within acceptable limits, but, does not excel at anything. I cannot recommend Lords of Shadow to someone who enjoys the series, since it is simply not a Castlevania game outside of name alone. It's a mediocre, bland, boring brawler that does its best to rip off other successful franchises but fails to capture any of its own rich history that spans twenty years in the making. This is what infuriates me the most as a fan of the series. This was truly a game franchise that I loved, that I avidly looked forward to whenever I heard it announced. Yet, despite playing through this game nearly three times at this point, I cannot excuse the ball of mediocrity that is Lords of Shadow. No matter the console, no matter how well done the port is, I cannot recommend this game, and I am sad to say that I’ve wasted too much time trying to force myself to love something that is not only undeserving of it, but also a failure to the series name that this should be abortion tries to live up to.",

The secrets have to be unlocked by returning to the levels later (at least the majority of them). This might count as 'Metrovanian', but the rest of the game certainly isn't. While the fighting feels fluent and the variety of attacks really works well in the game, the frequent use of QTE during almost any fight really got to me. If you like this kind of gameplay the game will be well worth it for you.  Just not a game for me as an old school Castlevania player.",

It begins quite slow fighting Goblins and lycanthropes reminiscent of Lord of the rings not Castlevania, however around 6-7 hours in the game shifts and becomes darker, you quickly forget the lush forest scenes that you travelled through previously and embrace a more familiar settings a eerie town, a abbey and of course a castle.   Good points  +Music - It's not your typical chip tuney cheese of old castlevania but instead well composed pieces with a lot of depth, not to everyone's taste if your not willing to forego your nostalgia  +Art - The settings are incredible, the graphics are good but it's the art and the art direction that make the game stand out they get the most out of it by locking the camera in place +Combat - Alot of variety and generally really fun switching between differnt 'stances' Neutral, Light and dark and then there's other items that enhance your abilities beyond that +Story - I really enjoyed it, it's dark fairy tale reminiscent of something like the brothers grim. Good doesn't always triumph evil   Bad Points  -Combat - Variety yes, however it could be more tighter, Example Air combat yes you can launch enemies into the air but you quickly realise that being in the air is dangerous with no air block/air dodge you sort of hover in the air for unattended times open to enemy attacks, there is a stomp move that brings you down quicker but really should have taken a page out of bayonetta book here,   -Oh the camera, I understand why they did it (I previously mentioned beautifull scenary) but the camera in combat can get stupid, it fixed so depending on the angle of the player and the enemy there can be times were you get punished cheaply from attacks off screen, not good.  Would I recommend it yes, if you enjoy GoW combat, willing to give it 5-6 hours to get to the good bits (it's fairly lengthy game at around 20-30 hours) and not looking for the next SOTN. I can't wait for the sequel",

If you also wanna grab all achievements you probly get even more hours and the included DLC is a ton of fun.

Unfortunately, problems lie in some of the wall climbing. If you've played Uncharted, think of that, except take what you know of that game and chuck it out the window. If you want to jump and grab onto another wall while you're already hanging on one, don't push the analog stick in the direction you want to jump. Instead, take your thumb off the joystick and wait until he automatically faces the direction himself, THEN press the jump button. This took me quite a while to get used to and also led to many frustrating deaths just simply due to the mechanics not being as fluid as they should be. Aside from those minor nitpicks, the game is very well optimized and runs at a silky smooth 60fps. The story is surprisingly pretty decent as it does have its own twists at times. There are different combos you can do with the whip, though once you get a few favorites, you might end up repeating those sets throughout the rest of the game. All in all, I highly recommend it and I'm definitely looking forward to the sequel. Hopefully the platforming will be ironed out better by then.",

It truly is a great game. Graphically, it’s beautiful. The cut scenes are amazing, and the story is really enjoyable. The gameplay is a lot like God of War, Dark Siders, Devil May Cry, etc. I personally, did not have any issues with the controls. Keep in mind, this game was never designed to be played with a Mouse and Keyboard. If you try, you will have a bad time. Save yourself some headaches, and use a controller. Now, I don’t have an FPS counter, because I honestly don’t need a number to tell me if I’m enjoying a game or not. All I care about is that the frame rate is smooth, and constant, and for me, it was while playing Castlevania. I have an i7 5820K and an XFX AMD Fury, with a SSD, so just about any game runs great for me. The puzzles are a good challenge, but the game allows you to skip them, if puzzles are not your thing. Some of the boss fights offered a nice challenge as well. Overall, this is the Castlevania game I’ve been waiting for all these years, and I am extremely satisfied with my $8 purchase.  I give this game, a solid 8/10.",

Therefore I managed to play with my ps3 controller instead which helped out a lot (it was overall easier to navigate the character). The other issue is the 'DLC' in the game, after you are done with the main story, it will continue on as a DLC mission for Gabriel. This mission is awesome until you get to the final. There you will battle a creature that will get on your nerv so much that you unintentionally will eat your fingers in frustration and slam your head in the wall xD Now I had no problem battling that creature.. until I realized that it would take 40 minutes to take down 10% of it´s HP.

            "review_text": "I had previously written a negative review of this game, but gave it a second chance... This review will reflect both the positives and negatives of this game  Let me start with a warning; there are a few sections in this game that were poorly designed. You will commit mistakes that force you to repeat annoying, tiresome actions; be it QTEs that pop out of nowhere on the least appropriate times, or certain actions that are anything but obvious..among other things. Try to be a little patient; when the game isn't trolling you, it's actually pretty good.  This game is often described as a God of war-like game, a spectacle fighter with puzzles and platforming. That is somewhat accurate..but not entirely.  One thing to keep in mind is that the 'spectacle fighter' part of the game is a bit toned down, in the sense that the enemy behavior patterns push you to play in a more traditional way. It's not really about chaining crazy combos, but rather about dodging, blocking and hitting at the right times, almost as if you were in an old Castlevania game, but in a 3D area that allows more freedom and flow. The fact that the game doesn't have a combo count should be a dead giveaway that it's not 'exactly' the kind of game you might be expecting.  This is both good and bad; on one hand, it's good for variety's sake; instead of playing something you already played in a different setting, you're experiencing something that has its own place, and that is enjoyable. The 'bad' part is divided into two points; the most obvious is that it's bad if what you're looking for is indeed an insane combo-chain spectacle game. you should try DmC for that, a game that i also like a lot. the other, is that, unfortunately, the game's fixed camera angle gets in the way of your 'strategic' gameplay and reactions times as well.. You can often get hit not because of your fault, but the camera.  I also have one complaint with the controls. When you jump, you have very little control of your movements/direction..and that is fine i guess, it's understandable. However, what isn't, is that your attacks get tied to your jump direction, which heavily limits your aerial capabilities. This is extremely noticeble in the Forgotten One boss fight of the Resurrection DLC where the weak spots are very high and you can often hit nothing but air due to the game's stubborn jump mechanics.  Aside from that, we have a veeeery good soundtrack, awesome voice acting by TV stars Patrick Stewart and Robert Carlyle, ocasionally impressive visual design, ocasionally good puzzles and platforming.. i say ocasionally because the Music Box level is terrible! One of those sections i warned you about..  Bottom line; there are some moments where you'll tear your hair out screaming 'WTF DEVS?! what were you thinking?'. But when that isn't happening, you'll be having a great time, so i recommend it, specially because the sequel is shaping up to be one of 2014's best games. ",

When it comes to bringing Castlevania to the PC platform, then this is probably the best way to open up the franchise to new people, especially when the sequel is arriving February 2014. If you’re a PC gamer who has never played Castlevania: Lords of Shadow or a hardcore fan that is looking to replay the game before the sequel hits, you should certainly pick up the PC version. It’s undoubtedly the “Ultimate” version, and with DmC being the only recent title to offer similar gameplay on the platform there isn’t much choice when it comes to these types of games. Sitting at a welcoming £19.99 on Steam (and cheaper in other places), there is plenty here for your money that would make even Dracula come out of the shadows for a taste.",

Graphics 8/10 - Not Bad by any means but recently i have been playing a lot of games with Better quality Graphics. Low quality pre rendered video at the end was awesome but looked horrible not sure if it was a problem on my end or if thats how it was just pixelated spoilt it a bit.  Sound 8/10 - Again not bad and some really nice music in there just didnt feel it as much as others.  Gameplay 7/10 - Combo system is good fun and has interesting points and parry/Block mechanic was nice lets you learn an enemy and use his attacks against him, was fun after playing Dark Souls not so long ago, Some Epic boss fights which were sometimes more tedious and frustrating than Satisfying. The Main Reason i score it so low is because of the FIXED CAMERA yes i know it had one before i got it but after playing quite a lot of this style of game recently i just felt so restricted by it, they made a nice looking world for us to battle through but we could only see it from one angle, Just felt it could have been better with the ability to look around freely rather than be locked into some rather interesting angles at points but on the whole they were ok and pointed to the next objective or moved out to show the next grapple point etc i suppose it was different to all the others i played because of this but when i was fighting losing enemies behind me and around me not seeing them charge their attacks was a little frustrating. Puzzles were fun and some of them difficult but not to the point of frustration, platforming was ok but with the camera zooming in on key locations wasnt really difficult to work out where to go, did get a bit tiresome towards the end but meh.  Story 8/10 - Solid, well told, but a bit repetitive and long winded the whole speech from Someone near the end felt long winded and drawn out for like 3 minutes of what could essentially have been said in 30 seconds. Some high calibre Actors hired to voice the characters which didnt really help to get the story across but i guess helps from a selling point of view if its got famous people 'ITS GOT TO BE GOOD' ...   Overall 7.5/10 - I played it but towards the end it felt a little grindy and a little repetative the long winded speeches at the end were a tad boresome and Deaths voice made me chuckle as he sounded a bit jesterish, a decent experience and one that is enjoyable, just not as good as i had hoped, Hopefully they release a sequel where they take the Voice acting budget and add in a Free view camera or something.

Even though the game is quite linear, there are still many opportunities to stop and admire the breathtaking vistas. Lush forests, ancient ruins, towering gothic castles, hellish pits, this game has many amazing sights to take in, and woven through it all is one of the most haunting and heartbreaking soundtracks ive ever heard. If you appreciate a good soundtrack, you will love the work of composer Oscar Araujo in this game. As far as voice acting goes, this game has quite a stellar cast, Patrick Stewart, Robert Carlyle and Jason Isaacs to name a few. Great performances!  Actual Gameplay: Fun and Challenging The game does a great job of easing you into the controls and makes sure to pop up a tutorial whenever a new gameplay element appears. As the game progresses the enemies get tougher and more numerous and the puzzles get more devious. If you enjoy puzzles, this game has oodles of them! The worst thing about this game i think (apart from the saw blade wall at the end *shudders*) is the fixed camera. It causes some awkwardness throughout the game. Other than that, I highly recommend this game. I just completed my second playthrough of it. I love this game and in my opinion it is worthy of the castlevania name.",

And English is not my main language, so bear with any mistakes I make. ^^  This game is pure awesomeness. Not even chocolate chip cookies were able to take me away from the pc while I was playing it... and that's a serious matter. Trust me.  I've played other Castlevania titles and to be honest I feel that the aproach made in this game to the whole 'evil monster slaying and save the world' is the most appropriate - a hack and slash style feels more right to the 'evil monster slaying and save the world' thing than a platformer in which you turn to one side whip-whip-whip-whip, turn to the other whip-whip-whip-whip. Naturally, when the first Castlevania titles appeared, platforming and whip-whip was astonishing - it was another age :p - and I enjoyed all the Castlevania titles i played, but I feel that for the quest the main character has ahead of him an hack and slash style feels more adequate.  Many people complain that this isn't like an old Castlevania. Of course not, it's a reboot - it's not meant to be like an old Castlevania. And for a reboot it is a good idea (if not mandatory) to try a different approach. And I believe it was amazingly well done.  The story is awesome (may take a few missions to understand what is going on, but I believe that was intended - it helps build intrigue), the soundtrack is awesome, the main character development is awesome (if you play the game and the dlc's you actually see the whole evolution the main character goes through, with a little surprise in the end... hehehehe), the gameplay is awesome - it has one small problem or other (to me, it was the time advanced moves take to work - certain moves take far too much time and the main character is defenseless while executing them, making those moves unviable in battle, in my opinion) but nothing to worry too much about; in fact, these details seem to have been corrected in the second game, from what I've read, though I haven't played it yet (BUT I WILL, MUAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!).  Regarding the story: I actually am very gratefull to this reboot because, in my opinion, it helped create a whole, coherent story for the Castlevania universe - something the previous title's never cared much for, in my opinion. Every new title just felt like 'oh, check it out, Dracula is back again! The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥! Well, let's kick his ♥♥♥... AGAIN.'; this isn't the negative aspect - what's negative is that, in general, there isn't a coherent connection (story-wise) from one game to the other. An example: I played Order of Ecclesia, and in that game you don't play with a Belmont, since they had vanished. But 36 six years before the events in Aria of Sorrow - chronologically after the events of Order of Ecclesia - the Belmonts defeated Dracula permanently. ...where the hell were they at the time of Order of Ecclesia then?... It is stated that the villagers you find in OoE are descendants of the Belmonts, but that doesn't really convince me enough to believe that that was the reason why a Belmont showed up after. It doesn't feel right, at least to me. In Lords of Shadow the story is a whole, coherent block. You have the first game that shows the first Belmont and his quest, you have Mirror of Fate, that is good to make a connection (story-wise) to the second game, and finally you have the second game, which concludes the story. But it is a whole block, and it is coherent, which is something that the previous titles were not - they felt more like separate stories, vaguely related to each other. At least to me.  In short, this game is awesome. But all this is just my opinion, so...  Peace!",

            "review_text": "Patrick Stewart is the narrator.  Second Update: The Clocktower level... ♥♥♥♥ this game, ♥♥♥♥ it right in the gameplay mechanics it literally never tells you about. What a spectacularly boring and frustrating level. At this point I am only playing it to get to the second one which looks and sounds much better. Much like The Force Unleashed it is supposedly shorter and that's usually said as a con. This game is dragging the ♥♥♥♥ out and a shorter game will be very welcome. Now as an avid fan of the Legacy of Kain games I am somewhat used to mildly frustrating gameplay and puzzles I'm not interested in but this, this just takes the cake, ♥♥♥♥♥ in it and serves it up at an orphans birthday party.  First Update: Well, I was enjoying this very much. That is until I got to the vampire section. I'm getting ahead of myself here though. So far the story has been pretty decent and having stupidly played the demo for the second one before this I think I know where it's heading, which is to a perty cool place.   The voice acting is, at the very least, good enough. I think it might just be the accents that throw me a little but like I said, Patrick Stewart is in it. As a narrator he's good but I can't help feel the actual character he plays doesn't suit his voice. I hate to say it but he sounds kinda weak in contrast to his character. Personally I would've preferred someone like Simon Templeman. Still, good voice work. The sets, character models and overall graphics hold up well and look downright good.   The gameplay is where things start to crumble just a tad. It's your basic hack'n'slash with Metroidvania... Oh my God, that's only just clicked. So yeah, you slice mo'♥♥♥♥ers up with your chain blade which looks pretty cool. I'll say at this point that I've not played many of, nor have I really cared for the old Castlevania games, so take that into account. You upgrade stuff with experience points, you find new stuff to go back and find other upgrades in previous levels and you get shiny new toys as you progress. The parrying system is the only part I have trouble with in regards to the combat. First of all it feels like you have to parry a little earlier than it feels like you should. Secondly, it's pretty difficult to see when the enemy's attacking as the white flash, telegraph thingy blends into your own attacks and at close range it gets very tricky to tell when you should be blocking.   That only got on my nerves from time to time, generally it's still pretty doable to fight well. The main thing that pisses me off is the one thing that literally no game has ever done well and yet there are developers out there that still insist on using. Fixed camera angles!!! Yerp, them ♥♥♥♥♥. In combat it's not a problem but there's a fair amount of platforming sections in this. Now I get they wanna show off ther fancy scenery but I find it looks a lot nicer when you control what you see. It also plays a lot better that way. The amount of times I've messed up a jump because three feet from the edge of a cliff the camera turns and so do the controls. Just... eurgh. Whatever.  I still enjoyed it a fair amount up to this point, despite the flaws alreadty mentioned. But then, today, I got to the vampires. Now ironically it wasn't them that sucked the life out of the game, it were the skeleton warriors. They're just so boring to fight. They don't look like they're getting hit when you attack they block an awful lot which makes it even more dull and you basically just have to defend yourself until they crumble. But then you gotta attack the pile of bones on the floor to kill 'em, otherwise they get up and it's round two. The worse part is when you try to attack the pile of dead bones, Mr. Whippy treats them like a pile of dead bones. He just never seems too eager to actually attack them and instead opts for attacking the others. It just makes the whole thing tedious.   I dunno, maybe I'm over reacting. I'll finish the game and update it again if need be. I still recommend it though, especially if you like a good ol' hack'n'slash with mystical, Pans Labyrinth-esque elements.",

Music: Actually I didn't pay much attention to the music, or should I say I haven't noticed any great melodies as other Castlevania games always have.  Gameplay: Although slashing the enemies and doing all kinds of stuff feel satisfying, the game can be very frustrating. Most of your attacks will not even slow down your enemy, and you do need to block and doge a lot. The 'synchronized block' requires trial and error, but unfortunately you do not have much hit points. Therefore there's not much chance for new players to try out and get used to the enemies' attack patterns. Also there are too many quick time events, which are boring and annoying, and most of them are unnecessary. Generally speaking, I do not think the gameplay meets my expectations. Oh yes, this game has a fixed camera, which I believe should not be found in an action game published just last year. I know it's a PC remake of an old game, but KONAMI should make more improvements.  Generally speaking, the game is quite enjoyable (after you get used to the combat), but it does need a lot of polish. I am looking forward to the sequel.",

Which is extremely clunky, even with a controller. Every few minutes, between button smashing(you get to mash two different buttons! NEXT GEN!), the Ice Giant will swipe you off, causing you to lose a chunk of your health.  Also, there's no way to actually recharge your health during boss fights. Or during the gameplay, for that matter. Or between levels. That means if you screw up, you could permanently lose the game. There are no turkeys, no potions, nothing except some very scarce wells.

Most of the personalities of the characters feel like they were added into the game at the very last minute.  The gameplay is 'ok' in and of it itself, just rather unoriginal and repetitive. The thing that ruins the gameplay for me though, is the cinematic camera. All of the camera angles are design to be good looking, rather than to provide the best possible point of view for gameplay. The problem with this is that very often enemies will be off screen, where you can't see them, and then suddenly attack at you, without giving the player a proper chance to react. Also a lot of the enemies often sorta gang up on you, and will just knock you to the ground and hit you again, before you can get up and do anything. Stuff like this just makes the game feel tedious and cheap.  As I mentioned in the beginnig, the art design is really good and the game looks beatifull in a lot of scenes, but in my opinnion, no amount of pleasing aesthetics can salvage badly designed gameplay. Also inorder to look at the concept art for the game, you have to collect experience points to buy them. This is acceptable in itself, but if you buy the art once it doesn't seem to stay accessable, meaning that you are going to have to buy it again. I'm only mentioning this, because in my oppinion the art was the best part of the game, so why not just let me enjoy it without the hassle?

While combat isn't the best in hack'n slash the enviroments and atmosphere towards the end are just incredible. That said, the game is pretty long and the first hours can seem like wasted money but in the end it will pay back. On the other note, the game has some great bosses althought most of them share the same basic fighting mechanics, and few are like rip-offs from Shadow of The Colossus.  Puzzles in this game are sometimes really hard and some are skippable, especially the sun clock which... is unbeatable if you don't search for an answer from the forums. The fixed camera can make a single jump in some point a pain in the ♥♥♥. (DLC).  During the last hours of the main story I actually smiled to the epicness.",

Story, character development, gorgeous fantasy environments, replay value, great hack-n-slash gamelay that grows with the game and the player. I only had 2 major quirks with this game the first being fixed camera angles. Usually this means the camera is going to pan around like they do in the movies and really capture the mood of your setting. This really is great, but someone needs to just give me control of the damn thing when I'm in a battle. The second are unresponsive controls. It seems like the controls wait for animations to complete before becoming responsive again. Sometimes you need the character to respond immediately to what you're mashing on the controller but instead will pause and get whapped in the head by a giant boulder. There is a particular part in the 2nd DLC where this feels really unfair.",

The end is nigh and what an outstanding story this game has told so far! In the past, some players have complained about this game not being enough like a Castlevania game and, to be fair, where game mechanics are concerned I can sometimes see that argument as valid, but a powerful story with constant nods to its humble beginnings is where this game pays the most homage to its predecessors. The imminent release of Lords of Shadows 2 will see the re-boot story told in full and I just know that, at the end of that game, I will be asking myself, 'Does it really have to end?', mostly thanks to the wonderful experience I've already had with this game. I now have great faith in the future of Mercury Steam, the developers of these games, and I will be watching for whatever they work on from here on out.",

Somebody at Konami thought it would be a good idea to port a boss-fighting trick from controller to keyboard. You're supposed to rotate 360 degrees, which is easily enough done with an analog stick, but sucks with the keyboard. And the camera shows an angle that the designers consider helpful, but you may not. Meaning you run north into a new room, which is shown from another angle, and suddenly running north takes you back out of the room. It gets more frustrating when the camera keeps facing a boss, even though you need to jump and hit a switch on the floor on the other side of the room. The whole setup makes some fights a matter of luck, not skill. Thanks, but we have card games and dice-rolling RPGs for that. Which is a pity, because the rest is good. Nice graphics, great voice acting, a nice enough story of Good vs. Evil, and some battles (normal + bosses) are actually fun. But dreading the next boss fight because of shtty controls/camera doesn't make me want to go forward, it makes me uninstall the game.",

But considering the point of this review isn't about Symphony of the night, I'll set that aside. Now talking about lords of shadow , it is an hack n´slash game with some rpg elements and with a great story. The game is about Gabriel , a knight who losts his wife and just wants to find a way to bring her back to the earth. Gabriel believes that the gods don´t care about earth anymore and he wants to show them that they are wrong.(I won´t spoil about it) Talking about the gameplay , the combat system is awesome because it has many weapons to use like daggers and upgrades to the main weapons , the combos are also amazing. Gabriel can use different powers to defeat his enemies. This game also makes use of a good parkour system (that reminds me of Prince of Persia).  Overall the game is awesome (of course , for me). It has few bugs, however they don't don´t impact the gameplay at all. You'll most likely go through the whole game without noticing a single issue.  8,3/10",

Second of all - goblins, trolls, forest spirits...where are all the cheesy horror monsters? Why this looks like a classic medieval fantasy instead of gothic horror-themed game?  And this game is boring. Fighting is boring, and that's a surprise for me, because I love brawlers. You are constantly served with new mechanics and moves. YOU HAD TWO ♥♥♥♥ING ATTACKS IN CASTLEVANIA.

The writing got worse, the whining hero got worse, the monologuing (don't get me started on the 10 minute+ bit at the end of the primary game), but the levels got worse.

If you enjoy games like Darksiders, God of war and the Legacy of Kain games, this might interest you. It's not Dark souls or Diablo 3 but I had a feeling while playing this that it's got a similair aura about it, maybe it's the atmosphere or the backdrops but it's a nice dark atmospheric game.   Graphically, very impressive. The character models and textures are brilliant. Sometimes the areas can get so busy to the eye that you arent even focusing on how pretty the game looks. There were moments I stopped just to look and take a screenshot, something I don't often do unless a game area looks awe inspiring and there are many moments of that here.   Sound wise, sometimes I like to turn of music to appreciate the ambient noise, the developers have worked very hard in this respect. The quality of music however, it reeeeaaally suits the gameplay!  Gameplay is frantic! Sometimes you can get by with button mashing but with certain encounters there is a certain skill to play this. If I could say one thing about the gameplay it's ' Easy to pick up, tough to master'. I felt like the game threw a lot of moves and combo's at me to learn but I realised after a while that they are just there to spice it up a bit, give the player the power to choose HOW they want to play. You're going to find that you'll buy all the combo's but just use the ones you want to play how you want, this to me is a brilliant design! It's not Batman combat, close but I'd say a little more challenging but not so much as Dark souls.   The story keeps you going and wanting to find out what happens next, when the game finishes, it's very nicely set up for the sequels with a nice twist or two at the end.

The difficulty curve scales nicely - Knight difficulty requires running some engagements perfectly in order to advance. Whip combat is pretty decent. There's a system of 'runes' that allow you to heal or do greater damage. Giant monsters can be tamed and ridden. If this is sounding a lot like God of War, unfortunately, it's several steps wide of the mark - but this IS very much like the feel of Onimusha. Expect lots of chamber-based combat, soul pickups, careful health management, and revisiting old maps to clear challenges or acquire pickups that you couldn't get earlier.   For: Fans of Onimusha, anybody who likes action games.  Not for: People expecting a 2D action/patformer (like Castlevania), or a 2D a/p with RPG elements (like Simon's Quest), or a 2D metroidvania (like SOTN), or a 3D exploration RPG with pets (like Curse of Darkness).",

By the time I got to the castle (5-7h?), you couldn't pry me away from the game. By the end of the game you are begging for more story and insight into the characters. Beating the game on 'normal' was difficult in boss battles with a couple of deaths (outside of DLC boss, died for hours), but just right during normal gameplay, never really dying but definitely had moments where you really needed to be aware of your health, your enemy types, and strategize your moves around that. The game felt like it was built primarily for the controller, I used both and keyboard/mouse was a joke. Playing on hard was difficult to the point of being extremely frustrating, you could die with any encounter of a 'heavy' opponent, and good luck on boss battles, I should probably mention that I was also using keyboard/mouse during this test.

            "review_text": "For those not already aware, the Lords of Shadow entries of the Castlevania series are not a part of the classic continuity; Mercury Steam has crafted a total re-imagining of the Belmont legacy (including a rather big twist as to protagonist Gabriel Belmont's ultimate fate). This is not the first Castlevania game to take place in an alternate timeline, seperate from the clasic continuity, but it is probably the most ambitious among the alternate continuities. The developers did not, however, totally abandon or forget about the series' roots, and some little winks and nudges are scattered throughout the narrative (such as the reveal of how Gabriel's weapon, the Combat Cross, comes to gain the name of Vampire Killer, the name of the whip used by the Belmonts in the classic continuity. If you are a diehard fan of the original series, you may have a hard time swallowing all the changes, but if you are able to set that aside and accept Lords of Shadow as it's own experience, then you should be able to get a fair degree of enjoyment out of the story.   Castlevania: Lords of Shadow is, at it's core, a standard action adventure game which does not stray far from formula. This is not, necessarily a bad thing, though, as it follows the formula fairly well. LoS is simply an example of a game which does nothing new, but does everything well. You start at point A of the stage, and work your way towards the end, fighting enemies and solving puzzles along the way. You earn experience points, which allow you to purchase more combos, and upgrade your weapons and abilities along the way, allowing you to progress further, and also to revist previous stages an access areas you couldn't before. The combat controls are fluid and work well, though you should definitely play with a controller rather than the keyboard. I know it sounds obvious, but I was forced to play the majority of the first two chapters with my keyboard, and the experience was, at best, uncomfortably passable and, at worst, nearly unplayable. Once I was able to use a controller, however, things improved a hundred fold, and the game became much more fun.   If I had to cite one major complaint about gameplay, I would say that the stages are fairly linear. For someone like me, who enjoys exploration, this felt rather limiting, especially since the stages are so beautifully designed. This doesn't do much to decrease the enjoyment, however, and in fact is almost nostalgic, as this makes the game more similar to the early installments of the series, before Symphony of the Night introduced us to the 'Metroidvania' style of gameplay which defined the series for so many years. On that note, you may want to brace yourself for a notable lack of castles; Tomb Raider-vania may have been a better title for this game, as you spend more time in ancient ruins and lush forests and jungles than, but that is mere semantics and not a huge issue in the overall scheme.   The bottom line is this: Lords of Shadow is a solid action-adventure game with an enticing narrative, and if that is what you are looking for then you should be able to enjoy this game.",

            "review_text": "Castlevania: Lords of Shadow is a reboot for the franchise and it does quite well. You play as Gabriel Belmont, of the Order of Light, which is sworn to defend against the terrible (and decidedely evils which now stalk the land with impunity after what appears to be God's withdrawal from the world.  The story is good; the only thing really negative I have to say is that the plot's segue to the sequel is left barely explained, which diminishes the impact of a rather effective climax.  The art direction is fantastic, and the game's voice-actors are a professional cast including Patrick Stewart. The soundtrack won the the International Film Critics Association's award for 'Best original score for a videogame or interactive media.' The game features a fixed camera which makes it more cinematic; the environment is also designed to utilize this, making scenes more impactful than they would be if the player had control over the camera.  The combat system is also very good and centers around executing combos and attacking tactically; as you progress through the game Gabriel gains increasingly more sophisticated combos and impressive moves to the point where it can be a little hard to keep all your options in your head at once. Combined with the aesthetic choices of the developers, a well-fought battle gives no small satisfaction.  Interspersed between combat are prince-of-persia/assassin's creed ledge grappling and platforming and puzzles to solve. The puzzles vary in difficulty from being clever, but easy, to requiring real strategy to complete. You can skip these puzzle sequences, but only by forfeiting the experience reward.  It took me 20 hours to complete the story on Knight difficulty (level 3 of 4), with the hardest difficulty Paladin being unlocked when you complete the game. (There are some 3.5 hours worth of cutscenes, narration, and quick-time event cinematics.) The levels are episodic which allows you to return to specific levels whenever you like, and doing so will yield benefits: you have another opportunity to discover hidden upgrades, and each episode has its own level-specific challenge to complete. Even after completing the story there is still a lot of gameplay to be had in order to fully complete it. The DLC's add even more collectibles and extend the plot.  There are few things that detracted from the game.  The epilogue makes little sense.  You need to play the DLC's in order for the epilogue to the core game to make sense. Secondly, the fixed camera - though it does wonders aesthetically - can work against you at times, either making it difficult to see alternative paths switching your movement directions on you in awkward ways. Sometimes the fixed camera forces you to fight in a specific part of a room if you want to be able to see well enought to fight.   The only other thing I have to complain about is the checkpoints. For whatever reason, the developers decided to put the checkpoints some distance away from the real difficult parts, and some of the sub-bosses. That means if you're having trouble defeating a tough enemy, you've got to spend a few minutes ledge-grabbing and platforming first. If you die a lot, this gets old and tedious very fast.  A gamepad is highly recommended; the game is clearly designed for analog controls.",

Gabriel's main weapon is the Combat Cross, which is a retractable chain whip in the form of - wait for it - a giant metal cross. This provides for some relatively basic hack-n-slash combat, though they do feature some nifty combos and the cross  is  upgradeable. You get some secondary weapons as well, such as throwing daggers and an amulet that lets you absorb magical energy (neutral) and convert it (light or shadow) to varying effects. There is also a bit of platforming thrown into the mix that is, to be perfectly honest, neither here nor there - what I mean is, it's neither terrible nor is it particularly amazing either.

As a pure adventure game it has got a lot to offer: nice graphics, gorgeous vistas, cool monsters, epic bosses, and an interesting story with superb voice acting from Robert Carlyle and Patrick Stewart. It is also very long, so you definitely get your money's worth from this one.  It is virtually littered with cut scenes that drives the story forward, with most of them skipable.  The game is split in chapters containing a varying amount of levels. Every finished level, in any chapter, can be played again right after it is finished the first time. This comes in handy if you didn't find (or couldn't get to) every item in that particular level.  To add some extra replayabilty, a trial is also unlocked for every finished level. Some of these are a cakewalk, and some are painstakingly hard.  The gameplay is a mix of platforming and fighting. The platforming is pretty straightforward and easy, but will sometimes punish you if you get sloppy. The fighting works really well once you get the hang of all the combos and the dodge and block moves. There is also frequent use of action buttons, which could be irriitating, but works pretty good here (kinda).  The ordinary gameplay is broken off with the occasional puzzle and boss fight. Some of the puzzles are really clever and you need your brain, raher than your reflexes, to beat them. As for the boss fights, I played the game on normal difficulty, and though some of the bosses were really challenging, it never felt hopeless fighting them. Just a couple of tries later the adventure continued.  This ultimate edition also contains a ton of unlockable, very nice artworks, as well as some other in-game extras. It also contains two DLC chapters, and here comes my only real issue with this game. Don't get me wrong, they both look as good as the earlier game, and also serves to flesh out and deepen an already great story. The thing is that they try to make it last longer by riddle it with puzzles, as opposed to the earlier game when they were occasional, and some irritatingly hard platforming sequences. There is also a boss fight that many probably will find a bit unfair (I found it reeeeeally f-ing hard on just normal difficulty and I rage quit more than once).  Besides that last part, I can do nothing but recommend this excellent adventure game. I will definitely buy LoS 2 when it arrives to PC.",

Main protagonist Gabriel isn't really much of a character, and I found it tough to cheer for him on his quest. Boss fights are okay, and the ending is interesting and left me wanting to know what happens. The downsides to this game are the bad camera angles and the controls. The combination of the two can make sections of the game unecessarily difficult. It seems that they were trying to go for an artistic look and feel for the game, but aesthetics should in no way overshadow the gameplay, and that's what has happened here. The DLC is short but somewhat interesting as they try to introduce some new elements to make the game less stale. Overall, the ultimate edition gets a 6.5/10. Wait till the price drops if you want to check it out.",

Super fast load times, skip cut scenes really quick and just get in to the action. It also has some unique options, such as showing your health bar near your character so it's harder to lose track, as well as health bars on individual enemies. There were more to unlock, but I haven't unlocked them yet.   Personally, I enjoyed this Castlevania experience. It doesn't homage the old games very well, but it isn't supposed to. It is a *new* experience. A new origin, a new everything. And while it does take the series a gorgeous new direction, there are still throwbacks to the old games if you look for them.  It's also challenging. Four difficulty modes, and individual trials to complete after each level.",

That's because it's all it is: a big long corridor until you find enemies, where you punch the enemies for a little bit until the cutscene yanks the game out of your hand or you're prompted to do timed button presses, instead of just letting you kill the enemies like a real game. It's really annoying and makes you tired very fast.  Do you think it looks a bit like Castlevania: Symphony of the Night? Or at least like Castlevania: Curse of Darkness? Think again. There's no map whatsoever. Why would you need it if it's just a big corridor of a game? There's no variety. Everything is scripted for you to just follow the path.  It looks beautiful but there's the excuse of a game you have to play to see the rest, so it's not like you feel like doing it after a while. You just turn it off and do a bad review on Steam instead, I guess.  Want a game where you level up and explore to find stuff? Buy a Castlevania game… but not this one.",

            "review_text": "I originally pre-ordered this game on PS3, and have now played it on PC with the DLC included. First, for those of you have already played it, the DLC adds another 2-3 hours of gameplay. The graphics look great and the game runs at a better framerate than its console counterparts. The DLC has not received as much care as the main game. The first DLC chapter is puzzle based, and though the puzzles are interesting some of them are needless and frustrating. The second DLC is some platforming and a rather frustrating boss battle. The boss itself is very cool but fighting him becomes tedious in the later stages, and I honestly recommend switching the game to EASY mode just to get through the fight. Bottom line, $10 is the right price to get this game at if you are wanting to replay it.  For those of you have never played this game, the best thing this game has going for it is the art direction. It will absorb you into the Castlevania world and you'll care about the story and the characters, and eveything looks great. If you're a fan of the fantasy genre, this is the game for you. The story in this game is non-generic and is filled with a lot of care and attention to detail to bring the world to life. The game is LONG by action game standard (15 hrs for the main story), and there is incentive to replay chapters as certain skills you acquire during the game open up new areas to access.   The combat system is Devil-May-Cry-esque, and is generally quite fun. There are things to unlock and special abilities to learn, so new things are constantly getting thrown to prevent you from getting bored. Enemies are extremely varied, and have special strategies required to defeat them. Boss battles are for the most part well done, some occuring on grand scales (think Shadow of the Collosus). There are also lots of very clever puzzles in this game, which may require a piece of paper and pen to visualize and solve quickly. But if you don't feel like solving them, you can opt to have the solution. There is a lot of platforming as well, and it is done rather well to break up the action sequences. It's not going to be as good as some of the tomb raider or prince of persia games, but it has its place.  A few gripes I have with this game are the invisible walls. They drive me nuts as I like to look for secrets and often you try to go to a certain area only to be met with an invisible wall you can't go past. Second, is the game is a bit too liberal with the checkpoint system, and lets you play rather carelessly. I guess you won't get frustrated as much as a result. Finally, I would have liked to have an extra weapon or two aside from the whip/chain to add some depth to the combat system (this is being adressed in the sequel).  Overal this game is around a 9/10 for me. I would add that the sequel is releasing in Feb and hopes to improve the game in every way. Is this game worth $30 for newcomers? I would definitely say yes. As someone who played it twice now, I had just as much fun going through it a second time as I did the first.",

Character facial animations could have been a little better but the details, lighting and landscapes are all excellent. As for the gameplay, it's a pretty good mixture of platforming, fast-paced combat, and puzzles that reminds me of God of War, Prince of Persia, Soul Reaver and Shadow of the Colossus all mashed up together.   I do have one major criticism though. The game does get a little heavy-handed with the Quicktime events in an attempt to add a more cinematic flair to combat but it gets repetitive after a while. Pressing the button at the wrong time during a QTE usually means having to repeat the whole sequence, and basic enemies and bosses alike usually regain a small portion of their health back when that happens. Every boss battle requires you to do several QTE's correctly throughout the fight in order to defeat them.  The game's difficulty could be seen as either good or bad depending on personal preferences, but this game is HARD, even on the easiest setting. Enemies are completely unforgiving and can take quite a beating before they go down. Groups of them will gang up on you and attack you simultaneously if you're not careful.  Overall I loved this game. It's not without it's faults, but definitely worth playing.   Also, PATRICK mother-f***in' STUART.",

As a Castlevania game there are of course puzzles which end up being rather clever and a lot of fun to solve as they are neither too complex nor too easy with only one that I found frustrating.  Gameplay and combat are well done and fun with sweet-looking and powerful combos à la Devil May Cry/God of War/Bayonetta which become increasingly more badass and useful as you unlock them through an effective leveling-up and upgrade system. The enemies and environments are also epically MASSIVE at times &amp; nicely varied and appropriately thematic as you first battle werewolves as you progress towards the lycan lord in forested areas, followed by vampires in a sinister and GIGANTIC European castle and its environs where you confront the necessary vampire master and finally a swampy area filled with zombies and its lich lord. The only short-coming I can think of it that most enemies can become easy to defeat once you unlock the faeries and especially the ultimate magic moves towards the 2nd half/end of the game, but come on, you get to ride &amp; control bear-like lycans and huge spiders and use them to rain glorious PAIN upon those foolish enough to oppose a Belmont xD! Oh, it's also a little unfortunate that there is no element of free-roaming and that each new area is encapsulated by invisible walls or cliffs/etc as it would have been a real treat to explore the spooky and menacing landscapes but I wasn't overly bothered by this. However it really would have been nice as well as an added additional layer of immersion to the game if there were NPCs (villagers, survivors) that you could interact with and that would provide you with side-quests.  9/10",

Combat feels rewarding enough to push through even the toughest or most boring fights. Navigation through the games 'world' is more like navigating your harddrive directories than anything else but each stage description gives you the right information if you're looking to get 100% completion or just to go back and get that one extra power up. Voice acting is seemless with facial animations bringing the characters to life. You get a real sense of emotion from this to build further upon the story telling. Also, Sir Patrick Stewart's soothing voice narrates a brief prolog before each stage which almost never gets old.  Cons: The combat system does not stand out on its own as it feels much like other notable hack and slash titles, most like God of War. The story doesn't follow previous games however uses characters and other elements to write its own version of the Castlevania universe. This may be a con for some, I personally didn't mind. Some stages, puzzles and enemies tend to become annoyingly difficult and unforgiving even on easy. Though not many, it may impact your decision to collect 100% of the items and powerups. The cutscenes are plentiful and if you're looking for a quick way to skip cutscenes like other games, this one will annoy you by requiring you pause the game, then select 'Yes' to skip the cutscene, instead of pressing or holding a button.  Overall despite the problems this game has I still enjoyed it enough to justifiy the rating 4 out of 5. I love Castlevania, the story was deep, and the game was rewarding.
