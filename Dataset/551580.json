    "description": "Run and jump, collect coins, confront enemies and avoid traps, open gates and find secret stashes. It's a simple 2D platformer with a twist: You're not a hero from the castle about to slay an evil dragon, you're a goblin cook working for the dragon! It starts slowly but things get more and more complicated as you go.",
