            "review_text": "Edit: 5/13/2016 With the recent patch, a lot of the little problems with the game were fixed. The camera no longer jerks around when you change directions. It makes SUCH a huge difference. I really reccammend that you try the game now!  Wicce looks really cool at first glance. It does many things right as far as I'm concerned. The visuals are spot on, and I think the sort of 'puppet' style animations fit very well. Stylisticly Wicce is great. The soundtrack is really on-point, too. The soundscape provides a really nice atmospheric feel to the game, which I enjoyed.   The controls aren't great, but I didn't find the game unplayable because of them. I'd like to see some better support for customizing controls than is currently in-game.   Finally, despite all the positives, we get to the one big flaw--in my mind--with this game. The speed and camera. Having the camera shift to the left/right when you face a different direction with a platformer like this, where I'm constantly switching directions is disorienting as best. This, combined with the sheer speed at which the character moves across the screen, actually started to make me feel nausious. I often found that I couldn't track anything on the screen and it was just a blur. Yes, a 2d sidescroller gave me motion sickness.   I really suggest that, even though the camera makes -me- sick, that you give it a try. It's not a bad game, but it DOES need some fixes. Personally, I really hope that the creator addresses my concerns because I want to play the heck out of this game.   Pros: + Great Visuals + Great Audio + Cool Theme/Concept + Fun Combat  Cons: + Character moves too fast",
