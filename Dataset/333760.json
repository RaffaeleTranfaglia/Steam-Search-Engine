            "review_text": "Stylish and uncompromising, but rough in ways that wouldn't be so forgivable at a higher price point.  Vintage Year is a low-key roguelike overhead shooter, and here roguelike doesn't simply mean 'permadeath'. Vintage Year embraces the old-school roguelike style of giving the player very little information and forcing them to figure it out. It mostly works, with the gameplay being simple enough that you can learn just by fooling around, and the fast-paced live-die-repeat gameplay helps this.   You never feel like you lose much progress by making a blind choice, but sometimes the very minimal UI can be frustrating if you already know how things work, you just can't remember which item is which. Some players will find the experimentation-driven learning very rewarding, but some may find it simply frustrating.  The gameplay is rather polished, but one major area shows weakness: enemy pathfinding. Levels are randomly generated and mazelike, and the enemies have an extremely hard time navigating if there is a hard wall between them and you. And this isn't something that comes up every once in a while; enemies literally do not know how to move around a wall to line up a shot. In some ways this works to the game's benefit; if the AI could navigate better then the already hard game would be even harder, but to see the AI fail so regularly is amateurish.   Vintage Year is rather difficult, since you have very limited health and it is only replenished by (very rarely) randomly found health pick-ups. Using all the tools the game provides you is vital, as is caution. Stumbling into a room without a very good idea of what's all in it can be deadly. While unforgiving, the difficulty feels fair, though one sometimes wishes for some kind of non-random healing.  The biggest failing is in the UI. It seems designed for a controller, but the gameplay requires precision I wouldn't trust to a controller. Frankly, if you're making a PC game, main menus that can't be navigated purely through the mouse are an unforgivable sin. And furthermore, the game is inconsistent: sometimes WASD can be used to navigate menus, sometimes the arrow keys need to be used. Sometimes things are selected with the mouse, sometimes with E, and sometimes, bafflingly, with the enter key.  Finally, the progression system is very minimal, only giving unlockable characters and cosmetic items for characters. This isn't a terrible flaw, but its implentation feels more like an ingame-currency DLC store than a true progression system, in that the things you unlock may not help you get further in the game at all, and are simply alternate options to enhance replayability.  Overall, the biggest factor in my recommendation is the price. At 10 dollars I would not recommend this game, when you could get Hotline Miami for the same. But at $5.49 it's worth a look if you like roguelikes or overhead shooters. I don't know how much more I'll really play this thing, but I've definitely gotten $5.49 worth of fun out of it.",

            "review_text": "UPDATE: Nuclear throne is out of early access. As such this game is no longer recommended and the review has been updated accordingly.  This is yet another game inspired by the revival of the roguelike genre that binding of issac has done for the gaming community. The game itself is fun but it feels significantly unpolished and unbalanced... It's basically nuclear throne but inferior in almost every way. There is no proper font for things such as the amount of corks you have, and the game crashes while exiting, etc. There are bugs and very poor balancing, pretty much all of the deaths you get will be cheap and ridiculous ones. Furthermore, there are no explanations for upgrades you find by placing torches in the right places. It also lacks achievements. Normally I don't care about achievements in video games, but as this is a roguelike, having no achievements severly reduces the game's replayability. The music in the trailer is not found in this game, instead the game music is actually far more fitting towards the game and is quite good. Despite the game's cheap price, I cannot recommend this game for anyone and I would advice all those interested in this game to go buy nuclear throne instead. If you have already gotten bored of nuclear throne and you're looking for something similar then maybe you should buy this, but just remember, it feels lesspolished than nuclear throne in early access.",
