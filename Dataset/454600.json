Played it for about 15 minutes - poor mobile port, pay2play, nothing to do if you don't want to give money to developer. Just like in 60% of the same, copy pasted mobile games. Good thing - you can delete it from your account using  help.steampowered.com ",

It's a horrible horrible money grab clone of clash of clans that wouldnt make it in the real world of mobile gaming and somehow made it to steam.... I don't know how. Write to your local politician because this is the real issue.",

Pros: Kind of cool concept (even though its copied from clash of clans) Nice Gameplay if it wasent such a long wait to get to the battle  Overall the game would be fun as a mobile game because all you do is click a few buttons and put the game down for a few hours while it builds your units or constructs a new part of your base. So i give this game a 4/10 mainly because it is on the wrong platform.",

            "review_text": "This game is a complete clash of clans ripoff, but no problem, they at least changed the theme/graphics, decided to try.  The game is pay to win to the extreme, it's designed in a way that if you have infinite irl money you can cap the game in a second, because everything, from resources to building stuff instantly, can be bought with real money. It doesn't matter how good you are, the top rankers will be the guys who pay a lot, if you want to climb on the highscores, don't even bother devoting your time to this game, unless you're also willing to devote your wallet, credit card etc.  Well... At least it's fun building things and attacking people... Until you get to a higher level when things start taking ages to build, several days, even weeks, you can barely play, you can easily cap on resources by attacking, but it's futile because you can't spend then, unless you're willing to pay real money to make things build instantly.  Despite all this, I still kept playing, just had to login once in a while to build stuff and make some attacks. I also receive attacks from other players, of course, but the game gives you an option to avenge the attack, it is, attack who attacked you, great!  Here comes the reason I stopped playing: the bugs.  I used the revenge option 3 times over a week (you're only allowed to avenge attacks that destroy a certain percentage of your village), saw the enemy village, planned the attack, made the exactly right units for it and attacked! Aced every attack (100% destruction), it's really satisfying, crushed the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, stole my resources back and got my trophies back!   Well... Not so really... ON EVERY REVENGE ATTACK THE GAME BUGGED AFTER, and I had The game ♥♥♥♥ing removed the revenge option! It was like a slap on my face, not once, BUT THIS ♥♥♥♥ HAPPENED 3 TIMES!   Tl;dr Play only if you're willing to spend money and put up with bugs that throw your effort out a window.",
