            "review_text": "Probably Dharker Studio's best visual novel so far. The story's nothing groundbreaking -- a high school loner joins clubs, meets girls, and starts to come out of his shell -- but it works for what it is, and the writing is solid. The story structure -- you choose 2 out of 3 clubs and get a few different scenes/interactions depending on the combination -- makes replaying more interesting. Fully completing the game took me a little over 3 hours (skipping previous text and using a walkthrough), but there's lots of choices and some of them are tricky, so trying to find all the achievements and endings without a walkthrough will probably take you a bit longer.  Kylie, the newpaper photographer/conspiracy theorist, is the best character even if you're not romancing her, and the fact that   her investigation plotlines only end with more questions   only makes things funnier, in my opinion. The real disappointment was Ms. Nevara's ending, which I left for last. There don't seem to be any extra scenes with her in the story itself, just if you don't get on another girl's route, she'll declare her love for you out of nowhere right before the game ends.  If you're just buying this for the uncensored version, don't bother. Aside from a bit of fanservice, there's five sex scenes (one for each love interest plus an extra one for Kylie, because she's the best) which are incredibly short, add nothing to the story, and make me question the artist's knowledge of anatomy. There's also a handful of typos, and the fact that characters wear summer clothes outside in winter when it's snowing bugged me more than it should have. But if the story and art appeal to you, I'd recommend  Club Life  on a good sale.",

            "review_text": "I really enjoyed it for what it is, especially if you download the official uncensored mod from Dharker Studios. The art style is very nice and also the story is not as bad as you'd think, but as usual it's a little deep soemtimes considering the things you played this game for which are: ♥♥♥♥♥♥s, booties and nudity in general ;-) Before you buy this be sure to know tht this is not a real game, it's a graphic novel kind of thing where all you do is click through the text boxes and get maybe 3 to 4 decisions wich control the outcome of the storyline you are playing. There are 3 story lines with 3 Girls and theres one additional Girl which is in fact the teacher. So there's planty of nudity to see considering the 'games' low price. One negatvive thing tho is that there is no voice acting, it sais 'Voice Volume' in the menu but I heard none in the whole game, just some nice little music tunes, so this is one thing I could complain about. But if you into naked anime/manga girls that are nicely drawn and like to get your perverted needs packed into a nice little storyline than this is definitly the game for you, but like I said before: get that uncensored patch to get the whole experience!
