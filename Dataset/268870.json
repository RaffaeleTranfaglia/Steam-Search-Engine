            "review_text": "In the original Syndicate i wandered around shooting everything until my poofy pantsed green manthings died. I might have clicked around in some menues. After 10 minutes i quit. This revamp held (and currently holds) my attention abit longer.  The 'story' is simple and told thru a single cutscene over the whole game (i assume theres one at the end) : Theres evil corporations who dominate the world and are rich so you use four super (eventually) agents to subvert and sabotage their stuff because youre just as evil but without the dominating and rich parts.   After a short tutorial youre pretty much free to go wherever and do whatever you want to the various installations littered all over the world with no barriers except your dudes being to weaksauce to tackle some harder targets (theres border checkpoints requiring some extra work for passage but you could theoretically shoot your way thru aswell).  To remedy that you earn xp by doing stuff and leveling up your guys rpg style (no refunds) and equipment and money by doing missions - which almost always entail getting into a place and then getting out with the items alive. But theres also other stuff like simply breaking into the sectors guard station to weaken overall security and the like.  The four classes are : - Soldier : Huge beefy shooty man (or woman depending on the clone) being good at being huge, beefy and shooty. Has his own version of hacking for simple mechanical devices - Support : Scan ability (Batvision) and various increasingly powerful passive squad bonuses - Assassin : Snipz0r, more importantly can go invisible and use shortcuts other agents would need gear or augments for - Hacker : Gets the torrents and pr0n, can use drones (meh) and mindjack people for a WIDE range of shenanigans  Like mentioned you level up your dudes and put points into stuff to get abilities or stronger versions of them. Then theres also outfitting with weapons, gear (from medkits to armor to zip line hooks) and augments (i asked for this) which all can be gained by buying from the black market at horrid prices or nabbing prototypes from various places and then use them right away or research for mass production X-Com style.   Since the whole thing is basically a fancy breaking-and-entering sim it could have fallen flat on its butt very easily if the maps or tools provided were badly or boringly designed. This isnt the case, each place is unique and presents a unique layout and challenge.  Theres more stuff like the cloning and bonus attributes and whatnot but i guess this is quite enough.

Haven't had any game breaking issues, maybe a couple minor audio or path finding bugs here and there. Really is quite an achievement considering:  1) This was crowdfunded and we've seen how that can go to crap with mismanaged projects barely delivering (or not at all)   2) Big studios have spent way more money, had bigger dev teams, and taken longer to make games less fun than this one  If you like cyber-punk and can handle RTS, this game is one to get.",

            "review_text": "This game is very well done for an indie game.   I do recommend this game. I was one of the original backers of it on Kickstarter and I am happy I was.   The graphics:performance ratio is decent enough. The artstyle is a great choice, and implemented quite nicely. There are moments when the atmosphere is very present. Especially with the music, and other audio noises in the game. The lighting is a great mechanic.   I have a thing for cyber punk universes, and while this one isn't as well defined as Shadowrun, its closer to that of Blade Runner/Deus Ex as far as style. It does a good enough job, I am sure that the sequel will be more fleshed out. Story typical of most dystopian games as such. This one with a flavor of completely 'privately owned &amp; regulated market' society.  One thing I like about this game is choice, there are many different paths you can do, in any order you choose almost. Plus there are different ways you can do them. The gameplay is fun, running around stealth is a blast. The firefights are intriguing, if even mostly streamlined. Most of the abilities are warranted and useful. The level distruction is fun.   The weapons and upgrades are pretty cool, but this is something I expect to see expanded further upon in 5 Lives Studio's next game like this, such as more explosives. Some other things I would like to see in the successor are hacking billboards to promote propaganda... distraction focused gadgets... more in-doors gameplay... have vehicles play a larger role... perhaps a Co-op option for the campaign... better AI?  Overall I say this game is great fun, a throw-back to games that were around when I was a child. It can use some improvements but its pretty solid as of now. I haven't completed it, but I am a good 2/3rds through it, and if there is anything substantial I may edit my review, but if not I will leave it as is.   5 Lives Studio definitely has my attention for their next game.

Loved it to bits until my games just couldn't load anymore due to bad media/old age.  then there was the Syndicate reboot (kinda turned me off due to the FPS ishness) which is meh in my book.  And then there was Satellite Reign, and I fell in love again all over again.  Call it nostalgia or what you will, the fact that this game still resonates years on after the 1993 release speaks volumes of how original it was at that period in gaming history and how it has evolved into what it is in its current state.  Yes, the Unity engine isn't exactly well optimized for multi-threading, yes the game has it's flaws (consencutive loads in rapid succession may cause a CTD, weird AI behavior, erratic pathing) but by god I like how they moved from back then till now.  Pros + Spiritual successor to Syndicate Wars + options to pursue your objectives  + multiple paths to reach an end point + tone/style fits the era / atmosphere on the world the game is based on + a thinking game - where going loud isn't a very good idea to start something  Cons - Unity engine optimization needs work - rapid reloading of saved games may cause CTD - some actions of the agents tend to be erratic at times - that damned robo dog.  Verdict : 7.5/10 will hijack robo dog and send him into the poisonous gas again.",

Gameplay wise I will say that it is quite fun. I spent quite a lot of my time while not playing thinking about it. It is a game that makes you think and plan before going in, though there are times where you'll need to think on the spot when things didn't go as plan or when you misplaned.  Pros: -Each team members felt needed, they don't seemed totally unnessary. -Enemey AI is pretty great, it is able to react realistically most of the time. Not stupid ai nor map hack ai, just right.  Cons: -A few game breaking bugs that could be solved by reloading. Encountered 3 of them in my whole playthrough. --Not sure if pathfinding failed or collision failed, but i managed to glitch through the ground once. --Another glitched through the wall where it should be inaccessible, allowing my characters to be stuck there and got murdered by the onslught of enemies, unable to escape :&lt; --Escaping into a corner that should be accessible, but unable to get out of it afterwards(nothing could be seen blocking)  -Pathfinding again, for when stealth killing enemies. Sometimes the character will stop at one spot and just twitch, unable to find which path is better to reach the enemy.",

It brings a whole lot of new stuff to the table as well, things I never would of imagined in a game of this type. It offers a great deal of options when it comes to how you choose to play or accomplish your goals in game. It would appear that the game designers wanted to simulate that threat of breaking into a secure complex and getting caught! You can sneak in and ninja your way through by dodging cameras and hacking systems but if you get caught you better be ready to fight all the way back out the front door again. My only wish for this game is for them to offer another kickstarter or something, I wasn't aware of this game until it hit Steam and honestly I wish I had, I would love to invest in this game and see it be everything I know it can be. The Devs plan to add co-op modes and lots of new zones and features but they didn't hit some goals during the initial run on kickstarter. They have said on forums etc. that they still wish to see this happen so I'd love to suppor them as this game is just that damn good! Also, it would be beyond epic if we could actually go inside complexes! Anywway, buy this game now! You want it, trust me.",

The highlights to Satellite Reign - Atmosphere : The story takes a backseat but neo-future artstyle and sound design are great. - Infiltrator &amp; Sniper : The best two classes of your squad by far. Stealth ops is generally the course of action. These two classes are much more useful than Soldier or Support. - Infiltrator Hacking : Making enemies kill enemies. - Enemy Patrol AI : Satellite Reign does a great job of balancing the predictability of enemy patrol routes &amp; reinforcements.  The low points of Satellite Reign - Cover system : the cover points on the map are great in the beginning of the game and sketchy/missing in the reamining areas. You can find yourself stuck in walls at times. - Soldier &amp; Support : The game will keep reinforments coming if you are alerted so a full on attack never feels like a viable option. Support has some great abilities but nothing the feels like you care if he is on the mission or not. - Headquarter resource respawn : clearing an area just is see the cameras and turrets respawn is not fun.",

Pros:  - More or less open world to explore and seek missions - Different classes that can be tailored toward your needs - Good looking world design and graphics - actually challenging - you always have the choice of playstyle   Cons:   - Repetitive after a while. The missions are always the same: get into base X, sometimes get NPC X and escort him, but nothing really interesting. - Horrible menus and map design, all characters, map and loadout are put into one menu you have to click your way through - Abilities are really the boring standard cyberpunk arsenal, nothing that is even remotely interesting or new (hacking, drones, for hacker class, tank ability and berserk mode for soldier, field heal and squad buffs for support, melee and cloak for infiltrator) - Cannot save when you actually need it, no quicksave (in enemy tarrain not even out of combat) - Unclear what actions award what quantities of EXP, many things are not well enough explained   I can recommend this game, however it would have been nice if more interesting stuff would be added and the menus need a clear rework.

Unless you're really into these kinds of games or you're a fan of the original Syndicate, I'd wait for a Sale.  As a fan of the original Syndicate, Satellite Reign really does feel like a true spiritual sucessor. But like other spiritual sucessor games made years later through crowdfunding (I'm looking at you in particular Wasteland 2) too much nostalgia has crept into the more recent game, and not always for the better.  Some thoughts:  Aside from the first area and the final encounter there was rarely any need to use tactics, especially once you're well armed and have a highjacked unit or two in tow. I did just as well mid-game with all my units running and gunning together than I did trying to be creative.  AI can be a little wonky at times. Nothing too major, but you have to babysit units since they won't always return fire or find cover and sometimes they'll try to fire through objects in the environment rather than go around for a proper shot. Some pathfinding issues too, but again, it's fairly minor.  Having four units with different capabilities was a nice touch, but more often than not it just meant the other three stood around while one guy used his unique abilities. I found more utility in using their skills on the interactive bits in the environment; hacking doors, cameras and guards or shutting down generators to avoid combat.  The interface is clean and intuitive. The skill buttons were on the small side but I didn't end up using many of them aside from Scan, Hijack and Grenades.  Some players have an issue with the lack of an auto-pause, but I never found it to be a major issue. There is a 'Bullet Time' type skill that's a close enough analog.  The research and trickle-in income system (through hacking ATM's) is a mixed bag. This is one of those nostalgic bits that feels like it needed work. At least 6-8 hours of my 27 hour playtime occured while I was tabbed out, waiting for research projects to finish or money to accumulate to buy new upgrades.  The visuals and atmosphere in game was excellent. They nailed the cyberpunk aesthetic.   Although the story was forgettable the flavour text in logs, notes and descriptions had some nice touches.   All in all, it's a solid little game thats worth a playthrough.",

In this review, however, I'd like to point out the major differences of 'Satellite Reign' and the original 'Syndicate'.        Feature   Satellite Reign   Syndicate       Game Goal   get access to and dominate all city districts   complete all regional missions for world control       Level Design   open world, seperated by city districts containing public areas and restricted areas, further restricted by cameras, locked doors, NPC patrols   fixed levels, very mission-directed       mission / objectives approach   stealth, lethal / combat, decoy - may need to be adjusted ad-hoc based on current situation   persuadatron / hijack all enemies and/or combat enemy agents       combat   less meaty, more tactical, requires good mix of weapon types (laser, pulse, mechanical) and character abilities to play effectively   meaty (miniguns!), heavy abuse of the AI (hiding behind corners and pinpointing enemies)       character progression   agent experience acquired via 'doing agent things' (mostly) in restricted areas, improve agent stats via acquiring stat-wise better clones through hijacking, and looting &amp; researching better equipment from missions   character item based progression (new implants, new weapons)     ",

First thing I thought of when I saw this game was 'Syndicate' and thats what I said, and one of the devs game me a very pleasant smile and said 'One of the devs from Syndicate worked on this game'. Now as a 90's PC gamer and a cyberpunk fan, I was sold. I went back home later that day and purchased Early Access to this game. I'll admit there was nothing really to do when I first played it (e.g. no questing/tutorial). Then I logged back into this game a couple of weeks ago. I am impressed. In the 10 months since I spoke to the devs at PAX this game has improved in leaps in bounds. If you have a couple of bucks to spare definately support these guys because this game needs a sequel.",

The sound-scape and lighting do a great job of making you feel like you're running around back allies of a grungy city, on an undesireable evening when other 'undersireables' are out.  I never played the original Syndicate games, so, I didn't have any expectation of what the game 'should' be like. I can only enjoy it for what it is.  The gameplay is random enough to provide a unique experience for 'do-over' missions, and I thouroghly enjoy having to employ a number of styles to get through missions. Stealth isn't always an option, going Rambo doesn't always get the job done, sometimes you have to hunker-down to protect scientists/engineers, sometimes it's a run-for-your-life situation. But, it all comes down to chance.   The game also seems very fair. While I do have the advantages of being a light-weight, covert outfit, who is being fed information from a network of informants, I don't always have the option to 'win'. Getting caught between two factions, just as a patrol is coming out of the barracks.... no cover, no way out, It happens.   But, these actions seem to help carry the premis that you are the underdog. Early on, you get chased out of facilities, escorted off premisis, and sometimes sucker punched by the corrupt security gards, as any gang of punks would be treated.   Then, you get access to the black-market. With some upgrades, you are no longer just a gang of punks, but a true elite force to be reckoned with.  And all this, before you leave the first district.

Created by some of the folks behind the original Syndicate and its sequel Syndicate Wars, you can definitely tell there was a lot of passion behind this project. Showcasing ideas and visuals they couldn't do in the past to to the limitations of the time. Aside from a few technichal issues the game is a wonderful experience.   Pros: +Gorgeous visuals and art direction +Easy to understand mechanics +Huge lovingly crafted open world with multiple routes to accomplish objectives +Fantastic and thematically appropriate soundtrack  +Plenty of Weapons and skills to customize your agents.  Cons: -Needs optimization  -Agent cosmetic customization is a bit lacking. -Arguably slow in the beginning as your agents are hilariously weak.  If your a fan of the original Syndicate and its sequel Syndicate Wars your gonna love this, If you like strategy games with RPG elements your gonna love this.

As seen in the pictures, you command a squad of 4 units, and each unit can get better by hijacking enemy or neutral units and be sent for cloning, making classes such as the soldier as tank and infiltrator have quite a big impact based on the clone.  In addition to the game, it has quite good length (varies about if you hesitate due to cameras, guards and so on), replayability. Oh and I shouldn't forget, it has a nice, good soundtrack wether you're idle or in combat.   However, there are quite some few bugs here and there, but, in my play-time I haven't really encountered some game-breaking bugs (maybe because I haven't even bought something from the Black Market ingame). Also, the AI can be a bit questionable, especially if you have hijacked NPCs, they will not react to being fired at and will most likely just stand idle and die, however, your squad has some basic AI where they will shoot back, and perhaps take cover (I had them fully controlled throughout the game), so I can't really tell much more about Satellite Reign, other than it's really awesome.",

            "review_text": "To be completely honest, I'm on the same bandwagon as those who followed the game because they knew and loved good ol' Syndicate. I got dubious at first, but after some time I decided to give it a shot.  Essentially it could be summed as this : Came for Syndicate, stayed for Satellite Reign. I got Really hooked on all the tactical aspects, the cross references and all the stuff you need to check ahead and plan before actually doing it. For that matter, I might be the type to have been using the Support's world scan ability the most, and that gave me a pretty good idea of the degree of complexity involved in the level design. There are 4 zones. Might seem short, and that's because it is. If I could have another 2 zones, I'd take em without hesitation.   The fact is, the concept works. You have a small team of experts with the potential of being ludicrously powerful near the end, but like all Elites, you'll die in a swarm if you take the wrong approach. Meanwhile, if you're particularly patient, you can go through without being spotted at any point in time, and have that sweet sensation of being a really sneaky and cunning little twerp (which you can most likely guess, I was in my playthroughs). Another great thing I enjoyed was how you can trick civilians into tripping guard patrols, wasting their times, getting them blamed for a body they happened to walk near-by and other sort of thing that make you grin because you're allowed to shift all the blame of your nasty stuff onto some completely innocent bystander that'll end up fined or shot for the transgression.  What do I reckon could use some polishing : Well pathfinding occasionally messes up. It doesn't happen often, but still regularly enough to be noticeable. Guards tend to try to go from a door to another, and simply fail to exit. Luckily, your agents have a wide array of skill to just mess with them and get them killed. Inventory tend to be too limited, even with the Pack Mule skills available to all. But in a way it serves as much as a balancing feature as much of reinforcing the idea that you're only specializing a team of specialists further. Still, I would have liked at least more freedom in the way of weapon carrying capacity. In a similar vein, Hijacking units is very fun and actually very useful, but would be much deeper if there was a way for players to instruct the hijacked to pick up weapons, or allow them to get kitted out via the relay beacons, even if that weapons the weapon is lost when the hibjacked is freed or dead. Again within the same vein : I found that enemies not using sniper rifles was actually kind of a swing and miss : the sniper rifle handling would work Very well with a computer, since aiming is both visible to the player, and gives enough time for them to either duck for cover or run and gun the sniper. Still the possibility of having a sniper nest as an obstacles would make for a nice amount of challenge and a change of pace.  As mentionned above, I found 4 zones to be too short, even if all 4 zones were handcrafted and the systems associated with each spots were very well made indeed. The fact of the matter is, this layout wont change, which mean you atleast need a certain number to limit repetition. As an alternative, releasing a map editor and letting players create their zones might yield interesting results (even if I have no doubt it'll take a year or so for someone to make as detailed a map as the ones ingame. Ultimately, I hope the team pursues development, having additional zones available (through DLC or expansion, or via a map editor).  It's not Syndicate (Syndicate was a lot more straightforward and simple), rather it's closer to Commando, but it's pretty much the same lore and the same gameplay architecture, with a more complex and tactical system.  Do I recommend it ? Hell yeah ! The game stands on it's own, and it's a genre you simply Dont see done so often anymore.",

By the time I started playing, it ran smooth and I didn't encounter any problems in my first 40 hour playthrough (maybe some of that was idling time).  I found it to be smooth and polished. I enjoyed the cyber-noire story and it was worth finding all the terminals to make sure that all of the narative was revealed (I did use some maps I found online for this, as well as the Steam achievemnents list so that I would know when I found all the terminals in a given zone).  There are lots of valid aproaches to playing. You can go loud and shoot everything up, or use brain-jacked agents to open all the doors as you speed-run through, or take your time and stealth everything. You can even stealth the final boss fight if you have the patience for it.  Now that the coop beta is out, I expect to give this a lot of replay. I have a few friends in different time zones that I think will play, and each group can keep its own persistant multiplayer save.

It's a blast. I think I got this on sale for 15 bucks and it was worth every penny, if not more. I have some thoughts on the ending and the future of this game at the end of this review.  Graphics: Gorgeeous, gritty cyber-punk, it's always night time and it's almost always raining. I wished for more camera control. The Unity engine it was built on did an impressive job. Gameplay: This is a real-time strategy squad control game. If you're familiar with Syndicate and Syndicate Wars, then you know these games can be frustrating. Controlling 4 agents in a fast-paced gunfight is not easy. You won't regret taking the Team Stims skill early on. This allows you to slow down time so you can make good tactical decisions when ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan. Speaking of which, the game is very 'sandbox', -you can take a stealthy approach or go in guns-a-blazin', and there's no penalty for mindlessly slaughtering every thing in your path, including innocent civilians. Make no mistake, this game does not punish you (unlike Deus Ex) for killing innocents. So go ahead and enjoy some collateral damage. I felt free to take on any mission I wanted at any time, in any order. I could start a gun fight anywhere for no reason at all, rob a bank, or do missions to collect blueprints, prototypes and research upgrades for my agents.  Sound: I have nothing to say here, except it's good.  Music: The music in this game is awesome. The 'battle song' never got old, kicking into a solid beat when bullets start flying.  Story: The 'back story' if you can call it that, comes through when you hack data terminals. It's easy to miss, but you get copies of emails that you can read. Through these various emails, a rather intricate plot starts to unravel between the 3 rival corporations (The Eternals, UzyKorp, and Dracogenics). I feel like the devs, who built this game un roughly half a million USD (an impressive feat TBH), had to cut a plot-driven ending and gave us something else entirely. I liked it, but it might not impress everyone.   tldr;  If you like cyberpunk, GTA-style freedom, Syndicate, Syndicate Wars, buy this game.   Personal note for 5 Lives Studios: I LOVE this game. But I also see soooo much potential here for more. The story revealed through hacked emails didn't translate in the gameplay and I'm wondering if there's opportunity here for a sequel. There' a ton of mod potential here too, and I missed that. Custom cities, models, missions, weapons and augs would add a lot of replay value. I would totally throw down for another kickstarter.",

We were promised an open world Syndicate style game. However, the ‘open world’ serves little to no purpose.  You can find ATMs to hack, and erm… that’s all there is to it. That ain’t no sandbox; there’s nothing to do except the missions!  Almost all missions lead you to a compound, containing a door you have to reach. Whatever the mission objective states, it always comes down to breaching the defenses and reaching the door.  Like I say – very hollow.  Don’t get me wrong it feels like a solid base on which to build, but by golly it needs some ‘building’ of the world outside of the copy+paste compound missions.

Stealthy approach is feels like commandos and combat feels like cannon fodder. Enemies don't react to dead bodies or explosions only when you are nearby. They should increase security permanently and leave stationary guards when incidents occurred. In general its not very challenging for experienced player.

First off, the bad.  * The game plays fine for the first 15 to 16 hours, but after that mark, bugs begin appearing in mass, most of which effect gameplay in frustrating ways. Pausing respawning all enemies in the world, for example. Soldiers aiming in a completely different direction than their indended target. Soldiers refusing to move or shoot, and getting stuck in place or in terrain.  * The game has a poor progression system - that is, linear. There is no reason to use Plasma over Laser based weaponry, for example, when both are unlocked so close to one another. The game pauses during inactivity, which hinders the research function whenever you are waiting before infiltrating an enemy region.  * The story is next-to non-existent, as is the environmental interaction.  * There are traces of unfinished features all over the game, leaving a feeling of yearning for what could have been. Vehicles are present, but pose no threat and serve no purpose.  * The relay system should have been either removed or toned down drastically. * While there are plenty of hotkeys, some of the more trivial tasks that one must always do in momments of fast-paced high-risk action seem to have been overlooked. * Certain graphics settings have either no effect on the visuals or frame-rate, even when disabled.  * Lack of narrative progression after tutorial and before the final 'boss.' * Lack of enemy variety. * Enemies do not use many tactics, and are keen to sit and shoot until killed.  Now, the good. * Exceptionally long game. Each area takes roughly 10 hours to complete on a speed run. * Customizable difficulty. This makes the stealth-play far more important, and removes the triviality of death. * Good setting, but not fleshed out due to lack of interaction with it and the limited civilian life. There are also no indoor areas. * Has potential for modding. * Better than Syndicate, this game's predecessor. * Excellent character growth; difference between beginning characters' weakness and ending characters' strength is outstanding. Blowing up even the hardest, largest enemies in mere seconds in amazing.  Overall, I give the game a 4/10.

I don't have the time to invest in games that are not user-friendly.   I don't mean easy, I mean intuitive and clear.  Danger signs were there when the tutorial wanted me to draw a weapon. I did, but it kept asking me to draw my gun like an inverted ED-209.

The tutorial didn't recognise the guard was dead (I was still being asked to draw my weapon). The exit was locked. A pop up making some quasi-sarcastic comment about this was covered by another pop up asking me to draw my gun.  So, unable to get through the door and unsure of how to even get through the tutorial, I quit and wrote this.  Sure, this is almost likely my fault as I am sure I did something wrong.

            "review_text": "Okay, so let's talk.  I liked Syndicate, and this game inspires a lot of the same feelings. Love the modern, lush depiction of what once was a sterile, dystopian society writ in abstract by the limits of graphical fidelity. I enjoy that they've tried to keep a significant portion of the game's variety of approach. I liked the small unit tactics, of the original, but most especially liked that you could complete most (indeed, eventually almost all) missions with the application of stupid amounts of boom.  But that was then, and this is now. So let's talk about how the game plays, right?  Pathfinding? Yeah, it's there, but it's not 100%. You'll have agents (as I just did, yet  again ) who fail to pathfind around the end of a chainlink fence, and instead end up dancing a pathfinding failure as they're gunned down in realtime, with you more or less helpless until you notice that they're spazzing instead of fighting back.  Skill and character customization? Yeah, it's there, and the game adds its own wrinkle of sorts in the form of variable clone stats that you can take advantage of. It's not a major feature, but it adds a little edge. Of course, the developers fail to telegraph how certain design choices will play out vis-a-vis the support character - the lynchpin of the entire game and squad (but don't sprint).   The decision to opt for a triggered ability instead of a tactical pause sounds good, at first - it did to me too, and then you add cover for a more tactical game? Hell, the original Syndicate never had cover, so how could they get it wrong?   Well.. this is where the train starts to leave the tracks.  See, in the original Syndicate, you could mod your agents hormonal levels, in order to 'boost them' later by 'nerfing them' early on. Effectively, you'd turn down an agent's adrenal response until you needed them to really kick it out, and then you'd light the whole system all the way to maximum, and in this way, you could make your agents superhuman when you needed it, and drop back to subnormal when you don't.  Satellite Reign has opted to take this, and combine it with the design vision involving a total lack of a tactical pause, to create a realtime game where the enemies use cover effectively, and think 'independently', but you're expected to respond to this, in realtime, for four agents, who more or less don't think or act unless you explicitly tell them to, and that's bad, in realtime, if kill times get too short.  So why the big deal about a pause?  Well, the original Syndicate also had a PAUSE KEY. Don't take my word for it. It's in the flippin' manual, fer cryin' out loud! This allows the player to compensate for a general lack of 'I don't have eight hands or four separate brains to control every fine aspect of four avatars in realtime'.  Satellite Reign doesn't have one. It sounds good at first, but you quickly become reliant on the support class's stims to be able to manage the game's complexity and keep the clusterf----s controllable. See, your agents are stupid - they dont' take ANY actiosn you don't tell them to take. No AI. No taking cover. No firing back, no moving to a better location if LOS is blocked and they're shooting a lamp post or wall instead of a soft target.  That's bad alone, but then you add in the game's simply enormous emphasis on stealth play and cover, and suddenly you're playing as the only brain in a four-man squad in a tactical game with stealth elements and cover in realtime, everytime your stims are down, with agent avatars that have no volition. You're running an entire puppet troupe by yourself.  Oh - and you can't let the guy with the stims sprint, or he can't stim the group, because the devs have made the decision to totally constipate the class by using the same energy pool for sprinting as for stims - and so intead of being a feature of the player's control (as it is for a tactical pause, or even allowing the *PLAYER* to stim the group on a cooldown/timer) it's instead an unwanted bit-and-harness on the support class - if he's not hidden away, all your fights WILL happen around him, because he can't move away and disengage reliably at all while also permitting you to act like a controller for the agents.  ....and that's about where it falls flat, for me. Syndicate had a pause  for a reason  - controlling four units in tight micro, while also monitoring various abilities and trying to monitor the minimap begins to border on the nutbar level of 'things to monitor at once'. Something will give, and for me, that's my patience with this game.  Stims aren't pause, guys - and the game hurts for it. I'm sorry, you can claim 'vision' but that doesn't polish a bad decision, and it cores out a game that otherwise feels like it will be fairly solid shortly (once the rough edges get a bit of a sanding). Maybe they'll relent or the modders will save them from their arrogance, but I'm not going to recommend a game I cannot enjoy, and this was definitely one of those.  6/10, would only recommend for people with a deep seated need to hone their RTS micro, and not to fans of Syndicate. More style than substance, and several design decisions and buggy implementations mar what should otherwise have been a fantastic reboot and retelling of the Syndicate theme and tone.

USER INTERFACE 1 - you can't alt-tab out to the desktop with out the app forcing its way back to focus 2 - loading screens are pointless 'loading....' then 'establishing satellite connection....' it takes so long to load and my rig is able to run this thing on ultra in full HD with no problems 3 - in the R&amp;D screen, click the plus to add more scientists, the scrollbar always scrolls back to the top, unless you click a different item and click back 4 - get some glitches with the mouse refusing to leave the bottom 5% of the screen unless I click the mouse buttons 5 - cannot change to a screen res other than desktop res. 6 - cannot rotate screen - this is just ludicrous, instead the camera spins round of its own accord. Blowing trying to gather any tactical advantage   GAME PLAY 1 - the AI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, it's so easy to pop around a corner and they won't bother looking, they'll often get stuck in places (the pathfinding is terrible - more on that in a moment) 2 - pathfinding it terrible, agents will often get stuck behind things such as barriers, signs 3 - number of times agents refus to carry out orders, I click to enter a door, they stand still and get killed; tried clicking and moving away but they refuse to obey - looks like the queing system for commands is flawed 4 - restarted a game after destroying camers in the military zone, lo-and-behold all the cameras are back - there is no continuity to destroyed objects. Pretty lame for a game these days 5 - agents will often refuse movement commands and stand around getting killed (very annoying!) 6 - random attacks by NPC security staff even though my threat indicator reads 0, and weapons are holstered 7 - bug in throwing grenades, character will attempt to get in range but usually just approachs the target zone and doesn nothing else 8 - cannot reliably click the grenade icon above an agent - what normally happens is the target marker appears then vanishes. Pressing 'G' is the only reliable method 9 - its way too easy - pretty much any mission can be done by hijacking a security agent, get him to walk around the base, destroy all cameras then you infiltrate. The death penalty needs to be much greater than a few credits and maybe loss of XP - MAJOR ISSUE that will impact re-playability 10 - FAR FAR FAR FAR too easy",

            "review_text": "Tries very much to recreate syndicate, but it's just not as good. Game is slow, saving/loading resets position, restricted areas without saving are very large, sniping rifles don't have reasonable range, leveling up takes ages which limits abilities, guards either spot you from far away or are happy to walk over dead bodies and not care.  I got bored while still in downtown and getting killed multiple times in a row going for one objective. After playing for a while, I still don't understand what cloning does or how it works.",

            "review_text": "I really really wanted to like this game, but imo it is too broken to be enjoyable. I love cyberpunk, and though I found the couple Shadowrun reboots to be somewhat pleasant, they are too linear for my taste. I was hoping for something more open world, like Satellite Reign. Unfortunately this game is plagued by poor performance, long load screens, and it's just buggy where my characters keep getting stuck in walls. Nothing sucks worse than being halfway through a mission only to have one of my characters get stuck in walls, and then I need to reload the mission again and pray that no one gets trapped in a wall again. Add to it that there is a lot of the game that just isn't very intuitive and gets a half-there tutorial.  tl;dr, I could live with the other little issues, but my characters have gotten stuck enough times where i'm ready to rage quit each time it happens (ie. no longer fun).",
