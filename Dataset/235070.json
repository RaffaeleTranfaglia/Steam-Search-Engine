            "review_text": "An extremely shallow, poorly balanced action game with good controls.  PROS: -Clean controls -Variety of weapon types  NEUTRALS: -Storytelling scenes were fair. -Level design is bland.   CONS: -Combat mechanics are awful. Since the enemy hits you almost instantly, the *vast* majority of combat is just trading hits with the enemy. Note: due to poor combat mechanics, you *have* to just trade hits with the enemy until they die a lot of the time. -Balance is awful. You take 1 damage from environmental effects and 1-2 from enemies. Health packs which are EXTREMELY abundant provide 20 health so you never have an issue with health. However, near the very end of the game there is a 'quarantine' room (see below) which throws way too many melee enemies that simply chain-stun you to death. Until this point in the game I did not even come close to dying (except on one boss where you just trade blows as usual). However, I was unable to get past this room despite several attempts since the mobs just chain-stun you and there is nothing you can do. -'Quarantine' rooms: These are rooms that lock the doors on you and continuously spawn enemies at you until you kill them all. The concept is fine, but the problem is that there are way too many enemies spawning in each room, they spawn one by one, and there are way too many of these quarantine rooms back to back to back. Most of the time, you just sit in the corner holding the mouse button down....you could do it with your eyes closed. Its more a test of patience than anything else. -For a game with a metroidvania-esque map, there are no real collectibles, secret areas, etc. ",

            "review_text": "(Text taken from a much larger review I wrote for Operation Rainfall)   Bad Bots is a retro side-scrolling shooter for the PC and Mac (and mobile devices at an undetermined date). The story of the game revolves around Sam McRae as he wakes up from his hypersleep while traveling on the Titan Hauler. Once awake, Sam finds himself in all sorts of trouble. For starters, the Titan Hauler is on a crash course with Earth. As if that’s not bad enough, the ship’s robotic crew have been reprogrammed and now want to destroy all humans. This is not good since Sam happens to be a human. Poor guy.  While the game does have you mainly on a straightforward path, I never felt hindered by this. This is not like a JRPG where you have towns to explore and vast lands that hold untold fortunes. You accept at the beginning of the game that you are stuck on this ship and that there are not going to be a lot of places to explore. While for the most part you will be going left or right from room to room, near the end of the game you will need to backtrack a bit to reenter rooms you were previously in. I never really found myself too lost during this time, but you will need to wander around the ship until you find what you are looking for.  Bad Bots visually looks like exactly what it is, a side-scrolling game with a retro throwback. The game features a retro-style that does not entertain the notion of being a graphical powerhouse. The Titan Hauler is in bad shape and features broken bits here and there that reflect what the ship has been through. The robots each have a distinct look that is simple yet pleasing to look at. The first robots you get to kill are mostly red and are holding a knife: which they seem to take pleasure in shanking you with! These robots, once they notice you, will bee-line right for you with their knife slashing as if they are ready to take you on even from afar. The robots with guns begin shooting once they see you. If they are on a walkway that is above you and made of metal, the bullets cannot reach you and you will have a few seconds to swap your weapon, look for health or just examine the room. Other enemies include electrified spiders which run at full pace right at you to zap the life out of Sam.  The pros of this game far outweigh the cons. Even if such things as no background music and lack of a stellar story annoy you, the game is still worth a purchase, if only to shoot at some robots! I would recommend the game to anyone and will probably be killing robots for the foreseeable future in the challenge modes.",
