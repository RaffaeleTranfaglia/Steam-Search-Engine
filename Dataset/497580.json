            "review_text": "I've played all the Artifex Mundi games on Steam so far, I've enjoyed most of them but this one was just not good at all. Story was boring and didnt make much sense, it seemed like it was missing a lot of background information or just information in general. Compared to the other games this one also seemed pretty short (and yet somehow drawn out) and didnt even have a little extra unlocked episode after completing the main story like most of the games have. I'm a big fan of these games but this one was a big dissapointment and frankly a waste of money even at the 40% off sale price I paid. If youre gonna try one of these games out try the enigmatis series (my personal fave) or a fairy tale one instead. Hopefully Artifex Mundi's next game is much better than this one.",
