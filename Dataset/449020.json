    "description": "In The Bottom of the Well, you play as Alice who has just had an unsettingly life-like dream about the end of the world. She retells her experience to her friend in a huge, branching narrative. Although a single play-through might take as little as 20 minutes, experiencing all the possible paths Alice can take through the ruins of her...",

            "review_text": "It's free, and that's the first thing you need to know, but the second is that this is a genuine bit of writing-driven hypnotic cleverness. The music and art are both on point, and the story is so profoundly aware of itself that all its gameified elements backfeed into the plot, get shout-outs in the text, and and genuinely lift this kind of storytelling above the static, linear progression you'd see in a really good novel.  Bottom of the Well is a choose-your-own-adventure in the old Joe Denver's Lone Wolf sense, with stats and equipment and companions all tracked. It's also one in which decision-making is guided primarily by your stats, and secondarily by common sense. I built a hulking musclebeast of an Alice and sent it rampaging through the nuclear wasteland, tanking incredible amounts of radiation and going head-on with every encounter it met. It survived, but learned nothing about the circular dream it was trapped in, and eventually it comitted suicide of its own will to reset the scenario.  By the way: this game is chilling. It's not exceptionally dark, but every little bit of inhumanity in it is very nuanced by the characters and tone, and all of them *hurt* just a little to read. If you're looking for something happy to play, this is not that. If you're looking for the kind of story that you routinely survive, this is not that either.   There's a hidden ending in this game, by the way. A final rabbithole to descend, although I haven't found it in my hour-and-change of getting bombed and then dying. I haven't seen any walkthroughs of it online, so for the time being it is still a special thing; a hidden thing. A bit of narrative that you could find that few other people have seen.  Anyway Red Nettle, the studio that produced this, has created something fey and unsettling. Here's hoping that they can follow it up with something just as clever.",

            "review_text": "“I wonder if I've been changed in the night. Let me think. Was I the same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a little different. But if I'm not the same, the next question is 'Who in the world am I?' Ah, that's the great puzzle!”  ― Lewis Carroll, Alice in Wonderland  The game is presented as a dialogue between the main heroine, Alice, and her friend, M. Hatter. Alice is presented as a narrator of the story(stories), while M. Hatter comments on some particular events which happen to Alice in her lucid, life-like dreams. In each dream Alice is different. She is shaped by the statistics you are able to customize (and by the decisions you make during your walkthrough). The game presents you with an opportunity to choose a preset Alice (default or 'dark Alice',which even has her own art). The dialogue and the beginning of the game differ depending on the stats you choose.  At first you might think that the game is about plain survival, That's definitely not the case here. Of course, you are able to play this way, making choices according to your outlook. However, the 'true' ending is hidden accurately, and it will take you a few playthroughs to get to the main idea of the game. And even then there will be unanswered questions left, the answers to which you will have to come up with yourself.   I would definitely recommend giving this game a try.",

However, I played through The Bottom of the Well, not just once but multiple times and I enjoyed every second. All branches of the short but well-written story are intense and interesting, and the music sets the mood just right. The interface is somewhat messy and not very well done, but for this type of game it isn't a huge deal. Great one.",

Thumbs up for the literal effort to make this darkest of the dark horor fantasy ( i dont like horor at all) and for the 'Sin City Frame' for the graphic novel i especially apriciate the fact that the game is totaly free without the lure of microtransactions or paywall setbacks during gameplay. It is actually very interesting but the story is rather depressing and horific and suffers from a light treatment of horrible scenarios which even makes the comic relief chat rabbit's humor distasteful. Of course dark fantasy and SF is hardly successful without these elements-unfortunately. Allthou this game should in no case be taken seriously other than a literal work of art and a good and fun game that really ingages your fantasy and intelect. I especially like that the right choises in this game are visible and kinda sugested and that they are allways the most inteligent and humane choise offered at the same time.   ;-}   ",

While the early stages can get a bit reptative at times the differences in Alice and in the choices you make help to create a great game each time. I would not recommend playing it through a ton of times all at once though for risk of wearing out that early dialogue in particular. Also the game is free so you're not at a loss for trying it.",

            "review_text": "The Bottom of the Well is an awesome choose-your-own-adventure type game with several added mechanics including character stats/archetypes and inventory for more levels of depth. The skip feature was much appreciated , allowing you to get back to potentially disasterous forks in the road to continue your path to the end. I have not achieved the true ending, but the path there has been quite entertaining. The story is a bizarre meta story, with most of the game being framed as the narrator's dream. Beautiful graphics, more than what i expect from these choose-your-own-adventure game, but only 2-3 character models, much fewer than you'd get it a typical anime-themed visual novel (this game is neither of those things). I hope to pick it up again later down the line and maybe give the true ending another shot, as it is I have gone through the game too many times to easily find something new, if you know what i mean. One of the more fun free to play text based experiences ive had in a while, definetley suggest at least a couple playthroughs. 8/10",

The music is also pretty minimal, just one soft piano track, but again, it works very well with the narrative feel. The story is fantastic! It's pretty deep for how quickly you can play through a session, and each choice really makes all the difference, even down to what gear you take or what order you choose to do things. This game has a lot of depth, and the story is surprisingly, yet casually dark. The dialogue feels very natural, like a conversation someone would have over a messenger, so bravo on not making it feel awkward and forced. The endings were... appropriate, for lack of a better word. I died a lot, mostly from radiation. It felt 'real' in the sense that there wasn't really a 'happy ending,' despite what the achievements say. I didn't quite get one of the endings, but maybe it was just because I wasn't paying close enough attention. The only negative thing I can say is that some of the menu things seem a little buggy, including the stats, but it was hardly a detractor.  Definite replayability. The art, the music, the dialogue, the story- this game is great. I honestly can't believe it's free- this is a game worth buying.",

Not being able to get back to the main menu at the middle of a game is a bummer, you have to finish that storyline even though it's certainly not where you want to be going. And sometimes it's almost impossible to see the connection between some stats and the final outcome, or the different options you're presented with. There are also some bugs, nothing too serious IMO.  The music is pretty repetitive but more athmospheric than annoying,   A good way to spend an evening or two. Go for it guys.

In the game you can choose things that determine whether you live or die, and it's not too long of a game to feel very badly about a choice *cough* Until Dawn *cough*  Anyways, the story is well thought out and the diologue is very realistic, especially for how old Alice is for this time period, the makers add a little silly slang and jokes in the mix. And the atmosphere with both the music AND the rad backgrounds that /may/ or may not change based on what you choose, are a nice touch to the scary facts of the story Alice is describing. In awesome detail btw, not too much detail to be annoying and not too flat  The only complaint i have are the little icons at the top of the screen telling you your mood and food supply i presume ??? Well the food cans went from the three i had initially, to four when i found more, and did not decrease when Alice said she ate some. And my mood emoji thingy (?? dunno what to call it ??) did not change at all even when it said i was scared when Alice was talking. Like it even flashed and looked like it changed even though it was still a :) happy face  But overall this game is great for a quick little, mind twisting game. Graphics aren't the best, but they compliment the format and characters of the game nicely enough. Sooo i guess good job guys!! You made a great simple game!",

            "review_text": "A mix of a visual novel and Groundhog Day, this game is about trying new options - and when I say options, I mean more than your dialogue choices. Something new about this particular VN is the ability to customize the protagonist's stats and inventory at the beginning, giving you different options as the story progresses, and affecting the success rate of certain choices.   There are a few bugs, but they aren't game breaking. For example, when equipping inventory, the first item may be visually unresponsive until a second action is done. The game only features about two songs in it's soundtrack, but this is natural for the game's length, and size, as well as price (Free!). It would benefit from a 'Skip Read Text' section, as your starting stats and inventory choices may affect the text sublety, which you may end up skipping entirely, or reading the same text over and over again to find a simple - but possibly vital change in dialogue.",

Also, I would have liked if the 'skip button' would stop, the moment that the player encounters new material in the game. I was rather surprised when the skip button didn't stop at new portions that I had unlocked, and I ended up having to replay things, in order to read the parts that I had missed. I have to say that games made with Ren'Py rather spoiled me, when it comes to that; I was genuinely not prepared for that. But, all that aside, I can say that I genuinely enjoyed the game. I really, truly wish to see more!

Pros:  1) Great storytelling - It's kind of like 'the butterfly effect' meets 'the matrix' - and the immersion and layering is such that it can make you briefly question if the 'real' world is yet another layer in the game 2) Price - what's not to like about a free game? 3) Graphics - yes, it's a text game, but the text looks good, and the artwork is fitting 4) Music - the single track fits the mood well  Cons:  1) The time it takes to reload the game is a bit of a pain, especially since you die so much 2) Only a very small handful of good endings compared to many, many ways to die - one thing I liked about choose your own adventure books is that there were often many 'good' endings 3) Inventory system - I felt like this added extra complexity that made it much harder to explore all the possible paths in the game, which led to excess repetition in gameplay 4) Music - the single track gets repetitive  Overall, I would gladly pay money for a more extensive and more polished version of this.
