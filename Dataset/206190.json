First hour: Whoa, this is a game built on barely-coherent mechanics that would definitely appeal to someone with neurochemistry very different from my own.  Fourth hour: I just rerouted power from a lightswitch into a power socket into an elevator call button which when activated will knock out a guard patrolling near the elevator which clears the room so when I arrive the sound detector will open a door that contains a guard whose gun is linked to a different gun on a different floor so when the guard fires he'll trigger the other gun which will kill a guard defending a laptop with sensitive data which I can only reach by throwing a different switch and leaping down through a glass ceiling and knocking out the gunman guard before he can reload at which point I bolt through the vault door before it closes.",

            "review_text": "Gunpoint is a stealth puzzle platformer game that is one of my all time favourite indie games. You play as a freelance spy who takes jobs from both sides of the law which usually involve you breaking into high security buildings to steal important information, preferably without being noticed. However you are not a regular spy, equipped with trousers that let you jump inhumanly high and gadgets to outsmart your enemies you're the kind of spy everyone wants to be.  +Great art style +Great level design and gadget design +Unique gameplay, the first gadget you unlock (the Crosslink) allows you to rewire anything electrical so that you can bypass the security measures of the building, trap guards or create new paths to your objective +Interesting story with interesting characters combined with great writing +You get upgrades for your bullfrog trousers which makes them charge faster and jump higher +A number of different gadgets to unlock, each introducing a new gameplay mechanic +Gunpoint has a great editor which allows you to create your own missions and share them through the Steam workshop +The main story takes place over 20 missions and how long each one takes depends on how good you are at the game and the main story is very replayable due to how good the game's mechanics are +If you just want to play the puzzles you can skip all of the story but I'm not sure why you would want to +You can trick guards in to doing all kinds of things, from trapping themselves to killing other guards +Has Steam achievements and Trading Cards  -The story is very short at approximately 3 hours but the game does have a lot of replayability and there is also the editor mode to keep you busy  Verdict: 9.5  An outstandingly good stealth puzzle game that is an absolute steal at its price, a must buy for fans of stealth games and puzzle games alike.

Brief but often dense building-infiltration missions are punctuated by well-written and often funny dialogue sequences, and upgrades increase the number of ways you can approach situations. It feels like a more stealth-based, zoomed-out, 2D version of infiltrating an open-ended area in the original Deus Ex, in that the level has a goal, but it's set up as a playground to allow you to explore your abilities and exploit opportunistic, er, opportunities.   It doesn't take long to get through this, but I enjoyed every moment of it, and some significant branching decision points in the game and in the dialogue make me wonder how things would change around in a second play.",

            "review_text": "Gunpoint’s a clever game. It’s clever in all the ways you’d expect a good game to be, of course; It’s got a distinctive art style and soundtrack that effectively create the feeling of a noir-inspired, near future world. It’s also got a nicely refined difficulty and progression curve, holding your hand and building your strength without insulting you. There’s a bunch of other core gameplay elements Gunpoint does well – yet it is not really these that which make it so clever.  The first thing that really does this, and which catapults the game into being something more special, come in the form of its core gameplay feature - the Crosslink. In short, it’s a device that lets you rewire one device to another, changing the way they operate. This can be simple as wiring up a switch to open up a door instead of turning on a light... Or it can be as complicated as using a lift to trigger a sound sensor, which in turn turns off a light, causing a curious guard to wander over to the lightswitch, which electrocutes a socket elsewhere when flipped, which in turn knocks out another guard. It sounds confusing, but it’s surprisingly intuitive and easy to get used to; it’s not long before you’ll start to feel like a real Crosslink expert.   This is clever in itself, but the real brilliance comes from the fact that’s there’s no real negative result to messing around with this power that brings your fun coming to a screeching standstill. Either your elaborate Crosslink scheme succeeds, making you feel like a diabolical mastermind, or it ends up falling apart, at which point you’re just eager to refine your strategy and work out what went wrong instead of being infuriated. There’s always the third result that your plan was so stupid that it ends up with a door swinging open and knocking you flying, you won’t care regardless, because that’s just hilarious.   Another way the game’s quite ingenious is that you’re free to play it however you want. Want to buy a gun and just shoot every problem you face? You can do that. Want to use your super jump to arc gracefully through the air and silently smash through a window like a twisted, trench coat wearing Spiderman? Go ahead! It’s possible for every player to have a different experience on a level just because of all the different ways you can approach each situation. I myself went for a no-upgrade run on my second playthrough, which presents its own challenges and its own little moments. The game itself even subtly reacts to your play style – there’s a nice easter egg for if you get too punch happy on a guard, and the story and future missions can even subtly change based on how you’ve played previously. Smart! Again.   This ability to choose you own play style even leaks into the story – while your choices here don’t affect things that much, you can still choose to respond to your client’s calls deadly seriously, or just make endless deadpan comments and jokes about the absurdity of the situation. The writing’s witty and genuinely funny at points, and while the story itself got a little overly complicated for my tiny brain to comprehend as it neared its end, in general it’s compelling and has a nice few twists and turns that keep things moving well. It’s all... Well, I think you can guess what I’m going to say.  Overall, it’s hard to fault Gunpoint. There’s possibly an argument to be made that it’s a little short, but as noted above, there’s tons of replay value that comes in changing your technique, and the fact you can build your own levels is just more reason to keep playing. Overall, this is a smart and entertaining title that’s certainly worthy of your time.  ",

Most games don't have your character glibly text his contacts the bracketed notes you assume are for your own benefit.  The puzzles are engaging, tricky, and combat is hilariously satisfying. The game is somewhat dynamic and you can play for most sides like any true espionage agent. You can play like a consumate professional, or you can be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with spring-loaded pants and an itchy punching fist.  The only real downside is that in the end, it all boils down to a single ending. It's an ending you can handle several different ways, but it's the same one, really.  Protip: Don't get too fancy when you clear the final level for the first time, save whatever battery you have, because whatever you have at the end is how much battery you have for any post-game easter egg hunting you might want to do.

The way you can configure devices to work with eachother, such as wiring a lightswitch to a door or unwiring a security camera from an alarm over to a socket which you can immediately overcharge to shock and incapacitate any nearby guards, provides for solid core gameplay and ample room for whatever wiring ingenuity and/or shenanigans the player can come up with using the game's simple and easy to utilize hacking interface. The puzzles further on become more complex featuring different sets of circuitry, sound-sensitive alarms, motion sensors, etc. Late game, you can even wire switches to guns so you can manipulate the guards into shooting eachother!  There's also elements of stealth gameplay, generally staying out of the sight of guards whom fire with frightening accuracy as well as sneaking through enemy-riddles corridors with good timing and carefully avoiding generally making too much noise, y'know, the usual stuff. While the game does reward you for playing stealthily with higher grades, it's not required to score well or progress. You can play this game like a complete jackass, with the aid of your trusty mail-order superpants which allow you to make stupidly high jumps, pounces, and slides.  Its absolute weakest point is that the game is rather unfortunately short. Even for stealth-impaired players such as myself, it took me about 3 hours to clear and collect all optional goals such as the laptops scattered throughout all the levels. I haven't gotten an A+ on every level or unlocked every achievement yet, so there's a bit of replay value there that I'm sure I'll get a couple more hours out of. Furthermore, every copy of the game comes with a level editor, so I'm sure there will be user-generated levels of reasonable quality soon if you haven't gotten your fix from the main storyline. (Steam Workshop integration would have been great for this!)  I can recommend this game to those seeking a new puzzle/action experience with fun, simple, and solid gameplay mechanics that you can enjoy over the course of an afternoon. For those looking to maximise their gameplay/dollar ratio, you may want to wait for this one to go on sale or find its way in a Humble Bundle. Either way, it's a solid first game from Tom Francis and the folks at Suspicious Developments. The spy film noir style soundtrack is also rather catchy.",

            "review_text": "An absolutely neat little game whose gameplay focuses heavily around puzzles involving hacking into buildings and rewiring their electrical systems. The way you can configure devices to work with eachother, such as wiring a lightswitch to a door or unwiring a security camera from an alarm over to a socket which you can immediately overcharge to shock and incapacitate any nearby guards, provides for solid core gameplay and ample room for whatever wiring ingenuity and/or shenanigans the player can come up with using the game's simple and easy to utilize hacking interface. The puzzles further on become more complex featuring different sets of circuitry, sound-sensitive alarms, motion sensors, etc. Late game, you can even wire switches to guns so you can manipulate the guards into shooting eachother!  There's also elements of stealth gameplay, generally staying out of the sight of guards whom fire with frightening accuracy as well as sneaking through enemy-riddles corridors with good timing and carefully avoiding generally making too much noise, y'know, the usual stuff. While the game does reward you for playing stealthily with higher grades, it's not required to score well or progress. You can play this game like a complete jackass, with the aid of your trusty mail-order superpants which allow you to make stupidly high jumps, pounces, and slides.  Its absolute weakest point is that the game is rather unfortunately short. Even for stealth-impaired players such as myself, it took me about 3 hours to clear and collect all optional goals such as the laptops scattered throughout all the levels. I haven't gotten an A+ on every level or unlocked every achievement yet, so there's a bit of replay value there that I'm sure I'll get a couple more hours out of. Furthermore, every copy of the game comes with a level editor, so I'm sure there will be user-generated levels of reasonable quality soon if you haven't gotten your fix from the main storyline. (Steam Workshop integration would have been great for this!)  I can recommend this game to those seeking a new puzzle/action experience with fun, simple, and solid gameplay mechanics that you can enjoy over the course of an afternoon. For those looking to maximise their gameplay/dollar ratio, you may want to wait for this one to go on sale or find its way in a Humble Bundle. Either way, it's a solid first game from Tom Francis and the folks at Suspicious Developments. The spy film noir style soundtrack is also rather catchy.",

And I've played quite a few, and found the stealth sections to be boring and annoying. The soundtrack probably brings some of those feelings. The soundtrack is fantastic, albeit short, and every track is a joy to listen to. If you want a small dose of the music, I'd recommend listening to the trailer. The storyline is lacking, but I wouldn't consider that to be something that makes it a terrible game. In fact, even without a storyline, this game still shines. The storyline does what it should do, however. It gives you an objective. A villain, per-se. And that's all you really need. Last of all, the gameplay is what brings it all together. Early in the game, you are given the ability to 'jump'. It's exactly what you think. You can do whatever you want with it, though. Climb on walls, hang on ceilings, etc. All the while, being extremely unrealistic and silly. The other main mechanic, the rewiring of electricity, is a joy. For any puzzle game enthusiasts, this part of the game is for you. However, don't expect any puzzles to be too complex. There are multiple ways to reach your endgoal. And all of them are fun.

The dialogue is hilarious and the story will carry you through its twists and turns as you try to find the real killer.  The main story can be played through in four to five hours, but with multiple endings and playstyles you will likely want to re-play at least once. The difficulty level is never high.  One technical note is that playing on a trackpad is doable--I finished the game that way--but frustrating at times. It's definitely better to play with a mouse.

So if the guard walks through the gate he can fall to his death. Also wires have different colors so you will have to work your way through to activate different color wires, before reaching end. All that while you can hang to the ceiling and jump super high and far, game also has abbilities tree to upgrade those and many more abbilities.

That said, I think playing it is worth the experience so I do recommend checking it out.  After playing the demo a year or two ago I was under the impression that this was some sort of stealth or action game but that is certainly not the case. Rather, Gunpoint is a puzzle game which largely revolves around adjusting activators to accomlish your goal (get further into the stage by opening doors/killing guards). There aren't a whole lot of sensor types -- guard activated panels, sound activated devices, elevator switches, normal on/off switches and motion detectors -- and that kind of drags the game down a touch. While the different combinations could have possibly been explored more within the story the game also felt somewhat lacking, like you spent too much time/too many stages figuring out the same or similar tricks.  There is a level editor for what it's worth and while that's cool I think I would have liked to see an additional story arc or two within the main game, possibly centering around different events or characters.  I very much enjoyed the sound track but there are only a few different tracks. Still, the haunting melody suits the noire atmosphere well.  Oh, and there's a story but it feels like an after thought. The plot is alright-ish but the writing itself isn't strong. At several points I caught some small grammatical errors. Beyond that the dialogue tree felt largely unnecessary and at times it didn't seem like my choices made a difference in what the other character responded with. I don't mind the writing so much but the game felt like it was relying on the story for it's missions.  On the other hand end-game moral choices can ♥♥♥♥ off. If you intend to 100% this game then back up your save before you make the final moral choice so that you don't have to replay the whole thing to do it. Having said that, I have 4.2 hours logged and could almost certainly clear the game again in about two hours. It's very, very short.  Check it out though. It's cute, short and original.",

After acquiring magic pants, your Private Eye can now leap great heights with ease. Crashing through windows, latrching to walls and ceilings, this is how you'll get through a level most of the time. Each of the levels is laid out as a 2D cut-away view of a building. Your missions generally include collecting intel, reaching a well-guarded corporate suit, etc.  How you'll do it is via a combination of two prominent skills; stealth, and hacking. You'll leap into shadows, crawl up walls, creep up behind guards to take them out. But how to you get past a locked door? That's where the hacking comes in. Early on, you obtain the ability to change view and reroute the circuits within the building. These are mostly changing the outputs of switches/sensors, but they can be combined in hilariously complex ways.  One such example is rewiring a camera sensor to turn off the lights instead of raising an alarm. The confused guards will walk to the light switch to turn it back on, only to find they've turned the lights off on another floor, where I'm waiting to take out the guard in total darkness.  It's really rewarding when your plan works, and due to the many number of ways to approach a situation, it feels like your own triumph.  The sarcastic-noir feel is great, which continues in-between missions. Your dialogue choices allow you be either be a straight-cut spy, or a self-aware nut-job. I went, of course, the sarcastic route.  A great game, albeit short. Although you can create your own levels, and download others, so there is a replayability factor.",

In Gunpoint, you have choice about who to work for, how to achieve your objectives, and how much to cooperate with your clients.  In terms of game mechanics, there may be multiple ways to approach any given mission, and various levels of success in completing your objectives (were you a 'ghost', never being detected, or did you have to knock a couple of guards out, or worse?)—this game certainly has replay value (I'll probably replay it at least once).  At the end of a play-through, you get to sum up your feelings in a 'blog post' that generates an actual web page—a pretty cool way to contextuilze your experience, as well as promoting it to your friends.

            "review_text": "2D Watch_Dogs  Gunpoint  Gunpoint is one of the most rewarding and exciting games I have played in quite awhile. The game has beautiful pixel art, well done background music, and challenging puzzles.  Presentation:  In Gunpoint, you play the role of a freelance detective/secret agent. This means you take the jobs YOU want and get paid accordingly. Because of this, you can beat the game and never see some levels! Also, this concecpt is introduced in a really unique way. Everything is done over texts, and you choose how to communicate. You can lie, tell the truth, or cover up your tracks. The game also has a suprisingly good story. The writing is clever, and well done. 9/10  Sound:  Gunpoint has great music that I was happy to hear. The music matches the game's tone and feel and really complements it. Unfortunately, if I ever got stuck on a stage, the music did get a little repititious. The sound effects in the game are perfect and feel perfect. 7/10  Graphics:  The graphics is perfectly done pixel art. Nuf said. 10/10  Gameplay:  This is where Gunpoint shines. The actual gameplay is Gunpoint is absolutely amazing! I had genuine fun all through the game (excpept for a bug at the end which made me have to restart the level multiple times) even when I lost. The goal of the game is usually to either grab some prototype weapon or hack a computer then leave. How you do that, can be achieved in multiple ways. You could be a merciless killer and destroy everyone in your path, or you could flip lights off and sneak through the given building. A major point that I must mention on hacking. The hacking (or better called as in the game 'rewiring') can be confusing at first but gets really cool. You can rewire a light switch so when the switch is hit, a trap door opens that sends a guard to his doom, for example. With all these great gameplay elements, I have little complaints with Gunpoint. The one knockoff, however, is how short the game is. The only reason I am not slamming Gunpoint for the short campaign is because there are levels I haven't even played because of my desicions. So I am just gonna replay the game! 10/10  Lasting Appeal:  As stated above, the campaign is great, but short lived. The game does come with a level editor, but it feels somewhat limited. The level editor is great, don't get me wrong, but it is simply not the focus of the game. 8/10  Verdict: Gunpoint is an amazing stealth adventure game that sadly ends way too early.  + Great Story - Short lived fun + Fun Gameplay - Simple level editor + Spectacular audio and visuals  I hope this review helps :D",

You play a spy-for-hire who unwittingly gets caught up in a murder and gets involved in missions from various people in an attempt to find the true killer. It's a bit of a stealth puzzle game with each level being a building that you have to work your way through to reach your goal. To do this involves making your character jump crazy heights with his jumping device which he just happens to have for some reason. You can also use a device that allows you to rewire different switches and sensor to activate doors and devices throughout the building which is the games most interesting mechanic.   The Good: - It's an easy game to pick up the basics but still manages to provide a decent challenge in later levels when you have to figure out your way through each building. - I loved the humour of this game and it did genuinely make me laugh a few times. It doesn't take itself seriously which is reflected in your characters interactions with his employers (which you can dictate) and it add's to the games charm. - Being able to hack and rewire each buildings circuitry to your advantage is really enjoyable as it gives you several options on how to proceed as well as being able to lay traps for the guards.   The Bad: - It's a pretty short game and i did feel like i wanted more at the end. It does have replay value as you can make different choices during the conversation sequences.  - The levels do get a bit repetetive in later parts of the game as there isn't much new mechanics introduced to change things up a bit.   To summarize this is a game thats worth a try. It manages to be fun and enjoyable if a little too short. 7/10",

Moving on from that quite long side-note, Gunpoint is a fun and at times challenging (but not frustrating) game that, while short in length, has a neat little story... probably. I don't know.

            "review_text": "I'm really starting to dig noir stuff now. Why? Because of Gunpoint.  Gunpoint is a 2d sidescrolling stealth game that let's you play as a freelance spy who'll accept any contract as long as he get's his payday, and you can approach each mission however you want. Want to be a pacifist? you can do it, you want to do it like a Ninja? You can do it, or do you want to be an absolute psychopath and shoot or punch your way through everyone? Well you're in luck, you can do that too.  Story: You play as Richard Conway, who one night falls into a window from another building. A murder ensues and you get involved into corporate espionage between two corporations, Rooke and Intex. From this point on you have control of how the game's narrative goes, due to the multiple dialogue choices you can choose from each conversation with each character that hire's Richard. In this sense, Richard can either be a complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥, a smart person who covers his tracks, a funny but sometimes awkward person you get the idea. The dialouge is really funny and the characters themselves are pretty good and are affected by your decisions. It's actually fun to mess around with these characters and play both sides. All in all it's a choice and consequence game and it's a fun ride that warrants a few playthroughs just to say what results you get.  Gameplay: Gunpoint uses 2d sidescrolling that is mainly focused on utilising stealth. It's challenging because it's very easy to get killed, not to mention that you'll encounter alarms, security cameras, motion detecters and locked doors. Planning on how you'll get in, aquiring the item/data and getting out sucessfully is what you'll be doing each mission, the only difference is the security layout, building size and how many guards are there. You can upgrade how high you jump and how quick you can do it, also you can buy a variety of equipment that makes things easier, like a crosslink for instance.  The Crosslink device that you get early in game, let's you connect security systems into other security systems that enables you to cleverly get around the building. For example, I crosslink a lightswitch to a door, I turn on/off the switch, I can open the door. what's great about this game is not just the choice you have in the narrative, but it's also the choice of how you want to approach missions.  Graphics and Music: I used to dislike retro-inspired graphics, but my viewpoint towards it has been toning down ever since then. I appreciate it more than ever now, and in Gunpoints case, I'm glad the developers went with this direction, because Gunpoint just stands out and has a really cool theme to back it up. Speaking of music, It's Jazz that soothes into your ears, making you feel like you're in a noir-film or a spy movie, it's badass.  Overall: The only disappointing thing I can come up with is that it's too short and I wish it was longer. I was thinking that you could freely take any contract and have mutiple storylines going on. Regardless, Gunpoint is now part of Steam workshop and there are plenty of custom made maps to choose from. For only $10.00 it's a really enjoyable game that has replay value, awesome music, awesome gameplay, funny dialogue and characters.",

The achievements do a very good job of mocking achievement systems, while still being genuinely fun to collect. In all, this is an indie game which feels like it's mocking other games, but doing it in the opposite of how most games do it - it does it by legitimately being good.  It's hard to decide whether I'd call it a platformer or a puzzle game. It's a bit of both, and yet not quite either one, because of the large amount of stealth required. Mainly it revolves around situational rewiring of electrical systems to make them complete tasks for you. And jumping. Through windows.   Anyway, it's really good, and I'm really glad I finished it.

But it's also the perfect game for those who like something straight and to the point. The main draw comes from your ability to rewire different electronic objects in a level from anywhere. For example, you can rig a lightswitch to activate a handprint door downstairs because science. You can also rig a trapdoor to go out under someone when his buddy walks into a motion detector because more science. But not everything can be rigged to other electronic devices because more science so you'll need to gain the access to these electronic devices from a hotlink panel and then you'll have the go of those electronic devices but they'll only work with their own color/shape because other science that can't work with other sciences (science). So activate hotlink panels, fool guards (who shoot on sight, and quickly at that), rewire things and reach your objective.  To make things easier on you, you have Bullfrog jeans that allow you to leap anywhere you so choose at varying speeds, no fall damage either. You also can cling to surfaces you leap at. It's a lot of fun to utilize by itself. The other half of the fun comes with how you choose to complete your objectives.  As interesting as the plot is, the game itself notes that sometimes it just doesn't matter and it lets you do whatever you so wish. Do you want to crush that guy with a door? Go ahead! Do you want to kick another door into some other guy? Knock yourself out! If you want to challenge yourself, there's an option, but it's not required. Ultimately Gunpoint is a game in which you can do whatever the ♥♥♥♥ you want, just complete your objective in anyway you choose and kick down doors because ♥♥♥♥ doors.",

Unlike Watch_Dogs however, the puzzle theme of the hacking aspect actually feels integrally present, and indeed the hacking feels totally necessary. The game is relatively short, but it has a charming graphic style and slick mechanics.  Despite the title, in actuality you only need to shoot one person in the game- the game is rendered such that using a gun (a late-game tool) puts you at a stretch for time. This encourages the player to favour fisticuffs (or total stealth) alongside using the hacking mechanics- you are never able to just blitz through a level. The deadliness of the guards helps retain a true need for stealth. This makes the game more satisfying to beat. Once multiple circuits come into play, the game becomes a lot less straightforward, as one has to decide how to trigger events to incapacitate guards utilising multiple devices. It is exceedingly fun to watch your intricate circuits work to your advantage! In sum, this game is easily my favourite which I possess on Steam. Yes, the game is short, but equally you have a wealth of user content to keep you playing and thinking. I was fortunate enough to get this game on sale.

It is a 2D platformer that adds a lot of great features that make the gameplay easier and more interesting. There are optional challenges during missions that serve to make easy missions harder. There is a great respawn mechanic that allows you to pick up play 2-10 seconds before you died, meaning lots of boring trekking from the last save point is removed. The crosslink system allows you to get through levels in any number of inventive ways, and really makes speedrunning far more creative. The music is, like many indie games, fantastic and very well suited to the game's vibe; I keep listening to it over and over at work (go 'Five Floor Goodbye'!). The gameplay rewards lateral thinking, good planning, and some precise timing. Like many stealth games you can go for every conceivable approach e.g. kill every guard; knock out dangerous guards, touch nobody and leave no trace, etc. This definitely adds to replayability, and allows people to challenge themselves to go all Solid Snake on the guards (I'm afraid there's no cardboard boxes in game). The storyline is very good, you'll find yourself trying to solve the case yourself with the information people give you, you'll find yourself actively wondering whether to trust some people or whether they have their own agendas, you'll find yourself invested in the fates of those people who help you through the game, and you'll find yourself deciding whether to dispense your own justice, or leave it to the state. You'll feel involved in the plot, and will have some satisfaction finishing it off. Definitely a good buy.",

            "review_text": "Gunpoint at its core is a solid game. It has all the foundations in place to make a challenging stealth-action game - but I feel the campaign doesn't make the most of them. There is a lot of fluff content that does not mean anything or do anything tangible at all, and although the game offers 'branching' dialogue choices in the end only one really matters. However, Gunpoint is still fun and I recommend it as a cheap game you could knock off in a day that also happens to have a level editor to keep it interesting.  PROS: *It's fun *Controls are simple and very easy to get used to *There is room for cheekiness and finesse with the controls despite this being a one-shot-you're-dead stealth game *You can skip all dialogue sequences if you want to even without experiencing them at least once *All skill upgrades add variety to the ways you can navigate a level (except deathfluke which is a failsafe) *Skills can be unlocked in whatever order you want (save one) and only 2 are required to beat the game (not counting one that is given to you for free) *The base mechanics and level entities lend themselves very well to challenging level design and could be used to make clever maps *You do not have to replay the game more than once to get all the achievements or perfect rankings - you can freely replay any mission including the opportunity to explore any alternative dialogue options at no penalty *It's reasonably lengthy for a small indie game. Once you've played through the game the first time though it's likely you'll be able to breeze through in less than an hour since you now know how all the levels work *There are no viral achievements or social media tie-in achievements of any description. You can get them all without having to go out of your way to do anything but play the campaign (and fiddle with the level editor once)  MEHS: *The game keeps a total of 3 autosaves a few seconds apart from each other as you're playing. While this is handy if you mess up I can see others branding the feature as 'challenge impairing'. However you can instead decide to restart the mission from scratch if you want *The games sense of humor might grate for some people. I personally thought the 'funny' dialogue choices were a bit ham or dull - with a few exceptions *Mission rankings mean absolutely nothing and have no effect on achievements or gameplay elements *Similar to the above, the 'titles' you get for meeting certain criteria in a mission mean nothing except for gaining a few achievements *As with the above, clients will give you optional objectives that affect your ranking (e.g. minimal violence) but they mean nothing so there's no point *The plot isn't great, but it isn't terrible either. You can make of it what you want but it boils down to you being in the  wrong place at the wrong time and getting dragged into corporate espionage in order to clear your name *I literally beat this game 100% in about 5 hours. Your mileage may vary, and there's always workshop content to keep it fresh  CONS: *The one important decision in the game makes exactly one minor change to the game -   on the final level, a single extra enemy will appear. That's it.   No changes to stages or even objective or enemy layout *Dialogue choices which you might assume would be important do not actually matter at all. Aside from getting some achievements (all of which you can get simply by replaying the mission and exploring all dialogue options) not a single dialogue choice makes a lick of difference to the plot, gameplay or ending *You'll have to replay the final mission at least 7 times (maybe 6?) to round up the last of the achievements if that's your thing *I would go so far as to say the campaign is too easy. The foundations laid for map design would lend themselves well to some very challenging level design but I do not feel the base campaign fully explores all of its options - while having multiple ways to complete a level is good, too many ways to complete it is not *At some point there was an achievement for checking all the laptops in the game. Now that it is gone there is literally no need to get to them (most of which are harder to get to than the mission objectives) other than providing a little flavor text *  The game just kinda drops at the ending. No epilogue or nothing, just credit roll and a blog entry by the protagonist that does nothing to wrap up the plot  ",

            "review_text": "Writing a good film noir story is a lot trickier than it seems. A writer has to put together a fresh and kicking story line in spite of the mess of tropes that anyone attempting the genre has to follow (all broads are packin' heat, all cops are vultures, all private eyes drink heavily and have overactive internal monologue-glands, and 95% of everybody is lying to your face), and must do so in the most circuitous way possible, leaving a fine blend of clues, red herrings, and unintentional whatsits all over in order to keep the reader happy, confused, and eager to read on. At best, a failed attempt at film noir turns into a goofy comedy. At worst, you wind up with a pretentious pile that drags badly and signals whodunnit long before our antihero gets his teeth loosened at the tail end of a bad lead for the first time. Gunpoint actually manages to pull off a solid (if somewhat minimalist) film noir in the very unorthodox medium of 2D platform puzzler, and I couldn't be happier.  Set in a near- (if somewhat implausible) future, you play the poor sap who lives across the street from a major player in the small arms industry of America. Following recent legislation, firearms possession has become almost entirely illegal outside of police hands, but that doesn't stop you from getting embroiled in a trail of murder, betrayal, and espionage. Although initially motivated only by an urge to clear your name of a murder you had no part in, you quickly wind up playing for all parties involved, purchasing new gizmos and gadgets to aid you in breaking and entering along the way. While stealth gameplay is certainly a factor, more often than not you wind up making the building you're breaking into do all the hard work for you, 'hacking' the electronics systems to work as you see fit. Make light switches open locked doors, power outlets taze guards, and motion detectors ignore you entirely, and you'll be able to acquire everything you need without winding up on the wrong end of a gun even once. Usually. Sometimes there's little choice besides punching someone's lights out, but more often than not you'll find that fights are best avoided.  The artwork's simple pixelwork, but it's charming all the same. The mechanics are fun and expand with each level, avoiding any chance of the gameplay going flat halfway through. Death is penalized only with a quick reload from your choice of the three most recent autosaves, and these are created every time you do anything of note. My only real gripes would be that the game's a little short and that the UI could've been a few notches crisper, but by and large I am very happy with this end product. A better way to burn through a gray September afternoon than a headful of bad memories and a rapidly-emptying bottle of forgetfulness.",

You start off the game as a Private Investigator that is down on his luck and looking for a job. As you go through you earn money to buy more gadgets before you accept missions and upgrade the gadgets and tools you purchased. These tools you purchase help to make your Puzzle solving for each level a little easier, and have different ways of completing objectives. But mostly from time to time you will find that most of the puzzles will have only a few ways of completing them.  To be honest I couldn’t get enough of watching the guards look for me in the dark or the countless number of times I would knock out a guard with an electric door, to find out that his partner just came down to the same level and attempt to turn on the lights that are hooked up to that same door I stand next to. *flip* Light’s turn on, and hello door to the face.

There were a number of plot points and things that could have happened differently, and I felt, while playing, that had I have done different things I would have gotten a different ending. However, unlike most other 'multiple choice' games, at no point did I feel that I should go back to get '100% completion'. Usually you are choosing between two good – or more frequently, bad – choices. No one is superior over another, only different.  The replayability of the game is actually a little mixed. I feel that I would like to replay the story again to see if I could get a different sort of ending, but replaying the levels would be either boring, or an exercise in speedrunning. These seem at cross purposes.  Overall, it's a great short game, and I think it's well worth your money, even to play through just once.",

A game engine which is created for kids to be able to use easily because of its drag and drop features. It doesnt mean it cant be used by adults or teens. It has a unique language called GML. Which stands for Game Maker Language.  Now this isnt the only game made in GM. Hotline Miami was also made in Game Maker. I mean :O that game was EPIC and so is this game.  Now about the actual game. Whats so cool about it? Well you can jump through glass and land on a guy then beat him to death. You can re-wire doors so when the security guard opens it it knocks him out. Think of this game as the game Watch_Dogs wanted to be.  The game is fun and has decent replayability. Thanks to the Workshop you can put in couple more hours into the game thanks to the amazing levels made by the community.  I would say the game takes rougly 3 or so hours to complete. And because there are 2 endings it would make it to about 5. Im shaving an hour off as you will know what to do in the levels as you had completed them. Plus another 2 hours at least from the workshop which means the total time played should be about 7 hours. But it really depends if you just decide to complete the game 2 times or not.  Also make sure to read what people say between levels :) you might get an achivment or two and you also might earn some in game money ;)  Overall I'd give this game a 10/10.

Gameplay itself is mostly stealth oriented with you sneaking around various buildings trying to steal information or technology as well as accesing optional laptops that fill out the back story. The game uses a kind of hacking system that allows you to access the wiring of a building and do things like make a light switch open or close a secure door etc. The main puzzling comes from what to wire to what so that you can get to your destination without being caught. The puzzles start off simple enough but quickly escalate, though never to the point where I got so stuck I could not progress. I had a great deal of fun with this one and I reccomend it to anyone who likes a puzzle game with a difference. The noir vibe and double crossing plot really appealed to me.  8 out of 10",

It's a noir-feeling game, but one that doesn't take itself seriously and doesn't adhere too strongly to the more annoying/sexist conventions of the genre. You play a freelance detective who gets embroiled in a thing and has to sneak around various facilities, mostly to hack their computers. Your detective has a pair of Hypertrousers that let them jump incredibly far/high and stick to walls/ceilings. Soon in the game, you also get a gadget that lets you rewire electronics in buildings (so, say, you can make a lightswitch stop affecting a light and make it open a door instead, or maybe open a trap door under a guard, or set off an electric shock from an outlet). Between these two major gimmicks, there's a lot of original-feeling puzzling to the game. I never felt overwhelmed by figuring out how to get into buildings, but still felt challenged in trying to do so without getting shot (your detective, while able to fall from incredible heights without damage, takes a single bullet to be killed). The plot is interesting enough for something tongue-in-cheek like this and has a few choices (enough so that, given the game's length, I'm tempted to replay). The music, while not 'I need the soundtrack' levels of good, is atmospheric and enjoyable.  The dialogue options for your detective generally have some amusing things you can say, the tooltips are written in a very off-the-cuff way, and there are some pretty funny achievements.   Overall, solid game. Quick, but has replayability for sure for those who like to perfect things. I got it on sale for $3, but even at the asking price of $10 I think it would've been worth it.

It looked like just one more pixelated, retro, run-of-the-mill Jump 'n' Run.  However, it is anything but.  Gunpoint is a tense, fast-paced spectacle of intuitive 2D-Action. You play as Richard Conway, a freelancing spy. During the game it is your job to break and enter several highly guarded locations. You're being helped in this endeavor by your bullfrog superjump trousers, and your smartphone, which is capable of rewiring an entire building. At the beginning ofthe game, Richard is framed for a murder he didn't commit and must now jump around like a frog on meth to find the true culprit.  I could waffle on about the graphics, but that would be tedious. So I'll say this: Gunpoint's gameplay makes up for it in a multitude of ways. There is never an unwinnable situation that you can't think your way out of. Sadly, the game is pretty short, clocking in only about two hours. But those two hours have more substance than every AAA-game of the last year combined.",

All in your quest to find the guy that hired the guy to kill the woman (first mission) that worked for the woman who hired you. The plot actually makes a lot of sense though.

The downsides to this game (and there are a few) is the overall bugginess. I've had this game crash on me several times, and usually in situations where I didn't have the time and effort invested in the level to actually boot the game back up and play it again. However, the game is almost built to know this and usually starts back up where it crashed, leaving me to continue where I was (if I cared enough to start again).

The Ambience, music and artistic style combine to form a noir style that I have not found executed so well in a game before. The controls are easy to pick up in short order, becoming second nature and allowing the player's emersion into the world to start sooner and go that much deeper as it begins so early.

Considering your first playthrough isn't likely to take more than two hours and its developer had no releases under his belt prior to making this, Gunpoint is an incredibly charming and engaging game that managed to hit almost all of the right notes. Its gameplay, consisting of side-scrolling espionage and puzzle-solving, demands careful thought but is never punishing thanks to a very generous autosave function. It's incredibly aesthetically pleasing, with superb pixel art and great animations. Its soundtrack fits the noir stylings perfectly, cramming a range of dynamic tracks into the game's twenty levels. Finally, one of Gunpoint's greatest assets comes in the form of its writing. The story, despite its brevity, is remarkably well-written, and manages to accomplish far more than most games in a mere two hours, full as it is of wit and ironic, self-referential humour.   The main problem Gunpoint suffers from, however, is that it's just too short. It is very satisfying to solve its various puzzles, and the story is paced well for its length, but it's hard to escape the feeling that the game ends just as it's beginning to hit its stride. As it was programmed and designed by one man this is understandable, but - regardless of the circumstances it was developed in - Gunpoint's ending still feels premature. This is probably preferable to a game that outstays its welcome, but a game leaving before it really makes itself comfortable is also unfortunate.  Ultimately, I'd strongly recommend Gunpoint. It reminded me a lot of Ghost Trick (a DS game that also carries a strong recommendation) and figuring out how to bypass certain obstacles made me feel very clever indeed. Just don't be surprised if you aren't totally satisfied by the time the credits roll.",

A few rounds and you would probably find yourself exiting the game. But if you enjoy puzzles and using your brain to figure out stuffs, this is the game you would consider giving it a go.

I feel if it had gone much much longer than it did, the mechanics would have gotten a bit dry.  The dialouge has 2 paths more or less. You can be funny or serious. Niether has a change to the story but depending on what you go with you may get additional dialouge and the funny ones do hit the mark most of the time.  The music is absolutley fantastic if you like the smooth jazz / noir type music. I recommend getting the soundtrack to this game.  Keep in mind the game is only a few hours long although you do have a reason to play it twice if you want to see the second ending you didn't choose but if time is a big factor for value for you then you may want to pass this up unless its on a deep sale.",

I really appreciate the fact that I can easily pick this game up, play for an hour, put it down and then come back and not lose a beat from when I played last. Gunpoint does this trick exceptionally well. The controls are very intuitive so the only task presented to you when you come back is to figure out the next mission.  Missions are challenging but not punishing. There are some head-scratchers in here but they won't force anyone to look for an outside guide or anything of that sort. Also, the game rewards and encourages creative solutioning so there's good chance a puzzle could (and should) be solved in various ways. Even though I'm only on my first playthrough, I have full intention to playing it more times to see how else I could have solved previous missions.  Now that community made missions are in the future roadmap for Gunpoint, the money spent on the game seems even more well-spent.",

The characters speak in text boxes and the deadpan humor is awesome.  The game is short. I beat it in only 11 hours. On the bright side the game features a level editor to create your own missions and there is already a fair amount of content on the steam workshop. It's also only $5.00 so you really can't go wrong.",

            "review_text": "A small but highly entertaining package, with bags of replay value, fun and varied achievements which reward experimentation rather than simple linear story progression, and a brilliantly atmospheric soundtrack.  Gunpoint is a 2D side-scroller usually taking place in an array of office buildings, police stations and skyscrapers. You play Richard Conway; hat-lover, trenchcoat-wearer and amateur spy extraordinaire. Framed for a murder you didn't commit, you must use a mixture of gadgets, stealth, smarts and combat to clear your name. Then, you must clear the name of the person you accidentally framed while clearing yourself. Whoops.  The graphical style makes use of small sprites, barely an inch high, that are nonetheless colourful and easy to distinguish. This is fortunate because it allows the zoomed-out camera angle to take in the entirety of the buildings comprising each level. In each stage, Conway must evade/knock-out/kill/trap/etc. the various types of guards in his way to secure his objective and then escape to the subway. His first gadget to help him do this is a pair of Super Trousers which catapult him through the air as though fired from a cannon. With these he can leap enormous heights and distances, crash through plate glass windows, and land on top of enemy guards, at which point the player can render the guard unconscious with a single punch achieved by clicking the left mouse button (which performs most of the actions in the game), or pound their face into bloody mulch with repeated clicking (level of psychosis down to individual preference).  The main feature of the game - aside from the Super Jump Trousers - is the Crosslink, in which a quick scroll of the mousewheel gives players a view of all the electrical systems in the building, and enable these systems to be rewired. Rewiring these systems allows players to turn lights on and off, open and close doors, activate and deactivate security cameras, and distract or knock out guards. As the game progresses, the number and variety of electrical devices in each level increases, and the game also adds different circuits within the same building, forcing the player to become increasingly cunning and intricate in their approach to each mission.  Guard AI is fairly predictable, even with the introduction of different types of guard as the game progresses. However, the game remains challenging because while the guards can be dispatched with only one hit, so can the player, so being seen is almost certain death. Increased guard numbers in later levels combined with increasingly tricky electrical systems mean the player can quite easily open a door accidentally and allow a guard to see them, or trip an alarm and call the guards running, but while challenging the game never becomes frustrating, due to a fantastic and frequent autosave system - with no loading times anywhere to be seen - and is also never unfair: any deaths the player suffers are guaranteed to always be their own fault. Taking their time to look over the building's electrical wiring and the guard's patrol patterns should reward players with a deathless playthrough, but once upgrades and gadgets have been unlocked they can be used in earlier levels, meaning that it becomes possible to speedrun the game if preferred.  Replay value is added by the large number of achievements - only a handful of which are guaranteed to be unlocked in a single playthrough - and an intuitive level editor that allows the player to build a level every bit as complex as the story missions from the ground up. Gunpoint is a short game - the story can probably be completed in 30 minutes or so (but probably not on a first playthrough) - but the multiplicity of methods for completing each level - stealthy or loud; thoughtful or speedy; by evasion or by bloodbath, and everything in between - ensure that the game could be played through many times and still never have to become repetitive.",

Highly recommend for anyone looking for bite-sized challenges to tackle, accompanied by humorous dialogue and a detective narrative. Now, for some of the quirks I think are worth mentioning in order of personal priority:  - I love myself some old-fashioned UI goodness, but let's keep the puzzling inside the actual game. You guys managed to get me lost a few times. It's clunky and looks like it's in prototype phase. There's so much weird about it from the default font to the animation-less design, info and button placement that I can't help but think this didn't get a lot of attention yet and it really would go a long way to help make this game even more awesome.  - The music ties the game together nicely, but its volume slider is probably programmed by the composers themselves. I had to bring it down to properly balance it out with sond effects. I'm pretty sure music is affected only from 0% to 10% with the rest of the bar having next to no meaning. Actually, you can still hear music when the UI displays 'off'. Oh, and please crossfade the music when jumping to and from Crosslink mode.  - While the level overview is understandable and nice to have initially, I would have liked to be able to zoom in and escape the feeling of living in a miniature city. Even if it does blow up all pixely in my face. There's a lot of unused screen real estate even on 1080p, can't imagine how it's like on 4k screens. Well, I can. But it'll only remind me that I don't have one.",

The puzzles are challenging, the dialogue is well written, and the story in engaging and gets more interesting the more it unfolds. While you can easily finish it in a few hours, on sale, this is one of the best titles I've played in a long time. As for replayability, you can replay every mission with all of the game's gadgets once you finish it (you will be able to unlock everything), and many missions have multiple solutions.   I give this title a 9/10 for its witty main character, its funny dialogue, and challenging stealth-based puzzles all folded into a dark, noir style story of murder and revenge.",

Knowing that this is an indie game they dont have the time for servers, even though they have enough servers for the end game content. I would also like to see the difficulty curve be a little steeper. I managed to beat the game between 1.5-2 hours consistenly. This brings me to my final point, recommending this game. It is not a binary situation, I would recommed it when its on sale but other than that I would say this game is not worth it.",

No matter what I do I don't think I will ever be able to play more than the few hours of gameplay I got the first day I got the game.

I bought this during the winter sale because I thought it was similar to Bonanza Bros for the Sega Genesis. I wasn't too wrong, but it strays mechanically from the formula quite a lot. You play as a P.I. who gets involved in a larger conspiracy between multiple factions. The narrative plays out through text messages that give you a fake semblance of 'choice.' The core element of the game seems to be rewiring contraptions around the buildings you infiltrate, which isn't very deep. Thematically, I understand the concept of being about to rewire a motion sensor that a guard walks past to open a door in your way, but how it's handled doesn't make much sense. You can perform any of these rewireing actions at any place, anywhere. It takes away from the tension of evasion, that it doesn't really feel like much work to do. I also ran into a couple bugs in the game that caused me to close it out of frustration.  Overall, the game was decent for it's price during the winter sale, but I wouldn't strongly recommend it.",
