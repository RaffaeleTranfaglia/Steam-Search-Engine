            "review_text": " Update: Having now completed the game. I have added a few more bullet points (in italics). Mild spoilers.     I have no idea what's happening storywise.    The enemies look ridiculous and are hard to beat unless you can pre-empt them.    Your character's name changes subtly with every person who tries to pronounce it.    There is a strong possibility you'll drop a lung laughing at the jump scares.    It tries to imitate Slenderman by using what I can only assume is a Source version of ET, and even then they fail to have it chase you.    And I'm pretty sure I missed an item I need in an area I'm now locked out of.   I got killed by an exploding chest with a russian man dancing on it while 'who let the dogs out' played until I quit.    Puzzles include  tilting a Hitler painting to move a bookcase, but only AFTER some enemies have appeared , and articulation of this idea is totally non-existent.    One puzzle requires a circular saw. There is a circular saw in the room, but you can't use it for whatever reason. You need one from somewhere else.   You will lose contact with the floor and get stuck in jump animation loops when walking over objects like 'newspaper' and 'stairs'   One of the bosses appear twice because... I'm not sure.   The rest of the bosses are poorly explained, or just dumb.   Some enemies are spawned next to doors. These enemies will absorb 15 rounds from the MP-40, but down you with 3-4 knife hits.    You will never, ever, pick up the ammo in front of you first. You will magnetically attract buckets and chairs first, and once they're gone you'll still be at the wrong angle/distance to obtain the ammo.   The story is no clearer by the end than the begininning. Not sure if it's there at all, actually.   Final boss sucks. Not sure you can even call it a boss.   You can't enter the final area until you do some convoluted ♥♥♥♥ to turn the lights on because 'it's dark down there'. I was holding a torch. And it turns out some people were  fighting off waves of enemies for a long time  down there. Apparently in the dark.  [/i]  [/list]  There you have it. Still recommending it (for comedy purposes):  10/10  However, as an actual game:  3/10 ",

It is a fairly smooth game doesnt seem to really get hung up on any of the changing scenes I have tried. There is tension in the game almost from the very begining, The music really adds to the atmosphere as well as the other sounds involving unseen as of yet characters/npcs. It seems ot be a puzzle game the sort where you really have to figure out what your doing as you go along. I admit that I did not delve very deeply into the game as I am not a huge fan of horror/suspense, but I think this game has hit it on the head of the nail. I am probably going to let my wife, who is into this sort of game much more than I am have a go at it.",

            "review_text": "This is one of those games where I wish there was a 'neutral' rating.  This game isn't very long, but it is fairly spooky and grim. The graphics are not much better than what you would find in Half-Life 2. Sometimes this works against the game because there are a lot of reflective effects and that makes it hard to see. This isn't the worst problem.  The AI isn't really that great, and can be easily thwarted if you stand on something. It will walk up to you, but it can't attack. You can whack whatever is trying to kill you pretty quickly with anything on hand. This isn't even necessary, since there is enough ammunition to kill mostly everything you come across, unless you are a horrendously bad shot. The environment isn't that well constructed and, regretably, this persists to the end of the game.   That being said, the story is pretty grim, but that is to be expected with a sociopath nazi doctor. The manor is pretty spooky, and the game is thankfully mild with the jump-scares. I just wish there was less ammunition and more room to maneuver and there was an opportunity to hide. Basically, I wish this game was more like Amnesia.   The controls, music, and voice acting are fairly competent, but the translations are bad. They are not bad enough to be completely indecipherable, but the developers could have done better. They could have definitely done better with the climax and the ending, as the last chapter has a puzzle that makes no sense and a fight that was just not that good. The ending was odd as well.   All of this being said, the game was fun enough for me to play it all the way through and go after the acheivements.",

Whoever you are, you might as well go to the curators, because if you've come for a review on this game, you've come to the wrong place. However, if you have come for an outstanding chocolate chip cookie recipe, you've come to the right place. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Ingredients 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter 3/4 cup packed dark brown sugar 3/4 cup sugar 2 large eggs 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 (12-ounce) bag semisweet chocolate chips, or chunks 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour 3/4 teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon fine salt  Directions 1. Evenly position 2 racks in the middle of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F. (on convection setting if you have it.) Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone sheets. (If you only have 1 baking sheet, let it cool completely between batches.)  2. Put the butter in a microwave safe bowl, cover and microwave on medium power until melted. (Alternatively melt in a small saucepan.) Cool slightly. Whisk the sugars, eggs, butter and vanilla in a large bowl until smooth.  3. Whisk the flour, baking soda and salt in another bowl. Stir the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients with a wooden spoon; take care not to over mix. Stir in the chocolate chips or chunks.  4. Scoop heaping tablespoons of the dough onto the prepared pans. Wet hands slightly and roll the dough into balls. Space the cookies about 2-inches apart on the pans. Bake, until golden, but still soft in the center, 12 to 16 minutes, depending on how chewy or crunchy you like your cookies. Transfer hot cookies with a spatula to a rack to cool. Serve.  5. Store cookies in a tightly sealed container for up to 5 days.  For a Rocky Road Bar: 1. Lightly butter a 9 by 13-inch baking pan. Make the batter as per cookie recipe and fold in 1 cup chopped walnuts along with the chocolate chips. Spread batter in prepared pan. Bake until the edges are light brown and the batter sets, about 45 minutes. Cool slightly and cover surface with 4 cups marshmallows and 1 cup chocolate chips. Broil at least 8 inches from the heat until marshmallows turn golden brown, about 2 minutes. (Keep an eye on the marshmallows, and turn the pan frequently--they go from golden to char in a wink.) Cool, cut and serve.",

            "review_text": "I've just had a look at the 'kinda useful Guide' - I got to a certain point just outside the House before going into the Tunnel. It was kind of a relief, like getting a grip on reality, reading and realising how other people had been through (more-or-less) the same experience I had just had. Jeez that was scary as ..... I'm really enjoying feeling my way around, and getting jumped out-at so I may not go back to the guide this first time around. Although did somehow the Garden Shed get forgotten? I do not want to give a spoiler so I won't go into it - what happens, not the shed I mean... Mind you, the 'Kinda useful guide' kind of gives away more from what it DOESN'T tell you (like the Garden Shed), than what it does. When you have played the game some you will figure out what it is Chronos is writing between-the-lines. And that is that the 'exploring' (sic) side of things, in between picking up things or killing things, unless you are a truly hardened horror-fan (or maybe one of the undead), is the very last thing you will want to be doing as you play the game. You constantly want to be out-of-there, with all this horrible nightmare cleared up by the good guys. But in 'The Forgotten Ones' there is only you..., and some fairly feeble weaponry considering what you will have to face. I don't want to suggest that this turns itself into a gore-blaster, that would spoil the dangerous fear you will experience playing it. There are plenty of games during which you need never fear, because you have a .50 cal - or a zip-saw or whatever, which will decimate, given a reasonable aim and a sensible approach, anything that is likely to move against you. I don't generally play horror games, I'm a WWII gamer at heart, it was the story-line that caught my eye and got me to try it out. So far, I found the game drew me in quickly to become a hellishly scary experience - and it definitely gets my vote. I only downloaded yesterday so I guess I got the patched version, there isn't really anything to complain about. I read some bad-reviews and had those in mind when I installed it, but pleased to say, and I don't have a top-whack pc, the game is running fine for me. The key action for the Hotel got a bit sticky, but a couple of try's and it was OK. Opening it up for user-made stories, that is truly awesome, and in the true gamer spirit. It's getting dark now, so I guess I'll have to wait till tomorrow before I can explore some more...",

Because your ♥♥♥ is too stupid to pick the clip up again later and shove a bullet in it or even save the clip altogether. -Running and hitting animations suitable for my autistic uncle -Notes written by 13 year olds who keep continously flunking the fifth grade -Jump scares every 30 seconds that make you want to burst out laughing at how terrible they are. Amazing, highly recommend. -Monsters that can hit you 3 times in a single second and do not stop long enough for you to shoot/hit them back properly -Dying -Dying -Still dying because that monster hitting you makes it impossible to shoot them back -Dying -Surving just once luckily -Having two of said monsters spawn right outside of a tiny room and waltz right in on you LESS THAN 15 SECONDS AFTER YOU GOT PAST THE LAST ONE -♥♥♥♥thisshit.jpeg -Quit -Instant uninstall  The game is truly astounding, a masterpiece birthed into our world by a remarkable man. The morals of this story are the voice of our generation, and truly touch upon what is dear to our hearts.

In my oppinion it's a better horror game then Cry Of Fear. It's very atmospheric and I really jumpscared a few times. But it's pretty dark and ambient driven horror, what I like personally more. The game is also very long, 7 hours is really not bad. Another half hour was needed for completing. :) To finish the game isn't easy, because the enemies are really hard to beat and you can get easily lost. The question 'Where should I go?' was the only really bad thing I've ever experienced in this game. Some passages could be frustrating for not that experienced players. But please take your time to learn how to act against which enemy. Everything is doable. It only needs some time, sometimes. :D If you stay with a will to see the ending, it's really rewarding and an enjoyable horror game after all. :) (\\ô/)",

Not a very well developed story... but it is enough to make you jump at every sound and movement and constantly watch your back. When I did meet my first enemy, I nearly slammed my mouse into my wall, which is a good 2 feet away. The gameplay mechanics take a little while to get used to but they are not bad ones. The amount of ammo that they give you is pretty good until you start encountering more enemies, then it slowly drains because you jump and fire off half your shots at the sky in terror. Out of every free horror game I have had the chance to play, The Forgotten Ones and Cry Of Fear both fall into my top slots.",

The main menu and inventory use this awful LOUD “ding” sound when you highlight different things. It’s incredibly off putting and just plain annoying.

I think the whole purpose of this game is to attract those 'Pewdiepie' youtubers who see a monster, get a spaz attack, then they say they can't play the game anymore. I mean, its a source mod. That sort of defeats the purpose of having a scary game when everything look like a cartoon show. They give you no tutorial what so ever, and they put combat in a horror game. Thats like breaking rule number 1 of horror. The bullets they gave you are underpowered, so its not like your going to kill the enemy in the first place. Another thing, when an enemy jumps out, most of the time your in a small confined room. That makes it difficult to shoot when it runs at you extremly fast along with the fact that when it hits you, your camera swing everywhere. Enemies also have no delay in their attack time so if you get cornered, you are finished. The sound effects are kind of unsettling, but otherwise, the music and soundloops are just little things that come with source. The way items work in the game too is kind of odd. From what I see, you select the itm and click use, like Amnesia. However, when you click use, nothing happens. The item entity doesn't appear on your reticule like Amnesia, instead you have to be at point blank with your target to use the item when you click use, making you vulnerable to any monster that comes near. Another thing I have to say, hiding is useless. It says you can hide, like in normal horror games, but when it comes down to an actual encounter with a monster, they can just sniff you out. I think its default programming in source for the monsters to find you, but othern than that, I honestly don't know. For example, at one point there was a shed outside of the main building you were exploring, and I went inside and picked up a lantern. I heard a monster noise, so I closed the door and hid in a corner by some shelves. I heard two monsters run up to the shed, bang the door down, tear up my hiding spot, and kill me. They didn't even pause for a second. But all in all, I would not recomend this game to anyone who is actually going to try and play a horror game with the expectations of geting scared or having fun.",

To be able to call it a survival horror first the player needs to be able to survive the monster, in this case the monster is just too quick and strong to out run and fight. 3) The guns are too weak. The guns might as well be firing blanks as the guns seem to do no damage at all to the monsters, it neither hinders them nor weakens their attack.  4) When trying to pick up ammo the player seems to grab the most useless item first, this causes to fling the ammunition accross the room and into some small crevice out of reach.
