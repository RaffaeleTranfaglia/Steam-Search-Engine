You will actually be very surprised.  4 capters is avaible. it took me around 10 mintues per chapter to complet since i am a really bad jumper for most platformer game. Very interesting background story for each chapters.  Don't really have achievements and I hope it gets added soon.  Music is really sweet and smoothing.. graphics is just about none-existant but i like the style...  Quick puzzle game.. 8/10.. play.. enjoy.. delete when you have 1 hour spare.",

The early story as well was engaging, and pretty touching for such a short game. However, I found that after the first two chapters, my engagement tapered off, and by the final chapter, there wasn't as much wit imbued within the platforming puzzles, so that it felt a bit more of a grind. The soundtrack was good, appropriately fitting the tone of the game, but not developing from its inception.  I enjoyed this game, but if I had payed full price may have felt a little disappointed. It offers about a hour of gameplay, without any real replayability.  6/10",

The music in the game is nice and calming, yet portrays the mood effectively.  There is a story to tell and it's not a happy one at all.  Overall 8/10.  However, don't buy the game.",

            "review_text": "I write this recommendation with some hesitance. I know that people who buy games expect ones to take up a decent amount of their time. I once thought that if a game was longer, that made it better, and would criticize shorter games based on their length (my arguement against Over the Void, and my criticism of the original Portal come to mind), but I think in some ways I've changed my stance on that view. But I know plenty of other people haven't. That's fine. They can suck it.  Pretentious Game is a game without about as much length and content as Over the Void, but the biggest difference between the two that keeps me from changing my recommendation from a 'no' to a 'yes' on Over the Void, is the type of content each contains. Don't get me wrong, these two games have nothing similar, apart from their hour's worth of playtime. But between games like these and even Hook, is that Pretentious Game intends to tell a story, and uses it's mechanics not only to teach the player what they need to do to beat a level, but also tell them the context of what's going on.  Sure, there are bits, where I had no idea that the red blocks were supposed to be a car. I personally the mechanics and story got a little wobbly during the third and fourth chapters. But the first and second were pure gold for me, and I couldn't stop playing. Sure, it can pick up mechanics and later drop them oddly enough. Some mechanics don't fit well into the story (Hangliding? Really!?), but what Pretentious Game succeeds at, it does well. The nonlinear storytelling between the three chapters sets up what might at first seem to be a simple story, but gradually branches out and explains everything. Did I like chapter four at all? No. Not really. It kinda stunk of BS, and had little to do with the events of the preceding chapters, other than the kids were related to the one woman.  But Pretentious Game is pretentious, as much as it is a game. It's a little too overdramatic, and little cheesey here and there, but it has some pretty dark imagery for a game where the art is all made of pixels. You'll only get about an hour's worth of gameplay (and there is little replay value), but if a fifth chapter were released, I'd still install it again just to find out what happens next.",

Luckily, I only payed two pounds for this rather than four as i got probably 15 to 20 minutes of new gameplay. Don't spend your money on this game. If you want to play it, go to Armor Games and it'll be there for free. For two pounds more you can get a GOOD narrative puzzler called Thomas Was Alone. For three more pounds you can get Portal. If you want a game worth your money, don't buy this one.",

Cons: - short, like really really short - adds absolutely nothing to what you can play for free (4 chapters with promise of more ...eventually) - yes it's FREE !!! (or 5€ for suckers) - did I already mention steam version adds nothing? Oh, no wait. It gives you the ability to play episodes without changing browser tab. But that would be it.  Conclusion: Don't waste your money. Play it on kongregate. Or if you really need to buy it, get it in bundle or huge discount (unless you just want to support the dev then go ahead, it's your money)",
