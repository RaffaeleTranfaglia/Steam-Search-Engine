            "review_text": "This is an initial review of MadOut Ice Storm, I will update this review once I've played it for a few hours, to add anything that I may have missed.         If you like vehicular combat games like   Crashdays  ,   Clutch (aka Armageddon riders via PS3)  ,   Carmageddon  ,   Death Rally  ,   Gas Guzzlers Extreme  ,   Spit Second   or the online   Dark-wind   plus numerous other titles with car combat, '  MadOut Ice Storm   is a real treat. It's got similarities to Carmageddon and Gas Guzzlers Extreme with respect to game play and graphics (though you don't kill pedestrians as you do in Carmageddon, nor do you have the wacky weapons you get in that game; however, price-wise its less than a quarter of the price of either of those games, i.e. £4.99 (at the moment its on sale at £3.99) so most community members can probably afford it. For this you get a decent game with all the usual stuff you'd expect of a vehicular combat game, i.e. guns, mines, rockets, nitrous, health etc, loads of different rural and town tracks and a selection of cars, all of which are upgradable. You earn in game cash by winning races; the lower down the field you finish, the less money you get. The more you get, the better you can upgrade for the next race. It's not got Need for Speed, Flatout, Dirt or Grid like graphics; looking a little pale along side those titles, but for such a price this game is a steal.  Vehicle handling is decent, though nothing special; still, it does the job. You can re-configure the keyboard mapping to your liking, for example, if you are left handed like me you'll probably want to change the steering and weapon controls around as I was initially playing the game with my arms crossed. I've not checked whether the game can be played with a wheel and pedal controller yet (mines been boxed since we moved), but you can use a controller instead of the keyboard.  Anyway, if you like driving games and like shooting rockets and guns at other vehicles, get this game now before the price rise; I guarantee you won't regret it.",
