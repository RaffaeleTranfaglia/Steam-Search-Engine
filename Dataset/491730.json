            "review_text": "The game is boring at first but once you start to unlock the first upgrades, it gets easier. What keeps the game interesting is the bosses at each 100 points earned and the fact that each level gets harder and harder. The only downside of the game is that there is only 5 upgrades, which don't take long to get! The only thing I think is missing is the lack of upgrades.",
