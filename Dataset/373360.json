    "description": "Cast of the Seven Godsends harks back to the days when classic 2D, run â€™n gun, action-shooter games ruled the arcades. Four levels of difficulty, six worlds to conquer, twelve mid and end-of-level bosses, seven god-like armour sets, five basic weapons and thirty-five magic combat spells!",

Like said before me, quite a bit in this game is obviously inspried by the Ghosts n Goblins/Ghouls n Ghosts series. Even with the lame weapons (axe).  The magic feature of the Seven God/Dieties in-game is pretty cool and that power-up brought back flashbacks of Ghouls n Ghosts.  If you like old school difficult, but fair in it's execution. Check this out. If it's on sale, it's a must buy.  My only complaint is the lack of save feature; which is minor, but for many modern players, it's a major downside.  I suppose another downside for those interested it the lack of Trading Cards. I hope this gets updated so trading cards are added.",

It has enough content for good potential but with so many other fantastic retro side-scroller platformers on Steam there isn't any reason to play this one. Voice acting is bad enough that text-only would have been better, sounds are repetitive, and the level design is boring. The initial bosses can be defeated by just standing out of their fire range and taking pot shots at them.  Edit: Playtime is high because after I closed the game part of it kept running in the background and I didn't realize it until the next day.",
