Quests aren't repetitive Cons:  1. Acting is TERRIBLE  2. Graphics are not the best, its a pretty old game after all  3. Quests are annoying at times, like i said, acting is really bad  4. Can get quite annoying  Reason for recommendation:  While the acting is terrible and the quests can be annoying, I personally enjoyed it just cause you can go out and just level up endlessly and the gear has a fun upgrading system, you can get more of the same item and combine them to make it better, but it will still be the same item. So, say you take out a tower, and like every other guy had the same weapon. You can then take all the weapons and combine them together and get a weapon that may just be better than what you're using. Worst comes to worst you can always sell it and not worry about having to carry around 15+ weapons to get your gold. I have always enjoyed a game that has endless upgrading. This one is enjoyable too if you can get past the terrible acting and just do your own thing.",

            "review_text": "Don't compare this game to Oblivion. Try Gothic 1, then compare games again... or try Arx Fatalis and come back.  Two Worlds is a grand effort from a small team to try to make a game they'd want to play. A labor of love, so to speak. It's for that reason why I love the Gothic series (especially the third one).  In Two Worlds, you don't get the feel and controls of a triple A game franchise. You get handcrafted, homecooked, delicious, awkward experimentation from gamers who love games.  Remember Peter Jackson's first few movies? Would it surprise you to know that the guy who gave us all the Lord of the Rings movies started out just making random, insane films, like 'Dead Alive' and 'Meet the Feebles'? Innovation requires risk.  Two Worlds does things a bit differently and that's what's worth taking notice of. Sure, horse controls are awkward, and your main character says 'Mayhap' and 'Perchance' enough times in the first hour to make you want to invent time travel and murder ancient languages... but keep playing.  Keep playing and discover an absolutely massive world with very, very little loading time, and a Morrowind-esque combat system. I dislike the Oblivion comparison because that game was truly real-time and Two Worlds is more die-rolls and random chance based on skill percentages like Morrowind, Dungeons and Dragons, Shadowrun, and... well... 80% of CRPG's that have come out in the last 35 years.  In summation: Voice acting: Bad to the point of comedic. Combat: Die rolls... not Oblivion. World: HOLY COW this thing is huge. Gameplay: Enough variation to keep me coming back. Horses: Not as good as Mount &amp; Blade, but better than Ride to Hell Retribution. Replayability: Mayhap I should complete it once before I judge this.  Two World's Epic Edition is of such quality that I can only compare it to Seth Rogen's 'The Interview': A lot of people said a lot of things about it, but when I finally saw it for myself, I realized that people don't really know anything and I should just judge things for myself. It's not perfect, but I like it anyway.",

Yes,maybe is not an AAA production but is worth playing for sure. Combat system is pretty funny indeed, and the spell creation mechanics are something i've never seen in a third person RPG.  There are various playstyles possibilities: stealth assassin,mage,archer or a brute tank vanquisher. Weapons and gears are in a good amount and the simple crafting system is well made too,with the possibility to recolour your armours. You can ride horses. Man wtf you have to try this. Enemies are various and in huge amounts but sometimes are a little dumb. The story is pretty long, not worth an Oscar prize but still enjoyable and there are tons of secondary (and funny) quests to do.",

            "review_text": "In some ways, this game is better than Oblivion, the main competitor in the open-world fantasy genre, but there are quite a few issues and a real lack of polish that prevents the game from reaching its full potential.  The main gripe is combat. At later levels, the game becomes severely punishing. Now I don't mind difficulty, but this game likes to suddenly throw overpowered monsters at you without warning. High level monster scale rediculously well. They will have a few times your health and do a couple times your damage. If you want to be able to take on high level challenges, you either have to grind out a lot of levels, which is done by killing monsters MMO style or through quests, or invest in the severely flawed magic system.  One can understand why the monster are so strong when one takes a look at what spells are available to the player. While finding the exact spell you want is nearly impossible, getting hands on any higher level spells makes your power level spike like crazy. I was able to get my hands on a reflect aura in the earth magic school. By abusing the magic system, I was able to get my reflect spell to reflect 70% of all damage. You heard that right, 70%. It seems the game will assume your use of of magic. By throwing out rediculous monsters, it forces you to be a sort of mage-warrior no matter what.  The leveling system in this game is actually more interesting than that of Oblivion's. There are a myriad of skills that can be learned, and the aforementioned magic system provides a bunch of really cool spells. Unfortunately, in terms of melee combat the game seems to favor two-handed weapons. The advantage of dual-wielding or using a sword and shield is the ability to parry attacks (done automatically). But one quickly realizes that isn't not worth it. It's far better to abuse the two-handed weapon's long range and simply physically avoid the ennemy blows, rather than nibling away at the enemy with the extremely short ranged one-handed weapons and relying on the dice to block strikes. It doesn't help that two-handed weapons all seem to deal double the damage of one handed weapons.   In a role-playing game, the player should never be forced to do something. All roles should be equally valid. Whether that be a mighty barbarian or a graceful duelist. But the game funnels you down a single path. With some more polish and a better balanced combat and magic system, I might have really enjoyed this game. But these gaping issues ruined it for me.",

Sometimes they have their moments but most of the time they struggke to reach average. But if you can somehow get past the inital crap then you find a gem.  Two Worlds is surprisingly deep, with a intriguing, large and beautiful world. The armor and weapons that you find start off looking rather dumb but soon you start finding very epic looking swords and axes, awesome spiked plate armor, damn i really liked one set of armor that i kept it for far longer then i should of, making the game harder then it should of been. The crafting system in Two Worlds is very simple, just drag and drop, but i felt it went very well with the style of game and allowd even weaker waepons to stay strong with a little extra effort. Alchemy is done well in the game as well, with you being able to craft many different potions of different effects out of many different ingrediants. And the world, i really enjoyed just exploring the massive world and slaughtering the all bandits and helpless animals i came across.  I reccomend Two Worlds but know that many people will not be able to get over its flaws. If realty pump only had a little extra funding or more time or whatever, they could of made a truely epic game.",

It's not Skyrim, DragonAge, or The Witcher, but I'm finding it to be a deeply interesting and fun RPG to play. It has a well developed world full of warring factions, magic, skills, and horse back riding. I actually like the horse back riding better in Two Worlds than in Skyrim (IMHO). The questing in my mind is what is the most fun in this game. Two Worlds is loaded with cities, caves, dungeons, and quests to complete. This is not an expensive game and I've seen it goes as low as 1.49. This game has issues and some very quirky dialogue, but I still recommend it. I could have finished the main quest 15 hours ago, but I'm having too much fun with the side quests. I've seen a lot of bad reviews for this game and I can understand some of the complaints, but I find this game so much fun and the quirks and bugs just simply don't bother me. 'Lovely weather' said the hero as he stormed through the rain shower that just popped up. Love It!",

            "review_text": "Two worlds is unique game because you'll hate it and love it the same time but after first hour you would't dare to stop before finishing it.   Two worlds has many problems from unstable frame rate and game not launching to horrible horse riding and even worse mounted combat.  There are not nearly enough tutorials and you'll end up checking forums every now and then. Combat can be bit difficult at first but after you'll get used to it and learn to use 'Q' button to dodge at the right time it will be almost too easy, almost.  Alchemy is extremely well done and magic is better than some games, but offers 5 schools of magic whit each unique spells, but still each having similar basic spells so you don't have to learn everyone to get attack, defense and summoning spells but should if you're playing as a mage. What makes fighting difficult sometimes is that two worlds allows a lot of enemies at once, for instance in the orc capital you might have to face 50+ enemies at once, while they're fighting each other too.  Story is not the best but the quests are unique and not repetitive as well as bountiful. Enemies offer wide range of fighting styles and some variation between same enemy types, for instance wolf will fight differently than zombie and bandit archer will fight differently than bandit mage.   Overall I'll recommend Two Worlds as it will give you 30+ hours of gameplay, but only if you like open world games and are a fan of RPGs and can look over some unpolished bits in favor of overall experience.

            "review_text": "This game is an underrated gem, I recommend it highly to any fan of open-world RPGs. It's biggest hurdle is just its first impression. The character creation is a joke, the cut-scenes &amp; voice-acting are hammy, the controls and menu navigation a bit unintuitive, initially.  However, give this game an hour or two to grow on you, and you will find a vastly underrated, very free, open-world fantasy RPG that will give you hundreds of hours of enjoyment. The loot is vast and randomly generated (and items are stackable, which means looting never gets entirely old); the levelling is well-paced and addictive; the scope of abilities interesting to experiment with (archery, traps, magic, various combat techniques, etc.) The alchemy/crystal system is very interesting as well, though you might want to download a strategy guide to get the most out of it.  Combat and enemy AI are weak and relatively easy to exploit, but that didn't bother me much -- I just view the game as more of a Diablo-esque, loot-driven kind of experience, vs. a game built around challenging/nuanced combat. And although the story and voice-acting initially seem awful, the cheesiness of it becomes a part of the charm, and the protagonist is often actually very funny. He becomes strangely good company as you go roaming the world by yourself.   Visually, the game holds up exceptionally well, if you have a good graphics card. I don't know if the graphics were revamped for the epic edition, but at times the game looks on a par with a high-end Skyrim, and the world can be quite beautiful. There is also a ton of detail in the armor, weapons, etc. I've also had no problems with bugs/crashes or anything like that, with the Epic Edition.   Also a plus: the world is absolutely *huge*. I am certain it is much bigger than any recent Bethesda games by far, and the environments are quite varied once you get out a bit.  In short, this is a game that got -- to my mind -- unfairly passed over when it was released. It does have its quirks and doesn't make a great first impression when you start up, but I can honestly say I've had as much fun with this game as any other open-world RPG you can name, and like it as well -- if not better -- than Skyrim. They're just different. At anything &lt;$20 -- let alone the 2.99 or so you often see it for -- it is an absolute steal.   Highly recommended.",

            "review_text": "Underneath this somewhat unpolished game, marred by huge expectations (pre-release hype expected this game to be the next Oblvion open-world game), and a horrible buggy release, lies an enjoyable, often unique open-world RPG game, a game that I can recommend to open-minded gamers.  It's amazing I can say that because on release, when I first got the Xbox 360 version, it looked like I had made a mistake. Tons of framerate issues, game-breaking bugs, and moreover a very unimpressive intro and beginner newbie area. The game eventually got patched, and I enjoyed it enough to later buy the PC version, and for my friends and I, Two Worlds 1 has become a guilty pleasure. I actually bought this twice on the PC, directly from publisher and later via Steam, so my hours don't reflect all of my accumulated playing time.  I have to stress, though, that you have to weather the horrible beginning of the game. The game cinematic intro is uninspiring, then it drops you into a forest area, eventually giving you a barebones tutorial that doesn't show you the cool features of the game. On top of that, you have to make your way to your first town which sports some of the worst voice acting I've heard heard in a game. Fortunately, the voice acting improves a bit as you get further into the game, however the dialogue is still pretty bad, but you get used to it.  On your way to the town, you may get mauled by wolves, which travel in packs, which until you learn the agro system of the game, you may die repeatedly. So often, gamers will just quit at this point, several hours into the game, which is a shame, and I believe why most people didn't give this game a fair shake. Lots to learn -- how to use the magic system, how to collect ingredients, how to handle night time creatures in the game (you won't be able to kill them initially so run away from them), etc.  I really liked the weapon-combining system which I wish more games would implement. You can combine similar weapons to upgrade your main weapon, so alleviates inventory issues, just keep combing that generic sword over and over. It also solves the moan-and-groan of finding junk loot, because in this game, you can make an uber weapon out of crappy weapons. Of course, eventually you'll want to combine higher-level weapons, but it's a great way to lessen inventory issues.  I also loved the co-op feature, able to the play the entire game again with a friend. Not sure if you can still do this, though, because I don't remember if it needed access to original Two Worlds servers.  Character models may look a bit dated, but the world still looks pretty good, and it has a lot of variety. Lots of side-quest and secrets to explore and enough variety to replay the game with different classes, which is also a strength, Classes aren't set in stone, but you can develop your character however way you want. Some people have issues with the mounting system, getting aggravated with the horse mount, but I found the PC version is far improved over the 360 version.  Two Worlds 2, the sequel, is by far, a more polished game, but TW1 sports a larger world, and doesn't have the weapon combining feature. If you can do some reading of the game mechanics, and not give up right away, you may find yourself enjoying this game.",

            "review_text": "Two Worlds is a game I had originally heard of, but never played until about a year ago. I didn't keep up with the hype and the marketing for this game, and it was because of a YouTuber called ProJared and his review of this game that I bought it, mainly to see if it was as bad as he said it was. And - surprise, surprise - he was right.  Two Worlds, according to ProJared's Review (be prepared to see ProJared's name come up a LOT in this 'review'), was going to put another game - The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion - to shame. Needless to say, it didn't even come close to matching Oblivion in anything. And I'm going to prove it.  The game starts off with the Main Character and his twin sister, Kira, riding through the rain. Kira is injured, and falls off the horse. Here is where one of the many problems of Two Worlds starts to show. First off, the voice acting. It's God-awful. Every single voice actor - well, with an exception or two - is bad. Every line of speech is forced, no emotion is in the dialogue and even worse, the text in the game looks like it was written by someone trying to emulate Shakespeare.  The story for this game is simple. As the Main Character goes to look for a shelter that he and Kira can stay in for the night to keep out of the rain, Kira gets kidnapped. About six months later, in the first village you're in (I don't remember what it was called, just more proof of how bad this game is) you recieve a letter telling you that your sister is alive. After reading the letter, the village elder gives you your first quest, the traditional cliché quest at the beginning of most RPGs out there: clear a cave of monsters. You do that, you come out of the cave which is really a temple, and when you're through with that task, some guy from the first village tells you that some 'hard warriors' have come looking for you. After that, you find the man who kidnapped your sister - Gandohar - and he tells you to go and meet his master Reist in the Goat's Cave. You meet Reist, and he tells you to go and talk to Gandohar. Refresh my memory, why did I need to go in there again? Anyways, speaking with Gandohar reveals that he 'claims' that he wants to help Kira, and to do that, he needs you to go and collect four treasures representing the four elements: Fire, Wind, Water, and Earth. There's also a fifth piece that binds them together just like that ring from Lord of the Rings. And apparently, only the Main Character and Kira can touch the key and nobody else can, similar to the Vampire Killer whip from the Castlevania franchise. That's really all I can say about the story, because I pretty much quit playing after that.  Gameplay: The gameplay is somewhat similar to Oblivion, but they somehow managed to screw that up. When you're fighting anything in this game, and I mean anything, it all basically amounts to a button masher swinging wildly at everything around you, and I mean everything. There's no surefire way to be sure that you're hitting something other than the blood that shoots out of enemies, and the punch sound that accompanies trying to hit something with a steel blade that clearly is there to cause bruises rather than draw blood, but whatever.  The graphics here are a mixed bag. The character models and everything look awful, to the point where they would barely pass as PS2 graphics, and they're animated so poorly. The lip-synching is also terrible, which makes Godzilla movies look masterful. However, and this is what I mean by the graphics being a mixed bag, is that not everything looks terrible, the enviroments are kind of nice. I can admit that.  The music sounds like your typical midieval sword &amp; sorcery-style RPG, with light tunes when exploring, heavy tunes when in danger, things like that.  All in all, I have to say that it's a damn shame this game didn't quite live up to the hype, because it shows great potential that could have easily put The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion to shame, but they let their ambitions and a clichéd story along with awful gameplay get in the way of it all. Also, the voice acting was really disappointing as well. Still, hopefully they learned their lesson with this game and made Two Worlds II MUCH better, but I'll be going into it expecting the worst.",

This game has a lot going for it, but it's the small things that kill it, and there are so many of them. The voice acting and writing are horrible. The horse riding is a janky pile of garbage. I think the horse only has 5 frames of animation, and it has a (somewhat deficient) mind of its own, often deciding to veer in the opposite direction you indicated. The graphics are pretty bad. I'm all for taking into account the age of the game, but there are plenty of games this old that don't look this bad. It's surprising, because some of the assets look pretty good, while others look terrible. It's like they just lumped together a bunch of assets they had sitting around. The quests are also confusing and not very descriptive. I had to look up several of them in online guides.  There are plenty more, but I stopped playing mostly because of those. It was just, plain silly. Pity, because I actually enjoyed a lot about this game. I still need to try TW2 to see if it's any better.",

The beginning is very hard you have to take your time and build up be patient, dont dive into combat or you die. learn the jump back system for defense. The horse riding is better than any rpg ive played for realism, you can shoot your bow while riding horses. The combat system is very fun once you get comfortable with the way your character moves. THere is an ingenious way to stack equipment so nothing gets wasted and items lvl as they are stacked into eachother. There are hours and hours of content and side stories. The magic system is fantastic. This was due to buggyness rated as one of the worst RPGs but infact i find its one of the best RPGS now with the patching. I prefer this game over oblivion 10 to 1. The characters are more robust. Some people complain about the voice acting but its appropriate for the setting the old english. Also its nice to hear your character talk instead of read what he says as a mute as in most games. There is plenty of element of exploration. This is a recommended must buy for anyone who likes skyrim,oblivion, gothic or any open world RPG 3rd person games. Also this game has some of the best looking armor sets ive ever seen in a game and the most veriety of weapons and items in any game to date.",

Meaning, you face the same difficulty of mobs on quests/missions regardless of your level. (random mob spawns do seem to scale with your level a LITTLE).",

A russian joined with end-gear He looked weird ♥♥♥♥ this. Exited. Shame really, as the multiplayer is pretty neat and it can make the replayabilty better, getting new gear and leveling up. Shut down the game and decided to play more tommorow.  UPDATE 2 I finally decided to play more. Here we go (this one will be shorter). I swear to god I don't know where I am. Found Jordan again. He's still an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I ran through the velociraptors. '♥♥♥♥ you too'. Found a teleporter. Got back to the ISIS guy. I was scared. I know how those reporters felt. /2soon He told me some ♥♥♥♥. Oloha Snackbar to you too my friend. Went down the road with Jordan. The song 'Tip Toeing in my Jordans' started to play. Why are there more bears here? I found some red clothed ♥♥♥♥er. He told me to find green clothed ♥♥♥♥er. Started questioning why am I still playing this? Talked to Luigi. Returned to Mario. Yeah, I know, Praise Budha... They told me they held captive my sister. Wait, I thought I worked for the ISIS? /joke2 She told me to find a node. K. Got rekt by bandits that were, half naked....... whyyyyyyyyyyyy Jordan was still an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I found the ♥♥♥♥ing node. She told me to find another node. Okay, WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ WAS THE POINT OF THIS? Decided to blow it off and do some sidequests. Foudn a random guy yelling about some random ♥♥♥♥ about the temple. I went to the first area. Used the key he gave me. Spent 15-20 minutes to lockpick 2 boxes. Got jack ♥♥♥♥. ♥♥♥♥. Moved on. While I was rolling with Jordan, I found some racists. They hated Dwarves. Because why not? A guy wanted me to help him. He didn't get his money for the last delivery of his eggs.... WHAT. HOW. WHY. Everyone, listen to this! BROTHERHOOD CAN'T PAY FOR ♥♥♥♥ING EGGS. I went to their base. Bypassed the guard that was there. He was ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Some guy wanted me to find his bro. K. I went up the hill to their REAL base. I entered a dungeon. Started to question the game design. You can't kill the skeletons. Helped the one person inside (the other one was dead). The dead one is the brother of the last num nut. The one that was alive started fighting skeletons and (I think) got killed? Dunno, I ran. Some more ♥♥♥ skeletons showed up. Went to the base and did everything. Realised the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I was hunting that didn't pay the eggs is in another ♥♥♥♥ing outpost. WHAT. HOW. WHY. Anyway, I find him. After 30 mins of looking for him. He had amazing armor and a glowing sword, I was scared. When I told him I wanted to fight him, he wanted to give me 2k (the quest giver wanted to give me 1k) so I don't kill him. He's a ♥♥♥♥♥. I kill him after 20 tries. There was a revival stone nearby. Looted his body. He had no ♥♥♥♥ing 2k on him. Went back to the quest giver. Got my 1k. Killed the ♥♥♥♥er. He can also one shot you (I see a patern with peasents) I'mtired. It's midnight. I killed him too. Looted his stuff. Killed some bandits one my way back home. Wolves came. We all got ♥♥♥♥ed. Is it over yet? I decided to take a break... ♥♥♥♥ me.  To be continued... Now excuse me while I go play Raven's Cry.  Real-ish review: I recommend this game with all my hearth. It is broken and I LOVE IT. Try it out, it is great gameplay wise, and even story wi- ahah nah, the story is just ♥♥♥♥.",

            "review_text": "Graphics: From a mere visual standpoint, this teeters on the better end of 'average'. It has common problems of its genre and time, such as touchy ragdoll physics, lackluster animations (outside of combat), foliage that appears and disappears with movement, props that frequently expose unfinished portions of themselves, and way too much bloom. Enemies also sometimes appear from thin air when I enter an area too quickly. Compounding this is an odd sort of strobe effect on movement animations, that would not look out of place in Quake, that can directly influence gameplay (especially horses, but I'll get to that later). On the flip side? The world is deceptively large, and allows for long-distance observation, by not resorting to permanent hazy filters or ridiculously short draw distance, as well as exploration, to every nook and cranny between the large mountains that make up the edges of the map. This will take the player to plenty of locales, such as mountain forests, jungles, and deserts, each of which feels atmospherically unique. Combining this with intense visual effects and minute texture detail, this is a game that can and will look stunning when it really wants to.  Sound: Aside from the simple sound effects, this game's audio is original Deus Ex tier, in both good and bad ways. Bad, in that the voice acting is pretty forced, but still tries hard to have its special charm, while delivering dialogue of a similar caliber. Good, as in the music is a combination of regular RPG ambience and stuff that's good enough to listen to outside of the game. Of course, you won't hear it unless you go to the settings menu and crank it all the way up. It seems as though somebody thought it was so embarrassing that it deserved to be hidden by generic enemy grunts and the main character's quipping, which is a shame because the music's variation, subtle undertones, strong meters, and bizarre instrumentation make it an absolute treat to listen to even when not playing.  Customization: Impressively deep, the game allows the player to toy with every aspect of his character, from looks to equipment. Armor not only includes variations by type, but variations within specific types, as well as an ability to combine identically-named equipment to produce stronger variations, and this is all on top of bonus statistics and resistances. Alchemy allows the player to brew potions and weapon upgrades from scratch. The magic system lets the player use spells that can be strengthened by adding more of the same type, using boosters, or using bonuses from other spells or pieces of equipment. This all congeals to create a character that uniquely fits the player's gameplay preferences, an experience I haven't had with this depth in a video game since Morrowind. Unfortunately, my feelings don't entirely extend to the skills list. While it is impressive to have so many skills, many of them are important parts for certain gameplay styles (the ability to silently kill enemies, for example), and some of these are locked at the beginning, requiring the player to conform to a different style until he comes across the NPC who will unlock said skill. The hotbars can also be a pain to set up.  Combat: I found the combat to work fine in one-on-one situations, but the game rarely gives those out, instead focusing on battles against hordes of enemies which are often slowly beaten using a 'one step forward, two steps backward' sort of approach that limits the depth that is readily available. Melee attacks are similar to those of the game 'Enclave', putting animation in front of effectiveness, but here the problem is ameliorated slightly due to generally being directed at enemies even without specific directional commands, and still allowing movement during said attacks. This works to hamper the combat as well, though, as I sometimes find myself accidentally ttacking allies, or using the backstep when surrounded by enemies, which will launch me right back into them. Every other approach to combat seems to supplement the melee, as it can be challenging to get the range necessary to use bow exclusively, and magic is somewhat weak for the majority of the game. Towards the end of the game, where the difficulty takes a sharp increase, the clear lack of enemy scaling sets in, and many battles will become too easy, or too hard.  Horses: Gave it its own section because of how weird they are in this game. Mounted combat works well because of the extra range given to weapons while on horseback. However, the horses themselves can be hard to control. They have a tendency to steer themselves, regardless of which direction I want to go. At first I thought it was just an elevation issue, but it's also happened over small props and pathways. The 'strobe effect' I mentioned earlier takes away some control when the horse is moving at slow speeds. Though the horse is often faster, I find myself walking on foot most of the time, because I know I can go over terrain that the horse will not.  Quests: I don't mind a little investigation, but when confronted with a locked, unpickable door, I would at least like to be pointed in the right direction to open it. While the main story offers a great deal of freedom, going so far as to tackle the objectives in any order I wish, the sidequests often required to complete these objectives (and even those that aren't required) can be hard to figure out. For most of the experience, I am left with far more questions than solutions. If I'm locked out of a faction stronghold because my reputation with them isn't high enough, can I at least be told where to find someone outside the stronghold who can increase my reputation? If I'm told to go into a cave as part of a quest, can I please open the door to get into said cave? If not, can I please be directed to someone who will give me the key? Is there a reason the NPC vital to this quest has not spawned yet? This is how the open, choice-driven quest system shoots itself in the leg. A distinct lack of explanation can make it tough to complete some of the objectives without an outside source.  Factions:  The faction system can barely be called as such. In short, it only provides small benefits that may not actually be reflective of the player's actions in the world. For example, during the Karga-Skelden section, I sided with Skelden, and had to improve my rep with them. One such required quest told me to intercept someone who was stealing documents. I was not given a location, a name, or anything else. I decided to check a guide, which told me that the NPC would only spawn if I started a certain quest for Karga. So, I go to their stronghold, and the guy at the gate tells me to get lost. Clearly, he would not let me in unless I killed him, or had increased my reputation with Karga. Out of utter indifference, I kill him, enter the Karga camp, and start the quest to spawn the NPC I need. I obtain the documents, kill the guy who had them, and keep going with Skelden's quests. Eventually, this led to Skelden wiping out the Karga stronghold completely, allowing me to walk into the deepest part of their base and take the item I needed. It was at this point that I checked my faction relations chart, and noticed that my reputation with Karga was 2/10. As far as I know, every faction relation starts at 0 and cannot go any lower. Really? 2/10? I directly caused the events that led to the elimination of Karga, and they still think I'm a 2/10 human being? Like, what did I do to deserve those points? The one quest they gave me, I betrayed them.  For its flounderings in the major categories of combat, quests, and factions, I can understand why some people don't like it. Personally, I think that the depth, customization, and scale shines through, and even though there were some moments that infuriated me, there were more than a few moments at which I sat back and felt satisfied with what it did right. Good game. Also, taint.",

If you are a person who is picky about the gameplay, AI intelligence, etc... then i would admit that this would probably make you want to play another game rather than spend time playing it.   However, If you are just looking for a game to explore an open world type of RPG and can create your own adventures without playing a linear story, then i would definitely recommend this as i had a fun time myself just doing what i wanted.   I must admit though, that the horse can be stubborn when going down certain hills or at certain edges of terrain sometimes and the game has crashed once or twice whilst i was in the middle of saving but it was one hell of an adventure. At the end of it all, for me, i found out that i could summon two times the amount of any and every creature i wanted (at least 6 types of creatures at one time though there is a max limit) whilst i was against the last boss but i think you can do the same anywhere anytime as long as you unlocked that specific water magic spell.   Overall, this was worth it for me because i did what i wanted and not had to stick to the story line to get the relic stones (I rode all the way down to the bottom of the map at the beginning and slaughtered a few bandits, dead knights, beasts and orcs along the way). I would recommend it for open world adventurers (who would just like to have fun whilst fighting unknown dangers) and first timers who are new to open world RPG games just so they can have a taste of what it's like. Also, there's no harm being the bad guy in a game and going against the rules with power in your control every now and then. :)",

            "review_text": "(NOTE) This review is dependant on having friends for multiplayer- it might not change your past experiences but give you an insight into how to get good new ones.   This game is... Bad.  So bad that the single player is entirely not worth it and beyond saving- there's no point to playing it, and as many has said before the voice acting is awful and characters not at all memorable.  But that has somehow not made this game a terrible purchase for me. You see, I bought three copies of it while on sale for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles once I saw the multiplayer tag, expecting a few hours of cheap laughter and something to bash on.  I got exactly that and more. The combat is -just barely- engaging enough to drag you in, but broken enough to be completely conquered by several players together, at low levels. I've related all the dragging and running from monsters and the fact that melee combat is awful at lower levels to being rather realistic. It's like some strange dark comedy where you run from hordes of wolves, bears, undead, grom, and ghost bears to take to the towns people who of course mob upon it and destroy it in seconds. But while doing this, you'll of course start to grow and gain more and more experience, levelling up in a sort of Dark Souls manner. In fact, the combat of the game sort of reminds me of the souls games, like a simplified version without repostes or other mechanics- but a dodge and parry button can be used, and it can be used well enough that there's a skill cap to melee combat. And you can mold your character however you want past the beginning much like in Dark Souls as well- you want to be an ice mage wearing huge armor? Sure. Sneaky necromancer who stabs people with a spear? Absolutely. It might not hold your hand and it certainly won't be fair at times but that can be forgiven with the strangely mesmeric depth of character possibilities and gameplay on several open world maps, even if you can't change their appearance to begin with past a few sliders that make no sense. For the sake of difficulty, I'd recommend starting as a magic class and then change into whatever you like later on- equipment has no restrictions except for stats and many spells just need a few points into their respective fields of magic. And somehow the game keeps things refreshing even if you lose all progress on a map when you exit the multiplayer session (you can, of course, unlock many maps through progression of the multiplayer and pick up on those irregardless) by having the enemy spawns and loot be interchangeable. One time a encampment of orcs happened to have a sand dragon instead of its usual, far over levelled and idiotic to fight. But we killed it and took its mediocre loot with a sense of accomplishment. Dying means nothing in this game as spawn points are everywhere and they heal you- but it still has managed to be fun?   The setting is easily laughable and the characters forgettable but this is a game I can find myself recommending to play with multiplayer and a few friends. It's just enough of a clone to many well known games that you can find yourself having fun while breaking and bending it to your whim. As an example, animals are afraid of many fields of fire magic and you can also easily stun lock enemies with the water magic's AOE capabilities forever, even if when they take damage they unfreeze. Me and my friend has somehow made this challenging in unexpected ways and still had fun seeking adversity. Don't take yourself seriously while playing this game- imagine it like some poorly made table top game that your little sibling/relative made to impress you but somehow manages to entertain you at the same time despite its broken aspects.   All in all, the singleplayer is worthless but the multiplayer is a surprising gem with qualities of Dark Souls, Diablo stye looting, and Oblivion small open world maps with quests to deal with. I can't recommend the full price but you absolutely should pick it up on sale for five bucks a copy- it's like a cheesy movie you'll find yourself enamored with.  Also, it charmingly included alchemy into a multiplayer game and that seems rather cool to me.   TLDR: Buy it on sale for five bucks or less to play with your friends who all have hamachi. You'll get some time of entertainment.",

It will not download for many and they provide ZERO support. I've owned it since 3/21/16 and have been trying to get help to actually install the guide for two weeks..  My new edit:  After months of trying to find help on the issue I've come to realize they screwed up on their process. When I purchased the Epic Edition they added the Strategy Guide to my library but it would not download.  When I would try putting it in my cart it would say I already owned it so I went round and round with Steam, Topware, and the forum Dev for months. BUT, now I think I understand what happened through no help from any of the support areas...  They had the purchasing part screwed up and it was giving the Guide when it should not have. The download portion however knew I didn't own it so wouldn't download it. They finally fixed it so now when I add it to my cart it no longer shows that I already own it and it no longer shows on my owned DLC page.  So, they screwed up, took months to fix it, and didn't explain ♥♥♥♥ but I won't hold it against the guide/game any longer.",

I hated it mostly because of how the graphics really weren't the best, I didn't really get the point of the game, and the voice acting was pretty bad. The thing is though, you really should not look at this game through the lens of comparing it to Skyrim, which was what I did at first. After maybe the first hour and completing a few quests you probably will start to appreciate the game and start to like it a lot. All in all, -10/10 Would highly recommend",
