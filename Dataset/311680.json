            "review_text": "My feelings on this game are kind of mixed. I feel like it could have been so much better but I still love what it has. I've played many visual novels and dating sims mainly otomes of varing qualities and backgrounds, and I always enjoyed them for something.   I'm gonna go right off in saying that the biggest isses with this game is it's length and difficulty.   It felt way too easy.   -The gardening simulation was okay but besides for getting the special endings it didn't give me any insentive to keep going once I got my goal. It's supposed to one of the big parts of the game but ends up being optional. I think this could easily be improved by adding more things to buy or atleast need money for, a higher goal for special ends and some sort of noticable punishment for not working.   -Getting the guys is another thing that felt too easy. Instead of getting hints or what not for the guys, you litterally get straight up told what stats you need to make them fall for you. It's not even sutble, they say exact stats names. another thing is there really should have been atleast one more ending per guy, and by that I mean a bad ending, so their endings wouldn't be that easy to do, mainly the special ending, which is another big problem. the 'best' ending really should be harder to get, and for some characters be better than the normal endings.   It needed more to it.  -For the guys, you either get to know them way faster than you should, or by the end you only seem to have gotten the very surface layer of them. It gives the impresstion that it was a bit rushed. Like characters who were well written out had to get their story squeezed in a much smaller amount of time, and others who weren't fully developed having to have their stories artifically stretched. While saying this I did enjoyed all the characters, but the attachment to them wasn't really there due to the rushed or shollow feeling.   -The story was good, the characters were wonderful but it was far too short. When I finished all the endings all I wanted to do was keep playing, I still do, I want there to be more for me to do. each guy took maybe an hour or two to finish completely, maybe 3 if it takes you a bit to figure out what to say. This is rather short for a game of this genre.  Now to improve these things the simple solution would be to extend the story. Add more weeks or instead of planing each week, you plan each day. or simplely adding more endings, like friendship endings for the girls and guys, bad endings. Things like this can really add an hour or so of gameplay.  - Now that we're past these issues, now to my more positive thoughts.  To start with the art is really top notch, would have been nice to have a few more CGs but moore wasn't nessasary.  The Interface is simple but it was more than enough for a dating sim.  The main character starts off not to likeable but by the end you'll deffiantly like her. She goes through a reasonable yet still drastic change, going from childish and bratty to more thoughtful of others and mature. The differant guys make these changes more sutdle or more drastic.  The other characters do go through some changes themselves that you help with, again not too great to be unrealistic but even something as simple as helping to see things a bit differantly. they do seem to evolve some in the course of the game.  The story is not really complex, you're a spoiled college girl going to a small town to work for winterbreak cause your parents are making you. It felt natural, and flowed well enough. again i wish it was longer, it would have really profited from even a slightly extended story.  Besides for technical issues, I must say that this is one of my favorite otomes, specially here on steam. If it wasn't for my dislike of playing male characters, I would most certainly try Spring in Fairbrook, aswell. If you're new to dating sims or your still not sure about this game, get it when it's on sale and give it a go.  As for the others who are still intrested, I can't really say if it's worth paying full price. If you like other Winter Wolves titles and/ or you'r fine with splurging a bit, then go for it.  ",

            "review_text": "When I started this game, I thought it would be terrible. I was disappointed with another game of Winter Wolves, Nicole, and think it was on the same line, so I just opened to get my achievements. Then, for my surprise I got involved with the game. It is not a deep game, but it's pretty cool to spend time. I found myself involved in the route of Ryan, and I was happy to see Natalie's maturity. At first I hated her, thinking she would be the same as Nicole, but she was growing up during the game, and I liked the result.   Another thing I think that was really cool: the protagonist of the previous game appear as a romance option (I had hated him the other game, but in this, his route was one of my favorites). The music is very soft and cool, the system of planting too, and in this game, different from the first, you really have a reason in order to plant and save money, if you do this you get a better ending. Another really cool thing is the game of the graph. The characters are very well made and the backgrounds are nice. It is an easy game, simple, small and cool. I have nothing to complain about it (Just the fact of being small and without much depth, but I still really enjoyed it, for me it was not something that affected much).",

            "review_text": "Flower Shop: Winter in Fairbrook is the sequel to its predecessor, Flower Shop: Summer in Fairbrook, obviously. However, instead of playing as a guy attempting to romance one of four dateable females, this time around, the player takes on the role of a female attempting to romance one of four dateable guys. As the summary of the story is already outlined in the game description, I won't repeat that here. Instead, I'll give my perspective of this game, especially comparing it to its predecessor.  Now, I found Winter in Fairbrook to be enjoyable and it definitely has longer replayability overall, as indicated by my gaming time when comparing the times of both games. I tend to play games to their full completion, making sure to get all the possible endings, achievements, etc. It has a lighter storyline generally than Summer in Fairbrook. (For those who have played Summer in Fairbrook, we're all aware that near the ending, a tragic event happens.) I did enjoy the extra scenes at the end, especially the snowball fights. The gameplay is basically the same as before. Instead of growing crops, though, the player is growing flowers. Of course, each guy has a kiss scene as well as normal and special endings, which was the same for each girl in Summer in Fairbrook.  There was something that I noticed in regards to differences. In Summer in Fairbrook, if the player earned over a certain amount of money, he/she got the special ending in which Steve (the MC) would stay on the farm. However, in Winter in Fairbrook, if the player earned over a certain amount of money, he/she would get a special ending in which Natalie (the MC) would get to be with the guy of his/her choice. However, Natalie wouldn't go back to work in the flower shop. That only happens if the player gets the normal ending. That seemed a little odd to me.  I did feel that there were some weak points in Winter in Fairbrook. There were the typos and grammar errors but honestly, I expected them to appear. However, there were certain scenes in which Natalie's expression didn't correspond to what was displayed in the text which felt a little unusual. Also, I felt that it was harder to like Natalie's character. In the beginning, she comes off as a spoiled brat who works at the flower shop only because her parents force her to get a job over winter break. Although the endings with each guy show that Natalie changes into someone hardworking, I felt that the story didn't really show that change well. There were times, like halfway through the game, where I felt that Natalie still came off as a spoiled brat. In that sense, I thought that Summer in Fairbrook did a better job of effectively portraying the change in Steve's character.  Overall, though, the game was fun to play and there's lots of replayability value. Also, I liked how the gallery was set up again so that the player can replay certain endings and scenes. I would recommend this game to anyone who's a fan of Flower Shop: Summer in Fairbrook and who likes stat building games. ^^",

            "review_text": "It was one Christmas Night, when dear Santa came to visit. He gave me a present — a game, specifically. Yes, that present was titled 'Flower Shop: Winter in Fairbrook'. I was baffled, the game was a dating sim with a female protagonist. Did Santa mistook me as a girl due to my profile picture? I felt it too sad to ignore this precious gift Santa had presented me with, and so I started playing.   The first time I played this game, it was horrible. I was irritated by the main protagonist (which is me). Why is she so airheaded? Can't she be more diligent like Susie? More attentive like Ryan or Sam? And so I skipped through the whole story and I reached the Alone Ending; pretty much the reasonable result.  From the third run, I read and followed several walkthroughs that I can find in the internet. And thus I completed 6 other Endings. But then, I realized something. I had wasted the invaluable present from Santa. The point of this game was not about tending a flower shop, nor was it to obtain more dollars in my (the protagonist's) pocket. We visited Fairbrook to have a part-time job, but that did not have to be the end of it. We met people, we met 3 handsome guys (1 was cute, instead).  And so I started anew, and I learned a lot. I learned that walkthrough was meaningless; Uncle Sam taught me all I need to get Steve's attention. I learned that it is not a General Store that increased my intelligence, it was because Ryan tutored me whenever I visited. And finally, I learned that the main protagonist is actually called Natalie. I felt happy when I reached the ending. Thank you for this great present, dear Santa.  tl;dr Flower Shop: Winter In Fairbrook is a great visual novel. And I wish you Merry Christmas 2014.",

            "review_text": "I enjoyed this one more so than it's counterpart, Flower Shop: Summer In Fairbrook Maybe because I had the male choices, or maybe because the developer seemed a little more..detailed with these characters. The achievements seemed just as tedious as the other game as well, so I would suggest going for the happier endings. The artwork as usual, was beautiful and well done. The endings seemed similar at parts, but were personalized more so than I expected.  This one however, even if it may be contradicting myself, felt rushed.  The romance came too fast in my opinion, but I suppose it was timely considering the time being over a course of weeks. Your playtime also won't reflect well with the price, for I got all the achievements in under 10 hours.  For a beginner, this is definitely a good way to start, You will get a heartfelt game with lots of love put into it, but it definitely could have had stronger points. This game was about a 6.5/10  Just for the more styled characters, they seemed less two dimensional, even though they were still quite two dimensional. But all in all, enjoyed it, the pros and cons balancing out.",
