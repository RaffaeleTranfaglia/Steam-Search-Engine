Just...such a HUGE LOVE and amazing dream! I can compare this game with one of my favourite movies 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind'. Spectacular dialogs, emotional roller coaster, great humor. And main piano theme 'For River\\To the moon' it is....I am speechless. 10 out of 10 from a sentimental dreamer.",

To the Moon is a great story, the whole game plays out like a nice movie. A few 4th wall breaking references here or there, some comic relief, and of course TONS of sappiness. I really wasn't sure what to expect going into this, but with so many positive reviews and such a neat pricetag I remained fairly optimistic, and honestly any expectations I might've had were blown out of the water by what this game really delivered. I didn't think such a story could be told in this format, I didn't know that so few pixels could make me experience so many feels..   I can't make a pros/cons list for this game really. It wouldn't really make sense. If you want to sit back and casually navigate your way through a captivating story then this game might be for you! If you're looking for a more interactive experience - or maybe want to blow some ♥♥♥♥ up - I wouldn't recommend this for you.   Honestly even if this isn't the type of game you think you'd enjoy I would still recommend waiting for a sale and giving it a shot, I spent 2$ and then one day I was in the mood for something different, and now here I am adding another thumbs up to the mountain of positive reviews this game has :)",

It's no easy feat to create a story that progresses backwards in time so that you can fully appreciate the present. The game is short, which may be a perk for some and not others. I feel the length of this game was perfect. There are many references in this game, and it's fun to find them! The sound track is beautiful and really helps influence your emotions.   This game is emotion and story driven. As for gameplay mechanics, you basically walk around (using your mouse), collecting memories so that you can progress to the next period in time. You watch this dying man's life unfold from the present until he was a young child. This is a heavy dialog game, and you have to click to go through the dialog. So walking, collecting, and dialog. Each time you progress to the next point in time, you have to solve a little puzzle. The puzzles aren't that difficult, and I found it kind of fun.   You grow to really care about the characters. You sympathise with them.   If you do not shed even one little tear at the end, you might want to have yourself tested. You may in fact not be human.",

            "review_text": "One of those 'games' with terrible gameplay but awesome storyline. The basic gist of it is that you work for a company that help dying people fulfill their wishes. In the case of the main patient in the storyline, this wish is to go to the moon. Saying any more than that would be spoiling the storyline, which is by far the main reason why you'd want to play this game in the first place.   The gameplay itself is quite mundane. It looks and plays somewhat like a 16-bit era RPG, but without combat. It's rare that you'll find yourself lost for any significant amount of time. The game is also very (written) dialogue-heavy, so if you're not a fan of reading, this probably isn't the game for you. The soundtrack is quite superb.  The game will generally take you around 3-4 hours to complete. Given the nature of the game, I would recommend completing the game in one sitting.  Overall, I personally loved this game, although I have to admit that it's not for everyone. I personally bought this for $2.50 AUD, and I thought it was worth every penny. With that said, the game has practically zero replay value and is relatively short. I would overall recommend people try the game out if they're willing to sit down and appreciate a good, touching storyline.",

            "review_text": "The gameplay is dull, linear and you won't ever have to make any decision tougher than in which order you want to click specific items. There is (or was) no controller support, the game has a few bugs, it's not always clearly visible where you can walk and where there's an invisible blockwall, and i dont know if there was even an option to change the resolution.  The interesting thing about that is though, that it doesnt matter one bit. Play the game. Don't read any more about it, avoid any information about it as well as possible, and for goudas sake, do yourself the favor and dont watch a let's play. You would regret it forever.  This game is about its story and the feelings it conveys, made possible as well by the charming artstyle and the perfect soundtrack, which now is finally available as FLAC, which is actually the reason I'm writing a review now, the soundtrack alone is worth way more than anyone ever paid for it. And one has to experience it by oneself, it would be a terrible waste to know that much about it, that there's nothing to experience anymore. Or to say it like this: If i had the chance to forget all of it, so i can replay and experience it all over again, i'd do it.  Of course, it won't be everyones kind of game, I know some Idio-... people who think: 'If i want to read a story, i can read a book, i don't have to play a game for that', but at least to me, games are way more personal. Even if you don't really have many choices, you still get more involved, by moving around in the world which the game is presenting to you, and experiencing it at your own pace, in your own way.  In my admittedly kinda dull NEET-life, where every day is basically like the last, the next, or any other for that matter, I always forget what i did at some point, as there is just nothing special about it. But i can remember one of those days clearly. I remember sitting in my room (well, as always), tucked in a blanket, drinking rooibos tea. It was evening outside, later even night, and it was snowing with the snow lying around 6-8centimeters high. I still had some peels lying next to my screen, from the clementines i ate earlier that day, and they and the rooibos distributed a comfortable fragrance throughout the room. And i remember all this for one reason only. It was the day that i played To the Moon.",

PROS   ~The story* ~Characters (although most info on the protagonists will be found in the minisodes) ~The art   (*) The story is good , but not great. Fans of the game may say it is 'GENIUS' but in my opinion there was no genius plot element or twist, it was a a good and nice story and that`s all.    CONS   ~The controls* ~The humor**  (*) The characters` movements feel 'slidey' . I think the maps are made on a grid pattern so if you use a keyboard you might stop pressing the key but the character will keep moving to the end block , it creates a 'slidey' feeling and puts me kinda off. You can of couse you can use a mouse so it`s up to you , I prefer keyboard and the keyboard didn`t feel right. (**) The humor feels forced and cringey. Dr.Watts for example constantly makes jokes and puns, I think they are intentionally written bad and cringey but I think it was unnecessary.    I personally suggest you try it, you will probably like it. 7/10",

To The Moon is one of the few that does an outstanding job in not only nailing this, but also leaving a long-lasting impact.  Without revealing too much to those that have yet to play - You assume control of two Doctors – Dr. Neil Watts and Dr. Eva Rosalene – whom work for an agency whose job is to reconstruct certain aspects of dying people's memories and fulfil their deepest wishes before their lights are out; in this case, taking Johnny to the Moon. The reason to which I will not explain in this review, otherwise there would be no point in going through all the emotions this game sets out to deliver. Though you can expect a story filled with excellent dialogue and character development with plenty of unpredictable moments  Gameplay is fairly straight forward and pretty much the same as TWD or any point-and-click game for that matter. There are a few mini-games and puzzles to add that little challenge factor but nothing overly complicated or mind numbing. Everything is straight forward and easy to pick up.  The soundtrack is composed to perfection and aids the storytelling in a very unique way. A great mixture of tracks which change depending on the scenario at hand.  The only aspect that may throw some people off is the fact that there is almost zero replayability, with the average completion time appearing to be anywhere around the 4.5 hour mark. Unless of course certain aspects of the game did not sink in properly the first time and you attempt a second rerun, though this does not bother me at all as it aimed to convey a purpose right from the beginning and was delivered to great satisfaction.   Overall a wonderful game I would very strongly recommend. Do not let the simple graphics fool you! Deep down tears will be shed playing this little blockbuster.",

The story, in my opinion, is the biggest highlight of the game, followed by the sweet soundtrack. It manages to be both really clever and moving, and the textual dialogue within the game contains that quality to it that I absolutely love, which is the one that brings emotion and personality into the written words. The one that makes the characters sound more human, and that familiarity with them renders them very emotionally potent; a kind of emotional truth that we experience at a biochemical level quite the same as we would with strangers whom we get to know with time.  I suppose that the only one I genuinely have with the game is the fact that it only runs on 640x480 in Windows. While the art is still very good, it's a shame that it's not possible to experience the game in bigger resolutions. The lack of an options menu for that is an issue, and it's bad that the Steam overlay doesn't work with the game as well. Albeit, as usual with other RPG Maker games, the game's properties and settings can be easily accessed by pressing F1. Those can be used to alter the game's controls, in case the player isn't satisfied with them. They're smooth and easy to learn, however.  Any gamer that loves games that are story driven must have this in their library.  To The Moon  contains a heartwarming narrative, good characters, fine art, and a wondrous soundtrack. This is something to be paid attention to. It's simple, yet powerful. It's short, but gripping. It's part of why it's as impressive as it is.

You play as two doctors Eva and Watts who are traversing through the memories of a dying patient who's final wish is to go to the moon. I won't reveal any more to the plot because it's much better you sit through the events of the story yourself. It's tearjerking; everyone's review that says this truly means it. I didn't understand the story fully the first time mostly out of the fact that I didn't exactly understand the side-effects of some medical conditions mentioned throughout the game, Google anything you're unfamiliar with; it'll help you out, but after the 2nd time it finally made sense, and when you DO understand every piece of the story, it just hurts in a satisfying, remorseful way. There's no easy way to put it; if you don't feel ANYTHING at the end of the gorgeous ride the game takes you through, you're unbelievably heartless.  If stories that certainly make you appreciate life and not take it for granted, and a hint of science fiction is your cup of tea, To The Moon does anything but disappoint. The piano-arranged soundtrack is stunning; I still find myself humming the themes 3-years later, the 16-bit graphics are nice, and the mini-puzzles inbetween are a lovely touch to keep you going. I'm super excited for Kan Gao's next installment to the series 'Finding Paradise' later this year, but for now I will continue to love this game to no end.  Thanks, Kan.",

The fact that from times to times some ridiculously easy puzzles have to be solved in order to progress doesn't exactly make it a game. There's nothing challenging about it.  Anyway, its best part is the story. It's a complex story that treats matters of life and death in such way that it gets to be felt quite close and personal. I completely don't recommend this to depressive people. I was on the verge of busting into tears several times throughout its duration. The story is great, very touching and impactful. It's hard to speak about it without spoiling it, but I guess I could say it somehow reminds of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, the movie, but only in just a few aspects.  Other than the story (but damn, what a story!...), there was nothing I liked about how 'To the moon' presented itself to me. The soundtrack supports the story pretty well, it enhances the feelings that the story transmits, but it gets cheesy at points, near the end. Don't get me wrong, it's an awesome soundtrack that clearly shows the loads of work it required, but it's just not my type, I'm more into the Bastion-like soundtracks.  Many people seem to have found the strength to tolerate the awful graphics, but I still can't ignore them. It's an 'RPG Maker'-like, uber low budget kind of graphics that ruined for me the immersiveness of the 'to the moon' experience at points. Since the clicking and controlling was also quite imprecise, I think I would've even prefered a slideshow of still images instead of some of the scenes where just moving around was pretty annoying and tedious.   It also lacks basic settings like sound volume controls, full screen / window mode toggling, screen resolution settings, all the basic stuff. At least it comes with steam cloud support and a pretty neat, single 'Steam achievement'.  Anyway, I don't regret the money spent on it and the 3 hours and a half that it took me to finish it. It's a great experience. It's also, indeed, worthy of still being considered the saddest game of all. I submit to this general opinion as well.",

You control the characters Dr. Wyatt and Dr. Rosaleane, scientists within a wolrd in which it is possible to recover memories of their dying patients for a chance to live their final requests and dreams - even if it was not reality and only in their minds.   'Occasionally I'm fortunate enough to play a game that reminds me what's important. Not only what's important in making a great piece of interactive media, but also what's important in life.' - Anthony Gallegos  This story centers around a dying man named Johnny who wished to visit the moon, hence the games title.. To the Moon. Along the way of recovering Johnny's memory a wonderful story of love, and loss unfolds before your eyes. As you progress through layers of memories Johnny will slowly go from being an unconscious old man you don't really care about, to a complex human being whose life you are certain the empathize with. By the end of the game I came to care about Johnny, despite never meeting his 'real' self in the overworld.   The gameplay consists of simple puzzles in order to break through layers of memories and then comes to exploring the memory and watching the story unfold. In other words if you are someone who's interested in fancy graphics and gameplay this isn't for you.  My weak puzzle solving skills and exploration are not why I have 4 hours in this game, I rather rushed through these parts in order to reach the next scene or dialogue sequence allowing me sight into the minds and hearts of the characters presented. Some games are mindless and are carried through the repetitive actions, gameplay and graphics. To the Moon is reliant on the excellent plot of which will leave you broken.",

Being a huge fan of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, I purchased this game simply because of the parallels I had heard about, and I was not disappointed. As I played, every new discovery left me compelled to uncover more and to find out about the old man's life. At times the dialogue can be a bit silly, but it's much needed comedic relief within a setting that otherwise jumps from tearjerking to heartwarming.  The gamplay is extremely basic, and whilst it is more present than any gameplay in Gone Home, for example, I would still put this in the 'interactive novel' genre as at its core it is simply a story you are uncovering. There are occasionally small puzzles to jump between memories, but I personally found that these became tedious fast and I feel the game would be better without. They do, however, add a little more pacing to the plot and give you some time to think about what you may find next.  To The Moon is definitely worth buying, I can't imagine anyone being disappointed by such a rollercoaster ride. I am extremely excited to see what Freebird release next!",

            "review_text": "I honesty didn't know what this game was about. From one of the screen shots in the store page I somehow expected a RPG. It is not.  Gameplay-wise this 'game' does not have a lot to offer. You collect items through some restricted areas, resolve a puzzle and jump to the next area. It's not the game's strong suit. This is not about gaming, not in the most literal sense anyway.   This 'game' is all about its story. It plays like an interactive movie.  Like many have said before me, it would spoil the whole thing to go into details on why the story is so poignant. And it's also hard to put into words. Think “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind”.  It is true that this game is all about experience, because, well, it’s about navigating through one person’s history, memories, emotions. The more you dig into that life, the more you uncover some truths. Some feel very wrong, other absolutely great, but the whole process never ceases to feel incredibly intrusive.  This is one of those story where you’re not sure where it’s headed before being close to the end. You don’t really know why that specific objective has been set (having a dying old man go to the moon), you just know you have to get there.  If I were to explain what happens during the big reveal, I would probably make it sound cheesy. But not this game. The execution is great and unravels the missing pieces at the perfect moment. (I’m thinking about the star-gazing scene, for those who are wondering, not the... hum... reverse-engine one)  Once you have reached that point, the rest of the story was pretty much predictable in my opinion, but I still enjoyed it very much. I put on my cry baby suit and didn't stop until the end, or rather 10 minutes after I closed the game.  The conclusion both feels utterly wrong and completely right, and is endearingly beautiful.  You know these movies/books/games/songs that leave you bewildered, happy and sad at the same time? And the feeling lingers on for the rest of day? This is one of them: it has one of the most heartfelt stories I have experienced, up there with the movie I mentioned earlier, Shadow of the Colossus and the likes.  ♥♥♥♥ing play this game.",

What a unique game, I'm very foutunate to use my hard earn money to give this game a shot and what I got back was mixed emotions; as I laughed, cried, smiled, frowned, and all other possible humane facial expressions out there. All because of a typical RPG game running for 4-5 hours about John's or  Joey's  life.    Joey.....   Those types of scenes, I couldn't believe that any one espically an indie gaming company can come up with these occurances that can really hit you in the feels. Knowing that John would die at any moment + Eva and Neil doing their job and making sacrifices to fulfull John's last wish + John's childhood + The soundtrack (espically the piano instrumentals and Laura Shigihara's voice of an angel) + The reoccuring rude remarks of Neil + Eva having to deal with all that....  and +...    River....  She was basically the icing of the cake in this game for her unique character... As she was limited by her autism, she really made her life complete in both reality and in John's visions. Their relationship is what made this game the most relatable, two different backgrounds and personalities; as they ended up living through the moments together through childhood to death and John's decision to change his memories before he leaves his life, really completed the couple.

I'm so glad I did. **The reason my hours are shorter than most is because it was played on offline mode most of the time** The story is unique with many plot twists. The company doesn't put too much work into gameplay because it's the story you are supposed to focus on. If you expect it to be a full shooting and destroy everything game, you'll get a few puzzles for your enjoyment. You play as Johnny and has a very quiet wife, and although she doesn't say much she is one of the most loving characters in the game. The graphics are also quite nice in an indie way. You CANNOT play this game in long breaks, it's one you'd want to continue and even if you didn't, the ending is cute so go play to the end anyways. I've recommended this game to three people so far, and all three love and enjoyed it as much as I did. It's simplistic gameplay with a strong story makes one amazing game.",

It has some really interesting and totally unexpected plot twists. The characters are likeable, you can get attached to them. It also has some awesome references that I'm pretty sure everyone loves. Music is also great.  Now, there are some small mistakes like I wanted options in the game. On fullscreen the game was slightly to the left, resulting in a black area on the right, wanted to switch resolution to solve the problem. The game also a bit loud, being able to control the volume would be nice. Controls are a bit clunky. Other things I didn't like. There are some holes in the story, I feel there are parts that requires explanation, things that the game doesn't tell you, where I feel it's necessary. I also don't get emotionally attached to River and John, at least not much. I honestly do not believe that they loved eachother. River was cold all game not even caring about Johns feelings, and I think she is selfish, while I don't think John really loved River, looking at the not looking up the illness of River, the girl was just a person who is not like everyone else for John. Since I felt no real love between them, I couldn't really grew to them. The story itself is emotional, but mainly because of the two doctors. I built up emotions, I wanted to cry but I couldn't. I'm not attached to John and River, so I'm not really touched by their death, despite the fact that I'm insanely emotional and it's easy to get me crying.  Anyhow, all in all, the story is not bad, if you can buy that the two of them loved eachother, you are going to enjoy it a lot more than I did. It's not a Professor Layton: Unwound Future(the story that touched me the most), but it worths that 4 hours it requires to play it through.",

The one thing I'd like to note about the game is that it's primarily controlled with the mouse (although there are some sections that use the keyboard). Using the mouse for movement is unfamiliar and may feel weird at first, but after a few scenes you'll more than likely get used to it and thus it becomes a non-issue.   One last thing I'd like to say is that if you do choose to delve into the fantastic story that is  To the Moon , be sure you have something ready to wipe your eyes with nearby.

Keep an open mind going in and you should be fine.  - Play it in one sitting. It's a short game! Think of it like a movie; you'll want to finish it in one sitting or it just won't have the same impact on you.  - Turn off other distractions. The musical score is fantastic, and even necessary in setting the mood of the game. If you're the type to listen to your own music collection, a gaming stream, friends on Skype, or what else have you while playing games, turn it off just this once. You'll be glad you did.",

Here's the best way to describe the story --- it is a mix of the movies 'Inception' and 'The Notebook' illustrated through Super Nintendo graphics.  As many others have noted in their reviews, 'To the Moon' is for a very specific audience. Do not come into it thinking it will have great game play, state of the art graphics, or 40+ hours of play time with replayability. This is more of an interactive movie experience; there are elements of point-and-click game play involved, but nothing that will make your brain swell or raise your blood pressure. If you do not care for emotional/inspirational/romance movies, this also may not be for you.   With all that being said, if you come into 'To the Moon' expecting what it is, you will not leave disappointed. It is a complex journey that shares the power of the human spirit, illustrated through one man's life (from childhood to his death bed) and his pursuit of dreams versus love, and overcoming regret and loss.   It's a sobering reminder that many of us will lay in a death bed some day (whether old age, accident, cancer, etc.) and the questions will be...will you be at peace, or will you question everything that was your entire life? It's also a simple reminder to enjoy the simple joys in life with the ones you love with what time you are given with them.  'To the Moon' was a great piece of art that I was glad to experience.",

The only other game close to meeting that description is Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, but that game requires more effort than To the Moon, and therefore does not get 'simplest.' Nothing else that I've played has really gotten near these attributes.  I went into this game expecting it to be highly overrated. My main reasoning for that is because I have played many RPG Maker games before, years and years back, and never found any to be really great. Therefore, I was extremely surprised to hear this RPG Maker game getting so much praise almost universally, for so long.  And surprise hit me again when I realized how much I agreed with everybody else. To the Moon has very great artistic style for something made in RPG Maker. The maps are simple but very well-made, with lots of thought in organization and layout. The characters actually have nice movements to fit their actions. The animations and designs work with the premise of the story - all are done well.  The story itself, so unexpectedly emotional. Learning about the old man in reverse time is, theoretically, a simple idea in such a sci-fi / futuristic type of story, but it was so efficiently planned. There are so much questions that pop up along the way, and as you slowly get your answers, they just make you feel more attached to the story, to the characters, despite only being invested in them for a few hours. Every little 16-bit person seems like they are real. They seem more natural than many people I've ever seen in such a simple video game.  The music and sound fit in so well with all of their scenes, and only serve to help the emotions you get as you play. It all made me smile, laugh, get angry, want to cry - you name it. The ending of the game and the song played there... I think many people have gone to listen to the soundtrack long after playing this game, and I understand why.  As I said, the game is the 'simplest' - and really, it is a story. You have control of the characters; you explore to learn; you solve puzzles to continue. But the game does not require much effort to keep moving, and in many ways, it makes sense that this choice was made. The story would not be so touching if you had to spend a lot of time trying to get past difficult puzzles, as you would only get more angry at the game itself.  I definitely wish that I could experience this game again, without knowing anything about it. But of course that is not possible... unless Neil and Eva were to help me out.",

Now, there are many other reasons why I love this game, but one of the biggest reasons I fell in love was because of one character; River.   River is a girl diagnosed with Autism much later in her life, unlike those who are usually diagnosed as a child. Due to River's socially awkward and obsessive behavior over certain objects and the lack of ability to understand social norms her symptoms come off as believable and realistic. As someone with autism I am extremely happy to see an autistic character protrayed so well. I found myself to relate more so towards another autistic character by the name of Isabelle. Isabelle is a friend of River's, describing herself as an actress, because she's been raised to appear neurotypical. I found myself relating a lot to River and Isabelle, two characters that I absolutely adore.

People were saying 10/10 best game ever, and I was like 'there's now way this rpg maker game is a 10/10.' I was wrong. This game has very little actual gameplay, so don't come in expecting that. Rather, it is musically and narratively driven. This is one of those games that is so intriguing that you think about it for days, weeks, years after you play it. The story is just fantastic, and the music is superb. The only con I would list for this game is that the dialogue for the scientists is pretty cringy. Nevertheless, the story and the music blows that minor complaint out of the water for a solid 10/10 and one of my favorite games ever. BUY THIS GAME. SHARE THIS GAME. PLAY THIS GAME.",

            "review_text": "This game is so very touching. It's not realistic or logical (but it's not meant to be either).  It plays like a dream. Imagine how dreams can be rather senseless and illogical, but have that special, mystical feeling to them?   Well, that is how this game feels like.  This is not to say that the story doesn't make sense, because it does (for the most part).  So the story takes off with a patient (i.e. Johnny) at old age - on his deathbed - and wanting to fulfil his desire of going to the moon.  But how on earth is a man of such age to achieve such a thing?  Well, that's where a brilliant duo of doctors (aka Dr. Neil Watts &amp; Eva Rosalene) come in.  They specialize in the art of memory-alteration, through use of a sophisticated machine, which is then connected to a patient's head - via a helmet - so as to grant them access to their patients' memory and alter their memories (as needed).  The game is played in a chronological, linear fashion (meaning, there's a certain routine to follow), which involves hopping from memory to memory, by interacting with mementos (i.e. items of sentimental value to the patient) which serve as a 'bridge' between one memory and the next &amp; triggers the time-travelling process, within the patient's mind.  It's interesting to note however, that time-travel occurs in a backwards fashion (meaning, as you play you get to see the patient at old age first, and then hop back in time to a younger version - again &amp; again - till a certain age is reached).  This is done for the purpose of creating a point of 'ignition' (in regard to Johnny's end-life desire of 'going to the moon'), meaning; the two doctors look for an ideal timeframe within Johnny's past to alter his memories, so as to encourage the fulfilment of his dream.  Mementos (encountered within the patient's mind) have to be 'activated' in order for them to serve as a 'link' to a specific memory.   This is achieved by touching them &amp; going thru a process of solving a mini-puzzle.  The puzzle is of the 'tile'-type (where tiles are flipped in a methodical way so as to have them form an image - this is always an image of whichever memento is being worked on at that moment).  Also; these mementos are wrapped inside a protective bubble and have to be 'released' thru a certain mechanism, which is achieved thru the collection of so-called 'orbs' scattered across any area (i.e. school, home, yard, etc., ... ) that is up for exploration within the patient's mind.  Whether or not Johnny's dream is eventually achieved is left for the player to find out at the end of the game (no awful cliffhanger there, phew!).  The way the story ends, does make way for yet another episode (and hopefully this will be the case!).  There was such clever use of sound, music and words that created a beautiful experience and atmosphere maintained throughout the whole game.  Admittedly... it had me crying. The music, the story... the characters. Ahh... I love when a game has that effect on me - that's why I ultimately play - to have a good time. And I sure did!  NB I played this game with a Steam buddy and that impacted my experience positively (it's one of those games that serves as a great way to bond and share the many 'feels' evoked by the story).  UPDATE - NOMINATION:  This game should be nominated because:  - the plot in itself is very endearing (i.e. clever use of sound, music, scenarios) - the plot unfolds in a very original manner - it touches upon real-life issues with a fun sci-fi twist - gets you thinking about life, stimulates the mind &amp; pulls quite a bit of heartstrings!",

While the story is emotional, dealing with a husband's struggles in living with a wife with a mental condition, there was one thing with the writing that kept bothering me...the doctors.  They pulled me out of the story almost every time they interacted. From snarky banter, to pop culture references, to pointless 'mini-games' involving    zombies??!   . I think they weren't written with the same serious tone as the rest of the story.  There is a major twist towards the end that I suppose is there to pull your heart strings, but there was no real build up to it and was in a completely different direction then where I thought the story was going.    I thought Anya was going to be a lost child, which would have suited the build up more and been a great cataclyst for River's change in condition.     I must say that you should complete this in one playthrough to get the impact of the story. I can see someone missing the emotion if they left the game and came back later to finish it.  I recommend people play this as it is a decent story. For a little more then the cost of a movie ticket and time to devote to it (it's 4 hrs long), it's something to experience, but I wish the writers had made the script hold up as maturely as the material.

So, this is a story, I should be reviewing that then. Well I don't want to give anything away about the ending, or should I say beginning since it's told in reverse? It's a slight love story, one of small coincidence, endurance through hardship and personal tragedy. It's not life changing or all that original, but if you have a shred of empathy and compassion then you will probably enjoy it. It's unclear whether the player has any control over the outcome, but I saw no point at which this was likely so there is no replay value.",

This random blip of completely unknown origin is by far the most emotionally driven game I've ever played in my entire life. Captivating, devastating, heart warming and soul shattering... This game tugs on the strings that is the human condition. The wonder that is each and everyone of us, and just how fragile we all really are. Fleeting, circumstantial, This game took it all on and I will confess to being emotionally overwhelmed... But in the best of ways. The story will take a hold of you and won't let go even long after you've completed the game. It's inconceivable to think that the majority of people will overlook this game.  Simply amazing, utterly groundbreaking. Ratings usually are a sum of their copy and paste criteria. Gameplay, visuals, etc etc... I'll be straight with you. The gameplay is little more than clicking on the screen to move your character. The visuals resemble something you'd see on early SNES. This isn't an adhd fix. This isn't an innovation in the mechanics of gaming. This is an interactive story that is relevant to every person on the planet right now. I believe strongly that you have to be in the right state of mind to jump into this game.. Even if just to buy it and keep it in your library of games. Leave yourself a reminder. Ever few days or so.. Until you feel like jumping into it. Stick with it and you'll be appalled at how studios with millions of dollars make it seem like gaming as a whole deserves to be phased out... While some random unheard of indie developer crafts a story and works 20 year old visuals to portray emotions that belittle everything the modern industry shovels out.   Do yourself a favor. Don't read reviews and don't look at the genre and scoff. Play the game. Experience what I'm trying to explain to you. You won't regret it.",

            "review_text": "In a nutshell, 'To the Moon' is the story of two doctors looking to fulfill the wish of a dying man named Johnny. His wish is to go, you guessed it, to the moon. The problem with that is he doesn't know why and it's up to the two doctors to find out and they do this by going into his memories. I won't spoil any of the plot for you but the journey is one well worth taking. I wouldn't exactly call 'To the Moon' a game per se. You basically look around the level for fragments of a memory which trigger a memento that helps you reach the next memory. After you trigger the memento, you have to do some light puzzle solving. Sometimes, you will have to do other things but this is the definiton of a casual game. There's no time limits, no right or wrong way to do things and you WILL eventually fulfill Johnny's wish to get to the moon. That's why I'd call this more of a visual novel than a game. The story is really what sucks you in. It's almost a nuisance to go through the gameplay because you just want to find out what happens. And I will say, this game about 80% in throws you a massive curveball I didn't see coming. Like System Shock 2 - SHODAN type curveball. Overall I'd recommend 'To the Moon' for it's wonderful story of love and loss and the superb soundtrack. Yes, you can loosely call this a 'game' but it's definitely worth a playthrough if you enjoy good stories. 7.5/10 from me.",

It's an extremely emotional game, if you pay attention to the story (Which is a must, if you wish to enjoy the game). While it is a rather sad story, the game doesn't leave you alone and sad as the two characters that discover the story are very close and understand each other. They often bicker and it ends up as a perfect mix between story, emotion and humor. I found it extremely enjoyable.  The soundtrack is also brilliant! It gets a little repetitive if you spend to much time in one area but other than that, the detail in the audio of the game (Including sounds) is of a high quality.  My recommendation: If you haven't got this game yet, make sure to add it to your 'To-Play' list. It really is a story worth hearing.",

To the Moon is an incredible game. The story is about two scientists who have the technology to access peoples memories, and use this technology to grant people their final wish on their death bed. It's an interesting premise, and it works so well. The patient that is dying is Johnny Wyles. His last request is strange...to go to the moon. The scientists need to go into his earliest memories and plant an idea - or thought - of going to the moon. This is where the story starts to unravel. You learn about Johnny's past memories, like his wife River and her condition, and his friends in school. The story is just amazing, and is the first game that made me cry this much. The story is so good because of the emotional impact on the player. This is a game I will remember for years to come. Not to mention the whole game is accompanied by a beautiful soundtrack! Not everything is perfect though, like the controls being a bit unresponsive at times, but with everything else in the game that is good, it's easy to overlook these minor gripes. The game also has a great 16bit art style. I never knew that a 16bit game would make me bawl my eyes out, and even though the dialogue is all text, there is still so much emotion. There are some sections of comedic relief that are pretty funny, and some very tense and gripping moments as well. Anyways, To the Moon is one of the best games I have played in the past few years even if it's not really a game. (Since it's really all about the story). 10/10",

Just don't expect to cry your eyes out and be traumatized forever, as some people on the internet would have you think. It's a nice and clever story, there's not much to do as long as gameplay goes, but as it usually happens in this kind of games, this should be considered more as an alternative way to tell a story than a proper game. An interactive story, you could say. The writing is funny, the OST is extremely well done and catchy, and since I also like olives and platypuses, I definitely recommend To the Moon.   If playing a localised version (thank you devs for having the game translated!) be aware that you'll have to change the language to English and play again through the last scene in order to get the achievement. Oh, and don't forget to play the two free DLC (a.k.a mini-sodes). They're a nice free addition, though I really hate cliffhangers and every single ending has one. And the mini-sodes should have been included somehow directly in the menu of the main game. The way they are currently implemented is quite sloppy and I believe this wouldn't be that hard to fix. Despite all this, To the Moon is a nice story worthy of a playthrough... a great story, yes, but still not quite what I would call a  game .

To The Moon is more than a game. It's an experience. Watching playthroughs isn't the same as playing the game. The gameplay isn't really long at all, it took me about 6 hours to complete it on my first play around. (Literally, like I watched Cryaotic play this game, and cried. I bought the game myself... AND STILL CRIED) I still love it. The story will never get old to me. It's unique, unheard of, emotional, everything a great game has. Most people think this game is boring because all you do is solve puzzles and walk around. No. Just no. Those people aren't actually enveloped in the feels and the emotion of the game.   To The Moon has one of the BEST storylines in a game that I have ever played. To The Moon is for everyone. Literally. It also has those funny moments that Watts brings in. Now that there's Steam Cards, replay is going to be helpful. Get ready to get hit in the feels once again.  This is, without a doubt, beauty and perfection in their final forms. Simply stunning. The original soundtrack is also perfect and makes you feel even more. We're all in this together people... The feels on the bus go round and round...  Kan Gao has made a MASTERPIECE. And I can't wait for Episode 2 to be finished. Keep a look out for A Bird Story. It's a prequel to the second patient in the series. Check Freebird Games website often for chances to get limited edition items from To The Moon and get updates about the new upcoming game A Bird Story.  10/10",

GG, no life. --------------------------------------------------------------------- WARNING:Possible implied spoilers (will try my best not to give out major ones)  !$@!$#$%#$ Where do I start? I felt like going on an indie game spree today, so I started off with the swapper then I end up here. 'To the Moon' is most emotionally compelling game I've ever played, and that says a lot for 3 hours (other time spent afk), nothing compares to what this game gave in such a small amount of time. Don't let the $10 price tag fool you, if you can read I can assure you you'll get your money's worth 10 folds.   Although I've nitpicked 'The Swapper' for it's lack of a challenge, 'To the Moon' sets the bar so high I won't even dock points for it's simplicity(really, unless you can't read, there's no reason at all not to buy this game). For 'emotionally compelling', I can defintely say this game leads closely towards the sad side. Kan Gao beautifully inserts questions into your mind while consistently lets you find out the answer for yourself, along this sea of grief, he seamlessly inserts halarious comic reliefs, such as the joke Final Fantasy styled battle at the beggining of the game (there really is no legit fighting).   Although I'd like to type more, It would end up with me giving major spoilers. As a note towards the ending, it's a little controversial and I'd agree that it could of been a little different in the audience's favor, in the end there's no denying that it's still extremely well done (along with the mind ♥♥♥♥ if you pay attention during the bridge scene and at the end of the credits). Coincidentially, I happen to be playing this game a week after it's successor, 'A Bird Story' was released a week ago, it happens to be more story oriented and I will be looking foward to getting it with high expectations (not of that which compares to To the Moon however, we've seen this happen before and it does not end well with fans.)  Overall, one of my first legit reviews (You need to upvote my other ones, like now) 10/10. (11/10 if the movement was perfected --- that's really the only con for me)  EDIT: Can't believe I left off the part that contributed the most to the story--- THE MUSIC, transitioned well throughout the whole game",

Move around, click on objects to fill your quota before you can move on to the next stage. With effective pixel art and a beautiful sound track, it's a feast for all senses.   A short but sweet game for evening.  The only annoyances I had, were some trouble with resolutions and the hotspots for items were sometimes small and unreliable - which meant revisiting rooms because you missed something that didn't show up in your mouse scans. Steam overlay refused to work as well, and for my particular setup, alt-tabbing out caused it to misbehave. None of these issues are severe enough for me not to recommend it though.",

It's such a beautiful game -- nothing I'd expect out of a game I'd never heard of before its sale.  As for controls, the movement with clicking can be a bit annoying, but it's really no big deal. The puzzles are easier than I thought they'd be. I don't think going for the 'ideal' amount of moves on all the puzzles does anything significant, so no need to be stubborn like I was and keep trying to find the ideal move order.   The soundtrack for this game is amazing. After launching the game for the first time, I was awed by the main menu track and knew it'd be well worth my time even if it were just for the music. Throughout the game, the soundtrack worked well to produce an appropriate atmosphere, as the soundtracks were very nice and fitting.  TLDR: I can't recommend this game enough.

The various parts of the game were interwoven brilliantly.  The music, and the attention given to their placements, as well as the sound effects, was amazing.

It's because even though the game may be under 2 hours, the impact it will have on you will be lifelong. They could have charged full price ($59.99) for this game and it would still be more than worth it in my opinion.  This game is a fantastic example of emotionally moving narrative. 9/10 people will cry at the end of the game (myself included).

Most areas require you to find 5 items to move you on to the next area, but honestly it's all just there to break the plot up and to give you a chance to look around the nice environments. Plus, the occasional video game in-joke stops the subject matter from ever being too depressing. Characterisation of the two leads is very entertaining, would happily play a sequel with the same central concept and characters.  P.S. For those who have already played (or, should you buy and complete it...) there is a special 20 to 30 miniute long holiday themed bonus section.

The only things that might get in the way of the story are the simple graphics and the puzzles. In my opinion, however, the graphics don't take away from the story at all, but rather help keep the focus on the story. The puzzles do distract from the story some, but there are few enough of them and they're simple enough that they don't detract from the story much.  Overall, To the Moon is an incredible game.

The adventure-typical riddles are hardly present at all, the few mini games need few skill, and the handling by mouse needs some adjustment. Luckily the story makes more than up for such shortcomings. A tale of a fulfilled life, that lacks one last wish. A tragic tale of loss and burdens, that make life what it is. A lovers tale, shown in touching sensitivity. Lightened up through occasional snarky comments by the protagonists. These days, many games strive to build a movie-worth story, while not reaching even halfway decent results. This one gets close. Enjoy it as a piece of slightly interactive fiction.

It was a huge success in storytelling, with story twists every and a large variety of emotions conveyed. There were no loose ends or unexplained mysteries that were not solved in the end (except for one deliberate cliffhanger after the credits). The world was immersive and made sense. Every character had a set backstory and had much to be learned about. On top of all this, the soundtrack is absolutely immersive, one of the best since...well...ever. Up until now the Halo franchise has held this spot.  Of course, I'm not just some fanboy ranting on all the positives. For one, the gameplay was a bit repetitive for about 3 quarters of the game (it livened some towards the end) but this was most likely to put more focus on the narrative. Still, would've been nice to see deeper interaction. The scenery was lovely, but apparently small tufts of grass or flowers are just as tall as a lighthouse because I could walk through neither, which got very frustrating seeing how the landscape was littered with flowers. Turned into a maze wherever I walked. And with all RPGs, the movement was a bit sticky, being based off of a grid-like moving system.   But for a game like this, I could almost call it a work of art. For those looking for a relatively quick sit-down and want a deep story experience, this is your game.   I rate 10/10 moons.",

Your objective is to venture the mind of an old man and fulfill his wish to go to the moon by making him think so in his sleep. Seems simple? No, it's way more complex that. You will fall in love and bond with every single character, this game will teach you how important 'time' is. If you are looking to cry the hell out of manlihood, you can buy this for a mere 10 bucks. A game this stupendous is worth 20 bucks even when it is 4 hours long. This is one of those things that are capable of changing your life. This game teaches you that there is a place for every choice you make, no matter how small it is, you might be an astronaut rather than a teacher if you went to the coffee shop this tuesday instead of wednesday. You are either finishing this crying, or finishing this crying and a changed man. Truly an adventure no one should miss. 10/10 &lt;3 Does this game offer good gameplay? No. Good controls? Heck no!

It feels as if the author knew the destination for their story, but didn't put enough effort into how the characters would get there.  The music does all the heavy lifting. Due to the terrible dialogue, the game relies on the amazing soundtrack to carry you through the story beats. This is the biggest strength of this game because the music completely nails every setpiece. I'm confident if they removed every line of dialogue from this game, used only emotes and sprite work, this would be a knockout.  The controls are frustrating. Since you are really just walking around in this game, easily moving your character around should be a top priority.

The click and find with a puzzle between each section works very well. It's sentimental, but so good.  I'm going to say something controversial. I'm really tired of blocky pixel art and the retro style. There's nothing wrong with retro styling and pixel art, but too many view them with rose tinted glasses and there is an excess of it in the indie/budget land. Cell shaded 2-D graphics can work really well, look at Braid, Bastion, Spelunky as examples. Cutesy is fine too, but a fair few games out there seem to end up with characters so blocky that it's hard to care. This game does a little more with the graphics and the story is interesting. A special mention has to go to the dialogue between characters that works incredibly well (especially Dr. Watts amusing lines and moments - SF2 ;) ). Conversations contain remarks that are much more realistic than the predictable dross that you hear in many films.  I like my FPS, action RPG with their fancy graphics, and maybe I am unaware of what is out there, I never got into the JRPG and other such games in their heyday (8/16-bit days) but it is great to see gaming go in these directions. I certainly hope to see more games with an emotional focus. Maybe first person drama rather than shooter.",

            "review_text": "Let's get this out of the way, yes, To The Moon is probably the best Free to Play, physics infused, subscription based MMO style dating sim currently on the market. The lack of spoken dialougue made me harken back to the days of reading books where I read what was being spoken but not actually hearing it (except for audiobooks of course). Now what makes this dating sim so unique, well it just does everything so well, but adds a few things in to freshen it up. Ken Gao is probably the best 40 year old Asian video game writer there is, filling the characters with such classic lines like:  'Ken Gao' '...the...' 'Follow through' 'Name of the Wind' 'Walk' 'Pearl Harbor' 'Dating Sim' 'Frankie Muniz' etc.  The writing is so spectacular, I needed olive oil to calm myself down. Now my Indonesian roomate by the name of Kareem Abdul Jabaar was watching me play this emotionally charged First Person Shooter, when he turned to me and said, 'Are you an angel?'  Confused I turned to him and told him that I was indeed, and we hugged it out for 47 hours. We deficated and urinated together, but it was for the sake of pleasing Kareem, YOU GO GIRL!  The next pro in the never ending list, would be the graphics. Now Ken Gao knows that we haven't had a true story in video games since Tetris, so he intentionally made terrible graphics, in order to give the audience the same wonder when that first Tetris block fell down hard.  The next item, would be the lasting appeal, now it may say that I have eight minutes on this game, but I played in offline mode for a good 2,000 hours because of all of the sweet end game content, that made me both happy and warm. Due to Ken Gao's facsination with antiques and the like, he treated die hard fans, such as myself, to an 40 hour documentary on the breeding habits of chimpanzees living in captivity (with full naration by Steve Irwin himself!). It is incredibly rewatchable. Let's just say Blockbuster better watch out because Ken Gao is gonna suck you dry!  Let me be (Ken Gao) real with you for a second, the music, oh, the music, AHHHHH!!!! As you probably know by now, Elton John and his partner Niel Patrick Harris put in so much effort into this incredibly composed piece of virtual literature. My favorite song in this by far would have to be 'Lick my Love Pump' it is gosh darn good.  Now my favorite part about this story driven game, is the lack of gameplay. I turn it on, click start and I'm off to another world. The lack of interactivity allowed me to participate in other activities, such as:  Playing League of Legends Writing Steam reviews Buying CS GO keys Buying hats Dreaming about Ken Gao Listening to the soundtrack for the movie Freaky Friday starring Lindsay Lohan Listening to the soundtrack for the video game To The Moon Listening to an audio book Contracting an STD etc.  Let's just say leaving this game on and then doing something else while the game completed itself has allowed me to buy newer and cleaner oils for bathing, as well as find my soul mate in life. With this game your productivity will go, dare I sat, To The Moon.  Ken Gao.  Alright, alright reviewer, I get it this game is heavenly, but there has to be faults.  Yes, yes there are faults to To The Moon. Even a perfect game is not without cons so I will list them below:         etc.  So there you have it, Ken Gao has been impregnated, had morning sickness, craved foods, went into labor, and birthed yet another masterpiece that will be beloved by sensitive men and hipsters that happened to stumble upon an IGN review of it. So I can say without a doubt, go and purchase To The Moon, for only 16:9 Widescreen.   (P.S. Lock the frame rate at 1fps for the most cinematic of experiences).  10/10 Would soak Ken Gao in Thousand Island Dressing again.",

The gameplay consists of finding objects or exploring an area and connecting them all together to make a memento, which puts you in a sort of puzzle game, in which you line up parts of a picture to complete it. If the game itself was just what the small amount of gameplay is, it would be boring. There are also some other pockets of different gameplay, which are alright. I love how the graphics look, a 16 bit look with some bloom that makes it seem more like a memory. The story follows two people who work for a corporation that rewrites people's memory on their deathbed, and as they work on a man who wants to go to the moon, and he doesn't know why.

            "review_text": "To the Moon is an original and very creative work that I find a little hard to refer to as a game, due to the relatively few critical interactions available and the complete linearity of the plot. However, unlike A Bird Story, which I thought would have been better as a non-interactive 'movie' using the game engine, To the Moon had enough interactivity to keep it interesting, even if the player was unable to make any choices that really changed the game experience in any way, I guess I think of it as an 'experience' similar to a very easy adventure game.  The story is alternately beautiful, funny, corny, and tongue-in-cheek. The setting is enjoyable, and the main plot device is very imaginative and well thought through. The writing itself is simple, but excellent, and in terms of grammar is much better than most AAA games available today.  The music is delightful, if a bit repetetive (a fact that does not go unnoticed by some of the game's characters). And even though by the end one knows exactly where the story is going, it is still heartwarming -- and also sad -- enough to bring a tear to the eye, while the occasional jokes and unexpectedly offbeat situations were funny enough to elicit a least a few genuine laughs from me, and quite a number of chuckles.  As with A Bird Story, but even more so here, the pixel graphics are brilliant. There's a wide range of settings throughout the story, each with a unique feel, but I did find myself becoming a bit sick of some of the repeated areas, even though they were required for the plot.  To the Moon even has some minigames to break up the flow, which works well. I didn't enjoy them enough to replay more than was required to advance the plot, but they were a great addition to spice things up a bit.  The regular price of To the Moon is a little higher than many other games, for the number of hours of enjoyment you'll get out of it, but even had I paid full price, rather than picking it up on sale, I would not have regretted the purchase. To the Moon is most definitely recommended for anyone who isn't turned off by extremely well-done pixel graphics and a cheesy, but completely enjoyable story.  To top it off I just noticed after I finished To the Moon tonight that there are two free DLCs available for free. What a great bonus to an already fantastic experience!  I was a bit disappointed with A Bird Story, Freebird's short 'game' released sometime after To the Moon, but having played To the Moon now I am very much looking forward to other productions from Freebird.",

Taking a cue from Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (and a bit of We Can Remember It For You Wholesale, P.K. ♥♥♥♥'s short story that became Total Recall), the player takes control of a pair of specialists trained to alter memories of the dying so they can feel like they had no regrets in their final moments.

I am really glad I got to play this game...just wow simple, and short yet a very powerful story.  Man, It was hard holding onto fluid from my optical organs.",

I TRIED, but every time I made a new save, something in me said 'Just a little further. They can't be doing what you think they are..' and then I was proven wrong and my emotions got the better of me again.

Along the way your emotions will be flowing out of you like a   River  . One moment you will be laughing because of the game's clever writing, and the next you'll feel a deep connection with the characters. To the Moon plays off of older style graphics to bring you beyond amazing writing and connection to the characters. The gameplay is somewhat repetitive as it mostly consists of moving your character throughout a space and exploring an area from John's memories, but the writing and subtle music absolutely makes up this. For each time you have to explore an area, the writing makes up for it ten fold. The game itself is only about two to three hours long and is fairly simple to complete. The game also includes free mini story DLC about the two main characters and their life outside of the adventure in the main game.

I expected a game where the player travels back in the old man's memories, and gives him a chance to relive his life - thus allowing the player to play through the man's life and make changes in it. That is not the case at all.  To the Moon IS NOT A GAME! It would be more accurately described as an interactive story. No, not a choose your own ending kind of story. The story is very linear, follows a laid out path and conclusion. The player is not often offered a choice, and even when he is, it doesn't matter. You can only follow one path, and that is that. As such, not only is To the Moon a story rather than a game, it posesses no replay value.  So, is it worth buying? Yes, definitely. Even though the graphics look like it came from the mid-1990s, the story is compelling, and the music beautiful. It's a tear-jerker, and I often felt myself wanting to go through 'just one more scene'.  To the Moon has no keybinding controls, and even though that is a big bugbear of mine, its controls are bound to the number pad, not WASD. As a left-handed person, well done development team.   Also, there is no volume control for the music. Sole control over volume comes from your own speakers or headset.  In short, To the Moon is not a game, has no replay value, no control bindings, and no volume control. But its compelling story and beautiful music more than compensate. Definitely worth the price of admission.",

It's also  so slow  getting through dialogue, if this was simply written as a book I could've read through the conversations about five times as quickly, but the game just makes you wait for each and every painful and not particularly well-written line.

As previously stated it is an interactive novel and it is PURELY an interactive novel and features no gameplay whatsoever. Even though I was fully aware of how this game would play out like that and was perfectly fine with playing an interactive novel (I love the Phoenix Wright games) I couldn't help but feel utterly dissapointed in this game hence the 'not recommended' review. The whole thing just feels like it's in the wrong format, it doesn't feel like it should be a game. The only thing that differentiates this as a game from anything else is the segments where you have to walk around and interact with stuff until the story progresses and you go back to reading again. These segments were an ABSOLUTE CHORE; they were so unbelievably boring the only reason I was doing them was to progress and get to the next point in the game. The game also features cheap puzzles called momento puzzles that offer no fun value whatsoever and are so astoundingly unoriginal. In my personal opinion To the Moon should of been made as an animated short or perhaps even an animated movie, it feels like something that would fit in a Hayao Miyazaki movie. I do not dislike this game I just don't recommend buying it and I usually absolutely despise saying this but perhaps this game is best experienced by a Let's Player on YouTube.

Progression was entirely linear and didn't leave any room for thought. I think my biggest peeve is the dialogue can't be hurried or skipped.

The story is the main selling point of the game, no two ways about it. The game is described as a 'story-driven experience' and tagged as 'story rich', so as you might expect the gameplay takes the back seat. But there's the problem: the game itself is so bad that it serves only as a distraction to the story. Every moment I spent actually playing the game was only so that I could continue the story. I would have prefered only the story, with no game at all. In other words, a movie.  So do I recommend it? Well, maybe.

But if you want a good game, then stay far away from this one. Everything this game has to offer has been done much better.

But in the end, with a ton of games in my stable and decades of gaming, I ended up just dropping it - unable to motivate myself to play any longer. Here's why.  I love adventure games but I don't get why people love old school graphics. I grew up with Kings Quest, Ultima etc. and despite getting nostalgic for those classics, why would I want to play on sucky looking games? So really I found the unatractiveness of the presentation a real bore. Some peole love that stuff and if that's you, get this game and have a cry. I just don't see the point in this day and age. By all means give me a game with the meaning and the feelies, but tell me a great story with at least some decent presentation please!  But it's not just the graphics. It's the gameplay. Again, as an experienced adventure gamer who even used to play text based adventures like Zork and Wishbringer, I didn't mind it in the 80's but it's not like I want to play them again. Fetch quests get dull after a while no matter what. Adventure games need a emotional/psychological pay-off with every completed task to motivate the player. This one, for me, doesn't have enough.   There are a lot of admirable adventure games old and new. They might not all have the poignant subject matter of 'To the Moon' but I prefer something that not only has a good story but decent graphics and good game mecahnics as well. So, I just can't finish this one because I find it tedious. Alternatives: The Longest Journey, Grim Fandango, Syberia, Machinarium.",

            "review_text": "This is not a game in any real sense. While it is “interactive” in the sense that you move around the environment and interact with objects, in truth the interactivity is an illusion; yoru movement in the environment is about as interactive as turning a page in a book most of the time, and at times is actually more tedious because you have to search for where you need to click to get to the “next page” – in the case of this game, the next bit of dialogue or cut scene. The only real “game” elements it contains is a single game of whac-a-mole towards the very end – which you do not need to succeed at to progress in the game, and which actually has no impact on the game at all, as far as I can tell – and some simplistic tile-flip puzzles which are present for the first third or so of the game. These feel wholly out of place in the game and are simply discarded later on. There is no possibility of failure in the game, and the one section that might feel remotely “game-like” is mostly just tediously walking down a hallway for about five minutes – if that. In the end, it is much closer to a movie than anything else – and most likely, should have been exactly that.  The story ultimately has four main characters. Dr. Eva Rosalene and Dr. Neil Watts are the two primary protagonists of the game, and are who the player controls throughout the length of the story. They work for the Sigmund Corporation, a corporation which specializes in rewriting the memories of dying people so that they can experience a different life in which a single wish comes true. The way this is accomplished is by entering the minds of the dying person, viewing their memories, and going back to their childhood and implanting a very strong desire to complete whatever one wish they wanted to see; because they would have a singular, powerful drive their whole life to achieve that goal, their mind will simulate them succeeding at that task (most of the time, anyway; it is implied that it is not foolproof, but that it is pretty reliable) and they will live out their dream in their mind before dying.  The inspiration from  Inception  is obvious, but the game itself has a very different take on things; the goal, in the end, is very different, and the Sigmund Corporation is paid to by the dying people to grant these mental wishes. We immediately see that Dr. Neil Watts is the funny, goofy, eccentric guy, while Eva Rosalene is the competent, no-nonsense character; even still, both have their moments of seriousness and comedy, and Dr. Neil Watts is definitely a Jerk with a Heart of Gold type character, who tries to cover up his soft spots whenever he does not absolutely have to do so.  The dying man in question, Johnny Wyles, is being tended to by his housekeeper, Lily, whose two children run around the house. Early on, I thought that Lily and the children might play some sort of significant role in the story, but in the end they’re only bit parts; the real major players are Johnny Wyles and his deceased wife, River Wyles. As we go back through time via Johnny’s memories, we see events unfold in reverse, and come to understand why things ended so badly for Johnny and River, and why Johnny was unhappy with his lot in life in the end.  The story, on the whole, is reasonable, though there are a few strange plot-holes – for instance, River dies because they cannot afford to pay for both her medical treatment and the new house that they’re building, and River believes that the house is more important than her life, but somehow, Johnny can afford to have a full-time caregiver live in his house, as well as afford presumably expensive end-of-life treatment which allows him to achieve his dream of going to the Moon – something he himself does not even understand, and which the player only learns the true reason for very near the end of the game. The final memory sequence throws a different cast on many of Johnny’s other memories, and it was neat to see how they’d incorporated the hints as to what had really happened earlier in the game.  That being said, I was actually a bit disappointed by the game’s true ending because, unfortunately, I came up with a much better plot twist partway through the story. The first time their attempts at implanting the memories failed, I went back to view Johnny as an old man and the memory was exactly the same. However, there was something which was very interesting which immediately caught my eye – Johnny could not explain why he wanted to go to the Moon, which was seen as unusual by the two doctors, and supposedly made their lives much more difficult.  It was at this point that I realized their brilliant masterstroke – the reason Johnny had no idea why he wanted to go to the Moon was because they (or someone else) had implanted the idea that he wanted to go to the Moon, and thus it felt like an unnatural desire which was simply foisted off onto him that made him feel compelled to wish for it in the end.  I was severely disappointed when it turned out that this was not the case, and the actual cause for it was very different. It wasn’t a terrible reason – even if it was a bit cutesy and a bit clumsy at the same time – but it just didn’t stack up to the plot twist I had built up in my head, and thus I ended up feeling a bit disappointed by the revelations of the true ending of the story.  In the end, the story took a fairly long time to get through, and I got the feeling that it would have made more sense as a movie than it did as a “video game” – moving around in the environment was mostly unnecessary tedium, and the game at times went into cutscenes which showed that it could have simply been a movie the whole way through. It would have gone by a lot more quickly, and likely been several hours shorter as more of a visual novel or movie-like experience, and I think I would have enjoyed it more as such. The pacing was a bit of a problem in places, particularly towards the end when Eva sets everything up for the grand finale off-screen without explaining it to Neil (and thus, the player), creating some unnecessary tension between the two for no good in-character reason. The sequence could have been greatly shortened, made much more visually interesting, and it still would have worked; instead, it felt weird and unnecessarily drawn-out.  There were also a few moments of extreme strangeness. Perhaps the greatest is when the characters at the start of the second act of the story, unable to figure out how to get Johnny to want to go to the Moon, start bursting into Johnny’s memories at random to pitch the idea of going to the Moon to him. While the characters at this point are very sleep deprived, the mood whiplash in this section of the story is severe, as went from some fairly serious memories with humor thrown in to lighten the mood to frenetic comedic action on the part of both of the protagonists. While the humor which was interspersed into the rest of the game actually worked pretty well, the humor in that particular section felt off and too extreme; it is never mentioned again afterwards.  All that aside, the core of the story worked well enough, and while it wasn’t as good of a story as the one I made up in my mind about halfway through the game, I can’t say that I disliked it or felt like the game cheated me, and am interested in seeing if they do something else interesting with the characters in the future – the story ended with the promise that it was “Episode 1 – To the Moon” and, while the story of Johnny and River was tied up in the story, Neil and Eva, our scientist protagonists, have more patients to deal with and more things to do. I’m interested in the idea of seeing what else could be done with them, but I'm not sure I want to spend five hours instead of two watching them do it.",

But the hamfisted plot and the shallow characters that try to pass themselves off as 'deep' get in the way of any sort of emotion the game tries to muster up. A lot of the plot feels like its been cheaply designed in order to wring tears out of everybody - and as a result, the game NEVER turly earns its tears, only being able to cheaply grab them through false emotions and false characters.   And what false charactes they are. For example, there is a character that is defined almost exclusively by her mental affliction. (I am trying to avoid spoilers here for the people who haven't played the game yet, but I will have a section on spoilers at the very bottom of this review for people who have beaten it already.) Anyway, there is pretty much nothing to that character - her personality and actions merely come off as side effects of her affliction. Where's her feelings? Where's her personality? They're not there.   And on top of that we have the grossly manipulative plot - look, here's a song you can cry to that has two notes!!! Aren't you so endeared because it's two notes?!?!? And, Hey, we have this actress character who won't stop being pretentious and preachy about what she has to say!!!!! Isn't she DEEP?!?!?!?!? And hey, here's this character with a sad fate that we bring up with no foreshadowing whatsoever AT THE VERY END OF THE GAME!!!! Doesn't that make you SAD?!? Point is, the game is trying so hard to show itself off as having a 'DEEP STORY' that it, ironically, reveals its own shallowness and the flaws of its own plot.  All the annoying rage aside, the shame of To the Moon is that it could very well have been a good game. The setup itself is very well-done, and could have very well been a breeding ground for all sorts of truly emotional stories. There are a couple of admittedly charming moments (a talk on Doctor Who, in particular, actually did make me smile inside). And the game has very well done 16-bit-esque graphics. However, all of these little 'good' things about the game do barely anything to get away with the bad taste of the story and the game as a whole.  Some people might complain that the gameplay, which pretty much consists of collecting hidden objects to get to the next memory and then solve an fairly easy tile puzzle, is barely even there, and that is also true. I am not opposed to a near-complete lack of gameplay if the game's story is well-done.........but, as I have of course mentioned before, the story feels manipulative and its emotions feel unearned.   In the end, I would say that if you really want to play To the Moon - go right ahead and see for yourself what you think of it. To the Moon is, at the very least, a mildly intriguing experiement on how to tell a story within a game, and it must be experienced for oneself before one can really, truly judge it. And who knows what you'll think? You might even outright love the game. But - try to consider, if you can or if you want to, how desperately the game tries to wring tears out of the player, and don't be entirely shocked if you have a disappointed reaction like I did.  4.0/10        ON SPOILERY STUFF:  I can't talk about all of what annoyed me about this game without getting into some pretty deep spoilers. So, if for any reason you haven't played the game and are reading this right now, then leave immeadiately.       As I mentioned vaugely in the review, I was extremely annoyed by   how River was portrayed as being defined almost entirely by her autism.   As someone who has   a few, diagnosed pinches of Asperger's Syndrome,   it annoys me how   River   felt less like an actual, real person and more like a checklist that ticks off all the   symptoms of autism   one by one. The character of   Isabelle   also felt like an extremely manipulative way to force the player to relate with somebody   with autism,   especially when she did nothing but preach and preach about   autism   in general.  On top of that, some of the game's philosophies on   autism   felt like a huge slap in the face to me. Am I 'concealing' myself in any way if   I don't show myself as autistic, especially if people will judge me as soon as they know that I am?   Am I so detached as to   think of a lighthouse as more of a person than actual people?   Do I   keep completely silent about childhood memories for no reason at all?   These sorts of things in the game's story are not how I behave at all in real life, and not how any kid I've seen   with autism   has behaved either. (There is a 'devil's advocate' argument there in that   every child with autism of any sort is affected by it in different ways,   but I have a very hard time believing that any of them would be   as detached as River is in the game   without some sort of extreme personal tragedy.)  I do realize that in the main review, I do kind of come off as a bit of a heartless a-hole. But this comes from anger at how - there's no other word for it - unrealistic the game's   portrayal of autism   is. I do appreciate that   some of the money that the game has received is going toward charities for autism   - but the fact is, this game is the same type of BS that I've been getting for years in   dumb social thinking classes for autistic kids (I finally got out of these classes a while back, but I had to deal with them until I was a junior in highschool, and even then pretty much all of the autistic friends who are In high school with me are still dealing with them).   I honestly don't think that we, as a society, can truly deal   with autism   until we all realize that the people who are   affected by it are, actually, generally normal people, not creepy and detached freaks   - and I think that this game is a huge step backwards, in that the people who play this will have some skewed understanding of what   autism   is, instead of seeing   how normal the people who are affected by it actually are.    (Also,   sliping in an inexplicable identical twin at the very end   is TERRIBLE storytelling form. In ANY sort of story.)",

Also, what few gameplay elements there are (really simple hunt and find, simple puzzles) barely register. The game ends up being almost purely narrative.   There's definitely some really cool ideas here, but they've been executed better elsewhere.",

            "review_text": "I went into this with decent expectations. I thought it looked like an interesting story from the trailers, and i had heard it had gotten pretty good ratings. But in all honesty, the game ended up just being a disappointment.  First things first, I'm gonna say the two things I liked about this game. The concept and the music.   The concept I enjoyed quite a bit. A company that goes around giving dying people a chance to relive their life or alter their memories in order to give them a more peaceful death. Sounds like an interesting way to tell a story and can lead to lots of philosophical questioning about what it means to be a 'self' and if rewriting the wrongs of your life leads you to a satified death. Could you rewrite your life so that nothing ever goes wrong? What will you have learned? The game never gets that deep though so don't worry about that. I don't hold that against it, that's something I personally find cool, but is most likely very hard to write about and probably can get a little too deep for a lot of people. Still the concept of editing memories is always a novel one to me.  The music definitely has some quality to it. Now I know everybody praises the music for this game, but I have to admit, while it's not bad, it's nothing really special either. When you finish playing the game there aren't any tunes that get stuck to you. Most of the songs are little piano diddies. They're more mood setter's than they are memorable catchy tunes. It ultimately comes off as generic piano music. Good music, but generic. Definitely nowhere near some of the best indie game soundtracks (ex. Bastion, Braid).  Now where does this game go wrong? I have to say its weakest point is the writing. Some points the writing is good. Usually anything dealing with Johnny (the central character whose memories you're walking through) is decently written. It can be sappy and is usually pretty serious, but it pulls off sappy alright. The worst writing, however, is usually between the two scientists (the characters you'll mainly control). There's just nothing believable about their interaction and it put me off quite a bit. Their relationship is an annoying case of silly guy + serious girl. It is very tiring and predictable. Here is a summary of most of their dialogue:  Guy: Makes a groan inducing joke purposely. Girl: Respond with either: '...' or *bitingly sarcastic comment*  These characters are kind of supposed to be the comedic relief, but it never results in comedy, so there is never any relief. This set up is never funny, and it actually makes the writing feel very amateurish. The game also makes self referential jokes a little too frequently for my liking. They must've made fun of the main theme at LEAST 3 times, saying how it's repetetive. If this were the only fault then the story might be ok, but the sappy story is just that, sappy and not strong enough to hold everything together. Everything ends up being quite predictable (some little twists but nothing too crazy). None of the characters really grow or seem to learn anything. It's a love story that you've probably heard before with nothing new to tell you. Honestly, a lot of the writing sort of feels like an anime or something (which is to say, not that great).  The game is made with RPG maker so it doesn't look that great. That's fine right? I mean books don't have pictures most of the time and they can convey emotion and get emotional attachment. Sadly, the writing isn't strong enough to get you attached. I think what might've helped is if there were some hand drawn pictures to show some moments in the game. They do show a picture at one point, but that's it. Though you can tell that the quality of the picture isn't the best, so it's probably for the better that they didn't have much hand drawn art in the game.  Now some people would argue that this hardly a game. I don't wanna go down that route though. I would think that you should be able to tell from the trailers and such that it's not a very 'Gamey' game. That being said, I think there is something to say about linear story telling in this medium. There are ways to do it and ways not to do it. You'd think with the premise of editing memories that the game would have a highly non linear aspect to it. Alas, the game does not take advantage of its concept and really doesn't take advantage of being a game.  That isn't to say that the game is completely devoid of game elements. You still have to walk around and explore and collect 5 or 6 orbs to move on to the next memory. You get orbs by witnessing events and clicking on objects in the memories. Click all the objects you're supposed to click and then you get to solve a little puzzle. The puzzles are simple and not frustrating. They can get a little complex but they never go anywhere too difficult. It's better that way because you really just want to move the story along, not solve puzzles, but this makes the puzzles just kind of seem like a time waster.   This is a story driven game with a fun concept but a weak story. The little amount of interactivity and poor writing makes it feel like you're just turning pages in a book written by an amateur. If you want an interesting love story involving memory manipulation, you're probably better off just watching Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind instead of playing this game.",

I didn't find that to be the case, but I might believe that it would bore the player to tears. I think this might be better rehashed as a simple walk-through interactive story kind of game, because the 'game' components are severely lacking. The basic notion is that you play as one of a pair of scientists brought to a dying man's bedside to install in his mind the memories of having gone to the moon. It is an interesting premise and in a different medium, I would likely have enjoyed it.   The way the game unfolds is that you watch a cut-scene providing a bit of story then are left wandering around to find memory-triggering objects. When you've collected the objects, you bring them to a portal and solve a simple puzzle involving toggling rows and/or columns of an image until the whole image lines up properly. There is no conflict for the player to resolve, nor is there much interplay between the game elements and the puzzle elements (to be clear, the objects collected and images revealed are often references to parts of the story, but the player's presence is one merely of observation rather than interaction).   The graphics are very good, however, in a style similar to and quality comparable to some of the best rpg's and overhead hack'n'slash adventures of the 16 bit era. Dialog is similarly on par with games of that era. I found it generally too corny but it was definitely true-to-style of 16 bit JRPG translations (I find those generally too corny, as well). The music is well-done but overdone. There is solemn piano piece that, while pleasant to listen to a few times, starts to really grate in a depressing way in extended sessions.   Bottom line: There's no game to the game. I appreciate the dev's willingness to take a leap on an experimental concept but it ultimately fell flat for me. I think perhaps the concept would be more suitaed to a passive medium like film or prose, or that the idea should have been worked to incorporate the player into the story in a way that make's the player's role more integral. I got about a third the way through the game and never really felt any connection to the story unfolding or to the characters shown. As a result, I just wasn't enjoying the time I spent playing To the Moon (it felt at least twice as long as the &gt; 2 hours steam reports I played) and as a result, I gave up on it.",

It's about a four hour experience all and all, and the interactive portions are a few simple tile puzzles, and a few this or that decisions in the beginning of the game that amount to no differences later, as far as I could tell. The narrative itself is disturbing, in my opinion-- not sad, or happy-- jut simply disturbing that a simple memory fail could destroy a relationship. Now about that price-point-- worth 10 dollars?

The best part of the game has to be the magnificent soundtrack which will never seize to amaze you due to its simpliness and absolute beauty.  All in all, it's a great 4 hour-journey I'd recommend everyone to have at least once! Very well done, Freebird!",

As most reviews will tell you, the story is what makes this game, and the story is what will make you remeber this game when your done. The story is gripping, emotional, at times hilarious, thought provoking, and very relatable. It's also very well paced. The soundtrack complements it amazingly, with music equatable to Bastion. I'm extremely happy my friend gifted me the soundtrack with the game, cause its worth the listen. If the game has a weakness (and I don't know if I can fully call it a weakness) its that it has very simple gameplay. The gameplay is very much a tool to deliver the story in this game. The graphics may seem like a weakness to some as well, but I'm actually really impressed with what they managed to achieve in a 16 bit graphical style. All in all, this game was amazing, and definitely worth the playthrough. If you ever need proof that a game is a work of art, play this game.   Overall I'd give this game a 9.5 out of 10, or an A.",

It is, no doubt, a story written to bring one to tears and I must say it fulfilled its purpose with elegance and precision. I cried when I was supposed to and I enjoyed every aspect of the third act plot.  The argument mixes good sci-fi ideas, almost in a Charlie Kaufman meets Inception fashion. It is a poignant and beautiful story and it approaches personal tragedy, loss and regret in ways I rarely see games doing. The point is that, even if other games also bring up these themes, not many give the player enough space to let the feelings really sink in their mind, because the majority of games just have the necessity of throwing the character, as soon as possible, into the next combat or feature, exploring the most intricate mechanics. 'To the Moon' has no such thing as elaborate mechanics. Whether this is a positive thing or not depends on the kind of player you are. To me, the lack of complexity in this aspect not only is compesated by the good, touching plot, but it enhances the quality of the storytelling by dictating a more peaceful and reflective pace. The graphics are just pleasant in their simplicity and beautifuly drawn. The colors and the details of the scenarios are great and just help to build up the development of plot and character interaction in ways you don't imagine at first.  The soundtrack is simple but extremely well executed. It pulls at the heartstrings whenever it is needed. It sounds like a cheap trick to make one cry, but if so, as I said before, it achieves its goal with such perfection that I find myself unable to complain. The character construction, although it has received some criticism from the players for lack of depth, it's as good as it should be, in my opinion. All the main characters are relatable and captivating, although flawed. There are good dialogues, full of nerdy references and some punctual jokes that fit perfectly as a counterbalance to the melancholic tone that pervades the game.  This has been a hell of an experience to me. Graphics, soundtrack, plot and characters, all simple but so well delivered. I finished the game in one night through tears and laughs and, in the end, its beauty and sadness stick with me. It is a real testament to the power of story in the game universe.",

But the most incredible thing to me, is even though I know this game so well, 2-3 years later I still cried when I finished just now. As the other reviews say, 'To the Moon' is nothing short of beautiful (in every aspect). Please pick it up and A birds story as well, that just came out today and I can't wait to play it! but show the developers the amount of love that they truely put into this game.",

The bit with the horses is a real pain; trigger the event with the kids before you explore that huge area on foot, and be sure to get really close to the memory when you're finished.

Playthrough can be divided into sittings (gameplay divided into 3 acts), but I recommend doing a single sitting. I've delayed my playthrough for about two months until I thought 'well, it's 2 PM, nothing to do... uhh I might watch a movie... oh wait, I've got to try To The Moon finally!'. Well this game sure took me on an adventure. And it was a great one too! It really does make you think and fall in retrospection...  I cried, a lot, BOOM there you go. The OST is just magical and fits the setting very well. Piano and violins are a heavenly combination. Don't you dare play without sound.  ...argh just get it already!!!!  Interesting playthrough (a mix of rpg and puzzles), heart touching story and ost, simplistic graphics combined with some lightning tricks, resulting in an amazing game - To The Moon.  Pros: + Very good game design. It's not perfect, as I felt lost at some points of the game, but overally the game was keeping track if I'm at the right spot + Good level design. I was personally annoyed by obstacles. There was sometimes just no way of telling if you can go through something or not + 4 hours? Felt like an hour. Wasn't bothered with reading. + A feel trip. Thank you Freebird Games. Cons: - Got softlocked (stuck with no possibility to exit the game or even move) at one point of the game, didn't break my immersion that much, was a little annoying tho, managed to get through that (autosave saves lives). Don't bother with the manual save.",

Overall, I recommend it to any gamer who wants a decent storyline with rather mellow gameplay.  Pros: *Excellent music *Good dialogue *Decent plot *Mildly challenging puzzles  Cons *The game likes to change up the controls every once in a while. *Certain things are just not explained, whether to act as sequel bait or to enhance the mysterious aspect that the game has.

            "review_text": "One of the most amazing and outstanding games I have ever played. It is not so much of the gaming and interaction aspect, but the story and comprehension that makes it so.  The story is about two doctors who traverse back in time through a man, Johnny's, memory to fulfill his wish to go to the moon. They learn of his unstable past of his first love, the horific accident of his childhood, and a meaningless life filled with regret and guilt.   The story brought me to tears. Literally. It was so moving and so complex. The doctors take big risks to make fulfill the dying man's wish. It is so reminiscient of the past, and it makes me wonder what my own life will bring.  The music also amazed me. It's all instrumental, except for one bit at the end, which has lyrics. The music made everything better. And I don't think that just because I'm a classical musician.  Despite minimal physical gameplay, and more dialogue, the story was very moving and a very fun game to play. I normally hate dialogue and reading and clicking, but this time it really didn't matter. The gameplay was also very clever, how you have to find meaningful memories and travel between time peroids in Johnny's life through mementos. Very clever and very simple.   There are a few cons, however. The movement and controls were a little goofy, but it didn't matter. The dialogue between Rosalene and Watts (the two memory doctors) was also very childish. It catered too much to an immature, younger crowd, rather than an adult/teenage crowd. The references made me feel like Niel Watts is a comic relief to the story. While every story needs a comic relief (Shakespeare devloped that very well), I feel like Watts was a little off the deep end. It was childish humour and references and all around useless and meaningless and long dialogue. For once, swearing bothered me. There wasn't too much, but just enough to know that the story doesn't need it.  But all cons aside, it's definitely an amazing game with a touching story that will make you so upset you don't want to play anymore, but it all resolves in a bittersweet ending.   10/10. I am looking forward to recording this for YouTube",

You play as Dr. Watt and Dr. Rosalene two scientists from the Sigmund Corporation sent to help virtually fulfill John, a dying man's, last wish... to get To the Moon.  To accomplish this you use a machine (almost like the animus from Assassin's Creed) to go back through John's memories backwards starting from John's most recent memory all the way back to his early childhood memories.  In each memory you have to find an item that will connect you to one of John's earlier memories. This item has a barrier on it that has to be broken by finding items and talking to people that will give you different colored orbs that will unlock a puzzle which when solved will take you to the next stage. Through the exploration of each level you discover more and more of what John's motivation was for wanting to go To the Moon.   You can beat the game in one sitting if you want to. With a story line this good you might actually do it. The story will make you laugh, make you cry then laugh then cry some more when you see the ending of the game. The sound track is good and for the price it's totally worth it. Don't buy the game looking for a high graphic, high action game. This is a story telling game that takes you back through John's life and moves you emotionally. Get this game and see if you can get To the Moon!!!",

So this is an interesting RPG that is less about actually playing a game and more about interacting with a story. I think this game is the perfect example of a book in game form. While story telling is the primary goal, the player gets invested in the characters because as you play as them, their problems are yours as well.  Also, the story has an interesting twist (not a spoiler); the story is told backwards! From end to beginning! It's intersting and has a surprising emotional impact as you see the pay-offs in the story, and latter what caused them. At first you think, 'Okay, that happened,' and then later you learn the significance of the event. The foreshadow affect is amazing!  Again, this game is all about story. You want to shoot monster, buy something else. This game is for those who love the story put into gaming. I personally believe games like this can have more emotional impact than a book, since the player controls the character instead of just reading about them. I rate this 10/10, 5/5, 1/1, whatever scale you want to use. 100% all the way.  (Played this with my mom, and we both cried together at the end, if that says anything. Oh, and if you can, get the soundtrack too. It's just beautiful, but you might want to cry upon hearing it if you've played the game through.) ",

As these two are the first interactive novels I've played, and from the same developer, I will compare them to some extent.  'To the moon' is an interactive novel. It's more interactive than 'A bird story' (also from Freebird Games), but it is mostly about telling you the story. Even so, the interaction feels more meaningful in 'To the moon'.  The setup is a company that works with fulfilling wishes for people who are at life's end. This is done by going through their memories and help them remember a life where their wish was fulfilled. If you've seen the movie 'Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind' this game has a similar feel to it.  While the story is told you're provoked to consider things like what memories really are and what they mean. To me the story was also very emotional and had me in tears at times. They manage to bring up the issues in a very serious manner interlaced with some light comedy and breaking the fourth wall, without retracting from the overall experience (apart from one scene that I will not spoil, but that did annoy me somewhat).  Is it worth €8? In my personal opinion this story really touched me, and even though I got it on sale, I would happily have shelled out the 8 had I known how good it was. But if you feel unsure, wait for it to go on sale.  For those who like numbers this was an 8/10 in my opinion.",

It's a fair argument to make as the most game-like To the Moon ever gets is some simple puzzles throughout and an out of place chase sequence. Unimportant issues of what defines a game aside To the Moon contains one of the best stories I've experienced from a game in a long time, and one of a very select list of games that broke me down. As you may put together this is a game that you buy for the story more than anything. To the Moon is about a pair of scientists working for the Sigmund Corporation who use a special machine to change the memories of their clients (all of whom are dying people) so that they can die happy. To the Moon focuses on their client named Johnny and his wish to go to the moon, and to say anything else about the story would ruin it. All that needs to be said about the story is that it is beautifully told. Additionally To the Moon has one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard in a game, perfectly complementing any moment throughout. The only complaint to be had is the gameplay, as mentioned before the closest to a game that To the Moon gets are some short puzzles and a sequence that was really odd and honestly felt mood breaking. However, as long as you go in knowing that the point of this game is to convey a story and allow your self to become immersed in it, then the aformentioned problems are minor at best. To the Moon is a beautifully realized story, humourous, heartwarming, and tragic throughout. I do not regret a single cent of the money I spent on it. If you could play a game that has a very well composed story that you more experience than play; than To the Moon is a great game that you will enjoy.",

This is a RPG Maker title, a game creation toolkit of which I have some years of tinkering experience behind me, and far and away this group of talented individuals, Freebird Games, made the most compelling and interesting titles that I have seen come out of that community.  Their prior noteworthy title, Quintessence The Blighted Venom, is a free download from their website if you want more amazing RPG goodness from this same group of folks. It's a bit more traditional RPG than To The Moon, but nonetheless also very much recommended.  Though they really outdid themselves with To The Moon. More of a playable story than much in the way of an RPG, but I was instantly drawn into the world, its characters, and the great storytelling that goes on here. The music is excellent and very fitting and draws out the emotions of each scene.  Being familiar with the RPG Maker XP tools, I can vouch that both To The Moon and Quintessence have a very impressive amount of customized details, work, and game systems implemented. I could go into many specifics, but suffice to say, far above and beyond the standard tools provided in the kit, and a mastery of those that have been provided, are clearly shown in all Freebird Games' titles.  Very impressive work folks. A job well done. A very memorable title. If only more big game companies could remember how to make games like this...  ...needless to say, all Freebird Games titles come very highly recommended by me. ",

It's about all the tragedies and joys that make up our lives. It's about flawed people finding happiness. It's about death. So you'll cry. You'll cry a lot.  But it's also an interactive story, it's 3-4 hours long, and the controls are clumsy. You can either tediously click your way around the screen or use the keyboard (which is easier, except you need to mouse over things to see if they can be interacted with or not.)  It comes with 2 DLC minisodes, but that's approximately 30-40 minutes of extra content and both of them are teasers. Neither of them are very profound. They just hint at big questions that--I assume--are going to be revealed in the sequel.  I got it on sale for $2.49, which is *perfect* for this amount of content. $10 seems a little steep for 3 hours of game + 2 teasers, but you might find it worthwhile if you're looking for a good, tearful story about life.",

Would easily make a great movie. Gorgeous soundtrack that is now part of my background music at work.   But here's the part I want to point out. There are at least 5 different spots in the story that are known to make various people cry, and each spot makes you cry for a different reason. You're the type to cry at weddings? There's a spot for that. You only cry at tragedies? Yup. Chances are good that if you have a soul, at least one of the 5 will get you.  The point is, this game doesn't rely on the same emotional trick over and over to get you. It's an emotional roller coaster, if the track was designed by the inmates of an insane asylum. It pokes and prods you until you're tender and weak, covers your head with a bag of delightful dialog, and then it beats you mercilessly with feelings. And that's before we even get into the two DLC's.  You know what? Just buy the thing and play it. On sale, it's like, less than a coffee. Start it up, screw around with it, and before you know it, you'll be marveling over that beautiful ending.",

Yeah, okay, I see how it's sad, I felt a bit 'awww' by the time I figured it out, but by the big reveal I felt they made it a bit too ham-handed. Kept forgetting how to save/do anything so it got a bit awkward and I gave up at times. The one-puzzle-a-level was interesting, but no restart in case you just get so, so lost. No reward for making it in your 'minimum moves' but I wouldn't even know how, since there's nothing on the side to save towards.  Those 'pros' though. It's an incredibly beautiful game, and I appreciate it for that. I was warned it wasn't gameplay heavy IF I had read any reviews (it was given as a gift) so I can't fault them for that.

I had to play it in fullscreen mode which I don't like because it upscales the relosution and made it looks blurry and it stretched the 4:3 ratio of the game to fit my 16:9 ratio display which makes the graphics in game look disorted.  -Music- The music in this game is amazing, they express the atmosphere very well. One of the reason that I decided to purchase this game is because I really like the piano music at the beginning of the game. I also like the sound effects in the game that plays when the character moves their arms or when they facepalm themselves.  -Gameplay- This game focuses on the story so the main gameplay is exploring places, reading dialogues, and solving light puzzles which I have no problem with if the story is good. If you're not sure what it's like just think like you're 'experiencing' a story in an interactive way.  -Story- The story is the main focus point of this game. It lasts about 3 - 4 hours depending on your playstyle. I think the story of this game is really good because it leaves the player to think after the ending and also because it's so unique and I really like these kinds of story.

The gameplay is fairly simple. Move through memories, find mementos that help you go further back in time, and complete puzzles to properly advance through the stages. It's nothing to write home about, but I found it enjoyable just the same.  The soundtrack is probably the best I've heard in a video game in a long time. The creator of this game did the entire soundtrack himself, and he did absolutely magnificent work. To The Moon could be a sound game, and it'd get by on this alone.  The story. To The Moon could be considered something of a visual novel. But it is the best damn visual novel that I've ever had the absolute pleasure of reading. The story in this is one of beauty. It'll make you laugh, it'll make you cry (a lot). And in the end, I think it may be one of the most fulfilling experiences you ever take.  I wanted to nominate To The Moon for a number of catagories. However you can only nominate a game for one. As such, I've nominated this game for the 'there's something in my eye' award. To The Moon is a beautiful experience, and I defy you not to cry at least once through its' many stages. This game is a thing of beauty, and on sale for far too cheap right now. If you can, buy it.

            "review_text": "To the Moon....certainly took me to the stars! 4.5 of them anyway. So let's get down to reviewing.  To the Moon is a story driven 2d RPG/Puzzel game. What I mean by this is that the game includes momentos (hah...see what I did there.) to the common mechanics in the genre's but really is nothing more then an Role Playing game. The role which you play is of two Sigmund Corp. scientists, Dr.Neil Watts and Dr Eva Rosalene, who are sent to asssist a man named Johnny who is on his death bed. Their job is simple, use a large machine in order to edit his memories to allow him to die with his final wish, to go to the moon. Over the course of perusing around his memories to collect momentos the dynamic duo learn Johnny's entire tragic life as well as about River his late wife whom place a major role in making you cry. The story of the game is exceptional, one of the best and most memorable experiences in indie games. It will make you cry, laugh, cry and laugh, feel unsure of how much you should be laughing or crying, etc. It's a tear jerker and a memorable experiece for sure. And there's something that will forever be rewarding in the final sunset of the game. The characters are well developed and beautifully dynamic (Neil is also my spirit animal). River and Johnny's interactions will make you smile like a child and cry like your wife died. So if you love a good story, head To the Moon. However you have to be into this game for the story because when it comes to game mechanics and game play there is very little. To the Moon is meant to be detail based in it's gameplay. It asks the player to searh it's 2d environments for objects and conversations of significance to Johnny to progress. After the environment his been explored you have to take the memory links you've gained and used them to unlock the momento. The momento can then be used to travel through to anouther memory by solving a puzzel. And these puzzels are easy. it doesn't matter how many moves you solve it in you will still progress. Other then these 'fetch quests' and puzzels, there is one hallway fight involving throwing trees and it's a fun change of gameplay however breif. So in short, the gameplay is a fine change of pace and the fetch quests let you absorb alot of the envirnment and story you would otherwise miss, but honestly there just isn't alot of game. The graphics are also heavily stylized. Kan Gao made this game in RPG maker, so I understand that the engine has it's limitations and the game doesn't look bad. Areas are well modeled for the most part and diverse. And while I personally didn't care for the NASA HQ, it certainly doesn't mean that the designer did a poor job. Ontop of that, the diversity of the characters looks to the NPCS is very refreshing, as there is always clarity on who to talk to. Not to mention each of the chosen Momentos are symbols, and these symbols are designed with great litterary purpose. The only thing that I would say detracts from the game's look are the cut scenes which look like they were made in GIMP. But even then, these computer drawn images have alot of charm to them, so as much as they are bad, they are good. The OST is breif yet beautiful and mostly is composed of piano. And while I wouldn't say to go out and buy it, as the OST is very related to the game itself, I would say it's meshed perfectly into the story. Each song builds up emotion perfectly and never feels out of place in a scene. Honestly, after you finish the game then by the OST as the soundtrack will remind you of every heatfelt moment.   So to sumarize: - PROS - Memorable, emnotional narrative - Heartfelt and memorable OST - Beautiful character design - Extreme Detail and interactability - 'Charming' graphical design - Forces you to explore the environments your in. - Emotional replay value  - CONS - OST tracks are brief and repetitive if not for what they are related to. - One area modled strangly - Cut Scenes look cheap.  So what if you're a completionist? Well fear not, this game will be the easiest you've ever completed. While it has no completion bonus beyond closure to a beautiful story, you only have to do one thing to complete it. Get Johnny to the moon! Just sit back, and enjoy this five hour story and as long as you don't keal over from heartache or smiling so hard your face gets stuck, you'll have completed the game. As for the DLC minisodes, they just add 40 minutes of story and a cool new gameplay mechanic and are completely worth playing. They expand the universe nicely without making the game any harder to complete. So in short, just finish the game and congrats, your a completionist, no struggle at all.   So finally my rating for this game is 9/10 , Complete it!",

However, to implant the memories, the doctors must first plant that desire on him as a child as the will was not very strong to begin with. John says at he doesn't know why, he just wants to go to the moon. As you travel backwards through John's memories you learn more about him and what he has gone through. The characters feel alive in a sense that you care for all of them you talk to. Each new character that is added as the story progresses feels natural. Not all is dull either, Neil, the male doctor is always providing comic relief throughout the game ('HADUKEN!').  Visually the game is well done. At first I thought I would be put off by the style but it really grew on me. There are a few cartoon drawn moments that I felt were out of place. Thankfully that only happened two or three times.  Gameplay is where the game is at its weakest. Between each set of dialog in the memory you are suppose to find five important items that give you orbs to use on a memento. This memento allows you to proceed to the next memory. Items are hidden and sometimes leave you moving the mouse cursor left to right waiting for the cursor to change into a hand to pick up the item. Other times orbs are randomly given by just walking around exploring. This can be highly annoying if you have four out of the five orbs and can't find the last one. Thankfully that only happened twice for me.  After you beat the game, within the game's folder in steam there is a free DLC that adds 20mins onto the ending. It doesn't add anything to important to the story but if you enjoyed the main game, you should check that out as well.",

The game's little details in design more than make up for the occasional hiccup (like getting stuck in a wall). On another level though, I personally think that the game could have taken itself more seriously at times, because it simply deals with very serious topics.   You may find that playing To the Moon is the first time you even encounter those topics in a video game. It's always nice to see the medium grow and tackle new subjects. As far as narrative structure is concerned, you will probably not be disappointed by To the Moon's innovative approach. It feels like a bunch of literary devices were taken from different movies/books and fused into one, but this combination does not feel dated at all.  The way the game's themes are integrated into the story world is very confusing at times, which is actually important for the narrative itself. Sounds too abstract? I'd spoil it for you if I said any more.  On the whole I consider To the Moon an exceptionally interesting and moving game/narrative, which is supported by a nice(ly used) soundtrack. If you are interested in video games as 'vessels' that contain stories, then I definitely recommend playing this. And yes, you will cry.",

It is very important to get this out of the way first in order to not attract people who want to see running and shooting in their video games to this one.  But if you're not one of these people and would enjoy just sitting down and watching a beautiful story unfold in front of you (with very minimal imput from you side, as it is 100% linear) - then To The Moon is definitely worth your time and money. It has everything you could ask for in a game like that: extremely engaging but also thought-provoking story, very livelike and likeable characters, beautiful presentation and a great soundtrack. It may be somewhat short, but I couldn't get myself away from it until if was over (took 4-5 hours roughly), and would definitely recommend it to anyone not looking for an actual RPG here.",

There's also plenty of comic relief and jokes sprinkled in for players who have lived through the 90s, delivered via Dr. Neil. The effect of viewing John's life in reverse has a great effect similar to that of the film 'Memento' (2000) in that the motivations and reasons behind his actions (as well as others) are revealed in a sort of twist.  While created in the visual style of traditional JRPGs from the 90s, 'To the Moon' is definitely no Final Fantasy (and I mean that in a good way). First of all, the game is very much story driven--most gameplay involves exploring the areas for small cutscenes and searching items/people for 'data bars' to unlock the next part of the story. There is a puzzle component in 'preparing' each memento before accessing the next memory, but there are no move constraints or special conditions to complete the easy puzzles. For a player who plays primarily for story, this may be a plus since you then spend significantly less time distracted from the main story. 'To the Moon' definitely plays quickly--I finished it in a matter of hours--but is extremely worthwhile.  The music of this game is also as beautiful (if not more so) as the wonderfully nostalgic quality of the graphics. One could easily listen to the soundtrack as a standalone and it is a perfect accompaniment to the touching storyline.  In short: great emotional story, beautiful music, must play for those who love playing games for their stories.",

            "review_text": "I almost didn’t play this game. I almost passed up the Humble Indie Bundle which included this game. That would have been a huge mistake. What first caught my eye about To The Moon was it’s pixel art. I decided to give it a try and now it’s one of my favorite indie games. A moving story, great music, and fantastic characters make this a must-play for anyone who likes story-heavy games.  Story To The Moon follows Dr. Eva Rosalene and Dr. Neil Watts who work for a company that changes people’s lives. They are hired by those about to die, and have the power to change the dying person’s memory to fulfill any last wish they may have. Their current patient is an old man named John who wishes to go to the moon. It’s up to Rosalene and Watts to make their way through John’s memories to change them in such a way that allow John to visit the moon, at least in his memory. It sounds rather complicated, but the game eases you through it. Also, the game progresses reverse-chronologically through John’s memories, and some of the more sombre subjects are dealt with early on, so their impact isn’t as depressing to the player. And there are a lot of adult themes in this game. I don’t mean sex or drugs, I mean real adult themes like death, marriage, mental illness, family, etc. The story is very moving and has a touch of Miyazaki about it, and I’ll admit I cried more than once during my playthrough. Thankfully, the game does a good job of breaking up the heavier sections with more lighthearted ones. Rosalene and Watts are hilarious, and I found myself cracking up on multiple occasions. There were some pop culture references that felt a bit shoehorned into the game, but aside from that, the story was spot-on. It’s hard to go into a lot of depth about this game’s story without ruining what makes the story so great to begin with. Just play it for yourself. You’ll understand.  Gameplay TtM is marketed as something of an adventure game, but it feels a little more like a visual novel. As such, it’s light on gameplay and heavy on dialogue. Not that this is a bad thing. I personally love these kinds of games, however if you’re expecting explosions or killstreaks or powerups, or are an IGN writer, you’ll have to look elsewhere. The game involves top-down 2D movement through environments. You can either move by using the arrow keys/numpad, with the spacebar to interract, or use the mouse to click on your destination. I wasn’t fond of the mouse controls, however moving the cursor over items allowed you to see what you could interact with, which was nice. The pathfinding with the mouse controls also didn’t always work well, so arrow key control was the most effective method for me. Throughout the memory sections, your goal is to find important items in the environment that allow you to unlock the next memory. At the end of each memory, you’ll also have to complete a tile-flipping puzzle to move on. None of these things are particularly difficult, however it’s enough to keep you feeling involved.  Presentation The graphics in this game are all pixel-based. I really enjoyed the characters and some of the environments, however the outdoors environments are a bit cluttered and it’s sometimes hard to tell which tiles are navigable and which are obstacles. However, I really enjoyed some of the subtleties with the character animations. It’s amazing how changing 2 pixels can carry a huge meaning. The music for this game is absolutely beautiful. Most of the tracks are emotionally moving piano pieces, however strings and music boxes are also used in the soundtrack, and every song has meaning and emotion to it. This game would be nothing without its soundtrack. One minor thing I noticed while reading through the dialogue in the game is that there are a few spelling errors and places where the grammar seems a bit awkward, suggesting that this game was probably translated from another language, however it detracts little from the flow of the game and is perfectly excusable.  TL;DR To The Moon is a beautiful visual novel game with a stunning soundtrack. The game will make you cry from how moving it is, however it knows how to interject humor to lighten the mood. The developer has also decided to make this game into a series, and I’m beyond excited to play the next installments. This is a game that everyone needs to experience.  Pros: - Moving story - Beautiful soundtrack - Great characters  Cons: - Some shoehorned pop culture references - Some confusing environments - Some minor spelling/grammar errors Final Score: 9/10",

There's very little actual gameplay, and it's not a very long game (3-4 hours, tops) but that doesn't take away from the game in the slightest. It's the best 3-4 hours and &lt;$10 you'll spend on a video game in a very, very long time. Buy this now, keep a box of tissues on hand, and thank Kan Gao when you're finished for making such a masterful work of art.",

I will tell you that the emotional roller coaster everyone is letting on to is the second half of the game, with the first (probably the 'boring' part people were talking about) is exposition, wonder, and getting information. Like solving a mystery. It's all delving deeper into who this man is, who his wife was, and setting up the question 'How did it end up like this?!' and 'What was this supposed to mean?!'. The first half of the game makes you ask questions. Questions you want answers to and questions that drive you further into the game. And when you get to the second half, the roller coaster begins. And let me tell you. Anger, Fear, Sadness, Happiness, Horror - I felt all of those feelings to a degree in the second half of the game. And it was amazing.",

And having now beat the game in a little over 3 and a half hours (having only looked up if I needed to get off the horse to exit the stage; we'll get to that in a bit), that's exactly what I got.  To the Moon did make me start to tear up at one point, as the game progresses from a man's old age to his youth, and you see what happened to bring him to where he was.   The art is good, the music is fantastic, but the controls leave a bit to be desired. I ended up playing the game with part mouse and part keyboard for movement, and quite frankly I still don't know which was better. Perhaps using a controller would have helped (if I even could; I didn't look). As mentioned above, the movement controls, and sometimes even the mouse selection, can be iffy.  While I understand it's built on top of an RPG Maker version, there's no real RPG elements, just point and click and minor puzzles.  But despite the minor issues, the game is recommended. 4 of 5 stars.",

You play two doctors that grant dying people their last wish by altering their memories (though in real life, nothing actually changes). Memories are altered by stepping backwards through the patient's memory. In this fashion, you see the patient's life events backwards. Once you can find the right motivation to trigger the patient's wish, you've completed your job. In this game, the doctors try to grant a dying man his wish to go To the Moon.",

You take on the role of two company doctors as they travel back in time through an old man's memories. Their goal is to gather enough info to fulfill the old man's wish of going to the moon.  It's actually a well written story that's part drama part romance and part adventure. There is an excellent soundtrack that helps to convey the mood.   The art is unfortunately pixelated (this was made with RPG Maker) but this is forgivable since 'To the Moon' is all about reading a good storyline. But this is an interactive storyline, which I think is a better medium than a regular paperback book. A paperback book is passive entertainment, but a visual novel like this keeps the reader engaged through constant interaction.  In addition to navigating through the story there are also some minigames that are short, easy, and entertaining. There is no way to lose or die in this game, and since it's fairly linear you won't get lost either.  If you like a good story you should check out 'To the Moon.'  ",

The story of this game might be good, but the music adds Soooo much.  Speaking of the story: you'll laugh, you'll ponder, you'll feel all the feels you didn't think you could feel. Hmmm, have you ever watched an anime from 'Key'? Like 'Kanon', 'Air', or 'Clannad'? Very similar vibe. This game has so many wonderful red herrings to throw you off the track, but then brings you back with a new piece of information.  Ugh, explaining doesn't really do it justice. Look, do you like nice stories with complex layers and GORGEOUS piano driven soundtracks? Then buy it already. It doesn't even take that long to get through, about as long as 'Gone Home'.

It's very much focused on the narrative which means there isn't much in terms of gameplay, but this doesn't make it bad. The story, characters and setting are all so beautiful that it's a pleasure to accompany the characters as they discover new things.  The game focuses on an dieing old man called John, who has requested the services of a company who can alter memories of the dieing so their final moments are pleasing. You play as two scientists from the company (with great character dynamics) as they traverse his memories in order to learn more about him and to change his memories in the right way so that he goes to the moon. I won't spoil much more, but you get to see John's journey through life meeting some great characters and gradually learning more and more about him.   The music is also fantastic, accompanying the beautiful, funny and scary parts of the game perfectly.  Apart from a few puzzles (which never become very difficult) and minigame, most of the game consists of searching from objects that will allow you to traverse John's memories. That might sound tedious, but you often learn things as you explore, so I never really felt annoyed when having to search the level. If you prefer gameplay over a narrative, then you might want to give this game a skip, but I would prefer it if you gave it a chance. There's a lot of dialogue, but it's so well written and engaging that you won't minding sitting and reading.  The graphics are done in the 2D RPG style and they are very well suited for this sort of game. The fact that you grow attached to what are quite blurry 2D characters means the game has done a good job. Graphics won't blow you away, but they are still good and serve the purpose.  BUY IT NOW!",

            "review_text": "This is less a video game, and more of a video story. Despite its pixel art appearnance there's very little about To The Moon that qualifies it as a 'game'. There are some puzzle solving elements, a 'key finding' mechanic that amounts to clicking all over the screen LA-Noire style, and there are some very minor mini-games scattered throughout. I would opine that some of these detract from the experience, and I think most players will find them superfluous at best. Therefore, the reason I recommend To The Moon is not on its strength as a game, but on the strength of its story.  It's a story about loss, about love, and about sacrifice. I can't say that you will feel the same way I did, but I was emotionally affected by To The Moon. I don't think 20-year old me would've appreciated it as much as mid-thirties me does, and I've found myself thinking about the story even after I've finished playing; wrapping up stray plot threads in my mind, and refelcting on how the characters interacted with one another. The soundtrack is also very good as well, tonally setting the scene in many places.   The game does have its weak points. The writing is uneven, with some moments feeling oddly placed, and some falling flat (there is an action beat involving a life-threatening event that seems unnecessary). The interplay between the two doctors is cute at times, even funny at others, but at certain points it gets tiring, Mouse detection can be wonky, which is frustrating at times. The ending is a little saccarrine, and I wonder if the story couldn't have been wrapped up differently without the neat little bow that gets placed on it, but these are just minor quibbles - any game that can make me feel emotions like To the Moon must be doing something right.   I got it during the Summer Sale for $1, and it was worth every penny. I'm hoping the sequel is produced with the same care, quality, and originality as this one.",

Then I realized I never formally wrote a review.  Few things affected me as much as this game, though there are some. There is a certain realm of innocence and simplicity to be tasted and enjoyed in reality. Not enjoyment brought about by shallow desires, the rewards of complicated obligations, and so on. Rather, it is the type of simple joy brought about by life's simple yet greatest gifts: love, care, understanding, compassion, and bonding during difficult times. Though surrounded by complex, scientific methods of changing a person's earliest memories, at its core the story of To the Moon is no more than that: simple, pure, and good. It's a story about a man and his peculiar wife, whom he loves and understands and with whom he endures a great deal. To the Moon is a game about the fullfilment of this man's genuine wish due to his sense of love, loyalty, and unity he feels towards his wife. It's a story that will make you laugh, cry, and ponder life, as it certainly made me do. This game explores life's simple treasures and truly emphasizes what is important in life.

To the Moon is an exercise in not judging a book by its cover. I'm still thinking about it and debating the story of this game with my friends many months later.

            "review_text": "This game is COMPLETELY worth the 3 hours it took me to finish it. It's more of an interactive story with a fixed ending, but no matter what it's gorgeous. First off, the pixel art is intricate and varies enough between areas that buildings don't look like slightly modified copies of each other. Each character sprite is unique, and even age is portrayed well beyond the color of his hair. In the events where line art is used, it doesn't always fit (the most blatant example would be with the rocketd.) It turns away from the aesthetic.  The story is probably the best part of the game. The premise is this: two scientists use technology to enter a dying man's mind and grant him one final wish before he passes. It's simple enough, but clearly proves otherwise. As they go through his memories things become more complicated due to two characters and their effects on his life. The only real hindrance to progression of the story are the puzzles, which are by no means difficult. The only problem I personally had with the story is that for replayability I wish there could be multiple endings that can be achieved. Unfortunately that's not the case. The soundtrack is also very good. There is a key theme (For River/To the Moon) that appears frequently and is the biggest identifier of the game overall. Multiple characters are depicted playing it at different points in both reality and the future generated by the scientists.  Emotions were definitely played with over the course of this. I cried at least three times, but probably laughed even more. Neil, one of the scientists, and even Eva on occasion were great sources of amusement beyond the entertainment of the story. They're more than just edgy people doing a job.    Presentation is also done well. All of the characters are unique. My belief is that River and Isabelle both had Aspberger's as that's what I drew from the story (I drew the conclusion on Isabelle after the point where the admits to having the same diagnosis as River.) The fixation on folding rabbits is her indirect way of trying to remind Johnny of when they first met, not in the cafeteria but on the log at the carnival. Isabelle and River both present Aspberger's in two completely different ways that are both accurate within reason. Not to mention, they don't refer to others as normal. Isabelle can be quoted as referring to Johnny as 'neurotypical' and satisfies that need to present autism as a whole as not an illness, but a trait. Clearly the writers did their research to write characters from an informed perspective and as a consumer I greatly appreciate this.     The story's twists definitely kept it from being predictable even though we knew from the beginning how it would end. I may even play again, though probably for much less enjoyment than I had the first time.  Honestly, my only other complaint was the controls. Movement was point and click or arrow keys, though considering the mouse is needed for other functions I would have appreciated WASD movement over arrows. The only point when WASD is used is during a sequence where plants need to be shot in different directions. The right click to access the pause/options wasn't necessary, but as the developers didn't exclude escape as an option it's more redundant than obnoxious.  Overall I'd give this game a 9/10. The only things that could make it better would be multiple endings, more scenarios/clients, and different controls. Otherwise the game is beautiful as-is. I likely won't be playing it again for awhile, but luckily for me I have A Bird Story in my library already. If you're looking for a story-heavy game with pixel graphics and an amazing soundtrack, look no further. I can't recommend it much more than this. If someone has something better let me know. I'll throw money at them in a heartbeat.",

The dialogue is believeable, the pace is slow but intreaguing, makes you wanna guess a lot about whats goin on as the story is told in a series of backwards jumps in time through memories. I cannot stress enough that this story is impressively amazing. Beyond all expectation. Any attempts to be funny in this game WERE funny and not dreadfully cheesy, and the tear jerking moments were enough to break anyones heart. Not to mention the soundtrack is BEAUTIFUL.   My only hesitation with this game is that the controls are bad enough to make you go absolutely mad. Invisible walls EVERYWHERE and youre characters move dreadfully slow for an exploration type game, but this SHOULD NOT deter you from buying and loving this game.  Overall, ive never felt so intregued by the elements of a storyline in a video game with it just being a mere point-and-click. Most games rely on customization, combat, tactics, maybe even online capability to grip you into the story, but this one does it with mere creative scriptwriting.

If you want to read another review saying 'To The Feelz' then feel free to move ahead.  That being said, before I explain which are my points of disappointment, I want to say that this is indeed an amazing game. It is short, standing at 5 hours of gameplay for most cases, so if you're looking for a lenghty visual novel, that's not the case here. However, it is a very good short story worth playing. It is mostly story though, beyond some minor puzzles and exploration. Also, it has a profound soundtrack. Overall, I would give this game 4 out of 5 stars.  Why not 5 stars? Keep reading, but I suggest you finish the game first.  *SPOILER ALERT*  Since you're exploring Johnny's memories, the story is told from his point of view. We see him dealing with River's illness and staying by her side until the end. We even see him granting her last wish, by allowing her to die to save their dream home. You know that this is going to be a sad story, since this is the story of a couple of scientists granting an old man's dying wish. However, I can't understand how the characters almost completely overlook the saddest point of all, which was River's ordeal.  Let me explain... while you play the game moving from the present to the past, you see that as part of River's illness she develops an obsession with creating rabbit origami. Every time she creates one of these she asks Johnny to describe what it is, but Johnny is unable to provide a satisfactory answer for her. At some point on the story, it is revealed that she started this obsession after Johnny told her something about their first meeting. You don't know for certain what he told her, but you know that his friend Nick knows about it. Since Johnny met Nick in middle school, you know that the event is something that happened at that time.  Now, when you learn the actual mystery of the game, you get to know that Johnny doesn't remember most of his childhood after the trauma of losing his brother and taking some medicine to forget about it. But here's the true tragedy: Johnny also forgot his actual first meeting with River when they were kids. It was the time when their connection started, the one that would last for all their lives. They were stargazing, they saw a bunny on the stars with the moon as its belly and Johnny ended up giving away the platypus stuffed toy as a present to River. It is the same platypus that she would keep for all her life. She also tells him about her love for lighthouses and how she would like to befriend one, one day.  So now, let's look at the story from River's point of view. She met Johnny when she was a little girl and they had a strong connection. He promises to meet her at the same spot next year, but that doesn't happens. She remembers about him, because she keeps her gifts. Later, by chance, she actually meets him again and they go out and eventually get married. And after they live almost a lifetime together, Johnny confesses something that makes her aware that he doesn't remember their first meeting and what may be the most crucial point of their relationship. But, River having a mental illness and being introverted, she doesn't just tells him: 'What the hell, Johnny?! Don't you remember that time when we were kids?' No… instead she tries to show him. She makes paper bunnies and asks him to 'see', to make him remember the moon. The last bunny even has different colors, because the moon is its belly. As final challenge, she asks him to throw away a bag Johnny has given her when they first met, and he does because for him it doesn't means anything. So in the end, she dies knowing that the man she married is not the same boy she met on the cliff that night when they were friends.  That's the true sad story here. River's story. And what I cannot understand is how the main characters of our story, the scientists, are completely ignorant about it. They saw it, they must understand what was happening, but they don't even make a reference about River's point of view. I know she's already dead, but not recognizing how hard it must have been for her it's the same as ignoring it. For me, it's like saying: 'Yes, too bad for her, but this is Johnny's story, not hers'.  In the end, I agree with Dr. Watts, Johnny didn't actually wanted to go To The Moon, what he wanted was to remember why he felt that the moon was special. He wanted to remember the moment that he actually met River. I think that would have been fairer to both sides of the story: Johnny's and River's.",

            "review_text": "For those that haven't played this yet, I'll be as spolier free as possible.  ---  To the Moon has a beautiful story and a wonderful soundtrack, just don't buy it if you're one to skip dialogue/cutscenes to simply get into gameplay, because the story is all there really is in this game and is the only real motivation to play it. What you do is explore the setting around you by clicking the left mouse button to move your character, and click on things in the environment to get more story, whether that be to talk to a character, or to read something. A lot of the time, doing that, you'll collect colored energy orbs; eventually you'll collect enough orbs (five at most) to then go to a significant object, and shoot the orbs at it to get into the next section of the story and new setting, to do it again. Before you do though, you must unlock the object by breaking its shield with the orbs, then you'll have to do a very easy puzzle where you flip over parts of an image to make the picture whole. There are a few moments that are unique to the rest of it (most that work well, and one that is just okay), like a small part early on that plays on your expectations of the game due to its overhead 16-bit visuals.  In general though, the game is well worth the money it's priced at as its story will make you smile, laugh, and perhaps for some, even cry, though if not, at least feel heavily for what is going on. The story is accompanied, and I would say even enhanced by what is pretty much the only sound in the game, which is its soundtrack. Since there is no voice work, it helps that the dialogue is extremely well written, and what doesn't seem to be, is intentionally so to help you further understand the characters personalities. The 16-bit visuals do justice to the character models as well, as they're expressive just enough for you to understand and feel for these characters. As to not spoil much (since you'll want to experience it yourself), you control two characters through the journey of memories: Sigmund Corps' Dr. Watts and Dr. Rosalene; their job is to use a machine to get inside ones mind to create artificial memories for their patients, patients that are in their last few remaining days of life and want to go in peace.  Their patient is Johnny, an elderly man that you soon figure out has one last wish: to go to the moon, so Rosalene and Watts have to figure out how to get him there. It's not literal, as it's through his memories. When you start, you go from his eldest age, and at first gradually, to his younger self. That is what the story is about, learning about Johnny's life through the years, happy and sad. Since you're basically going backwards in time, this lends the story to have mystery, and it makes you ask questions, giving you motivation to want to push forward for those answers. There's a lot of sweet, charming moments in his story, but it's mostly filled with moments of hard times. It's largely up to the two Drs. that give the back and forth moments of laughter, as they don't seem to get along with one another. Watt's being the arrogant, seeming to not care as much character, and Rosalene being what seems to be the less clumsy, well mannered one. They may speak and be the playable characters to see this story through, but it's really about Johnny's story; they're just on the journey with you.  There are several other characters in it that are important as well which I'll leave you to discover on your own. There are also references to culture: from books, internet sites, TV shows, and other video games. The game takes four hours to complete give or take (it took me four and a half almost exactly). You may think that that's too short, but it's actually just right. I fully recommend this to anyone that just wants a great story in a game, but if you're someone that wants fantastic gameplay, this may not be for you. If you are however the one to take interest in it, then once you're finished, it's a game that'll stick with you. While it lacks replay value after the credits role, you'll be wishing to see a friend or family member play it just to see their reaction and to discuss it.",

I'd recommend it at any price below €5, nothing more. There is only one achievement (beating it) and there are no alternate endings or worthwhile choice branches. Replayability is practically zero.  8/10, some story kinks and gameplay issues aside, it's a top class story.

There's really not much else to say about gameplay. You walk around, trigger cutscenes or puzzles, wash, rinse, repeat.  Where To the Moon really shines, though, is in the story it tells. And oh my God, is the story good. The game focuses on storytelling, to the point where it's almost self-aware. It's such a bittersweet tale that the player experiences. I honestly broke down and cried during some parts because it's told so well and you really form an emotional attachment to the characters. The music is pleasant, as well.

The themes are pretty heavy, there are some seriously depressing moments but there also is enough humor to somewhat balance it out so it doesn't feel dark.  As an aspiring game developer myself, I'm very inspired by what works about the game but somewhat meh about the things that don't work well for me. I'm not a fan of having to force my monitor to go into low resolution mode to play full screen. I'd have much prefered to play the game with my Xbox controller than with the keyboard and mouse; it uses the arrow keys for navigation instead of WASD so I can only assume that the developer is left-handed, but there's no way to remap the controls.   The graphics are acceptable, but for my retro asthetic I prefer the pixel art of Stardew Valley. The outdoor map design felt a bit haphazard and unnatural. The higher resolution cartoon cutscenes worked well.  Overall, I'm pretty happy with the game and give it a 9/10. I love sci-fi and psychology and really enjoy the various themes and tropes of this game. Great music more than makes up for the mixed-quality visual asthetic.

Quite quickly, though, the story grabs you, and although you still think the graphics are bad, that slowly becomes less important. And then the story really kicks in; at some points intriguing, at others sinister, it turns into a deeply emotional tale of a dying man's life, and where it all went so wrong. Back in time we go looking for answers.  The final revelations are just so mind blowing. I didn't actually cry, but, for me, it was such a deep emotional experience that changed me, and left a lasting impression - one which I still remember over a year later. It's the type of experience you really want to share with someone (probably because you want to talk about it).

Kan Gao and freebird Games, thank you for your game design and story. I played it exactly on 25 Dec 2016 for the whole Christmas day, and read the English dialogue carefully word by word, and make notes on them, including the whole words between John and River when they met and chatted under the moon. Because of the careful reading and making notes, it actually took me more than 13 hours to go over the whole game, until 6 am on 26 Dec.  I am totally moved by this game, even though I heard of this game for years and knew it is affecting (That is why it is my first steam game). But still, when I really went through the game, I felt I recalled a number of forgotten things in my own life, just like John's oblivion.   This plot is about love, amnesia, autism, and telling to each other. The theme of love includes many dimensions: the obscure love between John and River when they was a kid, the love between them after the marriage but John has forgotten the past, the eternal love between them engraved by the lighthouse and even built real graves under it, the metaphor of lighthouse about communication and love, the expression of love and reminder by River of origami rabbits....   I suppose, besides love, the meaning of life and the importance of forgotten things are the most important elements.I just started the game without any background knowledge of the game, expect for the game's goodness. As the plot went on, it was just like a touching movie to me. There are no fight, no level and no 'death' in this game, instead, it has humorous dialogue between two doctors, impressive life development of John, and more importantly, the consideration of meaning of life. The game is also a detective plot, letting player to find out the final answer 'why he want to go to the moon' by flash-back of John's whole life. As I describe, when I read the dialogues in reversed scenes, it recalled me my own life experience, just like what we did in the exploration of John's life. By doing so, some forgotten pieces of my life have also been collected, smooth and peaceful.   In addition, the BGM is so impressive, a number of praises are already for it. So I did not comment on more here.  Thank you for your game again, I am going to play the spin-off small games, and the 'a bird story'. But especially, I am looking forward to your new game, which is another case of two doctors, 'finding paradise'.  ",
