            "review_text": "If you like bullet hell games, you will be satisfied. The game itself is easy to learn, you does only need 4 button to play. 2 for your weapons and the other 2 for your ultimate attack and dashing. For moving it depends your way playing the game, either with your keyboard or a controller. Dashing is very important in this game, because you cannot achieve anything in this game without that kind of skill...except weapons, those are unlocked after 10, 20, 30 times and so on :P It's not for the faint-hearted. You will need at last a good dozen times to clear the first level ON EASY. The game has 3 levels of difficulty: easy, normal and hard. Doesn't cleared one level on hard so far.  You must learn the patterns of your enemys attack and appearing on the display, and yeah that is really fun, especially if your friend are watching :D There are many weapons to achieve, like bazookas, guns, a sword, mines, a flame thrower and so on. There are 7 levels in this game to clear. I'm after hours of playing only at level 4. At last I have to tell you a word or two about the music! Epic! I don't know if other players felt that way...but the music reminds me of the good old game 'snowboard kids' on the 'nintendo 64'. Good old techno beats :) Latter was my critical point to buy this game!!!",

Pros: - Nice music - Suguri - lots of weapons that are only unlocked by playing - multiple levels filled with death - you will die more times than possible in Dark Souls - you're flying - pew pew - there are online leaderboards so you can compare yourself to scrubs Cons - No death counter to tell you how many times you've failed at a level - You can't take screenshots nor get out of the game window unless it is in windowed mode - Gandhi This game is very fun and despite me not having much time on it im sure ive died almost 100 times (trying to get the acheivment...not on purpose) it's good to play if you're bored and would like to get rekt while having a laugh. Good luck.",

            "review_text": "For the record, I've played other Bullet Hell games so I have my fair share of experience dodging a screen full of projectiles.   I really only have 2 complaints in this game, but these 2 things pretty much sum up the core gameplay elements;     You cannot move and shoot at the same time  unless you're using a pathetically weak weapon. This is the main thing that completely ruins the game for me. Each time you shoot, you fire a shot (that will usually miss unless you're point-blank) and you'll end up getting hit by other projectiles on screen that were fired at you as you were taking your shot at one of the many enemies on screen. It doesn't help that about half the enemies feel like damage sponges, and your more powerful shots are often blocked by their own missile projectiles.    The 'dash' feature (i.e. what the 'focus' feature would be in other bullet hell games that slows your movement and focuses fire) makes you move very quickly and invulnerable to energy-type bullets, but your movement is nonstop and hard to control, making it more than easy to end up crashing into missile-type bullets.  It makes no sense to me as to why the style of gameplay should directly clash with what bullet hell gameplay is set out to be.  It just feels pathetic when I've beaten other bullet hell games (some even on their respective Hard difficulties) yet can't even beat the first level of this game on easy. I gave this game several chances, and despite my fondness of Orange_Juice and its characters, I can't find any enjoyment in playing this game.",

'Easy' on this game translates to 'Nightmare' for just about any other game.",
