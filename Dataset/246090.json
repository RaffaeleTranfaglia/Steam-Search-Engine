            "review_text": "November 2016: Now that the game is not so buggy and it is unoficially supported by the comunity, it is good and I really liked the time I had playing it.  The major problem is the one-unique save-upon-exit (but there is a bypass for it). Permadeath is not a bad idea, since a careful strategist can beat the game and build the 'perfect' base farely easy. BUT the game still has some minor bags (once my 5 guards squad was stuck running on a wall wile 1 intruder was destroying my life support systems, another time the guard with low oxigen in his spaceswit didnt want to follow my waypoint to safty and prefered to suffocate etc). If i had only one save, I would had abandon the game in the obavo acations, writing a rage review.  BUT: I reguraly exit the game and copy-paste the two save files at another folder, so I can paste-overwrite them agan later, to properly handle buggy or annoying situations. That, made the game a really nice experience: A more casual Rimworld type of base building.  I strongly recoment if you go on with SPacebase, to get the unoficial patch 1.08. It adds things in the game and helps for better control of the guards (really useful).  So, I recomment the game, but since the publisher is not supporting it any more and community/freelances do the job instead, I am a bit sceptic about the 10 euro pricing... Check on some gamply videos and comunity feedback, and then deside if you would prefer to wait for a high discount before purchasing this actually good game.  (ps. Rimworld has also still many minor bugs, but the save system is there to make me forget about them...)",

EDIT October 8 2015:  An update rolled out and the game now actually works, I'm greatly enjoying this even though it's mostly basic base building with not too much to do other than assign people to mine, food, build and maintenance.   It's fun but gets kind of dull after a while, I'm now changing my review to positive only due to the fact something has changed and it actually works in an enjoyable way.",

Some of the positives: *You have to actually plan a base and monitor your resources in order to survive *Every play through is different.  *You choose what type of game you plan on embarking on from the very start.  - Do you want a lot of hostiles?  - Do you want to build your base close to a warp gate so you will have visitors (Friendly &amp; hostile?)  - Stellar Density: Do you want to have an abundance of 'money' or do you want to have to really work for it?  Some of the negatives: *Yes, the game is no longer being developed *Yes, there are many things not completed  -The game is still very much playable *Yes, there are many features that should have been added in, via the Devâ€™s constant updates, such as:  -Multi-level base construction  -Teleporters  -holodecks  This game started out as an early access game and unfortunately it also ended that way. The way I see it, anyone on steam, including myself, takes a chance when buying a game that is in early access. Will it be phenomenal? Will it suck? When will development finish? Will it ever finish? Will this new bug fix crash the entire game?   The game may not be 100% complete, but at least Double Fine released the source code to their fans to continue development. Sometimes, it's the fans that understand the game on a much deeper level than the developers ever could.   With that being said, should you purchase this game at $20?  In short...NO WAY!! Should you never play this game though? NO!!! Wait for it to go on sale and purchase once the price drops to a good amount. You can get HOURS AND HOURS of play time out of this game - and isn't that what you want from any game you decide to sit down and play?!?! ",

Sure, it has a couple bugs here and there but people are being way too anal about tis game.  I got 18 ours of fun out of a 20$ indie title so I say it was well worth the purchase.",

At this point I had a blast playing it (even in its alpha state I could easily get 10+ hours of gameplay) and was sure that small balances and tweaks would add a lot to the games value.   I guess would sum it all up to I was not really expecting much. So as It is now I really enjoy the game, with no bias of previously reading dev posts of false promises and what could have been. What it is right now is a modern version of a god game where your in space.... think dwarf fortress meets the sims with a dash of spacestation sim. It does have its bugs and it is a shame that they still exist in the full 1.0 release but I am confident they will patch the problems over time.  As for everyone being hurt by how the devs represented themselves, the game, and double fine, (after reading the many reviews on this game) It really does suck. But Hey - At least it's not Infestation. Or any other of those super scamy games.... you got to admit that this game comes out as something pretty decent, even though it might still be a prototype.",

Two new ships/buildings appeared; one docked in the middle of a room building operation leaving it inaccessible; the other docked on a wall that had a ship engine. I could access the latter by cutting a wall and tearing down the engine to free the main entrance, but the former still inaccessible. - There's a dead raider lying in the room to be the second reactor room. I can not build a power generator since the raider blocks it - seems bodies just don't disappear. I also have a floating dead astronaut in the middle of my bar; he was killed when the room didn't even exist.  I've spent hours in the game but only got frustration out of it - whatever progress I made, disappearing floor tiles, stupid AI, bugs, ... ruined it.

I don't care how great the guys developing Massive Chalice are, they're from the same studio that scamed me out of 25 bucks.  25 dollars, in the grand scheme of things, it isn't much. But there's alot of things I could've done with that 25 dollars, first thing that comes to mind is buy a case of mediocre beer.   Now when I buy a case of Budwieser I expect certian things; I expect bland taste, I expect to get a mild buzz, sounds like a pretty â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ty use of 25 dollars right? Here's the thing, I was never promised anything more.  Lets expand on the beer analogy: instead of Budweiser, DF is now the brewer. DF promises me a pretty nice brew: nothing amazing, but something well worth my money. Having heard DF has produced some quality brews in the past I buy a case from the affable salesman. I take the case home, eager to try a fresh new flavor from the brewer I've heard so many good things about; then I open the first bottle. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, this bottle contains nothing but â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ fumes; disgusted but still hoping to at least drink my initial disgust away I open another bottle..........more â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. So the evening rolls on with me opening up bottle after bottle of DF's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ untill the whole case is gone in the midst of my now pungent apartment I realize: that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ at DF scamed me.  I storm down to the storefront where I bought the not-brew only to find the signs down, the windows shuttered, and a note on the door: closed due to lack of customers.  That's the best way I can think to describe my one and only transaction with DF, they sold me a case of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and said the reason the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ was â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ is because not enough people bought their â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. So I hope you fine folks at DF can understand why the next time someone asks me to spend my money on one of your products, I'll tell you to shove your product up your â™¥â™¥â™¥.",

But here's the gameplay review, if you're still wondering if you should buy it or not :   The game's idea is wonderfull imo : build a base in space, maintain it and welcome new colonists into it while fending off raiders and managing the jobs the citizens do. The way they did it was not bad at all, simple drag-build controlls and assigning the different areas by a simple click of a button and design the interior as you like with various props. Easy. Simple. But the thing that made the game bad is the fact that it's unbalanced, buggy and just unfinished. The A.I is pretty bad in prioritizing their tasks, and with the new mood system there is just no way of keeping them happy, even if you furnish every room and give them their favourite jobs. they all eventualy get depressed and start fighting over nothing, which screws up the whole base and delays tasks as they recover in the sickbay. The gameplay is refined for an Alpha at the time, but there was no change in it whatsoever when it went to V1.0 .  I wouldn't recomend the game to someone who disliked game-breaking bugs and dumb A.I , but if you just like building a base and dont mind using mods to fix all of the vanilla game's problems, it is worth buying whenever it gets on sale. But otherwise, i sadly can'r recommend it, sorry Double Fine, but ya kinda screwed it up here. 4.5/10 ",

The worst part is DoubleFine is playing it off like it's such a wonderful thing, and aren't we all so lucky. Why not just tell us 'Sorry, we didn't get enough money to continue development, but here's what we'll do - giant bugfix/polish patch, release sourcecode. We hope you guys can make the game we couldn't afford to!' That would at least have had the respect for the players and Early Access supporters that seems 'right' to me. Deleting the old 'roadmap' seems particularly dishonest at this point as well.  However, that's just me with my silly morals and standards and respect and honesty. I don't have to run a business and make decisions like 'let's pretend this is great when it's actually crap.' Sorry, DoubleFine, but you've managed to massively damage my opinion of you with the way you're handling this. I know you're just publishing GangBeasts, but there's now NO WAY I'm putting money into that until it's actually finished. And if too many people feel that way, will it stagnate and suffer the same fate as DF-9?  -----  I'll try to make an update to this review once the so-called-1.0 version comes out, and see if it's actually some working skeleton of a game.   As it is now, DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME AT ANY PRICE.   It simply does not work as a game. Stuff happens and your base will die, and there's nothing you can do about it. Just after the latest patch version, I lost an entire base to one raider, because the security team was either standing around and getting shot, or running away (and getting shot). None of them ever bothered to attack the intruder. Not even once. Your base will catch fire from asteroid impacts and your inhabitants will gleefully panic-run right into the flames and die, instead of grabbing the fire extinguishers you've placed across the base and actually doing something constructive. Someone will decide that they absolutely need to do floor pushups right in your airlock door, and then everybody will suffocate to death.  These things are quite forgivable in an alpha game. Frustrating, but understandable. It's alpha, I get it. Things might be broken or unfinished. I'm fine with that. But if ANY of this crap manages to slip into the 1.0 release? That's just garbage.  (Edit: Apparently The S-Word is too raunchy for a review. Sigh.)  ----   1.01 Update   It has improved nothing at all.  No. I absolutely do not recommend. It continues to just  not work . I started two bases today after the 1.01 patch, the one designed to 'finish' the game. I see no significant improvements. Build orders are randomly followed, regardless of importance. Citizens start 'running away' for no obvious reason. Random station boarding parties still utterly annihilate you base regardless of the number of security personnell you have assigned. Security teams clearing derelicts still seem to think that actually shooting the hostiles is a silly concept.  But hey, at least now there's a tutorial! A rather unnecessary one, since the game mechanics are not at all complicated, and I felt were very obviously conveyed through normal play. The problem isn't the players misunderstanding the game mechanics - it's that the game simply  doesn't f-ing work.   ----    Final  Final recommendation:   DO NOT PURCHASE THIS. EVER.   Secondary recommendation:   Never trust DoubleFine again. Only buy a product once it has been actually released, and you've tried it, and it actually works, and the community is being treated well. Do not give support (either financial or social) to companies that make bad decisions. And especially not companies that make bad decisions, then try to tell you how great their decisions actually were.",

            "review_text": "Dissapointing.... Back when the game was in early development I fell victim to its 'appeal'. I saw a game with potential and I was all and all hopeful. In those ealier days the game was riddled with bugs and glitches, and when I found out they were dropping the game and rushing development, I was hopeful they would eliminate those bugs and glitches in the game. So as a review of the official release of version 1.06 here is the breakdown. I'll have a simple review and more in depth... or in this game... anger driven review...  ----- Simple ----  The game is crap... It had so much potential but since it got the axe and a speedy release... it has so many issues. I honestly tried to play the game again... but yet I wasn't able to play longer than 10 minues. I would not recommend this game to anybody unless it's less than a dollar or given to you free. It's buggy... rough to control, and just honestly crap.  ----- Angered Version -----  Graphics: As this is not a 'Highly graphical' game I wouls say they are acceptable. The sprites perform actions that is befiting, and nothing to standoutish. However in aspect of gameplay the 'isometric' angle makes the game difficult to know exactly what is going on. In the typical fashion the walls disappear in a way to allow you to see in the rooms, however being able to roatate the camera would be nice.  Gameplay: This is where the game loses me. Although the controls aren't 'hard' they are difficult in there own way. I've played many builder games, and most games play similarily with minor adjustments to the controls. In more recent terms since the era of shooter games almost every game depends upon the W-A-S-D model. This game doesn't stray too far fram that idea and it feels comfortable... at least until you start building. At that point the game takes a turn for the worst. Edge scrolling doesn't feel like it's in existence, so your dependant upon the WASD model, but once you open the construction menu, foul language fills the mouth as when you click with your mouse to select the item and press 'D' to move your contruction item changes. As soon as that construction menu comes up the game shifts from a comfortable WASD model to a point and click model. This wouldn't be a problem if they didn't establish you could use the WASD in the first place.... So that is annoying. Then it gets worse. As you play you decide to speed up the game, and most games using some button near the WASD (tab, 123, something) changes the game speed, but in comes the mouse model, and you have to click the speed options. Now I wouldn't have an issue with this, if it wasn't for the fact that when any ship arrived or any notification appears the game switches back to speed 1.... and DOES NOT RETURN.....I find it quite annoying because I'll be in the middle of waiting for my characters to build a room... then all the sudden a message... then the question, 'Why are my guys moving so slow'... then oh gotta click that speed... then the game goes NOPE... and another message. It just continually pesteres you until you get so angry that you give up.  AI: I don't normally judge AI as it's always an issue with all games. It is always about finding that right balance between what the computer needs to process and what the character prioritizes.... unfortunately it appears that this game said, 'F*$k it... have the guys do whatever.' And like loyal programs they do whatever. You have absolutely no control over the individual character, so when your trying to finish that bed... your have to wait until the game decides... 'know what I think I should build that bed.' But at that point your characters are now falling over because they are so tired... that they have no energy... then get depressed and not want to work... so now that bed will never get done.... it annoying the bleeping crap out of me as I was just trying to enjoy the game.  Glitches and Bugs: Yes I'm bringing it up... as a 'fully' released game you would expect most of the bugs and glitches to be taken care of... in fact thats what most of the follow up forums established... but know what.... turns out that your characters get stuck (dumb AI) and because you can't do that they sufficate.... yeah... so just started finished the basic build... airlock... air... and such... but oh no... two of my guys just sat there... doing... NOTHING... could it be AI? probably... but to me that's a bug. But it's not the worst oh no... in my honest to goodness no opinion try I got 'invaded' another ship attached itself to me, and I was assulted. After killing the AI I noticed, Hey there is a gun outside... Then I slowly watched one of my security guards go out to take care of it.... two shots later dead.... ok..... so what does the AI do? 'Well he's dead... probably should take care of that... but naa....' Guess where my miners had to go to get resources? Right in the line of fire.... so there goes two of my miners... Well maybe I can control a security... oh wait can't control the guys so whoops... maybe set a security point for them.... nope... dead... dead and dead..... I'm happy they incorperated the guns for defences... but when a gun is established as enemy and even if you took over everything it appears that that guns still acts hostile.... My frustrations knows no bounds.  Overall the game is fine.... just fine.... not great... not good... just fine.... if you want something new to distract you for 10 minutes... here is the perfect game for you... but don't buy unless it's on uber sale.... and by uber sale like... I dunno $0.99 per copy... or heck maybe if the company pays you to play... becuase honestly this game isn't worth anything more.",

Someone will freak over something, probably quickly, and go around smashing half of the base until someone else smashes them in the face enough times that they pass out.

            "review_text": "Lets leave aside the fact that the game isn't finished, shall we? Double fine decided its done, so lets look at this as a finished product  Spacebase DF-9 is The Sims, but in space. I know what youre thinking, I was hyped too. You can assign different jobs to different citizens and theyll like it a certain amount. Your citizens will scurry around and converse with each other about inane things like space mudcrabs. You can select asteroids to be mined, which works kinda. You can get other people to come by and ask to join your space-hovel, and supposedly they might even try to do other things, but that never happened in my playthrough. You can send you citizens to go and explore derelict ships, and they will find things. You can build rooms, and put things in those rooms, and your citizen will use them. You can give those rooms different named functions, and your citizen will use them for those functions. Spacebase DF-9 is The Sims, but in space.  Pros:  -Aesthetic: If you can count on Double Fine for anything, its that their stuff always looks good. The semi-retro looks of the interface and the hand drawn aliens look nice and stylized. Sending your citizens off to investigate a derelict ship is always a harrowing affair, as the ship is completely dark, with red warning lights flashing ominously through the hallways. Even if you have no idea whats coming, the atmosphere of the ship makes you anticipate losing a few citizens. One fult is that the play space looks very flat, even though your citizens, while in space suits, can go under your space-hovel, which was very confusing the first few times.  -Sound: The soundtrack is short but nice. Ambient trance music has a soft spot in my ear canal, but I found the music very nice, even though it will be seen as repetitive to some. If you dont like, it, you can always mute it and play Eminem, or what have you.  -Core gameplay: The game mechanics I described above are very good, and makes the base of a great sim game. I'll elaborate more on this in the negatives.  -Fun alien designs: I like the designs of the aliens. I didnt see two aliens who looked exactly alike in my playthrough, besides the two humans I started with. Reminds me of Star Wars!  Negatives:  -It isn't Psychonauts. Lets all face facts, the main reason we all buy Double Fine games is in hopes of another wacky, fun game like Psychonauts. It doesnt need to be a Psychonauts game, it just needs to have the same spirit (Although, I'm still holding out hope that if I keep buying DF games, they'll eventually make Psychonauts 2). The plain fact of the matter is that this has none of that spirit. Spacebase DF-9 is as sterile a gaming experience as there is to be found. The most funny thing I did was purposefully suffocate my citizens in the bar. Forshame, Double Fine.  -The gameplay is completely flat. As in grossly, sadly, boringly flat. If you have played 30 minutes of DF-9, you have played 30 hours of DF-9. With the exeption of the rare derlict ships, I spent most of my game watching netflix on the other monitor. Even the derelict ships suck in a way, since even with their mystery, it takes too much time and resource to explore and kill the monsters inside for it to be worth it, since all your citizens will be terrible at fighting. In other games, like the Sims 4, this could be remedied with patches and DLC, but Double Fine has no intention to patch or make DLC for this game, and so were tuck with the husk of a potentially great game.  Ending score: 4/10. A passable game that works just fine but because of its pedigree should be a while lot better than it is. If you really need your fix of a Space Station simulation game, try Space Colony on GOG, if you need a Sims-esque game, just go back to the Sims. If you want a fun Double Fine game, just play Psychonauts or Brutal Legend again.",

My advice to the creators: you should have looked to games like Evil Genius to get a better understanding of what's wrong.  Some things that bothered me while playing:  - no prioritization system in place for construction ( example: watching your workers finish building an empty room before constructing an oxygen recycler can be frustrating, especially when people start asphyxiating) - I watched a worker box themselves into a sealed room and then remove her suit. Instead of finishing the job and building a door to gain access to the base, she preffered to starve to death.

In addition to the blogpost I'd like to add an other reason why NOT to buy DF9. Once again the AI, which just plain sucks! My personal experience with the AI sucking balls is that after a debris stike, my oxigen tanks and power supply got hit. Without power and oxigen, the whole crew starts to panic, including the whole technical team. WTF? You guys should run to the power supply and oxigen tanks to fix them instead of running around like headless chickens!  An other problem is the Sims part of the game. The people have a (hidden!) worklist of stuff they have to do. So far so good I'd say. But technical maintenance (yes once again) should have a top priority for lifesupport, but noooo..... Ocigen tanks are about to break down and they fix ...a bar stool... FFS guys get real please! Or at least let me point the Sims where they should go next instead of fully automated.

I've had two starts where everyone suffocated in their space suits because they took a million years to actually get around to building oxygen recyclers when ordered, and another where everyone suffocated because they refused to build an airlock to actually get into the mini-station they'd just built. When you order a squad of security officers to move to an area with raiders in, it's a coin flip whether or not all of them will actually go there. I lost one citizen and one of my two officers to a raider attack when one of the officers decided to - I â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you not - stand around playing a handheld game instead of actually doing his job and shooting the raider that just killed someone.

I also understand that development takes a long time, and isn't exactly the smoothest ride, so after a while I uninstalled and just let it sit for a while. Seeing it just get officially released, I decided to check in on it again and find that, really, not much has changed. I'm disappointed in the scarcity of things to do - it's a game of 'build each facility, bam you're done', when it comes down to it, like the tablet versions of city builders such as SimCity/Metropolis/Anno/etc. Just not much to it.  I don't recommend it simply because it's not worth playing more than once, and I'm not happy paying for something like that. Even the most single-player of experiences I tend to come back to after a while, but SpaceBase didn't have anything to it that made me say 'yeah, I'll pick it back up after I play this or that'.

Game has a lot of potential! However it is still lacking. The base building is a little hard to get used to but works well, there are no clear markings for what does what when you try to build an item. No way to move items you place. Lots of bugs including: engineers don't like to repair things. all your oxygen recyclers can be at 0% and they wont bother with it (same with doors) until it explodes half the time. For so reason security officers wont move to the beacons you place, but when they do they usually go outside under the base at the spot the beacon was placed instead of inside so it's VERY hard to defend your base. Works wont work half the time. Lastly in regards to bugs my middle room for no reason what so ever went down to 40% O2 and all my guys got stuck in the room next to the air lock (which had 70% O2). So I quite and came back hoping that would fix the bug, and every single room suddenly went to 0% O2 and half the people were already dead. the other 98% suffocated. saved and went back now my rooms are back to 98% O2 and 2 people survived. then one became a parasite and everyone died can't retake.  Now that's a lot of bugs and problems yes. BUT I had a lot of fun playing the game none the less. I hope these bugs get fixed and I hope the game does great.

And that makes me sad because I want it to be great. I would love to spend WEEKS modding the Lua code that makes Spacebase-DF9 work, but I'm not going to make an incomplete game complete because that would be Double Fine's job. It has unfixed bugs. The AI needs a lot of work. It needs a lot of spit polish. When I tried to mod it, it crashed.  I'm genuinely a little puzzled why Double Fine is just letting this languish on the market. I liked it enough to write a bunch of words about it. But the early access never hit critical mass and the dev pulled the plug.",

I bought the game with no expectations tho, and bought it after the release because the other game looked like it would interest me also (havn't played it yet).  I would not recommend this game to anyone, unless the price is 5 dollars. even then it is a very nich game with tons of flaws.  The problem is this game was supose to be something special, and it isn't. It is very shallow and depends on others to complete what they started. People to tend to make great games better because it is worth more of their time; which this is not. I hope someone out there is making an awesome mod that will make this something special, but i doubt anyone with the skills to do so would even use their time on this.  I hate the lack of content, others hate that they do not quite understand what is going on or how to control it. Which feels valid to me because i spent to the time to understand most of it, and i just felt robbed of time. It all just felt so simple, just tell me how shelves, doing the same jobs, rugs, storage lockers, ect work. I am starting to get annoyed by this tatic of hidding basic information to pad out the game. show me the core game mechanics please.  I should beable to: -do job rotations because people get annoyed by doing the same jobs. -save past job selections because the way things are set up now it takes forever to do this. -easly see and select vancant beds, and people that need them -select non leathal for my basemates, and lethal for raiders in the security tab. -set diffrent parts of my base as diffrent work areas for my guys, so i can expand without AI glitches and properly expand my base or even have bases. -recall workers to a room, or atlease the base when there is an attack. -have a happyness tab, to show how many people are feeling a certain way. -to know what the hell a rug/plant does. I am sure it improves happiness, but I dono.  This is not a bad game, but it is just the core of what makes a good game. It needs more, alot more.",

I played the game whil it was still being toted in Alpha and it was a clunky mess with no tutorial. While I was able eventually able to navigate the cumbersome menu setup and get the base setup the game just kinda plateaued at that point and just never got very interesting.  Eventually a tutorial of sorts was added but it had a persistent bug that prevented it from being completed. No matter what was done the tutorial messages would persist on the screen despite having completed the objective.  Bottom line, avoid this title at all costs.",

I bought this as a bundle with Hack 'n' Slash, which is on a discount which makes me only spending less than 1 cent for this game.  This game started as a good game, with a great concept and all, about building your own spacebase. You have no limitations, and there are a lot of things to construct while keeping balance with residents' needs. However, this game is very confusing at a start, with so few tutorial (and it has a more detailed, although still not cover most of it, in a separate section on the main menu, which makes it worse). The actual game is actually like an endless mode, which give you everything you need to build at the start and a few resident to start with.  Honestly, i hardly can come up with a good and a bad aspect with this game. This game is actually an okay game if you have understand on how to play it, but there isn't anything appealing to it. There are some 'goals' to be accomplished, but i don't really think it's that important, or maybe the game doesn't really show it as important.  Pros: - Lots of items and room variations to build - You can assign your resident to do various jobs and raise their experience  Cons: - Assigning a bed to each person one by one can be very tiring, especially if you have a lot of residents. - No 'undo' button after doing a construction 'blueprint' - No rotate button  Should you buy this game? If you like this type of game, this game can be very cheap when it's on sale, which is good. But if you don't, just skip it.",
