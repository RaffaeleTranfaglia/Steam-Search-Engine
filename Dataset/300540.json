            "review_text": "At first glance, Sweet Lily Dreams appears to be cute and sweet so one would think that the story would be pretty tame. However, as you delve further into the game, you find out that first appearances are not what they appear. Sweet Lily Dreams (SLD) tells the story of a girl named Lily who somehow ends up away from her dream and enters the dream world city known as Rosaria. She meets up with Faith and Curly-the former of whom is actually the main protagonist-and later with Muggles. Together, the four of them set off to enter the various dream worlds to eradicate phobius-the evil dream creatures-and basically to cleanse the dream worlds of evil. The dream worlds are based on popular stories so Lily, having come from the real world, will be quite knowledgeable about them. Basically, the story itself is about finding The Writer, who's causing all of these dream worlds to be thrown off balance but once he's found, the question pops up on whether he's really evil or if there's something else motivating his actions. And what is Faith's relationship to The Writer? That's the basic gist of the story.  SLD uses an old school RPG turn-based battle system so the player has to strategically determine how to attack the various phobius that are encountered. This is the main gameplay of SLD. Three of the four playable characters do learn spells upon levelling up in the early levels of the game although to learn the majority of spells, the player has to make use of the crafting feature. I like this feature quite a lot. The player can find the items for crafting in chests, on the ground, or as rewards from battling phobius as well as buy the required items. The types of spells that the player can craft are elemental, healing, and defensive. The battles themselves require quite a bit of strategy. Of course, it's important to have restorative items and such but in terms of spells, the kind of spell the player uses on a phobius can greatly affect how challenging the battle will be. For instance, a phobius that uses fire-based spells is weak against a party member that uses ice-based spells so having this knowledge can make all the difference in how the player can approach battles.  In addition to the above, there are a couple of features that made SLD unique from other RPGs. First, Lily is a customizable character in that she can be equipped with an elemental power and a defensive dress from the start. More elemental powers and dresses can be bought later in the Points Extravaganza shop in Rosaria. The items that can be purchased in this shop can turn out to be advantageous when they are placed in Lily's house. (Yes, Lily does get her own house in Rosaria!) Depending on the majority of items that are bought (most of the items represent an elemental power), they can give the party a boost such as raising defense, increasing attack power during battles, etc.  In regards to the art, it's quite beautiful and it wouldn't be obvious at first glance that SLD was made with RPG Maker. A lot of games made with such an engine tend to look aesthetically boring since the same sprites, map tiles, etc., tend to be used over and over. However, this isn't the case here. There was a lot of customization done on SLD, which clearly reflects how much hard work was put into making it a great game.   I could go on about the other aspects that I loved but I think I covered the most important points. Overall, I really liked SLD and the features and quests (both main and side) kept me engaged for hours. I almost forgot to mention this but once you finish the game, there is incentive to going back and playing it again. Once you've completed the game once, it will start on a New Dream+ mode which allows you to have access to special items and such that weren't available during your first playthrough.  So if you're a fan of RPGs, I highly recommend trying out SLD. Or even if you're new to RPGs, SLD is a good introduction to what they're like and how much fun they can be. ^^",

            "review_text": "Not quite sure how to describe this game: it's a bit unusual. There are more than a few moments that leave you wondering if you're playing a game designed specifically for preteen girls XD (case in point: the team is made up of 3 females and an agendered plushie LOL)  Fair amount for completionists - best to focus on not touching those green healing orbs OR going for max points - but you do get more points up for grabs in a playthrough than the achievement requires.  It's a reasonably well thought out game, actually, and Sleepy Hollow, Dracula's castle and Dr. Jekyll's manor were charming surprises. The mini games are also a welcome distraction, especially the alchemy pipe tilting to make potions ^_^ The last level and the plot in general leave a good few questions, but i haven't played whisper of a rose to get a better idea of where the whole 'caretech and idream' story is going now that Rosaria is all settled. The characters are memorable, but their trials and personal struggles seem a bit forced, i think it would benefit from being a longer game :)  I admit this game as a fairly guilty pleasure and would like to see where it goes next.",

            "review_text": "This is going to be a mixed review. I got this game off of a recent Humble Bundle. To tell you the truth, it didn't look that interesting. I finally got tired of it sitting in my library so I decided to pick it up.  The main character of the story is named Lily. She is tucked to bed my ber mother and she asks, 'When will daddy be home?' The mother replies, 'He will be working late tonight, but you can see him tomorrow.' Lily says, 'Then I don't want to go to sleep.' The mother thinks for a moment and replies, 'Then you can see your father in your dreams.' The main game takes place within Lily's dreams, and the three main characters are Lily, a talking dog, and a talking cat.  Exploration mechanics could be tweaked a bit to make it more sturdy, but they are fine.  Battle mechanics are pretty basic for a RPG game. Simple attack, skills, items, defend, and run options are available in battle.  Overall, this game was clearly intended for 10 year old children. I would recommend getting this for you daughter, but not for yourself.",

            "review_text": "Sweet Lily Dreams is an older fashioned RPG Maker game that uses various Folk Stories and childrens books from different countries and creates an intricate game play story. The knowledge and background research for these various stories helps to make the game flow smoothly between worlds and stories. The various dreams brought up are common among almost every young child and adults fears or insecureties. Whether it is facing a blood sucking Dracula in Transalvania, to chasing witches in Russia, or even running with the headless horseman, the story will keep your heart racing. The game has maybe one or two scary moments, but it really not a scary game to most. Sweet Lily Dreams is like every game and has some minor flaws to it that can detere some people from the game. I had some problems myself, but to be honest most of them were cused by me. Many areas are maze like maps that have to be navigated through while dealing with respawning enemies. This actually helped me stay a few levels ahead of the bosses and made the game easier. However, it gets annoying trying to traverse some areas and not knowing how to get through them (again, most of them were my fault). Patience is a must with this game and requires you to think outside the box. Some of the side quest puzzles can also be hard if you are not very good with certain types of puzzles, but are rewarding when you do solve them. All in all Sweet Lilly Dreams is a decent game for hard core RPG Maker Fans who are looking for a different take on the RPG genera. The game is not super long, taking anywhere from 20-40 hours, depending on how much of the game you decide to explore (puzzles and sidequests) I would greatly recommend this to anyone who is willing to try the game out and is a fan of older RPGs. With some patience and understanding of the mechanics even new fans can be made with this decent take on Folk Lore and childrens books. 7.5/10",
