Like most Shmups the game is short, but the funny narration, multiple modes, and progressive difficulty will give you enough reason to play this game a lot more than once. When it comes to enjoyable Shmups worth your time, I'd give it a 9/10.",

            "review_text": "This game was fun for a playthrough with a friend. It wasn't very long, but it was very challenging. It took about 5 hours to beat. For $4, you can keep a game that would probably cost about $4 worth of quarters to play through one time at the arcade.  Pros: Good music, nice graphics, hilarious dialogue Cons: Hard game. Not casual whatsoever. Fairly short.",

The fact that it's so cheap, and includes tons of awesome Steam features, is all just gravy on top of a really fun hori shmup! I also absolutely love the mission control narrator -- so f'in hilarious!  All in all, a very nice game -- with nice graphics, UI, and sound too!",
