            "review_text": "I have many hours in this game before it came to Steam but I did put some hours into the steam version before writing my review to check for any changes, added or missing features, performance issues, etc. Spellstone is a very fun game that you can enjoy as a f2p player but just be prepared to hit a paywall like in many other mobile games. There are monthly individual events as well as weekly guild events or individual events to participate in. The best part of the game for me is the guild aspect and events which can be alot of fun especially when you find a good guild that is active and helpful. There are also BGE's that add a special ability to a particular tribe for a certain amount of time which make the cards from that tribe more powerful. Now for the negative stuff. Cards are split into a standard set (cards that anyone can get) and a premium set (cards that must be purchased with real $) which creates a huge power gap between f2p and p2w because the premium set cards are much stronger. The huge issue which you should notice pretty quickly is that the prices in this game are RIDICULOUSLY expensive. The cards come in the usual common, rare, epic, legendary variety and two cards can be combined to make a dual version or four cards can be combined to make the top level quad version of the card, so as an example the in game store sells boxes which contain 4 copies each of 6 legendary cards and 8 copies each of 6 epic cards. To buy out the whole box and guarantee yourself 6 quad legendaries and 12 quad epics will cost you just over $300. The cards in the box will be mostly from the tribe that are currently part of the bge so while this will make your deck stronger for a while, once the bge ends most of the cards you bought won't even be playable anymore. While the bge effects are interesting and fun to play they are also meant to make players purchase more cards from that faction to compete within the bge. Powercreep is also a serious issue, cards that you pay money for will be overpowered by new box cards usually within a few months. There are also chance packs which give you 1 of any card in the pack (but with no set amount of each card) so you could spend hundreds of $ and not even be able to quad one of the cards that you really wanted. There is also an emporium that has 4 slots with each containing one item for sale, however this is only available to vips and each slot unlocks at a certain vip level (based on how much $ you have spent) but to have access to all 4 items you will need to spend THOUSANDS of $$$$, and after all of that 4 copies of a legendary card from the emporium to make a quad will cost you $100. My least favorite thing though has to be that you can purchase refills with real money for some of the 'competitive' individual and guild events, so say that you've put together a really good deck and played awesome during an event and you're in a good ranking that will land you a decent reward, well someone can just open their wallet right at the end and buy their way past you..... really? This is a fun game and can be enjoyable for f2p players but make sure that you know what this game is all about before spending your money here and if you're looking for a good f2p game that you can spend a few $ here and there on to show your support, this is not it.",

            "review_text": "The games are very well made every cards are cool but the 1st problem is if you dont have money in this game you cant win because other addicted player have premium pay to win cards your free to play cards cant win against premium. The 2nd problem is you cant play long because everytime you play your energy exhaust when you fight you have to wait every 15 to 30 minutes to play against different players or ai. The 3rd problem is when you buy DLC you dont get it because of the bug you have to send a ticket to get your DLC i only recommend this for rich player who spend thousand of dollars.",

            "review_text": "This game is a terrible excuse to give the company that created it money. Thier starter package costs more than most brand new games from good publishers on the market at $99.99. Advancement is arduously slow. The game interface is confusing and feels like you have to swim through advertising in order to get to gameplay. Deck construction is overly simplified. This is a porly assembled pay-to-play easy card game that has amazing art.",

            "review_text": "I have been playing spellstone for a while now on mobile devices and through the web interface. I have to admit that I really like this version of the game and it will likely be my preferred way to play when I'm at my PC. Sure, there a few things I have to get used to (like it takes up the whole screen and a wider view), however the responsiveness of the application is great when compared to the unity web plug-in on PC. Great job optimizing it for Steam and desktop application.  Just to layout the concept a little for those who don't play or reading other review, espeically those that say it is only play to win... There are three standard deck sets... standard (free), reward (from in-game events), and finally premium (pay... alot). While I use cards from each category (yes, I am a pay to win player), I know many players that stick with the free to play (f2p) and reward cards and do very well and enjoy the game.  Also, there is live Player vs Player... it is the Arena.  Overall... good job Synapse. I hope the Steam version continues to be as responsive and well done as the game continues to grow.",

            "review_text": "Fast, fun card game that you can cross-play on your phone. The competitive events to win prizes solo and as guilds are a great hook to get you logging in daily. They do have daily log-in bonuses and stages/pvp to grind if you want to play cash free. I myself dropped cash on the game because i enjoy the fact i can get in a number of games at work and then relax with it at home. I threw $20 on a weekly special that got me some competive cards right out of the gate because of how much i like this game. They will entice you to spend more with dealshere and there and a VIP system that raises your cap energy depending on how much you have spent.   Try it out! You have nothing to lose. Unless you have no self control and are an impulse spender. I my self am going to treat ths game like an mmo and give myself a $10-15 monthly budget.  The only thing i find myself wishing for in this game is a Ranked livePVP montly setup like Hearthstone. My deck is somewhere in the middle so i either run people over or get blown away when i play the livePvP. They do have a PvP system where you play against computer controlled versions of players decks and rank up but it has a energy timer on it where the live PvP you can play as much as you want.",

            "review_text": "An extremely simplistic casual card game. You can almost immediately tell it's a mobile game with the oversized buttons and recharging energy bs we've all come to expect from f2p mobile games. You regenerate 1 energy every 10 minutes. In the early game, probably for the first hour or so, you level up so quickly that you hardly see your energy completely gone. Once you reach the first hour or so and complete a few quests, waiting for energy is a bummer and you pretty much have to buy more with real $ or wait for 2 hours at a time to have any sort of fun.   There is a pvp arena where you fight other players, and this is pretty fun too. Getting rare cards is pretty easy so you won't find yourself constantly losing to p2w players. This game is definately p2w though. There's no argument there. I've gone up against players with max level heroic heroes with fully maxed out cards and didn't stand a chance, literally not a chance. Thankfully, most players in this game don't have that so you have some fun every once in awhile.   Just keep in mind that after your first hour, the fun starts to wear off.",
