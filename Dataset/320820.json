            "review_text": "The Bad: The game is repetitive. Now, a lot of game are repetitive - the whole of Half Life (an absolute classic everyone should play) is variations on a theme, when you get to gameplay. The same holds true for other incredible classics across many genre: Metroid, any given SHMUP, all the Diablo-Likes ever made (including all the Diablos), the LoZ series, and so it goes.  There's a distinct difference between good-repetitive and bad-repetitive. Good-repetitive has strong narrative, vast variation, or an intrinsic value in the repeated mechanic (think Tetris).   Toren is pretty awesome, but it doesn't have that - it has Bad Repetitive: the same goal, mechanic, and so on repeated ad nauseum. So why do I reccomend it? Well...  The Good Beautiful. Don't get me wrong - it won't kill your gaming PC. Hell, I can play it on my laptop, which is not... you know, fantastic.  That having been said, the design is fantasic, and clearly optimized. It won't kill your PC, but it will look as intended, and that look is great.  The controls are perfect for what they're meant for. Never once did I accidentally do something other than what I meant to do. Now, I'm a klutz and I literally can't play Parappa because I can't keep the locations of particular buttons in my head... and this still applied. The controls are as close to perfect as you can get.  Also, the intent probably isn't challenge. It's an adventure (akin to the old Sierra games like KQ, SQ, PQ, and AQ), not an action title, and there's nothing in the game that's not pretty clearly meant to be solved within a few attempts.  So, what you have (when you get right down to it) is a blend of point-and-click adventure, exploration game, and walking sim. It's interesting, captivating, and, as far as I can tell, unique.  If you don't mind a game that's low on action, high on visual art and exploration, and isn't really challenging, then this might be your thing. I know it's mine.  4 out of 5, but try to get it on sale.",

            "review_text": "6.5/10  genre : action/adventure   The story is about a young girl named Moonchild, whose goal in the game is to climb a tower known as Toren. As you progress you see the character age from infant to a grown woman.  + beautiful art design, original score, although the storytelling is dark , the environments are colourfull and well designed (most of the time), Moonchild is also very nicely presented with some great animations, especially when seeing her age from infant to a grown woman. + excellent soundtrack, good voice acting from the narrator + gameplay wise the game is an adventure game in 3rd person with some puzzles and platform elements - the story is explained through scrolls of poetry - you enter in your dreams where most of the time gameplay is a mix between stealth (you have to avoid some ghosts/monsters) and platforming - the puzzles are simple and are usually solved by using the environment - there is also some light combat where you have to defeat the dragon. + although a controller is recommended , i played with mouse and keybort just fine + you might want to replay the game to understand it better  - although the presentation is nice, there are some bugs and glitches in the graphics (known from many games that use this unity engine), also some cutscenes are of low quality reminding ps2 graphics - no voice acting for the main character, which i guess is intentional and inspired by games such as ico, but i didn't find it fitting this game - short duration, it's a 3-4 hours game even if you watch and read everything - lots of bugs related to character's movement, like climbing invisible ledges , making platforming frustrating at times where it shouldn't and making you loose immersion - stealth and puzzles are basic, lacking any challenge at all   It's hard not to recommend this game, only because it's obvious that the team behind it is very talented with some fresh ideas - on the other hand, games shouldn't be released early with so many bugs and glitches , they should have taken their time , the game seems unfinished both technically and story wise.   Still i recommend the game to those enjoying games like this (and it's exactly what you think it is from the description and trailers on the store page) and i encourage the developers to keep up developing unique games like this, maybe being more careful in the technical aspects this time.",

If you don't have a lot of video-games and don't have high standards, you might really appreciate this game! If you want cool sword fighting or parkour with your art (like me) or have a good sized steam library including many other 3rd person action games (like me) you might also dislike this game.

A game that is a victory for Swordtales by reaching the end of an ambitious project to an  independent studio  (and publish it with a publisher on Steam and PS4). Toren is an  interactive tale  focusing on a brief and  beautiful story  about our passage through life. It has an  excellent art direction and mood , as well as beautiful and poetic texts and  a message  that it pays to be transmitted. I missed  more ~game~  in Toren. For me, the game should be what it was during the  final level  and its outcome. There are technical problems in Toren, like textures and animations, but are completely acceptable because it is an indie project. In some levels, I felt that the design was a little frustrating. Nevertheless, for its price, it is a  very fair  product. The end of Toren is magnificent (also visually) and his message is  very deep . For a game that  is a story , it must be remembered for that and will  inspire  and be a reference for other  moon children  in Brazil.",

That said, I've been longing to play this game for about 2 or 3 years.  For some people that don't know the story of the development, or even how the industry is going in this country, it can be easy to bash on the small bugs and defects, and deem the game as a low quality small game that could be on mobiles on something like that - but let's be rational, this game is incredible!  Keeping things short, why you should buy this game:  + It has great atmosphere, brought by nice graphics and level design, amazing soundtrack, and a story full of symbolism and philosophical references. At times, it reminded me of games like Dark Souls (for the architectures and somber scenes), and Shadow of Colossus. + The gameplay is simple, yet fluid and smooth. The game may have some clunky camera and controls, but you get used to it very early in the game. + It plays quickly, reminding the style of Journey, for it feels better to go through the entire game in one playthrough, as if seeing a film.  Why you may not want to play this game:  - It is very short and without many factors that would increase replayability. - It is a simple game in terms of mechanics, don't expect much beyond some puzzles, exploration, and a boss battle every now and then. - Sometimes you have to kill animals.",

There were times though where it felt like the game was over, then you would go to a next level. This happened a few times which felt a bit weird to me. There were also a few bugs such as infinitely dropping at points and kept freezing.   Is it worth a purchase? The puzzles and the feel of the platformer was smooth, I'd say it get just for that alone. The story is forgettable, but not in a bad way. I enjoyed the few hours spent playing it. Full controller support, recommended to use a controller with and my Xbox One controller performed well.  Other than that I'd give it a solid 6.5/10, worth the purchase.",

Simply load the last checkpoint to solve it. The hard one is when you simple can not climb up. And this sucks very much. To solve it you have to close the game and restart it again.

            "review_text": "Let me just start off by saying, I appreciate this game for exisiting. There's a certain charm to be found in games like this that don't exist anywhere else. Charm that exists in the game's stunning environmental visuals, and soundtrack. Games like Ico, or Shadow of the Colossus seems to have had some sort of impact on how this game came into fruition, and because of that I can say I'd rather live in a world where this game was made, than not.  With that out of the way, I need to address some issues I have with the game overall. While the visuals are beautiful, character models seem to have not had the same attention to detail put into them as everything else. Character animations feel rough, as do the cutscenes, and a lot of the time, the main character had an expression on her face that I can only describe as goofy. Also, the way the story is presented could have used some work as well. There's seems to be a lot of interesting lore hidden throughout the world to better explain everything for those willing to dig deeper, but I myself couldn't really find anything to latch onto, and that's due in part to the shortness of the game.   Concepts for puzzle solving are introduced through tutorial segments, but are rarely ever used again, and that's a shame because there were plenty of opportunities for them to branch out beyond what the game had. Combat felt sluggish, hitting enemies never felt that satisfying, and platforming felt really floaty. Sound effects could have also used some more work, since I got tired of hearing that dragon's screech consistantly.  Despite all this though, I still found the game worth buying at a sale price. There was a lot here that I really enjoyed, and despite my minor gripe about the length of the game, the hidden backstory does encorage multiple playthroughs, that wouldn't be a chore to go through due to the length of the game. I don't hate this game at all, and I do highly recommend checking it out. It's one of the better indie games I've played this year, and I'd love to see this company go and make something else to showcase their talent even further. But for 10 dollars, I'd suggest waiting for some sort of price drop like I did.",

Will you be looking top-down? Will the view pan slowly when you turn, or spin uncontrollably like a toddler on a sugar rush? You just don't know.  About the point I realized that I was going to drop my sword REPEATEDLY in EACH battle and have to find it WHILE DODGING DRAGONFIRE, crippled by the control scheme and the camera, I gave up. Pity. It seemed like an interesting (if cryptic) story, and I wanted to see how it came out. Maybe I'll go look up a synopsis somewhere.  This could be a fairly good adventure/story game. Its platformer aspects are bearable. But the sort of combat sequences they've put in here to pad out the play time simply don't work, especially when after every death you have to endure a cutscene of Platitudes From The Old Dead Guy - just long enough that pressing Space to skip it doesn't really help - then two minutes of running/climbing back to where you died.

It feels too short overall for the full price, but it is a beautiful game with a unique story. It's a bit confusing at times what's going on with the story, but the jist is that you're Moonchild, a girl who is destined to return night to her world which has been cursed with eternal sunlight protected by a dragon. You have to climb the tower with the Tree of Life and slay the dragon to bring back the night.   It's a pretty cool game, but like I said, it's short. My only other complaint is that at times the controls feel off. They seem to lag just a second behind the button press sometimes, or last a second too long. Luckily this isn't a game where that generally means the difference between life and death, but it's a little bit annoying.   Overall, I recommend it, but probably not for the full $9.99. Get it on sale if you can.",

            "review_text": "Toren is a brief, uneven game. Sometimes it shows flashes of brilliance, and others it feels extremely derivative.  The art in the game is sometimes beautiful, and sometimes your eye is drawn to what feels like are out of place modeling or textures that are much lower resolution than their surroundings making them pop out. Sometimes there are graphical errors with the main characters clothing textures.  The animation is fluid, and the controls for the most part feel spot on, but then sometimes such as jumping and when the camera is really touchy and trying to stay behind the character in the dream sequences, the controls falll apart, and feel floaty and unresponsive.  The mythology has the starts of interesting, but never really gets fleshed out, and in the telling is really confusing.   I think the game feels like a would-be spiritual successor to ICO (but not Shadows of the Colossus), that could have used more time in the cooker. It's uneven, and overall mediocre, but the game is still worth picking up for the flashes of brillliance it does have in it's short playtime.  Another note: I was able to beat the game twice and get all of the achievements in 3 hours, but ended up having to idle the game over night to get the rest of the trading cards for it, so keep that in mind when looking at my play time. It is a really short game, but the drop rate of the steam trading cards needs to be adjusted to reflect that.",

It could have been much more polished, and those fantastic views and models deserve some better textures, really.   Still, I'm voting it up. If you're looking for a beautiful and psychodelic platformer-puzzle with a non-trivial themes - it's for you. Just do not expect any combat. There's none to be found. That cool-looking Sword from the trailer is just for show. Mostly. ;)",
