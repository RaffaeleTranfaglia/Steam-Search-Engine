            "review_text": "This review is coming from somebody who only has a mouse and keyboard (basically just keyboard for this game) and beat the entire game.  The concept of the game is decent enough to keep you playing, the legnth is roughly 6 hours and the difficulty curve is simple enough to grasp at all points in the game. There are some MAJOR MAJOR flaws with this game though, however, its not enough to give it a 4/10, I would rate this game a 6.5 making it a game that I enjoyed moderately.   The problem with this game lies in its final stages, clunky control and hit and miss gameplay, literally.   Final stages: The last boss will send you to anger management. It is the most uninspired fight i have ever seen and is reminiscent of a bad crash bandicoot boss fight. The final stages are also painful to play for a keyboard gamer (controller players seem to be ok) seeing as you need to be very precise with your aiming and control of the character.  Clunky control: If you preform the same action twice the results may not be the same. If you line your character up with a specific warp or you choose to throw an item the item may just wind up doing different things due to the physics engine; now don't get me wrong, in some games this may be good, however, in this game it is unforgiving and frustrating at times.  I still recommend this game simply because throughout all of my rage, and at times fun gameplay i still finished it, despite origin and whatnot. The game never crashed and never loaded slowly (and I loaded A LOT, TRUST ME.)   TL;DR: 6.5/10 Not great, not bad, precisely average. Pick it up if its ever on sale, 10 is a wee bit over what I would think this should cost.",

I've only just started to scratch the surface and I'm really impressed with the mechanics. The teleporting system is cool and it's really great that you can choose whether or not to be a giant ♥♥♥♥♥♥. The EA Login is a massive pain in the ♥♥♥, but it's a one off thing and doesn't really matter. You can literally just put in a fake account, that's how little it affects everything else. All in all, a great game. 8/10",

It has a lot of challenges and pure genius moments that will make you smile when you complete them, very fun to play and easy to get into. My only complaint is the length of main story, but it does have challenge rooms that should keep you busy.",

Please EA, just die already.  That said, the game is pretty awesome. I had a hard time putting it down and played for 3 hours in the first sitting. Graphics are good and control is decent, at least with a controller. I love all the little sounds the alien makes. If you're a fan on minions, you'll love this little guy.",
