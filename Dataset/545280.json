            "review_text": "  So My friend Purchased me this game as a 'payment' for another title I provided him, And I came Into this game with possibly the lowest expections I could possibly have. I peeped some trailers and a few reviews and only saw bad to come from this title, But there was a face of hope in my future. This game starts you of in a dim train station?? Idk ♥♥♥♥♥ not hd so its kind of gay already, But you are prompted to hit f to use the 'flashlight' which is more like a low powered lantern more then a fleshlight, and this .... is when the real game begins baby. You make your way down a mile long tunnel dark as hell of course and when you get to the end the scenery switches up on ya boy and you are in space. Once you get to the 'space station' you find a locked door that is stopping you from continuing. So this is when the games small faults come into play, because one of the main delimas In the game is 'you need to find a key somewhere in this room to escape the underground' and the key you need to hunt down to open this first door is you must back track to the start and go up a stair case that actually wasn't even inserted into the game... But what they did insert for you was a path way to the bts of the map you can see the magical world of pixels in about 10p crystal clear HD. So you must use cleaver game mechanics by running on the outside of the map to the point where the door is and then it will trigger the next level. When you load into the level you are literally thrown into this space room and then thrown into a cave with random tools littered around the floor. Me being a well know speedrunner this open area pleased me, giving many ways to zoom. Once again you are forced to find another key, once you find the key you pick up another key and the cycle continues. But wait once you complete this room you are greated with the saving grace of The face of hope a corn maze. you run through the maze in no less then 20 secs its quite the experience to see its quite a feeling you can only truly feel once. Once you finish the maze you are gifted a Strap and some ammo and this is when the game flips you on your head instead of just running you now are running with a strap. You will enter a space room once again and encounter one of the 2 enemy types in the game the biodoods 2000 they hard. after this you basically are done with the game and you are greeted with a message 'to be contiuned' after you reach the end of the game in a open field. At this moment I found out the meaning of this game the true face of hope was me the whole time..  Tl:dr God tier game changed my life",

            "review_text": "So, about this game. It is more or less broken. It WILL crash from time to time, the sound will randomly cut out and will most of the time, if at all, be so loud that you will jump five feet in the air. The gunplay is bad beyond belief and will sometimes fire on its own for no reason. The graphics look like something taken right from the ps 1 era aswell. The level designe is odd and random. Did I mention one whole part of the map is missing so you have to fumble around in oblivion before finding the right way? Do not buy this game unless you are into bad 'horror' games.",
