            "review_text": "Simply Fantastic Indie Game Engine to play around with and learn to use which also has a good amount of excellent tools and graphics.   It has a lot going on for it which may seem a bit uneasy to look upon at first but there's plenty of starter tutorials to get you going in the right direction.   And as with anything there's a few obvious rough spots when running it that are bound to put some chinks in your armor when using it so as with anything it's not going to be 100% perfect mainly for being indie and a fairly new release.  An example of such would be the free version from the website I downloaded initially to try before I buy which did not start up. Also, I've noticed several warnings appear in the console though most were from the fps example. And the S2Engine is a bit heavy on my cpu compared to Unity and UE4 since every time I run it my fan goes absolutely beserk until I exit the engine.  Luckily though, the Debut dev has promised to fix it up as often as he can while adding in much needed improvements based on community feedback. So far he is also providing good forum support for potential problems or questions instead of ignoring them like other devs do which is a plus in my book.  So, other than those things above I've yet to experience any issues with this Steam Version of the S2Engine and it's going pretty well so far. I will be updating my review more in-depth once I'm further into development and understanding this engine a lot better.  Aside from all that I consider it a must-have for any aspiring indie developer and it's worth every penny especially for what it can do!",

            "review_text": "After waiting for this engine to be released for a couple years and using the open beta for awhile, then using it while it has been released on steam. I love it it's my alternative to UE. It also has great water physics and foliage capability's. Yes the engine has a couple of issues due to some people either experiencing crashing or FPS problems. I havent run into a issue yet but thats just me. This review may be a bit biased since I am a friend of the developer and I am a moderator on the forums. But overall I admit theres some bugs that need to be fixed and will be fixed, in its current state I dont recommend it to anyone who wants to jump right in a expect there to be tons of models and everything there for them already. I recommend this to anyone who is SERIOUS about game development and has good knowledge on how to use the visual coding system and how to make basic models. But if you want to get into game development I would suggest this over anything else as it has a learning curve and it makes you actually work towards some features that either UE or Unity would just handle for you or just give you the solution.",

            "review_text": "After long wait, B5 update is here and now I can speak only positive about this engine.   S2 is finally well optimized, and there is a couple of new features that is making your life easier if your hardware is not strong enough to chew next gen graphics from this engine. First and most important for me is Resolution Scale option. If your UI feels sloppy, frame rate is low during testing, use this feature and your headache will be gone in a second. If you don't know what is sucking memory in your game, there is an option to check that out as well which makes your debugging a lot easier and pleasant.  I have a feeling that S2 is now a LOT stable then in previous versions, crashes that I've complain about in previous version are now gone.  For $20 I really have to say that this is the best your money can get. Visuals are amazing in this engine, there is so much things to tweak to satisfy your taste and you are going to spend hours of experimenting with fx/post options and they are all looking great.   As a someone who just dive in into 3D game making I can't recommend this engine enough. Only I wish to see now are new official video tutorials, and some of them to be focused on scripting as well.   And to not forget developer support for the new users, he's super fast in solving your beginner (and advanced) problems!",
