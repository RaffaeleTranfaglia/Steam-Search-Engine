            "review_text": " Edit:  Thank you for listening to us DotEmu! This review has been revised due to post-release changes to alleviate some of my and others concerns.  It's fantastic to finally see the original Little Big Adventure on Steam! The 'Enhanced Edition' now available on Steam contains a port of the mobile version along with the original emulated in DosBox. I really recommend getting this version not due to the mobile port, but rather due to the original bundled herein.  If you have never heard of this games series before and do not intend on playing the mobile port there isn't much more to say; stop reading now and get this gem! You won't regret it.  The intended main attraction of this 'Enhanced Edition' is unmistakenly a port of the mobile version for Android/iOS and as of writing this retains the controls established for said port. Contrary to the original which is controlled by keyboard alone this Steam version can only be played using either mouse or a gamepad. While not being my preferred way of playing this game the mouse works mostly alright but detracts from the way I feel this game is meant to be experienced. Gamepad controls are severly underworked and bugged at this time, where control of the character is snapped at strange angles.  Showing evidence of misplaced priorities on part of the DotEmu team when porting this game from mobile to PC (read Steam), we can see that the main focus of this release has been a change of the aesthetics. I'm sorry to say but icons look like they've been made by a 12 year old trying out Photoshop for the first time and fails to retain the original feel of the game. The look of the menu have also been changed, having gone from the distinct LBA blue color we know and love to being gray and dull.  Now don't let the two paragraphs above get you down. This game is still fantastic and truely unique, it's a must for any gamer who may have missed it up until this point. Just don't play the 'Enhanced Edition' at this point in time and instead launch the original version.  It's also well worth noting that all DosBox releases of LBA have issue in common with mistimed audio tracks (music) and poor midi quality out of the box. Just make a search for how to fix this on the forum here on Steam or on GOG and you should be home free.",

An absolute gem of an adventure with a wonderful (and colorful) cast of characters (with some unique voice overs), a very good story plot, excellent music scores and once you master the game controls; this little gem will draw you into the world of Twinsun.   I would totally recommend this game if you are looking for an adventure game with a good story and is clean fun!",

            "review_text": "The game is good, but the redone controls are problematic. The controls are good for just moving the character around, but what they seemed to have missed ( probably didn't even play the game through) is that it is practically impossible to 'push' objects around (such as the numerous dungeons) to orient them properly or to move the object on a button that opens an adjacent door. When you click on the object you want to move, the character will try to move around that object instead of pushing it. When you click the character to move 'ahead' of the object, the character will still, go around the object you're trying to move. This quicly becomes irritating to the point of madness. At some point the object you're trying to move onto a button that opens a door simply gets stuck and I can't get passed this dungeon. This makes the game unplayable at the moment. Currently stuck at 'Temple of Bu 3rd scene.' The only way to beat it is to use arrow keys instead but you can't activate the arrow keys with the remastered version. The only other alternative is to connect a gamepad (which I don't have) to the computer and play it that way.   The game is great, and it works but the controls are a huge bummer. Please fix this issue. Again, this issue makes this game unplayable and unbeatable when you have to move objects.  ",

Im happy to have it immortalized in the STEAM store, and being able to play it once more.  I highly recomend this not just for the story but the great ambient music and the bloodless action filled story.",
