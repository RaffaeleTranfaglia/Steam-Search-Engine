Instead of ascending to a new plane of existence, you are now self-employed in the Afterlife with your own haunted house to run. Keep people just scared enough to keep believing in you, but not enough to alert the local authorities.",

Edit: after a bit back and forth, i have managed to work out the controls. and while they are VERY finicky at times, i could actually enjoy and play the game, and at this point it turns out to be very fun.  rate 5/10",

Wait a while for them to do something about the nonstop crashing, and buy it on sale to minimize Anita's cut.",
