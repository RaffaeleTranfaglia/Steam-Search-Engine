            "review_text": "This is an okay hidden object game with a mystical theme and a lot of light jump scares and things crawling across the screen, mostly fairly easy puzzles with a few more difficult ones with a fair variety to them, the hidden object scenes are heavily weighted to the morphing object type scenes, and some scanning for places in the scene you can zoom into or interact with, so mostly you are just clicking on anything that moves or changes the cursor, rather than actually really looking for objects in the list, which isn't my favourite way of doing HOGs to be honest.  The story is fine, if a bit formulaic - you know exactly what has happened from about two minutes in, who did it, so there isn't much in the way of story development through most of the game, it is all at the beginning and last couple of scenes. You play a detective investigating a missing boy, and this gives one of the good points of the game - your task list is very sensible, makes what you are doing logical and sensible, and things progress clearly as to what you are doing and why (as opposed to many HOGs where you just seem to randomly wander around finding items that you have no idea what you are going to do with, etc.), although with the proviso you seem completely unperturbed by the later tasks mostly are given to you by ghostly apparitions.  A weak point is the layout of rooms/places, there are only really two locations in the game and the second one I found very confusing to navigate (especially outside), mostly relying on the hint button to get me to the right place rather than trying to work out how to get there myself. Another issue is it all being set in Venice, but we never really see anything of the city, just the inside of two houses and the grounds of the second which seems a bit of a waste of a great setting.  Overall then a playable enough HOG with light horror elements, fairly short (probably a couple of hours if not repeatedly interrupted by cats), without any huge flaws but no great selling point either.",

            "review_text": "Let's start with the only redeeming quality this game possesses, in my opinion: in the beginning it has a decent atmosphere. That's it. Do yourself a favor do NOT get this game.  Dear developer a few items of feeedback:  1) waiting for items to appear, disappear or reappear seemingly at random should NOT be a core game mechanic.  2) If you're going to have me travel between areas constantly, because you want more rooms than meaningful content in your game, at least give me either a quick travel or make them connect in a logical manner.  3) If you release a game, make sure that you have checked the quality of the visuals of each location for consistency.  4) If you're going to have a game relient on clicking/tapping, make sure that your controls are not needlessly precise.  5) If you want a game to have a great UI and aesthetically pleasing HUD, fine, but don't have it block up parts of the screen with interactable content. 6) If you're going to be using imagery that is setting consistent don't randomly do things because they are cool. I just dragged myself through a waferthin plot that incorporated visual imagery of the Black Plague and disease; had a killer that literally stumbled on a plank and fell to his death because he was wearing an impractical mask (no I'm not kidding); musical instruments and music itself that has been imbued with necromancy; devil-worshipping serial killers; and last, but not least, unexplained and unfounded claims of immortality. Seriously, stick to one. And since I happen to know a few of Edgar Allen Poe's stories, if they WERE inspired by him, I hope you've been cleansing your house with sage, because I expect him to haunt you until the end of time. 7) Puzzles in hidden-object games can show ore variety than playing memory and sliding objects around. 8) 'Hidden' objects should not be hidden in plain sight, unless there is enough clutter around the screen for people to overlook them anyway. Using moving setpieces to obscure vision is NOT an enjoyable diversion, it's frustrating, too distracting and simply tedious as they even BLOCKED items I needed. 9) If you're going to want me to interact with my environment more, even during the 'hidden' object games do NOT place areas of interest without any form of indication in tiny little areas around the screen. They are easily missable and create the idea that the puzzles were rushed or simply lazily constructed. 10) If you want me to invest anything at all in the characters you create, either don't have them pop up only once (you know what? Don't even bother naming them, if you do) or have me find clues to their life outside their current predicament in the surroundings. 11) If you want me to feel like I'm doing haunted house-type magicky stuff don't give me 'puzzles' that focus on finding bottles or twelve keys or whatever, have me go through alchemical formulae, finding magic runes and combining elements of sorcery. 12) If you want to create a believable setting... ADHERE TO PHYSICS. The burner for the lacquer? That is NOT how that works. That bag that fell down, after being pulled off a branch DIRECTLY over water? That should NOT have landed two three meters away. 13) If I go around looking for a whole bunch of useless crap on a screen cluttered with junk, at least have the sense to have me look for items that HELP me. I do NOT understand how looking for gems or whatever is going to somehow result in me getting a scroll! This is NOT logic, this makes NO sense and completely and utterly ruins the experience. 14) If you want me to move pieces around a board or slide things around, give me the option of dragging them. Moving everything piece by piece, having to repeatedly select a target to move and a location to move to OVER AND OVER AND OVER... makes the game exceedingly tedious. 15) If you're going to have me focus on a murderer with a fetish for doctors and disease, who is then implied to be into devil-worship in a pursuit for immortality: don't make it a jackass that falls off a wooden plank, to then start a new 'plotline' about ghosts and a father trying to help his son. It makes no sense and is extremely unsatisfying. It wraps nothing up, I haven't accomplished anything and it makes the entire experience feel lazy, random, confusing and lackluster. And there's probably more, but I can't think of it right now and I feel like I've been exposed to this atrocity of a game for too long. It's a shame though, with an opening like that it had potential: the imagery was there, the insinuations of magic, the oppressive atmosphere.",

The puzzles were way too easy, the handling was awkward. The lip synchro was not even at an acceptable standard, and it tried so damn hard to be scary but all in all it was just a boring piece of wasted time. It took me little over 2 hours to finish, only because I took several breaks during playing ... I purchased it on sale and even that is too much in my opinion. Really disliked it.",

The voice overs are not great and they use real people as graphics rather than artwork (myself I hate when a game does this).   If you can nab this game for cheap like I did it might be worth a afternoon play through but it's nowhere near the full price.",
