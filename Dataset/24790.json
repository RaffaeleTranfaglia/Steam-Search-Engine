            "review_text": "Ignore my hours. I had this game on disk since it first came out, and honestly, its had more time put into it than any of my other strategy games put together.  When Westwood still existed the C&amp;C series always were wonderful to play - There was just that touch of polish and care which went into their games that you didn't quite get with others, even right down to the little animations of the commandos lighting a cigerrette and chucking it aside, quoting one of their infamous lines with a chuckle. So for 2D units you were commanding quite a colourful and unique army.  However when C&amp;C3 came along... Oohh boy, that jump into 3D. It brought fresh life to the series! ... too bad it was the last 'good' game beyond Red Alert 3 after that. EA had washed everything 'Westwood' down the drain.   As always the three factions are almost brilliantly balanced; They each have strengths and flaws which play a triangular role against one another, with similar but unique powers and tech trees. While they can be infamous for certain reasons - Scrin with their hordes of alien ships for example - there is no reason why a player cannot use either GDI or NOD to the same extent and counter it.   From the previous two games the missions are also once again varied, can last you a while, and the AI can be dubious when you're unprepared (if not a little clumsy here or there) which means you can get quite a few hours out of Skirmish mode.  -- Edit -- Unfortunately however these days the game's multiplayer has all but dissolved. I think there is still a small community and you might still be able to play matches, though its rare and you're going to have to go out and find it. Despite this I still enjoy playing the game and its Kanes Wrath expansion as a time waster and fond memory of the good times I had with it. --  Like I said. Sad to see its the last 'good' game of the series. Command &amp; Conquer 4 'Twilight' ruined the finale to the story by ripping out the core gameplay mechanics, making maps capture-the-flag esque and point control, while plummeting the player into a final 'thats all folks!' with the ending. If you want a true C&amp;C game, get Tiberum Dawn or Sun. If you want an enjoyable 3d C&amp;C game, get this, or Red Alert 3.",

Still ♥♥♥♥ you EA For the ♥♥♥♥ sexual and ending to the Tiberium franchise that we all know and hate, except for that one kid in this current generation that says 'Better then the previous titles, probably more better than Generals' If you ever encounter that kid, punch him in the nuts and say, ♥♥♥♥ you. I enjoyed the game, bought it 5 times with dlc for friends cause there is a way to revive the multiplayer use a site called Revora C&amp;C and download the online multiplayer hooking tool thing that launches with your game, after you click the play button on steam press the game you selected and play, you will require an account from their site. And there is a tool called Gentool which I think Should revive multiplayer for generals.",

            "review_text": "Command and Conquer is a legendary franchise that is much beloved by people all over the world. A franchise that unfortunately has remained dormant for some time and most likely will continue to do so. But most of the games contained within it are extremely great, and this one is no exception.  C&amp;C 3 takes place in the Tiberium Wars arc that began with the original game. The world has prospered under the control of the GDI. A sort of United Nations military force, that combats terror threats. However, a quasi-religious cult known as the Brotherhood of Nod reappears to try and take control by force. The thing I like the most about Command and Conquer is it feels the closest to present day warfare compared to other RTS games such as Starcraft. It features a very well funded military symbolizing 'peace' and 'order' against an anarchistic anti authoritarian movement. And the entire conflict revolves around the accumulation of a resource known as Tiberium.  This also ties into the general gameplay of the series and this game in particular. In Command and Conquer there aren't any worker units and buildings are queued similar to units. Your units tend to be squads of footsoldiers, tanks, jet fighters and so forth. Even though it is a very sci-fi game with aliens, lazer beams and so forth. It still feels much more down to earth. Infantry units die very quickly to units carrying rifles, but are useless against buildings and vehicles. Wheras vehicles have lots of health and can carry other units but are weak against explosives. It's a game where you have to pay very close attention to what units you're controlling and which ones are attacking which.   C&amp;C 3 in particular takes a few cues from other RTS games like Starcraft. It adds an alien race known as the 'Scrin'. Who have their own unlockable campaign. Although there are very few surprises when playing as the Scrin, they queue their units the same and their buildings are mostly similar. But there are statistical differences to playing it. Which unfortunately only become really prominent at higher levels of play.   My favorite aspect of C&amp;C 3 in particular is it's skirmish mode. Specifically how customizeable it is. You can set a particular AI opponent to have different mannerisms. Like you can set an AI opponent to turtle, meaning staying in his base and preferring to not attack. Or you can set an AI opponent to be a rusher, who will attack at the soonest moment. It's one of my favorite RTS games to play exclusively in singleplayer for this reason. Multiplayer is also available however you will need to use third party methods to get connected as it ran on Gamespy which has been shut down.  Solid RTS, one of my favorites. Easily recommended if you're a fan of campaign and skirmish.",

My friend and many times were cut by the grid. The coolest race I think that GSB and Screenshots. At GSB steep tanks well and normal planes. Normal Nodes have the aircraft 'invisible' tanks and bad infantry is not very much. The Screens are great planes and tanks, but with infantry bad. In General this game does not come off.

There was no need to build anything else and as a result the game became very simplistic and predictable.  The AI in CNC3 was also a step backwards from Generals. It didn't attack with mixed units most of the time, and it rarely defended it's base at all. When it did it often used just one type of defense, which of course makes for an easy attack.  Out of frustration, a friend and I worked on a mod with the help of the rest of the TALON Clan. The TALON Mod made a lot of changes to the game that made it much more balanced, fun, challenging and enjoyable to play. Look for it on ModDB.",

My rig at the time was slightly crippled by the awesome battles, but now, armed with a somewhat high spec machine and a Dell U2711, I was worried the 1440p resolution wouldn't work. So glad I was wrong! This game looks just as good, if not better, than it did when it first came out and I have found myself falling in love with it all over again. Haven't tried multiplayer as I always sucked at it. But the campaign is great and the skirmish is fun. The battles are entertaining and the intensity, colour and light will make you want to wear sunglasses its so awesome! Now just need to get Kane's Wrath and continue to bathe in the nostalgia. GET THIS GAME!",

            "review_text": "Decent game. My only complaints are:  EA completeley changed the atmosphere of the game. It went from post-apocalyptic, dramatic and gloomy with some heavy science-fiction elements, to Modern Warfare as an RTS game with aliens. They completely got rid of a lot of aspects that made Tiberian Sun such an atmospheric game, such as map-wide ion storms, tiberium mutants (while they still exist canonically they only rarely make appearances), and NOD was dumbed down greatly in the sense that their technology now sucks pretty badly and their numbers/strength are fairly laughable.    You can't have a singleplayer skirmish without the AI spamming grenadiers/black hand/buzzers. Those are the only infantry units that the game's AI will make and it makes it extremely frustrating to employ infantry of your own because those three types of troops clear garrisons and kill infantry instantly.  The scrin are OP - it's mostly a matter of how you fight them but considering they get fighters that don't need to re-arm and gunships and frigates and all that and the NOD and GDI only have fighters and some light AA, it's not really fun to go up against them unless you know exactly what you're doing. -Another thing about the Scrin is that all or most of their units get shields. It's like playing against the protoss in Starcraft all over again.  Another thing is that defenses suck (unless you play with the old Tiberium Essence mod) - there's no walls and turrets are pretty weak.   All in all I'd give it a 7/10 because I loved the previous C&amp;C games and EA did a good job of continuing the story for the Tiberium series, but it is lacking in some areas that could have been executed better.",

If you play as the GDI, you should focus on vehicle divisions, Nod focuses on infantry and stealth tactics as seen with their damned stealth tanks...and the Scrin...well...for your sake, I hope you have AA defenses...or you are doomed before you start...",
