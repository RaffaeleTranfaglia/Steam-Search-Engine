I can see where the mixed reviews have come from because the game does drop you in with no explanation as what you're doing or how things work, but the puzzles are some of the most innovative mind benders I have experienced. This game teaches you not to trust your senses. Don't trust your instincts. Look away and things change. This game teaches you that forgetting what was behind and what is ahead is the path to enlightenment. If you want puzzles that will have you kicking yourself for not seeing the answer for half an hour when it was right in front of your face, this is one game that gives you that. The graphics are beautiful, the story is confusing, and I walked away from the game with a lot of questions, but also an experience that stuck in my head for the next couple of days.",

It's an interesting time, they don't hold your hand, and the experience is, in the end, what you make of it.  Not everyone's cup of tea, but it's beautiful and interesting and worth at least a look.",

Despite this, I didn't like Rememoried. I played through 2 or 3 levels and it felt more like I was playing a tech demonstration than a game. I didn't understand my character hitbox and how I was going to interact with the geometry in the game. I found it difficult to -jump- on things.   Maybe it was the first person view that tripped me up, but even without that, I didn't feel like I had any idea why I was doing things or going places. I felt punished by 'failure' which sometimes was just because I was testing the edge of the level, which then would restart, all voice acting included.   I was excited about this game, but after getting stuck not being able to jump to a platform and having everything else set me back a level, I couldn't keep going.",

The first time it happened was a face that I only got a glance of, so the mind filled in the blanks with disturbing versions. Yet, that is very particular.  To call this a puzzle game is a far fetch after you figured out that (spoiler?) the stage alters itself when your camera angle is not pointed at it. Other times are finding where to go with some kind of a e s t h e t i c effect on screen, e.g. calidoscope view, lense glare. I suppose thats where the 'exploration' tag comes from.  Its definitely a platformer.",

            "review_text": "This game comes across as an art piece, but it is not meant to be fun. The game is frustrating and confusing at times in ways which go against conventional game design. The main mechanic is that things change when you are not looking, but it seems random as to whether you'll get something useful or not.  On one particular puzzle with a windmill, the mechanic got worse though... jumping between platforms and turning around to make new ones appear would sometimes make the one you were already standing on disappear and drop you. The amount of jumping that it would require to do it without this was already significant, so this just added to the frustration.  The fact that the game doesn't 'end' made things all the worse, as it just loops you back to the start after completing 20-something levels with no indication that you've actually finished...  I got this for 90% off and even then i feel this isn't worth the time.",
