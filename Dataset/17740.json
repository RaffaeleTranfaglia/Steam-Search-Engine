I still want to play it, but it appears to me that people are leaving this game for 'dead.' Yeah, alot of the servers are virtually no-existant, and it's difficult, but that's only because people let it die! Honestly the creators might be busy with something else. This is a Source mod after all. Hell, I'm suprised this mod's still standing after all these years.   I suggest it because it blends RTS with FPS, which makes it way more interesting, mainly because the players are humans and not some drone who will blindly follow orders at the click of a mouse. Yeah, it's frustrating when you have difficulty in ordering people around, but there's always room for improvement. Even IF this game dies, I just hope some coder figures out how to add bots into the game.",

It's not some shoot-em-up where everyone only works for kills, early in the game most of the team is doing support roles.  An engineer can bring a skill to bring allies back from the dead, but still has his submachine gun, seismic grenades to destroy buildings, can construct buildings placed by the commander, placing his own turret, and a radar or camera, and dropping an ammo box. All of these can be done by a single player.  Meanwhile, a grenadier carries a mortar against buildings, a rocket launcher against vehicles, landmines, a handgun, the ability to detect mines, and can choose skills such as detecting the armor of enemy tanks, defusing mines, extra armor while driving, and many more.",

So I said, and I quote '♥♥♥♥ yar bloody traps ya stupid lil buggers' And I got banned from that server for 'Abusiveness'. You need to have single player with bots to level up to. You also need to make F11 not to close the game. Game cycles are VERY LONG, and there are not a lot of people who play the game. Sadly this game is a NONO! Great idea, dumb gameplay and mechanics.  GO PLAY BATTLEFIELD 1942 Instead. Looks better, runs better, and is better.",

Unfortunately, nobody else did.  I was a member, back in the old Empires back when it wasn't on Steam of | RAGE |. We won a game or two against the other then-main clan, Epic.

You must change which sides of your tank are facing the enemy to prolong your vehicles life.  A weaker tank can beat a higher class tank with good driving and tech but you are unlikely to beat a tier three with a tier one.  There is an economy and tech to worry about and while your comm can restrict spending on resources on tanks you can bypass his limitations by doing good and saving enough to buy your own.  Finally this simulates the military blunders by giving you a terrible commander or even giving you a team that pulls all arty tanks and getting floored by regular tanks that close in and kill them.  Oh, and you will want to be an engineer pretty much every time you play.",

Infact, I have 27 or so hours on my record at the time of writing this, and I've already gotten the hang of vehcile and infantry combat. The accuracy system can be very rewarding, and the damage system is unforgiving, yet satisfying. Yes, it's a very old HL2 Mod, but by god, It has potential. Think of it as a free, kinda rough planetside 2, give or take a few elements. I recommend it if you want to learn how to be a serous and good part of a team, and enjoy a hard, unforgiving yet rewarding FPS.",
