    "description": "Deep in the twilight of the Black Forest, you and your companions crouch before the robber-knight's tower. Hans, the alchemist, places his mysterious potion by the door. Ebhard the friar implores Saint Dunstan to bless your weapons and armor. And you and Gretchen grip naked long swords, praying your plate mail won't squeak.",

            "review_text": "Darklands is one of the most unique, deep and innovative RPGs of all time. One of the first games to feature an open world, it is also notable for its setting - a mostly accurate depiction of the 15th c. Holy Roman Empire. I say mostly, because within this game, creatures of medieval myth and Germanic folklore are depicted as being real, so the woods are full of monsters, witches pose a grave threat, and dragons (who are, of course, servants of Satan) ravage the land from time to time, requiring that a band of brave heroes lock them back up to await the Second Coming, or, more likely, die in the attempt. For the most part, though, gameplay involves travelling across the world, fighting monsters, bandits and robber barons while doing the odd job for a village schulz or Medici banker.  Gameplay consists of three distinct components - travelling across the world on the overworld map, choose-your-own-adventure style events within towns and dungeons, and combat encounters/dungeons that take place on a smaller scale tactical map. The dungeons can be a pain to navigate at first, as the characters move painfully slowly and the pathfinding is about as good as you'd expect for a game from 1992.  The game mechanics are quite complex and involved, and though they might seem a bit impenetrable at first glance, everything feels quite good once you understand how it works. As suits the setting, the player characters (as decent servants of Christ) have no access to traditional RPG magic - instead, your supernatural abilities involve dabbling in alchemy to produce potions with spectacular effects and praying to Catholic Saints for intervention. Improving these abilities involves tracking down new formulae and getting lessons in hagiography at the local cloister, respectively. These are quite easily the game's most obtuse mechanics, and I'd say that there's no shame in looking up a guide for information on which of the game's seemingly endless number of saints do what exactly, and what the stat requirements are to call upon their aid, or how alchemy even works in the first place.  Like any good RPG, as well, this game offers plenty of opportunities for roleplaying, as well as the ability to make choices, moral and otherwise. However, the right answer most often isn't what's the most sensible to you, the player, but what would be most sensible to a medieval German Catholic. As a consequence, you can really get into the Deus Vult mindset in this game, slaughtering whole villages for disrespecting the mass and playing toady to the Church hierarchy. There is a storyline to complete as well, involving Satan, the Knights Templar, the Wild Hunt and the witches' black Sabbath, though that's something that's likely to emerge only after you've proceeded rather far along in the sandbox.  If you're the sort of person that can enjoy hardcore, old-school RPGs, I would recommend this game with every fibre of my being.",

            "review_text": "An RPG from Microprose that, to my knowledge, was the only RPG Micropose ever released. And you know what? It may not have aged well, as in at all, but oh, how it puts some games to shame! Basically, one of the earliest examples, if not *the* earliest example, of an open-ended Role-Playing Game, you have everything you could want just about in this one package!   Character creation: Whoo, boy! This game has a very complex, but very fun and interesting, character creation system. While you only have so much to choose from for your character's sprite, the real fun comes from choosing which skills you want each party member to have. For example, want to have a well-balanced party like the game manual suggests? Go right ahead. Want a party full of big strong warriors who are dumb as a bucket of rocks but can wear all armor and wield heavy weapons without breaking a sweat? You can do that. Maybe you want to have just one character to be an alchemist and have the rest be what would be considered in many modern RPGs as a 'paladin,' nothing is going to stop you. Now, having said that, there is no 'traditional class' system, it all depends on your characters attributes and skills, and you can alter them (within reason) to your liking. There is no 'true' right-or-wrong party here.  Open-ended Sandbox: When this game, and anyone else who's played it says 'Wide open-ended sandbox gameplay', they aren't kidding. To give you some small idea, your whole party always meets at the inn of some random city in the game, and their main goal in life is to bring honor and glory to their names, and to avoid evil and do good. After you've spent some time in your party's starting city killing bandits and building up their reputation and skills, you're ready to head out into the wide-open world... of Midieval Germany (which isn't really a world, it's just a country) and pick any random direction and begin travelling, fighting bandits, raubritters (robber knights) and witches and devils left, right, and center, with hardly any story, and you have this game pretty much. Trust me on this, though; it's much more fun than it sounds.  Music: For music, there's not that much, but for what there IS, you can almost immediately tell by how the music sounds in a particular situation what is about to happen. For example, if you're near a dragon's lair, the music becomes creepy, ominous. In towns, the music gives off a sense of peace. If you get attacked by bandits, the music sounds like something's about to jump out and attack you which, more often than not, will.  I don't know if there's too much else to say about the game, other than it mixes RPG elements with Choose-Your-Own-Adventure books, and with the beautiful hand-drawn artwork, could you blame them? Now, yes, the game DOES have it's shortcomings, like being slow, and the game sometimes being rigged against the player, and the copy-protection kicking you out of the game if you should choose the wrong answer, but other than that, it's a game that if you really needed something to do, then I honestly can't recommend it enough. But if you're coming to this game looking for character-development and a good story, as much as I'm ashamed to say, you won't find it here.  I'll leave with this: Darklands was, basically, the Midieval German Elder Scrolls version of Ultima III: Exodus. If you like either of those games, then I feel certain that you'll like this one, as well  ",

            "review_text": "I was obsessed with this game back in college and spent hours playing. This game along with Arcanum is the game by which I judge all other RPGs which probably isn't entirely fair. Darklands has an expansive world and is probably the most open ended game I've ever played. The character creation is one of the best I've encountered. I cannot recommend this game highly enough and I'm so happy to have it in my possession again. I wish that this game would get a much needed remake that would do it the justice it deserves. I don't know if that's even possible, but it would be something I'd love to see.",

            "review_text": " A masterpiece by MicroProse   This game is right up there, in quality and complexity, with MicroProse's other legendary titles, such as X-COM: UFO Defense and Master of Magic/Orion. Darklands is the result of such geniuses trying their hand at an RPG.  Features:  A massive open world, in medieval Germany, with historically accurate towns, names, geography, economy, and so on. Everything is simulated in an extremely complex way, the world is very alive. The game was so complex, it actually required 5000 hours of testing, and even after that several patches were needed. The version on Steam is the latest and best one, of course.  The game comes with a 100 page manual, edited with painstaking detail, to get the player into a medieval German mood, and teach a thing or two about history. And another 100 page Clue Book, which explains the highly complex mechanics of the game, besides adding even more to the mood.  Very interesting classless, XPless character system. Creating a good party is by far the most complex and fun activity, compared to other RPGs (yes, even Wizardry). The characters are alive and the game always has something in the bag, to make them feel even more so and provide them with fun ways, to show off their strengths and weaknesses.  A subtle and mysterious story, which requires the party to pay attention to small details, investigate, intrigue and fight their way through. Completing the game requires around 100 hours, but the player is allowed to take their time and progress at their own pace, so it can offer way more than that. New players will probably restart several times, once they're more familiar with the very unorthodox RPG system and world of the game, to create a more capable party of adventurers.   Darklands is not an easy game to get into, due to its complexity, but dedicated RPG players, especially historically inclined ones, will find a true gem, and a fun adventure, which can be replayed every few years.",
