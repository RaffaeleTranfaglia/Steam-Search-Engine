I've been playing the episodes as they've been released on iOS, and it's amazing to see how much work has been done to bring the app to Windows/Mac. It feels like an entirely brand new game, in the most awesome way possible.  I really appreciate games that are not afraid to try new things, and Republique nails it. It's not without flaws, but it's still an enjoyable experience.  Very much looking forward to the next episode!",

Eight hours of gameplay that is more annoying than challenging and then... Nothing. Completely pointless.  I will however give the team cred for artistic and technical achievements, considering how this game has to perform on mobile. The art and sound is great considering the target platform. The voice acting can be quite cringey at times. What annoyed me the most was probably the sub-par motion capture acting. A lot of time the body language reflected that of a comedic sketch rather than the tone of the scene and the game.  If you don't have other games to play at the moment, I guess go ahead. Otherwise just save your money and move on to something else.",

I died in the Metal Gear Solid tutorial... you know, the bit where it's you, a corridor, and a blind and deaf guard, and you basically get told 'push right to win'.  I lost.  I died in the CoD 4 tutorial. The unloseable mission.  I lost.  I quit Resident Evil and Silent Hill after 10 minutes, because they scared me too much.  I lost.  I... found myself drawn in to Republique.  The dystopian, futuristic, mysterious society. The simple, yet complex movement system. The lore, hidden in cassettes, newspapers, posters, and floppy disks.  The storyline. The characters. The secrets. The puzzles.  Yes, I'm scared. Yes, I'm bad at it, and despite what other people are saying, I am finding it very, very difficult. But I'm not giving up. I'm not putting it down, because I just completed chapter 1, and boy did it just get good.  I won.  Get. This. Game.  You won't regret it.",

            "review_text": "I've thoroughly enjoyed the game so far.  The premise is intriguing - as a disembodied entity on the other end of a phone call, you must guide  Hope  390-H through Metamorphosis, a surveillance dystopia that would give George Orwell nightmares. You have the power to hop between cameras, lock and unlock doors and even create distractions later on, while guiding your charge through the hours before 'The Arrival.'  The biggest pro for me is that you can't help but care for the fate of your charge. You observe, you can provide indirect assistance, and you can guide, but you have very little power to intervene. You have to be cautious with Hope - while she does have some capacity to defend herself the supplies she needs to do it are finite. I found myself caring about Hope very easily; she  is  relying on me after all. In that sense,  Republique  reminded me of  ICO  - another game where you find yourself really caring about the person you're escorting. I actually got angry at the start of Episode 3 when I saw that Hope had a black eye from one of the other characters, and I found myself tearing up with her at the end of the same episode. If your game gets me to empathise with a character to the point where I'm crying with them, you've done well.  The world you find yourself in is interesting too - I liked listening to the reasons why the Overseer/Headmaster wanted a particular book banned (you can collect them through the game) and the little details and stories you got about everyone and the world they're in really helped flesh things out for me.  My only complaint is that stamping 'Kickstarter Backer' on the info sheets of half the guards in the game broke the immersion for me. I think that could've been done better. Fortunately these breaks were short and the game pulled me back in pretty quickly. Aside from that, I enjoyed and recommend this game, and I hope the release of the final two episodes will continue to provide the quality gameplay and story I've come to expect so far.",

The last two episodes wasn't as good as the first three, but this Orwellian title has probably the best commentary about mass surveillance and cencorship, and the parallels between it and Ray Bradbury's classic novel Fahrenheit 451 is hard to miss. Innovative gameplay, a great and complex villain, and some fantastic voice acting makes Republique worth your money and your time!",
