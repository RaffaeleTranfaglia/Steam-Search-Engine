When I first heard about The Interactive Adventures of Dog Mendonça &amp; Pizzaboy, its crowdfunding campaign was already two thirds over and looking like it would have trouble reaching its target. Knowing that it would help OKAM Studio further development of the  F/OSS Godot Engine , I hopped onboard, figuring that the game itself would be a bonus and a nice diversion if/when it was released.  Looking back, I find myself doubly glad that I supported this project in spite of the bittersweet ending the journey has had.   In the 'making of' segment included at the end of the first graphic novel is a mention that The Secret of Monkey Island and Day of the Tentacle provided Dog Mendonça &amp; Pizzaboy creator Filipe Melo with inspiration for some of the humour seen in the graphic novels. These influences are also present within the game on multiple levels, ranging from superficial similarities to Curse of Monkey Island's cartoon aesthetic to more deeper approaches to puzzle design and pacing that feel in line with sensibilities found in early LucasArts adventures.  The game opens with Eurico (Pizzaboy) and Dog tied up, hanging above a vat of boiling wax during the final act of the adventure, giving some context for the relationship between the two core character while also setting the tone and stakes before skipping backward in time to allow players to control the events that lead up to that predicament.  A fishy new case leads Dog to be captured and Eurico is left to investigate both Dog Mendonça's disappearance and the case on his own with the dubious assistance of Dog's associate Pazuul, a demon trapped in a young girl's body, and the head of a gargoyle named Edgar.   Structurally, The Interactive Adventures of Dog Mendonça &amp; Pizzaboy provides narrative linearity by gating non-linear puzzle chains. Early on in the game, Eurico is tasked with performing a particular rite that requires a certain set of ingredients and tools that the player is free to acquire in any order, but are all required for the story to progress further. As is common with adventure games, the broad strokes of the plot are provided by high level objectives, but the moment-to-moment storytelling emerges in response to the player's actions and attitudes expressed through their dialogue choices and approaches to problem solving.  I found myself enjoying the game's pacing and approaches towards unveiling mystery. Dog Mendonça &amp; Pizzaboy manages to maintain the air of being a fun romp, while making sure that the player's awareness of the overarching plot just beyond reach in a way that keeps things compelling. Though it isn't a long game by the genre's standards (my first playthrough took around 6 hours and I was taking my time), it feels like it comes in at a good length for the story it's telling.  The presentation of the occult world rarely feels gratuitous or pantomime, but I can't help but feel that the game could have benefited from exploring the boundaries between it and the human world a little more. I felt like I was relying more on familiarity with these core concepts of the franchise's universe gained from the novels than from what was exposed within the game itself. I feel that it might be easy for newcomers to assume that the world of Dog Mendonça &amp; Pizzaboy doesn't also encompass the normal everyday human world we know from our own lives. I'm not certain that this would necessarily detract from the game, but to me, it feels like a core aspect of the franchise that gives some extra context to the events of the game.  Another aspect that I suspect may be a little jarring for some players is the quality of the English localisation. I feel uncomfortable judging the game on this without experiencing the Spanish or Portuguese versions (one of which I assume is the language that the game's dialogue was originally written in), but I don't speak either of those languages well enough to be able to play the game. The translation of the graphic novels feels stronger, but it's possible that it stands just out more in the game where actors are performing lines that don't quite feel natural. I am definitely be curious to hear how the German localisation (the only other language with recorded voice) compares.  There are a number of interface conveniences that tend to be common which I fond myself missing when playing and re-playing the game. While dialogue lines can be skipped with Space, there is no way to skip cutscenes. There's no double click fast-travel option, which I generally avoid making use of but still find the absence of super irritating.  So far as I've been able to discover, there are no options for configuring the game's resolution, and the game window is not resizeable when set to windowed mode - this may be an important issue for low-res laptop screens. The game also mutes on loss of focus, which caused me to miss sections of voiced dialogue when writing down notes.   In a move that goes beyond classic point and click adventure gameplay, the Dog Mendonça &amp; Pizzaboy game includes a number of timing oriented fight sequences. While these sorts of arcade-ish elements are certainly not unheard of in the genre and can be used to effectively control tension and provide a counterpoint to core gameplay (fists path combat in Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis springs to mind as a good example), the few point and click adventures which have experimented with them have tended toward making them optional (such as ship-to-ship combat in The Curse of Monkey Island).  Dog Mendonça &amp; Pizzaboy's fight sequences are fairly forgiving and can't imagine them making the game less accessible to very many players. They do provide some nice shifts in tone, but mechanically, they feel a little flat. Unlike the tactical gunplay of Gemini Rue where some slight enemy variations gives opportunity for multiple strategies to feel viable, or Quest for Glory's combat where player stats play a role in effectiveness, mastering Eurico's fighting abilities consists of recognising when to dodge and to immediately follow with a hit.   Though the influences that both the game and graphic novel incarnations of Dog Mendonça &amp; Pizzaboy draw upon are fairly obvious to anybody who has awareness and cares to look, the franchise still manages to carry a solid and endearing identity of its own. To me, The Interactive Adventures of Dog Mendonça &amp; Pizzaboy feels like a respectful homage to 80s and 80s cinema and adventure games. Beyond the celebration of culture that resonates with me, there is an engaging world filled with interesting characters that I can't help but want to spend more time with.

            "review_text": "After much thought I have to go against recommending this new entry into the 'point and click' game library. While it's worth playing I would only play it if I had nothing else in the 'adventure game' category to play. It is actually the reason why I bought it and played it.  The game has a lot going for it but it lacks a few things which bring it down the rungs against newer indie point and clicks and the classics from the old Sierra/Lucas arts days.  Its easy to see that this game wasn't originally meant to be in English as some of the phrasing and speech acting doesn't flow so well or has the wrong intonation for the particular phrase. It feels like most of the actors just read lines for sound samples. That isn't a dealbreaker however but just something to keep in mind, there are other adventure games that may not look so pretty but the voice acting is better. I have a feeling it might be to do with the translation and the odd dialogue progression sometimes, ala LA Noire, that the whole thing feels a bit confused and rushed. It makes sense it just doesn't flow quite right.  The artwork is perhaps one of the best features about this game, bringing back the old hand drawn feel of some of the later adventure games such as the original Broken Sword but in such rich detail and clarity. The problem is there is a bit too much of it with no ability to interact with anything even if it's only just for humorous intent. Some of the detail just doesn't make sense for where it is and just gives a feeling of cluttering the scene. Also some wonderful scenes are only just briefly shown when they could've made up another scene for puzzles and info, it feels a bit of a waste.  The animation is great in some areas of the game but oddly sparse in others, there's also the feeling of being a little lazy in some of the animation with certain things moving slightly just for the sake of moving when they could either be still or be a bit more animated such as people swaying. This gives the feeling of there trying to be more 'action' than there really is.  One of the great things of this game is the easter eggs and details relating other classic movies and adventure games, the bad thing is in some scenes there is a bit too much of it and not enough original content creating a bit of a feeling of riding on the legacy of older games and movies.  It is very short, it really feels like half or even a quarter of a game due to the plot being crammed into the scenario. There are a lot of really fresh things in the game in terms of plot, dialogue and humor, some great injections of fresh thinking even if sometimes it doesn't work e.g. The 'Jacket inventory' which is a great idea but unfortunately blocks some things if you're not far enough to the right.  It's worth giving it a go but if you're a fan of adventure games perhaps when it's on special.",
