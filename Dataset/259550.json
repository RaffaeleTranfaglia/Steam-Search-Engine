            "review_text": "I just finished Hero of the Kingdom (2.5 hours, give or take). It's a very unique game. Basically you're presented a top-down isometric screen that looks a little bit like Age of Empires 2 or HoMM3 or something. You click through text prompts on the screen in a sort of combination text adventure and hidden object game. You become a hero of your kingdom by moving through screens and helping people out. Maybe someone lost their son, so you hidden object find him. Nothing is difficult, it'll just be like you see a patch of mushrooms, and you click it so you get mushrooms added to your inventory. Or you are on your boat and click a barrel underwater to salvage it. So not really hidden object, more like click-to-acquire. Maybe a farmer needs someone to go to town to sell his flour, so you get flour, click to switch screens to the town, and sell the flour to a merchant. Your inventory has dozens of different types of commodities that you manage, flowers, eggs, swords, handymen, antlers, pearls, etc. Across the world various merchants buy and sell various commodities. There's no actual difficulty in that it seems like it's impossible to make a bad transaction. If you just keep buying and selling stuff and foraging and fishing and hunting you'll eventually get enough of what you need or enough money to buy what you need. I really can't compare it to any other game I've ever played. I had a fun time playing through it. I guess I wasn't really playing. Just kind of clicking everywhere.  I also laughed every time I'd go into some big climactic battle and my guy would be like 'We scored a crushing victory over the Dark Goblins. Oh and all of my soldiers died. We will miss them.' and then -10 soldiers in my inventory. Hahaha. Made them feel very disposable.  One flaw: The game autosaves and when you beat the game it erases your saves, meaning that if you want to get all the achievements you should do so BEFORE fighting the last boss (the last boss is clearly marked and identified).",

I can't find anything bad about it, it's very rewarding for the loot you can find and achievemens are not too hard to get, even if i finished the game before getting them all - but i really do not mind it.

            "review_text": "Quaint like an elderly lady's bungalow filled with many past adventures and expeditions, the attractively detailed land in  Hero of the Kingdom  possesses the old-fashioned quest-orientated method of play that I have yearned for through many wishful Steam purchases but had yet to truly discover until now.   Hero of the Kingdom  ranks highly in my gaming library as one of the most satisfyingly rewarding games I have played on Steam to date. It is most certainly one of the top 3 which I eagerly gave myself an auspicious pat on the back for buying. At $1.49 (75% off) it is money well spent. Completion only took me two days totalling 8 hours or so (didn't bother to quit game when taking dog for a walk). The game play is therapeutic and healing as even with a generic storyline, the long but seldom arduous line of quests are gratifyingly addictive.  If you enjoy RPGs as I do and rarely skip side quests as it is half the fun , then I highly recommend this title.   The controls are as easy as can be and I can't honestly admit this is a strategy game as it does not give the player a chance at failure as you will see if you play it. It isn't a game to test your gaming skills but a chance to relax from more demanding games. Out of games you can use to relax and enjoy like you used to enjoy games as a child, it never feels like a waste of time or is uncomfortable to play in terms of time or effort of lack thereof.    Hero of the Kingdom is my idea of a perfect holiday.",

As you go, there are a ton of simple tasks to perform (find this, build that, etc.) for the various people you meet along the way. You have to keep up with your supplies, your energy, and your list of all the tasks. While the approach is very relaxed, there is some strategy involved so you have to stay alert and not waste the resources you have on a task that won't push the game forward. Somewhat like a TM game, but involves resources.  The mechanics are flawless, and the artwork is great.  It is a simple and clever game that moves a bit slowly for me, but I think it's worth a look. Might be just what you're looking for.   So I recommend giving the demo a go, at least.",

The story is nothing special: your home is destroyed, your father is missing, and you must track him down. Your adventure quickly becomes larger in scale, and the eventual revelations are interesting, fitting, and satisfying. The gameplay is quickly accessible, but it takes a good deal of planning and resource management to get the tools, soldiers, medicines, and weapons you'll need to overcome your many foes. There are a variety of secrets to find in the environments, so that each new map is a treasure hunt for necessary materials and wildlife.   Hero of the Kingdom is a brief game and can be completed at around 5 hours. Achievements come regularly and keep you motivated. While the art style is simple, I found it charming and appropriate for this sort of adventure. I easily recommend this game for my friends who enjoy games which are a little different yet delightful.",

            "review_text": "I'm a cynical sort when it comes to games. There are so many of them on Steam, and with debacles like NMS, it's easy to become a bit jaded. I typically avoid most hidden object games to boot, so when I fired up Hero of the Kingdom I expected something pretty boring and tedious. I'm happy to say that I was wrong - and what I found recaptured some old memories for me.  Remember when you were a kid, discovering games for the first time, and letting your imagination whisk you away? I'm nearly thirty now, and that feeling is too rare these days. Hero of the Kingdom didn't blow me away, but it did help me remember that sometimes games can be like a cosy blanket that you settle into at the end of the day. A hot mug of tea and a crackling fire in winter - that's what this game is. The simple, rustic fantasy setting and verdant aesthetic, the gentle score and straightforward-yet-rewarding gameplay all combine very well to create a surprisingly immersive experience. The whole is much greater than the sum, I feel.  You start out with a pretty typical fantasy trope via your farm being burned to ashes by bandits, and your father going missing. From there, you embark on an adventure to capture all the krayfish and mercilessly steal eggs from nests. I mean, erm, 'helping fellow villagers'. These tasks range in importance...some are incredibly menial, some revolve around the livelihood of an NPC, and others up the stakes towards the prevention of an apocalypse. It's all quite homely, although the game doesn't shy away from generic soldiers getting killed. Essentially, the gameplay revolves around resource management in a point &amp; click environment - collect materials, trade them, sell them for cash, and so forth. You're fairly well railroaded at first, although at around the halfway point you can elect to ditch the sidequests in favour of just buying everything, if you're happy to buy/sell accordingly and get an endless profit going.  I was sceptical, but Hero of the Kingdom won me over from the outset. I beat the game in six hours, and I was thoroughly impressed. Well worth the cash when it's on sale, if only for being able to indulge your inner child for a few hours. I didn't even find all the collectables, but I don't mind that - it just gives me an excuse to come back and play it all again in a few months time...",

Good game for easy achievments, bad game if you pay more than 2 bucks.   Hero of the Kingdom is a point and click adventure mixed with a resource manager. You travel through different overview screens, visiting villages, mountains, forests and so on. On your way, you pick up items either by clicking (said 'Search those 5 pixels'-moments) or by buying/trading/questing at NPCs. The more you progress, the more resources you have. For example you need Energy to fight (a boar or wolf costs X energy), which you replenish by sleeping. You can sleep when you pay gold at inns or in the wild, if you have enough food on you (different camping sites ask for different kinds of food). You can also carry items, which hold longer (Weapons and tools, though they might break sometimes) Sadly, the system is kinda broken after a while for those, who notice how to milk endless gold out of the resource cycle. Maybe a patch would help here?  The artwork is pretty good, I expect the designer to give us a full course of his abilities in the future. Everything looks very detailed and alive and every screen carries a different kind of atmosphere with it The background music is nothing outstanding, but it doesnt kill the atmosphere either. 'Generic' comes to my mind here.  Still, seeing as this is an endless orgy of clicking and searching I can not recommend it at its current price of 6 Euro. Maybe some mini-games and riddles would have helped to add simply MORE CONTENT to this game. In the end I just played it to gather all achievments, having absolutely no interest for an ending (and there is only one. Why not make different endings, depending on how you choose to solve quests and stuff? A simple BAD Ending would even give more depth...)",

In addition to the obvious activity bubbles, there are also unmarked collectibles hidden throughout the world. These items for the most part are just another source of income but some also are part of crafting recipes. Everything is as simple as point and click, but rather than being boring it helps to keep the game from overstaying its welcome. The art and sound design is nearly flawless, with my only gripe being a strange soundtrack switch that happens occasionally when navigating through sections of the world and anything faster than a leisurely stroll.

There is a downside: once you've found everything there is to find (resulting in 100% achievement) the game is completely over and doesn't renew any of the fishing, hunting or shrooming quests. All in all a good, relatively short game to buy in a sale.",

It feels like a cross between a point and click adventure with some RPG-like elements and one of those hidden object games thrown in for fun. It's not overly complicated but has a lot to collect and do in a short amount of time. I managed to complete the game, and all 38 Steam achievements in about 4 hours.   A good tip: When you start hunting bears you need poison. The first way to get it is to buy it from a shady guy, but don't buy it from him. Instead advance the story a little further till you unlock someone who will craft it for you for free.",

The game makes great use of the maps by adding new items to click on as your character learns to utilize them. There are always new quests to do or activities to complete. Well worth the price during a sale.  Only issue I've had is some sound effects don't always complete so my speakers continuously play white noise until I exit the game (roughly every 20 minutes).",
