            "review_text": "I really like these games. It's like if the Total War games were all Real-time but scaled down to a more manageable, non-turnbased level. There are dozens of factions to choose from each with strengths and weaknesses and varied starting positions. If you don't want to play the grand campaign that focuses on Greece and parts of Western Anatolia, you can try to unite Greece as Philip of Macedon. You've got supply lines, varied unit types, naval combat, raiding, infrastructure and so much more. It's definitely a blast for anyone interested in either Real-time Strategy, 4x or Ancient Warfare.",

            "review_text": "Players who e.g. like the Total War Series should give this a try as well as a low cost alternative. Unfortunately, there hasn’t been much marketing investment for the game overtime, though the concept is quite interesting. The game does not split up into a strategic and a battle map respectively, but lets the player scroll into the action from a more abstract point of view. The fact that the player’s army size is limited, there are revolts, supply rules and the player faces at least constant skirmishes with his neighbours constitutes a permanent challenge. However, units gain experience, including the reduction of supply needs and the possibility to provide cities with walls helps the player to control his expanding territory. Furthermore the game is great for people interested in the history of the period.  Though not overwhelming, graphics are actually lovely and it is definitely worth giving the game a try if you are a strategy gamer. ",

It had me on the edge of my seat, sending phalanx brigades to all of my borders, and almost ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ myself when the combat music comes on, I HIGHLY reccomend it due to historical accuracy, strategic excellence, and just FUN! The only bad part is that most units of really low morale, so you can lose easily if you aimlessly throw peltasts at Phalanx units.",

The first few minutes (ok... first hour) can be a bit rough, being attacked from everywhere, running out of gold or recruits... but don't give up. It has incredible depth and strategy to it. Great replayability. And it makes you dream by taking you back to Ancient Greece.  I purchased a copy directly from the developper, so my Steam hours are but the tip of the iceberg. And yes... I bought the game three times, just to support the developpers and have been recomending it to everyone around me ever since. ",
