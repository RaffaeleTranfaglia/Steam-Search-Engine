            "review_text": "This game was recommended to me by Angry Joe, I checked out his review and was instantly interested into playing this. I love Total war to death (you can see I played shogun 2 for like 300+ hours) but I also love RPG’s like Dragon Age, Final Fantasy, and Skyrim, this was a very ambitious move on Neocore games and it very well paid off. Let me just go over the pros and cons  Pros: + The Knights of the Round: Your Knights are basicly the generals from Total war only they are supped up can kick but and take names, much like an actual RPG character they level up, learn new skills, go on quests, and gain weapons and armor, Plus who always wanted their general to wipe out an entire platoon by firing a lightning bolt. + Total War Mythology!?: Unlike in Total war this game features Creatures and monsters from various celtic mythos both evil and good….perhaps a new Age of Mythology is in order? + RPG Quests: On the map you will encounter various RPG Text style quests that your knights can go on, to gain EXP, Units, Abilities, and so on, these are key to continue the story and earn better stuff as you conquer Britannia. + Moral Alignment in Many Areas: Besides the Obvious Good and Evil (Righteous and Tyrant) there is also a Religious Alignment where you can either be a good Christian or continue the Old Ways, All Alignments have various benefits and you can go many ways like Tyrannical Christian or Righteous Old Ways ect. +Plays like Total war: If you love Total War it’s a very close replica of Total war, Granted it dose have a few flaws. + Legendary Weapons and Armor: Collect Various Weapons and Armor to Deck out your Knights to make them more Lethal.  Cons: - Your King Arthur…..and you don’t play as him??: Yeah despite you being King Arthur and having Excalibur “The Most Powerful Weapon in Britannia” You can’t actually use him in combat at all….or anything really…You can’t participate in Quests, or Join a Battle…Or Use Excalibur - Can’t Get the TRUE Knights of the Round: I’m abit of a historic nut but I have to place this as a con, If your trying to do a play by play of the Actual Arturian Legend your SOL because of the Morality system a lot of the Classic Knights of the Round you cannot obtain, In my Case I was a Righteous Old Faith King sooo I couldn’t get Gawain or Gallahad because I wasn’t a Tyrant or a Christian - Time Limit!?!?: Surprisingly there is a Time limit in the game by how many turns you can use, at a certain point in the game you will be unable to complete any more quests due to a event, hell you’ll skip several chapters if your too slow - Broken A.I: You HAVE to play this game on Easy, on Normal or Hard the A.I Breaks the game by producing units faster than you can and doing cheap tactics - Auto Battle Whats That??: The Auto Battle is useless, forcing you to play every single battle! - Reading…Zzzz: If you don’t like Reading your gonna fall asleep on some of the Quests - Chapter Jumping: Your going to be jumping chapters like Crazy after Chapter 1, I haven’t even finished a quest for Chapter 2 and I already get Quests for Chapters 3 and 4 - Mythos Units OP: If you don’t have any Mythos Units your soldiers are going to get their buts kicked, Even the Lowest Teir Mythos Units can Own your Highest Teir Soldiers (Thus making you WANT to play Old Faith 80% of the time)   In the End though Despite my Cons its still a Solid Game Regardless it just needs some fine tuning here and there, If most of these Cons are Fixed in Future Titles then King Arthur can be a Legend, but for now it’s a Ambitious Title that Works but could use some Improvements   Score: C- ",

            "review_text": "An interesting fantasy empire simulation game similar to the Total War series. Has good graphics, music, and voice acting. The combat is very cool with some unique elements such as heroes, spells, and capturable points that give your army bonuses in battle. However one glaring issue in the battle system is a complete lack of a morale system which means units will never retreat. As well as being unrealistic this means battles tend to drag on with the losing army ultimately being annihilated. This proves to an issue on the campaign map as the game is very difficult and one lost battle can be devastating since you are limited in the amount of troops you can support with your permenantly shaky economy. Disasters, rebellions, and invading armies are a constant nuisance which plays into the games difficulty as the quest system is the only way to advance the game and these elements take up time and prevent you from completing aforementioned quests. All the elements that you would expect in this genre of game are present as well as a nifty morality and religion system that determines what spells, units, and upgrades you can get as well as a text-based quest system that advances the main story. The story of course is based on King Arthur's rise to dominion over all of ancient England but with distinct fanstay elements based on old Celtic mythology. In conclusion I would recommend this to fans of the Total War series of games.",

You get quests, level-ups, kingdom, resource and hero management, large battles, and more. If you get bored of games being 'more of the same old thing', you NEED TO PLAY THIS ONE. I give it a 9.5/10! :-)  ==========  Ce jeu est une extraordinaire combinaison de jeu de rôle fantastique ainsi que de stratégie en temps réel. Il y a des quêtes, des niveaux pour tous les personnages, de la magie, ainsi que la gestion du royaume, des ressources ainsi que des héros, de grandes batailles et toute une variété de choses uniques.

            "review_text": "Wonderful game.  It is hard to adequately describe this game. It is part RTS, part TBS, and part text adventure.  Really it all comes together great, but there are a few quips. The devs made archers too strong for balance, it was patched with an option to weaken the archers however. In mideval times archers were damn effective at hailing down hell on armies. In reality this makes sense but this is a game and the difficulty presented causes the game to be a bit unbalanced.  Also, autoresolving battles is an option, but it is not ever wise to do so until very late in the campaign.  Aside from those issues this game is amazing and I am very much looking forward to the sequel. Don't bother to pick up the DLC however check metacritic first.",

            "review_text": "King Arthur is very close to the Total War games in spirit. You have champions (called Knights), leading armies on the strategic map. When these armies fight, you can control them on the tactical map where it goes from turn-based to real-time.  The main differences are the era (which involve a lot of magic), the numerous quests that the knights can do (they are completely text-based, with multiple choices), the very important personnalisation of the heroes, and the lower importance of the economy. This makes this game a very nice merging of role-playing and strategy. Another high point is the music, a bit repetitive, but quite adapted to the mood of the game.  The only clear weakness is the AI (a bit weak), and the overall difficulty of the game which is very high (it is not rare to fight at one vs 2 or three). I just finished the normal difficulty campaign, so it remains perfectly doable.",

Furthermore the the player starts always in a worse position on the map.  - AI has a better food/gold ratio of production  Basically AI plays with different rules than player.
