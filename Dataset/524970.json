            "review_text": "This is an absolutely terrible game. I mean, it's amazing how bad from a game design standpoint, but then you throw all the bugs on top and it gets pretty bad pretty fast.  Bugs: 1. Many graphical artifacts (bugs) where the developer is just too lazy to fix. (black lines on transparent textures etc). 2. Pressing the Escape key takes you out of fullscreen. (Did they just rip off the OpenGL tutorials without changing the code?). 3. Often times you have to logout and log back in just to get basic game mechanics to work (like talking to NPCs), which brings me to... 4. There is no option in the game to logout or quit in fullscreen. 5. You can wall jump straight vertical to get to areas you shouldn't be able to get to that they try to 'block' via level design. When using the bug to get outside of the level and fall through the game world? 6. Falling through the game world kills you, and you are told that 5% of your coins are taken away as punishment. 7. It was actually 50% of my coins. 11/10. Would jump exploit for 5% of coins again.",
