Instead of normal online game you now get something with 'notifications' that spam your inbox (sound effects notifying your turn were obviously found not useful and are now used when you end your turn), graphics wants to bite your eyes out and whoever did the design forgot to play the game at least once to see how it works (adding new ticket always showed you where the towns you need are, now you can't see it because there's random stuff flashlighted on the map)  Don't fix something that ain't broken?",

            "review_text": "This was a good game. However, they have updated it a couple of times and each time the game got worse. The game itself is good, though it would be nice if you could change the diffulculty settings (it's fairly easy). The artstyle was better in previous versions, but the worst part is that the settings don't work anymore (for example the fast speed button is broken). And worst of all is the increasing amount of banners, pop-ups and other commercial in-game activity that cannot be shut down. Verdict: good game, but increasingly annoying interface. Buy on sale for low price.",

            "review_text": "Ticket To Ride has been my favourite board game for about ten years now, and this addaptation is totally worth getting!  For those unfamiliar with the board game; the game has a perfect mix of luck and strategy, making each game challenging yet fun. Your goal is to finish destination tickets (e.g. New York to Los Angeles) by claiming routes on the board that eventually let you have a path going from one city to the other city on your ticket. To claim routes you need to collect train cards in the colours needed, picking your choice from the face up cards or the face down deck if no colours are available you could use. It's pretty straight forward and you get the hang of it very fast.  Then each map (in this case DLC) has it's own extra rules to add a little challenge and to make no two boards play the same way, making them also worth getting!  This game addaptation has its flaws, yes. The online games can be hit or miss, though most of the time I have no problems at all playing against others, and the devs are constantly working on fixing issues. The single player games against the bots can get boring and repetitive, as each bot has their own way of playing the game and you get accustomed to it very fast. The bots are definitely good for new players though, not too tough but still challenging. And I still have fun playing against them to see how high of a score I can get or just to mess with them.  And for those who want just a little extra challenge, the achievements can be quite tricky to get. 100% hunters should be aware that one achievement will take forever to get (play 20,000 games) and that each DLC adds their own achievements. (base game has 25 achievements, each DLC adds an extra 5, Europe+1912 adds 10)",

Enough has been said about the game mechanics etc. in other posts, and just as most I do enjoy a nice round of planing, scheming and backstabbing against/with other real players.  But there's another aspect which forced me to give a negative rating: Under Ubuntu 14.04 (as well as all other Linuxes according to the TTR steam forum), the DLCs do not work any more after the last update, meaning I cannot play on the additional maps I paid for! The publisher is aware of the problem, yet a solution is not in sight.  As soon as this problem is resolved, I will change my review as the game itself is fine. But as nothing has changed over the last two months, I can't help do feel deceived so far.",

Unfortunately a recent update (November 2015) has made everything so much worse, and it's honestly one of the worse updates to a game I've ever seen with tons of bugs. Now there are graphical glitches, buttons don't work, there's multiplayer connectivity problems, the AI is worse, unnecessary route completion animations are present, the end-game score count is slow, and so on. Until these are fixed I cannot recommend the game in its current state.  There was nothing to warrant this update, so I don't understand why the producers would trash a game that was working extremely well. Seems like a waste of time and effort.

There are...a couple major issues however that may make playing the game a major turn-off for some.  The Good:  +Like I said, gameplay. Simple, board game like, timer to keep you going, etc. If you've played the board game, you'll know what to expect.  +Multiplayer. God, you would wish that this would just be a given, but given the glitches the game has, it's a major plus that it works somewhat properly. So, yea. Nice that it doesn't crash and I can play with my friends. +Music/Speech/Sounds. Nothing to call home about, but they're pretty nice.  The Bad: -Oh god, the interface. So bad. So, so bad. For starters, the conductor will not turn off his initial speech after you've gone through the first menu. It'll repeat, every single time. You can turn that annoying factor off somewhere deep, deep in the settings, but until them, prepare to suffer. -Doesn't always install correctly. So, I got this off of Humble Bundle and am very glad that we had another place to download it from because the Steam version doesn't always install correctly. And, actually, the HB website version required some fixing as well. My friend had to go through some steps before she could get it to work, but, mine worked fine. So, it's a grab bag.  -Confusing set-up. The settings aren't really intuitive. So, making a game, changing something, or doing something isn't really easy and doesn't come with a solid explanation. Shame.  Overall: If you get the game to work, its fun. Nothing really fancy, a very lightweight board game port that passes the time and once you get everything all sorted out is quite fun. If you have the glitches however, good luck.",

Most of the pluses of course come from the well designed nature of the underlying board game it is based off. Essentially each turn you get to do one of a few different actions - draw a couple of carriage cards which come in various different colours (or an engine that effectively works as a joker) - either face up ones (so both you and your opponents know what you are getting) or from the face down pile. If you have enough carrriages in a single colour you can use them to build a section of track, or you can pull out three extra route cards (each having two cities you have to connect up, and how many extra points it is worth if you do so - also the penalty if you don't connect them by the end of the game) each of which you can keep or not.  From this relatively simple seeming set of options, the strategic options get very deep and complicated if you want to take the time to study what is going on, or the game can just be played as a fun family game, it works either way. Should you try to get more route cards early so you know everywhere you need to connect up from the start, or should you wait until the ones you start with are completed routes and then see if you can get some quick and easy expansions near the end of the game? Should you play your carriages early to avoid being blocked on that section of track, or risk waiting to avoid giving clues to where you are planning to move next? Should you block that opponents obvious route attempt knowing that might decide to retaliate and make one of your route cards difficult or impossible to complete? Should you pick up a couple of same colour face up cards that you don't really at the need all that much to make it look like you are planning to go down a different route than you really need to head?",
