A dating simulator that supports gay and lesbian couples, has witty remarks, funny restraunt names, and difficult minigames.  For a casual game, it's great. I don't know why it's so fun, but it is.  I even got to set up Kitty Powers at the end! You go kitty! I love you!",

I rumaged through the choices and offered her the top three candidate profiles, all of which sounded pretty lame but it was the best Kitty Powers' Matchmaking Offices had to offer. With absolutely nothing in common except his documented obesssion with blue eyed beauties, Liberty took my advice and went on a date with loser #1. The evening started horribly, Liberty having selected all-American fine dining at its best with real authentic truck-stop flavours. Except Greg, her date, wants some fancy red meat dish with milk and the only thing on the menu is corndogs and french fries. Liberty suffered through Greg's talks of UFO's and internet meme's, eventually realizing through dull conversation that he shared none of her interests such as celebrity gossip or clowns. At the end of the date, Liberty thought she'd give it one more shot by asking Greg out for a second date. Greg is fairly unimpressed at this point and wants Liberty to beg for a second date. Liberty begs. Guess she swiped right after all.  This game is great and doesn't discriminate. It's a fun little memory game with unique profiles for all the clients and date candidates. 10/10 for being Fabulous.",

Sometimes it is pretty darn frustrating and difficult - I was taken aback when I suddenly had to remember what my waiter looked like, or remember the name of my date. It basically trains your short term memory to ensure you remember little details. I am STILL trying to figure out what 'type' of person people are - over time, I am starting to recognize certain patterns of interests so I can pinpoint who is 'Edgy' type or 'Geek' type, for example. I'm still lost about Glam versus Chic, though. I can see myself playing this game on and off for a long time because it is so easy to pick up then put back down again.",

You don't go on the dates but you are there watching and guiding responces and playing all kinds of many games. like match it, solts, memory, spin the wheel. YOu have to listen to the date's likes and wants. I wasn't expecting to like this game much but i do. It has a bit of british humor and terms that might be confusing at first but you do catch on rather quickly.   in case anyone is curious . . . no you Don't play as Kitty. you make your own character, She is your boss.",

Then must do math (thank gods Prunk had calculator), use memory skills, and play guessing games to make client date a happy date. Sometimes, it no work out and Prunk lose client when they had three bad dates which make Prunk want to work harder on next one.  A slot/fruit machine give you choices of questions to ask date what they like. You get more choices with career promotions from Kitty Powers. Kitty Powers is cooky fun - Prunk like her style! Game start with a few restaurants to take date on, then you can buy more restaurants which open more fun mini games.  If you believe (Prunk does not) that a person need change to make other person happy, you can buy salon things to change client's hair color, face accessories and so on. Sometimes Prunk changes client hair color to suit date's taste, but not so much other stuff. Many choices to make in game, many fun minigames, and Prunk have fun trying to figure character peoples' personalities.  Tutorial is nice and Prunk lose much time playing game. Game should come with warning that could harm real relationships because love playing game too much, hahaha. Prunk, though, recommend game - very fun game.  EducatedOrc Prunk say:  Fun &amp; Entertaining - 5 / 5 grunts Skill Leveling - 5/5 Action Intensity - 1 / 5 grunts Storyline - 4 / 5 grunts Addictive - 5 / 5 grunts OVERALL - 4 out of 5 grunts",

Instead of going on dates yourself, you guide your clients through their date with the girl/guy you think is right for them. You can also choose which restaurant they go to. The restaurants have 3 levels; easy, medium, and hard. You can also change the way your client looks before your date.   If you succeed, they get together. Afterwards, depending on how you acted on the date, they'll break up. They can also get married and have kids if you did well on the date.  If you fail (AKA get dumped), you have to try again with another person. If you fail 3 times in a row, they'll leave the agency, and your reputation will drop.  Sometimes, you'll get stuck in the middle, and have to go on three dates before you succeed (or fail).",
