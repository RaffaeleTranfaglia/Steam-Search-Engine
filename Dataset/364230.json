    "description": "Lucius game has been demade, and is now ready for mayhem. Enjoy all the gore now in fewer pixels and fewer colors. The original game has been fully demade to achieve the atmosphere of an 80's style gory adventure. Lucius is now killing all the pixels and there isn't a damn thing anyone can do about it.",

The storyline very interesting and pulls you in to play more. I haven't played the original Lucius, so I can't compare the storyline to the original and whether it is faithful to it or not, but I'd say this one is very well done, nevertheless.",
