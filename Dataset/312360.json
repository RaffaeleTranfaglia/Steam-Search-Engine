            "review_text": "AGEod is a great strategy engine and WWI is a forgotten war in videogames. So this is a very good combination. Honestly, it's not easy and not easy to learn. We need much time to understand the mechanism - even if you play with American Civil War for ages - and we need time to set everysmall details in the turns. But it worth the time. Oh, and this is an another 'one more turn' wargame.",

For Ageod starters i advise to play Alea jacta est ,also here on steam, first. Its less complex and easier to get into Ageod games. Its all about the supply thats the first hard thing to learn.",

            "review_text": "I have been playing AGEod games since the first release. The games have always amazed me by the combination of strategy yet details. Simplicity yet complexity. It is up to you how detailed you decide to go, but for those that simply love strategy, you can focus there. For those that want to dive into details, you have that option as well.   To End All Wars is no exception, tackling WWI, an era that, in retrospect, had a more profound impact on our world today than I ever realized. ",
