Most important part of VN is writing and this one is decent at least, with some good moments. Worst part is the begining. It's highly unbelievable and it feels cheap, but it gets better. Art isn't perfect, I've seen better, but I also have seen much, much worse many times. Artist who drew characters can get very good soon, if she/he still practice. Yes, I have to agree with some people that it kinda feels like Katawa Shoujo rip off, but is it that bad if you get your ideas from the best? I really wanted to see how it ends so i hope one day i'll get another chapter",
