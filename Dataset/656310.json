    "description": "Dracula has summoned you to prepare his library for his coming absence. Dracula's books need to be safe for a long period of time. Many of the ancient texts cannot be touched by mortal hands or they will be damaged beyond repair. You must use your wand of lightning to invoke numerous spells to organize and seal the ancient tombs.",
