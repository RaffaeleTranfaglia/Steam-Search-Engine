            "review_text": "Simple puzzle game where there are 51 mahjong solitaire puzzles altogether. Gameplay involves removing matching pairs of exposed tiles to eventually remove all tiles from the game board. Completing each set of 3-puzzle stage will unlock additional mahjong solitaire puzzle stages, featured characters and their outfits for gallery and achievements. The difficulty of the puzzles range from easy to complete in one attempt to difficult puzzles that require many retries after reaching a dead end or running out of time. Soundtracks are decent and overall presentation depending on player progress with unlocks is also nicely done. Recommended when game is at discount as it takes anywhere from 10 to 20 hours to try to complete all puzzles or less than half that number if to try all unlocked stages at least once.",

            "review_text": "Don't be fooled by the screenshots, while they seem to convey a shallow experience to finish in an hour or two, this game is honestly hard as nails to finish. It's the more, in the west, common match-the-tiles-game, and start off fairly easy, but once the difficulty starts rising, by god is it rising. Beyond the obvious failstate that is 'no more tiles to match', you also have a timer ticking down. In addition to this, when the tiles get randomly placed there's a major risk that you'll get a setup that you cannot win, no matter skill, and in my playthrough half my losses was due to this. That said, the game evoke the same feeling where every loss makes you more determined that many find in games like Dark Souls after enough losses. In fact, I for one forgot the whole 'Pretty Girls' part of the game until victory was mine. Be warned though, you who are here primarily for the anime images, there's no gallery for the various outifts after you beat the required stages, which is a bit of a let down.  So all in all, it's flawed, but I recomend it. As long as you have up to ten or so hours to spend on finishing it.",

            "review_text": "When I first saw this game, I instantly knew what kind of game it would be: a basic mahjong solitaire game with softcore anime pin-up girls in it. The idea was pretty straightforward. I'm not the biggest fan of anime, but I'm always up for a good game of mahjong, so I decided to buy it. Was it worth it?  The short answer is yes. For the price I bought it ($1.50), I got my money's worth and then some. I found a fun mahjong game that was short but challenging. The anime girls were just a bonus, but they were worth seeing after each round. Sure, some of the sounds the girls made were a bit strange, but at least the music was pretty catchy.  A message to potential buyers: if you want this game, get it when it's on sale. There's not enough content to warrant a $15 price tag. However, for the price I got it for, it was an excellent casual game that any fan of mahjong (or puzzle games in general) should have in their collection.",

            "review_text": "I was pleasantly surprised by this game; with all the negative reviews, I thought the gameplay would be awful. It's not. It's a Mahjong solitaire game, and apparently some people have no idea what that means. Sometimes, you're going to farckerberg your tiles to where you end with an unsolvable puzzle. Sometimes random generation can do this to you, same as any solitaire game (or so I understand it, because when I couldn't finish a puzzle in this game it's been wholly my fault for not playing different combinations, etc). The nudity title is wholly misleading, because there is no nudity, and having cleared all five stages I can tell you the most revealing outfit is a bikini. This is NOT a game to play if you're looking for nudity; it IS a fun Mahjong solitaire game though. Is anyone else old enough to remember Taipei? It's Taipei with anime girls. After clearing the five stages though it definitely loses appeal; I think a random puzzle shape generator would have increased the replay value for me. All in all, a fun game at a cheap price.  TL;DR: For playing, not for fapping. Occasionally requires mental effort on your part.",

            "review_text": "Mahjong Solitaire is a classic, and this version is faithful to the original, tile-matching game.  What makes the Pretty Girls version better than the free games on your phone is the incentive to unlock all the costumes for each girl. There are five girls with 4 or 5 costumes each - note that we're not stripping the girls, just changing their clothes. There's no nudity here, and no patch to unlock it (unlike Hunie Pop) because it doesn't exist.  The gameplay is fun, but expect to have to replay the puzzles dozens of times in the later stages to solve them. It took me 90 minutes just to unlock Ayame's second costume. It's addictive, though, I couldn't put the game down until I did it!  When you've unlocked every costume, which took me 7.5hrs, there's little reason to play anymore. And for that reason, I can't recommend the game unless it's on sale - I got it for 90% off in the Steam winter sale.  Speaking of price, it boils my balls to see Zoo Corporation mark up the price for customers in Japan, and I was THIS close to giving the game a negative review because of it.   TL;DR  Addictive, tile-matching game with pretty girls to motivate you. Not enough content to warrant full price. Buy on sale only.",

            "review_text": "#1 It's my very first negative review... didn't expect that comming when I started the game (still did 100% achievements).  So at the beginning I really need to underline that I really really wanted to like this game and I tried to skip all neglects... till chapter with Kanon, as the seiyuu was soo freaking annoying that I had to turn the voice off. Her 'mero mero' &amp; 'hayako' made me look more and notice much more negative aspects of this game.  It's anime themed mahjong... 2 things I really enjoy in almost every possible way (that's why I tried so hard to like it), I mean... common... it's mahjong and anime what can possibly go wrong? Well, I didn't know back then that so many things can go wrong...  Pros (+):     Music, pretty nice, relaxing = suitable for this kind of game (got boring though after some hours)     Nice anime looking girls in different clothes (A LOT OF B00BS, as someone mentioned: day without boobs is wasted day)     Not hard achievements, as they just come with progress (I like some harder ones, but it's not bad as well).     Cheap (wait on sale, I bought it for 0,99$)   Cons (-):    This game doesn't have contrast colors! I mean you are solving this mahjong and the colors of 'plates' is so pale that it's harder and harder too see pairs with game progression and harder stages. After playing some hours you are just tired of even looking at it. This was the biggest disadvantage for me.     Only 'HARD MODE'... generally you can't choose, just play it. Not everyone is playing mahjongs for achievements or just to finish it once and never play again... it should have the option to 1) show available 'plates' to use; 2) hints; 3) possibility to undo the move (one time back); 4) Not everyone likes to be limited by time...    Game for one time to play. You finish it, make all achievements and you will never want to play it again as there are a lot of better mahjongs that are fun to play and you can play the whole hours at once and you won't get tired but have fun.    Voice that is used for girls and every 4 (?) pairs you get is turned on. I can't explain too well what I mean here. But in the nutshell, if you get the pairs very fast as me and the voice starts every 4 pairs you get it's getting so freaking annoying (repeating all the time without break) that it forced me to turn off the voice and turn on Morrowing theme in the background. You need to play it with Kanon character to fully understand me and get the pairs fast.  Conclusion: I got some free app (Mahjong Legends) on my cell phone and it's much more well build. It has highest scores when you got a good time, dozens of different boards that sometimes are extraordinary fun to do, etc...  ",
