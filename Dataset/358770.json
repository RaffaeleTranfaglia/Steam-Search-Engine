Very good unique art style. The plot is fun and interesting.  Nice soundtrack Low price.  Cons: A bit too short. Sometimes the narrative can get a little confusing. Not many CGs.",

            "review_text": "Cute and interesting, The Reject Demon: Toko Chapter 0 - Prelude is pretty good. It definitely makes me excited for the next chapters  The character art is beautiful. The characters themselves seem defined and individual (No character shares too simular of speech patterns.) Sound design is good. The relationship between Toko and Nadia is cute and their personalities contrast and harmonize just enough to make the relationship feel genuine and sincere.  I loved the beginning story of how Toko and Nadia met, super cute!  The only thing I disliked is that Nadia's advances feel too rushed in the beginning, though that is later explained. Even so it made it difficult for me in the beginning before knowing the reasons for Nadia being so forward, it felt out of character for the Nadia that had just been presented. (This may be me looking too deep or just me assuming that Nadia wouldn't be the type to flirt like that in the beginning. I may just be picky.)  I tend to prefer to watch feelings develop over time, but this does make more room for us to see where the relationship goes and how it will change. Too many dating sims/ visual novels stop when the characters come together and you never really see how the relationship grows.  So in summary: It is worth checking out. and I'm excited to see how the dynamics of their relationship changes over time and with new challenges.",

            "review_text": "I would like to start this review off with a disclaimer, this chapter is AMAZING!   BUT, I am noticing a trend of VNs lately releasing things episodically, and there is nothing wrong with that IF you have an ACTUAL release schedule in place already. Right now this game is nothing but a tease with the promise of a game that will come.....eventually. No set release dates, no real promises, and very little information is given other than, 'we have two games coming out before releasing the other chapters for this.' And, of course, no set release dates on those either. So late leaves me here, buying a TASTE of a wonderful game or at least the idea of one with no view of the main course in sight.  To be fair, while surfing through the discussions I did see a post from the developer that stated that one of the games slated to come out before this one has some projected time periods of 'sometime during the winter, we hope, but not nessicarily this one.' That leaves me even more annoyed,  If they put out some proper dates on the future of this series then I will GLADLY change this review to a recommended because the setting, the characters and the story telling meathod are all so amazing, but until they get their release schedule in order I cant, in good heart, recommend this chapter to anyone.",
