            "review_text": "I've played FOF7 off and on now for ove a year since it's release.   So what is good about the game?  You are going to get an incredibly strong simulation of being a General Manager. Yoru decisions matter in a lot of ways. Is it worth picking up that stud free agent if he doesn't get along with the position leader? Should I spend my money on one big name, or spread it improving my squad with a few players instad? Should I gamble on that top rated Qb even though he has a high volatility and could be a huge bust? How likely are the combine scores to matter in figuring out which top player to pick at my 1.11 spot in next year's draft? Do I have coverage in case my starting RB is ut for injury? And how how of my salary cap should be invested in quality backups? Should i move to a 3-4 defense so I can focus on getting quality LBs? After a season of play, why did my 64/64 rated DE just get four sacks? What can I do to inprove his perforamnce next year? How long should I hold on to my aging QB as he begins to slip from All Pro to Pro Bowl, and looks to be getting worse? Do I even have enough cap room there? Should I franchise tag my good TE&lt; even though I'll be forced to pay him a lot more than I otherwise would have to do? Whcih is better for my coach, playcalling or injury avoidance? Should I build a new stadium or just re-finance my current one? If I decide to leave town for a better city, where should I target? A team in my division just offered me a really good trade, should I take it, even though I'll likely strengthen a fellow divison rival with it? How high can I increase my ticket prices before people stop coming to my games?   As you can see, there are a ton of questions, mechanics, skillsets, finances, and more to balance. That's the good of the game!  But, the games UI isn't going to win any awards. The graphics sometimes look like they are a few years out of date. So frankly, I'd rate it a 10/10 for gameplay, but a 6/10 for presentation.  It's worth it. And more.  ",

            "review_text": "I'd played this game for many years before it migrated to Steam. It's a game designed for the consummate geek: a text-based simulation that gives you the ability to micromanage a football team. There are no graphics to speak up and, beware, the interface and looks are kind of ugly. A true geek, however, doesn't care about any of that, and you'll find that the game engine is very deep and impossible to quite figure out, as the interplay of elements is so mysteriously woven with chance and there are so very many of them in the first place. FOF is an art as much as a science.   At first the game is fascinating in SP, but eventually you will find your way to MP because it's really the only way to play. The SP game-engine is challenging but only to a certain degree. An MP league, however, gives you a shot at a deeply immersive experience along with regular yet powerful doses of excitement. Imagine simulating an entire season over the course of three months, at a leisurely pace of one stage a day -less during the regular season: maybe just two or three games a week (different leagues follow different rhythms, simming as fast as one season a week, and you can join as many as you can handle). Imagine a live draft -thanks to Wheels' third party browser app- with hard time limits and all the excitement of the blockbuster trades and the pick-by-pick analysis of the local Mayocks in the chat room -a little hangout not unlike watching NFL network. The suspense of training camp as you wait for the verdict on the players you drafted, the development of young players, and the decline of veterans. The chess game of game-planning against human players during the regular season. The drama of the playoffs. The fun team reports written by dedicated owners and posted in the web forums. And all in a friendly atmosphere of camaraderie. There is no bullying in MP leagues, and shy owners can keep a low profile if they wish. A bit of banter, sure, but well within the limits of good taste (I suspect there's a very healthy age distribution among GMs). Besides, there is no such a thing as a player who always wins so the best players know better than to be arrogant.  As to the details of game play, well, you can sign coaches, franchise players, renegotiate contracts, sign free agents, change positions and weight, training camp emphasis, choose formations, coverages, defensive fronts, blitzes (and who and how many you send), tendencies (run/pass), pass-protection schemes, depth of routes, personnel by formation, make adjustments to tendencies by score and time remaining, define playing time, and so on, and in SP you can also call the plays if you wish. And of course, you can study as many stats as you can handle. However, there are elements to watching the games “live” that you will not find in the scoreboard -the equivalent of watching film- so that's a must for the dedicated GM. Finally, the cap is a serious issue in the latest version, so you will have to be very careful with the team finances. If you like, you can focus only on either roster building or game-planning and let the AI handle the rest.  There you have it. In conclusion, I'd say this is one of those cult games: either you hate it or you love it forever. And hopefully after reading this review you'll be closer to knowing which. ",

            "review_text": "The FOF series has been one of my favorites since it first came out in 1998 and FOF7 is by far the best of the series. Sure, there aren't any fancy graphics, but what beats in the heart of this game is the most realistic football simulator ever created. Believe me, I've looked. So if you're tired of simulating games of Madden where the AI gives your star RB only 3 carries and the final score is 15-6, this is the game for you.",

            "review_text": "Outstanding computer football game to the core. Would recommend to anybody who loves NFL football or any version of American football. Worked great from day one and is easy to play. Loved the way the game engine breaks down the season to create an offseason where you can Hire/Fire Staff members, sign Free Agents, Draft incoming college players and rework your entire roster. I also like the coaching features where you can adjust your gameplan and even scout your opponent. I do see some minor drawbacks like forcing a team to carry three QB's on the active roster and no 10 man Practice Squad but overall it hits all the major issues that other football sims seem to either ignore or simply do a bad job with.",

            "review_text": "This game will give you everything you are looking for if you are someone who played Madden or NCAA football without actually playing the game. By that I mean you can fine tune every aspect of the game to how you want your team to lose. Imagine picking up a stud QB in the draft, game plan to his strengths. After training camp you find out he cant throw the ball over 20 yards without hitting a defender, change the coach's scheme to play the short game. Dump off passes will go to your RB more often, learning your RB has stone hands become evident. It all snowballs based off your little designs.  You have the chance to truly find gems in the draft. Snagging a DE and successfully converting him to a 3-4 OLB is a very nice feeling. Injuries are only as accurate as what your staff tells you. If your strength coach is a 'special' guy, he may green light a minor injury that costs a player his leg. I've had a guy listed on the injury report for optomology (sp?), the amount of detail the guy put in to making this game is more vast than anything we collectively could have imagined.  The true beauty of this game is finding a multiplier league that has a good commissioner. I just completed my first 32 team draft this morning and I was glued to the damn computer. Anxiously waiting to see if the guy I really wanted would fall to me or not. Thinking you found a gem and having someone else pick them before you. I can't stop playing this game. The St. Louis Rams organization looks forward becoming a part of the Albuquerque community.",

It may seem daunting at first but you can play and win with varying degrees of input. If you just want to be a general manager, you can let your staff handle all of the gameplanning and you can still do well. If you just want to coach, you can do that to. While it may not be the prettiest, it has everything you want to make a fun and deep football experience.",

Has enough variation on each start to eliminate head-hunting. The only thing I miss from past versions is the ability to set the gameplay time for individual players as opposed to the whole team but this is a somewhat minor quibble (well, that and I need to enter the real team names). Well worth the investment!",

There is very little available on the market, so I gave FOF7 a shot.   I have to say, after spending years playing other sports management sims, especially OOTP, it was a huge let down to see that FOF really hasn't evolved. This version is really no better than one I played in 2000. In fact, I think when they actually had the NFL license, the game at least looked better. The game may have some redeeming qualities, but it's really hampered by the terrible interface which makes trying to do anything a huge pain. It's a shame that the developers haven't been able to make any susbstantive improvements to what was once a great sports sim franchise.",
