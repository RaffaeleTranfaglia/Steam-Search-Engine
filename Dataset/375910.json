            "review_text": "I bought this game on Summer Sale because I was concerned with the Mixed reviews it had received from launch and I didn't want to pay full price for it on the chance it was bad. The only other Anno game I own is Anno 2070, which I enjoyed. I also enjoy this game. I feel too many reviewers are unfairly judging this game based on what they liked about Anno 2070 without understanding that not every game is going to be a copy of its predecessor with better graphics. Here is an indepth analysis of why I like the game and why I recommend people try it.  In my opinion, Anno 2205 is a shift towards a simpler and more casual gamer, which admittedly is a saavy business move as casual gamers are a much larger demographic. The things some people have been saying are negatives I actually find to be positives. The simplified supply chains for example. This game moves from micro level resource management to macro level resource management. The amount of micromanaging required in setting up trade/supply routes in Anno 2070 meant I was spending more time managing those than I was actually enjoying the game. Now the game takes care of that for me. I set up a trade/supply route and/or start up a new settlement and instantly I see the recognizable trade ships from 2070 begin to head to and from my various warehouses automatically. It's all aesthetic sure but before you'd actually have to have set all those routes up yourself. Personally I find the automation a welcome adjustment.  The removal of combat from the standard gameplay has the same tone. Nothing annoyed me more in Anno 2070 than when a pirate fleet would arrive and mess up a trade route before my fleet could intercept them, forcing me to then have to rebuild lost ships in order to resume my previous trade route(s). I'll agree that now there doesn't seem to be any penalty in not dealing with hostile forces; I was expecting there might be some timers on combat missions or you'd suffer some penalty. I'm glad there isn't because that would also have been annoying but still, the lack of any necessity to deal with combat missions other than to collect Iridium (which seems to be the super resource I tend to run out of the quickest) and Achievements does seem a touch hollow, but I'm generally okay with that.  As for replayability. There is a valid point there. Generally City Builders are best when they have replayability. Anno 2070 was ok with this. I played that game four times; once as Eden/GT, once as GT/Eden, once as Eden only, and once as GT only (I called that one Hard Mode). Thing is outside that there wasn't much for me that made replayability interesting. I'm fine with the story mode. Besides, obviously with there already being two DLC's they intend on expanding playability through expansions, which is in line with the way games are going these days.  Another thing I saw in a lot of negative reviews is that service buildings no longer have areas of effect and rather offer a flat service value (I think maybe with some penalties for being close to each other and/or distance away from population? Haven't actually paid that much attention to the nuance of it). I for one think the way it works now is overall better. Sure, it reduces some of the micromanaging aspects of city designing, but this new way is the way City Builders are going these days. I've seen this change in Sim City games, Tropico, Caesar, now Anno, generally speaking game designers are moving away from unnecessarily complex mechanics in favor of more accessible entertainment. Again I feel the shift is towards accessing more of the casual gaming market, of which I am a member, so I'm okay with that. If you want harder then artificially make the game harder. Say to yourself 'I won't build a Community Center building unless it is within a certain range of population structures and a certain distance from any other Community Centers'. There, you've increased your own difficulty while not impacting those who prefer to have fun rather than be restricted in their expansion options. Or, presuming the games permits it, make a mod that does that. I'm a big fan of making games as accessible as possible in their base mode then allowing more hardcore gamers the ability to make it more difficult on their own terms.  So that's my review. All told the game is beautiful, I enjoyed the story aspects, I found it accessible yet still challenging at times, and I'd definitely say it was worth the price I paid. I hope others will give it a try and discover the same.",

            "review_text": "First off: Ubisoft's decision to make the Frontiers DLC free to season pass owners restored a bit of my faith in a gaming industry that seems to be out to screw over customers recently.  Anno 2205's ratings took a major (and deserved) knock after they decided to charge for Frontiers. I don't know whether or not the original season pass description said that all future DLC would be free or not (it is claimed that it did) but charging for more DLC stretched the meaning of a seasons pass a lot. Ubisoft needs to be commended for reversing this decision (Take note Hello Games, you solve problems by communicating, admiting you messed up and try to fix it. Not by going underground).  Now onto the game. I did not spend more than 20 minutes on Frontiers content so I will not cover that. I will also concentrate on only 2 points because these are mostly raised in negative reviews (barring the DLC policy comments): the new way of managing resources and combat.  I will kick off by saying that this version of Anno will not appeal to all fans of the series. I have been playing the series since Anno 1503 (roughly 2003 / 2004) and I really enjoyed the the micro-management of resources and production chains, the careful placement of resource production, consumption and storage. For me this style of play culminated in Anno 1404 and more so 2070 because available building space became a scarce resource.  This Anno does not play like that. In a sense it has been simplified a lot which may be good or bad, depending on what you want out of the experience.  The management has now moved to a grander scale and keeping track of all your resources over multiple sectors with unique play styles and resources can be almost as challenging as getting a perfect production chain going on the older games. Individual sectors however have become a game of watching resource production digits and fixing the negatives.  If you want something that plays like the older versions, then this is not for you. That said, I enjoy the new play style but only because I see it as a different game altogether. I still have the older versions to go back to if I want to scratch that particular itch.  The only area where the experience doesn't work for me personally is the combat and the new crisis sectors. I get the idea behind them but the exceution lacks depth. In Anno 2070 for example you had to work to get to bullet and advanced weapon manufacturing to build a decent sized military. It had the feeling of a small scale military industrial complex behind it and I would have loved to see the developers expand on that idea instead of taking away from it.  Overall as a city builder with RTS elements I would give it a 7/10, but as an Anno game only 4/10.  I would also recommend it to anyone that enjoys city building and resource management that doesn't get too complicated.  -------------------------------------------------  TL;DR: kudos Ubisoft for changing your minds and not charging season pass owners for Frontiers DLC, good city builder game, not very good at the military aspect and overall not a perfect Anno successor. Would still recommend it, especially if you can find it on sale for 75% or less.",

            "review_text": "How I got Anno 2205 to INSTALL &amp; RUN/play:  1. Buy game on Steam. 2. Install uPlay if you don't have it.  3. CTRL+C your Anno 2205 Steam key from Steam.--You can find the key when you start the game and Steam tell's you that you may need the key. The game may not run or will crash or uPlay will state an error, but just go into the Steam SHIFT+TAB menu at that point and you may find the key--since this window always comes up until you tell Steam to not show it anymore.  4. Launch uPlay. 5. Select 'Activate a Key' (Top Right--select the game controller icon with the + symbol). 6. CTRL+V your Anno 2205 Steam key. 7. Launch Anno 2205 from uPlay. 8. You can also Launch from Steam at this point. 9. Play Anno 2205! 10. I really like this Anno 2205 game, so should you!  My thoughts: I very much enjoyed this game. I don't play city builder type games often, but the sci-fi theme caught my interest. It's a very clear and easy to use city builder with a sci-fi theme set in the far future. I'm new to this genre, but it was easy for me to understand; as well as, find out what to do next. I will continue to play this game.  I haven't had any stability issues playing this game.

It is a major departure from the way other Anno games work, but I find that it's still quite fun and retains just enough Anno feel to be something familiar yet new. I would like to have a 'sandbox' mode, but I don't miss it as much as I thought I would. Working towards building a colony on the moon has been quite enjoyable (many hours in and I'm still not on the moon!). A lot of the micro-management of trade routes and so forth has been modified in such a way to make it easier which I appreciate. Often in other Anno games, I got annoyed trying to figure out the best logistics strategy. So far in 2205, the logistic strategy element is still there, but it hasn't been as micro-managy. I even like the way they do combat now. It's sort of a separate 'mini-game' that you can choose to participate in (or ignore). If you participate, it's mostly just moving around blowing stuff up and collecting resources for use in the main game. I enjoy a click-boom game from time to time, so it's a nice mental distraction and doesn't feel like a necessary interruption to the main strategy game. Overall, I'm glad I'm playing it now.",

The world market is no longer a cheat code the way it was at launch (where you used to be able to bypass entire building lines because it was cheaper to buy from the market)  It's more true to Anno 2205 and 1404. It still has a bit of tablet game feel because of the extreme streamlining in cargo transport and the geometry, but overall I like it.

Some of the ideas for future products are creative and humoristic. The only downside is that it is rather finite. Once you've reached the top, there is not much else to do. The competitors' dialogues should also change more drastically as you progress but that's a minor detail. However, given they have already released a 'Season Pass' for a future expansion, it is more probable that Ubisoft will be adding features to make it more 'replayable'/'continuous' in the near future than not.

Pros: - Simplified Production: Now everything is descripted in production rate, so we don't have to look up the wiki to find out the optimal ratio of resource/production.  - No threat around your city: As for the time I was playing, there are no enemies popping up near your territory. While some may consider this as a bad thing, I'm the kind of player that always make peace with everyone on the map anyway.  - Good tool and UI: Building moving and mass building by click-and-drag are long awaited feature. UI is simple, friendly, and clean.  Cons: - Too few game mode: Only one career mode is available for now, though it contains all this game is to offer.  - Lack of vehicle customization: You can upgrade your ships, but not like in previous games when you can apply different items and modules to them. No research to enhance them either.  - Trading Route inefficiency: Now you can only send one ware at a time and pay hefty toll for it. I really like the trading mechanism back then, which you can prepare your own ship and freely trading around. Though managing route is one of the main chanllenge in this game.  Conclusion: This is a bold move for a long lived series like Anno. They planted a lot of new mechanism to this game while some concept may still in its infant I think, but I look forward to the future of them. Blue Byte is always one of my most respected teams, and I trust them can make another peak of this series.  TL:DR  Recommended: A great game for newcomers and STG lovers with much detail, but not so similar to the old Anno. Consider it as a new game, not a remake. ",

I like how all the sectors are connected however they are played and managed independently. I also like that the simulation runs for the entire “world” while in-game; not just the currently loaded sector. The military play leaves something to be desired, although you can play through the entirety of the game and never touch the combat missions. I suppose it was the best way to separate the combat play from the city building play. I would have liked to see more “coupling” of the city/resource management and the military stuff. In conclusion, managing the supply chains and building stuff on the moon was enough to keep my attention. Pick it up when it goes on sale and you wont be disappointed.",

It's even worse since they knew what the game would be before release as it was well publicized.  The game in it's own right is amazing.  Unlike the previous Anno's in this one resources are now flow resource, instead of gathering in a warehouse. I think this is a great change as you have so much more control. Resource gathering is fine for games with a micro scale where you manage a small city but do it in great detail. In this game you manage multiple cities on a macro scale, so flow resource makes more sense.  A lot of people are complaining about multiplayer. I don't think that is fair as this game is intended to be played over many days/weeks. It will take a while to build up large cities. How will that work with multiplayer? It's a city builder so multiplayer doesn't make sense.  A lot of detail exists in this game. People giving negative reviews seem to overlook the effort the developers put in, not fair.  Some people are saying they played 20 hours and have done everything there is to be done. To those people I send my condolences. Once you get your city big enough things start to get very complicated. It becomes an incredible balancing act between production, supply and income. Your trade network can get very complicated.  I've seen many complaints about the game not having random maps. But lets be honest, the previous anno's didn't really have random maps, it was the same islands over and over again, they were just slightly in a different position every time. You can't have random maps and meaningful maps at the same time. This game has meaningful maps, and they are so large that it really doesn't matter. Even more the amount of time you will spend in a single game, random maps also becomes irrelevant. The maps have so much detail and is incredibly beautiful, they deserve praise.  The game does have sandbox mode, the campaign is the sandbox. the first few missions is just to get you started on your sandbox experience.  People complain about the naval battles, but these are entirely optional and are only for rewards, that you can get in other ways. This is a city builder not a RTS. The battles are fine for the type of game.  I only have two complaints about this game:  The world market needs work as it is a bit unbalanced. But since you can completely ignore it in your game and still be very successful, it's not that big of a complaint.  There seems to be a bit of a memory leak if you play for a long time, that slows down the game. Restarting the game solves the problem though.",

In comparison, 2205 seems very empty. Only a main storyline to play through, not much point to keep going once you complete it, no factions to choose from for replayability. In short, it desperately needs DLC, and lots of it. It feels more like a game engine than a game, at times.  But all this aside, 2205 is a great game.

Anno 2205 takes a pretty sharp turn from the other titles, and on first look I was worried about all the same things everyone else is. I gave it shot anyway, and I am really glad that I did.  My perspective may be out of the mainstream - I don't like combat, and never found the AI-MP aspect of earlier games to be all that interesting. I want a nice city builder with complex production chains and resource management, no combat. And 2205 fits perfectly into that hole. While I am a little disappointed the min/maxing of warehouse efficiency is no longer possible, the whole concept of warehouses and logistics are still there... they're just abstract. They become cumbersome in the late game - and the new trade routes need some cost balancing and hopefully improved UI - but they're still pretty easy to work with. It saves a lot of time, not having to track down where specifically your shortage is coming from and work on that particular bit of island. There's still tracking down and finding things, but it's more manageable.  And I think that's the real issue for long-time fans, is that some of the things that we felt 'made' the game - trade routes, warehouses, environmental effect, city centers - are now abstract under-the-hood concepts that look like they are missing when you first start the game. Most of them show back up eventually, often in new and unexpected ways.   I will say, I am really disappointed at the lack of random map generation. At least so far - I haven't beaten it yet so maybe that's a game+ mode or something, but I doubt it. I suspect that will affect replayability.  However the reality is Anno 2070 wasn't all that great until it had an expansion DLC - I suppose 2205 will improve greatly then too. It's a shame that this is how games are nowadays but it's how it is with AAA games.   Don't believe the haters. This game is fun, and a lot more complex than people are suggesting. It's less tedious than previous titles in some important ways, but still presents a lot of logisitcal and puzzle-like challenges.",

            "review_text": "Okay, so first off, after about 17 hours of gameplay I can say I have finished the main story line and therefore believe I am ready to truly talk about the game itself.  Here is the pros and cons:  Pros: + lovely asthetics, everything looks and feels very well made. + very well made music track + the new map system is very nice, and while you will have to load between changing to the different maps, you can often check up on other things such as trade routes. + the mechanics have been 'streamlined' a bit more. Instead of having only a number with the amount of goods in storage and a small arrow to mark if it is increasing or decreasing, they now show you much you actually get 'overflowing'. And you can see how much you have in storage by hovering over the resource. + the UI is a lot sleeker now and hides a lot better everything, but at the same time gives you much information by a few button clicks. Wanna check how much goods is made/used up? One click. Also more emphazism on the different hot keys (a to promote, c to copy a building, d to destroy, m to move) + the modular system is absolutely wonderful and gives new depth. You no longer 'have to' put down all those farm bits for 100% working condition, but if you spend more place you can get up to 300-800% effectivity at the maintenence of 150-500%. It gives you new reason to attempt to build up a perfect system where everything fits a'la tetris. + some smart small things, such as capability to press on a specificed sea or mountian spot and simply build what you want like that.  Cons: - the old trade system where you could use say one ship to transport six different kinds of things are completely gone. Whilst the new one is good I still wished we could somehow upgrade and make our transports bigger for having different kinds of material on same transport. - crisis zones are only really there since they choosed not to have war in your sectors, and that would be hard with war on nine different fronts, and the only us for them is to get rare materials, which you can later get with a project. Also they quickly become a chore. - the content amount maybe feels a bit to small. Yes there is nine projects you can do plus increase your military rank to new heights, but it quickly becomes the same old grind. - no multiplayer, in any form except for the world market that interacts with all players, also the Council.  - as of right now, no random true sandbox maps. The nine maps are the ones you get.  While yes Anno 2205 has deviated a lot and as many people say they have not followed the true spirit of the Anno games, I absolutely still love this. It is a fresh breath of air, giving us a new onlook from the old games. Anno 2205 is no clone, copy or retexture of any of the old games, as it is truly new mechanics. Do I say these mechanics are good? Well not always, but they are really all not that bad as some people would like you to believe. And the thing is the things we've lost to this Anno game is due to something we've all be screaming that we wanted, the multi-map system. For example the old trade system, setting them up in nine different sectors? Count me out. If you thought it could be complicated with one map and the old trade system, try nine with the old one. Also multiplayer (which we might see in the future?) I have to ask how they would implement it. Maybe through players having same company? Well the maps are now saved on your computer and there is very little usage of the internet and cloud. Most likely it would lag and in need of hosting from a certain computer. As the chosen computer probably would have to send information about all the different maps. And since there is nine maps right now only you cannot have another company.   So yea, I believe they done everything right to take the Anno series in a new direction, which I am interested to see how it will be because I believe, the multi-map system is here to stay, and that is for a long long loooooooong time.",

Sure they removed a lot of tedium, I no longer need to have 4 different tabs of my internet browser open just to find out how much fish I need to produce! I can just look it up in game.  The only thing that annoyed me somewhat is that they removed competitors within sector. You no longer have anyone to worry about and can build cities as much as you want without Sokow Transnational stealing your islands and polluting the environment.  But then lets be honest, you probably just cheesed anno 2070 and took all the islands you needed in first 5 min into your game.  Yes resources are limitless - but they were also limitless in anno 2070, all you had to do is build a small science settlement!  The best aspect of this game so far in my opinion is the campaign. Don't get me wrong - there is actually no campaign, rather a set of tasks, and its up to you how you tackle them. You are normally given a general objective and it is up to you to decide how you want to achieve it. Nobody holding your hand. If you want you can leave campaign for a while and do sector-wonder projects or whatever they are called.   Graphics of this game are INCREDIBLE!!! For a game that is a 2d citybuilder I really didn't expect such amazing visuals!   There are some gameplay elements missing so far which I hope will be added in the future - there are no monthly missions that you can do (such as financial crisis in anno 2070).

The giant game publishers take heat for releasing buggy games too soon, or milking a franchise with cookie cutter sequels... well this game is neither of those things. It's a very polished game, and it is very successful in trying to innovate the franchise whose previous sequels never involved much more sophisticated than 'more stuff.'   That said, whenever you deviate from a core mechanic like that, it's going to take some hits from the die hard fans of the franchise who were perfectly okay with 'just more stuff.'  There is value here though. They streamlined the production chain system and actually give you feedback on your 'product balance,' something that was always an element but always kept a secret from you unless you manually counted buildings. Overall it feels a bit simplistic but there is some fun gameplay to be gotten out of it if you're open to adjusting to something similar but new.",

The graphics are amazing and everything runs smooth at 1440p - looking to try 4k out at some point.  The only annoying/negative aspect is the story aspect and kinda being spoon fed what to do next, etc. It appears to lay off a bit once you get into the game more but its a pitty its not like the previous free-roam continious mode from 2070.

Rather than posting a review after less time than it takes to complete the first mission and declaring this 'Not My Anno' like many reviewers who havent played since Anno was a faux-historical game.  2205 Is clearly an evolution of the franchise It takes a lot of what worked with 2070 and expands on it while scalng back some of what did not. Production is a lot easier to manage. City building can be done with an eye towards style rather than trying to maximize a social buildings footprint. Instead of the strange magic that people within a certain radius suddenly have their social needs met, the roads play a part now from what ive seen, better road planning can maximize the area of effect of buildings to an extent.  For those who claim the 'challenge' is gone after playing 45 minutes have not progressed to the Artic map yet where the return of the dreaded sphere of infunence actually makes sense in the form of 'heat'. Certain buildings will give off a heat radius that is needed for housing which makes the city planning more of a challenge. I can only imagine the moon at this point.  The game runs bug free so far for me, it looks gorgeous and is easy to pick up and play even if you are not a vet without dumbing it down.  A lot of reviews are claiming its been dumbed down, but it is fact simply better optimized to remove a lot of the nitpicky micromanaging that got so tedious late in the game. Instead its streamlined, it still requires you to pay attention but it is possible to play and plan a successful settlement without resorting to yield calculators and placement charts which always took me personally out of the game and made previous Annos a chore late in the game.  This review is admittedly only about 5-6 hours of playtime but I wanted to give it a fair try before posting.",

Anno 2205 has some ups and downs, but overall I do enjoy the game. It's far less reliant on tedious micro management of resources, supply lines, and trade routes between islands, which is nice. You're not counting farms and calculating production based off eco rating to determine how many sushi joints you can build without running out of rice. You build a farm, it makes 5 moon rocks, you expand it, it makes 10. End of story. Simple. Which allows you to play across multiple maps, (which probably sucks for loading time on lower end systems) which is really cool. Expansion into space was a neat feature, as well as the costly trade routes to get out there. Not too many complaints; the questing is more like an annoying side-track quest, I'd like to see a return of underwater construction, and the game feels very linear. I'd like to see scenarios and open build again. And then there's the combat; although the new system is interesting, it's also fairly.....disconnected. You fight on one map, build on another, the two never touch. There are no military threats in your own seas, which is odd. But your ships don't get better via tech, but rather by the number of battles you fight and money. Not as many interesting ships, either. Like; there's no submarine that fires nukes at people. Personal preference rules on the combat system, I like both, but kind of prefer the anno 2070 system. Oh and also, no major world event vote for crap every 15 seconds bullcrap. Anno 2070 was clearly meant to be play at least once every 2 days, I do like not having my notification bar filled to the bring every time I log in lol  In the end, still like the game, still looking forward to DLC and how patches change the gameplay.",

When you are away in a different zone, the time in other zones still progresses. If they were to have a stockpile type of model, you would have exubirant ammount of resources stock piled in other zones when you eventually return there, and it would make the game pointless and without a challenge.  The supply chains in this game are complex and involved. If you loved managing production, supply, transportation, etc.. from the previous titles, you will absolutely love it here. It's even more involved.   A lot of care went into the world. As production grows, on screen traffic of supply and cargo ships expands.

They are horribly implemented, boring and long if you do the sidequests for the extra necessary resources. Also they are part of the story, I had to complete two up until now. Let's hope that one of the DLC sectors will provide an alternative in acquiring the rare materials.   Verdict: the game is good, looks nice, plays nice. The price and the crisis sectors are big negatives though. If you just want to play an Anno game, buy 2070, it's cheaper and more fleshed out.

Streamlined from its predecessors Can see the tech eveolution from 2070 The moon, always a win DlC feels ok (pre orbit will comment on that after). Though tundra felt like it was missing something Economy with stock and money is eeasier to manage because the information is presented better.  The companion app... oooo i love playing it when im bored and cba to playa real game, this results in only needing to do  the required naval missions.(go donwload it and stop complaining about the material requirements... sheesh)  All in all, id rate it as thus: Music 8/10 no where near as beatiful as 2070 but still pretty. Gameply 7/10 due to hindered replayability Graphics 9/10 Very beatiful game Optimisation, complicated, at first.. OH MY SWEET MOTHER OF MECHA OIL! it was bad. Now its pretty much fixed i rarely get frame drops on ultra this resuslts in a 6/10  Average rating - 8/10  Purchasing advice buy it on sale, get the season pass (game feels better with it(Pre-orbit))  Installation Advice check youve go tthe latest drivers - it will whine like Bulma from Dragonball if you dont.   Update 04/10/17 i change my rating by miles 2/10 this is what happens to you for standing by them and liking the game, Frontiers isnt in the season pass. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ttery of a giant magnitude.

Having loved Anno 2070, I KNEW the next one would be awesome. I was hoping for space, so, so, hoping for space. . . .and then Anno 2205 came out. I read the negative reviews, and I told myself it couldn't be that bad. I waited for it to go on sale, where as I paid full price for Anno 2070, just in case I would regret the full price tag. Even so, even at the high discounted rate, I was disappinted. Even after reading all the bad reviews, playing Anno 2205 and experiencing it myself was such a huge let down. Everything I loved about Anno games is gone. Its so dumbed down. No more resource management or careful production planning, no more map creation, all gone. Just plop buildings down whereever, build a road and sit. Its stupid, mindless and boring. Is this supposed to be a console game? A tablet game? What? It certainly isn't a PC game. Even the map is annoying. No more random maps, no more panning map view able to just pan over to other islands or catch whales swimming or watch shpis (now all map areas are in different screens with loading wait times), no more little details that made the worlds seem like, well, real worlds. No more micro-managing resources and planning supply chains or careful map lay out. All that is gone. Now you just drop in farms as whole units. No more warehouses, all you need is a road. No more sea battles in the old sense, now it is a sperate battle screen that takes yuo completely out of the game. There is not one game's worth of play here let alone playing again and again and again like I have previous Anno versions. I've played and replayed Anno 2070 and others for YEARS. No more. Looks like I'm done with Anno. Yet another awesome PC game franchise killed.",

            "review_text": "TL;DR: Don't buy this now. Wait for sales / additional expansion(s) to play this game. There's no MP, so you won't lose any fun.  The game LOOKS gorgeous, but compared to previous installation (Anno 2070), there's so many elements that have been cut down from this game, such as:  - Skirmish, Multiplayer mode. You can only play Campaign. - Massive command ARK that you can personalize &amp; store items. - Events - Army. There's no army production or military buildings that you can build. Battle has been seperated into its own mission, away from the base building. And you can only use ships (not even submarines!). And you are stuck with 3 types of ship that you can upgrade (stats only, no visual difference). - AI Opponent. In any map, you're playing by yourself! There's no opponent AI, only some static trader AI.  - Random map. You will be playing on the same map on all playthroughs, 3 different map for each region type (Temperate, Arctic, Lunar) - Progression. You'll only unlock some achievement and some MINOR cosmetics for your command ship &amp; corporate logo. That's all. Unlike Anno 2070, where you can customize your Ark, get some rare components for stats upgrade in an island, etc. You will have nothing to do once you can build company HQ except for one-time achievements (in Anno 2070 you can continue playing to get some rare components) - Manual resource management. All items produced in a regions is calculated into a total automatically, unlike in Anno 2070 where you have to carefully adjust your trade routes and amounts. - No component research. You can't make some upgrade to boost your production / reduce maintenance of buildings in an island like Anno 2070.   Then there's some part that annoys me:  - The company HQ doesn't provide any benefits at all, but will need an insanely high maintenance (Credit, Power, Worker). - Building location for docks are fixed, as well as locations for mountain / coastal buildings. - Building modules for your buildings require special resource that can only be earned from missions / special map project. Really problematic in early game, but not at late game. And different for Temperate, Arctic, and Lunar regions. - Resources are shown in net rate, not amount. I can have surplus of +1 of Android (late-game resource) and 400 of it in storage, but I can only sell / transfer it in rate, not amount. - Amount of credit that you can hold is limited, based on your company level. - You will jump a lot between maps to adjust your production rate. It's very repititive and brainless, BORING! - Sector projects are almost only for getting achievement; once you're in late game, their bonuses are small compared to what you can make by yourself. Oh, and the ornamental projects are purely for some ornaments, not even a steady income. - Every new game will be the same. Same story, same maps, etc. It will only differ by the game settings that you picked. - There are some rival companies, but only for preventing you from buying additional regions. Once your level is above them, you can buy the regions they hold. Only that. No economy sabotage or any of the activitied that the AI used to do back in Anno 2070.   But, there are some parts that I like:  - Resource are counted in rate, so it's much easier to control resource production, especially one requiring many other resources. And it makes transfer to multiple regions much easier. - All special buildings for increasing population level as well as warehouses doesn't have radius, but instead provide a constant amount. This adds flexibility to building placement, as well as some realism where I have to build multiple of them in a small, dense population area. - Uniqueness of each region type. In arctic, you can only build resident places near factories, and in Lunar you need shield around everything.   Summary:  Clearly, Ubi wants much larger player base (= MOAR MONEY), and thus this game is streamlined as **** to almost pure pile of ****. There's no depth at all, no sense of progression, almost no online features, no opponents to challenge my company, trading with AI is almost useless, no military buildings, bland army, and some units are clearly reskin of unit models of Anno 2070.  Perhaps, Ubi is cutting down all those elements so they can charge them for additional $$ as DLCs (or expansions. Ubi &amp; EA name DLC as Expansion, as the term 'DLC' has such a bad rep because of them)  For me, this game is a 20$~30$ game that has really polished looks and animation. THIS GAME DOESN'T WORTH YOUR MONEY. And the saddest thing is that I pre-ordered the Gold Edition and can't refund because I spent hours trying to find additional depths to the game that I couldn't find. FML.",

Especially when I played Anno 2070 before and absolutely fell in love with it. There are so many good features in Anno 2070 have been removed in 2205. To me Anno 2070 is a 9.5/10. Anno 2205 is only 7.5/10. Here are a few things I believe the game missed:  1) Endless/ Skirmish mode: I just don't understand. In Anno 2070, you can customize your game, choose how many islands in the map, pick your opponents and all kind of other stuff. What did they do with all of these? There is actually a 'campaign section' in Anno 2070 with many different missions for you to try. What does Anno 2205 have? One single campaign. What the heck was that????  2) The RTS element: I love the RTS element in Anno 2070. You have to save every single bit of your income and material to build your ships. With your army, you can protect your city and trade routes. It all feels so meaningful. What have they done with that awesome system in Anno 2205? They separate it from the main City building game and what we have is a boring, repetitive mini game that I just refuse to do any more after a few mission.  3) Diplomacy: No more diplomacy, no more factions. All characters now basically serve the same function: Provide goods for trades and give you those boring missions over and over again. While in Anno 2070, every character is different and plays a very clear role. Hector was an annoying pirate who won't stop harassing your trading activities. Thor has a mighty army with him and can destroy you with ease. The oil guy, the scientist, the trader, they all serve a very unique purpose. The missions they gave you can have direct impact to your relationships. That awesome diplomacy system was wiped out completely in 2205. Now you are all alone.   4) No Multiplayer: I'm not a huge fan of multiplayer in Anno but some do. To me it's not a problem.  All in all the game just feel lack. I refuse to believe this is all they came up with after successfully making a game like Anno 2070. The only reason I gave this game a 7.5 is because of that awesome moment when you went to the moon and of course, the beautiful graphic and building design.",

Once a vibrant and well enjoyed series, Anno has hit it's lowest point with 2205. Dumbed down gameplay, microtransactions for resources, a Bejewled-esque partner app, and a season pass advertising specific DLC only weeks after release makes this latest Anno game a complete letdown. The most drastic changes that seasoned Anno fans will notice are: - Removal of interfaction combat, limiting combat to small prebuild NPC only quest maps. - Dumbing down gameplay mechanics and limiting player control over urban development - The addtion of special resources to spur development, only obtainable through Ubisoft Club interactions, a partner app game modeled after Bejewled (which will make any Anno player feel like a 12 year old) or through direct purchase. - Removal of the use of navies and boats, as they no longer serve a purpose - Removal of trade routes, transfer routes are now only used to transfer resources between owned maps - Removal of diplomacy options, having replaced diplomacy with a simple 'buy island' button - Removal of environmental effects, which provided a challenging and interesting mechanic in Anno 2070 - And many other features. All of these reasons contribute to an overall extremely unsatisfactory experience, and I cannot in good conscious recommend this game to ANYONE. ",

If you are looking for a city builder I could suggest this game to you, it looks beautiful and it can be fun at some points. It does, however, not have a lot of replayability after you have completed the campaign, which is basically the game now. And the price is very high (too high if you'd ask me!) compared to city skylines.  My rating for this game as for people who are looking for a city builder would be a 6/10 (give it a try if it's on sale, but  don't  buy it for a ridiculously high price!) My rating for this game as an Anno fan would be a 4/10 (worst in the Anno series by far)  I don't mind if the devs want to make some changes to the game so it doesn't stay the same, but these changes are not what I am looking for in an Anno game.

I appreciate when a series tries somthing new but in my opinion the devs went the wrong way. First, I couldn't really get my head around what it was, but the more I played, the more it got obvious, that all challenges were missing. The game is for sure nice, if you never played Anno before, but for me it's boring. I went back to Anno 1404 to get the differences and they are enormous.   - you can build whatever you want without any problems in 2055 while every other entry had restrictions which forced you to plan - all you do is to wait to get the numbers up  - the management of resources is gone - the 'campaign' doesn't has an interesting storyline  - it feels like the people are always happy even if you dismiss their needs - the whole buildings look even more generic than in 2070 - not much of exploring, trading and routes if at all.   I don't need or ever played MP, so this is nothing negative for me. The whole game simply doesn't feel right, it isn't even close to any Anno game in the series. I am not saying making it more casual is bad, but it got me bored in under 2 hours and I never touched it again.   It looks good, no question, but looks aren't everything, when the gameplay and/or story isn't getting me interested. If you loved any other Anno game, I can't recomend this one. If you're new to the series, give it a try if you want. For me, Anno 1404 is the best one and since it's only 10 Euros, it might be the better start into the series.",

Previous  Game is still pretty much an Anno game, with city building and resource management aspects of the game intact. There are three main zones (temperate, arctic and lunar) which corresponds to Ecos, Tycoon and Tech factions in Anno 2070. Gameplay is tweaked and streamlined such that resource management is straight forward plop-and-forget, unlike previous Anno where placement is more critical and planning is required. Trading is also streamlined but in hindsight regressed, with trading featured only between sectors (world). Within sectors, there is no need to move goods around islands as they are all interlinked.  However, at initial launch, the game lacks replayability and excitement that comes from random maps (almost all previous Annos), items (Anno 2070), exploration in that adds depth to the game. Maps are fixed (9 variants) and lack variety, and missions are very similar in nature with the same scripts across multiple play-through, unlike GTA or even other modern games where the scripts are varied. In particular, items are also totally stripped out, and there are no longer things that make your world unique such as ship equipment, ark upgrades, island-specific upgrades that makes the game exciting.",

It only lasted for about 10 hours of actual gameplay, nothing like enough for a game of this calibre and price. No replayability.  I am hopig that the DLCs will expand the game enough to make it worthy of the name. But for now, do not buy it.",

With major changess in item descriptions, to match current state extremely common thougough the shelf life of game, unfortunatelly - with all of them being originally imprecise, and implying further addons to be included - there's no chance I can really reccomend any game of this developer anywhen.  If you do however like anno series - it may be interesting game to play, however I'd reccomend thinking thrice before buying it without staggering discount.",

Check the last part for after 30+ play review.  As a seasoned Anno player I must say this game feels like a massive disappointment, the whole depth and substance of the game has been taken away. It's now a childrens playtime game, no real resource management, no real challenge, not even an interesting story line. It's just massive amounts of great graphics and that's it, nothing more.   It is so obvious this is another game made for not-so intelligent yet massively pampered and lousy millenial kids, you do trivial stuff and you get levels bonuses praises and crap, while there's not a real game going on, this game can be played after a real game as you let your mind to ease and eat dinner in front of the screen. It's that easy and crappy. THEY KILLED ANNO. Skip this one.  Let me summarize:  PROS:  + Easy interface + Great graphics  CONS: - No real strategy - Not much of a resource management - No real challenge - No storyline  ---------------------------------- At this point I tried to give the game a second chance since I gave so much money to this damn game and forced myself into its system, turns out they actually put some sort of resource management scheme, in the old games you'd manage the resources in between the islands of a single map, in this game you have to do it in between maps which means you have to wait for loadings and transition effects each time you visit a map location, they space bit is nice but not detailed, the other corporations dont even challenge you, the graphics engine is not optimized to you get damn frame rate falls, what else is out there ? What a bummer.",

Always nice to get back a bit in to the game, as it offers a great relaxation experience...also to switch off every now and then, running in the background as Im answering my work emails...  However I decided to give it a thumbs down, as the game now will sit idle in my Steam account until ( hopefully ) real challenging gameplay will be added in a year or two via DLC.  I would value the current gameplay value at $20 and not at the $70 I paid for the neat graphic content.",

And don't get me wrong I liked Sim City - it just doesnt work for Anno. This game is a giant failure. For fans of the series - stay away from it.  This game is a HUGE disapointment, already requested my refund. Thanks for wasting my time Ubisoft. ",

Second was definitely ANNO 2205.  Abandon SHIP!  old review: CANT PLACE TREES! MY METROPOLIS IS RUINED!!! (spent thousands of hours on ANNO series since 1602)  IMPRESSIONS AFTER 20 HOURS  First off, Uplay works fine.  Secondly, game needs content. ALOT of content. And a patch. ALOT of patches. Interface update specifically,new production buildings, more employee levels for lunar and arctic bases. Some kind of random element to maps. More sectors. Fix for the memory leak. Overhaul of the arbitrary quests system. (rare materials are practically worthless bcoz military missions yield u half a stack -&gt; always capped). Again, the interface!, it's been so dumbed down you practically dont get any info at all! Feels like a console game at times. Voice acting for major characters is disastrous, overall sound and ambience is top notch. No more scientific research? That used to be fun! Theres no incentive to continue playing after completing main objectives. I don't feel pressured or challenged anymore. I can just sit on my millions and look at the scenery. No-one is competing against me.  Game deserves 7/10 rating as of now. has GREAT potential though, and i'm under the impression it was designed with numerous expansions in mind. SO KEEP THEM ROLLING.  Still think its worth 60€ for an ANNOholic. Otherwise, wait for a sale or google a better deal. And/or wait for them expansions.  AFTER 50 HOURS  OCD is stronk with this one. Pretty much nothing else. Boring. All the same. No content, no challenge. Persistent annoying quests, crappy voice acting and bugs. Well. It certainly feels more like a beta version than a game we were supposed to sink 'thousands of hours' in. If youre a lil hardcore ure pretty much done in 20h with EVERYTHING game has to offer, literally. No replay value whatsoever. (you can rush thru the game in 3h btw, including 30 module HQ)   TL;DR: Honorable failure. Nice try. Decent 'beta'. Now give us the real deal please!",

Once you get yourself to all areas though it's just the same, over and over and over. I can't get a refund cause I've played it to long but I can't see myself returning to this unless the dlc's make some spectacular changes.
