            "review_text": "I really loved the idea. I missed a game with 'Pimp my Gun' style. But this game is awful, let me tell you why:  First (as a IPSC shooter experience) you don't weld barrel with the receiver, stocks and sights. Most of the gun part is assembled not welded, so you can clean and mantain the weapon. I could let it go if it was a wrench instead of a welder.  Second, and this is why i didin't recomend this, the controls are awful. You press 'E' to pick and drop a weapon and it works sometimes and when works, it's when you're not intended to do it.  The final nail in the coffin was when i gathered money to buy a stock, i picked it up and tried to assemble in the bench, but instead he picked up the weapon (and dropped the stock on the floor). So i tried to place the weapon in the bench and he dropped the weapon and (get this) fell in the floor right where the stock was. And when that happened the stock disappeared on the floor. I just lost the equipment and the money.  So ok, i decided to let this pass and tried to go to the shooting range to get more money tobuy another stock (my balance was $1), so i picked the weapon (with some difficulty) and went to the door and pressed 'e' to go to the range. Now the thing gets fun: Instead to go to the range he dropped the weapon and it got stuck in the door and dissapeared!  And guess what? I have no money, no weapon, and i can't get more money to build another weapon because i don't have any to go to the range. So now every time i boot the game up i spawn in the workshop with empty bench and no money. Thank dev...  If this game get more polished and clean the bugs out, i'm sure i'll give a good mark. But for now, avoid this game.",

Pros +Has potential to be very intresting  Cons -Can loose guns in the wall -Sometimes guns will not shoot -Sometimes welder does not work -Start with very low money and can not do much -Can't seem to add silencers to guns -Accuracy is horrible no matter what you do -Very limited selection of items -It was laggy for me, even though im running it on a gaming computer -The list of Cons goes on, while the pros are short and barely exist.  so far it will be a 1/10. I just can not stand to play it in its current condition.",

Unfortunately the developers trashed away this game and abandoned it, leaving it filled with bugs and in 'beta' state however it's more like pre-alpha. Only buy this if you're planned to play it for a quick 10-minute trashy YouTube video and then refund.",

It would be nice if you could sell your weapon to a ... Market and get money. I saw some tools in the room what are not interactive, this is bad. It needs a tutorial and also needs low-cost starting items (like these on the bookshelf). I really liked the game idea, it's original and shiny. Sometimes I lite this type of games more than the popular ones. You only need to be lucky and find them on market. Unfortunately everywhere on the market is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t",

There's no precision*' 10th minute: 'I earned 20$ in 20 seconds for shooting some bullets in the air since i couldn't hit the targets.

This isn't a game, this is just something made by someone who wanted to earn money without having to put any effort in this. Could've been a good idea if the purpose of this game wasn't just the profit. Do NOT Buy this game. I played for 10 minutes, wasted them and now I feel like ♥♥♥♥.",

But really buggy and overall if you dont have patience DONT BUY IT glitchs that are with the gun 1. make a button on the menu that says 'RETURN GUN TO HOME' Please! It would bring the gun back to the workshop and i dont have to deal with having to make a gun again after dropping a really good one magically through the door. 2. make faster sprinting! i dont want to have to deal with 15 seconds of running around the room using the sprint button! 3.i haven't come across more glitchs but i will update the review if i do. Please developers. I really do not like acidently dropping my good weapon through the door trying to go into the practice range. so fix this!  nice suggestions: Make a kind of story mode with people?  Could you make the back door openable and make some pedestrians shootable? make a explorable area (in the apartment, etleast)",

Only one receiver available, not much gameplay. mediocre amount of parts with the same 4 models, different prices &amp; stats.  You can't upgrade weapons once you attach the parts, i.e buying a $70 barrel, getting money and buying a $300 one, that you cant replace.  Rock music constantly playing in a loop, 2 levels &amp; they're both super bland &amp; uninteresting.   3/10 - I got a kick from making fun of the game - Beta V2 is a myth - Developer nowhere to be seen, probably abandoned the game",

            "review_text": "This game is AWESOME. Love how you can build your own guns, shoot them &amp; modify them!  Pros:   - Quite unique. I haven't seen any other weapon-builder PC games.  - Modular. You don't buy guns as a whole, you build them.  - Choice of music. Music could be annoying, but since it's not crappy pop music, I'll give it a plus.  Cons:  - VERY Buggy. See bottom of review!  - Unity? Props for creating this, but doing games from scratch is harder. When I see that Unity loading screen, I think the game might be bad. (Although, this was false haha)  --------------------------------------------------------  Bugs:  - Pressing E on the training door only works in certain positions.  I had my awesome gun, spent about $5k on it. It said 'Press E to enter training', I did so, and I dropped my weapon. I dropped it out of the door, and there was no way to retrieve it. I tried exiting to main menu and loading in again, it was in the same place.   - Physics can be pretty bad. Sometimes, they limit what you can do.   - Silencers don't fit on all barrels. I can understand this in real life, but I think this is actually a bug. I bought a cheap silencer and couldn't put it on because the blue draw on the gun desk was in the way / couldn't fit on the barrel.   - Pressing E on the gun desk doesn't always place it, sometimes it drops it under the desk and you have to start all over again because it won't let you pick your weapon up.   - Running / walking is absurd. Slow, bouncy, etc.   - The reload sound goes longer than the actual reload. I can shoot around the end of the sound.  --------------------------------------------------  Ways around bugs / suggestions:   - Make pressing 'SHIFT + E' on something work from any range.  - On the market, put a warning on barrels that don't allow silencers below the price in red: 'Doesn't allow silencers.'  - Make walking smooth without what's causing it to look like a chicken that's bhopping.  Suggestions:   - A use for the anvil.  - Reload button refreshes the market. Right now, it doesn't do anything.  - Mail button doesn't do anything. I don't know what it's for, but eh.  - Able to texture parts or change the material before you buy it. Buying a wooden barrel on a metal gun doesn't look the best.  - OTHER WAYS TO MAKE MONEY! Shooting a gun at training isn't the best way to make money. What about trading guns and etc? That's be awesome.  - Muzzles  - More magazines. Drums, etc  - More designs for different parts. There are only a few models for different ranges of the same part type.  -----------------------------  Thanks for the game, loving it. Bug fixes and added suggestions would be top-notch.",
