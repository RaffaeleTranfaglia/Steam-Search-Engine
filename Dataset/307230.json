It is 2D game, you are zombie, you are outnumbered by civilians and soldiers. Your goal is to convince everyone to become zombie, usually by biting. Civilians are cowards, so they just run, but soldiers are brave and they have guns. You have to be smart and always try to outnumber your enemies. You can give simple orders to your small zombie army and develop new tactics. Game is simple, but enjoyable, graphic and music are ok - it is indie production after all. Flaws? Yes, it's too short and I want it on my Lumia!  Best regards and have fun!",

I recommend this game, as of now, it's cheap and definitely worth it. The controls work really well.  Infect more people to control more people. Move them around the map, make them stop to guard a place or fend off scared civillians - or just press 'A' and make them go fry nut crazy and kill everything in their path. Until they die because they're shot down. But then they're functioning as your distraction, so you can attack from behind.",

We've seen Blaine commit no small number of horrific acts, yet Anders continues to make the zombie likable. Charming, even. He tortured Major but did so with such swagger and confidence that it didn't feel like torture. Yet, it was still apparent Major was in real danger. It takes skill from the writers and Anders to make Blaine's personality believable without getting ridiculous, and they've pulled it off all season.  Blaine's and Major's arcs stole the season finale. Especially Major. His development has taken the most surprising course over the season, and I'm nothing but impressed with how they transformed the quiet, super nice guy into a zombie killer. It's not an easy change to make believable, but they dug in around the edges just the right amount before plunging the shovel in and sold it. Major even committed to his mission and went back to Meat Cute when he could have ran away. Again, I was caught off guard because he didn't hold back (the choice of music for the sequence, After the Fire's version of 'Der Kommissar', was spot on). Him being unaware was disappointing though -- it was awfully convenient for him not to notice Blaine.  But, the arc wrapped up well for both characters and in unexpected ways. Liv giving Blaine the cure rather than killing him was a relief because it's way too soon for Anders to leave the show, and Liv turning Major back (hopefully) was a compassionate turn. The balance of the ways she used the two doses of the cure -- with hate and with love -- was a wonderful touch. This was the most emotional we've seen her. It makes sense. Things have only gone downhill since Lowell died. She's wrecked and by the time she got to talk to Major after she turned him, you could practically see her heart on her sleeve. Rose McIver played it understated and quietly but that made it so powerful.",

It's a easy concept and something that is clearly decided to just be picked up and learned without thought. They do add harder elements in later levels though. Though there aren't many good things other then the concept and easy controls here. The game is short and can be beaten rather quickly. It isn't really even made for long plays as after maybe 15 minutes you'll find you don't have the urge to continue. When controlling your character around corners and walls I often found that you were slowed down rather dramatically for no reason. Worse of all though is the unfair AI who can go from simple to overly difficult if even enemies with guns and a big field of vision. One you are being shot you slow down and your health quickly goes making a lot of deaths happen in a frustrating manner.

Those levels were often more frustrating than fun since precise movement is difficult (you can get caught on obstacles very easily) and you lack direct control over the other individual zombies.  Overall, a very inexpensive way to enjoy a couple hours, but the end game can be frustrating.",

The game starts off really simple but gets much harder very quickly. Some levels appear fairly simple in theory but in practice they're quite a bit more difficult as they rely on very tight timing.  Here are a few things I really liked about this:  - The zombies are very cute and you really do feel bad when you accidentally let them die. - There were a few levels with different objectives thrown into the mix and it provided a nice change. - I LOVE the music. Great combination of jaunty and slightly creepy. The perfect fit for your pint-sized zombie minions.",
