            "review_text": "Pro: Minimal System Specs Tutorial is useful In theory it's fun ... if you like FPS games Most of the keys can be remapped Single player   Con: $10 for a game that should be $2 (tops) Dated graphics that fit nicely with the sub-par story line. Cannot screen capture, no cards, etc. Limited graphics options Controls are not good (not percise) Reallllly needs multi-player or Co-Op. Then the game may be fun.   Overall: 5/10 -1 for controls, -1 for price, -1 for story, +1 for system specs = 3/10 (Get when on sale for 90% + off)  This is not a good game. It's not bad either. It's just a dated, overpriced ho hum FPS. Save your money and get a new game if your into FPSers. If you can get it for under $2 or in a bundle, give it a try. Otherwise just play something else on steam.",

Although the story is forgetable and the characters are too, I mean seriously instead of their 'Badass' names I called them Sterotypical white action man and Sterotypical white stealth man or actiony and stealthy for short, it was pretty alright gameplay and AI thats not the best but becomes really fun because of that. The controls are...odd to say the least luckily you can remap them and I advise you do although keep track which button is which as you may need to use something thats remapped to something else. All in all it's a fun game especially for 2005 if you're bored and you have the time and money get this game its not the best but certainly not the worst.",

So, when I found , that this game is on Steam, nostalgia just punched me right in the face.  Maybe this game is old,compared to the newer ones, maybe it isn't as realistic as other games,but still - it's hell of a fun. Just running around and shooting everyone you see can entertain you for some time. So, I recommend people to play this game - it's really fun.",
