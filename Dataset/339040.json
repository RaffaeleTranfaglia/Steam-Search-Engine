This game always ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off, especially the parts of the Goosey Chase and such, as I remember I would always screw up on them and yell at the screen while having a tantrum, trying to break the controller. Good memories...   Otherwise, don't listen to the negative report since it's a stupid reason to dislike, a simple error he only pointed out and it's easy to fix. Yeah, it's not a perfect port, but it works. No game is perfect.   Get this game if you had it in your childhood, it's sure nostalgic.",

All perfectly put together to create one game that is often overlooked as being an 'average movie tie-in for an average movie'.  For the sequel: -VR -More Barenaked Ladies -More Fish -More Dodgeball -More Driving (free-roam world perhaps??) -More Baseball -More collecting items -More weapons",
