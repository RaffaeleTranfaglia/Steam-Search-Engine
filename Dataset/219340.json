            "review_text": "So you put together a team of viking and giant warriors and fight short tactical turnbased fights and tournaments to get renown, wich is used to buy more space for warriors or upgrade your warriors. You get matched against players with the same combined level of fighters, resulting in very even matches. The combat system is identical to the banner saga, with the only exception of some small changes to the abilities of some units.  Though I strongly recommend the game, there are some issues that you should know before playing.  First of all it is a player vs player only game. There is no training mode or single player, if you want that you have to buy The banner Saga (strongly recommended as well).  The second major issue is that the game seems kind of forgotten by the developers, there are memory leak issues that cause lag, and updates are close to nonexistent.   The third issue is that most player quit due to the first two, or the fact that the gameplay changes very little over time, resulting in very few players online at any moment. This of course can cause painfully long periods of waiting for a match. This is also to some extent caused by the matching system, in wich you may be unable to battle anyone at all if you don't have enough warriors to put together teams of different levels (ironically happens predominantly to new players).  With those things out of the way, this is really fun and challenging game for you tactics fans. The turn system is different from many other games and is of extreme tactical importance, and to me the number of classes and restrictions are enough for a large umber of tactics and combos.   Adressing the issues: The first becomes a non-issue after like four fights. The community is great and everyone are excited for new players and will help you get started.  The second issue is bad, but in theory if more people play it the devs should work more to upgrade it. It will also likely get a boost after the release of newly announced TBS2.  The third issue is the hard one. I personally don't think its boring, just as I dont think chess is boring, even if chess hasnt got any upgrades or new skins for decades =). And remember that many quit because there are too few players already. what kind of logic is that? But I won't judge anyone who played the game for a year and a half, waiting for someone to fix the lag and crash issues, and stopped playing when nothing happened.  Try it out though. it's Free! and fun!",

            "review_text": "This game has sucked up more of my life then any other game of Steam to date and with good reason. Essentially a complex version of chess, this game became my obsession for a good six months. While the servers are not nearly as busy as they were during its hayday, the game is still a superb demonstration of how to develop a rich deep combat turn-based combat system with high replay value. Add to that some of the most beautiful hand drawn artwork I have seen since Monkey Island 3 and you have a winner. For those looking for a better single player, offline experience, I recommend the single player game that was the catalyst for this, The Banner Saga (and hopefully soon) its sequel, The Banner Saga 2.",

If/when they clean this up it is definitely worth the download. I would not put any actual money into it though, such as the pay to customize your pieces. This is online dueling only, I do recommend buying the separate single player game when it's on sale. There'd be a much bigger community if this game ran smoothly, but right now it's one of the worst performing games I've ever played, and the community is nice but very small. You'll probably be held back unable to use your upgraded pieces because you won't find a match at the higher tiers. Rated matches use the ELO scoring method and an average match is 15 minutes long, but the game isn't stable enough to move up in ranked matches so I mostly played quick matches (same thing but without the score).",

That is the biggest problem with this game is that it is only multiplayer, and it is difficult to get a match which is pretty much a cardinal sin for a multiplayer only game.",

WTF). When you start out, it is almost impossible to find a match - literally impossible. You'll get stuck in a cycle where you need a certain level of power to play in ranked or tournaments but since you can't find a quick match there is no way to level up - only PvP is available so quick match is the only way to level up at the start. I have played the game for about 4 hours (90% of the time wasted looking for a quick match) and I have only fought 4 matches - fyi, a single match takes about 10-15 minutes max. This game is literally unplayable... It might say free to play, but logically, due to how impossible it is to level up to a decent power level to even being able to find a match is, it requires you to pay for one of the start packs or something - and even then you aren't even guaranteed to even being able to find a match.  Final Verdict: The game is unplayable. I would say try it out, but you might spend over 30 minutes trying to find a match - making even a demo of the game impossible. Don't forget, the game play is true to the original, but the online implementation is what makes this game unplayable. Finally and most importantly, if the devs have given up... then you shouldn't even consider it. PASS.",
