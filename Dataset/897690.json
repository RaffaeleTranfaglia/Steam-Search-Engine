    "recommended_requirements": "OS: Windows 10 Processor: Intel i5-4590 / AMD Ryzen 5 1500X or greater Memory: 16 GB RAM Graphics: NVIDIA GTX 1060 / AMD Radeon RX 480 or greater Storage: 501 MB available space Sound Card: If I were better at making sounds I bet a sound card could really open up potential for an amazing sounding VR game. But I'm not better, so that's that I guess. Additional Notes: You are braver than you believe, stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think.",
