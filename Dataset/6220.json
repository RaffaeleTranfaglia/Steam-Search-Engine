            "review_text": "While this game is very fun, it does have it fair share of problems. In some ways it feels a bit dated, but at the same time it holds up quite well. Which is not that surprising for a game that came out in 2005.   The controls really make and break this game. They are very floaty and extremely clunky. It basically feel like you're controlling a jetski in rough waters. When on tarmac, it feels good. You can drift around corners and speed through light curves and it feels like a great arcade racer. When you drive on snow and off-road on the other hand, you're sliding all over the place and have little to no control. Almost slowing down completely before big corners in order to handle them. And the AI cars will drift through like zen masters.  Which is another problem with this game. The AI. There's not much rubberbanding in this game. If one of the AI cars end up ahead of the pack, then their perfect path finding will leave you in the dust. You can never catch up. I had the fastest car with all upgrades, and they still sped ahead of me. This game is about crashing your opponents to get ahead, and then keep the lead. And if you crash yourself, you're forced to a 4 second slow-mo crash sequence, and when it ends you're put back quite a while. Usually last place. There's also a reset button. It works when prompted, and some other times as well. When you've been pushed off track and facing the wrong way though, it will most likely not work. You don't decide when to reset, Flatout does.   But when it all comes together (usually the tarmac tracks) this game is incredibly fun. But the other aggravations kept me from finishing this game. I beat the bronze and silver tracks, but I had to give up at the gold tracks. After resetting a track 20 times because the AI kept using the PIT maneuver to turn me the wrong way, I gave up. That's where the fun ended for me. But for the price and for the hours I put in, I can't complain. I will recommend this game, but be aware that it definitely has its shortcomings. But then again, it's also a 9 year old game.",

ALL of this was on the ps2, this is what a true 'stupid fun' game should be  oh and on a side note, Next Car Game is made by the same people that made this.",

            "review_text": "Ah yes, FlatOut, A game I fondly remember from my childhood, back on the PS2.  This game is actually pretty fun, the soundtrack is great, the cars are nice, the racing is challenging and fast, all the cars look pretty great and each have their own characteristics to the way they drive and perform. Theres also a good amount of added gamemodes, like Destruction derby, highjump, bowling, and the added derply like tracks, like the oval and Figure 8 tracks.   Pros:   Not demanding, runs well.  Graphics still hold up even today, and look pretty good for their time.  Great soundtrack overall, aside from maybe 1 or 2 songs that are just 'Eh..'  Driving feels crisp and responsive, though some of the bronse class cars can feel a bit floaty  Great sense of speed.  Multiple gamemodes, all of which are pretty fun and entertaining  Entire tracks are all fully modeled and explorable with destructable bits included, a feature sadly removed from Flatout 2.   Cons:   A minor flaw-,Soundracks repeat during racing, and the playlist only changed to another song if you reastart the event or go to another one.  Some objects are badly placed on tracks, like excavators,trucks,tractors ect all being placed in bad areas, wich can cause unneeded or undeserved wrecks, it also makes it harder to get a good driving line through certain corners. Sometimes even the tinest of objects like cones, can cause huge wrecks too.   (Continued) I was in a gold class race, second to last lap on Fairgrass Challenge, when i ran over a cone on a turn. This cone caused my car to roll, then cartwheel 16 times, so farr off the track tthat I smacked the semi-invisible wall marking the end of the map, flew out of my car, and had to restart the race. A Tiny cone, was enough to ruin a whole race for me, stuff like this is very frustrating, but, minor.  Some of the Shortcuts on certain tracks are totally useless, and generally will result in a wreck, or making you take longer to do a lap.    Overall though, its a whole lot of fun, and pretty Solid, woth the cheap asking price in my opinion.",

Developed by Bugbear Entertainment, FlatOut is the first game in the FlatOut series.  It's Finnish made, I'm Finnish myself. Flatout came out for a big surprise. No-one hasn't seen an awesome car game like this in 2004-2005.  If you want to buy an amazing car game for really cheap, I present you: FlatOut.",

            "review_text": "This feels like an internal beta version of a game meant to show to publishers or something and not an actual released game. You have alot of abruptness and big text to read and not a whole lot of content. You don't have to think at all when purchasing upgrades just buy the ones there you can afford and move on. Physics don't seem quite right as items that you would expect to fly right through either collide with you and can throw your car off track or just completely stop you with friction. The music is pretty bad and sounds like they tried to make a song that kinda sounded like a good popular song but failed with every attempt. Vocals are strangely quite and hard to hear over the gameplay if you can at all.  The actual racing is pretty boring. Its a basic arcade racing game. Nothing special. Once you get so far infront of the AI drivers they dont really catch up unless you slow down. They don't seem to take short cuts or really know how to drive very well either. Nothing really links one race to another either, I feel no reason to keep playing the game and no real impetus to beat another race.  What is 'special' about the game is that if you crash hard enough your driver can be tossed out the window and your care can take visual damage to specific areas. The cars are modeled decently well detailed so this can look pretty neat. But in reality getting tossed out of the car (which for some reason makes the game chug whenver it happens on my system) is really ♥♥♥♥ing annoying and I just sit there nailing the reset button. Its one of those games where resetting and starting from a dead stop further back is faster than trying to un♥♥♥♥ yourself out of whatever wreck you got in.  Its just a boring and generic racing game though.  Its not really 'bad' just baseline. Its kinda like a cheap chinese knockoff of a branded item where the knockoff does its job, but it just does it good enough. Its pretty obvious to me Flatout atleast started as an attempt to cash in off of the Burnout series popularity. Atleast thats my theory. I havn't played any other Flatout game to date or the older Burnout titles though.",

The gameplay on tarmac is too easy vs AI if you get ahead of them in comparison to off-road, and the camera is too slow to keep up to show you what's ahead when rounding a corner. There are noob traps, and while paused to use the Steam overlay it will often unpause itself if you try typing to friends. The worst thing is the AI ruining your race, trapping you or pushing you into solid things or spinning you round with more powerful cars.",
