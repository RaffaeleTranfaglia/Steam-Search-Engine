            "review_text": "When I first played Don't Starve, one thing that I kept thinking was - I wish I could share this with my friends... and finally, I can. The multiplayer experience is amazing - especially with a friend that you can talk to on some kind of voice chat. The Don't Starve world translates very nicely to co-operative play, but since I haven't tried PvP I can't comment on what that's like at all.   Out of the three friends I've played with, two ended up finding Don't Starve too stressful. Something about how there's too much to keep track on at once, and the constant scrounging for survival became too much like work. In the game's defence, this was during early beta, and they weren't Don't Starve players to begin with, but I think there's something to it. Don't Starve demands that you're quick on your feet and able to multitask to some degree. It can get pretty hectic and there's not any time to stand around to gather your thoughts. It's something to keep in mind if you prefer games that can be paused or where you can spend a lot of time weighing your options.  Me, I feel like I've found the game for the very first time, all over again. The stuff I loved finding on my own is twice as fun to encounter with someone else by my side. There's a bit lost in atmosphere because you're no longer so devastatingly ALONE, and things are less creepy... but that small loss is made up for with a new unpredictability. Today, for instance, I was happily foraging for berries when my friend started shrieking that the trees had grown tentacles and were giving birth to some freaky baby trees. A well-planned day suddenly became a mad scramble for survival.",

            "review_text": "First off, buy the game! Its $13 for 2 copies (at the moment)  Im 7 hours in (2 days in real life) and its been a blast. Creating a random generated world thats completely different from the last screw up with my friends. You explore and survive slowly and take it day by day by season. Nights get longer and colder then warmer. You evolve yourself and base and explore further into the random generated map which at this point seems endless! We havent even scraped the top of what there is to explore in the game, but hands down seems to be one of the if not the best survival game to date imo!  Its crafting, its mining, its hunting and the simplicity of the game from a 2d cartoon perspective is just mindblowingly fun.  I highly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys exploring, surviving and or wants to hang out with their buddies for what seems to be one hell of a challenge!   Lets not forget you can play multiple characters and get different types of clothing to wear!  The game is smooth, no bugs (that i have found currently) and is overwhelmingly exciting to run into the spooky darkness just to find something.  Recap:  Buy it!  10/10 would recommend to all my friends again.",

Without any other weapons or the resources required to make them, Wilson made a torch, then proceeded to light the Bearger on fire, at which point Bearger immediately flailed around on a rampage, finishing Wilson off by trampling him, and then instantly destroying or setting fire to every single building in Wilson's base.

            "review_text": "One of the best games I ever played. 9/10  The game itself has a challenging yet adequate learning curve and plenty of content to discover. Overall the community is friendly and inclusive, definitely best played with friends.  The first few games feel like everything is out to kill you (because it is), and you get a nice adrenaline kick just from frantically trying to survive and loads of laughs as you die in the most unimaginable ways. As you get more experienced and basic survival is no longer a challenge (took me about 30 hours for the novelty of survival to wear off), you'll start planning a bit further and preparing for each season's harsh climate conditions and bosses.   This is when the real game starts and the importance of long term planning, working well with others and managing time and resources effectively become more obvious. It's no longer a matter of surviving, it's a matter of doing it in the most ingenious way possible by combining and interacting the different elements of the game.   e.g.: Frog rain in spring? Certain death for some, free food for others.  Even when you are familiar with the above ground map's climate conditions, biomes, mobs and resources, there is still a lower level (Caves) to explore, which adds an extra layer of complexity and adventure to the game.   As if these incredibly addictive and time consuming aspects of the game weren't enough, there's yet another level which I am just starting to explore which are the Ruins of which I've only seen a couple of mobs and resources despite having played for over 200 hours.  The only thing that I believe can be improved (hence the 9/10 rating) is that other than autumn, all other seasons can be quite un-welcoming to both new and experienced players alike, so you're much more likely to (be left to) die when joining a server during winter or summer.  My favourite aspect of DST, is that it delivers these challenging mechanics and interactions through hilarious visuals and dark sarcasm, which will inevitably make you laugh even in the most difficult situations.",

The whole game deliberately looks very pop-up-book-ish with a polished cartoon sketch feel. It doesn't take itself too seriously and it really is just damn good fun to play. The modding community is also pretty active and you're quite free to do whatever you want with your own servers.  [I haven't tried myself but I imagine this would actually be a fun introduction to LUA programming if you want to get in on the modding action]  So, yes. If you like sitting on the couch and having a good 2, 3 or 6 player survival romp then this is your go-to. I recommend a bigger couch for 6 players, or friends with a good sense of personal hygiene and no sense of personal space.  11 out of 5 stars. Absolutely recommended.",

Like a real marriage, but with lots of weird, moody pets and no life insurance. It was love at first sight and our favorite multiplayer experience so far.  It includes all of the original game's DLC (except Shipwrecked). That means all the crafting, the fighting and the conflict is here, only now it's a shared experience. Play with friends in your local network or against Steam members from all over the world. If you want, you can still play alone as well, but why would you?  While Klei didn't get around to making achievements for it, which I would've liked, they've managed to get me addicted with the game's skin drops. Collecting clothes, trading them and personalizing my character suddenly became just as important as keeping it alive.  Need another reason to play Don't Starve Together? When you buy one, you get a free copy for a friend! Even better, if you owned the original before Don't Starve Together was released, like I did, you may already own it for free!

It adds features unique to itself while also keeping to the same formula as the original game.  The style of the game is visually beautiful and has a very Tim Burtonesque feel to it, which if you enjoy alternative styles or even those movies, you'll really be able to appreciate the visuals of this game. As well as that it's soundtrack is unique in the respect the music of it is primarily swing and oldies. Things such as the shadows and creepy atmophere can get very tense and eerie, so it's definitely much more fun to play with others. Allowing yourself to both share in the difficulty and creepy nature of the game.  I definitely recommend this game to anyone, who has little experience with survival games or even experienced players, it's a refreshing take on the genre and definitely keeps you glued to the game play for hours on end discovering new things about game, enjoying updated content and allowing you to face new difficulties each time with the randomly generated worlds.",

The game is simple in design compared to other games I've play yet, there is so much to do with it. The survival aspect is wondrfully done. The darkness and enemies gets me on my toes everytime because if I dont 'play my cards right', I would die and lose everything. The enivorment reacts wonderfully as it would in real life - overheating/freezing depending on the season and/or location, growth of plants overtime, rain make everything in inventory slippery, hail hurts, etc.  But we're not here to talk about the solo version of the game, we're here to talk about the co-op version: Don't Starve Together. Right off the bat based on observation: enemies are harder to kill - it actually promotes teamwork to take down enemies, it reflect real-life to some sense such as unable to know where your friends have gone after some distance between, players can either work together or fight among each other to survive, etc. Only issue of this game is that unless the host of the server is on, players (friends) cant go in and out of the said server to help each other or prep things while the host is offline. Other than that, it is quite a challenge to survive in this game and when alone, you will not survive...",

It sucks that you can only get four per week, though, no matter how many hours you play it. The skins servers reset every Thursday around 1 PM, so don't plan on idling or godmodding to try and get skin drops when you've reached the max you can get (which is, again, only four).  There's a mode you can play where you don't lose all your progress when you die, given you remember where you died so you can retrieve all your stuff and somebody hasn't already stolen it.

If your friends are used to delegating and taking charge its easy to feel like a third wheel while they build a fort or base and you sit around upgrading your own tools because they are in controll enough. The worlds I think are randomly generated and there are all sorts of different enemies and environments that spawn everywhere varying the world making things pretty random. And while I'm on the topic of randomness there is quite a bit that isn't really explained that can become easy trial and error deaths. Some playthroughs seem boring while in others you might meet a giant that will mess up all your hard work in seconds.   Artwise this game is decent, it looks like a Tim Burton movie and despite being kind of simple the art is endearing and full of personality. Music is more or less forgettable and I'm the kind of person to download lots of video game tracks. All in all the game can be lacking in things to do sometimes or at least in your first couple playthroughs but the great mod support this game has really saves it from being something you'll never touch twice.",

I had a campfire, tent, a berry farm for spring, alchemy lab, 5 drying racks and a trap line going for rabbits. I was almost through the winter and the days were starting to get a little longer, supplies were lean though. Still I thought if I can push on a few more days spring should be just around the bend. Then came a noise in the dark, a loud deep roar. I prepared my spear for whatever was comming and a torch in case I needed to bug out. From the darkness a massive monster came stomping into my camp, I ran and almost forgot to light my torch. As I fled into the savanna the last thing I saw was my tent being torn to the ground by the beast. I camped in the savanna and survived the cold by lighting grass nubs on fire. When I returned to camp in the morning nothing remained but the drying racks. I spent a night camping out in the woods chopping trees and collecting rocks from the nearby quarry to rebuild, and started to piece together a humble camp the next morning.   The night after the hounds came, Abigail was summoned, the hounds slain and I thought my luck was finally turning around. But then the noise came again from the darkness. With Abigail at my side I thought I may as well try to stave off the beast. Abigail fell, and I fled once again. Finally as I returned to my camp the next morning on the verge of insanity and death the beast attacked using a wave of ice and ending my life.  Wendy Days: 33 Cause of death: Deerclops Lesson Learned: Your camp is never safe, keep a bug out bag at all times in order to reestablish quickly. I give this game 10/10 ",

Characters re-balanced for multiplayer so that everyone is on relatively equal footing when it comes to screwing over their compatriots for resources.  Pros: Alien world occupied with fascinating creatures and occult treasures. Striking style conveyed through the game's unique art, music and presentation. Active mod community with mods easily incorporated via the Steam workshop. Special encounters amped up to compensate for increased number of players, challenging groups with more of the giants and other beasties that seek to undo all your hard work.  Cons: Brutal, rogue-like gameplay which can be discouraging to those who don't like having all their progress reset from time to time. Some content in the single player game missing from the multiplayer game. Slow game, requiring a considerable time investment to fully appreciate.  Would Recommend To: Fans of 'Don't Starve.' Fans of rogue-like survival games. Fans of games that involve exploring alien landscapes. Anyone who digs the art style in the screen caps.",

The world management system seems much better and more in-depth than the one available in regular don't starve. Also, this seems to bring together the various parts of DS like RoG under one roof, which is nice. It makes the experience of playing more clean and fluid.  There's item drops, trading and crafting. That's not my favourite thing, but it offers deeper character customization than just picking who you play as.  A nice touch with the multiplayer is that it offers a range of play setups, from single player mode, to LAN to WAN. Unfortunately, it does require you to go through the process of making a separate multiplayer login account, which is rather tedious, and seems redundant given that the game has steam integration.  But overall, DST is a nice experience, and definitely pulls together the DS experience for multiplayer.",

You can build a base after so much time scavenging for rare resources which can take you quite a long time and someone will wreck it just because he can leaving you with nothing. And this does happen quite often and there are no server settings that would prevent griefers from doing this.  I myself will stay away from this game because it has gotten a bit ridiculous but for the game itself I will still give this game a thumbs up because it is a great game it is just the community that is quite terrible and full of griefers.",

It is a gem and the developers know that, they give it huge expansions every month or two, heck it got one just yesterday. Its a simple concept but it is done so well, when you start the game you end up in the middle of nowhere with just one goal to begin with, survive the first night. You could use countless methods to survive the first night, let me list some: stand next to a burning tree all night, die and put yourself out of missery, build a campfire, hide out in a cave next to a bioluminesent plant, or if you're lucky then you could build a firepit on the first night. To get to those options you need to build an axe and collect some wood, the first day is easy, but its also the most restrictive. Any other day could be used for your own unique way of survival. One of my most enjoyable runs was when me and some friends set up an outpost near a herd of Beefalo some rabbits and a nest of spiders. We set up drying racks and built pens for the Beefalo in order to dry the rabbits for food, use the Beefalo poop for fire fuel and spider string and Beefalo Fur for clothing. We made it through winter but died because my friend that was new to the game tried to kill the spider nest so we ended up dying to the combination of Beefalo in mating season and a giant wrath of spiders and their queen. There are a million ways that you can survive, you never run out.

It's pretty easy to learn how to play this game, but very hard to master. It has a lot of replayable value since you can survive for endless days. What i loved most about this game is the community is pretty helpful to beginners and i had a blast playing on public servers. Even if you don't feel like interacting with other players and want to see whether you can actually survive alone, you can play it offline. Now, the downsides, you can actually trick the game into surviving more. I did this by closing my server whenever i saw that someone was close to dying, as long as the game isn't saved after completing a day all progress is reversed to the previous day. Another thing that i felt that made the game less enjoyable is it's nature of making you go through all the basic things everytime you start a game. It's fun and challenging at first but gets annoying as you get more grips on the game and the painstaking task of collecting the basic necessities everytime you start a new game can be painful.  But in all it's a solid game, would probably give it a 9/10. Would definitely recommend.",

To balance out the fact that players can now team on creatures, several entities have been modified for more health. It's a good balance, but if a player does not have many teammates, it can be hard. However, the game has resulted in several servers and mass following. In short; the game is great. The gameplay is understandable and unique at the same time, a tactic several games can not pull off. This proves finally that the game was wonderfully crafted. The only major problem was bad connectivity, which does not matter that much, as several multiplayer games have the same problem.

The game comes with an extra copy already so it's a great deal!   The game modes can be customized to your liking to make it easier or much, much harder.   Best of luck and Don't Starve!

I light a tree on fire and I start getting burned unless I move away.  What is the point of some of the items? The cartographer's table is pretty much useless... The lag sucks!

Nah, seriously:  Pro's: - Don't Starve, but multiplayer - Harder, but not only that, there also are people who make it even more harder by simply raiding your fridge daily; - Reign of giants DLC is in the game for free(?). - Caves! - Never gets boring, just because other players most of the time like to ruin your day, making you always struggling for life, making it hard to get to the point where it's just too easy, even if they don't, you can have a good time with them. - Mods, lots of mods, even though not perfect, they most of the time get updated and kept bug-free, allowing you to customise your  game  server however you want. - Same big freedom to customise the world as in Don't Starve, in conjuction with mods allowing you to make difficulty too easy for babies to handle or too scary and hard even for hardcore Don't Starve players.  Cons: - You need friends; - I still Starve alone, except faster because I do less damage, even when alone on server - Most servers are either full or completely empty when they are near me, but ones which have free slots and allow other players to join (randoms like me) have over 600ping, so they must be on the other side of the world That means if you are in east Europe like me, you should think about whether you have someone to play with or don't. - At least to me, caves hinder the performance because you need 2 servers to have caves, toaster users shouldn't buy this game, because I did and I know that they shouldn't.    9/10, because I like the game a lot except I can't play it on random server as freely as I thought I could.",

One friend dragged a pack of wild dogs back to the base camp after he started losing, killing half the team in the process... he never really apologized for that. Another got lost in the dark and started a forest fire to find their way back to base camp one... we now live at base camp two. And yet another went insane and began fighting shadowy terrors that none of use could see, so to us it looked like he was running around base camp swinging at the air and screaming about demons... it takes a game like this to actually make you consider the fact that your friends actual sanity might have drained along with their avatars.

            "review_text": "I love this game. It is one of those games you can put so much hours into, and not get bored. As of the time I am writing this I only have... *ahem* 2.2 hours... But I just enjoy this game so much. There are some pros and cons about this game, so I'll give you a 'quick' description of them.   The Paper-Cut-Out Graphics are just too good to hate! It is a HUGE Improvement from the single-player experience, since exploring with friends is just so much more fun. The co-op Wilderness is my favorite, but I also enjoy competetive and madness, but social takes away the survival experience. Social is obviously for people getting to know each other or creating items and bases in a non-hostile zone. I didn't enjoy that aspect of it that much.  The game is quite hard to play if you are new, but you drastically get better and better once you realize how the game works and which enemies do what. I do like that aspect, but I think it could be improved if the enemies had more attacks and patterns, because you can easily evade most enemies' attacks. Another way they could improve is make some enemies' attacks slower, and some faster. For instance, the frog's attack consists of it sticking its tounge out and hurting you. This attack could be done faster for a more challenging game. Most enemies are simple to kill since they barely do damage, but watch out if you are surronded by a horde of them, because they can easily take you out in seconds. But ranged weapons are powerful and easy to use, so some of them are better off nerfed just a bit.   The tools are fun to use, and the first two, quite easy to make. Harvesting wood or stone in this game is brilliant, since you have to repeaditly click to chop or mine. The animation is also very great! Your character pulls back their axe or pickaxe and pull it forward quickly in a realistic motion, unless your are clicking extremely fast.  So those are my pros and cons. This game definately has more pros than cons, so I reccomend this game to everyone who enjoys a little challenge!",

So many multiplayer games that iv'e played only allow you to game with locals. DST? worldwide. If your worried about connection, it tells you your ping so you can select the best server for you. Gameplay? Fabulous. It includes so much more than the normal DS and is constantly being added to every now and then. For example, they just released a new boss mob, the bee queen. How awesome is that. The artstyle is outstanding and the ability to add mods just makes DST a whole new experience for gamers. I rate 10/10. Obama out *mike drop*.",

Exploration, building, and survival is fun but the big problems is that after a while the game feels less like fun and more like a chore. Even with a fully established camp I feel like I spend more than half of the time just preparing and doing basic maintenace (planting food, planting trees, getting wood, building lightning rods, building sprinklers, etc...) just so I can go out and explore or do other things I find fun.  As you advance you can certainly do these things more efficiently but they still take up a huge portion of your time and it starts feeling less like a game and more like work. I'm not sure if this was done to obscure the fact that there isn't much of and endgame but its annoying.",

            "review_text": "  I was originally bagered by a friend to download this game so we could play together.  All I can say is, i'm glad I didn't spend my own money on this game.  To sum it up, you run around as different selectable cartoon characters- each with their own strength in 'something' and each with their own particular weakness.  EX: Willow gains sanity points from fire, however if she becomes insane begins to freeze to death.  EX 2: Wendy has a ghost sidekick (her sister) who can fight for/with her. She can aggro and tank enemies, and deal damage. However Wendy herself has some of the lowest base attack damage in the game and has a hard time killing without her ghost.  The goal is simple: To survive. You must run around and gather food, collect materials, and build items to help you survive through each season or die. (EX: you need to gather items and craft warm clothing for the winter season or risk freezing to death). You also have to fight with the strange creatures that inhabit the land, some friendly but many of which will try to kill you for no reason. There are also boss fights at set intervals in the game, usually one for each season.  HOWEVER.  Why am I not giving this game a positive review?  Honestly this game loses its novelty very quickly. Once you survive through all the seasons at least once, you have gathered basically everything you need to survive those four seasons again. (The seasons loop).   The only real task you will have is basically gathering from then on, as you've probably explored 99% of the map by the end of the four seasons. You'll run around just restocking on food, if you haven't already created your base camp next to the beefalo (some of the best source of meat in the game) and relocated all the tree's, saplings, and berry bushes you need right around your camp. Although you will have to leave to gather ores, as rocks are the only thing unrelocatable for convinence.  The only real replay value in this game is if you decide you want to try to survive with a different character, which will require some slight tweaking on how you approach surviving but not by extremely too much unless your the mime guy who basically dies to everything.   So sure, feel free to survive until day 100.....day 200.....day 300. It's just gonna be a repeat of all the crap you spent doing the first runthrough of the 4 seasons. Nothing new really occurs.  The Caves BETA is a very nice addition to the game, Kudo's to the developers on it. It does add another intresting layer of depth to the game. Instead of trying to survive on the base map you can try to survive underground in the caves, which poses a whole new set of challenges, and different creatures/plants/objects inhabit the caves below. That being said once you conquer the caves your back to the original rinse and reuse and repeat problem as stated above.  FINAL VERDICT:  First 3-4 playthroughs: 7.5/10  Replayability: 3/10  S/N: Im serious guys, It got to a point where me and my friend legit had nothing else to do and conquer in the game that I started arranging berry bushes and tree's for fun for about 2 hours. Save yourself the sanity.          ",
