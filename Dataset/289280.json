            "review_text": "When I bought this for 1.24 I was a little skeptical, but after about 9 hours in and done the game, I can saftely say it's more than worth it, at first the game did feel pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥, weapons shoot much differently than what you'd expect, the camera bobs when you pull the trigger and overall it felt awkward and clunky, but I gave it another chance and holy crap it's really fun! Weapons are actually satsyfying to use, it's nice to one shot an enemy on the head with my pistel and see a cloud of blood fill his face as he turns into a ragdoll, sometimes they'll fly all over the place!   The lack of checkpoints REALLY help the tension and add to the experiance, I don't savescum and it really made the game a lot more tense at moments because when you die you have to start at the begining of the level. Bulletime is usefull but it's a little TOO slow, there are a variety of weapons but sadly only a handfull of them you'll actually use because there are weapons that are just simply innefective, maybe it's just me but I found the dual UZI to be a really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing to use. The bossfights are just enemies with a lot of health but it's not neciccarly a bad thing, could've been more though. There's a variety of levels in this game, from jungles to mansions, nothing too special here. Music fits each situation but it may not be something you'll wanna download and put on a mp3 player.  Overall this is a really good game, pretty underrated at that. Gameplay is where El Matador shines and I highly recommend this to any fan of the Max Payne series or third person shooters in general. Even the starting price of 5 dollars is worth buying the game for.",

            "review_text": "Ruined piece of obsolete junk. I've played it through when it was new on the shelves. Can't say it was fresh even then, back in the 2006. And now it even cannot be started with almost any decent GPU, not to mention newest ones.  Don't cry for it. It was a clone for Max Payne game, only with generic and cliche-over-the-top drug-hunting-policeman story. Visuals were bad, and I mean, really bad, worse than in Max Payne 1 (which was shipped in 2001). Backstages were somewhat colourful, however, I can give them that. Controls and move-caption were decent (as 1/2 of what we saw in Max Payne). And it was a long game, by the TPS standards. But because all the subject was pretty dumb, it wasn't leave any marks in my memory.  RIP, another generic Cenega useless shooter. I'll score a 4.99/10 on your grave.  PS: little 2016 update: the game is not running properly on the Win 7, Win 8 and Win 10. If you still have PC with Win XP as the prime system - maybe you'll work this out. Compatibility fixes aren't doing any good. I heard some people with WIn 7 who was able to run the game, but I was unable to repeat their 'Success'. Well, anyway, like I said, the game is dead. The deleloper team is no longer exist, so, no patches, no real help. Just don't buy this stuff.",
