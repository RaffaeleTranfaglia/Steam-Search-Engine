            "review_text": "A fun and easy to play metroidvania that doesn't overstay its welcome. The big difference between this and Risky's Revenge gameplay-wise is that the various animal forms are exchanged for pieces of pirate equipment that hit all the cues of a metroidvania; you have your triple jump, speed dash, hover ability, et al.  Stage layout and dungeon design are simple enough, but the 'overworld' aspects of each island is a little too similar outside of their general theme. The game is collectible friendly in that each level keeps a visible tally of how many hidden items are each level and how many you have already tracked down. There's enough stuff to find to incentivize revisiting areas but not too many that looking for secrets feels like a slog or unrewarding.   The soundtrack is as nice and catchy as is most of Jake “virt” Kaufman's stuff. The spritework is good and the game controls well. Using the inventory/map is a little clunky, but not a big negative by any means. Pirate's Curse is a relatively easy game, though it has a couple of areas that can be kind of a pain, like the stealth section and a final leg that's significantly harder platforming-wsie than the rest of the game, though it's not especially hard.  All in all, a nice little game that will take most people between 8-12 hours to finish but I can see it having a good bit of replaybility since once you beat the game you can start a new game with all of your pirate skills unlocked from the start, so you can triple jump, speed dash and so on right from the start. ♥♥♥♥ like that rules and means I'll probably play this again some time in the future.  One last thing, if the idea of cartoon boobs drives you crazy and makes you want to make a forums post about it, pass on this. There are tons of boobs everywhere but if you have any background with original property WayForward games, this isn't a surprise in the least. WayForward loves boobs. If you love cartoon boobs and metroidvania's, this is the game for you.",

Although I did find that it was rather easy, and it seemed shorter/more compartmentalized than the previous one. Rather than having an 'open' map to explore, you're given seperate worlds, which I guess makes it seem smaller, even if it's about the same size. Still gives for a good length playthrough though.  The story is a good continuation, and there's lots of humour to be found in it. The art is very good, keeping in style. There are some good and some great music tracks to go with the levels.  Good game. In terms of your engagement, it may work as a standalone game, but probably works better as a sequel to the previous one (risky's revenge), given that the story and characters follow on.",

            "review_text": "Shantae and the Pirate's Curse is a classic 2D action platformer with metroidvania elements. However, compared to most generic modern platformers, Shantae and the Pirate's Curse distinguishes itself by the highest level of quality, with WayForward's pedigree in game development clearly visible throughout the whole game. Actually, this game is a part of an established series, being the third and latest installment to date.  The first thing you'll notice is the overall quality of graphics and animation, with the game being mostly done in awesome high-quality pixel art. Shantae also takes advantage of modern platforms by using high-resolution character sprites for dialogue segments. Everything looks even better in motion — the animations are surprisingly detailed and very smooth, so the fact that there are a lot of them in the game is a cherry on top. Shantae and the Pirate's Curse combines regual 2D pixel-art and modern visual effects, which look together better than you'd think. The game runs at 60 FPS, like platformers used to, and actually, should be played. Super smooth animations and super precise movement — eye candy and a soothing experience where the character moves exactly like you want them to.  Music and sound effects in Shantae and the Pirate's Curse don't fall short of the graphics, with the game featuring a large number of high quality and atmospheric music tracks, which greatly fit not only the overall game, but individual levels and characters as well. And since we're on the topic of levels, it should be mentioned that level design in Shantae and the Pirate's Curse is great, both in terms of visuals and platforming. It's clear that developers at WayForward are masters of old school platforming, employing challenging and interesting design, traps, secrets and everything else that makes this game feel like such classics as Megaman.  Every world in the game (seven in total) not only has its own visual theme and music, but is also designed around different types of platforming that you'll need to employ. Some levels feature platforming that is heavily influenced by games such as Megaman, while metroidvania elements present themselves mainly through the world being a bunch of inter-connected locations, presence of hidden areas and new locations slowly becoming accessible with new item acquisition.  Unlike previous games in the series, where Shantae used her magic, this time you're faced with the fact that she lost it (in the previous game), so she must overcome the challenges with various items that she'll come across through the game. Usually in a game like this items would be for unlocking / adding abilites, and weapons would be used for fighting, but in Shantae even weapons unlock new abilities to the player.   The game world consists of different islands that are unlocked after completing boss fights. These boss fights aren't that difficult, especially if you stock up on healing items, but fun nonetheless. Bosses are very large, and have a cool design, which comes in variety - a huge-♥♥♥ tank straight outta Metal Slug, a misspelled fire-breathing monstrosity Dagron, and of course, an abomination to your screen space in form of the final boss (true form only).  To sum it up, Shantae and the Pirate's Curse is a joy to play, not only because of visuals and sound, but stellar level design and gameplay. An interesting cute protagonist also helps. For some reason people mostly missed out on this gem, with SteamSpy estimating sales at ~25K. But you definitely should buy and play this game, even if you aren't a fan of the genre.  P.S. For more awesome hidden gems, follow the  CRIMINALLY Low Sales  steam curator.",

            "review_text": "Shantae, the half-genie heroine of Shantae and the Pirate's Curse, is more than just an upstart in the Metroidvania genre – she's the new star. At a glance, Shantae and the Pirate's Curse may look like a game for kids, but it's actually very deep and expertly designed, appealing on a variety of levels from platforming and exploration, to music and visual style. I love the sense of humor, too – there are tons of outrageous gags that make both the good guys and the bad guys completely lovable.   More so than its predecessor, Risky's Revenge, Pirate's Curse feels like a platformer, with more clearly-defined levels (islands that you sail to) and difficult platforming segments that require multiple attempts to complete. There's a general lack of warp points within the levels, which can make for a bit of frustration when you realize that you have to go through an entire area again to pick up something you missed. Also, the whole game feels a bit too small, and I wish there were more support items to use (like the pike balls) to add more depth to the gameplay.  Problems aside, Shantae and the Pirate's Curse is the most fun I've had with this genre since the classic 2D Castlevania games. It's funny, stylish, and all-around an outstanding game that I heartily recommend.   (Rating: 8.5/10 “Excellent”)  Notes: I played Shantae and the Pirate's Curse with an Xbox 360 Controller for Windows. I recommend using a console controller like this for all platformer-type games, since it allows for greater precision control.",

            "review_text": "Well, I have a lot of good things to say about this one. For starters, I didn't play any other Shantae games other than this. But judging by the trailers for the other games, I can easily assume this is the best. This game came out last year on 3DS and Wii U, and just a few months ago was ported to the PC. Here's my review.  The game plays like your average platformer. You control Shantae, who uses her hair to whip enemies, although later she gets upgrades like a gun, etc. The controls feel very smooth and responsive. You travel through six locations where you have to accomplish certain things and then go to the dungeon of the world. This heavily reminds me of Zelda, especially considering there are chests, keys, items, puzzles, etc. There are also a lot of secret items throughout the game. You can get jellies, which you can turn into health, and there are also bats I think that give you dark magic (you'll find out the use as you play). Also, you can use money earned from defeating enemies to buy one-time items (spike balls, shields, potions, etc.) or permanent upgrades (faster whip, more powerful, etc.). One thing I don't like is that some items are hidden in places that you either don't see (so either you have to get to them by complete accident or by trial and error), or that look like you can get them but you really can't. For example, there is a section in the sand that has tiny platforms that break upon touching them. I got very frustrated trying to get it, only to give up and learning that you can get it, but only after getting an upgrade. If it was more obvious that I couldn't get it, then I wouldn't have to be frustrated.  Presentation-wise, this game has great graphics. They are in a 16-bit SNES style, although on top of that, there are full artworks of the characters in-dialogs. For some reason, WayForward decided to use a default font for the dialogs, which looks quite ugly and annoying if you ask me. The soundtrack? Don't even ask. It's f*cking amazing. The composer also made the soundtrack for Shovel Knight, Duck Tales Remastered, Contra 4, etc. There isn't full voice acting, only occasional words by certain characters are pronounced, ususally sound good, but can get annoying at times.  Well, this game isn't super long either. You can beat it in three hours easily. Do I recommend it? Definitely. It is a little expensive compared to other indies (20$), but I still think it's worth it. Buy it, you'll like it!",

The animations are fantastic, the game is really polished from top to bottom. All the characters are so cute and sexy at the same time. It's one of those games, that's just a lot of fun.

Battle monsters, upgrade weapons and search labyrinths for rare treasures and items.  Like the previous installment, the game stands out with great music, beautiful art, solid controls, lovable characters and a memorable story that never takes itself too seriously. Note that it has more content than the previous games, including an unlockable 'Pirate Mode', multiple endings and enough achievements to challenge even hardcore players. The only significant flaw is the lack of transformation magic (and sexy dances) due to the events of the previous game.

All the pirate weapons blend together to make a more natural action-platformer with some light backtracking. Some really funny moments, great artwork (best so far) and some fantastic music.   Some levels have some crazy tricks to sort out but nothing too hard if you've played any platformer game I'd wager.   The other Shantae games suffered a bit from difficulty spikes or overcomplication of the powers &amp; Navigation which this game overcomes and creates a really fun game to go through.

It will all be familiar to you, However if this is your first Shantae game, I would put a word of warning on the pixel graphics on a monitor as oppose to the usual 3ds or wii U screen. I found during my play through that while I still love this game, There was a noticeable amount of screen tearing going on. Not exactly jarring but definitely noticeable.  How does it run? Well considering that it pretty much is just a straight port to PC, It runs pretty well. No experiences with crashes or Bugs during my play through. And pretty smooth as well.   A major up vote from me again as usual is the soundtrack. A lot of us were worried that they would recycle some of the old tracks like they have done with the visuals But I was amazed and taken back by the Games OST. Its a real treat and I would definitely recommend getting it if you can. Big praises to way forward again here.  I wont go into the story as its hard to tell it without spoiling it. Lets just say.... You are a Belly Dancing Half Genie that's the hero of scuttle town.... And Pirate stuff. Everyone loves pirate stuff.   I would say if your a big fan of Shantae, Its a definite must have where as if you are curious about Shantae and the series in general, check it out and see what you have been missing.

            "review_text": "Shantae and the Pirate's Curse is a massive improvement over the previous games in the series, giving abilities to the player that activate instantly upon a button press and favoring faster progression. Gameplay-wise, it's what teh previous game SHOULD have been. The game-pad controls make it so much easier to get into than Risky's Revenge, which I played with Keyboard (So that might be why), and the story is light-hearted and comical but knows just when to get serious. The tone is always changing and always perfect for every moment in the game, and the Metroidvania aspect isn't as frustrating, except for a few specific instances, as previous titles in the series. All in all, if you are trying to get the real ending (Multiple endings depending on if you got all the dark-magic or not) than you'll probably end up with a game lasting a few hours, mine was eight but I overpreppared for the final boss (I was worried that I sucked at the game more than I did) and missed a single dark magic so I had to fight him twice to get the right ending. So a few hours, not that long, maybe not worth the full price, but ONLY if you want your money to exclusively buy very long games. It's short, despite being hte longest game in teh series thus far, but you have to ask yourself, 'A long but mediocre game, or a short but awesome one?' Extra Credits on Youtube said it perfectly, 'Awesome Per Second.'",

This game features gorgeous (pixel)art, funky music, much love for details, lots of light-hearted humor, amicable characters, upgradable attacks, many secrets to be discovered and a good amount of platforming sequences.  The biggest drawback are the overpowered consumable items you can acquire in the shop (which also can be looted from enemies). Other than that I enjoyed this game greatly and would recommend it to everyone seeking a new metroidvania adventure.",

            "review_text": "Very good 'japanese platformer' game (they call it Metroidvania).   Seems like a PC conversion of a console game, which was really decently performed. Full-screen action, very fluid moves, excellent retro music, nice 2-D high-res still graphics. Compared to the PC version of the former Shantae game, it's a great leap forward technically speaking.  It's a classic gameplay, but perfectly crafted. Perfectly. It's more jumps-oriented than beat-em-up, it requires some precision more than fast reflexes, but that's very pleasing.   It's not 'just an idie game': the studio here is a veteran of MetroVania games and worked on big console licences too: they fukken know their job. We don't have so many games of this kind on PC, so just buy it.  The gameplay is a little demanding: all controls respond very fast and smoothly, but you need to be precise in all. Over time, training takes place and you really enjoy it, but it seems odd at the beginning for a PC player.   CONS: you need an xbox controller, and can't reassign keys, although you could in the former game. Since it was developped for a portable console, most GFX are upscaled even though it remains very good overall. Too bad they did not redraw the main protagonists in higher resolution (will be made in next episode). Also, 19 € is a little expensive, but you can get way cheaper keys.  Excellent fan service too. Dialogs and story are funny. A bit lenghty at the beginning, but then action takes place. Characters and story are stupid, light-minded, but funny.   tl;dr: good console game, really worth trying, addictive in the end.",
