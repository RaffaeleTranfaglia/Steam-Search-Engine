            "review_text": "I should have known I wouldn't enjoy this given how the previous game ended. chopin becomes some kind of weird ♥♥♥♥♥♥ with a keytar at the end of the first game, and then you spend this game running around playing a lot of music that sounds good but some pairings don't make sense, like pairing an abba sounding song with a kiss themed band, cause that makes sense, I saw 'Hiss' and was obviously psyched to play a kiss themed song, turns out to be abba and I knew I wasn't gonna enjoy this. baring in mind I skipped every god damn cutscene cause I could not stand them this time around, I watched the first one, realised this was how they were gonna do the rest of them and decided forget it I'll just skip through everything. and honestly I feel like I dodged a bullet with that decision given how much I disliked the rest of the game. Now to explain how impossible it is to play this on pc, so I played the last game with my mouse and had a generally good time the story was dumb and the ending fairly awful, but the music was good , this time you cannot play with a mouse no matter how good you are with one. basically from the onset you are beset with a swarm of notes that you will miss most of, and as you go further it obviously gets harder and more likely you will get a lower score. Keyboard is no better you're undoubtedly off tempo with keyboard, like I changed up the keybindings for keyboard and, even though I followed the tempo i still missed almost every note. So yeah controls are awful seriously just play this with touch input. there is a point where I almost quit because a German dancing robot hit me with a million simultaneous notes at once, like how do you hit all those notes at once? do i just slam my hand all over the keyboard and hope for the best? Maybe I should have headbutt my monitor for best results.  TLDR:  Aside from some decent music, this game is a definite pass.  Play the previous title in the series, way more fun and you get to play as a proper respected Chopin, not some swaglord ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who by the end of the game goes super saiyan for some ridiculous reason.  If you absolutely must get this game wait for a sale, do NOT buy at full price it's not worth it.  2/10",

            "review_text": "Maybe it's just me, but I feel this game is very underrated just like the first one and deserves another look at by the community if for no other reason then just the soundtrack alone is brilliant, and if I remember correctly consists of music that is similar to the style of the parody of the musician you are currently dueling. (Spoiler!: look out for the smooth criminal in Hollywood) The artwork seems to have been improved as well in this version, but the same cheesy humor that is prevalent in the first game is still here and has only been enhanced. This whole style of dialogue is reminiscient of monkey island, which if you haven't guessed yet is one of my favorites. Don't buy this game for it's gameplay value unless you really enjoy Rhythm based games such as guitar hero or Dance dance revolution-esque gaming. However if you appreciate both visual and auditory art then i would recommend shelling out a few dollars for this lesser-known masterpiece.",

            "review_text": "This second game in the instalment is a dissapointment. The developers should have continued with the idea of Chopin battles using his 'remixed' original works, as there countless pieces to choose from. The music score is indifferent and boring. The game is filled with un-thought of characters and the plot has no direction or 'suprise' factor. I highly recommend playing the original but this second game gets lost amongs hundreds of other mediocre titles currently on sale in the gaming market.",

This sequel brings again the formula of the previous Frederick with little improvement but the musics are much tougher then the previous resulting in a greater and funner challenge.  In this sequel musics are even nicer than the previous as much as the story is so lame... really, really lame. Too bad because the idea behind it is nice.  I still reccomend it.",
