            "review_text": "I want to go ahead and say that I'll be doing a review when I actually beat the game as well. Enola is one of those games that isn't going to be remembered for it's graphics, or framerate, or anything really game related. Enola is a psychological horror game (to me at least so far) that's all about exploring the darkness of the mind of your girlfriend, Angelica, and discovering what the mind does to you after a series of terrible events. Without giving t much aware, Angelica went through some pretty godawful things in her past, and it's haunted her to this day, so far that she descends into madness, and you, Enola, have to take a step into that madness to save the woman you love. Now, off the bat, this game doesn't look as good most, and the sound isn't great, but for what the game is going for in terms of: creating a world that makes no sense and isn't for the weak of willed, or stomachs. The game throws you into creepy mannequin ladies, an eerie island, and cryptic clues scattered everywhere as to what's going on. From what I've played through so far, it's an interesting game with a lot of interesting ideas, even if it could look better. The controls are a bit stiff, but my experience so far has been a great build-up to whatever resolution lies as the end of this mystery. If you want a dark but interesting thriller kind of game, I reccommend this so far. I don't know if this will be my final opinion though, so I can't completely confirm it yet, but so far it's be enjoyable enough to reccommend to others!",

Gameplay was amazing. Nice mix of a dark atmosphere, spooky music and jump scares. But besides a story rich game it has the rep to be bug rich. I have never come across any bugs playing this game ssooooo there's that. I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone. Also lesbians ãƒ„",

            "review_text": "If Enola had been released in 2005, then the graphics, controls, and level design still would have been subpar. Though I can give props for the plot, I'm not interested in stomaching the actual meat of the game to find it. I've played it only a little less than an hour at this point, but its production value traps any depth it might have in the realm of the Lifetime Original Movie. I honestly believe that this game should never have been sold; free download perhaps. I would have just stuck it on an HDD and never released it at all. ",

The voice acting here is absolutely terrific: innocent happiness in the girl's tone change drastically into raw pain and uncontrollable anger, creating the living believable character. The game, however, is far from being perfect on it's technical and design sides and deserves more polishing and more visual quality in general.",

The continuarity is almost non-existant. The level design needs work. There's no natural flow to the levels. We just kept...Going down and down.Also, a lot of bug testing needs to be done. Also, get rid of the Master Sword re-color in the elevator room. Seriously. That's enough about the negative, the positive would be this; Great looking for an indie game and very off-putting. I'll continue to play the game through, but just off the first hour, I'm impressed, but also not impressed.",
