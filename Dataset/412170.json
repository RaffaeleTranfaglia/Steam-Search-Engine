            "review_text": "There are over 1000+ RPG maker games on steam. Some good ones.. mostly bad ones... but none I played so far can even remotely compare to city of chains.  Most RPG maker game background are set to medievl time with magic and blade however city of chains set in a future world in a city controled strickly by the goverment with it's peoples supressed hashly and cities don't have much freedom at all.  General game background is dark and deep while the story progression is quite light and relaxing and every story choices makes a bit difference. If you spare all the lifes you get to be with the nurse researcher goal or if you decide to leave a lot of body with bulletholes you get the gangester gothic girl instead. The choice is yours.  There are surprising amount of good musics in the game on different stages and different situations. Heavy metal steam punk music but it's not too rough to your ears.  Graphics are like an rpg maker version of Deus Ex simpler in graphics but still give you a dark and deep feeling of the city.  The difficulty if this game is not that hard even on highest difficulty. Your character don't really gain levels but each win will earn you some cash and item. You can just walk around for a while and your characters will heal automaticly. (avoid the first aid on the wall .. if u use it .. you will miss an achievment like i did). Do as much side quest as you can find and complete them you get skill points from mission and side mission. Skill points and equipments are the only 2 ways for you to improve your character.  The achievements of this game are quite simple to get most are found side quests. A few hidden ones depend on your story progression choices. (there is a hidden quest that you need to be mean to hostiage girl to get). 3 ways to end the game and 6 different total variations. This will make you have to complete the whole game at least 2-3 times to get them all.  8.5/10 ....Overall i really enjoyed this RPG maker game and you should be too if you try it.",

            "review_text": "In this game you're no soldier or warrior, you're an engineer and a fugitive. Why? Because you refused to help your government. You were arrested, you escaped and now you're trying to survive.  City of Chains is an RPG-maker inspired by games like Final Fantasy. Each one person has his own set of skills and specialty. What is interesting here is that you have some freedom in how you approach each situation. You can fight or avoid combat completely. You can even find alternate routes to your objectives.  However, as usual for RPG maker' games, City of Chains is short (About five hours) and that's a very bad ",
