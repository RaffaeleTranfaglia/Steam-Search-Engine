            "review_text": "Incredible, atmospheric experience and a work of art.  From the design standpoint Aquaria is a Metroidvania 2D game with big underwater world to explore. Those ideas aren't that special on paper, but the strange mix of climactic locations, fitting music and hand-drawn graphics makes this title not only joy to look and hear, but also leave so big impact on the player that after you finish the game you will know that is one of the best indie games out there yet to be recognized by most of gaming community.  The story is simple, but it is told extremely well by the voice of the main protagonist as you play the game. It starts out interesting, but it ends up strongly heart-touching. The plot is slowly revealed through the game and the next surprise around the corner will be bigger than the former. Also, in my opinion, Naija is one of the best written female characters in video game industry up to date.  Aquaria is an open world and you must figure out most of the gameplay mechanics all by yourself. Some tactics for beating some bosses are kind of tricky, so this isn't the game for people that are not so fond of the more exploration-oriented games. The start of this game isn't as fast as you would want to, but if you will give it some time you will be hooked straight to the finish. Game is around 12-20 hours long and there are lots of non-mandatory things to find. This is not a small game by any means.  Aquaria had a bad luck that it came before the Braid's indie games boom. Don't miss this one. It's a powerful gem hidden in the sea.",

            "review_text": "**THIS REVIEW CONTAINS NO SPOILERS**  Flawed. This game is flawed as hell. Aquaria does a lot of things excellently, but also flounders on principle gameplay mechanics. For these reasons, I find it very difficult to decide if I want to give this game a Thumbs Up or Thumbs Down.   Ultimately, I will say Yes to recommending this game, but before you buy this, you need to ask yourself a few things. Do you enjoy the Metroidvania subgenre? Would you get great enjoyment out of exploration and appreciating the varied and well-done aesthetics? Would this enjoyment mean you could tolerate very long travel times between places you need to be while doing simplistic, shallow combat? If this sounds appealing to you, then buy Aquaria. $10 is a bargain.  Alright, down to the specifics.  I'll start with what I liked about the game, which is primarily the aesthetics. Aquaria, bar none, blows every other game I've ever played in my 20+ years of playing games out of the water when it comes to underwater levels. The game boasts a huge variety of marine biology, both plant and animal life. Each major area of the game has its own unique feel and theme, with unique sealife to match. I don't think I can recall any enemies that looked like an iterative version of an earlier one, even if some enemy's behaviors are similar. This game simply wows when it comes to the underwater places you'll go.  The music, while not quite the best I've heard for an indie game, gets the job done nicely. Each track is pleasant to listen to and generally fits the theme of the area you're in, even if they can be a bit too upbeat at times. Boss battle music feels a bit too quiet, but it's not the worst I've heard.  Naija, voiced by Jenna Sharpe, impressed me with her consistently good voice work for the game. Although the majority of the lines involve the main character talking to herself, she puts forth enough emotion to stop from sounding bored, and gives enough conviction to the more stressful moments for Naija to sound believable. Considering how bad many video games' voice acting is, this voicework was a breath of fresh air.  Unfortunately, Aquaria frustrated me when it came down to its gameplay mechanics, or at least the 'feel' of them. The game, being a Metroidvania, primarily involves exploring and fighting things. Neither of these felt great to me, and it's for a few specific reasons.  Exploring the game's areas, as well as figuring out where to go, became tedious for me quickly and didn't really stop until the end. Aquaria, like many games in its subgenre, doesn't tell you exactly where to go next. Naturally, that means both wandering and using process-of-eliminiation to find your next desination, and those are big draws to playing games like these. However, this game makes those very tedious to go through due to both the huge size of the zones as well as the twisty, maze-like caverns that connect them. The minimap zooms in too much to the map, so I had to keep reopening my main map in order to not get lost. Furthermore, many times I sighed in frustration as I realized I'd have to cross a huge, enemy-filled zone in order to check if one spot on my map would lead me to somewhere relevant.  Normally, this wouldn't be too big an issue, if the game provided fast travel. Well, Aquaria does, but it involves finding turtles who will take you to another turtle's position, and you have to find at least two of these spots before you can use it. The turtles are spread few and far between, and often off the beaten path of a zone. Therefore, there may as well not be any fast travel present for the majority of one's time in the game.  As for the combat, unfortunately I found it lukewarm. Early on you get the ability to shoot lasers at enemies, but enemies have so much health that swimming past them is typically a better solution. This gets especially annoying when you have to deal with enemies whose projectiles chase you down until you do a 180 so they disappear or crash into the wall, or have enemies who will chase you down and can actually keep up with you. Combine that with the game's lack of health items early on and it's very annoying. As a side note, using said ability doesn't really feel nice either. The attack has a very quiet noise, and enemies simply disappear when they die. It's not very satisfying at all.   The one exception to this I have is during some boss battles. Although most bosses are puzzle bosses (where you have to do a certain action to do damage to the boss), the all-out combat bosses were pretty fun! They felt like a bullet hell or SHMUP that involved both shooting endless amounts of projectiles at the enemy while dodging their deadly attacks. Honestly, it got quite intense and I enjoyed those moments a lot.  The other boss battles though...it depends. As I said above, the other ones are primarily puzzle bosses, which means they challenge you to figure out how to damage the boss or make it vulnerable to attack. No spoilers on this, but the bosses ranged from 'I had to think about this for a few minutes' to 'how in the world am I supposed to figure that out?'. Have no shame if you need a walkthrough for these, as the clues for what to do on them are very vague.  Granted, I say all these things as someone who doesn't typically play Metroidvanias. Considering the high amount of positive reviews this game has, I imagine people haven't found these to be as serious issues as I, or disagree with my interpretation of them. Regardless, please note that if you buy Aquaria, you're going to be going into it for the atompshere and exploration, and the combat is mostly passable.  In the end, I'd say if you find the game interesting and you enjoy Metroidvanias, I'd say try it. Perhaps this game is not my typical 'cup of tea', as the phrase goes.",

            "review_text": "Great little metroidvania (but underwater!), full of surprisingly fresh design and great worldbuilding and attention to detail, but marred by unexplainably bad design choices. In this review I'm focusing on the negatives(which I feel haven't been emphasized enough), because the positives have already been described in good details by damn near everyone else.  - Gamepad support is abysmal. Truly, unexplainably abysmal. Menu controls are awkward (and plain don't work in the map screen) and there are no 'look' keys and no form-changing shortcuts (which makes several fights a LOT harder than they should be). The worst part is that the movement on the keyboard is equally bad, so your best bet is to play it on a gamepad and have the keyboard real close to tap the form keys as needed. - Gimmicky boss designs, especially for some of the optional bosses. The octopus is a particularly annoying offender. - Save points are sparse, especially in the early game, and always feel like they're slightly too far from the minibosses, which are almost universally harder than the story bosses and likely to take you more than one go. - Most of the puzzles can be cracked with a little thought and feel quite intuitive, but one in particular on the second-to-last dungeon is a complete ♥♥♥. - Achievement completion pretty much requires guide usage, as two achievements are linked to a hidden, unmarked room in a corner that no one in their right mind would try to poke. - True ending ends in an obvious sequel hook that will never be covered, as the studio's dissolved.  Aside from all of these picked nits (some of which not so nitty), it's still a gorgeous game, with a great soundtrack, rewarding exploration and cute little touches here and there. Very much recommended, just be ready to deal with some eventual ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.",

            "review_text": "What is the reason we fall in love with a game? Is it the visuals that are aesthetically pleasant and utilize some original style? Or is it the world, the story, the characters? Maybe the biggest thing is gameplay mechanics, or if we speak about metroidvania genre in particular the complexity of the vast map and its clever design, which makes nearly every path valid and interesting? That matters a lot if a developer can not only make a bunch of interesting locations separated by obstacles that require special abilities or items to pass them, but also performs a miracle of guiding you through it without showing direction with a giant red arrow on the map. Feeling not lost, but intrigued like a true discoverer traversing unknown grounds — that matters a lot. And Aquaria has all of that and more. It has voice and sound. Beautiful and soothing voice of the protagonist narrating events throughout the game being as clueless as the player. And a truly amazing soundtrack, which is not just some “accompanying music”, but a masterpiece on its own. It stands out like a pearl lying on the ocean’s floor shining against the background of dull sand. And it has one fatal truly hurting me flaw, which makes me love this game even more. That must be stupid — to love something because of the defect, one might think. But this one is special. Aquaria ends on a high note with a cliffhanger of such enormous proportions, that the fact that sequel most probably wouldn’t happen ever makes me sad ‘till the present day. A craftsmanship of just two guys, it came out in 2007, and it has been 7 years since then. Bit Blot studio is effectively defunct. Derek Yu created wonderful Spelunky, and Alec Holowka composed a lot of wonderful soundtracks for a number of games and collaborated on various projects, ultimately launching the successful Kickstarter campaign for a Night in the Woods, which looks very promising. To tell you the truth, the story of an underwater journey is still very much satisfying, it closes script arch in a wonderful way, with a proper resolution and sensible ending. It’s just that final little itty-bitty glimpse, that promises more of Aquaria to come, that sticks to my brain. And I can’t let go. Among hundreds of games that I played it’s the one I easily can name as one of the most beloved. But obviously that moment in the end wouldn’t irritate me if the game itself was mediocre. So let’s talk about it for a moment, instead of grieving the never-happening-sequel. You play as Naija. You can call her a mermaid, I suppose; except she doesn’t really have that fish-like scale tail and looks more like a green-skinned girl with flippers and strange ears. So, she breathes underwater and even is able to “sing”. This is actually the main form of interaction with the world. For the most part the heroine can’t affect game objects directly. Different tunes perform different actions like lifting or shielding. But they all change “form” of Naija giving her offensive, defensive and various other abilities. In order to perform a melody the player has to select the right order of color-coded tones. Technically you are bound to do it only once, when learning it for the first time. After that you can use it with a hotkey, but then you’ll miss the one tiny detail: tones actually change depending on the region you are in. And that may not be the exact detail that makes Aquaria so great, but it is a great example of how vast the game is. Honestly: you can’t just point a finger at a single thing here and say, that it’s the most important — they all are. From the glorious warm waters of near-surface areas to the chilling thrills of deepest abyss this game just doesn’t stop to surprise. A very simplistic beginning that reflects Naija’s life as “a simple creature” in her own words transforms and grows like an underwater life itself becoming more and more complex, throwing in more mechanics, more songs, more pieces of backstory. It simply isn’t possible to draw a line here. Where does the story end and the gameplay begin? Where does the world transform into a form of a narrative? It’s just one whole engaging thing. I guess this is the best possible result for metroidvania, especially the one which starts with a phrase “The Verse binds us, narrator and explorer; my story will become your own, and yours will become mine.” But you don’t know what The Verse is yet, do you? That is the force that runs through all the Aquaria (yes, game’s world has the same name as the game itself), every living being contains small part of this power, and it can be guided with rhythms and music. This seemingly peaceful concept can deceive you in the beginning into the feeling that all of the game would be careless joy and swimming around looking at the beautiful scenery. Well, in a way it is, but as you path goes down into the darkness closer to the ocean bed the grim secrets of game’s world become uncovered. What starts as seemingly aimless journey started out of curiosity turns out to be an epic tale about extinct races, gods gone mad and ultimately finding out what this all was about… except that last tiny bit, of course, but you already know that, and it shouldn’t bother you for now. Because there’s a whole world ahead of you, don’t miss an opportunity to visit it.",

            "review_text": "Aquaria, the other indie game by bit blot, is a 2D Action Adventure game that has the feel of a Zelda game. What I mean by having the feel of a Zelda game is that in this game there is a large open area that allows the player to go anywhere that you can go providing you have the proper unlocks or tools. In this case it is her [Naija’s] Song forms. These allow her to do different things needed to get to certain parts. One of the downsides to this is that this game doesn’t really give a clear direction of where to go. You start at a certain point and you are told to just go. In a way I appreciate the game for not hand holding me like so many AAA titles of recent but on the other I got bored at times trying to swim around and find where I needed to go next.    The main character in this game is called Naija but in the beginning that is all she knew about herself, her name. You travel on through the world of Aquaria trying to find what happened to everyone else. In the process you slowly learn that the “Creator” created different races and for whatever reason became jealous of them and destroyed all of them but those races Gods. Each time you find the different Gods you find out a little more about your past and who this “Creator” really is. Eventually Naija comes across Li, who I can only assume is a human, that when she pulls of his helmet she has to kiss him in order to keep him alive and learn about him. Naija keeps mentioning that she is finally not alone but several instances of him being kidnapped by the Creator gets her angry and fights towards an inevitable final confrontation with him, the Creator.     The gameplay isn’t too much different from that of say Darksiders or Zelda: Majora’s Mask where each form of Naija’s gives her unique abilities and allows her to progress through the game. But unlike in those games in order to change forms she has 8 notes that when she sings a certain set of them it changes her into one of those forms. I would say this is a pretty unique gameplay mechanic if it wasn’t for the fact that you can just hit 1-8 on the keyboard to change forms as you learn it. Though this does make it easier it also takes away from a unique mechanic that could have really added to the game. However there are certain times where you need to either use songs you know or songs that appear in the game to progress including games of Simon Says. Her different forms include Song form (her standard singing form), Energy form(She can fire energy to combat enemies),Beast form (allows her to swim through strong currents and eat creatures),Nature form(Opens big blue and red bulbs on the map),Sun form(allowing her to see in the dark places of Aquaria),Fish form (small form that allows her to slip past enemies and travel fast), Spirit form(pretty useless, allows her to pass steam vents) and the most powerful form Dual form. Dual form combines Li and Naija into one. Li’s version of it fires very powerful charged up shots that when he kills 3 enemies with it allows Naija’s form to scream and kill just about everything on the map. On top of her different forms another nice mechanic is the crafting/cooking system. In the game there are 52 cooking recipes that have all sorts of different effects that include healing, stat enhancement and even boost attacks/skills. In order to get the materials to cook however you must either kill the creatures (some of which will fight you some won’t) or harvest them out of song plants. Song plants are unique “chests” that in order to open them you need to sing the note corresponding to the color of the plant.    I’m going to mention to talk more about the art than the actual graphics. I absolutely loved the art style of this game, everything all the way down to the plants and small creatures were well drawn and looked amazing. Each area was unique and looked nothing like the others. I will say though just like in every Zelda game, Aquaria did have its own “Water Temple.” That really annoying mechanical temple that had several puzzles you want to forget about. On top of that the sound was really well done too. Each area in the game had its own music playing and even most of the bosses had unique music for the different stages of the fight. I will say that the music really added to the last couple of levels and made that part feel really awesome as I was fighting through hundreds of enemies to get to the final boss.  My final thoughts about the game is that this indie game isn’t one you should miss. I really enjoyed the game even if some parts were tedious and difficult to find where I was going. The graphics/art and sound was top notch and it even had an ending song with vocals that was really well done as well (felt kind of like Enya’s song at the end of Fellowship of the Ring). The difficulty of the game wasn’t too hard and wasn’t too simple. Your amount of health you had was very similar to that of a megaman game that if you were hit perhaps only 5-10 times you were dead if you didn’t use any health items. I had a lot of fun fighting the unique bosses and figuring out how to beat them.  • Story - 5 out of 5 • Gameplay – 4 out of 5 • Graphics – 5 out of 5 • Sound - 5 out of 5 • Fun – 5 out of 5 An overall score of 4.8 out of 5, so far out of my reviews this is the highest rated game.

At some points, it was difficult to tell what I could interact with and what was part of the background (which is not a bad thing).  You play as Naija, a humanoid sea-creature. Her primary ability is singing, which can allow her to interact with the environment or transform into other creatures. Where is really shines is how well, she harmonizes with the background music. All of it together is magical, and a showcase of great sound design.  Naija herself is a good example of how to do a proper female protagonist. Her journey is akin to an archaeologist. As she progresses, she learns more about her origins, as well as the rise and fall of the sea's various lifeforms. Later in the game, a romance spawns between Naija and another character. This romance manages to not be cheesy (something that can't be said about most video game romances), and it actually introduces some gameplay mechanics.  Everything about this game is so strong, it's hard to find something to complain about. However, I found that the cooking/crafting system was clunky when trying to make a bunch of items at once.",

Even in normal exploration you can turn from the hunter into the hunted if you don't pay attention to your surroundings.  The story does start with the stereotypical amnesia, but the rest is anything but stereotypical. The dread of being all alone ties well into the story about ruined civilizations.

Overall it has the feel of a three way cross between Legend Of Zelda, Metroid, and Ecco The Dolphin (Sega Genesis).  Art - Quite beautiful and often stunning, sometimes it's hard to not be distracted by the wonderful world around you as you fight desperately for your life. A large amount of effort and love was put into the visual styling of this game, and for all it's beauty it does well to provide immersion and confer to the player the intended emotions.  Music - Right up there with the art. The wonderful tracks run everywhere from peaceful, haunting, melancholy, frantic, sorrowful, and even cheerful a bit.'  Amazing and emotional story.

            "review_text": "I was surprised, as highly rated and recommended as this game is; that I really did not enjoy it. As metroidvanias go this one was one of the most open, never steering you in one fixed direction. The game has only a light story in the beginning and leaves it to you to explore in any direction you choose until you come across the various temples and bosses of the game. Bosses and upgrades don't have a strict order to be obtained, though some areas will require certain upgrades to access like any good metroidvania. The story does flesh out a bit later on but never does anything engrossing or epic. The game is fully voice acted, and the voice acting and music feels very high quality. Graphically the game is 2D with nice crisp textures even at high resolutions.  One of the big reasons I didn't enjoy this game much was that the upgrades weren't terribly exciting. The major upgrades in the game come in the form of new forms you can transform into. Each form usually has one big trick, like shooting, or casting light in dark places, or being able to remove obstructions. As focused as the game is on combat I would have preferred the upgrades to be more combat in nature. The first one I received I used for almost the entirety of the game for combat, with only the last form added something I felt was 'more powerful' to the mix. There's only a few health upgrades, and the rest are just decorations for your home and different costumes. Some of these are useful such as one that restores your health to 50% over time when worn, but most are just decorative. Instead the key to success against the bosses comes from cooking, which is a simple crafting system that combines enemy drops to make various dishes. Unfortunately the reliability of drops and later areas of the game being very barren for materials made this annoying. Couple that with the fact that dying takes you back to your last save as opposed to the beginning of an area or boss, and many frustrations moments were had.  My other issue with the game was the controls. You can move around with either the mouse, keyboard, or a combation of the game. As far as actually moving these controls are great. Transforming is done by playing songs with a mouse radial wheel, but there's also keyboard shortcuts (1-8) for transforming that are absolutely crucial to being able to finish the game, but the game never tells you these are there in the tutorials. Beyond that as a game set in the water precision movement was difficult. WSAD felt better than the mouse for dodging in boss fights, but it still felt very sluggish and sloppy, and things like wall jumping were more challenging than they needed to be.  If you're looking for a metroidvania this one will fit the bill, and there's lots to explore and many things to fight, but I would recommend Waking Mars if you want to explore something beautiful, and something like Cave Story+ if you want a good mix of exploring and combat.",
