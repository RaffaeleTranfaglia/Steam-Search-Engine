It's got crap performance despite being 2D pixels, the weapons suck, the controls suck, the English sucks, and you sometimes just die for no reason. Deserved to languish unloved and forever alone on Greenlight, not rip people off on Steam.  Buy only for the cards, on ultra-deep discount, if you're into that.",
