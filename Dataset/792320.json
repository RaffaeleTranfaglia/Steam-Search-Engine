    "description": "Sunburnt is a multiplayer zombie survival game where guns WON’T help you! Zombie outbreaks have struck the country, and only a few humans have survived. Conventional weapons have little effect on the dead but they have a weakness… Light which gives them intensely painful sunburns!",
