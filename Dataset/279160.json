            "review_text": "TL;DR: Retro-styled in looks, sound, and difficulty, this sidescrolling run-and-gun platformer with some shmup stages will slap you around a bit, but will still play fair.   I'll preface this by saying I got this in the Groupees Be Mine 11 bundle. And this is probably the first time I've gotten a game, downloaded it, played it, AND beat it all in the span of maybe a couple of days. So with that said...  Ultionus is the story of a woman, her robot head partner, and a social networking comment that leads to a crash landing and a lot of things to kill. As you can tell by the screenshots, it's a 'retraux' game, a modern game made with retro-inspired graphics and gameplay. You actually don't have a gun at the very start, so you need to rely on your bouncing robot head partner to destroy the enemies as you move to the left, and then you get a gun and can start blasting everything to death. This threw me off at first, but that's what experimentation is for, right?  I thought this game was pretty hard on Normal, but it wasn't unfair about it. Our heroine can only take so many hits before she explodes in a shower of cartoon hearts and respawns at the last checkpoint or stage entrance. You get restored to full health when you pass a checkpoint the first time or find a red heart 1UP. Controls are fairly tight, though Serena is a little slow on the ground and especially while firing since she stops altogether. You'll be spending most of your time in the air, and thankfully this game doesn't fall into 'Castlevania 1 jumping' where you can't change directions mid-air. Hitboxes seemed pretty accurate and there aren't really any fancy controls. For the 360 controller, A could be tapped or held to change the height you jump, X and B fire your ray gun, Y doesn't seem to do anything, and the d-pad and stick both can be used for movement. No movement faster than a leisurely walk, no sliding, no wall-jumping...simple stuff.   There are upgrades, but you not only have to find a special coin in each level, but also get to the merchant's door. I'd also add 'and have enough money to buy the upgrades' but you get money by killing everything you see, and you'll be doing that anyway. You have to choose between offense and defense, and you can only pick one per stage. If you find the coin and door that is. There are multiple routes through each normal platforming stage, and the auto-scrolling vehicle ones obviously only have one route. Get to the end of the level and you fight a giant enemy thing. Die and you start the fight all over again. Learn the boss patterns or you'll eat through your stock of lives (on Normal and Hardcore; Easy gives you infinite).   I would honestly suggest trying this on Easy first. It takes the pressure off of playing well and it'll allow you to go through stages by different routes and learn boss routines, even though running out of lives merely gives you a prompt to start the level over with 9 lives and all of your money, or exit the game. I started on Normal, and I honestly game overed twice, though I didn't get the best ending (the bad ending spells out what you need to do to avert it though). The dev has said on the Steam forum that playing on harder difficulties will unlock achievements for that and the difficulty level(s) below it. So if you get the best ending on Normal, you get the Easy achievement too, for example. There aren't many achievements but they're actually something to work towards. Without trying, I got two for winning on Normal with the bad ending and watching the credits all the way through.   Graphics are really colorful and the animations are quite nice. You can pretty easily tell what would hurt you and what won't, and there's quite a bit of detail work done here. You don't really notice the big border after a while. I didn't really feel like I'd do better if I didn't see it at all. The music's pretty catchy and I kinda wish there was a sound test option (or maybe there is one and I just haven't unlocked it yet). I don't really have much to say about the sound effects. They're there.   I won't do my usual 'I liked/disliked this' sections since there's not much to say. I had fun. My heart raced, I cursed, and I'm not only glad this is on Steam, but I'm glad I gave this game a chance. It's short, but there's a little bit of replay value, and I can see myself giving this game a few more hours. I've forgotten what it's like to actually  have  to learn patterns and get penalized by starting boss fights over when I don't.",

            "review_text": "Ultionus: A Tale of Petty Revenge is a short sweet platformer game that everyone is gonna enjoy (well at least I hope so)  We play as Serena a space hero who is trolled by a galactic prince one day and it's up to you to go get some sweet revenge.  The game is split across 7 areas which you have to go through and fight a boss at the end of each one. Each area is alright for the most part, but I'll cover it a bit more later.   The game has some truly gorgeous pixel art and it's one of my favorite looking games to date. It brings me back to the days of playing the classic games I used to own. Everything looks top notch and if you like pixel art style you won't be dissapointed.  The soundtrack is also great and the end credits song is awesome as well. Whoever made that soundtrack deserves a pat on the back.  The game is also quite tought, but never unfair and that's what I truly liked about it. So if you don't like hand holding don't worry this game won't dissapoint you, but for those who want to experience this game without failing, the game also has a easy mode, which reduces the difficulty, but not by much.   The game also has a few things I didn't like about it.  First of all the controls are really slippery. Sometimes it's hard to makes jumps and shooting can be tricky once you are swarmed through every direction possible.   The game also locks away weapon upgrades to secrets. So if you miss one, the upcoming later might be harder, because you didn't get the upgrade you needed.  The game is also incredibly short. It took me 2 hours to finish, but this is just going through the story once. There is also multiple endings you can get, but there's only two of them.   Overall the game is really good and for the price you really can't go wrong.  Pros: + Amazing Art Style  + Great Soundtrack  +Decent Challenge  +Multiple Endings  Cons: - Too Short - Slippery Controls  Final Rating: 7.5/10 - Good  If you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked about this review.

I say SEGA Genesis because I really don't think SNES had any games showing off a provocative woman with big boobs like what you find here. :P Don't be fooled. This game is a lot of fun playing as a totally hot babe with a 'Pew Pew' gun, blasting alien creatures left and right. The game offers a pretty much retro action platform style with beautiful graphics and the controls are very easy to get used to. There is also a nice assortment of alien creatures to blast left and right. If you are into retro game then don't miss out on this. :)",

            "review_text": "Beautiful, vibrant pixel art and fleshed out backgrounds that seem to go back forever. Awesome monsters and huge-frantic boss battles. Every inch of screen is full of charm and polish. Excellent FM-Synthesis-esque soundtrack (reminds me of Later DOS games) really brings everything together.  The level design is straightforward, but there appears to be multiple paths.  The dev probably needs to work on conveying game mechanics a little better, as it stands there are some things that aren't ever made clear or even mentioned in game. I got an achievement for beating the game without upgrading, and I didn't even know I could upgrade! Additionally, there are some 'S' coins littered throughout the game that I still don't know what purpose they serve. I'd RTFM, if one was even included. The achievements menu seems to convey more about the smaller mechanics than the game does itself.  The game is pretty tough, you'll probably die a lot more than you think you would based on the screenshots. I felt like this arbitrarily increased the games lenth a bit.  That last point being key because the game is very, very short. 7 stages, as it says on the tin. I've only played on easy mode thus far, but my total game time from first boot to completion was 55 minutes. I assume higher difficulty levels will increase this dramatically as easy mode has infinite lives. I'll be going back into the game's normal mode momentarily.  That being said, the game's actual quality is top notch, it's a ton of fun to play and look at. I see a lot of concerns about the 'meme culture' in the trailer but rest assured it's mostly just for marketing purposes, I've yet to see any troll faces or anything of the sort in game. Only one Doge reference in the achievements menu, and I don't mind.  People afraid of or disgusted by images of well endowed women should already know this game isn't for them from the cover art. I for one, have no problem there. Looking in the forums however, it would appear that this portion of the game did not filter out a large quantity of progressive type people.  It's definitely worth a play. 7$ is a bit steep for a single playthrough, but multiple difficulty mode, good and bad engings and so on makes this 7$ well spent. Recommended.",

The controls seemed clunky and the game just doesn't feel responsive enough for the never-ending waves of respawning monsters - which is sad, 'cause it seems like a cool game with diverse levels, shmup-parts and neat art design (not to mention Serena S sports some impressive character, if you know what I mean). If you're into retro (and by retro in this context I mean trashy old games that have flaws but also character) - give it a try.  Buy in sale or regret it.",

Influenced by the 80's computer game Phantis, the graphics is simply gorgeous! The chiptune music is well done and fits perfectly with the action. The controls is very good and with a controller, it felt like a console worthy game.   This game is short but the difficulty makes up for it. The replay value is also very high with secret branching paths, good and bad endings, harder difficulty levels and achievevents to take on.

            "review_text": "People complaining about this game feeling unresponsive must not have liked the original Castlevania or Metroid much. You lock in place when you attack, making it a commitment to fire. All this means is that you have to think about your actions before taking it. The level design is mostly set up in such a way that when you encounter a new kind of enemy or obstacle you have the means to observe it safely before engaging with it and then it'll be mixed into the standard array of things you'll be fighting, which is the smart way to do things. The game is about as monotonous as the original Metroid in terms of dealing with a lot of the same enemy, but it's a lot more linear, with a sort of Metal Slug like level design, which might feel a little dull since the reason Metroid is kind of monotonous for a first player is because you're exploring, whereas this will always have you trawling through a bunch of the same foe that's barely worth fighting. Jake Kaufman is a fantastic composer and I don't feel like I even need to describe that the music is both interesting by itself and fitting within the context of the game. Ultionus may not feel like anything new but if you're looking for something that feels like an old SNES game or a cabinet game I recommend picking it up.",

EDIT: Alright, alright. Since the original review was published i've gone and troubleshooted my way about the game. What seems to be the problem is that the engine used for this game just doesn't care for particular controllers and their drivers, mine in question is MotioninJoy and better DS3. Whenever I try to switch over to those the game plummets to the 5 FPS as previously mentioned, on keyboard it stays at the constant 30 fps as designed.  The gameplay is similar to all the games it mentions and is a beautiful labor of love. The music is fantastic and it has a 'classic' level of difficulty, that being that it's rediciously hard. If you are a fan of those types of games this one is no different, and if this game were to magically be brought to the past and played exactly how it is in the late 80s and early 90s it'd be considered one of the best of the genre.  Sadly it is not the 80s and 90s anymore.",
