            "review_text": "Recommended.  The plot of this game isn't really anything new; rescue a person and save the world from destruction. Most HOGs are like that, but I still liked it either way. Even if the story is typical, the game is still enjoyable. I can't really say more without spoilers, so I'll just leave it at that.   The visuals are definitely what drew me to this game. They are beautiful, both colorful and haunting, which I think they're supposed to be since it's Dark and Carnival. The cut scenes were okay and didn't stand out to me, except for one character's eyes were kind of scary because I didn't almost see his irises at all. I do think that the animation is a bit clumsy somehow, maybe the characters' movements are jerky?  Even though it's a hidden object game, first and foremost, I prefer minigames and puzzles about these games and there were a lot of different ones. I wouldn't say they are anything new, but still good nonetheless. One minigame annoyed me, so I skipped it. (And lost a chance to get one achievement...) Hidden object scenes are not particularly hard and since you visit one scene at least once, it gets easy to remember where you saw and what. Also, I liked my little monkey helper Miles.  If I have to say one thing that I didn't like, is the fact that you have to play this game twice (and once on Expert Mode) to get all the achievements. Even if I liked the game, I don't want to have to play the whole game again (at least not immediately) just to get the rest of the achievements.  This is yet another game I owned a physical copy of, so I knew what I was getting when I bought it. I liked the story (especially after I finished the game), the puzzles and pretty locations, and my monkey helper. It took me 2,5 hours to finish the whole game (but not all achievements), so it's not very long. I bought this on sale, but I think it's worth the full price.",

            "review_text": "I bought this as I got a 50% off coupon. It's a point and click puzzle game.   I played straight through in 4 hours and found it just challenging enough to keep my focus.  Some people have commented about the puzzles being too easy, well some, but the later puzzles did hold me up at times.   I personally enjoyed the spirit of the game and it being just easy enough not to make me feel like an idiot. Nothing worse than spending 2 hours on a puzzle you just can't get your head around.   I will be moving onto Nightmare From The Dark Series which reportedly has more difficult puzzles but as I'm just getting into these type of games I found this just perfect.   P.S I'm 28 years old I honestly couldn't give a toss about the storyline in this game which was good by the way, just not for someone my age. If it required much more than basal attention I wouldn't have bothered playing it all the way through - it's for kids, luckily the puzzles are just hard enough for an adult",

            "review_text": "Once again a great HOG by Artifex Mundi arrived on Steam. The protagonist is a detective that must rescue a woman who disappeared in a strange carnival. This time I noticed that other languages are better translated (like Italian) so it's easier to do HOG scenes in my mother tongue, but there are some mistakes (it's hard finding an object in a HOG scene if the name is so badly translated that you can't recognize it) so for now it's better playing in English. The scenery is beautyful as usual and the extra chapter after the main adventure is a nice bonus. If you still haven't played a HOG (really???) this game is perfect to get a new addiction.",

            "review_text": "Not Artifex Mundi's best effort. I am a big fan of their previous outings (see my reviews), but this one left much to be desired. Even on expert mode, it was far too easy and incredibly straightforward. It's quite a shame given that their track record is typically very good, but I guess they can't all be amazing works.  Dark Arcana is standard Mundi fare with HOGs sandwiched between various puzzles and item fetches. There's nothing you don't expect in here and naturally, the creepy character models make a triumphant return. Oddly, the fortune teller is animated very differently with classic 'open mouth' animation whereas other characters speak with typical mouth-morphing 'lip sync'. At any rate, not that we play these games for story, this one is a bit of a stinker, imo, but more importantly, the puzzles make absolutely no sense. Granted, in a Mundi game, many puzzles are somewhat out of place in the way you wonder why the police station in Raccoon City is so ridiculously push-blocky. However, here, there just seems to be a disconnect, moreso than in other Mundi games, and I felt that Dark Arcana was phoned in; even the items in the HOGs don't randomize like they usually do. What gives?  Finally, the HOG minigame alternative this time is Monaco, a weird match-two game where choosing cards in a row, a column, or diagonally will determine which way the remaining ones shift. It's largely unfun and keep in mind that I despise shanghai/mahjong when I say this - I would rather play shanghai/mahjong.  Anyways, if you have a choice of Mundi games, I would choose another one, but this one will keep you occupied for a couple of hours. I wouldn't recommend it at the $10 price point, but if it's in a bundle, might as well grab some achievements.",

            "review_text": "It's true, it's short, but it has plenty of interesting puzzles (mini games they call it in-game), which is what I play these games for. (If anyone knows games where you just get the puzzles, no story, no hidden objects, let me know.)  As to the rest, the images (scenes) are pleasant, the hidden object games and story are nice (and as mentioned, I don't actually play this for them), the alternative to the hidden object games is interesting too (though it took me a bit to realize that column, symbol, and row wouldn't remove objects, but cards in the Monaco game).  It was entertaining enough to play through 3 times, to complete the achievements. (First time I alternated between HO/Monaco a few times, so be sure I got them all, I did the expert mode right after the first play-through, with only Monaco, and another easy play-through for HO.) I would have liked to be able to complete the achievements by doing the HO and Monaco in the Extras, sadly that didn't work. (Or I just tried the wrong ones?)  Can't say anything about the music. There are few games where I don't turn it off first thing.  Overall, some hours spent in an entertaining manner. I got the game on sale for 1.99 euro, and if you're not as uber stingy as I, it could well be worth twice that. (Not sure about full price - it is a bit short.)  Going to buy the other HO games the developers made (those I don't already have).",

            "review_text": "'Dark Arcana: The Carnival' is a decent Artifex Mundi casual adventure Hiddend Object Game (HOG). Unfortunately, it's one of their less recent ones. So, it will require at least two runthroughs to get 100% Achievements (and if you mess up part way through a run, you can't quit and start over -- you'll have to finish the game you started before restarting). The story and voice acting are decent (well, for a HOG), and the graphics and puzzles are fine. I did notice quite a few more blatant language issues in the HOGs though. Three of the most egregious are 1) a record is not a plate, a fan is not a windmill, and the golden mask of King Tut is not a sphinx. The only other negative I can come up with is that the storyline in the Bonus Chapter is, in a word, dumb.  It took me 3.6 hours to finish my first run of the main game, another 0.7 hours for the Bonus Chapter, and then another 2.1 hours for my second run of the main game to get 100% Achievements. That's 6.4 hours of decent game play. So, I'm recommending the game. But, I'd also recommend finding it on sale for something close to $5.",

I loved the little touches like the ghost people watching you as you walk around the dark carnival. The carousal was one of my favorites, I wish they had done more with it than just being essentially eye-candy. The art and setting is the only reason I would recommend this game.  The puzzles are far too easy, the hidden object portions are so easy it takes only a couple minutes to plow through each one. The story is rather generic and only so-so writing. In the 5 HOG games I have played I finished this one fastest (because it was so easy!) and yes I was playing on expert anything else would have been a joke.",

            "review_text": "Dark Arcana: The Carnival is a pretty decent HOG game. It has the usual silly supernatural-romance/horror sort of plot which rolls along at a good clip. There are plenty of HO screens -- they  do  repeat, but without respawning the items you collected the previous time, which makes the revisit to the now less-cluttered screen less of an annoyance and more of a gratifying victory lap.  Like some other games, this one offers the option to bail out of the HO screens by playing a mini-game instead; this one a card-matching game called 'Monaco'. I've never quite understood  why  anyone would start up a hidden-object game and then opt to play a boring minigame to avoid having to find hidden objects, but the option is there. The option was useful at one point where an evident switch of image descriptions had a plate described as a record (and vice versa, in a later screen). Also, if you're achievement-hunting, you'll need to leave at least one hidden object unfound on each screen, and get it by playing 'Monaco' instead, as three achievements are earned through the card game.  Finally, don't be afraid of the 'Expert' difficulty setting here. This game, like the other Artifex Mundi offerings I've tried, leans to the easy end of the scale. Because of the low difficulty, it goes pretty quickly, but there's a good-sized helping of content, so you should get three hours or so of gameplay, including the bonus chapter. If you play on Expert and remember to always use 'Monaco' to finish off each HO screen, it should be possible to get every achievement in one playthrough.",
