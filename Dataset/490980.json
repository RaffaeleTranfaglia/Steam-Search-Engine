            "review_text": "This is the kind of game I wish I could like more and recommend to others, but with Daily Chthonicle I honestly can't do either. Let's look into why that's the case and whether I'm maybe missing something in the process.  I have to admit I like the premise. A lot. You run a newspapers agency and send your reporters to cover events across town. Now, as fate and title of the game would have it those usually happen to be oddities and other Lovecraft-inspired scenarios as you tackle them head-on and cover the news in order to get to the bottom of it all for your readers. Getting further into detail I'm talking about things where, for example, the initial mystery is “number of people have visited a certain island, some of them are now dead upon returning home” which at the end of the investigation might turn out to have been the result of a zombie plague they brought back with them or something else equally mundane. I say “mundane” because there are also mysteries which may result in dangerous outcomes such as Old Ones' spawns manifesting or trying to, which will require an extremely well-prepared individuals to deal with... and just might cause a power shortage in the entire city as your battle goes on. These are the highlights of the game and usually used sparingly.  Speaking of preparedness – you have your trusty reporters, but they're more akin to RPG-lite characters with innate classes, so to speak, and whom you also get to develop over the course of the game if they don't go crazy or too injured because you lack funds to treat them. Aside from their default gear and skill kits, you can lend them weapons, gear, potions, etc for temporary use if you deem the situation dangerous enough. This is kinda where one of my problems with the game rears its ugly head in a sense that there's little comparative value between items. Oh sure, game disables firearms as a potential choice if you're facing something intangible, but what's the difference between the Holy Bible and Tarot cards in such a case? Whiskey or trusty dog companion for general pep boost? Item classes work just fine, but there appears to be no overt mechanical differentiation between respective items within those classes so you're usually left to your own devices and that isn't always reliable. Said items can be bought from local city districts and potions brewed if you've gathered enough ingredients so it's worthwhile to invest intelligently and have someone on lab duty. I should point out you make money by releasing your regular issues at 2AM and 2PM, but these won't make you much money compared to Special Editions which follow after you solve three cases through and through. These also signify the end of chapters.  Which brings me to the story. Or what passes for story because game employs generated storylines but it really comes off as bare-bones skeleton where actual story should've been hanged upon. Don't get me wrong because I do like the systems, but once you see most of the permutations and understand how game logic works you begun to just skip through, There's also no story summary after you solve cases or publish Special Editions as much as just a listing of steps your investigators went through to get there. It's very dry and obviously intended to be taken in through game's atmosphere and dread scenarios are meant to cause in you, but for me it just didn't work. Your characters could've also benefited from some identity, but aside from maybe being affected by events on chapter changes they're just tools in your hands.  In the end it's a game you'll have fun with early on before it becomes obvious it repeats content by necessity and it all kinda blends together. Like I said, it's a shame and I hope developers get another crack at the idea.",
