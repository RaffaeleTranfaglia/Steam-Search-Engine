            "review_text": "It's not a good RPG, but it's not a total catastrophe either... The item and level grinding is boring, it lacks in story and especially in side quests and the level 'design' is pretty much non-existant. Most of the game looks more random than Diablo while it isn't. While the game isn't a complete waste of time and has some moments, the lack of speech for the few NPCs, the mindnumbing and pointless arena fights and a lot of other small details make the game very dull and sometimes tedious to play. There's just so many better Diablo clones around and this one is hardly worth anybody's time. The final battle is a joke compared to the other boss fights. So many design flaws in one game that it's almost a candidate for a rotten tomato award... Unless you're extremely bored and have nothing better to play, stay away from this game.",

The UI was clunky, the animations seemed worse and the game itself felt forced and unpolished. I'll never know what promise it might have had because I could only force myself to sit through about an Hour of the game. And I'm one of those gamers who will think nothing of dropping 20 hours into a game to follow a good story or explore an intresting world. This game sadly, was a total disapointment.",

            "review_text": "Numen: Contest of Heroes is a surprisingly robust RPG, with attractive 3D graphics, well animated if not particularly innovative enemies, and minimalist but adequate sound design. The game features a leveling system similar to the orginal Dugeon Siege where using a particular attack type, whether melee, magic or ranged will make your character gradually progress in that specialization. The system is well implemented here and the result is a game that comes across as a nice hyrbid of the setting from Titan Quest and the gameplay mechanics of Dungeon Siege. Both widescreen and Steam Overlay are supported, but unfortunately the Xbox 360 controller is not. I would recommend this game to anyone interested in the RPG genre.",

I spent over half the time I played it walking around trying to find something to do... when I ran out of obvious stuff I could do going from island to island... I turned it off.",
