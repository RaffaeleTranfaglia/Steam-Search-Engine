            "review_text": "I wan't sure that I would like this controller game, becuase in VR everything else is standing and running around. It turns out that I like sitting and playing VR even better!   This game is like an arcade racer, where you see the entire track layed out before you and it seems to take up your entire room. You can get up and walk around the track, is down in the infield and watch the cars race around, its pretty cool.   The AI is pretty good, while at first it was too easy, I just changed the difficulty to hard and after I did that, the races were super challenging. There is a mutliplayer option as well, but I did not spend any time playing that yet, ive mostly just played single player.",

            "review_text": "The driving and drifting mechanics are fun but lack depth. The physics are fun for turning but the braking and understeering punishment seems harsh. I'm a fan of drift culture but this is short lived. It feels like sound effects are missing and some solid progression.   The physics are fun and so is driving the cars but it will get stale very fast. The game feels a bit empty. I hope they add more features, UI elements, sound effects, and I would love a POV camera just for fun.",
