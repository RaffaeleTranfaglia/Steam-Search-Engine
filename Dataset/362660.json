            "review_text": "A very nice and touching game. In short, it is a story telling how love, fate and a bit of magic can bring a miracle into one's life :) The characters are different and very well developed - their behaviour and actions are logical and follow the main line and your choices.  The only thing I would like to point out is that I can't call this game a 'dating sim' (unlike of what I thought at first look). The game has only two-three kiss scenes - not even one per route. But it does have a great story during which our heroine develop different kinds of relationships with other characters. And if she ends up with one of them, then it is what will truly bring her happiness.  Recommended to be bought if you are into visual novels.",

            "review_text": "As I finally got through getting all of the endings, achievements, etc., for Blue Rose, I thought it would be time to convey my opinion of it. Being a fan of visual novels, I think I have a pretty good sense of which ones are good versus which ones should be passed over.  Now this game has gotten mixed reviews since it has been released on Steam and I can see why. I'll give this a positive rating since I liked the game more although I did find flaws in it. But on to the review. XD  The story-I liked the overall idea of what Blue Rose was trying to convey in that in a war, it's not always easy to choose one side or the other. Sometimes, there are gray areas and people choose the path that others do not expect them to. However, I think this idea could have been better fleshed out. Without giving away major spoilers, I think that if the romanceable option that Lena, the playable character, pursues were to explain his/her reasons for not wanting to be involved in the war that the game creates, then that would make things clearer. This does get explained when the paths are split but the paths are split after a supposed major conflict is over. However, in my opinion, I think the explanation would have been better placed before that major event happens.  Now on to the paths, there were some that I liked more than others. My favorite path would definitely be Aran's and I feel like his path is a true path. It explains why certain events happened in the game and all and how the conflicts can be resolved and does so without it feeling dragged out. My second favorite path would have to be Gavin's but that's because I liked what happens near the end of his good path. I won't say more since that would reveal major spoilers. XD My least favorite would probably be Erin's because I feel that the events aren't as action-filled and that her path feels dragged out.   I liked the art and the CGs and the music was pretty good so no complaints there. The only other complaint I'd have to make (and I'm sure that this has been brought up by others) is that there were quite a lot of typos and grammar errors. I don't know if this game was proofread (it probably was) and I know how difficult it can be finding all of the errors but there were quite a lot and I think this game could use some additional polishing in that respect. It would make reading the text smoother. I would suggest some editing of the content as well but at the very least, one additional run at proofreading should be made so that it looks as professional as can be.  Overall, I think Blue Rose has the potential to be a good game and that's why my rating will be positive despite the criticism I just gave. I hope that the developer will take my opinion into account, as I look forward to any future games. ^^",

            "review_text": "Said first: Ignore those less than 1hour playtime, i played/read parts of the Novel in offlinemode on an old laptop on Vacation.  I finished the Simonroute so far, once i decide to read the other ones I will refresh this review.  Whoever thinks this Novel will have gamefeatures due to the 'action'/'rpg' taggs it got.... it hasn't it's just a generic VN  Blue Rose is a surprisingly well written and can be considdered a hidden gem (but still not perfect Novel) as it's none of the 'overhyped' steam VNs anyone hates or cares about.  I can only talk from the Simonroute right now, but I found the Ending to be a bit over the top...   *smallspoiler do not read the next paragraph if you wanna play it completely blind*   I mean... first defeating the Dragon only to go to the endboss right away without any real breake... that sounds incredibly forced.. the reappearance of the Dragon was NOT necessary. Other than that the Route/Game was realy entertaining and actionpacked.  Pro: Good Music Good Story Nice Backgrounds Many choices, no '1choice only' Novel Achievements Cards   Con: Charactersprites look mostly dull, this is common for VN maker tools, it's no AAA Novel so it's k Forced amazement on Simonroute /possibly other Routes aswell Partly Englishtranslation is still lacking polishing even though it got fixxed numerous times Pricetag: I know Novels are usually expensive, but for a VN Maker Novel 20€ is too high   All in all: The pricetagg is high which makes it a 'buy only on Bundle or on Sale' deal  Overall this Novelgame was realy good besides the generic VN Maker problems. 7/10 for starters  Readingtime 1 Route: ~3 Hours",

            "review_text": "This is probably one of my favorite visual novels. That being said I have a lot of complaints. Here we go: + Story - finally story that touches more mature/darker themes. + Setting of the game, secluded village is nice idea, and I like time period as well. + Romance - we don’t need so much dating simulators and I am really pleased that romance is finally secondary objective in one Visual Novel. It feels mature as well, there isn’t cringe worthy elements like in most VNs.  + Writing - I liked that I could love or hate a character depending on which path I took. +/- Choices - decent variety of endings or love interests but I sometimes wasn't satisfied with choices game made for me. +/- Music - it felt like decent choice but nothing I will want to hear again. - Visual aspects of the game – I didn’t like almost any of it, I don’t find any character appealing, and while some of the scenery is decent I would like it to complement description better, I want to see those changes on the mountain I’ve read so many times. - Price - I bought it in a bundle and I am very satisfied with the game but I can't recommend it for this price. If it’s on sale for 70% off or more you should consider it. - That I couldn't skip text that I’ve already read in the endgame. It's annoying and it artificially adds length to the game which is bad thing.",
