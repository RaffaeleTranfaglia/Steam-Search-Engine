Those who grew up lost within the Underground Empire of  Zork  or  Choose Your Adventure  novels will instantly feel at home here. The storyline has branching options but most will lead toward doom. Few options reward the player. Instead, every choice carries the gravity of possible death behind it. The atmosphere is oppressive and intriguing.  Disturbed  is FREE and well worth taking for a quick spin. Just do not expect to breeze through it without the trail-and-error experimentation of bygone eras.",

It's text based so you do need to pay attention to what you are reading and doing. In this game you should save often because you will die and have to start over again. It's not bad for a free game, it's not really horror but it is fun. Try it, it's free. 7/10",

The events are fixed per scene so once you figure it out then you know to avoid it or to trying to fit it in properly in the sequence of events. It takes about an hour to beat.  I found the game fairly mediocre overall, but decided on giving an upvote since it is free. I was not a huge fan of the art, but that is a matter of personal taste. I also found there was not enough variety in the scenes, with the story too linear. First decision A or B; try A, die, so restart and choose B; next decision C or D; choose C; die; so start again, choose B, then D, etc. It is very linear and you basically go from scene to scene and trial and error. After you are a number of choices in, you have to repeat a lot of scenes just so you can arbitrarily die in some decision.  I see this as a poor man's version of 'The Forest of Doom.' Very similar plot of being in a forest, but much nicer graphics, better decision tree, but costs about $2 on sale.   Another free alternative to this game is 'The Bottom of the Well' - a grim adventure tale, but where the story is actually very interesting and complex.",

Looking forward to more like this in the future. Pro +  + Beautiful in a twisted disturbed way.  + The quick save feature is AMAZING.  Con -  - If you can't commit to a little bit of story and puzzle-solving, you might want to give this a pass.  - Not for those who rage quit with a high death rate.  I would definitely recommend this game to people who are fans of text based fantasy games, a little bit of dark humour and those who appreciate a bit of the darker art styles around.  Give it a go. It's short, sweet and dare I say it, deathly good.",

I think if it was polished and the creator maybe focused on the story and the choices the player can make it would be a better game. i played for 10 minutes and just got annoyed for dying without any reason every ten seconds.",
