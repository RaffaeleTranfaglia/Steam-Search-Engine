            "review_text": "Ronin is a very fun game but many people may have huge faults with the game.   First of all there is really no story at all in the game, there is small bits but overall there is nothing to call a story. So instead of gunpoint where you know why you are going in and doing the this job, you just kill random people to get data to kill a boss character. Sadly we don't even know anything about our character...you can assume who she is in the picture but that is it. On a side note i want to know about the 2 guys other then the assume dad and the normal ninja guy in the picture, i want to know why we don't kill them.  Gameplay it is very fun and enjoyable. Yes there is many bugs where you teleport around but it happened when i screwed up already, but i see how it could be a huge problem. Luckly there is checkpoints every 3 minutes so really the glitches are small 'aww i got to kill these 2 people again' then doing a whole level again. I feel sad that the game is only 4 ish hours long, well 8 counting NG+ but overall a very short game.  Music i really did enjoy and liked listening to, it fit the action of the scene and always nice to have some heartpumping action music while you slow down time and kill 5 people in a room. You can see this as a bad thing but to me the music was one of the best parts of the game in my mind.  The last thing is NG+. Now i did find it interesting that they change one enemy's attack which made the game harder and the obvious more guys in a room. Weirdly i found the game easier in NG+....with all the abilities i had and how easier to get the abilities i just found it easier. The only time i had huge troubles was the final guy where i had to do a certain pattern to beat him, but overall i wished there was more put into NG+.  Basically i had fun and found it enjoyable. I feel like gunpoint is better then this, but i had more heartpumping moments in this. If i have to give this a rating, i give it a 7.5, there is huge problems with glitchs and the fact no story makes you sometimes go 'why am i even killing this guy?'. Not the best game in the genre but a fun game to play",

            "review_text": "Purchased via a humble bundle, so no refund in my future. But this game had a great idea - turn based action, dodging according to sight lines, planning out encounters - and really sank it all by being very fiddly and unpredictable. This game really should have had more playtesting and care put into designing areas, encounters and the basic platforming. What became the breaking point between 'this is kind of aggravating' and 'this game deserves a bad review' is the in-level tip, that 'The jump arc is a lie.'  That really brings home all the problems. When it's about precise attack dodging and knocking down enemies, doing little frog hops instead of leaping into someone aiming a gun at you means resetting. Trying to jump onto someone near a ledge sometimes means knocking in just underneath it, and there's no helping you if all you need to do is go up instead of jumping around aimlessly to do a simple climb. The jump arc is essential to playing the game, but is unreliable and frustrating; that's not funny, that's just poor design.",

            "review_text": "Ronin is a game that seems to have aped half the code from Gunpoint and added a single original gimmick. The gimmick is this turn-based combat system that has you jumping around from place to place, trying to avoid gunfire so that you can get up close to stab your enemies with a sword. When it works, it's pretty brilliant. It's a good mechanic, but it lacks polish, and when your one original idea comes with serious bugs, it ruins the entire game. The big issue is that this jumping ballet requires extreme precision, and very tactical thought, as a single mistake will see you dead, and so when the game tells you your jump is going to land you in a certain area, you need to be able to trust with 100% certainty that you will land where expected, else you are likely to die. The problem is that a decent percentage of the time, the game will screw up your trajectory just enough to get you killed, and see you frustratingly replay the same section over and over and over again.  Worse is when the game decides abruptly, and for very little reason, to suddenly drop you out of the turn-based play, and back into real time. If an enemy spots you but you're too far away to attack, they will call in a Lockdown, which can screw up your progress, or cause automatic failure of the level. It takes them 9 turns, or 9 seconds, to initiate the lockdown, giving you 9 turns, or 9 seconds, to reach them and stop them from putting through the call. 9 turns is difficult enough in some of the particularly dangerous levels, where there are a dozen enemies around you, all trying to shoot you dead every turn. When the game suddenly drops you into real-time mode, you can suddenly lose 2-3 seconds before you even realize what's happened, and now you've gone from 8 turns to 5 turns through no fault of your own.  The game can easily be beaten in less than 4 hours, if you're decent at it and the game doesn't screw up repeatedly and cause you to have to replay sections of the game again and again and again. Two sections in particular, which should have been 5 minute sections to beat, took me over 90 minutes to beat because I kept dying. Sometimes it was my own fault, the game can be a challenge even when it's working flawlessly, which is a good thing, but a good chunk of the time I died because the game didn't do what it said it'd do, and got me killed as a result.  Bottom line: The game is reasonably fun, but I'd wait for it to go on a massive sale. Even at the entirely reasonable $10-13 dollar range it just doesn't feel like enough game, and the bugginess can really hurt the fun. If you can get it for $5, and don't mind some frustration, there's a fairly decent game here.",

            "review_text": "I enjoyed almost all of Ronin, the mechanics are interesting (if a little unpredictable at times) and completing the levels while still trying to get all the objectives makes for some enjoyable puzzle-y stabby action. Plotting your route through the levels and trying to pick off as many enemies as possible before the inevitable fire fight is fun enough to make this a certain positive recommendation.  BUT. The decision to design the last level without a single checkpoint is so staggeringly idiotic that it makes me want to scream. All enjoyment is sucked out of trying to solve the puzzles it presents because any attempt at experimentation is punished with having to play the first half of the level all over again. And now, right at the end of the game that element of unpredictability (will that jump work as the trajectory suggests? Will I clip an enemy on the way past? Will that guard hit me or will I fly through the gap unscathed?) crashes into your living room and punches you repeatedly in the balls. The first half of the level is not so good that I want to replay it a billion times just to get to the later sections.  I appreciate that this is ameliorated slightly by a new mechanic and it (sort of) plays into the storyline but I fail to see how that is an improvement over having a sensible checkpoint system which would let the player choose how they want to approach it.  Do not buy this, do not support this kind of design decision.",

Yet it's far from flawless; a lot of wall-collision bugs, a few game design mistakes make it next to impossible to clear with a controller on NG+, (mouse and keyboard mandatory on NG+). The game is also a bit too short and there's a good replay value only for 'meta'-completionists, ie : being able to set goals and challenges for yourself. (for instance I've been making time attack runs with or w/o wall-bug)  If these few flaws don't bother you or if you find it in a bundle then by all means buy it ! It has a lot of interesting and original gameplay mechanics, its hybrid turnbased/realtime gameplay makes it something unique and very fun to experiment with.  Also very nice music by Patryk Karwat.

The checkpoint system is VERY generous, so there aren't any extreme aspects to this game other than some difficult encounters here and there.  One of the most favorite things I liked was that you get to freely decide how to deal with enemies and not being restricted to follow a script, allowing a very dynamic gameplay. As you keep playing you'll earn more skills to spice up the game, and for the challengers among you - there is NG+ which provides even more intense setting.  You can probably count the turn based games I ever played on one hand, and I can only wish future turn based games will give me as much satisfaction as this did.",

Artistically it looks like Gunpoint, which I loved, but that is about the extent of the similarities between the two.  My biggest gripe with the game has to do with the controls. A game like this needs tight controls and I feel like this game does not have it. There have been plenty of occasions when trying to jump in combat the trajectory says I will clear certain obstactles but when I carry out said action my character only slides forward and inch or so leading to my death. Also other times it seems that on a second attemot I will perform the same set of actions but the npcs will act entirely differently.  There are other concerns about the game but I don't want to go into some long rant about all of the problems I see.

It's a lot of fun.  Unfortunately, it's eventually let down by the imprecise controls, which are not nearly tight or capable enough to handle things from the fourth level boss on.

The gameplay works but in my opinion the game design has some flaws. For example the skills you unlock. You can only use them, when you use a form of combo which is stupid in my opinion. Also the AI is too picky for me. But all of this would be ok if this had not been so repetetive. You arrive at a level. You need to hack computers, engage in some combat, hack another computer, engage in combat again. Then you leave and have to get to your motorbike WHICH IS IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF ARRIVAL.

That's bloody ridiculous. It's damn near impossible to do without raising the alarm. There are guys bloody everywhere  (EDIT AGAIN) I did it",

The art style and music was nice but I couldn't appreciate it's full potential because of the alarming problems.   When I bought the game I thought it would be a Gunpoint or Mark of The Ninja with a twist. I was left with a game where the main challenge was trying not to fall through the floor.  5/10 ",

I've seen some gripes that this shouldn't be considered a stealth game and I agree... if you either play the game fast and loose or are just bad at staying out of sight. It IS a stealth game if you stay out of sight lines (literal, red sight lines) and know what order to take targets out in. Regardless of what genre it's considered, I've greatly enjoyed it. It does get a bit frustrating when, for instance, someone starts calling in a lockdown that shouldn't have been able to see/hear you or when you go to jump down to a lower platform/floor and you just jump a molecule forward (usually getting killed because of this). The menu also seems to 'lag' a bit at times. Other than that, it's a great game. However, I wouldn't pay $12.99 for this. $4.99 - $9.99 would have been a better price range, so you might want to wait for a sale. $12.99 isn't, by an means, highway robbery, but it feels a bit salty to me (and why I waited for a bundle/sale).
