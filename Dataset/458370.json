The experience is very comfortable with no sudden movements. Knocking one out of the park always gets a smile. There are fun options like hitting a beach ball and tennis ball. Everyone who's played seems to have a different swinging style - you can use one or two hands, and people really get into it. This is one where you just might want to put on the wrist straps!",

A great way to share a headset with a few people over to pass around the headset for short games. At first I thought I didn't have enough room for it (I have a tight space right now) and then realized I could hit the menu button to adjust the plate and make better use of my space. Definitely recommend for some quick fun!",
