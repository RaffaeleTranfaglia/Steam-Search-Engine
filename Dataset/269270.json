Love is an indenependently developed platforming game, made by Fred Wood. It contains 16 levels, 7 'remix' levels and speedrun mode among other features. The game currently stands at Very Positive with 90%. It uses retro-styled graphics and has a semi-futuristic soundtrack. Love tries to be a game which can be easy for beginners, but challenging for veterans. Does it succeed? Yes, it does. It accomplishes this task through the different modes it has. These include, Easy, Arcade, Yolo, Speedrun and Remix mode. Easy allows new players to play until they get the feel for the game, before moving onto playing Arcade or Speedrun, and then if you're really good; you should be able to complete Yolo mode.

If i had to be nit picky, the arcade 'lives' system is a bit outdated and the ability to save between play throughs would have been nice...  ESPECIALLY SINCE...  This game honestly gave me motion sickness...the way the camera works is a little sickening and can really throw you off your game. So not being able to save and come back to your run...Yeah that sucks a little.   BUT  For 65p. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.   Money finally bought love and she abused me again and again...and again and again i forgave her and...yeah its 65p/£1.99 just play the game.",

There are several other modes available for those competitive completionist schmucks such as a one-life mode and a speedrun mode.  Not a whole lot to the game.

I didn't find any of the songs stuck in my head I found them floating in one ear and out the other. There was one level when the music was so....I don't think I should say 'bad' but I wanted to finish the level so I wouldn't have to hear the music! The levels are hard! I found myself dead at least 300 times. Overall if you want a game that is short tand is a platformer. This is for you.",

You play a character which is a few blocks tall and wide, and to complete the game, you must brave this character through the many levels in which this game has to offer.  All of the levels in Love can vary in terms of difficulty, ranging from a few blocks to jump over, to dissapearing platforms which stay on the level for only a few seconds. Anyone who can complete the game (which, by the way doesn't take that long) has achieved something.  There is a variation of game-modes in which you can choose from, from 'Easy Mode', to 'YOLO Mode' this game can keep you busy for hours. No matter what mode or difficulty you play this game on, Love never ceases to grasp &amp; hold the unique atmosphere of the game. Which is why I like it.  How this game manages to do this is the distinctable level design and the soundtrack, which is absolutely fantastic.  If you enjoy platforming games, or are looking for some neat singleplayer games to keep you from your boredom, take a look at Love.",

The game is kinda on the short side but thats not bad and this game is actually quite fun and i would suggest you to play through it at least once. Now for the good things. The game is pretty fun but at the same time challenging. The game has an amazing soundtrack which is great to hear once you jump throught the game. Graphics looks amazing for a pixel like game. Now for the bad. The game is incredibly short you can pretty much finish the game in half an hour. Some minor bugs like getting stuck in the enviroments. But thats pretty much it. Overall this game is incredibly fun and i would suggest all of you to play Love. I give Love a 7.5/10",

Well, when two people have certain feelings towards each other, they...what, that isn't the topic either?...  ...oh, the GAME! Right...  Love is excellent. Fun, hard and forgiving at the same time. A retro-graphics platformer. (retro being pixels. HARD pixels. The bottom soil of the old era.) A playthrough is shorter than the love-kind-relationship that your dog and your guinea pig used to have, but it sounds better and is more fun, and doesn't destroy your furniture.  It has several game modes, one being the easy (e.g. cheap and no one plays it anyway) mode that gives you unlimited lives (yay, games!) but also a smaller score upon completion. Normal gives you 100 lives and you will get the normal (duh) scoring, depending on how many lives you have, how many spawnpoints you have set (YES YOU CAN SET THEM YOURSELF OMGSLJDESFS) and how fast you were - tons of replay potential.  For the upcoming sadists, there is a YOLO Mode. Yes, it is called like that. Die once and it is over. Pure madness.  And a speedrun mode, which arguably is the most fun mode because you can just get faster and faster and the game is visibly designed around improving your times and erasing mistakes and getting faster. Sonic would be proud, right before the spikes would bury themselves in his soft little fur. Just like your dogs teeth in your guinea pig.  But anyway, I am in love with love. It is a lovely loveable game. And you will love it too if you like tough as nails but fair platformers and highscores, and if you like to work on your mistakes.  I am out.  ",

            "review_text": "When a game is rather short and doesn't have a story, an endboss or any RPG aspects to make your character stronger the more you play, WHY would anyone repeatedly play it after their first play-through?  Because you realize that it is carefully designed in a way that, instead of getting bored or frustrated or annoyed, you quickly get better at it with every try and that's alot of fun, THAT'S WHY. There is no randomness, the game world stays the same with every run, but YOU make all the difference.   The game manages to incite eagerness to see how far you can beat your previous score, or reach the C, B or even A++ grade in the final summary screen, or climb through the ranks of the leaderboard, or beat the 12-minute speedrun achievement. This game is about your playing through the game, and it doesn't try to be about anything else, and from that perspective the minimalism of the game's presentation is completely appropriate and even helpful.",

Another great element of the game is the soundtrack, always entartaining and fit for guiding you trough the various stages. The game isn't that hard not long so it can be completed in around 1-2 hours, however extra modes (like a time challenge or no-death mode) can make it pretty long and hard to beat if you are looking to 100% it.",

Until they fix it (if they do), I don't recommend using the Steam controller with this game.",
