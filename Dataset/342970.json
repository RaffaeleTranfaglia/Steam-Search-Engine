            "review_text": "While this game tries to add some uniqueness to the village-building gameplay, the super low-res graphics and clunky UI make it almost unplayable for me. The fact that it was inexpensive helps, but games like Banished trump this in every possible way. You have a lot less control than you may believe, and you are helplessly at the mercy of your brain-dead citizens. Although I didn't play this long, I can't recommend.  PROS + Unique ability to expand world landmass as you acquire resources + Lots of resources to collect, buildings to erect, and items to create + Inexpensive  CONS - Low quality graphics and ugly UI mar the experience - Settler AI is often baffling - Other games achieve this formula so much better",

            "review_text": "This game has a lot of potential, but isn't quite there yet. The tutorial is buggy and resets before you're finished, and was written by someone without a solid grasp on the english language. The mouse click isn't where it is poiting, and though you can afford it doesn't always place when you click. There need to be significant balancing going on, had one game where my villagers got a plague and all died because the library to research a shaman is ungodly expensive.  It's not expensive, and if you have the patience this could be a cheap fun god-sim in the not-so-distant future.",

THEY'D RATHER STARVE THAN GET FOOD TO EAT and you cant find an easy way to mass repopulate your island without a week of throwing your computer around your house  did you know that you can use the WASD keys to look around the map  10 / 10 would starve with food to harvest",

I HAVE tried to work every flaw and enjoy the game.. But what game to enjoy thats just as bare as when I last played it last. You can add more content; but it's bare bones if that doesn't draw you like it feels like it's important.. Food.. Yeah hit or miss out the game. Have fun, maybe next year.",
