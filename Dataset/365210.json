This bug has been around since launch (I originally got it on another platform), and I'm surprised it hasn't been fixed yet.",

I know text-based games aren't for everyone but if you like great stories in text-based games, you will love this. Being interested in filmmaking (Not to sound like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥) also makes me love this game too. Overall, I strongly suggest it. It's brilliantly written and has a very high replay value. Also the Steam Achievements are great, as they make you play over and over, doing scenarios differently to obtain certain achievements. Some of the choices are actually pretty hard to decide, to the point where I kinda get worried if I made the wrong decision... But I digress. It's awesome!!!!",
