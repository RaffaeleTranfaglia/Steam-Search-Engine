            "review_text": "This is what you get out of mixing a board game (CLUE) with scoody doo!  The retro style is perfect for this kind of game. This game is about the gameplay and fun and not about the graphics. Due to this fact, it is possible to play it even with an older machine.  There are a lot of characters to choose from. Sadly they are only something visual and do not serve any other purpose. In the future I would love to see that maybe each character has a special ability. The hidden doors, pathways, shortcuts, places to hide and traps are a lot of fun. However once everybody get to know the map and also all the clues you get for the scavenger hunt (they repeat themselves) it kind of gets boring. Maybe a map generator that will place the current rooms different would be awesome! Another suggestion would be to change the speed and power of the DEVIL because currently it is OP. There is almost no way to escape the devil if you are by yourself! Capturing the devil is currently also a pain in the ♥♥♥ because you have to bash space bar! Maybe it would be more fun to use “a” and “d” alternating. A “Tutorial” button in the main menu wouldn’t hurt anybody because the instructions you get in the loading screen disappear to fast and new players are lost in the first game! Another big thing is that the microphone is constantly turned on. I know that the developers had a plan but some players on the one hand do not like it the fact that everybody can hear them, because maybe they are on teamspeak with friends, at all and on the other hand some microphones are making noises that I never knew they do exist and that is more than just annoying.   Summary: This game has just been released! I have played it since DAY ONE (Kickstarter) and a lot has changed! So I am looking forward that things will change! Even with the current - let’s call them “bugs” - it is a lot of fun!",

            "review_text": "Okay. So first things first, I absolutely love this game.   There are several different ways to play the game, which are all fun. If you're the devil, you can try and be sneaky, killing them off one by one, or you can be really gung ho about. Both have their advantages, both have their disadvatages.   As the survivors you also have different play styles which revolve around the other players in the game. You can try and work together, you know safety in numbers, which is an extremely valid point which I will explain in a minute, or you can go solo. Because most of the time when you encounter other players, everything devolves into a giant slap fight.  Now as I said there is safety in numbers, because it's near impossible to capture the devil solo. Let me explain. The system by which you capture the devil (and also revive others) is button mashing. You have to mash the hell out of your space bar. It seems very contoller-y, so hopefully the game will eventually get full controller support. Because as it is now, I sometimes experience issues where the button mashing doesn't work with controllers.  Something else, this game really gets to you. The first couple times you play the game you'll be a bit confused. But once you've gotten the hang of it, you could end up being the last person alive besides the devil, with four more items to collect, feeling the tension build further with every item collect, and every time you walk through a door wondering 'Is this it? Is this the one where the devil's waiting on the other side?'.  Some things that I wouldn't really call cons, but I think could use some adjusting:  The Sprinting System - Basically your character can sprint for a couple seconds, and if you step on a puddle or walk over a rock you fall over. That's pretty cool. What isn't cool is that when your character runs out of sprint, rather than just slow down to walk they trip. This is something that is gauranteed to happen. Your character will trip when you run out of sprint, which brings up a problem. The devil can sprint forever, and will only trip due to obstacles, he/she also runs ever so slightly faster than you. So if you get chased by the devil, you have to hope you can escape through some scene transition or you're dead. Because nothing stops the devil from camping by your body once you've fallen over.  The Button Mashing - If this game ever got full controller support, this would be okay, but even then not everyone has a controller. So I think this whole concept needs to be reimagined somehow, because I could totally see this feature being the death of my keyboard.   The Slapping Feature - You can slap any character and they get slapped aside, and have a period where they have to stand back up and where they are invulnerable. The problem is, slapping itself has no cool down. I've very commonly seen when multiple people are in an area just slapping one another nonstop, not allowing either of them to get their items. I believe that the slap itself should have a cooldown, then people would be less inclined to slap every single person they pass in the halls. After all, wasting that slap on a person only to turn the corner and face the devil would be very bad. That slap could literally be the difference between life and death for them if it had a cooldown. As it is now, when you encounter someone in the hallway, even if neither of you ever stop moving, there is a 90% chance they will slap you.   Now is this game worth ten dollars when it's on sale?  Definetly.  Is this game worth fifteen dollars? Yes.  I would rate this game as a 7/10  And I would recommend it.",

            "review_text": "Fantastic unique little game, where the devil is out to get you, you &amp; your partner must search and capture this devil. Simple enough right? The way voice communication is implemented into the game is refreshing, as you don't need to work just together but avoid eavesdroppers who can hide in passages, listening to your every word. The sounds in this game can tell you a lot, and are very well done. The art-style is fun and quirky, and the mansion is large enough to get pleasantly lost in. Overall a great take on the murder mystery multiplayer genre.  You do need a mic to experience the game to its fullest, and the game is surprisingly quiet, empty almost at times. But at the weekend/evenings, when there are a few full-ish matches to join, the fun really ensues, and it does leave me wondering why the game is so very quiet.",

            "review_text": "Beginning Comments: I don't have a whole lot of hours in it yet due to the lack of playerbase (Not the game's fault, I think it just swooped in under the radar), but this game has an awesome concept. The devs gave everyone who played the beta a free key, and they delivered, so I promised I would still buy a copy (for a friend) if they stayed true to their word, so I did as well. No regrets.  About the Game: Hide and Seek. Scavenger Hunt. Clue. A dash of Murder? Who can you trust? Your teammate? The other 10 players? Yourself? No one. You must not trust anyone with your life as it will be short-lived if you do so. You're spawned in a mansion with your teammate and 10 other players, one secretly being the Devil, and you must complete the ultimate scavenger hunt to free yourself from this haunting chase.  My personal Suggestion(s): 1. Open mic is a great idea on paper, but the only downside aside from the obvious mic spam from some users is the lack of ability to communicate with others you're already in a group chat with. Perhaps the ability to mute yourself in the game? I know that degrades the experience in a way, but I'd hate to be chatting normally to friends, but be techincally spamming in others ears within proximity.  2. I know this is trivial, but maybe a lobby idea where we can see other player's names? I figure that'd be useful if you have friends joining off of you.  3. If more maps are planned for the future, I'm psyched for that. Nothing wrong with the current mansion map of course, but it'll get stale after an extended period of time.  My Rating (So far): 8/10. The concept is original and creative, the pre-release setup the developers had gave me faith in the game's future. Kudos to the devs for being involved from the get-go!   Final Comments: This game has great potential within it, and has some dedicated, friendly developers behind it that made me think to myself: 'I wanna buy this game.' I already had the idea of buying it in my head before I even did any real research on the game; the concept looked that good. I hope all goes well as the devs continue to work on this game, and I hope more people find out about it as the current playerbase needs a slight boost.",

            "review_text": "I've played nearly 8 hours of this game. The concept is great, but the gameplay doesn't actually match what the trailer or description convey. If you're looking for a deception game like Town of Salem, Werewolf, or BSG where you want to find the secret traitor, you will be disappointed. If you're looking for a scavenger hunt racing game where sometimes you stray and try to tackle someone instead, you will enjoy this.  It is not an 11v1 game: it is a 2v2v2v2v2v2 game where one of the teams is lucky enough to have a faster character that can kill you. The devil is not the '1,' because he can still win with his partner. Also, the trailer says things like 'betray' and 'deceive,' but the current win condition encourages the devil to cooperate with his team member. There is no incentive to betray at all. And no, I don't mean 'there is an incentive to betray but it's more strategic to cooperate'; I mean there is literally 0 incentive to betray. Because of this, it's not really part of the gameplay.   It's still fun, but the gameplay experience is very different than what the trailer and concept description would have you believe. It's not like Werewolf or Mafia or any deception game, really. I'd liken it more to The Ship (which is cheaper, has a larger player base, and bots to play against even if you can't find a lobby).  I do think it's worth the $5 I paid for it, but it's not worth $15, especially if you can't play during the scheduled times in the discussion or if you don't have enough friends to guarantee a game. Also, there were so many bugs found within the first month of release that it really felt like I was paying to be a part of a beta instead of paying for a full game. A lot of them have been fixed now, but it's still disappointing that there hasn't been a dev update since December of last year.",

The Devil can kill a player in 3 hits from full to zero and the only time I've seen a Devil die is when they took 75% of the damage walking into traps.  - Slapping and Capturing a Devil do nothing presently.  It's not 11v1 its 2v2v2v2v1+1, The entire verbage of the game is misleading.  The intentions are good but the design is poor and was not well thought out.
