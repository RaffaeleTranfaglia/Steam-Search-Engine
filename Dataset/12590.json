I don't understand why this is the case and would hope it can be fixed soon please. But I still enjoy the game overall.",

I did have the boxed version of this years ago and, at the time, it worked with a joystick controller but nothing has been done it seems to get it working right before they put it on Steam. It's old and used to be fun but considering the many other racing games (old and new) that work fine with Win 7 without problems, this is not worth the time or money. I bought, tried to get it to work with no luck whatsoever so I got a refund.",
