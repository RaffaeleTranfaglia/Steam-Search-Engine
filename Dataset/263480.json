It definitely has some potential. Albeit playing this on a potato it runs decently enough to play the first waves. Review gets updated after I play it some more.  NEEDS MASTER RACE ROBOT QUEEN. CAUSE KF had PATRIARCH!!!1111eleven  And don't read the sh!tpostings about similarities to other wave based defence/survival shooters. Nobody gives a fk about those comparisons. It is not those games. I played a lot of those shooters (mostly the cheap ones (Orion: Dino horde or whatever its called now)) Added PvP a while back and workshop support. This game could have all of that too. SUPPORT IT!",

            "review_text": "Final Rush is a Sci-Fi Multiplayer Co-op FPS, in which you fend off waves of robotic enemies. After each wave you are able to upgrade/buy new weapons, skills or customise your armor. Sounds pretty neat, right?  Well, to be honest, the game is quite fun for a while. The thing is, a multiplayer game like this simply needs a lot more to keep being fun and interesting.   The main problem of Final Rush, is the lack of players/servers. At the time of writing, there was no active server and for that, no active players. I did set up my server but during that time no other player joined me. You are able to fight the robots by yourself but that surely is not an easy task.  The gameplay felt a bit off to me. Destroying robots does not feel satisfying, gun control is a bit weird, even walking doesn't feel right. I did not get far enough into the game to know if the robots act differently after a few waves but the first waves of robots just come walking towards you and start beating you, so the A.I. is pretty much non-existent.   Since the game uses the UT3 engine the graphics are OK. The maps are nicely done but might bore quickly.   Overall, Final Rush is not a bad game and you could have some fun if you buy the game together with some friends. The game is quite steep and there are better games that offer the same kind of gameplay. One game that comes to mind is 'Interstellar Marines', which also has a mode in which you destroy robots, just not in waves.    ",

            "review_text": "As of right now, no, I cannot recommend this. The graphics look great, but as someone who started out playing shooters on the PC, I am dissapointed in the lack of proper movement. There are far too many things in the enviornment to get caught on and the players movement is slow and restricted. Even on normal difficulty, I kept getting caught in corners and assualted by waves of robots, which I cannot seem to kill without extreme difficulty.  Edit: Alright, so I decided to rewrite my review upon request from Strike Games. This game is not my cup of tea, but that may be because I was raised on fast-paced shooters like Unreal Tornament. This game feels a bit too campy for me, and the fact that you are using bullets against robot seems ineffective. I feel that, in the future, we would have better weapons for dealing with such things, like plasma guns. The lack of pickups and instead having to pay for ammo and health is just not a mecanic I am fond of. I feel the game takes too long to pick up and by the time I have even a chance at getting a decent gun, I am being overrun.  I also feel that this game could benefit from having some sort of campain mode. It is cool that they included the story for the player to read, but playing though it would be much cooler. Maybe add missions and/or a tutorial so it is not just you getting thrown in. It is a bit confusing to get the hang of, honestly.",
