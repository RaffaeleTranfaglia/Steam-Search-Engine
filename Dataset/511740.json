I'm kidding of course  unless you live in a police state  . But check out this equally intimidating question: How do you make a school shooter game without freaking out the general public?  'Easy!' Gal*Gun: Double Peace says, 'Have japan make it and have it be pervy instead of violent!' I can confidently say that Gal Gun is the best school shooter game I've ever played. It also ranks very high in my list of pervy anime games. The core gameply loop is solid and enjoyable (Rail shooters are still fun in 2016!). No part of the game made me feel like I was grinding although that might change if you care about getting all the achievements. Replayability is also very high which makes sense considering the game is designed for you to replay it a few times.   I think the highest praise I can give this game is if the perviness and tropey anime jokes were removed, I would keep playing Gal*Gun. That's more than I can say for any of the Neptunia or Senran Kagura games until IF figures out how to make a Neptunia kart racer.",

If you can get past that though this is a surprisingly fun shooter that's different from what you'd normally expect from the genre.  If youlike AkibaStrip then you'll definitely like this.",

I get sad and go get some icecream but I can't even do that right because I get shot by a pair of duel m1911's and wake up and see that every girl wants to give me pity sex! a angel comes down and says that I was such a scrub that I got 360 no-scoped by her so hard every girl I meet will wanna give me pity sex! I'm still stuck as to how that's a bad thing but she says she'll lose her job or some ♥♥♥♥ if I don't go confess to my 'true love' yeah well my left hand fell asleep while I was playing with my joystick to her mounds of hopes and dreams, Then I have to combat the girls I once called friends and find my true love. All and all I'm never going back to that Dairy Queen it ripped me off, a angel shot my leg (fockin noob) and I got the weirdest erection I think I will ever have. I would marry my entire school again and I give this a drunk angel out of college out of your sister.",

            "review_text": "Despite the obvious pervyness in this game, this is actually a really good rail-shooter similar to games like House of the Dead or Time Crisis where you have to take down various enemies with different difficulties and bosses that are also challenging and fun.  I quite love the stories for the different romance options in the game, including the possible sister route which is a lot of fun as is Aoi's true ending where she attains her dream that you helped her reach!  I would recommend this more on a discount for those interested and it's a lot of fun for multiple playthroughs.  The only downside is, as of writing this review there has been a bug where it sometimes crashes (usually when in big picture) and it has yet to fixed in this regard.",

        {
            "review_text": " SCORE ZEROED:  There was a patch for this game that has completely broken it for almost everyone who owns it. A month has passed, and still no fix. Until the developer decides to actually fix their ♥♥♥♥, DO NOT BUY. Below is the original review:  A pretty decent game that's pretty badly overpriced.  I like GGDP, It's a good game in my opinion, partially because I'm a disgusting degenerate who likes fanservicey moe ♥♥♥♥, but the gameplay and story aren't what I'd call 'lacking'.  GAMEPLAY: 9/10 This is a rail shooter, and while I have virtually no experience with rail shooters outside of 90s arcade cabinets like Area 51, it seems kind of innovative. You have to shoot at girls to make them... ♥♥♥♥♥♥? that's definitely ♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Anyway, once they ♥♥♥♥♥♥ their life force is drained and they crumble into dust. Each girl has a weak point, meaning it's not the most feasible route to just shoot at the same spot every time. There are also secrets everywhere, most of which are for little sidequests that give you more money for the ingame store, though there are also student books which give you little bios on characters and hidden costumes for the dressing room customization feature. The boss fights aren't too complicated, but they do break up the monotony somewhat.  GRAPHICS/SOUND/PRESENTATION: 8/10 It's an anime game in UE3. It pulls off the look relatively well, but the shading is a little off when you compare it to games that better bridge the gap between 2D anime style and 3D graphics like the new neptunia games or Senran Kagura. It's not 'anime playermodel for UT2004' bad, not by a long shot, but it is just a tad off. Apart from that, no real complaints. If you're picky as ♥♥♥♥ about texture resolutions you'll probably get triggered by this game, but apart from that I have seen much worse in 2015-2016 alone.  STORY: 8/10 Story-wise, this game is alright. It kind of unfolds like a romantic VN. Think Akiba's Trip, both for degree of fanservice and how the story and multiple routes tie into the game. It made me feel feelings, which is pretty damn easy, so maybe I'm not the best person to ask about this. My only gripe is that getting the 'true' endings can be an unforgiving grind fest where you will have to backtrack and replay the entire level just because you picked the wrong dialog choice. Any 'good' endings are not happy endings at all, so it's true ending or bust, which means getting every event and dialog choice perfect. Half the true endings, even, are pretty damn unrewarding.   Ekoro friendzones you, and Kurona only gives a slight tease at the potential for a relationship at the end.    LOCALIZATION: 4/10 First thing's first, this is an uncensored localization, so major props to PQUBE for that, especially nowadays where censorship in localization is absolutely rampant. The translation is alright, it gets a little memey, but it's definitely not Doerr-tier and I find it to be acceptable. By far the worst part though, and THE reason why this section has a 4/10 when it otherwise would say ~9/10, is the cardinal sin of NOT HAVING A COMPLETE TRANSLATION. The UI is translated and cutscenes are translated, that's it. No gameplay segments are translated, none of the special events have english subtitles, subtitles are nowhere to be seen anywhere. I understand the reason for this probably boils down to 'subtitles weren't coded into the original release and we couldn't be bothered to do it on our end', but that's no excuse. I really hope they fix this considering it's the most requested fix, though I kind of doubt they will.  TECHNICAL: 6/10 As far as the port itself? It's pretty solid, though generally my only requirements for a port involve how playable it is. To this game's credit, I never had a framerate snag, crash, or freeze for the 8 hours so far I've put into this port. My only complaint is that all my control prompts were in XBOX 360 controller format, when I didn't even have mine plugged in. I was unable to find an option to change this. The biggest problem with the port, though, is that it's  too easy . Even on the harder mode this is one of the easiest games I've ever played, which seems to be the result of porting a game where aim is key from a platform where aiming is a pain in the ♥♥♥ thanks to thumbsticks to a platform where it's much, much easier thanks to the mouse, without considering the massive impact that change in control schemes has on gameplay.  PROS/CONS  AKA the TL;DR section of the review. # of +s/-s indicate how good/bad a point is. + + + indicating an absolutely fantastic feature/consideration or innovation, ± indicating a neutral but noteworthy point, - being a nitpick, - - - indicating a likely deal breaking flaw, etc.   + + No censorship + + Cute waifus + + Decent variety in rail shooter mechanics + Engaging (enough) story + Decent graphical quality + Stable  ± Odd(ish) looking shading  - - Partial Translation; lacks subtitles for in-game sequences. - Unforgiving story endings and conditions - And a spite point for those conditions involving grinding the same levels over and over - Incredibly easy when played with mouse.  Overall how much do I recommend this?  eeeeeehhhhhhh...  Even as someone who likes his ecchi games, I still have to say there's probably better ways to spend $40. I'd highly suggest waiting until a sale drops it to $20, because there's just not near enough here to justify that price tag unless you are absolutely crazy about your ecchi games.",

If you never got a girlfriend go get this game you will get happy! ;D Its a railshooter with a short but funny story and it also contains lots of anime and videogame referenzes. You can play with your mouse and keyboard but i recommend playing with a controller because the controlls arent working that well with keyboard and mouse. This game contains ecchi only that means NO hentai. It contains a story mode,score mode, collection mode and a dressing mode. In story mode you play the story of the game with shooting levels, boss battles, visual novel content with dialog choices which are important to get the hearth of your favorite girl and you can collect in every level backstorys of the girls and new outfits. In score mode you can play every level (if you already discovered it), boss battle and events where you can get an highscore. In gallery mode you can look at all girls and read their backstorys. And dressing mode is a dressing room where you can decide the outfits of the girls and items. The only bad point of the game is that there are some item issues with the dlcs ( you get the wrong items). I really recommend this game and can say its worth the price ^^ It should win because it gives me a nice school flair like in my schooltime and in no other game are you loved soo much by many cute girls ^-^",

            "review_text": "To be honest I expected this to be funnier. Maybe I'm getting too old for this.  I found this game to be more entertaining than Senran Kagura, and less entertaining than Akiba's Trip.  The premise sounds much more hilarious when you read it than it is during the gameplay. However, the game has surprising amount of depth in it, in the sense that there are a LOT of small things you could unlock, fill, 'collect', etc. You could probably kill at least a month if not more hunting them all.  Every single girl (I think there's roughly 100 characters in the game) in the game has unique character, short biography, may or may not occasionally give out an optional 'quest' (those show up in cellphone between levels), you can get an ending with any of them, and they are all voiced. Of course, only main heroines get proper full ending with unique song/artwork, but every char has few voiced lines to say in ending squence. So, ridiculous amount of work went into making the characters. You can also spent large amount of time going hunting for every hidden item and secret in the game.  However, the difficulty is quite low (with mouse you probably won't have any trouble beating the game on maximum difficulty), locations are occasionally reused - meaning you have same background level, but you go through it in different way, hidden items are in different locations, and different characters attack you.  The game also has strange DLC policy, which may or may not be an expression of japanese humor. I think the day where a japanese game is released with clothing editor (and not with thousand costume dlcs), the hell will freeze over.  I've also experienced occasional crashes. Pausing the game and alt-tabbing it crashes it fairly reliably, those crashes happened two or three times between levels. Thankfully, levels are short.  Another thing that is worth keeping in mind, that there are a lot of voice lines without subtitles. Girls say interesting thing, but unless you have at least very basic understanding of japanese (meaning you can roughly understand 20..50% by ear), you'll miss them out. There's nothing critical, and and 'VN-style' dialogue is fully translated (meaning you have text you can read), but in few situations in minigames characters give you hints with voice about what you need to do next, and those voice lines have no subtitles.  Bottom line: Quite a bit of depth in it, not very difficult, worth checking out, but if you want something hilarious, Akiba's trip might be a better choice.",
