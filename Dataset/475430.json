It felt like I was actually in North Korea, the developers put in a lot of work in the stealth mechanics of this game. The animations are excellent as well, it amazes me that they didn't ask for 60 dollars for such a high quality game. The multiplayer is amazing too, it will truly be the CoD killer.  9/11       Jesus made me write a good review.",

            "review_text": "This game is a mess, it doesn't feel finished in the slightest. The gameplay isn't fun at all, which is the main fps gameplay, and then the incredibly poor attempt at platforming. I thought I would get at least a little bit of entertainment from the live-action cutscenes, but those fell flat as well. The acting is very weak (I guess it doesn't matter because memes). i never found anything funny or compelling. I was about to quit the game out of boredom, but it ended before i got a chance to quit out. They try to make up for the short length by shoving in equally bad bonus games. The graphics don't help this game either. Textures look terrible and models even worse. Overall this game isn't worth the money or time, you're better of doing really anything else.",

To be fair, I wasn't able to make a game in their age, soooo...maybe, if they stick to it, we'll see something decent in the next 10 years.  But for this game...1,99â‚¬...that's kinda harsh. Back in the day, we would have passed this to our buddies on networking parties.  Good thing, it was a present of a friend on Steam.",
