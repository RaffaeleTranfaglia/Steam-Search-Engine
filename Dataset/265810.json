            "review_text": "I have no idea why so many people are upset with this game.  Some say it doesn't work, some say it's laggy, some say it's just a port directly from mobile.  Well sure if your computer can't handle NES graphics and its processor is a toaster then you probably can't play it, and yeah it's a port from mobile, except in create mode you get a lot more room, there's no buyable products (unlike mobile) you get everything for free once you buy the game.  The Sandbox gives you everything you love about other sandbox games and smashes them all together, you are a god, literally.  I suggest this game to my fellow Tomogachi users from way back when, because you can do the exact same thing in this game with humans, but on a much larger scale!  Want to nuke it all start over? Why use the 'New' button, just use a nuke!  Want to simulate a meteor crashing into earth? Go for it, there's meteors.  Do you like having control over everything single thing right down to the atom? Well of course you do, you're human.  Get this game, JUST DO IT!",

It gave me a underwhelming game with not even half of the stuff that I have seen to be possible in the video. Dont buy it. It is getting boring fairly quickly.",

I do not recommend this game for PC.",
