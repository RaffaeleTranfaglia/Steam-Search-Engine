            "review_text": "Just want to give my early impressions. Not a full, formal review.  The Banner Saga is a Kickstarter game and it's exactly what Kickstarter should be about: visionaries with bold ideas that probably wouldn't get funded through traditional means. And that's exactly how TBS feels; it's a game designed by visionaries who love every bit of their craft but that leads to some issues of its own I'll address later.  First off, this is a gorgeous game. The art style combines the clear-line character art of Ivan Bilibin with the iconic backdrops of Eyvind Earle. Every piece of art from the intricately detailed world map to the rotoscoped animations is beautifully rendered. The world of TBS draws heavy inspiration from Norse mythology but there's quite a bit of detail and world building when I was expecting it to be very straightforward. While it is still a strategy game through and through, fans of RPGs will find plenty to like with the well defined characters and detailed world.  Being a strategy game, combat is at the forefront but has some niggling issues. It's a very clean move-action system where character order is more important than arbitrary stats like speed. Being wholly turn based, action economy is the name of the game as you're forced to dominate the battlefield through superior placement of your units. Combat could be a bit more robust but normal difficulty is a decent challenge so far and there's 'hard' for people wanting more of a challenge. Thankfully, battles are evenly spaced between story scenes so every individual battle feels special.  Unfortunately, my biggest complaint of an otherwise fine system is the speed. Combat moves at a lethargic pace. There's no option to skip animations or speed combat and in a game where battles with as few as 4 enemies can take 10-15 minutes average, having a speed-up option is sorely missed.   TBS is immensely pleasurable so far and I can only hope it remains consistent to the end. I'll update my thoughts as I go along.",

            "review_text": "Most games these days are designed to be won; The Banner Saga is meant to be survived. Anything more would be a mockery of the Viking apocalypse suffered by its characters. The atmosphere of Stoic Studios' first title is so evocative of desolation and despair that succeeding too grandly feels like a betrayal of the twilight sagas. With the gods dead and the sun stalled in the sky, humans and giants work together to eke out a shattered existence. The arrival of an ancient enemy throws the tenuous balance into question and sends desperate warrior caravans across the hostile landscape. The displaced and hopeful follow in their wake, scraping together what lives they can. The leaders of these caravans are forced to make difficult decisions, by which their followers live and die.  The point of view shifts several times throughout The Banner Saga, demonstrating the dire straits in which both humans and giants find themselves. However, in spite of the multiple views, so much about what's really happening remains unknown. Each caravan meets many people, most of whom have an angle for survival. Figuring out who can be trusted is one of the great challenges of the game, and also one of its greatest pleasures. It's easy to be trustworthy when supplies are high and no one's laid low by crippling wounds. Righteousness is more difficult to come by when the gods are dead, the horizon is alight with burning villages, and taking on new allies means condemning others to slow starvation.  Despite the pervasive apocalypse, not all is lost. Stoic has done admirably at focusing on the personal stories at the epic's core. The key characters' motivations are well-explained, and their mysteries reveal themselves at an appropriate pace. Even when all seems lost, moments of heroism, compassion, and courage keep the narrative of doom from becoming crushing. The ending, such that it is, is powerful. Unfortunately, it is abrupt. Future chapters of the saga have already burdened themselves with the hype from the first installment's unanswered questions.   Everything looks and sounds amazing. Character designs are rich and colorful, and their animation is like something from out of a lost 80s classic. The visuals scale impressively, handling great crumbling monuments and fierce monsters as well as delicate human gestures. The deliberate staging extends to travel scenes where no actions are allowed. Watching the caravan struggle through the landscape to deep chants and mournful horn movements offers counterpoint to moments of blood and steel. These contrasts demonstrate relatable smallness against the enormity of the end. Occasionally animations look uncanny against their backgrounds, but the characters are nuanced enough that the strangeness almost feels like a stylistic choice. The music is professionally orchestrated, and would stand out as a compliment to the mood no matter what medium it accompanied.   Whereas The Banner Saga's story and sensory appeals are difficult to critique without gushing, its mechanics are more controversial. Combat has many quirks that may seem counter-intuitive to SRPG players. However, learning the ins and outs of the system can be an enjoyable puzzle. Battle takes place on a flat grid. Up to six plot-relevant allies, drawn from a frequently shifting pool, face off against a potentially frightening number of enemies. Battle proceeds in alternative rounds, with one member of the enemy force getting a turn for every allied turn. As a result, keeping weakened enemies alive is often an effective tactic. Hit points double as a character's damage capacity, so getting the enemy to waste a turn commanding a shattered unit can delay a stronger unit's attack.   Managing each character's reserve of willpower and exertion - the amount of willpower that can be spent in a turn - draws the resource conservation elements from the rest of the game into battle. Every enemy killed provides bonus willpower that can be distributed to any character, allowing momentum to build from a victorious thrust. Racking up death willpower isn't always a strong enough incentive to overcome the strangeness of alternating combat rounds, but it helps. If the battle quirks get too unmanageable, it's possible to dial the difficulty down from hard or normal to easy.  Despite its enjoyable features, not every desperately calculated moment of battle is joyous. Many battles begin with a large-scale conflict, which pits the caravan's rank-and-file soldiers against enemy hordes. The formation options in this system don't feel as strongly tied as they could be to the skirmishes that follow. Most battlefields are devoid of terrain, and facing doesn't matter. As a result, character placement, willpower expenditure, and party composition become the major tactical elements.   The sole currency for preparing for battle is renown. When all is lost, only a man's observed actions are important. Renown is used on stat-boosting treasure, character advancement, and purchasing supplies for the caravan. Focusing on any of these areas limits growth in the others, and doing everything is impossible. Keeping a trailing column of peasants fed is an admirable goal, but it becomes difficult to justify when contrasted with clicking the button that increases an ally's armor break ability. The choice is further complicated by the knowledge many more could die if the warriors aren't kept strong.  Playing The Banner Saga as a standard game of optimization and the greatest possible success may lead to disappointment. Trusting the crazy - eyed wanderer who smells of stale mead could be the best decision you make all week, or it could lead to a knife in your back. Rolling with the punches and accepting the permanent death of a favored all adds texture to the banner of a doomed people. Some choices are mechanically better than others, causing the more damaging answers to become less interesting during multiple replays. Certain tricks will only be novel the first time around, while others allow more strategic calculation.  All saves are autosaves, and are made at predetermined checkpoints. There's no indication when these saves occur, except manually checking the Load menu. Attempting the old Choose Your Own Adventure trick of sticking a bookmark in at a difficult decision point isn't so easy here. Loading a save to choose a new answer may require fighting several battles again. On the plus side, the game is short enough to invite multiple replays. Although the central narrative is the same every time, choices made along the way lead to different side paths and party composition. Simple, split-second decisions can lead to significant consequences.  Stoic Studios have set themselves up with a difficult act to follow. The Banner Saga is a rare game that forces its player to think and feel, often in delightful opposition. Its subsystems combine to support the narrative of desperate heroism, hard choices, and survival. Like the doomed giants who fight its battles, The Banner Saga is powerful, thoughtful, and worthwhile. Recapturing this winning combination is going to be risky. When a game is so precariously excellent, a wiggle either way in the sequel could spoil the formula that made the first so magical. Regardless of whether future installments stand or fall, The Banner Saga has done its duty. It may not always give gamers what they want, but it gives them what they need: challenging questions, tactical gameplay, and a strong, fully realized atmosphere.",

            "review_text": "Beautiful but Flawed.  Greatness lurks beneath the skin of The Banner Saga. It is a beautiful, emotionally involving and utterly unique experience, but sadly I found this first installment to be marred by a host of frustrating design problems.   The artistic vision of The Banner Saga is without peer. Its world, characters and story are depicted with rare clarity and conviction, without compromise. The visual style is bleak yet gorgeous and can be mistaken for no other game. The music (by the talented Austin Wintory of 'Journey' fame) powerfully evokes a forlorn, dying world. The writing too is excellent throughout, defining tragic characters with sombre nuance.  The combat in the game is also novel and interesting, with great tactical depth. Battles are tense and strategic, and the developers succeeded admirably at weaving it into the storyline - battles affect choices and choices affect battles, each adding meaning to the other. That a turn-based combat game kept me so enthralled with its story (an unremittingly bleak one, at that) is a testament to the talent and passion of the studio.   That said, at the same time everything feels somehow underproduced; voice acting and animation are conspicuously absent in all but a few scattered scenes, and each character has one fixed expression - which can sometimes be incredibly inappropriate to the dialogue. While it is true that the art design of the game is deliberately spare, my impression was that some things had been over-simplified, as if the game had been rushed to completion.  Minor cosmetic issues aside, the game felt unfinished in other more problematic ways. It crashed several times for me, and on each occasion I suffered from poorly placed autosaves. The combat interface also frequently proved vague or incomplete, in many cases failing to explain critical rules. One consistent frustration was the inability to undo or preview character movement, in cases where the (often severe) consequences of a particular move could not be determined beforehand - this did not seem like a deliberate choice, but as with the incomplete UI more likely due to a lack of playtesting.   The most frustrating aspect of the game, for me, was the handling of player narrative choices. This story is one of loss and hopelessness, so as such I accept that there are no happy endings to be found, but rather a series of tragedies to be survived. And as in combat, the player is asked to make difficult decisions, with no clear right answer - but unlike in combat, the consequences are utterly random. In combat, the player is asked to make careful choices and is rewarded with various bonuses on success. These bonuses usually relate to specific characters, as do the combat choices, so this feedback cycle works well, strengthening engagement with the characters and story in a satisfyingly consistent way.  Narrative choices on the other hand, often reward the player with an unforeseeable slap in the face, throwing away much of their prior hard work - for example by stealing away a character in whom the player had already invested a lot of time and emotional energy. I question why player choice is involved at all, if it does not involve skill. If the intended purpose was to make the player identify with the hopelessness of the characters' situation, then this would have worked better if the choices embodied clear tradeoffs: in a bad situation, allow the player to pick which sacrifice to make, based on what is more important to them or to the character. But by consistently leaving me feeling cheated and powerless, by the end of the game it merely served to reduce my engagement with the characters and plot.   Years from now I feel sure that I will remember The Banner Saga more for its strengths than for its weaknesses. The beauty of the experience implies a great deal of talent, and the various flaws are all fixable - as such I still highly recommend the game, and have high hopes for its sequels!",

            "review_text": " The Banner Saga  caught me by surprise.  I did not hear of its [highly succesful] Kickstarter campaign, and only came to learn of its existence when it showed up on Steam's 'coming soon' section.  Obviously the first thing to draw my attention was the art style. As you can see from screenshots and trailers, it is clearly inspired by Walt Disney's works, and indeed it's absolutely gorgeous. Animation quality is great, too.  The gameplay is really enjoyable. I'm not the biggest fan of turn-based combat, but  The Banner Saga  presents some interesting mechanics that make encounters with enemies feel like more complex chess matches.  Where the game really shines, though, is in the 'caravan-management' sections. You lead families and warriors for leagues across a beautiful land torn by war, making sure mouths are fed and morale stays high, facing dilemmas almost every step of the way. Every decision you make feels meaningful and impacts the world and characters around you.  As the story approaches its climax, the atmosphere grows dire. At one point, I genuinely felt like I had painted myself into a corner, bad call after bad call. I despaired. That's a feeling few games can boast about being able to provoke.  But for all its ruthlessness,  The Banner Saga  is not unfair. I persevered, and managed to complete the campaign. Finishing the game really felt like an accomplishment.  And an accomplishment is what this first chapter of  The Banner Saga  is. A work of art. A masterpiece of our time.  I stand in awe.",

            "review_text": "I bought the Deluxe pack and I muıst say, that this game is lesser than I've expected. Don't get me wrong, It's good stuff you will play. Yet, there are some issues I need to tell.  1. The game is largely story driven: The wonderful game map may give you a misconception, that you can travel to any area. Sadly, your route is predefined.  2. Most of the character abilities are useless and some items are over powered: For instance, give Alette the +3 Armor breaking item and you will see it's much better than her special ability. Somewhat broken if you ask me. The spearmaster's impale ability is mostly useless except of the projectile enemies that flee after each damage they take. Another item gives you a knockback ability with 4+ strength damage. LIKE A BOSS!!!  3. This game has a main character: The way that the game was presented, you may assume that Rook is just a kindle of the events and you will be very flexible on each decision making process or character addition. It gave me an idea that if other people play the same game, we might have entire different outcomes. (Someone, who decides to go on with the lead of Ekkill, Eirik, Hakon etc. find entirely different paths in the story was what I have expected.) Characters like Ubin and Ludin have rarely a weight at the story.  4. Next episode: Within the game, you see a lot of additional material that reveals a centaur race, and you know that there would be much more to explore. The game just came out as the first episode of what is bound to come afterwards. But, I'm still waiting for sequels, DLC storylines etc... I begin to suspect that this will not happen.

The game plays like you are escorting a caravan with clansmen, fighters and Varl to deal with and feed on the way. The animation and characters look great and awaken a lot of nostalgia (for people having watched things such as Fire and Ice and the LOTR animated film). There are several chapters that see you following different characters to add variety to the story. The combat is quite tactical and is a challenge with some character progression and single items allowed to boost them slightly. Main Criticsm - The voice acting is limited so you end up reading a lot of conversations (although it is worth reading in most cases).",

            "review_text": "Recommend -- barely.   This game is fun, but it in no way lived up to the hype/my expectations, and it is quite pricey for what it is. I've played through twice, in about 15 hours altogether.   Basically, this game is 'Viking Oregon Trail', with level ups. Very narrow level ups (stat selection for pre-made characters).   There's no character creation (though you do have access to several different character's POV during the game -- but you don't have control over switching between those). Events in the game (for example agreeing to let certain characters join or not join your caravan) don't really impact the game other than to provide a bit of flavor to your next play through.   The world is interesting enough, and some of the characters are intriguing, but by and large there's no pay off on that, because it's half a game. The game just stops, at about what I thought was the half way mark. So while there's hints at things that it might be interesting to learn about the characters, that's as far as it gets.   Furthermore, the characterisation is not that sophisticated, despite the praise heaped on the game. It's not terrible, but it's by no means outstanding. The characters are very trope-y: 'Concerned Dad' 'Teen Girl' 'Lady Archer' 'Rude Prince' 'Pyscho Pyro' 'Proud Warrior Race Guy' etc.   A final pet peeve: the dialogue in this game was very iffy in places. It's supposed to be reminiscent of a Viking Saga, but the characters are constantly going around using contemporary slang. I'm not expecting Shakespeare -- but it would be nice if the characters didn't use things like 'ok'. It's just -- not in keeping with the milieu.  So, I've told you my reservations for recommending. If you're reading this and thinking, 'wow that's very picky', then maybe this game is for you! But if you're thinking 'no, that would bother me too', maybe skip it or wait for a good sale.   As I said, I've played through twice. I doubt I will again -- fifteen hours and I feel like I've seen everything the game has to offer. I got the game on sale, which I'm really glad about. I feel like it was expensive at the price I paid. I think I'd be genuinely annoyed if I'd paid more. ",

            "review_text": "When I first got this game, I was reminded of Fire Emblem's combat system crossed with a couple choices I thought had no impact on the game. I was wrong, and I am very happy about that.  First off, the combat is reminiscent of Fire Emblem, but it is actually much deeper with the addition of the willpower mechanic, separate health bars for Strength and Armor, and several abilities. It takes only the tutorial to get used to the combat system, but I find myself 5 hours in and I still discover things I didn't know. There is also a sort of mass combat system, where you issue a command to the troops that follow you and then dive into combat. This mass combat system, however bare bones, feels like it belongs, although it could use some improving, because as far as I can tell there are only four commands.  The story is great, and more then earns it's title as a saga. Despite being a dying world,    as the gods are all dead and the sun has stopped in the center of the sky   , its people are alive and vibrant, struggling to survive on this barren world. It reminds me of the D&amp;D setting Dark Sun, except there is still some hope left in the world, however flimsy. You grow attached to characters, mourning their failures and deaths and cheering when they do something cool. At least twice I have figuratively shot myself in the foot to save a character I cared about.  The art is beautiful, and I'm honestly not sure it would work in any other style. The art is realistic enough to portray the humans as human, but stylized enough to make the varl, who are awesome horned giants, and the enemy Dredge, who appear to be some form of automaton, seem right at home in the world.  And the lore, don't even get me started. I play a lot of Dungeons and Dragons (and other role-playing games), and normally play the role of the GM, which means I do a lot of world building. As such, I apprieciate it when a game puts effort into building an interesting world, and I can often kill hours just reading lore and pouring over in-game maps. Stoic has created an excellent world for this, and I have been specifically avoiding the map in The Banner Saga because I know if I don't, I will read every entry and spend two hours doing nothing important.  However, this game is not without it's faults (although some of these 'faults' may just be personal preference). First off, the game feels hard. It isn't, at least not on the difficulty I'm playing on, but it feels as if I'm doing everything wrong. Second, it is a very dense game. As much as I love it, I can only play for maybe an hour before my head starts to hurt and I have to shut it off. This is only a complaint in that I have to shut off the game, and it's a fantastic game.  In short, if you want a game with a deep story, deep combat, and deeper lore, play the Banner Saga. If you want a game where you make decisions, play the Banner Saga. If you want a game where the entire world is putty in your hands, play something else, because the Banner Saga is harsh and unforgiving.",

Instead of trying to kill your opponents, each battle is a struggle to keep as many enemies alive as possible, but with only 1 - 2 life remaining, so they can't do any damage. If you kill an opponent, then the remaining enemies move up in order (essentially getting more turns), which means if there is a powerful enemy in a battle, then by the end, they go every other turn. Enemies like Bellower that heal on their turn make this mechanic even more ridiculous.  If they make a banner saga 2 or come out with additional content, I hope they consider using a standard turn mechanic, where killing an enemy is actually favorable. Also, the map gives the illusion that the game is an open world with lots of travel options, but you are given very few opportunities to make travel choices; I'd like to see more variety in travel.",

If I were to sum it up quickly, it's like XCOM meets Oregon Trail meets Dragon Age (I mean, this IS being made by three former BioWare guys), except you control a bunch of burly, manly, hairy Vikings. Most of the time.  But let me warn you, if you're expecting some sort of deep and complex strategic gameplay, you might as well just turn around and go back to said XCOM. This game is HEAVILY story driven - there's no guarantee a character X will stay by your side till the very end, whether you want it or not. So please, please, just SHADDAP YO FACES and enjoy the story, granted there'll be more of it. Soon™.",

            "review_text": "An exciting game. Very enjoyable, given that you know what to expect.  Gameplay: First thing to note - this isn't a traditional CRPG at all. No open world, no exploring, no looting random enemies etc. etc. Basically, the game consists of story given in textual form plus tactical battles. Surprisingly enough, this game is actually very much like a Japanese visual novel: making choices in dialogues with some fighting in between. Nothing wrong with that, but I guess there are people who dislike that kind of stuff. Combat system: The game has an original turn-based combat system which can be a bit confusing in the beginning, but is, in fact, very consistent and coherent. Fights are interesting and challenging - this game isn't easy at all at Normal difficulty (though it isn't exactly hard, the balance is just right). So that part of the game is very well-executed. Graphics: The artwork in the game is to die for! For me at least it was love at first sight. I actually find it quite difficult to stop pressing F12 all the time. Every single screenshot is a piece of art! Music: Good, adequate, though I'm not exactly willing to listen to that soundtrack when not in game. Which isn't a bad thing, there aren't that many game soundtracks that can stand on their own. Story: I'm not quite finished with it so it's a bit early to say, but so far - not bad at all. And I would definitely play again to see what different choices can lead to. All is well here. If it wasn't for one thing... which is in fact the only thing I didn't exactly like about the game -&gt; Writing: This is the only thing I find somehow... lacking. Don't get me wrong, I like the plot, I like the characters. I don't like writing itself, because it lacks style, it lacks flavor. It wouldn't be such a big deal if this game wasn't at least 50% textual. I'm not saying that all the characters have to speak like they are in the poetic Edda, but all those 'ok', 'crap', 'yeah' and 'everything was a mess'-sort of descriptions are not to my liking. And there are typos too. As a part of the game, it's not crucial, because there's also artwork and music and other things. But had this been a book... I'd probably deem it a poorly-written one.",

            "review_text": "Haunting, beautiful, breathtaking game - The Banner Saga has more soul than any game in recent memory, *certainly* more heart than any game a major studio has produced in forever. Games like this are the exact reason I support indie developers. If you appreciate an enthralling story, a unique combat system and characters you actually care about, try this.   Gameplay-wise, it's Oregon Trail + Heroes of Might and Magic combat + Darklands village interactions, with a multi-tiered narrative and choices that are incredibly emotional. Banner Saga pulls 0% punches, and you feel the results of your actions HEAVILY. The game is relentless, and if you get into it at all be prepared to be left with a deep sorrow in the pit of your stomach, or to be on the edge of your seat, paranoid about what choice you'll have to make next - if Sophie's Choice had giants, it would be The Banner Saga.   As brutal as the game is, that's what makes it so alluring - your choices change the game entirely and none of the characters seem one-dimensional, so you WANT to play again to see what happens if you make this choice or that choice differently. Even just watching your caravan walk through a gorgeous, hand-drawn landscape with snow falling is a sight to behold, and if you're the kind inclined to do so, may even choke you up a bit. The emotion you feel while playing, bad or good, keeps you invested... and if a game makes you FEEL, it has succeeded entirely. I cannot recommend this game enough.",

The musics are great, often featuring folkloric chants that makes it even more imersive to this nordic fantastic tale.  The battles are challenging then easier once you learn to use the right tactics. Their outcomes will depend of the characters you choose.

            "review_text": "I am going to start off with a (kinda) spoiler and and the real kick in the teeth that comes with it before I lead up to a very positive review.   In my opinion and in the opinions of at least a few hundred others the biggest problem with this game is THE ENDING....I can't decide whether to call it non-existent, unfinished or incredibly poorly executed. This game is 1 out of 3 in a planned trilogy by the way. This is something I was not aware of a when I initially purchased the game. There you are prepared now on the good...  Now please bear in mind I do not think I would be nearly as bitter about the ending if the the rest of the game had not hit on so many levels. Initially I thought the combat in the game was based on too simple of a concept but after an hour of play I realized in execution there is a great deal of depth. The simple concept by the way is that of combining atack power and life into one stat for your characters. It really flips the whole concept behind a tactically rpg on its tail and made me think through every battle (and paiiiinfully so on the Hardest Setting). While the RPG style Character Progression of your characters are an Important aspect of gameplay I was pleased to find that the actually Tactical aspects of the game are firmly in the driver seat. To me this is the highlight and the reason any fan of the genre should take the opportunity to download this game (I admit waiting for a sale myself but I would not have been disappointed if I had paid the $19.99 it's currently listed at either).  The story and experience itself is very dark one. It was clearly intended and I feel like the developers hit the nail on the head when it came to using every method and mechanic availalbe to them to create that atmosphere. Your watching this World Tear itself apart while the characters fight to hold it together. The animations, story, music, the gameplay all are all geared up to make you feel that way and were a resounding success.  The complete butchering of the end of the game really hurt and pulled down the review a notch but overall the hours (and i have far more than 10.2 that steam has me at for some reason) of greatness vastly overshadow the final few moments and bad taste I had after finishing the game for the 1st time. This game is refreshingly different from anything I have played before and would recommend it to just about anyone intersted in this genre.  8/10",

The game promises to be a game where decisions are vital and your choices matter. Some other reviewers think that the game is linear despite its promises. The game delivers in its story so well that it needs to have some form of linearity.   Banner saga is its own story and its your job to see to the end of it. You have to make choices that impact the survival and moral stability of your caravan. Right or wrong choices can be fatal depending on how YOU want the game to be played out. The story was phenominal and the visuals were unlike any game I have ever played and will no doubt leave room for future games to copy this design.   When there was voice acting, it was well delivered and very well spoken. The game we are talking about here was a kickstarter project, and voice acting for every cutscene is just not going to happen. Some companies do not have the funding. Luckily, due to the success of this game, we could hope to see improvements in the next part of this 3 part game series.

            "review_text": "Disclaimer: I played about halfway through, got sidetracked for a while by a bunch of other games, and then started over fresh and beat this game once. That is how familiar I am with this game at the time of this review.  Let me say this first: the game is visually stunning. Every single environment, character, and frame of animation has an astonishing hand-drawn/painted feel to it. It seems as though they used a method of rotoscoping to bring the characters' motions to life, and it looks pretty damn impressive. Also, the score is brilliant. The song 'Onward' is what gave me the final push towards picking up the soundtrack.  Alright, so it looks and sounds nice, but what about the most important aspects: gameplay and story? For the most part, gameplay is top notch. Their unique spin on the turn-based genre is fairly hit or miss; you either love it or hate it. That stems from the fact that your fighters' health also determine their damage output. I personally found it very interesting and that it added an extra layer of strategy to each turn. It's all about calculating risks and how to combine each warrior's playstyle to create one combined force.  My first main issue (of two) is what happens in between combat. The caravan sequences, despite being pretty, are pretty monotonous. They only serve as the 'resource management' portion of the game, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. I loved making decisions along the journey, and this is the first game I've played that actually has logical ways to handle each solution (not just a 'good', a 'bad', and a 'wrong' choice), but some of the consequences that came from those actions were pretty unfair. I think it's fair to have someone's decisions mean life or death for some party members, but it almost seems like the odds are stacked against you in many cases. A second playthrough might remedy this, but I didn't even know you could have certain party members with you all the way to the end; it seemed like there was a point where they  had  to die, but I guess not. Also, using the same resource to buy both supplies and level-ups/equipment for your fighters seems like an interesting idea, but it falls flat. You either starve your caravan or fight battles with weak warriors. The story is both cliché and original. The setting, characters, and ideas make it fresh, but some of the creative decisions made (like referring to something evil as 'the Darkness') make it seem like a slight retread of past ideas. Despite this, the world and its inhabitants are interesting, and that to me is more important. The viking/Scandinavian influences fit very well and gave the game (for me) an aspect of intrigue due to very few other games doing something similar. I seem to like the leader characters/father figures the most when it comes to narratives, so I naturally grew fond of Rook and his daughter Alette. I also enjoyed having Iver, Hakon, and Mogr around, all three of them being varl (giant horned men).  My second main issue comes with the conclusion of the game. The length is decent, but it leaves so many plotlines unresolved that it hurts. I understand that Stoic Studio plans on adding on to this series and making it a trilogy, but some of the immediate questions/conflicts aren't touched on at all. The ending feels like a midseason finale rather than a season finale. I'll be happier once they actually do release the next chapter, but I was slightly disappointed. Even though I'm not into JRPGs, I am familiar with how long they are. I was hoping for something along those lines; a truly epic saga told in one tale. Unfortunately, this game is part of a trilogy and it knows it.   Despite me complaining about it for the past paragraph, I can't wait to see what happens next. If you are a fan of turn-based strategy, Norse mythology (kind of), games with beautiful art styles, or you're just really in the mood for something that allows you to make decisions with real consequences, you really can't pass this one up.  PROS  Gorgeous visuals/music Compelling narrative Engaging strategy gameplay Interesting setting/characters  CONS  Inconclusive ending Slightly tedious caravan/resource management  Overall: 8.5/10",

            "review_text": "I'm not sure I've ever felt as vulnerable in a video game as in The Banner Saga. In most tactical RPGs, the barrier to difficulty can simply be hurdled by a spot of grinding. Here, there's no such opportunity. At every stage of the game you are hounded, chased from one location to another, the weight of the enemy always at your back, with hard decisions (which often only make you weaker) stacking up as you move along. There's no chance to pause and grind the game's singular currency - renown - which leaves it always scarce in quantity. This forces you to choose between purchasing supplies for your caravan, strengthening your warriors, or purchasing a shiny item to give you a small power boost, and it never feels like enough. At no point in my playthrough did I feel overpowered. Even my strongest warriors could be felled in one blow if I made a bad tactical decision. At the start of each encounter, there was always the sense of, 'I don't know how I'll make it through this one,' and following each battle, 'I can't believe I made it out of there alive.' And that's only the combat. The game also constantly forces you to make difficult decisions throughout, which frequently lead to the death of your party members. It's not always obvious, either, and since the game has no manual saves - only a handful of sporadic auto-saves - you can only change your mind so often. Sometimes, a decision you made hours ago will come back to haunt you much later, wreaking havoc on your party. So yes - in this game, there isn't just the illusion that your choices matter - they do, and you're bound to make some bad ones along the way. It's a bleak game, and feels like Game of Thrones meets The Walking Dead in terms of tone, and hope (or lack thereof). Luckily, it's also a gorgeous game, with a hand drawn aesthetic that looks quite unlike anything else out there. The combat system is interesting, but not nearly as varied as Japanese TRPGs like FF: Tactics, or the Disgaea series. By the end of the game, the mechanics do feel like a bit of a slog - but then, it suits the game's mood perfectly. To come out as some super charged badass capable of leveling a whole army isn't the point here, and wouldn't suit the story. Here, the core is survival, and the grim likelihood that at any moment, any one of your party might not make it to see the next day.",

The combat is fun and engaging, although I found myself always wishing it was over so I could further the story. Solid RPG elements, great Oregon Trail management, but last but not least gripping characters and plot. This is the old BioWare we all miss. My biggest complaint was going in I was not aware it was the first of a trilogy, so be ready for it to end with you wanting more character development and plot.",

            "review_text": "The Banner Saga is an excellent turn-based RPG, where decisions you make affect the outcome of the story and changes the lives of the games characters.   The story is engrossing and revolves around a march to save your kinsmen from danger. You lean to care about the people in your caravan, which make some of the decisions you have to make very difficult. Although, this also gives the game a lot of replay value, as you strive to make better decisions, and protect more people in your caravan.  Decisions are more than just choosing when to fight, or dialogue choices; when it comes down to it the entire game is a decision of how best to spend your resources. Do you buy supplies for your caravan to help you get to the next area? OR upgrade your combat team? Or buy items to have your combat team? They each use the same resource, so you have to decide where to put your limited resource. Even choosing how often and when to rest effects gameplay.  The combat is isometric turn-based, and involves a lot of strategy, and can at times, be surprisingly challenging. There are three game modes, to provide more or less challenge to the player. Hard mode being very challenging indeed. Overall an enjoyable experience that will leave you wanting more. As soon as I finished the game, I began researching if there was to be a sequel, and I was pleased to hear the play is for this game to be part of a trilogy.  Definitely worth playing, and highly recommended.",

Every single choice you make changes something, even if little; and there is so much to choose. The battles are hard and some tactics is needed. Enemies are evil ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that will ravage you. And if you lose the battle, the story will go on...unless you want to retry the whole chapter again. Your people will die if you choose to fight an hard battle, and so they'll die if your supplies aren't enough or simply you make bad decisions when out in the wild. They will either respect you if you prove to be a valorous leader, or pity and despise you if you only think about yourself. And this changes everything about how the story goes on.  Harsh environment for a strong story, with quality narration and a mature theme. 7/10 for me, the 8-9 hours lenght really killed it. For such a masterpiece i expected like 20-30 gameplay hours atleast.",

The art deserves an extra mention; I'm inclined to think the old-school 2D animation is able to capture character and spirit in a unique way. Don't forget to entertain yourself with the soundtrack, 'We are all guests upon the land' is my favorite.  Praise aside, the game could have used a hefty chunk more of the talented well-picked voice actors. Some cutscenes loose their edge because of it, but it does little to hinder the overall wonderfully positive experience.",

        {
            "review_text": "Three things make The Banner Saga excellent:  First, the setting is well done. The plot is interesting even if, in a general sense, it is unoriginal. It really shines in the details and nuances (especially how the plot and characters interact) and the feeling of desperation and struggle really comes through as the game progresses. The music is exceptional. It's epic when it needs to be without being over the top and subtle when it needs to be without being unnoticeable. The visuals and sound effects are also solid, and I especially enjoyed the animation style that Stoic used for this game.  Second, the choices. Your choices really drive this game in a way I haven't seen in many others. Sure you have games where you're faced with a choice that may have implications later, but they're usually easy choices that are morally unambiguous and where the repercussions easy to predict. In the Banner Saga choices are not so easy. Choices that seem to be clear and easily made result in unexpected consequences sometimes immediately, sometimes not until much later in the game. Other choices are just difficult. The consequences of your choices can be serious as well. For example, one plot choice I made early in the game resulted in the death of two of my characters much later in the game. There's also the constant choice of what to do with your primary resource in the game. It's very limited and you have to decide if you are going to use it to make your characters more powerful or make sure your party can eat for another few days. You'll be sitting there, sometimes agonizing over your choices and wishing the game were more obvious but loving the fact that it isn't.  Finally, the combat. I like the system a lot. If you've played turn-based, party-focused combat games before, the basic mechanics are essentially the same. But there's enough thrown in there to change how you fight and make things interesting. For example, a unit's health and damage potential are linked (same stat) so the more a character is wounded the less damage that character can do to another character's health. This alone is an interesting element but you also have another factor with armor mitigating damage to the point where, if a character's armor is high enough, you may not be able to damage that character at all. This forces you to figure out if it's better to inflict less health damage on an enemy, making him weaker but keeping him in the fight, or if it's better to risk that same enemy being able to do higher damage to your party while you soften him up for a death blow. Add to that special abilities that are varied and can take some clever playing to set up for maximum effectiveness and you have a combat system that is both consistent enough to get the hang of and become proficient at, but also varied enough to keep things interesting.  But there is a bit of bad with the good:  First, the game is pretty short. I was actually surprised when I beat it, and for $20 I think this game could have included a bit more content. I didn't time myself but it probably took me between 12 and 15 hours to beat the game. There's some replayability with the fact that there are so many choices to be made and you could spend hours exploring them all but, being so plot-driven, once you've experienced the plot, repeated playthroughs become more mechanical than anything else.  Second, this game could have benefitted greatly from a skirmish mode. There is something of a skirmish mode with the Training Tent, but the only variables you control there are the party you bring and this is limited by where you are in the game, who you have in your party, what their levels are, and what items you've obtained. A separate skirmish mode where you could set up your own custom battles would have been perfect and enhanced the replayability of the game by giving the player the opportunity to explore all the aspects of the combat system they're interested in, or just hop in and smash some skulls for fun.  All in all, I really enjoyed this game and am excited for the sequel. If an excellent setting and interesting plot are your thing, this game has them. If you're interested in a game where your choices can have a serious impact on how your game plays, this game does that. If you're even just into turn-based combat RPGs, this is one worthy of your time.",

            "review_text": "Achievement ♥♥♥♥♥s: This is not an easy game to get 100% completion (took me around 90 hrs.). However, it is easy to get half of the achievements, give or take, with one playthrough. It took me around 6+ playthroughs to get all of the achievements (I did NOT plan it out well), and some of them are pretty tough when doing the hard mode ones.  Updated Review (07/2016): This game is worth buying if you like dark-themed, turn-based, and linear RPGs, but keep in mind some possible CONS:   -The game is fairly short for an RPG (taking my time, I beat the game in 13 hours on normal difficulty for my first playthrough).  -It has an abrupt and unresolved ending as it is episodic (The Banner Saga 2 continues the story but doesn’t finish it yet). -It is not an open world if that is what you are looking for—it is linear with auto saves (you cannot choose where and when to save, although each auto save has its own save to access if you want to try something different or screw up). -The game has a lot of reading involved (you rarely hear a person speak). In fact, this plays out similar to a point-and-click choices count story, but the turn-based fights in-between reading provide excellent strategic game play that typical point-and-click games do not.  With that said, many PROS to the game include:  -The story is dark but creative and refreshing with a unique feel and well-developed characters (be prepared to laugh, curse, and possibly cry).  -The dialogue and choices are often entertaining and feel realistic for the setting (the little bit of voice acting in the game is excellent).  -The art and score are beautiful.  -The game play/turn-based fights are addictive, and the fights even get a little challenging on the normal setting (I cursed at my monitor A LOT on hard mode, but I also like the challenge).   The game is worth multiple plays not only for achievements, but to also try out different choices as they can have a fairly large impact on the story that can transfer to the second game (The Banner Saga 2 gives you the option to continue your saves from the first game). Even though I have completed all of the achievements and played the game many times, I will probably play the game again. :]",

            "review_text": "I have finished the game, and decided to write a review afterwords so I can give you my one hundred percent honest review of this game, especially since I can recall every about it since I've just finished it.  STORY The Banner Saga is one of those games that you see it, and say, 'That looks epic.' And it really is. The story of the game is lengthy, and it took me eight hours to beat it (however, I played it on Easy which I highly recommend you play for your first playthrough, since this game is VERY unforgiving in combat later on). You switch from two groups in the game who are trying to survive in this world, which is inspired by Viking mythology and design. However, the game focuses on one after the first three or four chapters. The group that isn't the main group is about a group of varl (giant humans who have horns sticking out of their heads) trying to deliver the prince of the humans back to his home, while also having their soon to be varl with them. The main group is about a man, named Rook, trying to escape from the Dredge (stone-like golems that seem to want nothing more than death and destruction, and the end of the world) while protecting his daughter.  You play as Rook most of the game, while you sometimes go to the varl group as you see their story unfold. In the end, their paths will intertwine. That is all I can give about the story without giving spoilers, but I will say it's one of the greatest stories I've ever seen in a videogame. And the game had even surprised me many times with emotional moments, which I didn't expect in a game like this.  GAMEPLAY The gameplay of the game is very simple. Outside of combat, you make choices by clicking on one of the options of what to do. And I will say, there is no voice acting in this game. Some voice acting comes up when they talk about a town, since you must travel from town-to-town while managing supplies and morale (like Oregon Trail, but easier). Conversations should the characters speak to one another, but you merely read the words. To me, it felt like reading a visual novel, but yet it was so well done. In combat, you also use the mouse. The combat is turn-based RPG, where units have armor and strength (health). If you damage armor, you can basically kill enemies in one hit by hitting their strength afterwards. However, you get numbers of how much your unit will take off, and it's very nice and clean. The combat animations are slick, and characters look fantastic in the art design the game has done. Combat can take up to five minutes, or twenty depending on how good you are at strategy, which you don't have to worry as much in Easy mode. The battles at first are simple and easy, but later on you will get your ♥♥♥♥ kicked, because the Dredge are powerful and sometimes unfair on higher difficulties. So, if you're playing the game for the first time, play it on Easy. You will enjoy it a lot more.  DESIGN As I've stated, the game looks gorgeous with it's hand-drawn graphics that are breath-taking at moments. Everything fits together, and everybody looks different in the game, despite on character who you don't get more then ten minutes, so it's fine. Every character looks like they could be real, and the game actually makes you care about these characters, So if you make a choice that kills one, or one just dies in battle, you really do feel the emotional impacts. You have the characters you love, and the characters that annoy you, and the characters you hate. It really does feel like a visual novel in a way, but with choices and some fighting including some RPG elements, but it does a fine job of making worth playing.  VERDICT The Banner Saga is one of the games that you can't wait for the sequel to come out (especially since the only thing that stunk was that it ended suddenly, and will pick off in the game with your choices, so we can only hope the next game[s] are as good as this one) and truly surpirsed me. It shows that RPG turn-based combat works really well for an amazing story that this game has. You feel connected to the characters, and when one dies, you feel that emotional impact as you can even cry sometimes. Sure, it doesn't have fancy cutscenes and has a lot of reading, but it's one of the best RPG games out there, and I will be waiting for when the next game comes out, and probably praise that game too. 9/10 ",

It's gritty, and the crunches of axes breaking armor and the grunts and moans of the injured make you feel it. People are fragile and the perpetual march is exhausting, and the heavy shambling motions of bodies shows you so. As the leader, you constantly have to arbitrate the problems of your followers, keep them optimistic, keep them fed, and keep them alive while a continent of panicking and desperate people is being overrun.

The story is engaging but you're not very free in big decisions, if you're looking for a game where you can construct your own story you shouldn't bother with this one. Nonetheless I enjoyed the story and found it very engaging. One of the things i disliked was the occasionaly small dicisions you had to make without any idea of the consequences which could be very punishing.  Overall highly recommended!!",

            "review_text": "The most remarkable aspect of this game is presentation. From the soundtrack to the art direction to the interface, everything is immaculate and elegant. Nothing feels rough around the edges or half-finished as far as those elements go. The gameplay is unique- a combination of choose-your-own-adventure style frequent decision-making, an Oregan Trail-like survival and travel element that involves some resource management, and the battle system itself which involves tactical strategy and some interesting components like individual health and defense bars to attack, and the Varl race of characters who take up a lot of unit space in battle but have high attack power. There are so many characters to choose from during battle- as many as 20 are encountered by game's end and even character usage involves some decision-making as characters only level up by not only actively participating, but getting in a number of kills.  Now for some of the downsides- though there are such a plethora of options and routes to go on, nearly all lead toward the same end and plot points seem black and white in nature- you either picked the 'right' answer leading to hidden items or a surplus in resources, or you picked the wrong one which can set you back in progress. But making wrong decisions matters little since the difficulty level is low until the end, and the initially interesting tactics-driven combat is actually quite simplified compared to other strategy RPGs. Aspects such as equipment management involve collecting numerous accessories and each character can hold just one. Character classes and stat allocation is similarly straightforward. On the bright side, that makes this title a great choice for those new to the genre and not very interested in micro-management.   The storyline is interesting and involved, but there is not much clarification of the lore. While the character and plot development is nicely done, it can be vague with some side characters receiving barely a line of exposition. While I compared the decision-making to a choose-your-own-adventure novel, it has nowhere near the verbosity of visual novels or many story-driven RPGs. The writing is of an appreciably high standard of quality though and the lack of meandering over any particular element (whether it be storytelling or the various types of gameplay present here) keeps the game fast-paced.   I achieved completion at around 10 hours and do feel there is some replay value here, but the general asking price ($24.99) is very high for this amount of content. I would suggest waiting for a sale of at least 30-50% off. The exception being if the subject matter is particularly riveting to you, in which case I'd say go ahead as it is likely to impress.",

            "review_text": "The Banner Saga is fantastic from start to finish. Been sitting in my pile of games to play for a while, and I'm glad I finally go around to checking it out. This game combines a rich story set in a nordic mythology, turn-based combat that harkens to X-com, and survival decisions that remind me of the old Oregon Trail.  Three great things about the game: - Decisions matter. They shape the way your party forms over the course of a solid 12-14 hour story. - A solid combat system that keeps action interesting - Fantastic story of the end times  It's not without a few faults however. The surival-ESQUE gameplay is definitely in service to the story. Things like caravan supplies and army size feel inconsequential at times. Sometimes you will spend a bunch of currency on supplies for a long haul... only to have the supplies made meaningless by cutting a long journey short due to a story element.   Other times you make sacrifices to keep your army numbers high, only never to fight or encounter another large army. Why? Because the story didn't call for you to run into an army yet. I would have much rather used the currency buy items or upgrade my party members. But there's no way to know when supplies and army size are actually needed, before you actually need them... making their currency system a bit of random guesswork  The story is good, so the above points are forgivable, but I would have liked to see them strike a better balance between the story, and the game-y parts.  You should buy this game. You will enjoy it. Can't wait to play The Banner Saga 2.",

Trust this person, or this person, and if you trust the wrong one, then you could get betrayed. Sacrifice your travelling companions for your combat party, or risk yourselves for the better good. It truly started making me start questioning every decision, and really makes you question yourself as a leader.  Rook, basically the main character (theres a bunch of little storylines in there, but you are mostly playing as Rook), was simply a hunter, seeking to live a safe quiet life while protecting his daughter, when suddenly you are attacked and the leader of your small village is killed, and suddenly, everyone looks to you as the new leader. Thrust into your sudden leadership role, you must make tough decisions, that only get tougher as you go from leading a mere couple of dozen people to leading over 300-400+, all while seeking to protect the group and your daughter, and seek salvation.  As for the combat, the strategy is a bit tough to get used to, but incredibly well done, and makes you start depending on your team, but that can go badly if you make a poor decision and get one of those main allies killed. Leveling up is well done, especially since your 'Renown' which you have to spend each time you level up and buy stuff like supplies and items, is not gained in huge amounts, but not gained in small amounts, making more decisions on whether you want to level up now, or spend some renown to get some more food supplies, which you might need, or risk running out of food before the next opportunity to get more.  As for the length, I found the game pleasently long, but not too long as to feel boring. The interesting interactions going on between characters made me not even notice how long I'd be playing, and that is something I really like. The other thing is that due to the sheer amount of choices you have, I almost want to go back through and play again just to make different choices.  However, about the one issue i had with this game is whenever you are travelling, all you can do is simply watch, and the environment is not much to watch, and there are times where you will travel for like 2 game days without anything happening, which kind of kills the pace of the game at times.  Overall, I very highly recommend this game. It's more than just a game, its truly what makes gaming great, showing that games can be art and entertaining.",

            "review_text": "The Banner Saga is an adventure game featuring basic RPG elements and a Norse/Viking theme, where the player leads a caravan of civilians and warriors across a wilderness while trying to escape constant attacks by a race of metallic creatures called Dredge.  There's an enjoyable turn based combat system that has some tactical depth. Battles take place on a square grid, and the player has a party of up to 6 warriors. You'll often start the fight outnumbered, but the movement order is similar to chess where the player moves one unit, then the AI moves one unit, and so on, which means having less units isn't necessarily a disadvantage.  Each warrior has two main characteristics - strength and armour. Strength represents both the amount of damage inflicted by a successful attack, and the health of the warrior. When strength reaches zero the warrior is knocked out of the fight, but it also means a warrior who is close to death will do less damage. Armour indicates how difficult it is to successfully damage a unit's strength - if their armour is higher than your strength, you probably won't hit, so sometimes you need to weaken the enemy's armour first before you can actually hurt them.  Positioning is also important. Varl (giants) take up 4 grid spaces instead of 1 and can easily block the movement of both friendly and enemy warriors. Archers have weaker armour so its a good idea to keep them behind melee units. My one complaint about the combat is the lack of variety. Pretty much every unit for both your side and the Dredge, is either melee or archer. There's hardly any offensive magic, and no healing, so most fights play out the same way from a tactical point of view.  Outside of combat you'll have choices to make when certain events happen. Most choices have consequences, which could be good or bad. For example you might encounter another group of people on the road who want to join you, and you can accept or refuse. If you accept, you might gain warriors, or they might steal some of your food. If you refuse, they might leave peacefully or they might just attack you.  The story is okay. It starts slow but gets better after a couple of hours. I never really cared about any of the Varl characters, their personalities didn't develop beyond 'I'm a warrior and want to kill stuff', but I did like the main two Humans, Rook and Alette. Their father/daughter relationship at least gave me a reason to care about keeping them alive.  However, the game loses points for presentation. There are lots of nicely animated cutscenes of people walking in a straight line through the snow, but unfortunately as soon as any action happens, its either described by a wall of text, or through dialogue scenes between motionless character portraits - the majority of which has no voice acting.  Overall The Banner Saga is a decent game, but I wouldn't class it as a 'must play'. If you enjoy turn based combat it should entertain you for the 10 hours needed to finish the campaign, but you might want to wait for a sale.",

Again about the combat another thing is that there is some serious stratagy going on here with pre battle placement, consideration of battle order on your side of things and of course how you want to approach each enemy, do i want to get that armor or hp down? the combat is great and engagageing and i love it and i am often aproaching it like a game of chess. Ive only played about 2-3 hours now but so far i am in love with the game and look forward to spending FAR more time with it.",

            "review_text": "This immersive, story-driven strategy game will take you into the winter frostlands of kings and vikings. Beautifully crafted character animations and backgrounds make this game a moving work of art.   The Banner Saga plays like a standard tactical strategy game, with tile squares and a good variety units with unique abilities. Your goal is to utilize your characters in the most effective way in combat to reduce casualties and ensure the longetivity of your clan.  Morever, the game comes with a unique consequence system that obligates you to apply yourself to being a true leader of a fragile alliance between Varls (vikings) and humans, in the onslaught of incoming evil. However, it should be added, there are plenty of possibilities where you can evade those duties. These sequences brought out the most dramatic, seat-gripping suspense that will make The Banner Saga a rememberal experience.   The only short coming to this game is that the storyline was too intriguing, and therefore when the story cut short, with much of the legacy untold, I was left dissapointed and wanting more. However, this is a similar feeling to most good games I have played, so this does not make The Banner Saga any less of a good experience.  I hope you enjoy.",

Looking at the majestic landscape while running for your life will create all kinds of weird feelings in you. When you combine it with truly beautiful soundtrack, interesting story full of hard choices and unforeseen events (which will break your heart more than your caravan) you'll get remarkable experience which you wont forget.  From the gameplay point of view it's not that great. The item progression is really weak, at the beginning you have nothing (duh) for a long time, and at some point you just have truckload of stuff, more often than not with high level requirements, so most of your characters can't wear them.  The learning curve is kinda weird, because it takes time to find out what it's all about. And by the time when you do understand the game, it's too late and most of your characters have bad stats.  Combat system tries to by original. You have strength, armor and willpower attributes and in most cases you have to bring armor down to inflict more strength damage. The most important thing is to group enemies together so you can inflict AoE damage. Although this system is original, I don't find it particularly enjoyable. It's extremely repetitive and to me, it doesn't make much sense. Difficulty levels are all over the place, which can get frustrating really fast. I finished the game and I still don't understand how could they inflict such a huge damage to my Varls.  Maybe it's just that I'm stupid and every other gamer out there understood it right away, but when I look at the forums it certainly doesn't look like it.  All things consider, I really thing that it's a game worth playing because of the story and atmosphere. But the game mechanics could be a lot better.",

The game has really original battle system, where character's HP = strength - the lesser HP you have, the weaker your punches to enemy. Morale system can significantly boost your warriors in places when you need to hit first or run away from enemy's reinforcements.  But most of all, I've enjoed the main plot. It's a legend! You have 2 parallel main stories, one with main protagonist and another with secondary protagonist. In every game event you can choose from several choices and each choice has different consequences for main hero and caravan. You have several heroes under your command: warriors, archers, mages, spearmans and other, so choose your party wisely.  Cartoon graphics and soundtrack are also a masterpiece, I loved those ethnic songs from northern legends.  The game is so damn hard even on Normal difficulty, lack of food, rest, equipment and army make you to think harder on every decicion - to fight those bandits, search for gold or try to find food for your caravan?  Waiting impatiently for the second part of the story!  + Great epic plot (try not to cry in end of first part) + Stylish cartoon graphics and soundtrack + Original fresh battle system and skills. + Wide variety of decisions + Fair base price (only 5$ with 75% discount) + Stunning game difficulty (if you tired from casual easy games) + First caravan game I've ever played   - Poor game budget (it was made by 3 developers) - Short first part of the story (~10-20 hours) - I wish if the game had more battles - Lack of food  9/10 stars to Kickstarter blockbuster!",

            "review_text": "I have just finished the game and I have to say I am so in ♥♥♥♥ing aw that I have to write this review.  The good: + Art style and animations: The game is visually incredible. The hand-drawn animations are splendid in cut scenes, dialogues and combats.  + The atmosphere: The Banner Saga’s mood is somber overall and it goes perfectly well with the art direction. Also, there is something so captivating about watching tiny people marching through the frozen mountainous land. + The soundtrack: Emotionally and eargasm material, the music contributes a great deal to the atmosphere of the game. + The characters: Most of the characters in the game are fascinating with compelling background story. Too bad the story is short and some characters don’t stick around long enough for you to know them better. + The lore and setting: The developers has established massive and in-depth lore which you can read about or discover as the game proceed. I find the Viking setting of the game quite unique and remarkable.  + That ♥♥♥♥ing boat scene.  The so-so +/- Gameplay: The Banner Saga uses a combat system resembles some classic SRPG games with a twist. You use a party of maximum 6 heroes to fight in a gridded, chess-like field. Each characters has 2 main stats: Strenght and Armor. Strength determine an unit’s health and attack, meanwhile armor determines your defense. The more strength an unit has, the harder he hits and vice versa. The more armor you has, the less damage you will take and you can ward off an attack completely if your armor is significantly higher than the attacking unit’s strength. Doing armor damage does not reduce health but it does reduce the enemies’ defenses, thus makes them more vulnerable. In addition of strength and armor, each heroes also has willpower. Willpower can be spent to make an unit move farther, deal more damage or using special ability. You and your opponent take turn to move and take action until there is one last person standing of either side. The less people you has in play, the more actions 1 character can take, so you can use 1 or 2 powerful characters over and over again before the enemy can react. Imho, the turn order is the biggest exploitable flaw in the combat system. The caravan section demands you to balance between your supply, renown and morale of your clan during your journey. Supply sustain your clanmen and army, the larger your caravan, the more supply is consumed each day. If your supply reaches 0, the number of people in your caravan and your morale will diminish harshly with each day passes. Renown is the only currency in the game, which can be used to upgrade your heroes, buy equipment or buy more supply. Morale determines how well your heroes perform in combat, high morale give you booste in willpower during combat and vice versa. Your morale will slowly recede as your caravan travel but it can be boosted by halt your march and rest (consumes however many days worth of supplies you spend resting). The resources in the game are extremely scarce and play brutally important role on how your game progresses. +/- Difficulty: The game is hard and unforgiving, even in the beginning.  +/- Story and narrative progression: The campaign is line near, but as the story processes, you will be given various choices, some are petty and insignificant, some are morally difficult and make huge impacts on your journey later on. The game is short and seems a little bit rushed, but the replay value is huge with the variety outcomes of the array of decisions given throughout the game. +/- No permadeath: You may still lose your heroes outside of combats as a result of a wrong decision.  The bad:  - There are some minor bugs that may occur during combat, which can be irritating at times.    The Banner Saga is one of the best strategy game I have played in recent years. It is an extraordinary visual-audio experience but it could use some improvement in the combat system.   Strongly recommended and looking forward to the sequel ",

Add one part Song of Fire and Ice (game of thrones), one part Vikings, and one part Ogre Battle and you have this game. About 75% of the game is spent in combat - turn-based strategy that is fairly interesting but don't expect anything as good as Final Fantasy tactics. The other 25% is spent in the metagame of managing your troops via interactions, across the snowy north. By that I mean making important D&amp;D style decisions that have a very meaningful impact.  Example: You have 700 troops and the enemy number over 1000 in the tree line. You will soon be surrounded. What do you do? 1 Rush for the next town and try to lose them. (risk losing troops and supplies) 2 Charge the enemy head on (engage in turn-based battle) to create a diversion and save some troops. 3 Instruct your fire archer to set the forest ablaze to create a getaway. (dice roll, I permanently lost my only archer this way) 4 Lead the enemy further into the forest and then light in on fire.  5 Order your troops to make a defensive formation.  There are also animated interactions on the field and in town, wherein choices you make will have a direct impact on how much money, troop count, or loyalty you will lose/gain. The game forces you to make tough decisions and there is -NO- returning to a save point, you must live with each crippling lost battle, or bad decision you make.   The art is fantastic, as is the storyline. It's a beautiful RPG in every sense of the word. At $25 it was really expensive but I wanted to support this dev. It's easily worth $10 on a steam sale.",

WIN  I was expecting a solid and enjoyable game when I heard that a few former Bioware employees turned their backs on EA to provide us RPG fans with an experience we won't forget too soon. As it turned out, this is my favourite game of this year so far.  Even though I enjoyed every aspect of the game, I am well aware that it won't appeal to everybody by its' text driven storytelling and scarce, yet quite beautiful, animations. For someone who lacks the imagination or has a hard time of following the story only by text rather than fancy cutscenes it might be the wrong product. I too had some problems with diving into it at the beginning, but once I got used to it it felt like a virtual adventure book enriched by a beautiful scenery, interesting, yet sometimes stereotypical, characters and an incredible soundtrack which sets the mood for every scene and intensifies the games' atmosphere in an astounding way. The game itself consists of two game aspects which complement one another quite well.   The first one is the tactical turn based combat and is provided with a good variety of different characters/classes and, in my opinion, good balanced and fleshed out mechanics. Each and every unit on the battlefield has five attributes which bring important utility to the fight. The most important are   strength  and   armor . Armor mitigates the received damage by the amount of armour your unit had and strength determines the amount of damage your character can dish out. But there is a catch, your points in strength are also your hit points which means if a character gets hurt, his damage diminishes for the same amount. The same rules count for your enemies as well. The third attribute is  break  and defines how much armor you are able to crush with an armor breaking attack. To explain this, there are three types of offensive actions, a standard attack which attacks the strenght of your opponent, a crushing attack which focuses your targets' armour and a special ability, each class has its own, which provide a special effect. And the last two attributes are  willpower  and  exertion , the first one provides a pool of points which can be spent on your attacks to deal more damage or on one of your abilities. The latter defines how much willpower can be spend per turn. A big, but only, downside of the tactical combat is the lack of obstacles on the battlefields.  The second part of the game is the strategic layer and forces you to manage your caravan and warriors. On your journey you will be confronted with various moral choices which could endanger the safety of your people. The most important part is to keep the moral of your fellowship raised, your food supply steady and your warriors healthy, but often those goals will be very conflicting and it is your job to find a good balance.  All in all it is one damn fine polished 'indie' experienced and only the first of three chapters of this saga, with the second part already on its way.",

The cause and effect style to the story really makes the player (myself) think long and hard about choices before rapidly doing things. Slow to start, Chapters 1 and 2 introduce you to the two main stories, which, by the end of the game merge to become one story, which I quite frankly love. The game on normal difficulty, is not hard, but does not baby you past the initial tutorial, some battles, especially the last, can prove to be a struggle, and may cause losses, injuries, or a need to rethink your strategies for later battles. The game is quite... real, it doesn't beat around the bush with the story. It really feels like the end of the world. When you have maybe 350 clansmen, 140 warriors and 60 varl in your caravan, with limited supplies running, you're forced to be conservative at most times and on occasion, be the polar opposite, offensive and assertive, to gain supplies from meek farmers. The characters really interact with your decisions too and tug on how you want to convey yourself as a character to those close to you. All in all an excellent game. 10/10 Gameplay, 11/10 story and I absolutely love the 'cause and effect'-esque mechanics. Nothing like having to really think before performing actions. The replay value is excellent as well, to see how you could play differently to get different reactions from characters, the caravans, or to earn new heroes from placing yourself in more 'immediate' danger.",

Loved the artwork and presentation , very polished game. The combat was the weakest part but at least it also was different than the norm , it definetly takes some getting used to .   The worst thing about the combat is how turns and rounds work , each unit doesnt take a turn every round as you would expect , instead each side always has the same amount of moves , so you can end up with the ridiculous situation of the side with lower numbers being better of as each unit gets to move multiple times. Also the fact you are better wounding units than killing them is stupid as well. You get used to this and play around it but it is for me a silly combat system that never feels right.",

It leaves a true sense of addictive desperation considering the gameplay is very strategic aka final fantasy tactics like but much more brutal.

The game is capable of being challenging at times without being unfair (I only played on hard), but there was a sudden jump in difficulty for the final boss that left me frustrated for a long time until I finally won. I will say better management of renown and coordinating level ups would have helped there. One of the few games where I actually felt choices I made had an effect, although they are ultimately small and do not change the story greatly; they add small things such as hidden items, avoiding/causing fights, etc. Overall I would highly recommend this game.",

The ending is very climactic, great boss battle. The climax at the end is great, really does wrap up a certain aspect of this journey the game makes you feel like you have gone on. However, there are totally still open stories that are.... not cliffhanger, your little thing is wrapped up, but theres so much more going on in the world that they totally left it open for a sequel. I do wish it was longer, another 4 hours would have been perfect. Throughout the game you switch between two perspectives and journeys, eventually they meet up, if they had shown the other partys journey leadng up to the last stretch where they meet and engage the boss that would have been perfect. I really wish they had done that. I think they should have added a little more onto the end, more of an epilogue to show how some of the choices you made directly prior to the last battle effected your caravan. however, despite wanting more I was still satisfied and accomplished after my story wrapped up. The story is certainly gripping, and you do connect with the characters, I thought one was going to die and i legitimately jumped in my chair and was breathing quickly and was overall disrought. The choices absolutely matter, with the exception of the last few before the final fight. Music is great, there just isnt enough of it. Sounds awesome, give me more. Combat I was very satisfied with. I played through on normal my first run. Challenging at times, was able to win alot of them easily, but I also lost a few here and there, and I dont think I truly began to master it till the end of the game. The combat is fun the whole time, doesnt get old, and I still feel that I can get better at it despite having beaten it once. Things like lining up your men for a shield wall, and lining up your enemies for aoe, peircing, and arcing add several layers to combat. I do wish it was longer, I want more music, and I definitely want more character customizatioon with items and how you level.

Gameplaywise it is very classic and not quite complex in both its RPG- as well as strategy elements. Especially the text windows feel very old school. Reminded me a bit of 'Choose Your Own Adventure'-books. This classic style is very fitting and I enjoyed it very much. There are not many games like this anymore, after all. Because you don't have the option to save yourself and the latest save is always overwritten, with only some key points permanently being saved, you have to live with your decisions and their eventual bad outcome.

            "review_text": "The Banner Saga is a game I saw early in development and was excited to get when it came out. Having now played it, I can't say I'm disapointed - but I'm not enthusiastic either. Before I continue, I want to point out that I DO recommend this game - but not at $25. Wait until the price drops or it goes on sale unless you have a lot of money to spend on games and are particularly excited for this one.  *REVIEW MAY CONTAIN MINOR SPOILERS. READ AT OWN RISK*  I'll begin my review by mentioning the good.  *The game's artwork is beautiful and so is the soundtrack. I've left the game on a few times just to listen to the soundtrack, which is both haunting and very fitting for the game. As someone who is a pretentious jerkoff I feel the art fits the game and setting wonderfully and really makes one feel a bit chilly (but maybe that's just the real life weather). Character design also generally varies, while remaining historical feeling with no fan service.  *The plot is well-done and plays into Celtic/Norse mythology without being a rip-off or generic with new Gods and new legends. It also gives you a very real feel that this is the end of the world and at times helpless and I couldn't help but want more. Most of the characters are also likable or at least interesting, leaving you to actually care about them and what happens to them.  *Battle mechanics are interesting, and as someone who doesn't usually like turn based fighting, I found them fun and challenging but not impossible. It's also got a lot of fun little creative points and I often was craving another challenging battle. Most special abilities are actually useful and no stat feels unimportant when leveling. It's also a (nice) difficulty sink, at least in my opinion, that you can 'break' a character by putting points in incorrectly (sorry, Gunnulf!).  *Random events are exhilirating without being exhausting for I found it was usually common sense which ones would lead to negative outcomes. Most don't feel forced in either; it seems like something you could easily run into. Losing characters over ♥♥♥♥♥♥ things you can't help is a nice touch of realism.  *The over-all mechanics generally blended well into a relatively fun game.  That said, there's probably more bad than good - which took what could of been a replayable new 'favorite' and made it a one-time playthrough. This is acceptable (and something I can still feel comfortable recommending, if only while on sale) because that one playthrough will probably give you 8-15 hours of game play and you may get a second if you're big into achievements and side paths but it still is a bit of a disapointment.  *It often felt like I was playing a choose-your-own-adventure book turned video game rather than an actual open-ended game that allowed me to make decisions and effect the outcome. While your decisions do make an impact and it's easy to effect things greatly there are still only two (very slightly different) endings and no one is bothered deeply if you mess up. If you ♥♥♥♥ off one person or someone dies no one else cares. If your morale is high or low no one mentions it. It all feels unconnected and gives you little reason to do the smaller things, because after that one decision is done and made - it's rarely brought up again.  If you let an important character die, it won't make it harder from a plot point. It just will make battles harder and maybe upset you if it was a favorite. There are a few exceptions, but usually these are majorly negative events which make you regret taking someone onto your team - rather than making anything easier or opening up a new path.   If you've played a Fallout game, you'll know what it's like to have 'real world'-esque consequences, where you'll help one person or hurt one and have it benefit or hinder you later on. There's very little of that in The Banner Saga despite it advertising itself as 'every decision effecting you'. You can tell there's little difference in the major plot regardless of what you do and with there being practically no 'side material' you don't even get that.  Some examples include taking on a monster baby, only to never have it effect you again; or stealing food from farmers and upsetting your daughter, but never having her mention it again. Will decisions sometimes matter? Yes, but not that much and not that often. The biggest benefit is when a child you rescue warns you about enemies later on, but that's really it.  *Side plots don't exist.   Or rather, they just don't matter. In fact, neither does the main plot. The Banner Saga is the first of a three-part series and if you don't plan on buying all three - and care at all for the plot - don't buy the first. The major plot points (such as the destruction of the planet and the sun not moving) are never resolved and subplots (such as who kills a king) aren't either.   The only plot you see through to the end is the safety of (one) of the caravans you escort; which, if you thought was a side plot and spent more time tending to your heroes probably isn't that safe anyway. You get your people to safety, but it's temporary at best and nothing else happens, leaving you at a cliff hanger and feeling a bit ripped off. It isn't an overly long game either, so it isn't like things were dragging on and needed a break.  The game feels like going to a movie that was sliced into parts to force people to buy more than one ticket, not like a stand alone title.  I feel if the above issue wasn't combined with the one before it, the two would sort of even one another out. If there were tons of side plots you finished up where your decisions really mattered it'd be fine for it to end with none of the bigger things resolved; or if the major plot was resolved, I don't think I'd care about my lack of control on the story.   Many decision games have replay ability because there's so many small options and so many quests to do in different ways, unlocking more dialog and so on. There isn't that here, limiting an already limited game.   *You're often faced with the difficult decision of whether you should level your characters, buy items, or feed your caravan - and as most items do relatively little for the price, it really becomes a two way decision.  Feeding your caravan makes a few end-game bits easier and mid-game fights less challenging if you're bad at fighting with your heroes, but leveling your characters (and just a few) is ultimately more important unless you want the end boss fight to be almost impossible. That said though, even then you have a gamble - because heroes sometimes come and go, even if you make the right decision - and leveling the wrong ones could leave you high and dry regardless.  With how hard the 'currency' is to come across, it's often frustrating rather than difficult. You'll finish the game either way so it isn't 'hard', it's just annoying.  *One of my biggest issues is a really stupid one, but people will begin starving the SECOND you run out of food by the dozens. I wish they offered an option to ration food at the cost of morale and that morale did more. It would of added some depth of options in a game that gives you very little to actually do.  *No save game makes it so you often are FORCED to play until a certain point and can't simply make a decision for fun and then go back and redo it. Undoing a single mistake can force you to replay two hours of the game, a feature that's annoying. I wish it could be turned on and off, perhaps at the cost of an achievement, rather than being a frustrating difficulty sink.  (Con in comments)",

Keep in mind this is not an AAA game with hundreds of different units separated in different factions, however it has three great points on it's favor:  1.- Combat system is refreshing, having to decide on every moment if attack to reduce health and damage of an enemy or try to reduce it's resistance to damage.  Different special abilites on each hero, a truly sense of tank units and damage units fighting on a different way each one and the 'Telltale battle' game make the action different from other games on the field and quite fun.  2.- Design of the game is just gorgeous. It can lack expensive cinematics, but the compelling story, the comic stetic and the little details will make you love it.  3.- Out of combat, the game is something similar to those old 'choose your own adventure' books. Several events come across your caravan where you are presented with different options to decide. This could seem a bit boring for those in need of a more hardcore tactical movement (there is no tactical map) but adds a lot of replayability, as different decisions make for different story paths.  This game probably won't replace your most loved tactical AAA games, but surely worths each penny you invest in it. I like the idea to help small studies capable of doing games like this to keep on surprising me day by day with more jewels like this.",

            "review_text": "The Banner Saga is a good game. The art is absolutely FANTASTIC, and really makes a huge difference in how much I enjoyed this game. The tactics gameplay is great, very strategic and challenging. Your health and damage share the same stat, and then you have armor which mitigates damage at a 1:1 ratio (1 armor = -1 damage). When attacking you choose to either attack their health/damage, or their armor (which uses your armor break stat). It's a great system imo, not to mention all the different classes special abilities and items you can equip and some other gameplay elements. Anything you're doing outside of combat is Oregon Trail, or cutscene/conversation. The Oregon Trail aspect is really fun, but I found it to be more fun than stressful by the end of the game. Things just start getting so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and you feel like bad things are happening every 30seconds and there is little you can do to help yourself. Of course, maybe I just made some terrible choices.   The game took me 18 hours to complete, with a few of these hours going into battle contemplation and decision making only. Even so, the game felt somehow short, and endly abruptly, as others have said. My biggest complaint is that I felt like a lot went to waste in this game. I don't plan on playing it again; I have many other games to try. And I ended the game with pretty much only one full line-up at lvl 3-5, never had enough renown (exp and money currency) to buy ANY items that were for sale, and never had enough to work on leveling my other party characters. I pretty much was only able to spend the renown to buy BARELY enough supplies for the road (often still not enough), and level up my main characters. There is plenty of replay value here, but I am not interested in another playthrough.  Overall: good game, great art, great gameplay, pretty cool story/setting/dialogue/characters, but gets a little old near the end, ends abruptly, and I didnt get to try out a lot of characters, classes, items etc. because of the scarcity of renown. They really shoulda made the xp and money 2 different currencies. But regardless, much respect for this game, it was a fun new experience.",

I did not know untill after I finished the game and did a little research to find out that my questions would not be answered untill the next 2 games.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------  What You are about to delve into is a game that is highly simular to MECC's 1974 classic 'The Oregon trail' It is about the Journey you take with your warriors and clansmen through the harsh Nordic landscape while you manage things like food, Morale, and rank. Tough choices await you, and allys you come to know can and will die. Wheather you are playing on the side of Rook, or of the varl Hakon, Go with your gut and play the game like you feel you would.   Combat is played out in turn-based tactics style a la FFT/vandal hearts. Fights earn you renown whitch is the currency you use in town to purchase items, and food to make shure your party doesnt starve. You have to strike a balance though, if your party is too weak in combat, you may never make it to the end. Half the fun in a way, is the fact that this game doesnt let you save. It forces you to make your decisions and live with them, so you can think of all the coulda/shoulda/whoulda's after the chapters end.   This game does need a bit of polish in it's combat system, but I have a feeling that this will all be ironed out later on in the next game. If you end up playing I have 2 tips for you:  (spoiler alert) 1. Do Not let Onef join you.  2. Dont use any of your renown buying supplies in the first town on rook's story. (You'l end up looseing it all anyway)",

Also vikings. Think chess mixed with a western rpg for a good comparison. It's a turn by turn strategy game that is a lot deeper than it may look at the start. Each class has a special ability and every character can be leveled up, but leveling up requires the use of your 'renown' which is limited and, depending on how you play, can easily be depleted as that same resource is used to buy items and food for your journey. The battles have a very interesting armor vs strength mechanic that is great to play with. Essentially you have health and strength represented by the same stat and armor represented by another. You can choose to weaken the armor so you can do more damage or attempt to go straight for the health. This adds a very unique dynamic to the battles that I never had experienced before.  The story, which is a 'choices-matter (but not really)' type game, starts out rather small like many games do. You start out on a simple escort type mission. Playing as a Varl (the half-man half-beast giant things) you are escorting the prince of men on a trip back to the human capital, but along the way there something happens and the story expands from there eventually ending with a 'fate-of-the-world' story. It is very reminiscent of Bio-ware games or RPG's in general as that's what they're known for. The majority of the game takes place in battles while the second largest part will be eaten up by waiting for your caravan to reach a marker or town. Along the way there you will get random encounters with story and decision that directly effect your caravan and what happens down the line too. These decisions may not effect the main story at all but seeing little sub-stories unfold based off my decisions was a really good feeling and reminded me a lot of dragon age: origins (one of the best games ever I might add but that's a different discussion.)   The art and animation for this game is absolutely beautiful and literally bleeds the emotion and feeling put into the making of it. Overall the game is great. The combat takes some getting used to and the fights can be unbalanced but adapting and learning is part of the fun. If you have the money to spare get this game! You won't regret it",

Banner Saga is a RPG-TBS similar to Final Fantasy Tactics, Disgaea, and X-Com Enemy Unknown. While not as in depth, you do need to consider how your characters develop and carefully navigate battles. When not in the fight, your cast of characters are traversing the icy plains and dangerous mountains while avoiding the hordes of an evil army known as the Dredge. Along the way, you make tough choices that can result in rewards, death or departure of characters, and some that leave you completely oblivious to the results.  With a beautiful setting and graphic style, a lovely and fitting soundtrack, my only problem was that this game was too short. For $20, about 7 hours of gameplay before I beat the game was disappointing. There was so much lore and so much more of the map that I was hoping would be explored, but the game abruptly and unexpectedly ends. If $20 is too much, then you can get it on mobile devices for $10.

The plot wasn't as emotionally stunning since I knew what was going to happen, but the beautiful animations and music still helped draw out feelings for the characters. Overall the gameplay, graphics, and music combine to create a world so immersively desperate you can't help but be drawn in.  The gameplay is a mix of three systems: a choose your own adventure style story where your choices can definitely impact the future story and other characters, a caravan management system where you try to balance your need for food, fighters, and heroes, and (the majority of the gameplay) a turn based tactical/strategy RPG that contains serious quirks that set it apart from other SRPGs. You use one currency to both level up heroes and purchase new items for them to use as well as buy supplies for your caravan, and the choices you make can effect your caravan management and tactical fighting, so all of the systems twine nicely together. That said, the caravan management feels like the biggest miss of the three--very small seeming decisions can impact your caravan much more than how you spend your resources.   Several reviews are critical of the tactical fighting aspect and while they bring up some valid points overall I found the fighting to be enjoyable throughout all of two playthroughs. The main criticism I've seen is that the enemy types lack variety which leads to similar strategies working consistently. Overall I agree and wish that there were more different enemies or terrains to force you to mixup your tactics more. That said I found the fights overall engaging throughout, and found the normal difficulty appropriately hard--not a cakewalk by any means but also not impossible.   I hope that the future releases help expand the tactical options in fights and build the caravan management into a more robust system that feels more impactful on gameplay. I definitely recommend this game to any strategy rpg fans, fans of norse folklore, or fans of good storytelling games. I definitely felt that the amount of time and enjoyment I've got for the money I spent at full price to be well worth it. I'm off to try the second game.",

The game feels rather short, and the story can be quite confusing at times; for the most parts, I stopped caring about the story after a while.   Game is perfect aesthetically and gameplay-wise; the game is absolutely beautiful in my honest opinion, and the battles are fun with a good mix of characters. Characters are well written, for the most parts, but they don't meld well with the story sometimes. Music is used sparingly to create atmosphere, and it really hits you when it is there.

As I said, you will pass almost the entire game appreciating the art and the background musics, which I forget to say it's incredible, one of the most, if not the most, beautiful game I've ever seen, and it's ambientation is perfect. Weirdly, some parts of the animated characters seems like they forget to finish or don't have the time to complete it, for exempla at the beginning of the game you already can see an character that it's hand have a different line from the rest of the character, line that seems like the pencil from Paint, but nothing that can't be ignored easily.

            "review_text": "While this was a good game, I don't believe it was a great game. The combat style, while very cool and fun in the beginning, quickly plays itself out. The main problem is the lack of variety of enemies. When you are fighting a robot hoarde, it quickly becomes grindy and difficult when the variety of attacks is so limited and their vulnerabilities are nil. That is not to say I think they should have gone the route of weaknesses-to-elementals approach, but something at least to switch it up a little. The other problem I found was the difficulty curve. It goes from easy fights to nearly impossible fairly quickly. Some of the characters with the nicer special attacks come in later in the game, resulting in you having to 'game' the fights to get those characters to make the final 'kill-shot' to get the options for promotions. Probably, an old RPG cumulative 'XP' would have been better than one character getting full credit for getting the parting killing shot off.  The final battle is especially difficult unless you have your characters really leveled up by that point. Letting you take Rook or Alette out of the mix for the whole game and then requiring that both be in your posse for the toughest battle felt rather short-sighted by the developer. That being said, since Alette had such horrible specials and was overall mediocre in combat (as well as being whiny, uninteresting, and seemed to have her mouth perpetually open like some gormless mouthbreather), I didn't use her or level her at all, and therefore, was unable to choose her as the one to use the silver arrow at the final battle. I did like that they did the widowed-father/daughter main characters, as you don't see that much in games or media in general.  Overall, it was a good game with an interesting story, but it may have been a bit too difficult and played out too long for a game that uses the same basic combat against the same basic enemies against the same basic backdrops.",

Thanks to the composer who worked on Journey, you are treated to aural goodness during battles and travelling.  The story is quite engaging with the player taking mulitple viewpoints of the situation from different characters. Without spoiling too much, you play as a leader of a caravan moving from various settlements attempting to escape an ancient foe. However, you will soon find out that life on the road can be quite harrowing and decisions must be made so that survival is ensured each day. That's another thing: the decisions made in this game aren't typical black/white/red/blue choices; they are considerably gray and deal more in how you choose to lead your flock.  Congratulations to Stoic for this great game (I've played through it twice now!) and I look forward to future installments.",

Those things aside, it is a beautiful game, colorful and gorgeous art style, has a very engaging, fast-paced story which really keeps you interested and wanting to find out what will happen next and addictive, strategic comat which is really the crowning jewel of the game. The combat is taken almost directly from the free to play, online, Banner Saga multiplayer, which is 100% combat oriented.  I had a lot of fun playing it but if you are looking for an RPG or looking to make pretty much any concrete choices in your game, I would not recommend it. Instead I would describe it as an interactive novel, with Grade-A writing and the ability to jump in and directly control the outcome of every conflict in the story. If this type sounds appealing to you in any way, then I guarentee you will enjoy it and consider it money well spent.",

I would describe it as a board game RPG as you gather your party, choose which ones are going to battle, level them up but you never get to change the armor or sword they use. This game shows the story of caravans running away from their lands due to invasion by external forces. You spend most of the game travelling or talking with the members of your caravan. Those talks can boost or decrease morale. Besides the morale of your caravan, controlling food is a crucial travel element. Whenever you get into battle, which is the second main element of this game, the game displays a board to you allowing you to position your party members and fight much like a turn based strategy. Each hero has health and armor. Health is the same as any other game. Higher armor helps those heroes receive minimal damage therefore it is crucial to decrease as soon as possibile the armor of your enemies in battle. Besides managing your caravan and fighting there is not much else to do, however the story is quite interesting and succeds in transporting you to this medieval mithological world. I enjoyed playing this game and even though this game is a complete experience (not based on episodes), it appears that this is only the beggining of the story (may be a trilogy??).

For much of it you are switching between two groups travelling through lands being overrun with giant monsters called Dredge and you can lead as the type to fight on the front lines or as a tactical advisor with many fights being avoidable. My initial impressions were it was a strong story with interesting travel choices and somewhat weak combat, but the more I played the more I realized there were quite a few layers of strategy to employ well beyond simply trying to beat down your opponents.  The story is stupendously engaging, and even knowing one possible outcome I had to go right back in and do it again - with less screw ups! Even though you are constantly strained, on the run, and it is overall rather dour, there are moments which remind you there can be glimmers of light in even the darkest of times. I felt for the characters who were largely a ragtag band doing all they could to survive as their world fell apart around them.  Even with its simpler game play, the art and audio fit great, and there's nothing like suddenly noticing the panorama is filled with skulking monsters bearing down on you. The soundtrack was a great addition to my playlist unlike anything I had before.  Overall, it's challenging (especially on hard) and I've never been so engaged by a game where I was constantly on the edge of losing and if you remotely enjoy random event games or turn-based strategy then TBS is a must.",

It's over head though, not 3D (no screen rotating, height variations, etc).  The character development and story progression is a lot like XCOM. Your characters have different classes, advance slowly (at first), they can be injured and have to rest after battle before they are usable again and naturally - strategy plays a huge part, in both development and battles.  Furthermore, you are constantly making meaningful decisions. Again, it's like XCOM. You'll get a request to help a small village under attack. If you deny it, some of your followers may get upset and leave. If you agree, you might gain some resources or even a new item or character. However this always comes at a cost. After a battle you'll be forced to camp out and rest, which uses up your valuable supplies.  If anyone is still reading, ill drop some simple Pros and Cons based on my first few hours with the game.  +Beautiful artwork and Soundtrack (Yup, just like everyone else is saying)  +Familiar, yet inventive battle system. Refreshing and surprising to someone like me, who has played dozens of SRPGs.  +The story keeps you involved. It's not just paragraph after paragraph. You're constantly making decisions and they tend to be rather blunt about most scenarios. There isn't a whole lot of filler but it still remains engaging.  +So far I've played with about 7-8 different classes. They seem pretty similar at first, but youll quickly learn their differences on the battlefield.  +Just flat out fun. Frankly, im pretty surprised to play a game like this on the PC. It seems more like a console game... and there's nothing wrong with that.  -ONLY AUTOSAVES, no manual! I kind of get why they did this, but it doesn't negate how glaringly absent it is. A prime example: I decided to raid a village that had been invaded. I fought a tough battle and won. Immediately after, I was given the option to finish off any other enemies and possibly gain some loot or to let them get away. Naturally, I chose the loot.... and died. Being the treasure hog that I am, I knew that I wanted to reload and try again. However I was given no such option. I ended the scene and had to rest a few days to let me heroes recover. I went to go and manually load -- but the autosave was for when I finished the battle, the only other option was to reload the chapter (which would have meant replaying about 45mins of gameplay).  -Pretty bland tutorial. It does the job, but trust me, youll find yourself saying 'wait, what just happened' fairly often. Just be prepared, it's kind of trial and error for a little while.  -The first 4 hours have been pretty confusing and a little overwhelming. You basically play the story from 2 different perspectives and have to switch back and forth between two armies. It works, but don't be surprised if you find yourself in some training battles just to get used to all the new characters they throw at you.   A final note, the preorder character was absolutely worth the preorder. He's my favorite character so far and hes actually pretty damn good in battle. I'd suggest picking him up if they release DLC down the road.",

They tell you your choice matters, but it actually doesn't for a lartge part. The only real affect your actions have are over a few optional characters and fictional numbers that don't really matter. Also, while the game is going to be multiple parts, it doesn't really TELL you that, so unless you research, you're left with a bad impression, asking yourself why there's all the loose ends that there are.   Overall: They've created a very big world with a lot of lore and I look forward to the future of the series, I just hope that the future games (which hopefully will have better funding) can deliver a bit more of a real choose your own adventure story. I don't mind if I always wind up in the same place through the story, but I'd like to actually genuinely have a different adventure then another person, something like letting me go through land or through the sea to a single place.

            "review_text": "I rarely write reviews, but this game deserves it. Still, I realize some people's expecations could be disappointed, so my aim is to set expectations straight:  - This game is for people who love beautiful artwork. With this I mean people who appreciate subtle, athomspheric artwork in a unique style. I found myself several times just looking for minutes at the caravan moving across the landscape. At the same time many people may find the presentation style boring, unthrilling and too much visual novel than game. There are no AAA graphics, cut-scenes and 3-D environments. The journey is rather unspectacular besides the hand-crafted scenery, some my find it boring.  - The game is for people who love an engaging story requiring you to take part. It is emotional and satisfying, but requires you to fill in some holes on your own.  At the same time the story is rocky at the beginning and some answers remain open in the end. If a deep story is not what you want from a game, than this game might fall short of your expectations, because it is one of the main deliverables.  - The game is for people who love being challenged with though choices. Outside of some Tealltale Games (The Walking Dead, the Wolf among us) no game was able to present me such difficult decisions. The decisions are tough, fair, logical and difficult to estimate the long-term outcome. Just like in real life.  At the same time it takes away control over the outcome of the game. People with flawless victories in battles may find themselves still crippled by decisions they make. Charakters they start to love may (and probably will) die. Some may consider this unfair and it is. Just like live.  - The game is for people who love their adventures being enhanced with elements of tactical turn-based combat and some RPG-elements. This brings nice diversity At the same time the game might disappoint people who seek this game out for these elements in the first place. Although the game delivers both mechanics acceptably, they are below par of their competitors like XCOM. The character advancement does not bring anything very substantial to the characters and the battles are fun, but become repetitive after having played a number of them.  I recommend this game to other players that are aware of what they can expect from it.  ",

The art style is wonderful, the lore of the world is a brilliant parallel to Nordic mythology, but sadly, for all the choices the game gives you, it's still very linear, which is very fine for the first playthrough, but outside of making your life easier on successive plays, or unlocking achievements, it doesn't really warrant extra playthroughs in my book.  Now, don't get me wrong, I absolutely love character based stories, and this game features several interesting and diverse characters, set in a seemingly rich world of vikings, varls, dredge, and ancient history. I say seemingly, because this first installment is too short to give you an actual view of the world as a whole, but rather, you get glimpses into the mythology of the world, and the local settlements. Of course, this is meant as a series, so I am sure much more of this world will be revealed in the subsequent games, so don't take that as too much of a criticism.   Graphics wise, the game is quite a thing of beauty, and the style is very deliberately 'raw'. The handdrawn landscapes are marvelous, and the game's artstyle was something I personally fell in love with. Even the animations are top notch quality, and there seems to be weight in the sprites as they get hit and move around.   Gameplay is kind of retro, but in the good way. Think Fire Emblem, Shining Force, etc, turn based, grid combat. It's well balanced, and in my playthrough, even the most hopeless battle was winnable, hard fought as though it may have been. There are some unique mechanics, such as how health, damage and armor is calculated, adjecency effects, as well as abilities that lets you manipulate the position of the enemy characters, and much more.   And the music/sound? I wish I could've gone into some greater detail with it, but it's been a long time since I played this, and I recall it being good.",

As someone who is a pretentious jerkoff I feel the art fits the game and setting wonderfully and really makes one feel a bit chilly (but maybe that's just the real life weather). Character design also generally varies, while remaining historical feeling with no fan service.  *The plot is well-done and plays into Celtic/Norse mythology without being a rip-off or generic with new Gods and new legends.

Most of the characters are also likable or at least interesting, leaving you to actually care about them and what happens to them.  *Battle mechanics are interesting, and as someone who doesn't usually like turn based fighting, I found them fun and challenging but not impossible. It's also got a lot of fun little creative points and I often was craving another challenging battle. Most special abilities are actually useful and no stat feels unimportant when leveling. It's also a (nice) difficulty sink, at least in my opinion, that you can 'break' a character by putting points in incorrectly (sorry, Gunnulf!).  *Random events are exhilirating without being exhausting for I found it was usually common sense which ones would lead to negative outcomes. Most don't feel forced in either; it seems like something you could easily run into. Losing characters over ♥♥♥♥♥♥ things you can't help is a nice touch of realism.  *The over-all mechanics generally blended well into a relatively fun game.  That said, there's probably more bad than good - which took what could of been a replayable new 'favorite' and made it a one-time playthrough. This is acceptable (and something I can still feel comfortable recommending, if only while on sale) because that one playthrough will probably give you 8-15 hours of game play and you may get a second if you're big into achievements and side paths but it still is a bit of a disapointment.  *It often felt like I was playing a choose-your-own-adventure book turned video game rather than an actual open-ended game that allowed me to make decisions and effect the outcome. While your decisions do make an impact and it's easy to effect things greatly there are still only two (very slightly different) endings and no one is bothered deeply if you mess up. If you ♥♥♥♥ off one person or someone dies no one else cares. If your morale is high or low no one mentions it. It all feels unconnected and gives you little reason to do the smaller things, because after that one decision is done and made - it's rarely brought up again.  If you let an important character die, it won't make it harder from a plot point. It just will make battles harder and maybe upset you if it was a favorite. There are a few exceptions, but usually these are majorly negative events which make you regret taking someone onto your team - rather than making anything easier or opening up a new path.   If you've played a Fallout game, you'll know what it's like to have 'real world'-esque consequences, where you'll help one person or hurt one and have it benefit or hinder you later on. There's very little of that in The Banner Saga despite it advertising itself as 'every decision effecting you'. You can tell there's little difference in the major plot regardless of what you do and with there being practically no 'side material' you don't even get that.  Some examples include taking on a monster baby, only to never have it effect you again; or stealing food from farmers and upsetting your daughter, but never having her mention it again. Will decisions sometimes matter? Yes, but not that much and not that often. The biggest benefit is when a child you rescue warns you about enemies later on, but that's really it.  *Side plots don't exist.   Or rather, they just don't matter. In fact, neither does the main plot. The Banner Saga is the first of a three-part series and if you don't plan on buying all three - and care at all for the plot - don't buy the first. The major plot points (such as the destruction of the planet and the sun not moving) are never resolved and subplots (such as who kills a king) aren't either.   The only plot you see through to the end is the safety of (one) of the caravans you escort; which, if you thought was a side plot and spent more time tending to your heroes probably isn't that safe anyway. You get your people to safety, but it's temporary at best and nothing else happens, leaving you at a cliff hanger and feeling a bit ripped off. It isn't an overly long game either, so it isn't like things were dragging on and needed a break.  The game feels like going to a movie that was sliced into parts to force people to buy more than one ticket, not like a stand alone title.  I feel if the above issue wasn't combined with the one before it, the two would sort of even one another out. If there were tons of side plots you finished up where your decisions really mattered it'd be fine for it to end with none of the bigger things resolved; or if the major plot was resolved, I don't think I'd care about my lack of control on the story.   Many decision games have replay ability because there's so many small options and so many quests to do in different ways, unlocking more dialog and so on. There isn't that here, limiting an already limited game.   *You're often faced with the difficult decision of whether you should level your characters, buy items, or feed your caravan - and as most items do relatively little for the price, it really becomes a two way decision.  Feeding your caravan makes a few end-game bits easier and mid-game fights less challenging if you're bad at fighting with your heroes, but leveling your characters (and just a few) is ultimately more important unless you want the end boss fight to be almost impossible. That said though, even then you have a gamble - because heroes sometimes come and go, even if you make the right decision - and leveling the wrong ones could leave you high and dry regardless.  With how hard the 'currency' is to come across, it's often frustrating rather than difficult. You'll finish the game either way so it isn't 'hard', it's just annoying.  *One of my biggest issues is a really stupid one, but people will begin starving the SECOND you run out of food by the dozens. I wish they offered an option to ration food at the cost of morale and that morale did more. It would of added some depth of options in a game that gives you very little to actually do.  *No save game makes it so you often are FORCED to play until a certain point and can't simply make a decision for fun and then go back and redo it. Undoing a single mistake can force you to replay two hours of the game, a feature that's annoying. I wish it could be turned on and off, perhaps at the cost of an achievement, rather than being a frustrating difficulty sink.  (Con in comments)",

The game interface packs some very poor design choices that I would not be afraid to call bugs: the navigation between the characters in the 'Heroes tent' section of the camp is defective, meaning you can only navigate to the previous or next component of the battle team, with no access to the other members of the roster other than exiting the 'slideshow' view and clicking directly on the character you are interested in; also, you have no way to check character's stats and equipment when you have to choose which one of them you want to take to battle. Many of this little flaws make the parts of the game other than battles and voyages feel very, very cheap. I felt like I was playing a flash browser based game a few times.  I also have complaints about the way turns are built in the battle gameplay, since the two factions take turns, not the characters, until one of the factions just has one man standing. I suppose this has something to do with the system they use to even out the teams in the multiplayer gameplay, but it should not be so in the campaign.   This bummed be expecially because the game is a masterpiece in everything else. The plot is deep, the background story is just as great as you would expect from something coming from scandinavian mythology, the game is just immersive and I loved everything I did not hate (which is minor stuff if you look at the big picture) :D",

The music with icelandic  vocals is very beautiful and the biggest asset of the game.  The story holds a few surprises and is well written although a bit clichéed.  The gameplay consists of turn based action sequences and dialog sequences where you  need to take decisions that affect the course of the game.   The turn based fights are faced paced due to only a small amount of tactical options.  The decisions in the dialogs are usually choose the lesser kind of evil type and have  unexpected side effects later on.    The bad ======  The turn order:  It's always you act with one unit, opponent acts with one unit.  This means that a lot of times if there is a big difference in units  units might get hurt or die without being able to act.   Strength == Health:  It's a self fueling circle. You have stronger units you will do more  damage and do better in combat. Your high strength unit takes  an unlucky hit, you might as well start again as this will draw you  down.   No comeback mechanic This essentially means if you are winning battles the game gets easier  as you go along. Your trek has higher morale which makes successive  battles easier, you get more XP which means higher level characters  and more food which again increases morale.  But loose battles things spiral down without you being able to do much  about it.   No save games You can copy your savegames around by hand. Why am I supposed to  do that. An ironman mode could just be added for the people that desire  this. If I commit 12h to a game like this I don't want to have to restart if  things spiral out of control.   Small amount of tooltips  It would have helped tremendously to see the turn order as an icon on the  characters on the battlefield and not as a list at the bottom that you always  have to click manually.   Game stops in the middle of the story While it does not end with a cliffhanger the story is not concluded and it  is nowhere indicated that this game is of episodic nature.   No move undo You click once to move and that's it. No successive movement if you still  have movement points and no change to undo if you misclicked.   The conclusion ===========  If you can live with the bad things above, the game is actually quite fun  to play and interesting.",

            "review_text": "Banner Saga has elements of 'Oregon Trail' in that you are managing a caravan, elements of 'Final Fantasy Tactics' in that you have tactical combat on a regular basis with upgradeable and equippable characters, and 'Choose Your Own Adventure' books in that you have many decisions to make throughout the game that impact the trajectory of the story.   GAMEPLAY: 8/10 The tactical combat is both sufficiently varied and accessible. You have to learn a few things to understand how it works (and I know there are probably some fine points I don't understand yet). The question mark icons give you some tutorial information, but it isn't complete. The learning curve is probably the weakest point of the game, but it wasn't game-breaking. The different character types add variety and there is a basic inventory management system and currency with which you purchase supplies, equipment, and most importantly use to upgrade your characters. The fact that it is entirely possible to gimp yourself by focusing on the former and overlooking the latter is a weak spot, but I managed to figure this out early and I think you will too. Overall I thought the gameplay was solid and engaging.   GRAPHICS: 10/10 For the setting and style of game, I thought the graphics were superb. The hand-drawn visuals on everything from the overworld map to the characters and backgrounds were a great touch. There was a definite look of quality all the way through. I'm a big believer that graphics quality is not solely based on realism, but has to make sense and mesh well with the context of the game - and help set the tone. Banner Saga's visuals do this very well.   SOUND: 8/10 First off, the music is very good. It evokes the feeling of the nordic-inspired lands through which you journey. My gripe was that there were significant gaps in the music, I would have liked more, even if it didn't necessarily play all the time. Sounds in combat were decent, though I though some of the character 'I've been hit' sounds were off, especially for Allette.   STORY: 9/10 The story was compelling and there was quite a bit of it. If you don't like reading, don't buy this game. Most of it is done in dialogue and prose through the various decisions you make throughout the game. There are heroes, villains, and some you can't be quite sure. You experience joy, loss, fear, relief, fear, and wonder. The story is wound with threads of loyalty and betrayal. Characters are memorable and develop over time. The game does a good job of 'making you care' - a trait many games fail to evoke. This makes the decisions laid before you more critical, and the results more meaningful. The decisions are almost always difficult to make, you are often choosing between the good of the group and the good of the individual, to be compassionate or pragmatic, whether to take the risk now for the payoff later, or to play it safe. The sound, graphics, and gameplay were good, but the story is what kept me 'in the game' for the entire 9 hour playthrough. I wanted to know what came next.  Overall Banner Saga was an excellent game, I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading fantasy, tactical turn based combat, or caravan management.",

I felt like I was engaged in a movie (in a good way) as well as playing a game. I only crashed once while playing this game, so I'd say it's stable.  If you are looking for an action packed game, then this is NOT for you. I would say this is a casual, relaxing game at best. All you need is a mouse to point and click. TBS is as linear as a game can be.  There is a very detailed map in the game that feels wasted. Every nook and cranny has detailed lore about it, but you're not going to explore over half of it, which is a shame.  There are 3 races in the game. Humans, Varl and Dredge. I feel like they could have done more with the Dredge. There are about 4 or 5 different looking dedge sculpts, then each of those has a couple colour variations of the same sculpt. So after a few battles with them, it can get a bit tedious fighting the same enemies over and over again.  The reknown system is both your XP and currency. You gain it from killing enemies, or through the decisions you make throughout your travels. It can get very frustrating when you have to make a choice of starving your army or promoting or buying items. I really wish they would have put gold or silver in the game to buy items and supplies. You get 1 reknown for killing an enemy, no matter how big or how small. It would be nice to be rewarded a bit more for killing larger enemies. Also, your characters only get a reknown towards their promotion if they get the killing blow on an enemy. I'm still trying to figure out if I like this or not, because it definitely adds strategy to the game, if you are trying to level up a certain character. The downside is you could have a character make some really critical strikes that help your teamates, but if they don't get that last shot to kill the enemy they will stay a low rank and die easily as you progress.  Combat is simplistic. Hit their strength or armor. There are no tactics such as flanking or backstabbing, which really makes the battles feel tedious as you progess through. I think they can do a lot more with this system to spice it up rather than just rushing forward and hoping you kill them before they kill you.  On to the caravan sequences. As you travel town to town you will get dialog options that will help, harm, or do nothing based on your dialog choices. You will lose caravan followers, supplies, and even playable characters (used in battles). A lot of people feel like this is just a pointless guessing game, as some logical choices harm you and some bad choices help you, but not always.... so in a way they are right, it is a guessing game, but there were a lot of times when I was really surpised by the outcome, good or bad, it gave the game some depth for me and really brought me into some dark times (people starving, poor morale, people unhappy with my choices and leaving), but Iwas fine with that. It really playied into the dark depressing atmosphere of the game, and because my main characters were not natural leaders, the guessing part really made sense to me. It made me appreciate those choices that worked out in my favor that much more!  All in all, I recommend this game! I really enjoyed it and felt like I got my moneys worth. It was a breath of fresh air from the games I usually play. Yes, there are some things they can improve on and I'm sure they will if they make another installment.   I give it a 7.5/10   ",

I feel like gameplay is the best place to start in describing a game, so consider the combat. Turn-based and simple seeming at first glance (with each unit having one active, skill which automatically levels up, and one passive skill, which doesn't), the 'health is damage' element makes every hit hurt. You hear the sound and see the little animated guy stagger and think, 'we're all gonna die,' and you're sometimes right, and then Egil dies. I can only name one game to have had this feature in the past, an old Gameboy Color title named Legend of the River King...   So anyways, grim terror all around, right? You're in charge of two different massive groups of people from opposite ends of the world whose storylines intertwine as they flee an endless invading army of tree-sized replicas of Disney's Iron Giant (tm) - which are similar to humans except for having really thick armor, which you usually have to hurl your puny humans and awesome giants (did I mention you control massive horned nordic giants created when a god crossed humans with some kind of magic Ox?) against repeatedly before damaging their health, and then Egil dies.  The music is nice, and they put a little bit of voice acting into some random scenes narration as your little grimdark 80s Disney army slowly walks across doomed countrysides, constantly interjected by storyline pop-ups wherein mostly bad things happen, or you get something good but it causes a tragedy later, or Egil dies, or all of the above. I would describe the game's feel overall as Last Unicorn meets Gears of War/Dark Souls, except maybe don't praise the Sun here, because did I mention the Sun just stopped in the sky for no reason? Hail to the Great Serpent.   Spoiler Tips: Try not to starve to death, fight whenever possible to afford rations, don't level up or put gear on the people who are going to be randomly killed off (and their gear vanishes when they do so), rest maybe, and don't level like any of the varl but Hakon and Gunnulf (Gunnulf can also die unless you shout at him a lot). Don't level Egil, he's going to die. I know, he's useful, but he's also not going to make it. Not your first time through. It's like surviving your first run in Sunless Sea, just get over it.  10/10",

The story is compelling to say the least. I'm not one to upsell and I don't want to spoil much of it, however you can see the story playout from multiple perspectives and meet up 3/4ths through. The most compelling aspect of The Banner Saga, and the probably the reason I enjoyed it so much was it's ability to tell it's story so smoothly. You grow fond of characters, dislike others, silently mourn the loss of a follower or bless whatever gods these fictional warriors believe in for ridding certain individuals.

Mostly through dialogues, but there is a huge amount of detail hidden in the map. All in all the world building is top-notch and the presentation doesn't rely on exposition. But the point that really sets this game apart, is the way it handles decisions. No red/blue points to hint what is what, no easy predictions what the right decision is, not even certainty, what each decision will actually result in. You decide and you have to live with the results.  I consider storytelling to be what makes or breaks RPGs. I can sit through mediocre combat, if the story is good enough, but not the other way round. Fortunately, The Banner Saga also has very solid mechanics. The principle is both easy to get and still gives you options during the fights.  You get to level your characters, although the paths you can take a given one are a bit limited. However, leveling consumes the same resources that is required for items and provisions. The last even ties your resource management into the story, since you're not going to starve your fellow refugees to buy shiny weapons. Or are you?  All in all, I can fully recommend this game. The only thing that's missing is a hole in the earth that swallows  King.com. ",

Having recently played a stint of next gen games, I was initially put off by the 2D animation, lack of fully animated dialogue, etc.; but they were quickly dispelled after about 10 minutes in. The game reminds me of the old 'choose your own adventure' books I loved as a child, and the rich, evocative text made it feel like I was reading a beautifully illuminated novel, rather than playing a video game. The music is a suberb composition that couples perfectly with the sweeping vistas of hand-painted landscapes you traverse. The art style is clean, and distinctive. The characters have depth, and give you reasons to be attached to them. This also makes it hard when they die; decisions you make affect the narrative of the story, and some characters may not survive those decisions. Combat system is fun, and engrossing; I had more than a few nail-biters.   All in all I give The Banner Saga a 9.5/10. The 0.5 off is because of the ending. Believe me, it was a great ending, except it isn't really an ending. More like, the end of Book 1. A lot of questions are left unanswered, and major plotlines have yet to be resolved.

I Wish I could say more about the story, but I think it really is best told with a fresh head. On to pros and cons Pros: -Amazing world. Lotr level worldbuilding here, so much is unexplored but nothing is left without thought. Great expanses and details make it a wonder to behold -Good design on characters  -Nice combat system and diversity of playstyle Cons: -Kinda punishing at times, can be very disheartning to play through a low moral/starving area.  -Story goes really fast. Keep a log or a good memory because there isn't much exposistion on stuff.  -A lack of UI optimization. Noteably the lack of being able to access previous conversation statements or the map when you are talking to someone. Can be really annoying to go over a speech and be locked in a uninformed decision -Kinda short at around 10 hours of gameplay. I won't go into detail, but while the ending is nice, it feels like they could have gone a lot farther before deciding to end the game. -  CLIFFHANGER ENDING   Check this game out. For twenty dollars, its worth it. ",

            "review_text": "So I initially came here to write a negative review. This game does a ton of things right, but a few seem very wrong. The single resource system being chief among them. The characters that disappear are most of the time understandable in that everything in this game is dying. You use them, you really use them. You hate it because you invested in them, you used your most valuable resource to bring them up, to equip them with that special item and then in a moment of desperation they are gone - and your people are starving because you put your resources into what is now ash. You vow not to do it again. You put your resources only into supplies so that at least you can keep what you have. And still you are tested - bandits take, fires claim, the cold wears you down causing more days spent resting, more days spent eating through those precious resources. You push on, pushing your motley crew of survivors through the bad times. They step up and augment your morale with stories, songs, little blossoms of beauty in a bleak world. When you finally get to the end and Yngvar remarks that you would think the gods might cut you some slack at some point, you realize that is what this has been all about. Why there is only one resource - your good name - and why everything is based upon it. You realize that this system is as much a part off the story as any off the characters and that in such a time of death and destruction, its all the characters or you have left. This little piece of immersion is just the icing on the cake of the wonderful stoy, the breathtaking visuals, and the moving audio. This game is definitely not for everyone and I do think that it could use a bit of fine tweaking, but all in all this game does present the bleak situation well and in the end feeling like iff nothing else you survived with your name, your renown intact.",

I recomment The Banner Saga because I understand that there are people out there who will love it and it was at least fun enough for me to sink 5 hours into it on my very first play.  Biggest problem is that if you make a mistake and need to start the game over, you have to go through ALL of that walking again. Since you can lose some of your favorite characters without any warning due to you choosing the wrong option in a pop up, that is a huge flaw in my book.  The Banner Saga shouldn't be marketed as an RPG or strategy game... it's a visual novel with RPG and strategy elements. If you don't like visual novels, you will hate it.",

I really hated it when they actually killed some of heroes and there was nothing you could do about it.  The gameplay is very similiar to Fire Emblem, and as there, if you do not know on which characters to lay a focus on, you'll end up being too weak to deal a sufficient amount of damage towards your enemies.  A big downside for me was, that the battles are basically always the same. You get dropped in a square area with a handful of enemies, which you have to beat until only you are left - that's it. Only strategy you got to know is, how to deal with any enemy (like armoured guys, archers, etc)  All in all tho, the game was very atmospheric and definitly worth your time if you enjoy strategy games..",

Second major gripe is the attack animations are sometimes oriented in the completely wrong direction from the enemy they are attacking, it seems like there was only budget for a few attack angles with the locked 2.5 D camera angle. Can be distracting at times.   I also beat the boss on normal with mostly level 2 and 3 archers, I didn't find a lot of oppurtunity for grinding at least on normal.",

That said, this adds a compelling immersion and gravity to the gameplay, which you really don't find in a lot of RPGs. (If minmaxing is your idea of 'role-playing,' you won't like this game.) Another interesting feature is that no matter what you choose, the game constantly progresses forward -- there is no way to 'lose' the game, there are just different consequences.   This is not a beginner's game (unless the beginner has thick skin) -- the difficulty curve is steep, and the game doesn't give you a lot in the way of tutorials or handholding.

            "review_text": "Banner Saga  3 / 5  A fun turn based strategy combat game with elements of RPG and resource management that may have spread itself too thin. Once through the first play through though, you're mileage may vary.  The Banner Saga is a turn based strategy combat game that tells the story of a Viking-esque world during a time of climactic change. You play as two different groups leading a caravan of soldiers and townsfolk escaping from an ancient foe and trying to find safety. It is here where the resource management comes in as you need to buy supplies for the journey which slowly deplete depending on caravan size. You also have to watch out for morale as spending too many days on the road reduces morale and causes you to slowly lose both warriors and townsfolk. In general, this gameplay device is simple and requires little micromanagement, but does affect gameplay during big battles, which leads me to...  Combat. As mentioned, combat is centered around a turn based strategy system with each character fitting into a 'class' with special abilities and methods of attacks. Spearman can attack on the diagonal, archers from afar, etc. Additional gameplay mechanic are introduced (for example, Giants take up more physical space and thus create lanes where smaller humans can attack / retreat, but the giants cannot) as the game progresses, but in general merely add nuance to the basics of this concept. The combat strategy is increased by introducing a health / damage &amp; armor components. Basically, health and damage are the same number, so the more damage you take, the less damage you do. Additionally, armor mitigates damage and if your enemy has more armor than you have damage the chances of you missing altogether goes up tremendously. This effectively creates interesting gameplay choices where a balance between attacks and movements have fairly large impact in the course of battle. This combat is the core of the game and gladly is the most well rounded and satisfying of the game components.  As for 'big battles'...at various points in the game you are approached by large 'armies' of enemies. Your ability at resource management determines how 'even' the battles are (if you are good, you've built up large numbers of warriors, if not not) and thus permit different forms of battle strategy. Are you pretty even in terms of strength with the enemy showing signs of fear. Make a heroic charge. Determined enemy and slightly outnumbered? Fight defensively. Overwhelming odds...try to flee. You take control of your characters and engage in the same micro level battles you always engage in, but your success (or failure) determines how many losses you take during the course of battle. In the end, its an interesting way of tying the resource management to combat, but really loses impact at lower difficulty settings and in general feels much like the resource management part of gameplay…something interesting and tied together with other elements well , but not a fully fleshed out mechanic .  The RPG elements come in a couple flavors. First is the character development via combat improvement. Getting kills eventually raises levels for each character which raises ability levels and releases skill points that can be used to increase armor break, health/damage, armor, willpower, etc. Each character has maxes set to each attribute based on their 'class' so there are some inherent limitations which provide justification for specialization. One problem with this approach though is while level one characters are still effective in battle at later stages of the game, they do suffer from being under-powered on even the lower difficulties. Thus, it’s easy to fall into the old RPG problem of a core set of characters you're almost forced to use and a group you almost can't.  The other RPG element comes via story line. You can converse with characters and learn their stories / engage in some 'Tell Tale Lite' conversation dialogues that impact the course of events. An interesting addition to the game, but it’s not given enough detail to make the effort seem worthwhile, especially considering the individual stories of the characters aren't overly memorable and these interactions typically just means you lose a character from death / running away. In games which utilize this gameplay component in a more robust fashion, this creates meaningful impact to player choice and a sense of real loss when liked (and powerful) characters are lost. Here, the losses seem almost arbitrary and really only have impact if you just so happened to dump a lot of resources into leveling that particular character.  Storyline is mainly told through written dialogue which you read at the bottom of the screen. In general that works, but every so often a character actually speaks their lines, which is surprisingly jarring. I don't remember the specific instances having any special dramatic effect so if you do it occasionally, why not do it for the entire game? The graphics are similar in that regard in that they are perfectly acceptable to the storyline and world created. The predominance of the game is a 2D picture format with some comic book styled depth accents and I might even go so far as to say they created an art style fairly appropriate to the world. However, combat sequences take on a 'Saturday Morning Cartoon' look that isn't unappealing, but does kind of clash with the 'grim' nature of the story (end of world) and somehow loses some of the appeal found during the rest of the game.   In any case, I've run through quite a few shortcoming of this game, but I want to stress it really is fun for the 5-10 hours it'll take you to beat it. The question is will you want to go back and play this game again and again? I think the gameplay mechanics and difficulty control (going harder really does make the game more challenging) means there will be a subset of people who will enjoy this game many times over...I'm just only going to do so once.",

            "review_text": "It's not often I'm getting surprised by the quality of a game, but this exactly what happened to me with The Banner Saga. The reason for this being that this game is a one of a kind. Surely, the genre of RPG with tactical battles is nothing new, but the developers managed to create an interesting and innovative battle system that gives you quite a lot of possibilities to show off your prowess as a tactician. But what really makes The Banner Saga a unique experience is its caravan management gameplay that makes you pay heed to every decision you make throughout the game, keep the supplies sufficient and prevent the caravan morale from dropping low. I must also mention that the difference between the difficulty levels is evident. Given all my previous experience with TRPG I still struggled with some battles on Hard, and the final battle on Hard is really hard, but still possible to win after several tries. Another aspect of this game that is very important for me personally is the music. I think I haven't listened to such a beautiful and fitting music in quite a long time. One nice bonus is the participation of Malukah in creation of the soundtrack. Her voice adds another dimension to the melodies. I guess, the only aspect of The Banner Saga I didn't feel completely content with is the character development. Hopefully the developers pay more attention to that in the next game of the series. My conclusion is that this game is definitely worth to be in a collection of any player that likes tactical RPG, drawn art and Norse mythology.",

It would be that it only took me around 16 hours to finish it, and that was because I restarted after some hours. I was drawn into the story pretty much right from the get go and enjoyed every bit of it. Even when I had a few of things go wrong and bad things happened to people. I really loved the story behind this game, and on top of that there was a pretty nice turnbase battle game in there too!   Spoiler Alert below:   This game tugged on the heart string pretty good too as I watched my family die by the end of the game due to things I did or said.   That's about as much as I'll say about that. Find out more if you haven't picked this game on yet to see the full story.  If I gave ratings, this would be a 8 out of 10 only because I wished it didn't end and had more to give!  Can't wait to pick up the story in part 2 as I bought it also.  I hope it's a little longer, but if not, that's okay.  Like a good book you wish you could un-read, just to read it again., The Banner Saga plays like that!  I wish I could forget all that happened in this game, just so I could play it again.",

This is fairly standard turn based tactical combat, with a few interesting twists but in the end, very little variety. I'm still not sold on the Armour/Power system. Nor do I like that your health is the same as your stregth. It causes big problems in character balance, with characters ending up tanky and strong, or weak and crippled. You have a 'mage' like character with just two spells, neither of which is powerful, and his attack is a tickle at best. Less glass cannon and more glass peashooter.  Abilities in general feel like they have little impact. I'd pull of some interesting moves (mark target with two archers in range) only to do 1 or 2 damage because of the armor/health is strength system. It just doesn't balance correctly in my opinion  The main gripe I have, which may seem small to some, is turn order. It is ALWAYS your turn, their turn, your turn, their turn. At least until there is one enemy left. If you have 5 people left on the feild, and the enemy has 2, they still get the same number of moves as you. Since your characters never really feel all that powerful, it feels like an unfair disadvantage.  I recommend the game for it's story. The decisions you make have genuine impact, and are extremely tough to call in some instances. The atmostphere is quite harrowing after a point.  If you are looking for a deep tactical SRPG, I'd look elsewhere",

To an extent this is true, however I had this game on my radar months before it was released, I already knew that a trilogy is in the works, and in fact a trailer for the second has been released. I also knew that the combat was not going to be anything groundbreaking. With that in mind I was able to enjoy this game. The ending was sudden, but I knew that more was on the way so I was upset by how it ended, not when it ended. This is a story driven game with some combat thrown in.

I'm a big fantasy buff, and there are some very strong influences visible in Banner (namely LOTR). Just look at the world map and you'll see what I mean. But I mean... LOOK at that world map! There's so much detail, so much unique history creating a world backdrop that I wanted to move into and never leave. With such a fully realized world, Banner never feels like a copycat or knockoff of other fantasy properties. It felt like getting to discover something with the depth of Middle Earth again for the second time.   And the music just ratchets up the whole experience. Amazing orchestral and vocal arrangements really elevate the experience to another level. A feast for the ears as much as the eyes. Speaking of the art did not disappoint. The beautiful hand-drawn art perfectly captures the world and characters in Banner. A perfect blend of world, visuals and audio will suck you in and make you forget the hours passing in the real world.   There's also a ton of non-combat gameplay that I wasn't expecting. The story events and decision making feels as rewarding as any other game I've played (Mass Effect series etc.) The repurcussions of your decisions feel like they have real weight, with sometimes immediate (and sometimes delayed) effects. The actual combat gameplay (maybe the second reason I bought the game, besides the art) is spot on. It's easy to pick up, but I feel like I was really only mastering by the end of the campaign (which is fairly short.) I had some great moments, like getting down to just one of my main characters while the enemy had 2 left and still squeaking out a win. Experimenting with the different classes of fighters and special moves brought a lot of depth. So much so, I started a second play through right away just so I could keep playing. That says something on it's own, as I RARELY ever play a game twice. As a gamer-dad, time is too precious!  Love this game. Cannot say enough good things about it.

Dialogue window keeps moving left to right from one character to another, for me it was annoying. This game is like a simple version of HOMM, some times too simple with too many main heroes you can choose to fight with. At the end I had to choose some and level them up, leavin the rest behind on 1 level. What concerns improvement system for your heroes it was simple and fast going. about an hour in the game I had most of them on 4 level or higher. I hoped for more complicated evolution for them, and more slow with some visual changes on the battlefield, which did not happen. But at all this a fine game with nice graphics and a story. Very short story. It took couple of hours to make it to the end.  So if you have 12$ and free time then enjoy. Hope some changes will be made in the second part.",

At times the combat can get a little frustrating when one small mistake can cause a total party wipe, but there is almost no randomness to damage or saves, so you never feel like the computer is screwing you over. Battles get a bit repetitive in the middle of the game, but the story is enough to keep you interested.  Where this game really shines though is in the story and lore of the world. Getting invested in each of the characters and having to make difficult choices is gutwrenching every time. Be sure to explore the map and participate in every possible dialogue to get the full experience.   tl;dr Banner Saga is a great game that can be played in around 10 hours, contains lots of strategic thinking, emotional dialogue and decisions, and interesting characters.",

Some 'good' choices that you might've made might be bad choices later on, or vice versa. It's really hard to tell. So pay close attention to dialouge and situations that will leave characters either dead, your caravan short-handed on a few fighters and varls, or the worse part supplies.  The combat in this game takes notes from other combat sequences with this style. But makes it more 'simpler' and easy for the player to understand. Just keep an eye on your morale and survey the battlefield before charging head on. You can 'upgrade' the characters stats and do 'trainning' scenarios to further your understanding of possible combat scenarios. However, what could've been useful is for the game to allow us to make this trainning combat scenarios ourselves rather than being pre-selected. What's more is that, nothing reallly comes out of trainning.   Lastly. And this might be a personal gripe. Or it could be something players had asked before. But there is no 'save' feature in the options screen. The only way you can save is by making camp. While it might serve a purpose, or it's on players shoulders for paying close attention. Whatever the case maybe. It would be nice to have the actually ability to re-role some of our choices through manual saves.  And seeing how there is a sequel already and (to my belief) no further plans for updating the game. Hopefully, when or if a Banner Saga 3 comes along. I hope Stoic considers a 'manual save' feature.  Other than that, The Banner Saga itself is a must have for anyone who likes artistic and visual effort. And a bit of simplistic but overall gripping edge with a game.",

However: The combat system is shallow and unsatifying. There are two mechanics, Armor/Health and willpower. All tactical choices relate to attacking a units armor to inflict greater damage in progressive turns and spending willpower to move further or to apply bonuses to attacks. I'm not saying that ever every game needs to be FF:T or Disgaea, but that's literally all it is. Some characters have uniquie abilitiers, but there's no in game narrative connecting those abilities to the characters and they're mostly limited to a little more damage or a bit of knock back. It's just a boring slog.",

Combat is turn-based in isometric view and one of the few cases where you can control more than 4 people on a battlefield. Very challenging and sometimes seemingly unfair. The story is interesting and very well told but might get confusing if you don't pay good attention. Conversations have quite some impact, while the overall story stays the same, there are a lot of important decisions to make. The supply mechanic while traveling gives a good sense of tension (you buy supplies from the same currency you use to upgrade your soldiers), as do the scripted encounters on the way.

            "review_text": "A good advice, play it once and you'll be good.  Maann this game is cruel!!  One thing that pisses me off is that you have almost no control of your caravan which is a shame, because the map is huge and there are so many stories and descriptions about other places but that is even considerable. What is really bad is that you can choose a very few times between 2 places to go, camp, or stop or not at some key places. AND THAT'S IT. If you just left a city and forgot to buy your supplies, too bad, theres NO WAY to turn back to a place you literally 1 second ago just left... you'll have to endure loosing morale and soldiers as they starve until you find some other place, a randonly event that gives you supplies if you choose the right(misleading) dialog option, or you can reload to the last save(some times of 30 minutes ago), that by the way you have no control either. Worst of all is that sometimes you're in the middle of something and all the sudden your caravan leaves town without even ask you if want to do anything at all before leaving(and that's because you're the commander), like buying the damm supplies which you've been saving to buy before leaving, making you f**king furious that was no warning, and you now have to play again from the last save because you magically didn't guessed that you would leave before a very specific dialog.  It's like most of the game you have to choose between get or not a ball on the floor where you're passing by, but the consequences of such choice is that 30 days latter you discover that that ball somehow had a poison and it's killing your entire family and friends one by one, and there's no antidote for the poison. To complete your son goes get the ball one day that it rolled by the wind to the street, he gets hit by a truck and dies. And none of that BS wouldn't happen if in the early game you didn't had f**king stop to grab the damm ball, that just would add to your life a little joy, nothing essential.  Don't get me wrong I loved this game, the story is very involving, deep plot, and took me some time to get all the lore of the game. Though after finishing it a second time I felt pretty frustrated by the fact that most of the choices change anything at all on the story and by catastrophic events that you almost cant avoid. Like a treason from a certain character that clearly, and out loud, tells you the reason that he betrays you, so in your next playthrough you do everything possible so he wont have any reason to do so, and in the end no matter what choices you made neither your way of doing things, the treason end up happening by the same points that you avoided this whole time along with some other nasty s*it at the same event punishing you harshly at the middle-end game by a ridiculous single choice you made in the very begining that has NO WAY of being unmade neither avoided from triggering the trason, making events like these look plastic and taking you all the will to replay the whole game.  As you play the second time or more you realize that most of the choices wont change a bit on the game, and the ones that change your path has very little impact(being very generous with the 'little' here) on the plot and story, so don't waste your precious time to play it again.",

At the very beginning we are informed that at our decisions affect the game: THEY DON'T. Despite the fact that they've created this vast and gorgeous world, steeped in lore and history, you can't even choose where to go. You're firmly 'on-the-rails' for the entire game. Occasionally, you get text based encounters where you get to make a decision, but having played Banner Saga a couple of times, I can tell you that most of these change nothing. Sometimes one character or another dies, but it's trivial since they aren't really necessary anyway.  At the very beginning we are treated to a beautiful animated cut-scene complete with voice acted dialogue, so you'd figure those would come up at key points in the game at least, right? THEY DON'T. Not even at the end.  As the story develops, more and more layers are revealed: The gods are dead; the sun has stopped in the sky; there's a prophecy; there's tension and intrigue between characters and races, etc, etc. NONE OF IT GOES ANYWHERE. In a nut shell, the story is: survive until you get to the end boss - who has practically nothing to do with anything.  The artwork is gorgeous, the concept (Viking Oregon Trail + Turn Based Strategy + Some RPG elements) is simple but it works. But instead of using that simplicity to really open up the world, we're instead treated to a vast tableaux of untapped potential.   Maybe they're planning a sequel - and heck, I've put this many hours in already, I might even pick it up - but honestly, if a game leaves you feeling, 'What, that's it?' It failed to deliver.   EDIT: I DO NOT care that Banner Saga is part of a planned trilogy. I WILL NOT base a review of a game on the potential of its sequel.

            "review_text": "I love the Viking setting. I enjoy the story, and it certainly kept my attention. The combat has some interesting mechanics: armor break, the fact that strength is health, and some great special moves.  However, the turns and initiative are implemented in a really frustrating way that, in the end, has ruined this game for me.  First, each side gets to move one unit per turn, no matter how many units are remaining, in a fixed rotation. As enemy units are injured and lose health, they also lose the ability to deal damage. However, once they are killed, their spot in the initiative order is filled by another healthy unit. If I have 4 units remaining, but the enemy has only 2 units, then those units will each act twice as frequently as my 4 units, and they will have a distinct advantage. Sometimes I may have a couple of units across the map who have just killed their opponents, and while those two waste turns walking back to the other side, the fewer remaining enemy units that are engaged with the other half of my force will be attacking twice as often as those units near them.  Bottom line is that killing an enemy unit is generally a bad idea until the very end of the fight.  I have adjusted to this tactic, as unintuitive and frustrating as it sometimes is. Now that I have advanced sufficiently, I was able to raise the Strength of one of my favorite units to 18. Now, his key ability, the sweeping attack that hits 3 enemies, has been rendered much weaker. Many weak enemy units can be killed by a single 18 STR attack. When he had only 16 STR, he could severely injure 3 of these weak units in one blow, which was fantastic. Now, he kills them outright, and what remains are 3 stronger units that now get to attack twice as frequently.  Killing an enemy unit is a bad idea? Killing 3 of them even worse? My favorite character is too strong, and that's a tactical disadvantage?  To me, this is just a bridge too far.  Is it novel? Yes. Can you work around it? Sure. But it draws out the combat as you avoid weakened enemies and chase down the healthy ones before you start delivering the killing blow. And the longer I play this game, the less I enjoy it.",

The art and music are very well done and bring a sure charm to the game that seems to have bedazzled a lot of reviewers. My issues with the game didn't become aparent until well into it (more than a few hours). The only important resource in the game is 'renown', which you use to either level up your characters or to buy supplies so your 'caravan' can eat. There is so little renown in the game you generally have to choose to do either/or of these activities. As a result you can either feed your people as a kind leader would and end up losing a lot of battles with a stagnant squad of low level guys or you can ignore your people, allow them to starve and die off, and level your squad of fighters to win battles. Despite the fact that one of your two leaders you control has the occupation of 'master hunter' there is no hunting in the game. No way to procure food except for the occassional scripted even with a 'King of Dragon Pass' choose your own adventure chance to get precious supplies.   It makes for a frustrating experience. Perhaps the point is the force the player into being cold and heartless much the same way Fable 3 did. That experience ended up being sub optimal as well.   For $30+ I wish there was more of a game here to go with the fantasy story. It just as easily could have been an excellent interactive novel on an iPad. Instead of playing to the strengths, the game is shackled like a mewing beast to lame 'Oregon Trail' gameplay and a somewhat counter intuitive basic turn based tactical combat system. There are D&amp;D Goldbox games available online that were made twenty years ago with far more tactical depth than what this 2014 game offers.   On the upside, the game looks great (even on a Mac without a dedicated graphics card). The music is decent if not a bit overly dramatic. The characters are mostly interesting.

It actually provides you with a map you can click on, so you can learn about the different regions and cities of the world, but then won't let you plot a course to visit any of them. - The combat is actually pretty boring once you realize that every round of turn based combat, the turns go back and forth between you and the enemy. You just killed 3 enemies so it's now 5 on 3? Well, that just means some of the enemy units will go twice. It really sucks any aspect of strategy right out of the game. - The ENDING! Wow.

The things that bother me to no end are that the enemy gets as many turns as you do until hes down to his last guy, so if you have a large party, then the same 2 guys get to attack over and over again and will generally target the same character while your trying to move your other characters into position.  Ive watched 2 enemies hack through 5-6 of my toughest and full health/armor characters like butter and i have no ability to stop this. The enemies also all have higher level abilities then you and can really surprise you when they do tons of damage from a guy you have reduced down to almost nothing when your people become completely worthless and have to run away.  basically i just cant help but always feeling like the computer ai cheats and wont let you walk away without a black eye. The starting grids are also painful and you generally have to setup in a very specific way that is more of a headache to figure out then it should be and restricts you from options you would normally persue.  Also you generally have very little information to make descisions and either have to make it blind or look up solutions which kinds of spoils things.  Overall i really wanted to like this game, but it bothers me greatly and i can only play it in short spurts. If it goes on sale for $5 or less id pick it up, but no more.",

            "review_text": "TL;DR at the bottom.  When I had first heard about this game, I was super excited. Turn based combat with a beautiful art style and vikings? YES PLEASE. So I picked it up during the steam summer sale and I played it. I was promptly disappointed.  As I said before, the game has a beautiful art style, and a pretty interesting story. You lead a caravan of people running away from an 'evil' army. You have to manage supplies and make a wide range of decisions that result in multiple outcomes. An example: Refugees approach your caravan, what do you do? A) kill them B) Take them in C) Send them away. Take them in? They could take supplies and run or reveal a hidden cache of supplies to help you. Being able to spend the game making choices throughout the 'journey' is what would have made the banner saga a fantastic game. It has some measure of replayability trying out different options/choices and as I said, the story is actually interesting and had me intrigued enough to not put the game down.  So why don't I recommend this game?   Well the crux of the game is the turn based combat. The combat is similar to a lot of other turn based games but it has been simplified. The combat gets really boring after a few battles. The battles never really vary, there all pretty much the same thing. No difference in environment, no real tactical decisions during combat. Its dry, repetitive combat. The units don't do anything to improve this.  The units you get throughout the game have different abilities, which is cool, but they each only get one (ie a wide swing that hits 3 units, or a shield bash that knocks units back) dull ability. The units themselves can only level up to level 5. Which is a pretty low cap for leveling units. Leveling them does make them stronger, and make their respective abilities better but its almost a chore. I LOVE building strong characters, I spent many hours playing fire emblem, final fantasy tactics and other similar games building strong characters with interesting abilities. In this game the abilities are bland and leveling your characters isn't interesting or fun. Sure it's necessary for progression, but its a chore.  So we have a low level cap, boring units, boring abilities and boring combat. What else? The LENGTH of this game is INCREDIBLY short. I have 7 hours played, and I've beaten the game. From what I understand, this game is a part of a trilogy, and the second part will be released after a short break from the development team. So that begs the question, why is this game 24.99 for a few meagre hours of gameplay. Its entirely possible the second saga of this trilogy will take your characters from before, raise their caps and continue with the admittedly interesting story, but that doesn't change the fact that the first game in the series is dull and it relies on a second game to make itself worth anything.   TL;DR: Despite the cool choice system, the art style, and the story, the game falls flat. The core aspects of the game such as the combat and character leveling/abilities are bland, and the length is appallingly short. The game does have replayability, as you can pick different choices every playthrough, but personally, the incentive of a different outcome is not worth playing anymore of the combat. This game simply isn't worth it. Maybe in a few years when its dirt cheap or comes with the supposed other 2 games in this trilogy. As a standalone game, 24.99 isn't worth a decent story and some pretty pictures. Especially since the combat feels like a chore, especially after you've seen how the short story ends.",

The different take on turn-based combat was cool at first but quickly turned stale. None of your choices matter: you are always forced to take a certain path. There is no point in really trying to choose what to do with your reknown (the games currency); if you use it to level up a character, that character may die or leave and you have absolutely no control on whether or not this happens, if you use reknown to buy supplies, those supplies will be destroyed or stolen regardless of the choices you make. This 'game' only gives you the illusion of choice and the battles are basically a minigame. The Banner Saga is a visual novel that pretends to be an RPG.",

As someone who enjoys games primarily for the story, such an unsatisfying denouement taints the whole experience. The rest of the package is developed to a point that is more than satisfactory, but when a game is centred around the plot it seems rather silly to leave in such precarious shape.   I won't delve into details, but a significant proportion of the interesting strands of the plot remain unresolved (or worse, unexplained to begin with) and the tale's rather clichéd conclusion fails to have any emotional impact due to the lack of character development over such a short timeline. Unfortunately for me, The Banner Saga (at this point) remains a cautionary tale of how not to deliver on a very promising premise. Again, I really wanted to like the game... but I didn't.",

Not that that makes any difference because the amount of people you have with you means nothing to the game. The very few full scale battles you get into are staged because you haven’t gotten to a point where you could have lost members of your caravan.  Being able to purchase items is also a joke because if you care about your people even in the slightest bit then you will just be using your renown to buy supplies and leveling up your characters, who just wind up dying off at the slightest whim anyways. Ill mention Egil as an example and I know that it’s supposed to be an achievement to keep him alive, but really? Is the life of people just a joke/game?

            "review_text": "As many have already mentioned: Utterly fantastic art, especially in landscapes. Beautiful, high-res, hand-drawn. It's just gorgeous to look at. The in-game map is beautiful, too. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the soundtrack here, which is excellent and fits the world and the story incredibly well. The lore is pretty deep. A lot of work went into the world-building, and it shows.  As far as tactical gameplay, health and strength occupying the same function is brilliant, and the way armor and strength affect damage dealt is ingenious. Willpower and exertion are further interwoven, creating depth. It's fantastic and it works to provide the best tactical aspect of the game.  However, combat design overall often feels a too raw and underdeveloped at higher levels. For example, why can't I check out my characters' stats while deciding who to use for the battle? Isn't that sort of important? Why isn't there a range attribute? Am I just missing it? I understand that shieldbangers move more slowly and have less range than other units due to their heft, but it'd be awfully handy if I could tell just how far they'd be able to move when placing them. Same with enemy units. There's just too much missing here. The basic premise involving strength, armor, exertion, and willpower is solid and incredibly innovative to the genre, but some major fleshing out needs to happen in order to get me more invested into the tactical combat being presented here. I often feel like I'm floundering, like I don't I have enough information to even begin to approach a battle tactically. It takes me out of the experience and I just tend to float through battles rather than plan and execute an actual strategy. And that's a very, very bad thing for a tactical RPG.  I also question the system of having each side alternating moves, rather than assigning characters a speed attribute and having that govern when turns are taken and by whom. There's a huge missed opportunity here that would greatly affect the Man vs. Varl unit selection and it would help to balance the two units. Instead it seems they tried to balance them by making the Varl bigger and less maneuverable, but I don't think this works nearly as well. I ended up selecting mostly Varl units in each battle simply because they were the hardiest and I often didn't feel the desire to try and play tactically. Just roll the Varl out there with an archer or two and have them smash heads while the archers wear away the opposing units armor. A speed attribute would have added a great deal of depth: Do you opt for speed and maneuverability and quickly bring the fight to the opponent? Or do you go with a solid front line, advance slowly, and wear the enemy down while tanking through whatever damage they deliver? It would have added a ton of tactical depth that this game is missing.  The interface has some issues. You'd better be 100% on-point with your mouse clicks, otherwise you'll have to try and figure out where you went wrong, select the same unit again, and start from scratch with whatever you were trying to get him to do. It's way too easy to click the wrong thing, and just not intuitive enough to prevent regular frustration from occuring when you're trying to get your units to do what you want. There are similar issues with selecting units and placing them prior to a battle. This is a minor gripe, but by the end of the game it was incredibly frustrating to miss a click on a willpower star by a fraction of an inch, and have to select the character and tell him what I wanted him to do from scratch.  Though the art is very well-done, I felt some of the character designs were too generic and too difficult to tell from one-another. There are a few Varl units who are basically just palette swaps from one another with very minor differences in facial features. Due to this, and not being able to view any details about a unit prior to selecting them in battle, I had a lot of trouble keeping the characters straight and often made mistakes during deployment that could have easily been avoided had I been allowed to view more details about which units I was actually selecting for battle. I mean, it doesn't even tell you which class a unit is on the pre-battle screen -- Just their name, level, and a picture of their face. No class, no stats, nothing.   Weak characterization makes the problem even worse. I often confused Griss and Bersi, and by Chapter 5 I had no idea which one was which and often made mistakes in deploying them. I found it hard to get invested in any of the characters. None of them show any depth, and the only one written with any panache at all was Ludin. Poor dialogue exacerbates the characterization issues.   Decisions are too frequently unclear about what you're actually selecting. I don't mind having things blow up in my face, but I need to be adequately informed on what it is I'm choosing to do. For example, you arrive at a fortress and enter, only to have enemies immediately attack it. You are given a choice as to whether to rest in the fortress, or immediately attack and attempt to break out. This choice is followed by another, in which you choose the actual tactics of your breakout. So you've got two choices to make at the same time, but you have to choose whether or not to rest before you're able to see what your options will be during the actual attack. Jeez, this is getting complicated... Still with me? Basically, you're forced to make an initial choice (whether or not to rest first) without adequate information to make the decision. If I had known that I'd have liked to charge the enemy and attempt to eradicate them all, I'd definitely have rested first. If I was going to try and distract them and get away, I'd have chosen to attack immediately to prevent more from arriving. The character I'm playing would have had all of this knowledge in his mind while making the initial decision as to whether or not to rest -- Why don't I? This kind of thing is present too frequently, and it leads to way too much frustration. It cheapens the decisions you're making.  Losing characters to decisions made through the game, rather than in battle, is something that keeps the intensity up, but overall I don't think it works nearly as well as Fire Emblems system of permadeath within combat. It puts too much of the onus on the story sequences and takes away from the importance of the battles. If you're in this for the story, that's fine, but it lessens the importance of the tactical game and makes it too easy simply to trudge through battles without really caring what happens. Halfway through the game I began to just autopilot my way through battles. I lost my sense of investment in my units and my tactics and started to get bored of the entire actual game. I bought this for the tactical gameplay, not the story, and so I came away very disappointed.  Summary:   The landscapes are beautifully rendered, the lore is surprisingly well-written, and though the characters are pretty weak, the story is engaging. Unfortunately, the tactical combat as a whole leaves a lot to be desired. It's solidly constructed at its base and its key gimmick (strength and health occupying the same stat, and weaving armor into the mix) is incredibly innovative, but too often I felt there wasn't enough detail or I didn't have enough key information to dig in and play tactically, which lead to me becoming utterly disinterested in the actual tactical gameplay about halfway through. I ended up switching it down to easy and blasted through the game just to see the story.  If you're looking for an engaging story framed in a beautifully constructed world, then you'll probably enjoy your time with The Banner Saga. As a tactical RPG, though, it's seriously flawed. The systems in place are intriguing but ultimately too raw and undeveloped for me to really endorse. So as a longtime fan of the genre, it's hard for me to recommend this game.",

Most of dilemmas are extremely vague and outcome is impossible to predict, Which leave you totally out of control. The most of the 'choices' you are asked to do looks like this:  'You have some free time at your hands, what should you do:  - Take a stroll to the forest  - Sleep  - Help around caravan'  Hmm, dunno lets help?    'You tried to help farmers to milk cows, unfortunately you scare poor cattle off and they run away stomping your fighters'  -50 supply; -50 fighters, one of your best heroes is dead, haha.  The game is forcing you to play Russian roulette and one random choice will cost you a good party member (and resources you spent on him will be lost forever). It has nothing to do with harsh challenges or survivor simulation, its plainly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. And of course there are no saves (only auto save), no fun allowed. I am totally ok to lose heroes or resources if it was my fault as player - bad decision making or whatever but this is just frustrating.   2. The game has no text backtracking or some sort of journal to keep all names and lore peace together. And overall introduction to the world is done badly.  3. Caravan management is part of the game but you have no tools to predict how much food you need and how long it will take to travel to the next city.  4. Combat is a bit repetitive and has few major flaws in mechanic.  5. No real freedom, the only things you can do is to save few your party members that's all. Game is story line driven.   While I was not severely disappointing with this game I can't recommend it, especially if you don't like rogue-like games. But with good walk-trough in hands could be fine.",

That  would  be a great idea, if it were well executed. Unfortunately, some   incredibly   poor design choices early on ruined what would otherwise be a great game.  The big problem is that most of the battles are very easy, but winning even the easiest of battles without losing heroes is nigh-impossible. Most people, myself included, would assume that means the game is incredibly well-balanced. Unfortunately, it's actually because of two game-mechanics which do not work well together  AT ALL .  The first game mechanic is that a unit's attack power is equal to its health. This means as a unit takes damage, it becomes weaker and less useful.  The second game mechanic is that turns alternate by side, rather than by unit. In other words, if I have 4 units and the enemy has 2 units, each of the enemy's units gets to move/attack  twice  for each one of mine.  Stop and think about what these mechanics mean together. The weakest unit on the enemy team is always the one with the lowest health. If you kill him, his turns don't get removed, they get replaced by a stronger unit.  That means every time you kill an enemy-unit, the opponent-team gets stronger.  EVERY TIME!    This has three consequences. The first is that you're basically guaranteed to lose some heroes in every battle. Every time you kill an enemy-unit, their team gets stronger. Once they're down to two units, they'll be attacking one of your units 3-4 times for every one time it attacks back. Couple this with the fact that the AI seems to always target a single unit with all of its units, and it's basically impossible to survive without losses, even when you massively overpower the enemy. That's not fun.  The second is that most battles are very easy to win. Every time  you  lose a unit,  your  team gets stronger also; so after losing a few units, the battle becomes much easier.  That's not fun.   The third consequence is that the best strategy for almost every battle is to get all the enemy units down to 1-2 HP before killing any of them. It's a very boring strategy, which leads to a boring game.   That's not fun!    The game does have other issues  (such as seemingly benign choices resulting in the deaths of your heroes outside of battle) , but none anywhere near as frustrating as the broken battle mechanics. If the devs would fix the broken battle mechanics, I would give the game a thumbs-up; but for now, I can't recommend this game for any price, even free. It's simply not fun.",

The only real let down for the majority of the game is the vicous spiral of defeat you can fall into, if you lose fights, you need to spend supplies to recover strength or you continue to be at a disadvantage. However, the currency for supplies (reknown) is also the currency for leveling your characters, so resting to recover strength = lower levels, which means you lose more fights, which... etc etc. To compund this, if you run out of supplies your moral drops, this affects your combat performance significantly... which means you lose more fights, so you get less reknown, so you can afford less supplies... etc etc AGAIN.  All of this would still not be enough to make the game drop too much in review, however right at the end you have a blatantly unsubtle 'pick who dies' moment that is shoved in your face and are then forced to take specific characters you may not have leveled to the the final fight, which is... ridiculously tough. It is clearly meant to be tough battle and I would expect no less, but instead of being maybe 50% tougher than previous battles it is 150% tougher. Many people have ended up dropping the difficulty to easy, which is instead a 50% *drop* from the normal difficulty and ends up giving them a frustratingly pointless win. I persevered and beat it on 'normal' (which is, bizarrely, perfectly balanced the *entire* rest of the game to be challenging but winnable with tactics and forethought).  I'd almost suggest simply stopping at the last city once you meet 'Juno' as the game after that point appears to have been designed and written by different people who haven't played any of the rest of it, but that would end up probably being just as frustrating as the end is anyways, which abruptly stops after the fight and a short cutscene and gives you absolutely no closure to any of the major plot points or characters except one (who's dead)... ultimately, I can't recommend anyone buy this (even on sale) as it will leave a sour taste in your mouth at the end and ruin the excellent gameplay that came before imo.",

The gameplay is challenging, especially in evoking the grim feeling of scarce resources and harsh choices. You can build your characters up for combat, or you can try to keep your people alive, or you can do both poorly. There will never be enough currency (Renoun) to manage both. They managed to keep me interested in the civilians and the story enough to actually care about the choices I made, and agonize over the risk of starving them all to death in the cold. They built up an epic plot with several layers that were just coming to maturity when, out of nowhere, and with no warning at all, the credits start rolling. You finish a boss fight, that one of the characters even comes out and says won't actually kill the big bad guy, just put him down for a while. Enemy army - still rampaging through the world. Big world crisis - still utterly untouched and in full swing. Personal story - also still in the middle of everything.

If they had either finished the rest of the game, or made it clear from the beginning that this was only Part 1 of several, I would have been so happy with it. Instead, I'm left dissorientated, unfulfilled, and rather irritated. Maybe they were more upfront about it with their backers, but I missed this Kickstarter, and all I know of the game is what was listed in Steam. Sorry, but unless they patch this with the rest of the game that they left out, I can't recommend this to anyone. Such a shame to waste so very much potential.",

Pros:  1) Interesting art, beautiful visual aspects that reminsce of old folk tales and Nordic history.  2) Average soundtrack which varies throughout the game.    Cons:  1) Your thrown into a story line with no explanation of whats going on, with names thrown around like you have read a 10000 page novel knowing whos who. 2) Extremely repetitive play style with taking obscure decisions that randomly vary the outcome. 3) Very mediocre fighting system, and outbalanced play style. 4) No strategical aspect to fighting system.  5) No depth to characters which also seem to betray or leave your party with no premade decisions that effect the game. 6) Extremely boring. 7) Worse turn based fighting style I have experienced, which reflect on the number of players on the map.   All in all I thought the game was a big disappointment.",

My little bug makes all the text blocks of color. The only solutions I've seen is the did you update your video driver crap. No I just use video drivers from 10 years ago. Reminds me of the Windows 95 days. Yeah I was gaming then too. Every time you bought a game you got to pay 50 bucks to see if it would even work. When you contacted technical support all they could ever tell you is update your drivers and good luck, but back then only half the games worked anyway. Standards were all over the place and still evolving. Today most games work no problem. Like most of the 100+ games for Linux I own that are fine.   In other words is my system really the problem or is it maybe something else? I think this is just one of those games that is too buggy overall for the developers to catch up with and fix it all.

Important points on which the plot hinges, like the deaths of certain characters, may happen no matter what choices you make to prevent them.  Combat was also severly frustrating. Power isn't effectively balanced between party members or against enemies. Skills are downright wimpy. Characters are capable of dealing less damage as the battle continues, so things can crawl to a standstill, like when only two kings are left on a chessboard.

Pros: +cool world/setting +gorgeous artistic/visual style +nice soundtrack +the plot/story seems interesting, but...  Cons: - (the plot/story seems interesting, but...)...it's INCOMPLETE. Gee, I sure wish I had known that ahead of time. I mean, I wish I had known I was paying $25 for what seems like only half of a game. The game just ends abruptly -- no closure, no cliffhangers, no build-up to a 'Part 2', nothing...you're just playing the game, and then, BAM! the credits are rolling. I remember thinking to myself  'Wait...WHAT?  Is this game glitching out here? Why am I seeing the credits when I'm only halfway done with the game? Shouldn't credits come at the end? This can't POSSIBLY be the end!' To add insult to injury, the game's description fails to mention to the customer that they are only buying half a game; Likewise, I couldn't find anything on the game's website that mentions this either. I guess the studio just conventiently 'forgot' to tell us that. Anyway, being charged $25 for an incomplete game left me feeling burned. So don't buy this game unless it's AT LEAST 50% off since you are only getting 50% (or less?) of the game. -Although the premise of the story/plot seems really interesting, it is poorly executed. The game is EXTREMELY linear...to the point where, as a player, I usually felt I was being totally railroaded. Sure, there are plenty of choices to make along the way, but it often seems as if these have only a minor (if any) impact on the overall gameplay or story arc. For example, 'Do you choose A or B? If you chooose A, one of your characters dies. If you choose B, another one of your characters dies. Basically, no matter what you choose, we are killing ONE of your characters right now! Ready?' Anyway, as you can imagine, that gets old pretty quickly. -Overall, the dialogue is poorly written. In fact, it's laughably bad, at times...like something from a low-budget B-movie. -the combat system is pretty good, but not perfect. It has a few obvious flaws, in my opinion, and it takes a bit of getting used to. It can still be fun once you get the hang of it.  So, in short, this game has tons of potential but the cons outweigh the pros.

If you screw up in a fight - and you will - then you'll have to go back a good ways - often scroll through tons of dialogue and animation just to get back to the fight. This is game design 101 folks. You don't do that. Never. Ever. But because decisions affect how a fight starts then you'd need two saves - with the latter being at the beginning of the actual fight itself so you don't have to go back through all the extraneous stuff simply to reload the fight.  That and there are some other little niggling issues like only being able to move once as opposed to having move points - which is hella more strategic. So if you screw up and move to the wrong spot you're screwed. And it sucks that you have to count squares before moving your archers to figure out if they'll be in range or not after they move. No interrupts, no saving move points to adjust position, etc. means it's all pretty bare bones strategy that gets boring and frustrating fast. A million other games have done this a million times better so it boggles the mind that the designer wouldn't have learned that by now. Maybe it was the budget limitations, I don't know, but it's a royal pain in the ♥♥♥ and a disservice to an otherwise beauttiful game.

In order to promote a unit, that unit needs to get the last hit on a bad guy. Then you have to spend the only resource in the game, renowned in order to get points (2 per level) to spend to make your unit more powerful. That is obtuse enough, but it gets worse. That same resource is what you also must spend on food to keep your people from starving to death. The game has little replay value as you are railroaded the whole time. The world map has no reason to be in the game as it is not used for anything. There will be a good, neutral, and bad out come to many of the random encounters that pop up as you wait to get from place to place. Given enough time you could find what answer A B or C is best. So those encounters aren't choices, they are only consequences. The UI is a bit odd at times, you can't delete your last played game.

I didn't even mind the twist that others had mentioned, mainly because no one died in mine, and a hero I'd never spent much time on left the caravan.  What utterly destroyed this game for me was the final boss. The difficulty spike is something else. You spend all this time fighting minor battles - I think I lost one, maybe? - and then you're confronted with this boss that requires you to have levelled up very specific characters and focused on armor-breaking, which I wasn't aware of. I spent my renown on supplies and didn't realise what armor-breaking was really used for, since at no point was that explained. So when I got to the final battle, and was essentially penalised for playing the game in the way that I had wanted to (which is supposed to be an important part of this), it left a sour taste in my mouth. If I had chosen specific characters to focus on, never purchased supplies, and entered every fight I could, the final battle would have been a breeze. But I didn't, because I thought the game was about choice, and I didn't realise that any choices I made that weren't the ones intended for me by the creators would eventually screw me.  It should be just as hard to win the final battle if you choose one character over another or focus on some skills over others. There should be some sort of benefit to buying supplies so people don't starve to death rather than levelling up your characters. All roads should lead to Rome, if you get what I'm saying; you shouldn't be penalised for playing the game in a different way to the unexplained 'optimal' one. Sure, choosing food over strength should penalise your ability to fight somewhat, but it should also net you some reward. The choices you make shouldn't be dead ends; they should lead to a different outcome. And that outcome shouldn't be win/fail.   The struggle of having to re-evaluate all the tactics I'd been learning through the game, of trying to figure out what they meant by 'shoot when his armor is weak enough', of having to include characters I hadn't been levelling to win, of facing a boss that is ridiculously powerful with no precursors, of dealing with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ tiring AI... it ruined the game absolutely.

That being said, you eventually have to play the game. The game is like Oregon trail, where you lose supplies/people because you didn't guess the right prompt. The story is told though dialog boxes which severely disappointed me considering the opening annimation was awesome. Then the rest was just a guy standing there in a picture with a dialog box; he doesn't move his mouth or motion, just a portriat of him. Then entire game.  Combat has.... some..... stratagy to it. Armor and strength. You wittle away armor and try to take away as much strength as you can before the enemy does. In same cases, the AI doesn't play statigically and just hits the closest thing to it. In some cases they focus one target until it is dead. increasing the difficultly only adds more AI with this midset. Of course, you play the same tactic, only to realize each hero can only level up by last hitting the enemy. So yea, some stratagy.  Some spoilers beyond this point but was my biggest gripe with the game. The story is cut half way through the game, leaving alot of room for a sequel. Though, trying to justify the price of $25 for a story that is cut just at the good part made me feel more conned then hoping for a sequel. Kind of like Halo 2 'Sir, to finish this fight' CREDITS!",

There is no mention on the store page that this game is not finished, and that is unacceptable.  Again, Do Not Buy this game.",

It combines oregon trail with something like fire emblem or FF Tactics and if it were just that I would probobly love this game to death.   Unfortunately, I can't reccomend this game because there is such an overwhelming amount of unneeded and completely uninteresting storyline you are constantly forced through. I just popped back in to play, for example, and couldn't actually play any game for over 10 minutes because I had to watch 80's style cartoon characters I couldn't care less about blather on to each other. I'd hate to know how long it would have taken had I not been wildly clicking to just get past it.  To conclude, the gameplay here is awesome except you rarely get to play the game. Most of the time is simply spent wasting time in a way that isn't even entertaining.",

            "review_text": "Absolutely gorgeous game that quickly becomes incredibly unenjoyable.  The ambience is wonderful, and the pacing of the travelling mode is slow, it was a nice experience.  Character levelling is annoying, in that your characters earn the ability to level up, but you have to expend scarce resources to level them up, meaning in reality you can advance only some characters a handful of the levels they're able to.  Decision making is incredibly frustrating, as you often have no idea what's going to happen from a decision. One choice made in a very early part of the game results in the death of another character towards the very end of the game with little apparent connection, and if you levelled up that character too much, god help you, because that's all been wasted now.  Combat system is also just, really, bizarre. I like turn-based combat, but this game alternates between sides every action, regardless of unit-count, leading me to adopt a strategy of crippling enemies but leaving them alive lest a healthier enemy get their turn. For example, if you have four fighters who have been weakend from the battle but are in reasonable shape, if there is only one strong enemy you neglected to damage earlier, every time one of your characters moves/attacks, that single strong enemey will get another attack. Similarily, if you kill an enemy right before it's turn to move, it's basically a wasted action because some other, stronger enemy will move in it's place.  Ultimately there was a lot I liked about the idea of the game (art, story, characters) but could not get past the combat, the character levelling, and frustrating decision-making process.",

It could just be me, sort of like The Witcher 2 has a command line fix on my distro, and I am not bothered by that and it fixes that, but I've seen nothing on this game talking about this broken game. The first battle looks bonkers and everything is upside down and mixed up, barely even distinguishable at all. You can hear sound but even that is really messed up. I believe this is an Android port. I would not not recommend this on Linux, perhaps the Android game is ok I wouldn't know I don't have a phone or a Nvidia Shield or anything. I am sorry to post a bad review but this is the only game in my library that is totally and fully broken.",

It paints an amazing picture that sucks you into the story.  Unfortunately, the end of the game, particularly the final 'boss' fight, ruins the game for me. The boss fight is a lesson in tedium and gives an artifical difficulty in cheap tactics and requiring exactly one tactic, despite however you've played the game prior to this.  And after that boss fight? Nothing. The game ends, tying up absolutely nothing in the story. Supposedly it's meant to be a trilogy, but it ends at such an underwhelming spot in the story. It's like if Star Wars ended when the Millennium Falcon escaped the Death Star, and you had to wait for the next movie any sort of resolution whatsoever. What kind of climax is that?  Worse, the 'boss' at the final battle is ultimately meaningless for the story, which combined with the stupidly frustrating fight leaves a sour taste in my mouth.  I really, really, really liked this game until the end.  So I cannot recommend it. The world it built is amazing and I want to see so much of it, but the story is very slow and methodical, and ends abruptly and without much progress. My mind may change when the sequel (or sequels) is done, but at this rate I would recommend waiting until the creators have finished weaving this so-called saga.",

Enemies aggro your strongest warriors, who do less damage the less health they have. Dredge enemies need to be weakened of their armor first, meaning that they'll be chipping away at your health and so by the time you're you know, READY TO START HITTING THEM your warrior will have like 1 hp left and thusly do a maximum of 1hp of damage.  It's just insanely terrible, and there was also a major glitch that caused only 1/4 of the screen to appear halfway through my game. This is ♥♥♥♥ing disgusting. This game is a year old and they have amatuer glitches. Glad it was a steam sale thing, and I will never buy the sequel.  Had to turn down the difficulty on the final boss because it was such ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Don't give me any ♥♥♥♥ about being a casual either, I finished Dark Souls on my PS3 only one assist on a boss, the firekeeper. So ♥♥♥♥ this game, ♥♥♥♥ the idiots who developed it, anyone who is a fan of this pile of ♥♥♥♥, and YOU for considering it.",

Love the art and the music and looked forward to a long intresting single player campaign with an epic story and gripping dialouge... The story is 'meh', the dialogue is 'yeah whatever'.   Besides the fighting system, which i somewhat enjoy, the game consists of a dialogue guessing game which is suppose to have an effect on the world. Alot of the choices you make either has no effect at all or instantly makes you lose one of your characters, often in ways that doesnt make any sense. And as you progress through the game you can suddenly find out that you for unexplained reasons have lost even more characters since the last chapter, which at some points leaves you with a bunch of low level characters in your party. I understand that all not all dialogue choices can have forseeable effects, but in this game the effects are sometimes just plain absurd and frustrating.",

People looking for a good RPG should look elsewhere. People looking for a good tactics game better do the same. If you do want a tactics based RPG similar to this that is actually good, have a look at Shadowrun: Dragonfall and Shadowrun: Hong Kong. Wildly different setting, but I cannot think of a single thing Banner Saga does that the Shadowrun games don't do much, much better.",
