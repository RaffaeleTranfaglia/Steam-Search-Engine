            "review_text": "Me and my boyfriend played Resident Evil 5 coop where the first player controls Chris and the second player controls Sheva. We had many fun moments but also many frustrating moments. I was very unsure if I should recommend it to you or not.  Let's start with the positive things. It's a really good coop action game, one of those where you have to stay together and really cooperate. The game has many environments, cool combat music and great variety of bosses! You and your partner can tease each other with your character's voice commands. We were shouting at each other a lot and it was very entertaining.  In my short clips video you can see all the good things I was writting about. We were really having fun and laughing a lot:   Fun Times in RE5 - Clips    And here comes all the criticism I need to share with you. The Steam PC version of Resident Evil 5 has many bugs and complicated mouse+keyboard controls. I don't like quick time events very much. But the weird combinations of buttons in RE5 are unbelievable. Sometimes A+D and sometimes F+V with very short time to react to that. I watched some gameplay on consoles and they only had to press one button on their controllers. It's even more annoying during cutscenes when you sit back, enjoy and don't expect anything.  Another unpleasant moment is when you find out that you as Sheva won't get the steam achivement for finishing a chapter if your partner's game crashes or if you decide to stop playing in the middle of a chapter, save the progress and finish later. Only Chris, the player who host the game, will get it then.  It happened to us that an important enemy with a keycard we needed spawned in an inaccessible area, I was locked in a cage and my boyfriend spent quite long time trying to get there while I was waiting and waiting for ages. We tried it again and this time we only saw his shadow on the floor. I tried to use explosives so we got him down from that unknown place this time and luckily it was on the right side.  Another very annoying moment was the final boss fight where you have to press F as Sheva for almost a minute. Not just that but you have to do it SUPER fast. You kind of need to be like The Flash! I played this game 6 years ago as well and I remember I had to give up back then. It was not possible. On my last playthrough I tried it so many times and I managed to do it only once.. My finger really hurt, so I had to ignore the pain and was lucky my boyfriend didn't mess it up after that so we could continue. Uffff! These moments definitely made us want to ragequit..  RE5 Bosses in general can be very annoying. When you are not doing the right thing - shooting the right spots at the right moments , you are basically wasting your ammo and the game won't give you any more and it won't make you fail either even when you clearly can't do it. You just have to decide for yourself to restart from the last checkpoint.. But in case you somehow manage to do it but you already wasted all your ammo before, good luck to you, because you can't buy ammo directly. However you can buy weapons and sell them so you keep the ammo they had.  Final verdict: Partly recommended! Overall I am very hesitant in case of Resident Evil 5. I am a fan of RE games. I like the coop option of it. But all the bugs are breaking the full enjoyment of it for me. I believe the console version is much better! If you love Resident Evil games and you have the patience to deal with it, go for it! Wait for a sale, please. Don't pay the full price for something what couldn't have bugs fixed since 2009.  Thank you for reading my review! In case you have some questions feel welcome to ask me :)",

However, Resident Evil 5 is very addictive and very fun to play. I can't get bored of it! On my crappy laptop it plays, surprisingly, very well! It may not be perfect 60 fps but it does sometimes exceed 30. Graphics are beautiful, and my brother's PC runs at over an average of 150 FPS. I, for one, am not knit picky about graphics or single frames, and I very much enjoyed how the game looks on my laptop. I saw the true quality while observing my brother's computer, as we played CO-OP Story Mode, beating Normal, and just finishing up Veteran, and soon Professional, and the graphics are unbelievebly astonishing! Great work, CapCom! I've been playing this game and beat it on different consoles such as the PS (or perhaps XBOX) for a couple years now and this game never gets boring for me! Thanks so much for an awesome game! ~3~",

            "review_text": "I spent countless hours on RE5 on xbox 360. The PC version has great graphics and still delivers dynamic game play, however it does lack local co-op :(. All in all, definitely worth a purchase on sale.  RE5 takes place in Africa with Chris and Sheva, agents of the BSAA group which contains bio-virus weapons. You are basically fighting zombies with some cognition about what's going on, they aren't blindly stupid walking around like most zombie games. Rather, these 'infected' come at you from all sorts of angles and drop down from all sorts of heights to greet you with a chainsaw, machete, crossbow or just a good old fashioned hammer. Characters vary from simple opponents which can be taken down with a few shots, to heavier opponents that may charge or swing obscenely heavy weapons at you.   What makes this game so good though? At first, I hated the game layout as it was tough to access my equipment menu or to pull out my gun. I should say that you CANNOT fire from the hip. You have to aim down your sights first in order to get a shot off. These two reasons sort of put me off but as I got deeper into the story, I got pulled in and liked how they intermingled melee with the ability to shoot opponents. You CANNOT simply press a button and start hitting someone. Just like pressing two buttons to get a shot off, you need to hold LB (to pull your machete out) then hit RT to get a hit off. This is one melee mode, the other involves 'stunning' the opponents (boss's and regular opponents are susceptible to this) and then running up to them and pressing X which usually knocks them on their bum. Additionally, when the opponents are on the ground the player has a moment to curb stomp them (as seen in Gears of War). This melee mode is very particular, just as the entire game is made this way. You do not feel in complete control of the game until you've familiarized yourself with the game mechanics. Either you'll hate what Capcom did or you'll like it, simple as that. When you recognize when an opponent is stunned it makes a world of difference. I should also add when your partner is being held down by a zombie, the other partner can run up and press B to free the partner. I'm going to say it again even though I already said it, you'll either get along with this sort of game mechanic or you'll find it annoying you can't simply fire from the hip or melee at will. The movement controls over all feel smooth while the camera cannot be moved from an over the shoulder position. I have to give them credit for trying to include a wide variety of weapons from rifles, shotguns, automatics and pistols. On top of that, incendiary grenades, regular grenades are also included with a compliment of herbs that you can mix to heal yourself (or your partner on the fly). There is a slight RPG element to the game where you can upgrade weapons for better impact and a quicker reloading scheme. I would highly suggest spending your money wisely and choosing a weapon you know you'll be using a lot.   The graphics as I've mentioned are a lot better than xbox 360's version, everything feels smooth and the cinematics are pretty tight. The sounds are decent and do not really sound different from shot to shot, or when you break a barrel. The opponents also sound generically the same (unless you're facing a unique boss).   Overall, if this version had local co-op it would get a higher rating. Since it's a PC version and apparently we don't play local, it's going to hurt it's score a bit. None the less, a great game and would highly recommend it on sale.  RATING : 7.8/10        Gameplay   B     Story / Campaign   B     Visuals / User Interface   B     Sounds / Music   B     Replay-ability   C+     Overall    B-    ",

            "review_text": "RESIDENT RAMBO 5  Actually this should really have been called RE4 Part II or perhaps another REVLATIONS title, nevertheless I am giving this a thumbs up because I bought it in the Summer Sale for Six Dollars, if I had paid full price then maybe I would have differen't opinions about it.  As others have mentioned as far as gameplay and progression go this is almost a carbon copy of RE4, with a couple of really good (and sadly very short) 'Operation Wolf' Type levels thrown in at the half way point, suffice it to say this is a big budget 'Switch your Brain Off' shooter with the bizzare addition (experiment?) of an AI partner system for sol play which isn't too much of a problem for the First Half but then gets to be a BIG problem. More on that later...  Everything about this game is BIG, Cinematic and Bombastic and for the most part it looks really good even though there is a distinct lack of variety in the Scenery. With a few exceptions the graphics are all a mix of South African Shanty Towns with Mad Max that make up Roughly Two Thirds of the entire game. The cutscenes are done in that dramatic Shaky-Cam style, which was very trendy when this was released, and on the whole it holds up very well for it's age. Running on a NVIDIA GTX 870 this is smooth and flicker free although there are some serious bugs on the Tanker Level that make progression next to impossible depending on what loads and what does not.  So what of the actual Mechanics and playability? Sadly this is a complete Train Wreck that is WAY too complicated to use and slowly gets worse as the game progresses making it virtually impossible without the use of a controller. Even so when it comes to the Boss Fights and later the Maze and Corridor levels you will spend most of the time either looking at the keyboard or controler rather than enjoying the action on the screen. Making matters worse there are way to many intrusive Quick Time sections that invade the levels and the Boss Fightswithout warning which also change the keys each time causing the player to be looking perminently at the keyboard and missing the action. It is also in these stages that the really bad AI of the partner becomes apparent and it spends most of the time blocking you in corners and getting you killed. There really should have been an option to play without it and I am Amazed that this was not offered.  By this time CAPCOM had already gone too far away from what RE is meant to be and it is evident that they were listening to the 'Suits' rather than the fans. It is also evident that they were trying to be like the RE Films going so far as to transform Wesker from an interesting 'Bond Villian' with character into an evil superhero part NEO Part Darth Vader. The two versions of RE should have been allowed to exist as completely seperate entities.  What we have here is really a long version of MERCINARIES.  In conclusion I cannot really complain at Six Dollars, so it is for that reason I am giving it a thumbs up, but I would not have been so sympathetic if I had paid full price.   PS Trivia......did anyone else notice that the music between levels is a slowed down version of the Ocean Theme from Mario 64?",

            "review_text": "If you ask any Resident Evil fan their opinion on the latest installment of their beloved franchise, they will likely tell you how far it has fallen from its roots. Some would consider the first Resident Evil game a pioneer of the survival horror genre. With scarce resources and a daunting atmosphere, the game made every encounter felt tense and nerve wracking. Resident Evil 5, released in 2009 and a good 13 years after the first game, took this formula and turned it upside down. Maybe the creators felt that the series needed to evolve. Perhaps they wanted to cater to a wider audience. Regardless of intent, this significant change was poorly received. But contrary to what the most hardcore “fans” have to say, Resident Evil 5 is far from a bad game.  The thing that struck me immediately as most impressive about Resident Evil 5 was its game engine, one internally developed by Capcom themselves. It is extremely optimized and capable of rendering impressive visuals at playable frame rates even on low-end systems. Unfortunately, Capcom never capitalizes on its engine’s abilities. Instead, players are treated with boring brown scenery after brown scenery. It would have been a pleasant surprise to see the engine render something other than foliage and sand so that the audience may witness its potential in full.  If you came into Resident Evil 5 expecting a thought-provoking plot driven by ethical dilemmas and life-changing lessons, you really should first reevaluate what you think narrative focused games are before looking elsewhere. Resident Evil 5 doesn’t aim to be a social commentary (and if it is, it probably does so unintentionally). It doesn’t aim to make its players question their morality. It just tells a simple story of two agents trying to stop the outbreak of a virus and honestly, that’s all it really needs, since the main driving force behind this game is its solid gameplay.  Resident Evil 5 can be played solo or with a friend. Prior to release, this was a very controversial inclusion as the community argued that co-op would diminish any sense of horror. While this argument is valid even today, having a partner to play with actually enhances the game’s enjoyment by allowing two players to share the experience of being overwhelmed by zombies. Even if you do prefer to play alone, the game forcefully pairs you with an unresponsive A.I. partner, so ultimately co-op is still the lesser of two evils.  The aforementioned major addition aside, Resident Evil 5 feels and plays very much like its predecessor bar the horror aspect. The controls are extremely responsive and every bullet fired or punch thrown has an “umph” to it. If you’ve never played the previous installments, you might be disappointed to find that the characters cannot shoot and move simultaneously. While unrealistic (and occasionally frustrating), this limitation does make a rather laid back game slightly more intense during fights against overwhelming odds. Staying true to its heritage, Resident Evil 5 also retains an inventory system that encourages players to be strategic with their supplies. With only nine available slots, players must give careful thought to how diverse of an arsenal, how much ammo, and how many herbs (essentially potions) he or she should carry.  Resident Evil 5 gets a lot of things right and had it not carried the burden of following its predecessors, I suspect it would have been wholeheartedly accepted by the gaming community. As long as you keep your expectations at bay, I can guarantee you that there is much fun to be had, especially when playing with a friend.  Grade: 4/5",

Is the PC version different from console version? Well there are only two things worth mentioning. Instead of the classic laser for aiming you are given a crosshair, this isn't really a big deal once you get used to it. Another thing is that the controls are a little clonky on the PC, but after about 2 hours of getting used to them, they won't bother you at all. Awesome game! It was great to relive all the cool moments this game had!",

Thats what co-op brings to Resident Evil 5.  That is the stuff of dreams of any original RE gamer. Take yourself back to '96. You and your mates taking it in turns to play, we dreamed of two player, this game delivered that. Ok not the authentic or classic RE experience, but RE5 does what it does very well.",

Very arcade-like and mercenaries mode is a blast. I recommend it whole-heartedly.",
