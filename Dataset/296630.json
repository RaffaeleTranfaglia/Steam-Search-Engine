            "review_text": "Now, this is one game almost solely dedicated to the notion of SPOOKY. The other recurring theme is MODELS: No, not the wafer-thin things which caper about on cat-walks, but rather a three-dimensional model of the title building and its attendant rooms/sections (an absolutely ingenious device which you'll just have to play the game to 'spoil' for yourself), as well as some of the hands-down scariest bronze statues/art models you will ever have the good fortune to be terrorized by.    I gotta say, it's always nice to be so pleasantly surprised by a game you didn't even know existed until it was already available in the Steam store (the last such game for yours truly was perhaps Outlast, so this title is in mighty good company therein). This isn't to say there aren't a few problems, however...   Firstly, the Steam asking price is a tad silly for a game which even I managed to complete in under two hours ('cause believe me, I play games kinda sloooooow). The project is apparently the product of university students graduating from a game design course, so within those parameters it's impressive as hell, but it doesn't hurt to recognise that even the very best of such projects can't exactly go head-to-head with the 'big boys', especially price-wise.    Secondly, there's a fair few glitches...on more than one occasion, I had a particular enemy permanently freeze on me; which might almost sound like a 'good'/opportunistic thing, but decidedly less so when you require said enemy to cause damage to something in order for you to progress.    Also, I had a hell of a time getting a couple of objects to successfully interact with what they were SUPPOSED to interact with. I especially had no end of fun trying to get a round ornamental medal thing to go into its appropriate slot in a wall...thought I must be missing something...looked up a video walkthrough and lo and behold, the dude playing it gets it in first go without even trying. One game reboot later and I finally managed it, but again not quite as promptly as Mr Walkthrough did, so...yes, problems, it had a few. I did however break with my usual cheapskate tradition (of waiting for a decent sale) and bought this game smack-dab on its release date, so perhaps these little bugs will be corrected with time...   On the whole, though...VERY impressed. Expect big, big things from the people involved. For now, this one merely qualifies as just a single 'big', but there's no doubt there's some talent involved here. If I were their teacher, I would definitely give them an 'A' (but not quite an 'A+')...but since I'm not a teacher, I'll simply rate them in my standard manor (whoops, make that 'manner'), and round off my review with the customary:  Verdict: 8.5/10.",

            "review_text": "This is an indie gem and please do not get repulsed by a mixed vox populi.   Firstly, this game is super short. I have finished my first playthrough in about 1.5 h taking my time to read all notes and paying attention to details. My second playthrough in which I aimed to get to the alternative ending took me about.. 27 minutes... the plot is simple but engaging, there are scary moments, but enough to remain scary, not frustratingly repetitive. The atmosphere of the old manor is felt and the graphics are surprisingly good conidering this is an indie title made by students (as far as I know).   However what makes this game unique is the concept of dynamically creating the environment around you, which certainly should be developed into future, more complex project.   Consider this game as an indie with a lot of potential to become a successful aaa if developed with proper amount of money and resources.   This game if deffo worth getting on sale r in the bundle. You will not be disappointed.   Also, I would recommend to all Cube (the movie) fans.. for a valid reason :)  7/10 = a solid short indie title, with nice concept and neat graphics",

            "review_text": "I have to say one thing about this game, which is that the graphics are absolutely gorgeous. The details on every inch of the game you encounter looks amazing and sets the perfect mood for the game; cozy, yet spooky. Also, the concept of being able to move different modules of the manor around is quite unique and interesting.  However, you don't get a lot of context as to what you're doing in the Kraven Manor apart from reading notes, which nobody really does. At some parts I even got a little bit stuck because of some unclear guidance, where the enemy kept touching me in inappropriate places. I think they could've done a little bit more work on that.  Another thing is that you need to properly WANT to survive in order to feel terrified by the enemy, which usually isn't the case with horror games that have monsters with some impressive artificial senses and intelligence. This means it's as scary as you want it to be, instead of forcing it upon the player.  All in all, I do enjoy playing this game and I would recommend it to anyone interested in horror games. If you need a little bit more context about this game, I would suggest watching my playthrough. You'd get a pretty good impression on what it's all about:         YouTube™ Video:  DAT ♥♥♥ - Kraven Manor part 1&nbsp;",

I got the first room, plopped it down, and couldn't figure out how to get into it by the time the tension had mounted too high for me to be able to keep playing. SUCH atmosphere. SO scary. Wow.  I have no idea how this game has such low ratings unless these people just don't like being scared because this game is SO scary! And a cool idea! I wish I had the guts to play it. *shudder*",
