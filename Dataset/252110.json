            "review_text": "Since I will be living away from my brother for some time, I decided to take up on the game and offer him the chance to finish a co-op playthrough. It would be nice to play some local co-op games before I leave, and Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime had given us a enjoyable experience.  The first time we launched the game it was from my brother's Steam account, so we stopped halfway through the first cutscene to change to my account, which owns the game, just so I can get some trading cards and achievements.  Both times we watched to first cutscene, my bother would always tell me that I'm gay. Maybe because it's called 'Lovers' in a Dangerous Spacetime, but I had figured it was fine to play with my brother.   The first boss we came across taught us that the game would be a ton more challenging that it seeemed. We had died an enless amount of times to that boss, because we lacked coordination. My brother, a true lover of the Souls franchise (I am one too), complained that the bosses were way too hard, and 'I'd rather finish our Kirito and Asuna builds in Dark Souls 2.' But I convinced him to keep trying, well, more like I forced him to.  By the time we defeated the second boss, which was suprisingly easy, our coordination had improved signifigantly. We would man the turrents, the shields, and drive at the same time. Still, we often found ourselves rushing to the love portal at the end of the level with the tiniest skimp of health.  In summary, the game has you and your friends working together in different roles to defeat the antilove monsters, and though this shared experience will reinforce relationships as well as build new ones. Of course, it is frustratingly dificult, but that just means you and your friends will feel more acomplished when you win. Don't be fooled by the title of the game, play it with your guy friends or gal friends. Heck, why not all of your friends in 4-player co-op? (assuming you only have four friends, which I totally feel ya). Very fun and frustrating local co-op. 8.5/10  Oh, and by the way, we did play this on two player co-op normal mode.  'Just restart the level until we get the last metal gem we need to wreck the boss with our rocket launchers! They do soooo much damage OPOP.'",

            "review_text": "Great and highly recommended Couch Co-Op game for parties!  At first glance you might think this game might be difficult to play. But in reality the concept and controls are easy and very fluid. The only difficult/crazy part is how well you can coordinate with your fellow players in order to control each subsystem effectively. As it will have you constantly scrambling from system to system the whole time in order to maneuver the ship and successful defend it from enemies. The great selection of difficulties feel to be tuned fairly well to suit whatever experience you wish to engage with your friends. May it be a more relaxed sit back experience to one that will have you on the edge of your seat screaming at each other. The choice is yours.   The animation and art style is very well done for cinematics and gameplay. And honestly I don't think the trailers do a good job at really justifying how well it all comes together. So go watch a gameplay video on youtube for a better idea then what you see here.  Highly recommended for gaming groups that like to get together in the same room. As it will be worth every cent once you get into it.   Or if you are the sad lonely type. At least they programmed a alright AI buddy to assist. Even if its not the greatest at times. Though if you plan to play this by yourself. You might be a bit disappointed.",

But, maybe that's just me. Thumbs up for a game that hasn't forgotten about people who like to be physically in the same room, there's not many good games today on PC / Steam making local coop enjoyable, possible and actually purposeful.

This game has an amazingly imaginative art style that I haven't seen in any other 2D game before. Somehow Asteroid Base have managed to design something that looks cute, sharp, vibrant and colourful, yet doesn't feel childish or cringeworthy.  This is without a doubt one of the best coop-games I have ever played. Especially because it allows you to have lots of fun right from the start. Unlike some other games, where it only really opens up if you reached a certain level or got a particular upgrade.  My only complaint from the 3 hours I have played thus far is that the upgrade system can be a bit unclear at times. Why is it that I lose my upgrades between worlds? I suppose this is because of balance reasons, but this isn't communicated to the player in any way.",

For singleplayer though, I suggest you look elsewhere. I suggest you watch some reviews first before making this purchase.  From a singleplayer perspective, the gameplay does not flow smoothly; it feels very 'stuttery'. There is quite a bit of micromanaging in this game, during battles you: command pet to a position, move your ship, move your shields, hop onto a turret to shoot a bit, and then repeat. Throughout the fight you're not feeling engaged in the combat, it's more about moving around so you don't get hit and let your pet do the shooting. Overall it is just not fun, well to me anyways, to just move a ship around and not being involved in the combat while the A.I. does everything else.  If this were just a singleplayer game only, this game would get a 'thumbs down', but since there is local co-op and everything about this game is very unique from art style to (co-op) gameplay, this will get 'thumbs up'.

Don't get this game if you for instance have a lover in another state who you met on a hookup app who, you know, you can't call right now because they're like, super busy being a model on a yacht or something.

The overall design is excellent. There's a tutorial level that is almost a little bit too long and slow, but effectively gives you the basics. Once you're fully kitted out, the world is yours to explore, and the game doesn't explain anything to you any longer. What's neat is that it *doesn't have to*. The game mechanics are easily discoverable and are almost always a delightful surprise instead of an annoying interruption.  The graphics are bright and attractive. The music is perfect. The controls are the perfect mix of smooth and frustrating.  The weapons are nicely balanced so that they never really feel overpowered, never get difficult to use, but still can reward players for their skill.  Now the bad, because there IS bad, I'm afraid: The game is probably easiest to play with gamepads. However, in the version shipping when I wrote this, there's some terrible defaults configured, and dual gamepads won't work right. Gamepad + Keyboard won't work right. In general, nothing's going to work right with two players right out of the box. But, if you know that, and are prepared to remap all the controls manually, your patience will be rewarded.  Oh, by the way: The game does have a single-player mode... but you shouldn't really bother with it. This game should really only be played with two of you side by side. If you don't have two game pads, and don't have ... uh ... any friends ... then you could skip this game. Otherwise, you should have this game!",

I recommend this if you are a good multitasker and like a challenge because this certainly is one.  I think I prefer to play with another person but I'm probably better alone just because I don't have to communicate with myself.  Not related to game play, the story and graphics are very cute. Still wouldn't recommend getting it just for the cute story like I did, expect some panic when you're fighting.",
