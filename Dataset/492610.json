            "review_text": "UPDATE: OK...with a little more time in, some points for you to consider...none of which are game-breakers for me, or enough to rescind this recommendation: I don't see a way to change the controls...I'm a mouse/keyboard guy...or in this game, keyboard only. Though the controls are easy to use, I know some folks might object for whatever reason...just sayin'. Also, nowhere to save your progress. If you don't make it to the end of a level, you start over...both while in-game and after exiting and starting again. Even with that, it's not unusually tough to get through a given level...a good tip for that is taking some of the coin you earn on missions, and using it to boost your character's strength, agaility or defense. It's the quickest way to get through levels.While there may be a way to get around either issue, I have not discovered it. That said, I still am having a blast with this, and neither issue detracts from my real enjoyment AT ALL. I remain VERY happy with getting this game...but since I seem to be the lone review thus far, I figured these may be important things for some of you. This remains, for me, one of my (already) favorite platformers in a LONG time, and the chiptune song is pretty awesome.  ORIGINAL REVIEW: I can already tell this is an awesome game!! A smart, fun platformer, living up to its trailer. Normally I'd wait a bit longer to review...but there wasn't any feedback at the time of writing this. It's worth getting!! If you like platformers with some good action, smart responsive controls and fairness...this is already better than most, with 20 min. in at first writing I can already tell it's going to be a fave of mine...at least wherre platformers are concerned. Thought I'd let y'all know that...lol.",
