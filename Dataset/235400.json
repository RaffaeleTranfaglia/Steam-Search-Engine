            "review_text": "I love the King's Bounty games, I really do. But King's Bounty: Legions just doesn't feel right. All of the elements that made the previous games interesting were removed or tweaked to provide the most bland and generic experience possible to the player.  In this game, there is no specialisation, you can spend your gold on marginal upgrades for units and spells, but cost scaling and level requirements for these upgrades is made in such a way that you can't just decide to dump all your gold into spells and rely on them. Especially since you can't learn spells, you have no mana, you have to buy scrolls, every time you use a spell you need to use a scroll.  When it comes to army building, there isn't much to it unless you are willing to pay, you have access to some basic units from shops, and a few advanced units as quest rewards, but only enough to show you what these units can do and encourage you to purchase more at the real money shop. You just don't get the satisfaction of doing your best with limited resources like you did in the previous games, especially since morale mechanics and most of the units special effects were removed.  Finally, you don't have to select your battles like in the previous games, here you simply progress from one area to another with the ability to grind when you feel you aren't strong enough to take on the next challenge.  The only thing that's left from the previous games is the turn-based gameplay, which just isn't enough to hold the game together without the strategic elements that the previous games had.",

That little fact, above all else, absolutely ruined this game for me.  However, the game is free, and like I said, it can be pretty fun. If you're broke and looking for a turn-based strategy, this could be a great little time waster for you! I don't think you  lose  anything by not connecting with facebook, but you will be annoyed by the constant requests to do so (at the end of every quest / battle).  Honestly, the devs made a decent game. I'd love to give it more of a chance, but the whole facebook thing just throws me off. If you don't think that something like that would bother you, you should totally check this game out.  5/10. Wonderful game absolutely ruined by Facebook Nagging.",

            "review_text": "This game looks artsy and colourful up front, and i had high hopes. after playing age of wonders, i thought i'd come into this game to have fun. The first thing that put my hopes down, was a facebook login. I got very frightend at the idea. most facebook games are bad, and this game follows that trait.  Bad musics and sounds. i wish i had the sounds off, it was awful, it wasn't enjoyable at all, and worst didnt fit anything i was doing.  Art design. i still don't know who the ♥♥♥♥ was what and why they did what they did, after only 2 battles. i could barely tell if there were assigned colours or not. this got even more confusing when the 'turn based' element was implemented poorly.  Gameplay. how do you mess up turn based, first it's someones turn, then its the next. in this game it thinks every character is a different player, and it's quite confusing at times to understand what the hell is going on. this isnt like final fantasy X, where it had a neat little side bar to say, this person is next because they're fast. there is no warning, or understanding. (unless i had to read that, which i didnt)  Tutorial. god knows if i even finnished that tutorial, but it was awful. a bunch of text with no highlights stopping me from playing how i wanted to. it forced me to use elements that at the time i thought were a terrible idea. it even stated for me to kill the big guy first, and not giving me much option, or reasoning. i should be lead to do what i want, not be forced to.  The end of two levels. After the two levels i played it led me to some sort of buy screen. i don't know what i was doing when i was in that screen, whether i was buying more units, or buying backup units. but the idea was i had to use in game currency to do so, and with that, i left. I do not wish to spend days playing a game, to get some currency to get higher level items. theres no fun. no race differenciantions, nothing.   Again, comparitavely to games we've seen 10 years in the past, this game is still rubbish in comparison. an epic battlefield, consisting of 5 blokes with rope for pants and 5 meters appart fighting over something probably as trivial as a stick.",

I was hoping to find some kind of atlantica / HoMM 3 like game. I have never been so wrong about a feeling. If you are looking for some sort of game like those 2, this ain't your game.",

Basically do not read and just go where the icon puts you, battle, win and claim the reward. Nothing overly hard there. And with one of the packs it's even easier because you really PAY to WIN your battles with big, bad beasties.  But the thing that annoys me the most is every 2 battles that ♥♥♥♥ing pop-up to share gold with your friends on Facebook. Guys, we're on Steam. No Facebook at all there (aside from the connection Steam opts for screenshot sharing). I'm really not gonna give this game (or any other app for that matter) access to my Facebook account!  And then I hit level 8 and get 2 quests I MUST connect to Facebook to find other players to complete the quest. NO ♥♥♥♥ING WAY! I'm done with this game. As I said before - I AM NOT GONNA LINK TO FACEBOOK YOU RUSSIAN MORONS!  Good thing the DLC pack came from a bundle. It was fun while it lasted (2 hours) and am not gonna touch this one again.",

            "review_text": "I'm kind of saddened by this game. After the wonderful Armored Princess, Crossworlds, and North King's Bounty games, Legions comes in with not much changed graphically. What they have changed, though, is that it is now Free to Play. While I am fine with this in general, this is one of those F2P changes that feels wrong given what the game is about. In the past games, you could in theory stack your army with very powerful units (although a low number since your character level and thus 'Leadership' is low) if you won early battles and knew where to recruit. Replacing this deep and interesting mechanic are paid 'Starter Packs', which are not nearly as diverse or interesting as a custom crafted army, or you can buy Booster Packs or units with real money.   Even this state of affairs could have been remedied if I had some early access to a wide variety of units, some of which would be the higher tier units. This is simply not the case almost 10 hours into the game. I am stuck either rolling the 2-3 strongish units (even though my Leadership could support 6-7), or having to constantly spend gold on a very sparse selection of troops to replace heavy losses from crappy troops. I mean, I shouldn't have to buy Archers as my only replenishable ranged choice. At least open it up so I can recruit any low level archer.  I really hope the devs go back, do a proper update of the engine, and release a game for $20 and remove the game killing mechanics that support the F2P model. It just doesn't work for King's Bounty.  You're better off buying the earlier games.",

Even though I knew it was free and I know that any developer doesn't work for free, I expected better than I got.  No matter what you are being told otherwise, this game is pay to play. It is one step worse than pay to win. Even though it looks like you could progress through the game in the early stages, sooner than later you'll run into the problem of having to grind the same levels all over, just to get some low-tier creatures. Forget about the higher level or even the legendary. You need them to win, but you'll be lucky if you get them from a lucky chest or as an in-game reward.  Eventually you'll get stuck, having a mediocre army, mediocre artifacts and nothing left to do other then to grind the same levels over and over again.  The PvP sucks as well. You might get lucky if there are players roughly on your level, but you could just as easily be paired with either a very high-level opponent or someone who put cash into the game and easily kicks your ♥♥♥♥.  Story is almost non-existing. Spells are limited in usability, fight-map is too small. The game is also pretty slow, in having to always load (maybe synching with the servers?).  In the end, I just deleted this game (level 22) and just re-installed HoMM5.",
