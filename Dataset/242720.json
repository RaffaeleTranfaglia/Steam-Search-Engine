Maiet should have put GunZ 1 on Steam, instead of this game, or just upgraded the graphics on GunZ 1. The game currently suffers from low player participation with less than 400 players online at any time. The game lacks a deathmatch mode, though it does have a team deathmatch mode.",

It was an amazing game that rewarded coordination and aiming. The community used to be really strong and would often find new tricks and make the game even harder to master.  K-style was an unintended thing that made GunZ great and they simply decided to turn their backs on it and on the community that made their game popular.",
