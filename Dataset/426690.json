    "description": "&quot;Life is like a waiting room, except people don't leave in the order they enter.&quot; Narcissu is a thought provoking visual novel series about terminal illness, living, dying, and the relationship between those leaving and those left behind. There are no miracles, no heroes, no villains in this story.",

            "review_text": "NOTE: I played the prerelease version given to Kickstarter backers.  If you haven't played Narcissu 1st/SIDE 2nd, you should look at the reviews for that first.  Right now, the 10th Anniversary Anthology edition includes Himeko's Epilogue, which wraps up the events with Himeko from SIDE 2nd. If you enjoyed the first two games, then you should definitely get this for the story - it's short (maybe not even an hour long) but gives you that final sense of completion. This version includes some new art: unlike the original two games, the art is detailed, depicts the characters often, and fills more of the screen. It also includes art that is similar to the original games. The new art is well done, but nothing special.  This also includes 1980, a short story by the author of the Narcissu stories. It's quite short and has the same general theme as Narcissu 1st. If you're a big fan of the series, you'll appreciate it, but it's nothing special on its own, in my opinion.",

Despite my best efforts I couldn't keep myself off it for more than 2 or 3 days after I played for a tiny bit to check out the changes from 1 and 2. Having finished it I loved it and am very much looking forward to the next games that are still to come!",
