            "review_text": "(EDIT) First things first. What I've of played of this game is incredible. You care about your troops even though you can make new ones just like Dawn of war. There's plenty of additional defense strucutures to build like Barbed Wire, Tank Traps, Mines, Sand bags and turrets, all of these reuslt in the perfect defense if placed correctly. You can choose whether to play as Axis or Allies, in my opinion the Axis are more fun to play as but for the Allies it's cool to drop troops from Air control onto the battlefieild using battlefield perks - They are basically specific types of troop reinforcement to use such as: Plane and air control, Artillery, etc I recently came across a problem whilst playing the game, It was entirely not the games fault, I'll leave it in the bottom of my review so that it explains the comments.    I am new to coh. So I downloaded the Demo a few weeks ago and being a fan of Dawn Of War and WW2 immediately loved what I saw. So I decided to purchase the full game in eager anticipation.I had purchased the New Steam Version and Southern* Fronts DLC. After installing I launched it and couldn't play half the game because It said 'You require the original Company Of Heroes gme to play this.' Even though I had JUST downloaded it. I went ahead and waited for the DLC to install and loaded that up. Exactly the same problem. I then got annoyed and wanted to play the damn game, so I set up a Skirmish match. the building models and soldier models were gone, only their shadows remained. I looked up a soultion for the problem and someone mentioned changing the grapchical options so I did... It caused the game to go to a black screen and immediately crash. Not happy at all.",

You're Relic, and you've just made Company of Heroes, what many consider to be one of the best RTS games in a long while, perhaps of all time. After a series of patches where you've basically changed numbers at random while sobbing into your keyboard and wondering how Blizzard does things, you've finally managed to achieve a semblance of balance in the multiplayer metagame. WHAT DO YOU DO?!  If you answered 'introduce two ridiculously broken factions that, even if you iron out the multitude of bugs infesting both of them, are going to be very difficult to balance even for people who know what they're doing, which you clearly do not,' then you win the Imagination Game because that's what Relic did.  Thankfully, though, one of the unbalanced factions is the British, so you get to listen to British accents, including their ridiculous pronunciation of 'Lieutenant.' Do you see an 'F' in there? No? Exactly.",

OF adds the British and the Panzer Elite factions into the game. Britian is my personal favorite faction, and it favors strong, fortified defence and a generalized infantry-centric army that can deal with any threats, athough not reallty specializing in any field. Meanwhile, the Panzer Elite (Poorly named as they have only one actual tank) focuses on an extremely offensive and mobile army in which highly specailized vechicles perform a narrow role, and thus every unit serves a spefific purpose. Both factions are extremly unique, and do not feel like retooled American/Wehrmacht. OF also adds two new campaigns for the two new factions. In all, if you loved CoH, you will adore the hell out of this expansion.  NOTE: Getting this expansion only, without the base or Tales of Valor, means that you will only be able to play as the British or Panzer Elite.",
