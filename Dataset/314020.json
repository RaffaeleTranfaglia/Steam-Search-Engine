            "review_text": "Nice as an art gallery, but awful as a game. The bugs move reeeeaally slowly. I know how fast bugs move in real life. I have seen them. Why do they move so slowly here? There's no reason other than to draw out the gameplay way longer than it needs to be. The game isn't very good at letting you know what you can and can't do. The only way to move is to hold your mouse down in the direction you want to go, but you can only go along preset paths, and some of the screens are in places that don't even look like paths and feel like you'd only ever find them on accident. It's basically a glorified hidden object game, except everything is so vibrant that the stuff you have to pick out doesn't tend to stand out enough. There were a few instances where I wasn't even sure what exactly I was looking for.  The minigames are generally alright, though there's two that are abnormally challenging compared to the rest of the game. The flower bud puzzle especially, which is painful both because of the puzzle itself and the fiddly controls. It's very short. 5 small 'levels'. No real connecting story except that you play as the creature you helped in the previous level, and at the end you open a door and then the screen just fades out. Abrupt. The game looks very pretty and sounds pretty nice too, I'll give it that, but it's slow and frustrating for what should be a relaxing experience, and not worth the money for what little gameplay is given to the player.",

            "review_text": "Morphopolis is a gorgeous P&amp;C game bringing you through the life of a bug that morphs into other forms as it completes its journey. Where that journey goes exactly, is not really known, but you will point and click your way through several beautifully designed levels, finding hidden objects to unlock puzzles and continue onto the next stage.  The music is rather relaxing and don't get old too quickly but after a long while, you may just want to mute it and play your own music instead.   The puzzles aren't too hard but will require a bit of your brain to solve.  My biggest gripe is control. As you are controlling your little critter around, sometimes it gets confused or locks up and goes back and forth back and forth cause it doesn't really know what you want. Instead of pointing and clicking and your creature going there, you have to hold it, and not al paths are self-evident.   The game moves at a very slow pace, so if you're not in a realxed mood, don't bother to play it or you might get frustrated with the slow speed. Personally I think the game has no replay value, but for such a cheap game, did you really expect any?  Overall 6/10 - Get it on sale for an interesting mix of art, music and puzzles.",

It features vibrant art and combined with some cool puzzles. The game has you search for items hidden all over the screen in order to progress further. Some of the items are actually hidden quite well. After obtaining the items, you are then subjected to a few unique puzzles in each area (a total of 5 areas). The puzzles were well-made and felt just about right. They were neither too easy nor too hard. Overall the game took me about 2 hours but that was definitely 2 hours well spent.  4/5",

            "review_text": "Interesting concept of the game. Hidden object is the most accurate description, but it certainly isn't a standard game from that genre. There is no story and still you can follow the 'plot' pretty easily.  The presentation is unique and the music fits the atmosphere nicely. The animations aren't perfect, but again fit the style of the game very well. The controls aren't that great and guessing where to go and/or how to get there can be a bit frustrating. The controls just work well enough to finish the game, but you will run into some problems with them.  Another small issue is that you have to move between screens and it is awfully slow. It's a design decision to include this 'mechanic' into the game, but I don't think that it works particularly well. Still it only slows the rather short game down, so it's really not much of an issue.  Is the game worth to play? Yes. Is it worth 5$? Well, no. It is quite short and offers no replay value, so get it in a sale or from a bundle. That being said try to get in the next proper sale, as it is a worthwhile experience :)",

            "review_text": "A beatifully drawn game with an equally beautiful soundtrack. I can recommend Morphoplis if you are looking for a serene experience of clicking hidden objects and solving puzzles. It is let down somewhat by the slow and clunky movement in the game, but given how simple the gameplay is, I can excuse it. The first time I played it though, I couldn't work out even the basic movement, which is essentially point in a particular direction and hold down the mouse button.   There are only certain paths you can follow through the foliage, and it's soon obvious where these paths are. The learning curve of working out what on earth you are supposed to be doing in this garden somehow adds to the dreamlike quality of the scenery, and there are no textual or spoken cues to stop you thinking like an insect interacting in its natural environment.  You should come to Morphopolis with a relaxed frame of mind, because otherwise you could get easily frustrated. It's the gaming equivalent of getting in touch with nature and living among the flowers. It is a very short, casual game, but leaves its mark on you, showing what else games can be than blood-thirsty war games.",

            "review_text": "Visually, this game is nice. Control and documentation/instructions, this game is not so good.  I picked this up on sale for $0.19 USD during Steam Summer Sale 2015. The value of the entertainment provided is at least worth a dollar, so this was in my opinion a good value.  This is basically a hidden object/click and find game with a few puzzles thrown in. There are 5 levels. A short game, but fun enough. The puzzles are a nice easy casual level. The hidden object portion is clunky. You usually have at least two different screens to look for your objects. Your insect starts in one corner of a screen, you click and hold to tell it where to go. You have a hint box in the upper right corner. You can use it if you get a bit lost. It takes time to replenish. The insect moves slow and the paths are not always clear/easy to navigate. You spend a lot of time going back and forth.  Some of the puzzles are not so evident as far as what you're supposed to do. For example, there is a puzzle that is basically a peg game. You have a grid of objects with the center unoccupied. You need to jump one object over another to remove it from the grid. Repeat until you only have one object remaining. Pretty simple. The problem was that there were no instructions telling you how to do this. You need to click and hold then drag. Artifact of being a mobile app/game for a touch screen?  The background music, is just that, background music. It's not an epic fighting game, it's a puzzle game, so the music is repetitive new age sounding instrumentals. Easy to ignore, but really, nothing bad.  Overall, get it on sale and it's worth a few minutes of distraction.",

The only frustrating bit is that the puzzles have no instructions and the hint button doesn't work when you are completing one so the first bit of many of the puzzles is clicking around the screen to try and get something to work. Also if you quit halfway through a level it doesn't save it for you.  It's a nice game whilst it's on sale but I don't think I would have purchased it full price.",

The puzzles fit the theme, and while some are easy, others are trickier due to no instructions. The final puzzle made me rip my hair out before I finally managed it. The game is short, at just around 2 hours, but the price is unbeatable. At full price, it's worth it, but you can usually pick it up for just a few cents. At the time of writing, it's only 24 cents!

            "review_text": "Morphopolis is an 'art game' if ever there was one. I say that because I believe for this particular game the art is the priority. That's not to say there isn't interaction but its gameplay is quite simple. I'd go as far to say that the gameplay is designed to make sure you focus on and absorb the art. The eye candy is nice but it takes more then that to design a good game.  In Morphopolis you play as different bugs who are kind enough to help out there neighbors with different chores. Then at the end of each stage it appears you transfer yourself into a larger bug whom you'll play as in the following stage. There isn't any written story instead the game leaves it up to you to interrupt the meaning behind you're actions. Even beyond story-telling there isn't even guides to tell you where to go or what to do. Restricted movement and actions is enough to let you figure out for yourself what you need to accomplish.  This game is super stylized. The consistency of the art work between each stage is spot on. The stages split across multiple screens which connect seamlessly. The art is this Morphopolis is stunning. The paintings are incredible and make you really focus when trying to find the objects you need. You'll be looking at every little detail as your eyes slowly inspect the image.  Essentially, this is a find the objects game. As you play you'll come across particular plants and bugs that stick out from the backgrounds. Each of them will ask you to find a set amount of particular items for them. You'll need to carefully scan the backgrounds and gather up all the items. Then proceed to deliver them in order to clear a path or initiate a special mini-game puzzle. All the puzzles are very different and I believe this is were Morphopolis loses it consistency. Until this point the game is fairly easy and relaxing but a couple of the puzzles are incredibly challenging. This very bizarre difficulty curve takes you out of what is otherwise an immersive and enjoyable game.  Very stylized and original, the only thing holding this game back from is it's struggle balancing. If you think this might be a game you'll enjoy don't let that hold you back. That being said I'm sure some people will really enjoy that added challenge. Those who are worried about getting frustrated can always minimize the game a bring up walk-through for the really tough puzzles. As I said before art is at the core of this game. This is an array of visual stimulation that will let you relax and lose yourself in the world. Look else where for a more interactive and more traditional 'game like' experience.",

First off, there’s no real option menu, which annoyed me at first since there’s no way to change the volume nor a real interface. Clearly this is more suited for an iPad where you can sit and relax with just your index finger but I’m so happy that I played it on 1920x1080p since the graphics are amazing. The artstyle is colorful and it helps when it comes to how the puzzles are built, forcing you to admire the artstyle while playing. This game is slowing down the pace, forcing you to actually study the environment in search for clues or hidden key all while listening to a wonderful soundtrack that’s soothing and mysterious at the same time.  There’s a downside though, the controls can be clunky and the insect you’re playing is moving so slow which makes it mildly infuriating when it comes to running back and forward when it comes to solving puzzles. Yet, this was an amazing gaming experience, and this is coming from someone who usually ignores the puzzles and ragequit while pretending to be intellectually superior since I haven’t let the game prove me wrong.  HIGHLY recommend.",

The concept was pretty straight-forward and the puzzles were stimulating enough without being too over-demanding. I actually found it easy to unwind whilst playing this - the colours and sounds created a soothing effect. Morphopolis was compared somewhere to The Room (another game I loved immensely). My experience of the two games differed in that I completed Morphopolis in one sitting, whilst with The Room I reached several points where I became stuck and had to take a break before resuming. When I played Morphopolis there were five levels and they didn't take too long to get through. It would be nice if more levels were added or a follow-up released.  This is a great game and I highly recommend it to anyone.",

This point and click adventure game about being an insect and finding pieces to advance into the levels and fix your friend so you can become them. kind of.  5 unique levels as different insects and new areas offers a relaxing time for children and adults looking for a slow, stress relieving game. This game has ambient music and pretty, colourly art that lightens up the game.   Remember: If you leave anywhere in a level without completing it, you will need to start over. There are no checkpoints.  The game is simple to play, relatively straightforward (some instructions are missing which slowed down gameplay even further) and has 8 puzzles of different skill levels (4 easy / 1 normal / 3 hard)  It has a decent help system with a button you can press for the next objectives location that recharges over time. Sometimes instructions are no clear and will leave you guessing and clicking everything on screen to get to the next location. The game can feel like it takes forever due to the slow game progression and the constant walking between zones. Negative or positive I leave that up to you.  Puzzles are not explained very well, so some of them can be hard or difficult not because of the puzzle itself but the lack of information going into the task.  Its a nice relaxing, colourful artsy puzzle game for the child at heart.   It's only 1$ and has about 2 hours of gameplay.  Personal Rating: 3/5 ",

However it is not without its flaws, firstly the movement of your little aphid is very awkward and slow. It takes some getting used to. Some puzzles are very frustrating not due to difficulty but to poor control. For example one puzzle sees you try to turn piles of seeds into 1 pile using checkers moves.
