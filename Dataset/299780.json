            "review_text": "Noir Syndrome is an interesting game. It tries to bring in something new to the Rogue-lite market, by putting you in the shoes of a private detective. From there, you have several places to visit to gather clues and suspects, while trying not to step on the wrong faction's toes.  While the concept is fantastic, the game's scope is much more modest. I was expecting much more from it, and it's not what it was trying to deliver.   Sessions last about 15 minutes.   There is a rampant murderer in the city (for cult reasons), and you can visit every landmark freely, spending one day to explore each area. I was expecting a bit more FTL or WeirdWorlds influence, with a deep lore that one could discover by playing it over and over again, but this is purely a mechanical game. Unfortunately, its mechanics are not robust enough to carry it, in my opinion.     Presentation   The game's artstyle is not beautiful, nor unique. You can probably get that from the screenshots. But it's functional, and to be honest, it didn't prove very relevant in my enjoyment of the game. A great artstyle would certainly make it more enjoyable, but I could distinguish everything of important here, so it's fine.    The  Music , however, was pretty neat! As you would expect from a Noir game, it features a lot of  Jazz , with a bit of chiptune influences at times, and also Classical music in a couple of places (expensive hotels and the hunting club, for example). But for the most part, it's jazz. And it fits the detective vibe perfectly.   It's not something I'd listen to on my own time (it's simple, and not a lot of variety), but I didn't feel like turning it off while playing the game!      Now that this is out of their way, I'll explain how the game works.   You have 14 days to explore the city and find out who the culprit is, and bring him to justice. You have various different areas of the city to explore. You can explore one each day.  In those areas there are objects and people. In a restaurant, for example, you can speak to people there, and also explore the seats and tables for clues. Each area functions similarly. This exploration phase plays like a 2D side-scroller.   People can be either of 2: normal people, and sellers. Normal people can give you suspects (or give a very generic and not very convincing argument against them being a suspect... just flavour text), while vendors will try to sell you Food, Lockpicks or Bullets.  Examinable objects can also give you Locks, Bullets, Money, or Clues.  You'll need  Locks  to open doors or steal from vaults, and  Bullets  to... well... kill people. More on that later.    Clues  are a bit more interesting (although not too much). For your deductive reasoning, you'll have to find suspects that fit certain criteria. After you learn about a person, you'll know all of their attributes. Clues will provide you with the killer's attributes.  Each person has a  faction , an  occupation , a  gender , and a  name . The faction includes Police, Mob, and Civillian. Occupation can go from Artist or Chef to Tailor or Driver. Once you think you've found who the killer is, you check him on your notebook, and his location will be shown on the map.  Every clue is about the killer. This is very important (and also a big issue). No matter where you find it, the clue is always about the murderer. Also, the clues are  Binary . A gun holster, for example, tells you (s)he's either from the Mob, or the Police. An ornate fabric tell you (s)he's either a Tailor, or a Dancer. And so on. There can't be contradictory clues, so you'll end up collecting just enough to find which aspect is common between them.  If no one fits those traits, you'll need to speak to more people to get more suspects.  ---  This is a very uninteresting way of making you a detective, isn't it? There's barely any brainwork from the player! It's just about running around the place, inspecting every random background object (because that's where you get clues), and then finding the right choices. It doesn't feel like you're playing a detective, and every game ends up playing too similarly.   Since every clue is about the killer, you don't really need to go to the crime scenes or follow leads to find anything about him(her). You can just explore any place that's convenient to you, and you'll easily succeed. This is probably the biggest issue I have with it. There's not a lot of thinking in this game, and it completely takes the 'detective' part out of the game. ---   On the City, there are different possible events. There are Civillian Gatherings, Police/Mob takeovers, Crime Scenes, and fishy places. About he latter, I have no ideia... You get that information from the people, but there is nothing different in those areas.  The first 3 are areas dominated by said faction. This is relevant when you killed someone from the Police/Mob and left witnesses, or stole from either, as factions can then be hostile towards you, and shoot on sight. On Hard mode, there's always an hostile faction from the start.  CrimeScenes are areas without people, where you can look for clues, without the risk of getting murdered.     Other than that, one important aspect is the Hunger Meter. Yes. This has a ♥♥♥♥ing hunger meter.  I'm sorry, that's rude. But seriously... Why?!  The game has nothing to do with survival, except for the fact that you have to buy food not to die. Each time you examine something, or open doors, you'll lose 3 points. A piece of food can give you from 100 to 300, depending on the price. I guess this puts a stop to spamming Z constantly, but it doesn't feel necessary to have such a 'feature'.  ---  This is a good segway!  The game is far too easy. There aren't too many suspects, and it's easy to find his attributes from the clues. Normal mode is not challenging at all. Hard Mode, can be fairly challenging, but for the wrong reasons. Food could be one of them, but you learn to play with it. The main reason is the factions that's trying to kill you. You have very limited bullets (1-2, usually), so you can't just kill everyone, which is good. However, while finding clues is very easy, finding all the suspects can take more effort, especially, when there's a faction that will kill you immediately, and there may also be hitmen on you, that seem to spawn randomly. You can literally enter an area and just die, because he was right in front of you, and you couldn't escape.   This helps the game having challenge, but still doesn't feel like being the detective was the focus. The detective part is a very thin layer, surrounded by all these other systems trying to keep you from examining it closely. ---   I think I've covered most of it. It's a purely mechanical game, of getting clues and suspects, and then arresting them. Killing them ends the game, but not with a victory. There are some special systems, like stealing from factions (that ♥♥♥♥ them off) or killing everyone in an area not to leave witnesses, but those play a very minor role in the overall game. This is because the game isn't hard at all! When you die, it's mostly out of your control.   The only narrative, is present in the murderers appartment, where there are random logs (6), with a passage of his Egypt-mythology related killing spree. Nothing substancial at all, though. There are no interesting plots throughout the city, no lore, no interesting random events, nothing of the sort. It was what I was mostly looking forward to, unfortunately...    Conclusion. It's not an awful game. It's actually pretty solid,  for what it is . If you're looking for a very simple game (perhaps a good first project), then go ahead. I enjoyed the game, but I don't consider it great at all. Lots of wasted potential, but an interesting effort nonetheless. Only higher from here!",

            "review_text": "The thing I really liked about this game, is that I as I got to understand the dynamics of the gameworld / exploration elements, I started finding the clues I needed faster, and succeeding more. Like Binding of Isaac, it's less about a single play that weaves a story, as the way different failures lead up to a run where everything falls into place, and you realize you've developed the skills to make use of it.  I would recommend this game, but be aware that the action and story elements are very minimalistic. Like a lot of classic and retro titles, it's the limits and balance of the game that make it a unique and enjoyable experience.",

And also they should allow you to be able to find bullets as you investigate.",

Cutting to the chase, I enjoy this game. It isn't a complex game, nor is it one that you're likely to play for hours on end. What it offers is a quick, stripped-down murder mystery that you can play through in some spare minutes. Waiting for a file to download, on a teabreak, or just want something to occupy yourself with while waiting for your brain to start working properly, the game gives you a pleasant little diversion for that time. So, don't buy it if you're expecting the indie LA Noir. Buy it if you often need something to fill five or ten minutes.",

            "review_text": "Current playhtough has me enjoying and disliking this game all at the same time. Maybe I am just a terrible detective but I havent been able to find one culprit yet. It's my fourth playthrough and I suppose Im still learning, and none of my LA Noir skills switch over to this one. To me this title has a lot of potential, it's unique, and a very good genre to delve into. But alas, clues feel more of hot/cold, rather than an actual clue, the murderer is always the same brand of murderer known as 'Anubis' so the procedurally generated world just makes me feel as if Im hoping for the one where all the clues will just be hot, hotter, hottest. It doesn't really feel as if I'm making real connections or anything of the sort. Oh and everytime there's a crime scene, there's nothing to investigate, it's just an empty version of said building. Kinda, well no more like, severly dissapointing. I got this title in a flash sale, so I say let thisgame age some more, before buying into it's tempting design. (Will come back to Edit)",

            "review_text": "My favourite thing about the game is the music, the composer sure knows how to write a jazz tune. The graphics are relatively simple but that just means you have to use your imagination, which isn't a bad thing in my opinion. I like the sense of progression you get from unlocking in game badges and the bonuses they give you as a result. Another bonus, you don't have to play as a nice P.I. or even bother to investigate at all and just shoot people and hope to get lucky. I haven't yet found the culprit this way but I'm still holding out hope for a lucky headshot to take him/her down. A gripe I have about the game is that if a NPC is on the same zone, hit box, area, etc., that you have to wait, only a few seconds, for them to move without wasting time talking to them. Besides that though I can't find a reason to not like this game.  There's also a sense of drama and suspense when you go to a part of town where there's also a hitman after you, especially if you don't know about it. One time I went to the Nightclub, there was a hitman with a person standing between us. The assassin and my character just faced eachother for what felt like minutes, he shot first but only by half a second. Joe or Peter or whatever that poor bystanders name was saved me from failure that run by taking the bullet meant for another.   Overall I would recommend if you like casual mystery games, especially if you're a fan of gritty P.I. themed things.",

People are dying, but the clues you can find are rather meaningless, and in the end you need to just guess who is the murderer, (and with as many suspects as there are, it is nearly impossible to correctly choose your suspect). The idea of there being a new 'mystery' every time is entirely laughable, since it takes place in the same town with what might as well be the same people. While I wouldn't mind this normally, they advertise it as one of their main selling points. On the postive side, the pixel graphics fit the noir style nicely. The music, (however basic is is), also helps set the tone.   Basically, in the end, what we have here is a game of 'Clue' or possibly even 'Mafia', just without any deduction or the fun of other people being there to enjoy it with you. I do not recommend it at full price, I'm simply glad that I got it on sale.",

The entire game is nothing more than incredibly drawn-out version of a single line of an incredibly easy sudoku puzzle, or a game of minesweeper on easy mode.  Every single mission amounts to repeating the same simple steps over and over, while praying to the RNG.  1. Go to social gatherings. Talk to everyone to fill up your suspect list, examine everything else for resources. Buy stuff if you're low on resoucres. (All of these actions can be done by basically holding down right+z) 2. Go to crime scenes and suspicious areas. Examine everything to fill up your clue list. 3. Cross-refence to see if the clue-list and suspect list match up with only one possible action. 4. Repeat until game is over, either through victory by getting the right information in time.  That is literally everything to the game. The rest of the mechanics are near worthless.  Starvation? Eating once gives you enough food to survive until the final day.  Factions? Literally just 'don't go to this area right now or you will die'.  Combat? If you need to use combat, you've already lost. It's basically impossible to recover from, and it causes your score to plummet so far that there's nearly no reason in continiung.  Story? Literally completely nonexistent. All character names are completely random, and every single killer has the motivation of 'I'm doing it for Anubis. Don't ask why.'  You don't get to examine bodies, you don't get to examine clues.  Here, you know what? I'll just give you the game for free, right here: Anything I list here is completely true (assuming the game doesn't glitch out and give the wrong information, as it does a lot, and there's nothing you can do but just eat the loss. And, yes, the developer has admitted that this is a glitch, not some really stupid 'feature'. Though, I wouldn't be surprised if it was added into the patch notes as a feature in later updates, considering how lazy this is- the developer made ZERO effort to hide the fact that it's a poorly-ported version of a cell phone game.)  Clue- Civilian or Mobster Clue- Civilian or Police Officer Clue- Dancer or Driver Clue- Dancer or Chef Clue- Male Suspect (Civilian)- Joe (Dancer) Suspect (Mobster)- Bill (Driver) Suspect (Police)- Bob (Chef) Suspect (Civilan)- Jessica (Artist)  Did you figure out that the killer was Joe? Good job! Now you don't need to waste your money on this garbage.",
