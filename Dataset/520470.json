            "review_text": "Glad I didn't try to save that $20 and purchased this game. I would rate this higher than Audioshield in terms of VR music game. Yes it's graphics are pretty simple, nothing flashy, and a bit hard to start, but I would treat this game as the VOS(if anyone know what that means to the music game genre) for VR MG.  First the greatest thing about this game is the judgement. A serious music game is not about you hit the note, but hit it precisely on the beat. That's the only way you can feel the rhythm of the music and start to enjoy the game. I'm a heavy Jubeat player and I found Music Inside's judgement (Also the score system) matches Jubeat - which is one of the best music games in history.  Still there is a ton lot of improvements can be made - which I hope the author doesn't just stop here. I'll skip the UI or graphics part as that's the easiest thing to make a change. Here is my wish list for the upcoming patches:  1. Animation for Great/Good/Bad, which helps you to find the right pace back.  2. Keynote sounds. That's a big disappointment that there is no keynote sound. This will improve the feedback further on top of the vibration. We can use different sounds too just like Reflecbeat. 3. Adjustable drum size. I feel the current one's a bit too small, also if we can adjust the space between the drums or even place them where we want would be great.  4. Most important - The option to play premade charts and a chart editor. The chat generation is brilliant, but given the depth of this game (10 drums and 2+2 switchable colors) it's chaotic at higher levels. I've played a lot of music games that generate charts instead of premade. It's OK at easier levels but when it comes to the top levels, random charts just make the game stupidly unplayable. You can still show the skill and how fast you can move but it defeats the purpose of 'playing' the music. Good Music + Well designed chart make songs epic.  5. I'm not sure what's the plan for the tuning switchs at the bottom side, but really wish to see some motion play around them.   Extremely highly recommended if you are a serious music game player. For casual players I would suggest try to ignore the rough graphics as the system mechanics of this game is best on the market for this genre so far.",
