            "review_text": "I just finished the game. If you like doing puzzle games and are also a fan of zombies, I would recommend this game. The puzzles get progressivly challenging- with the hardest having 350 pieces. The pieces float around in a river which makes for a little challenge of grabbing the ones you need. I got a little frustrated clicking over and over and picking up the piece that was either overlapping or under the piece I wanted. Many pieces got away from me, but I eventually caught them. The puzzles are nicely drawn and one thing I really liked was that each puzzle had different shaped pieces. One had different suits as on each side- spades, hearts, clubs, and diamonds. Another puzzle with a rapper zombie had words like SWAG as the edges of the pieces which made it interesting.   The zombie shooter aspect of the game is fun, but I didn't find it as challenging as I expected it to be. The zombies come out one by one until the Z timer runs out. Then multiple zombies run out, but at a rather slower than desired pace. I was able to pick most of them off before they even reached my barricade. Most run in a straight line or at a slight slope.   It would be nice to be able to change the difficulty level to up the zombie factor, either with more zombies, special zombies (currently, all zombies take 3 shots to kill), or zombies that run in zigzagging directions making them harder targets. I know the game is fairly new, so I'm looking forward to seeing what will be added to it. I'd also be interested in purchasing DLC puzzles. Lastly, Steam achievements would be the icing on the cake for this game.",

            "review_text": "I wasn't sure how this was going to work, coming off the Japan Pixel Puzzle game and its zen like peace and calm. This is a really clever concept, tying an action defense game in to a jigsaw puzzle mechanic, and I REALLY admire the concept - but its in total contrast to the other game in terms of tension, panic and ultimately frustration. I'll still play it, because of the novelty of it, and sometimes I like a buzz.   If you like being under pressure, and you have a quick keen eye for puzzle pieces you might like this incarnation. If you're a dawdler and a person who does jigsaws for relaxation I'd say this probably isnt the right title - go and play the Pixel Puzzles Japan game instead.",

            "review_text": "Barely recommended for the puzzle. No recommendation for the action game.  The action game doesn't add anything to the puzzling, other than distract you every now and then. For me it takes away the 'zen' experience of doing a puzzle and just adds some cheap action to it.  Also, the programmer seems to have never seen a timer. Seconds run from 60-1 and single digits don't have a leading 0. So you get times like 4:60 or 2:2. Not game breaking, of course, but looks stupid.  The puzzle game is not well done. Pieces on top won't be grabbed first. It almost seems random. You can't connect puzzles outside their final position. No bins to sort pieces into. Very basic.  Get it for cheap if you like some puzzling with comical zombie pictures.",

            "review_text": "Pixel Puzzles: UndeadZ is a jigsaw puzzle game with the distraction of fending off zombies. Instead of explaining what the heck a jigsaw puzzle is, I'm going to say what you need to know if you intend to play it right.  Play it with a big screen, and with a little more brightness than you find necessary. If your screen is smaller than 19', you're going to have a hard time with the size of the puzzle pieces in the later puzzles. Also, a lot of puzzles are dark, which becomes a pain in the butt when you are matching various colors of darkness.  You can turn off the distracting zombies when solving puzzles. The button to do so is to the right of the 'Go' button.  The menu mini game gives you infinite grenades, and can be thrown with the RMB. This is how you get those pain in the butt survival achievements.  To use power ups, such as the extra wall or the trip mine, you need to click and drag with the LMB to place them. If you don't place them, you still pay for them, even though they don't get used.  Expect each puzzle to take a long time (30min to +120min), and there is no 'save and quit' function to pause in the middle of a puzzle. You can pause the game with the ESC key, but make sure to plan your games in advance.  I do recommend it to those diehard puzzle game fans (like myself), but this game definitely isn't for everyone. If the game could be paused and saved for later, I would say it would be a casual game. Play it when you have a lot of time on your hands.",

            "review_text": "  I always loved jigsaw games, except that they'd often require an insane amount of physical space to work and that can always be a problem if you're living in an apartment. Either way, I've tried some titles before that one but I can't really say that I enjoyed them all that much, especially because they didn't really had a proper goal to achieve besides just selecting any option and assembling all the pieces. As for the 'Pixel Puzzle' series, they've introduced this new style with a simple storyline where you must solve the easier puzzles in order to advance to the harder ones. Another thing that they tried to come up with in this version is this mode where you must assemble everything as fast as possible in order to survive this zombie attack (which you can actually turn it off if you're just wanting to have some peaceful time). There's also this shooting zombies mini-game on the main menu (which should definitely have a pause button, come on guys, people gotta answer phone calls, take leaks etc). Some players might complain about the fact that the jigsaw parts keep floating all around the board and that when you try to grab one you accidentaly catch another. Either way, that's actually an interesting idea, I mean, I think that it's much better being that way rather than having to spread everything manually throughout the screen or taking the risk of one piece covering the other. The graphics are simple but ok, the soundtrack is quite redudant, so I've just turned the volume down while I was playing. The game also has achievements and trading cards, which is always awesome. Overall, I really liked this one (although I can't really say that I'm a zombie theme enthusiast) and I recommend it to the fans of the casual genre.",
