    "description": "National Zombie Park is a survival-roguelike game with procedurally generated world filled with zombies. Any second can become your last in this dangerous area. You always have to think twice before making another shot - bullets are extremely hard to find and the bang noises can attract even more zombies.",

            "review_text": "National Zombie Park promises a realistic survival roguelike experience in a world infested by zombies: you're thrown into a forested area with some loot nearby and asked to survive as long as possible with both zombies and the progressive infection (yes, you start infected) trying to kill you. What follows is a laggy, uninspired and ultimately quite dull romp in a barebones area while being chased by huge hordes of zombies that'll kill you in one hit.   PROS:   -none   CONS:   -unremarkable graphics still manage to create several framerate drops, how this can happen considering the top down perspective and how little is on screen is beyond me  -few sounds and they're all very weak: weapons sound tinny and zombie noises are pretty bad: there's also no music at all, not even on the main menu  -horrible animations, zombies just flail their arms awkwardly, reloads and melee bashes look very artificial  -awkward movement, you're not much faster than a zombie and can't sprint at all thus making escapes impossible  -no story whatsover, no goals, no leaderboards, nothing  -game world feels barren, just a few repeated tree models, some houses, fences, rare bunkers and that's all  -unfair loot spawn could leave you overflowing with batteries for your flashlight but with no antidote whatsoever thus forcing you to die and restart  -one hit kills coupled with bad framerate makes surviving a question of luck  -no way to edit keybinds unless you want to mess with the game files  -game only explains the controls, heck it doesn't even tell you that you're infected or how infection works  -you won't be surprised to know multiplayer is dead         National Zombie Park&nbsp;",
