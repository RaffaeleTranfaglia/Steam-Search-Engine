            "review_text": "I really enjoyed my playthrough of Vapour, for someone who likes a challenge and loves old school games, this game is enjoyable. Most of the old school elements were there, flooding rooms, boulder runs, switch puzzles, as well as the old memory / tune puzzle (Much like Fallout 3's musical tune puzzle). The enemies are variable and quite a challenge to boot, my favorite battle was the first witch, while it might of been a glitch ,she spawned while the room was flooding forcing me to use the extra rooms to replenish my mana and health and then haveing to scamble to solve the puzzle before I drown after killing her, quite a challenge indeed. I loved the use of secret mana and health pick-ups, quite a nessecity to enable you to defeat some of those irratable wraiths. I was surprised when I reached the end of the game and could not reach the last room because some relics were off the path, a pleasant surprise to have to backtrack to find some secrets you missed. I quit this game twice, as in to the desktop and five minutes later found myself swearing and trudging through the puzzles again convinced that it was possible to beat that irratable wraith, even if he can drift through objects and screw you over almost instantly, if you have decided to replenish at the wrong time. Anyway I really liked the game and for a very small indie development team for their first game not a bad game at all, anyone who has the time, patients and persistence to finish this game will be rewarded with nestalgia of the old school games and when the gameplay made the game and not the story.Not to mention I played this game in one sitdown from 9pm - 5am, 8 hours of enjoyable and challenging fun.",

            "review_text": "In short: Avoid it like the plague  The rest: Most of my playtime with this game was spent wandering around aimlessly. I jumped almost all through the level until finding what I needed to find and all sorts of items start popping up in places I'd already been.   The three enemy types encountered either were annoying, flying heads or headspiders. Or somesort of hellknight that distorted my screen when hit and as it's attack. An attack which seemed to be a one hit kill after I hit the damn thing with between six or seven lightningbolts.  Bugs are a plenty in this mess, and janking up the scenery seems to be a substitute for gameplay. Think Skyrim but without the fun of watching a horse do it. The screen was tearing all over the place even with Vsync up to max. For some reason the resoultion kept getting set down to 640x860 automatically in the ingame menu. I still have no way of knowing what resolution the game was actually running in. The launcher said one thing, ingame said another. When I set the Vsync on the graphics went from Fantastic to Beautiful, couldn't set it back.",
