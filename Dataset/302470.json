            "review_text": "I've just played through the campaign and I'm obliged to write a meaningful review now.  First I'll tell a little about the game. The best way to describe this is a Total War-Warcraft-Heroes of Might and Magic mix, where you can't control towns, but only buy troops from them and carry out quests. Something very similar is perhaps Praetorians. Every troop (units are broken into troops, you can't control soldiers individually) gains its own experience and can be upgraded in a town when it reaches every 3 levels. Monster dens are scattered around every map (the campaign is broken into maps) specificially for grinding experience, money and items, which can be equipped on units. The most powerful units are perhaps battle mages - you can control them individually, they have multiple useful spells to cast and they fire destructive area-damaging spells like they're semi-automatic artillery or something. Though it takes long to grind XP to upgrade them to the maximum level. The player's main character is presented as a spirit flying in the air in front of the camera. He can't participate in the battle directly. He gains XP along with the player's army and just hurls spells. Here are controls for the camera: WASD or arrow keys or move the cursor to the edge of the screen - to move the camera. Hold ctrl+WASD or arrow keys - rotate the view. This actually gives the impression of first-person view. You can pause with Space, and you can't move the camera while paused, but you can still rotate. Right-clicking on a troop instantly brings the camera to it, even when paused.  I noticed that the mana does not play any role. It's never spent when I cast spells. Nothing ever happens when mana becomes 0. I'm allowed to cast spells which cost more mana than I have at max. So leveling the mana skill is a waste of XP.  Units sometimes get stuck on cornerns of the terrain. It doesn't happen too often, it can be fixed by manually moving the unit to the other side. But it is damn annoying.  Music suddenly interrupts all the time and only resumes playing when a battle starts. There's a volume slider in game options, but no checkbox to switch music on/off so that you could restart it.  You will not be able to play this game on normal speed, because in that case it is too boring. The speed can be regulated with (+) and (-) keys on the number pad of the keyboard. I couldn't find this option anywhere in the game settings or explained anywhere, so I'm writing it.  Not a single crash has occured. Brilliant.  Now, the actual review. First off, the tutorial doesn't cover 90% of gameplay, you have to figure it out on your own. Difficulty of that depends on how many RTS games you've played.  The kind of mage you choose before the start of the campaign only affects the starting skills and spells you get. And the avatar icon, yes. Everything else is the same.  The campaign is extremely, punishingly difficult at the beginning and becomes too easy starting somewhere from the middle of it. Saving often is adviced, because suddenly you might lose a battle mage, which is too valuable. Using multiple save files is adviced, because sometimes you can get unexpectedly cornered by overwhelming enemy troops, who were just passing by and you happened to make company with them.  The quests are completely uninspired: go there, talk to that person (you can't even choose replies in dialogue), bring that item over there, escort a slow-♥♥♥ wagon from point A to point B. And completely nothing happens while you escort a thing or go from A to B. Nothing. At all. And the wagon is sloooooow.... Seriously, most part of the game is walking around the map. You can tell your army to move somewhere and go away from the keyboard for 3-4 minutes. On maximum game speed.  The voice acting is really good, although that wolf howl is a pain for the ears, and some voices (goblin's) are not so great.  The cutscenes are something like in Warcraft 3, except really poorly done (I mean it, year 2003 is in no way an excuse for this) - you can tell it even by how the camera is flying around. Very often it's showing a single place and flying around it for 40 seconds, and nothing happens. Absolutely nothing happens. The characters are just standing, playing their completely out-of-place idle animations, and the camera is rolling around and ugh... No words can explain this.  The graphics don't seem to be designed to look good, even for 2003, except for a few models and unit and special effects animations. The faces of the elves are especially ugly, but maybe they're supposed to be? The map models are incredibly plain - just textured ground (thanks God, not plain ground - it contains hills, bumps and stuff). Occasional trees and rocks and buildings, but in limited quantities. It does manage to set the mood, though.  The plot.. Um. I can't say I'm disappointed, because somehow it seems fitting for a fantasy-themed game, but let me explain. It is all fairy-tale cliche mostly. The missions are brutally straight-forward: we need to do something in order to achieve something, in the process we learn new information and get new tasks to do. The plot does get confusing in the middle and in the end, when seemingly random names of mages of the Guild of Mages are mentioned. Near the end it hardly makes sense even. The only things that can be interesting about it is how new information about what's going on is revealed to the player (although it may appear kind of stupid..and random). The most exciting things are perhaps intermission cutscenes, they are really well done. They contain drawn black-and-white images, with amazing voice-over (sadly, without subtitles, but you probably won't need them). It looks beautiful.  The core combat mechanics, combined with RPG elements, spell-casting and rock-scissors-paper tactics, give an exciting mix. The game is not boring during battles and you may really want to slow the game speed down (unless you're grinding on monster mobs) and get to microing your ranged units away from melee attackers. The battles are the main part of the game, and it turned out although not perfectly, but still incredibly satisfying.  I recommend this game only to those who enjoy RTS, grinding and leveling, and who have enough patience to bear the plot, old graphics, generally slow pace and bugs.",
