Nearly every single object in this game can be talked to, interacted with, and looked at all with humrous consequence; the game chiding your every stupid move. Not to say that this makes it a good game, but it's one of the many clear indications that the developer put a lot of time into the title and didn't want to make any action you could possibly do feel simple or redundant.  Not just an adventure game, it's also a straight up Western RPG. The NPCs are deep and the fighting mechanics are simple yet refined. Given that I haven't played any other point and click rpgs in my life, (such as the Hero's quest series that the game is based off of) I don't know how it compares; but I've enjoyed what I've seen so far.",

This game is lovingly created to honor these old games, and to create an all new journey and world for us to play. I absolutely adored this game. It had me laughing and grinning all the way through at the jokes, the easter eggs, and just plain good fun that this game was made with. I recommend it to anyone who ever wanted another one of those old adventure games, or anyone who just loves a good puzzle game. There is a lot of replayability as you can solve the puzzles in many different ways depending on what you do and what class you play. There is just so much to enjoy in this game that I could go on for hours, and I have to my own friends.   Two thumbs way up and I rather hope they create a sequel so I can play more in this world.",

            "review_text": "Wonderful love letter to the Quest for Glory series, and 100% FREE to boot. I was an old member of the Hero6 scene back in the day and remember the first screenshots of this game. Wonderful to see it finally released years later.  Great things: + Old Norse setting really adds to the game, with appearances by Loki, the valkyries, Sigurd, frost giants and tons of lore that will make you want to read up on viking mythology. + RPG stats really do matter, much more so than they did in the Quest for Glory games.  + Combat system is fairly deep in the spirit of Quest for Glory 2; true, eventually you get strong enough to just click your way through most battles but each enemy has certain 'tells' that you need to watch out for and dodging attacks takes practice. There are also many more enemies than I expected. + TONS of sidequests, and many are optional. Rogues, since they can steal stuff, actually have the option to bypass what feels like 80% of the side stuff in this game, making the replay value really substantial. + For a free AGS game, Heroine's Quest feels remarkably 'alive', more so than some commercial releases. All of the characters have their own schedules and say different things when they're in the presence of different people. Some might find this annoying, since it can be hard to find a character during a certain time of day unless you know their schedule down to the hour, but I felt it added a lot of life to the adventuring experience.  Not as great things: + Main character is bland. I realize she's a blank slate like the hero in Quest for Glory (who was also bland but at least silent), but since the devs made the decision to make her talk, I felt they could have added more spice to her dialogue. She could have been as memorable as Roehm from Quest for Infamy. + I know quest logs aren't a traditional feature of adventure games, but this game could have benefitted from one since there are just so many side quests to keep track of. + Sometimes things veer into infamous 'adventure game logic'. Occasionally items that can be picked up are not obvious on screen and certain puzzle solutions seem illogical. I used the official walkthrough more than I would've liked and certainly would not have guessed that Rogues need to escape the blizzard with Heime by combining a certain two items. + Speaking of Rogues, it's REALLY easy to get caught by guards when thieving in this game. A few warning messages like 'That was a close call! You really shouldn't try robbing that house again.' or 'Do you REALLY want to pick his pocket?' might have been appreciated.   Neutral: + The food/rest/freezing mechanic definitely won't be liked by all! At the start of the game it's so hard to pass out from the cold...this really makes the first few in-game days tough since you're constantly retreating back to town for warmth and worrying about food. I didn't mind this, since it really makes you feel like a badass at the end when you're just running through the forest with your stamina barely dropping. But I also 'cheated' a few times by dropping the difficulty to zero when I was in danger of freezing/starving, lol...  Anyway, nitpicks aside - a lovely game! This came out the same time as Quest for Infamy, so I know a lot of people are wondering which of the two are better. Well, this one's FREE, and you can't beat that, but they're both good. In the end, Quest for Infamy is funnier and has a slightly more epic scope, but Heroine's Quest provides a tighter experience with better RPG mechanics and lore. Play both if you're an old school QFG fan.",

It is hugely addictive. When I first played this game, I also had three other games going. After I hit 'new game' on Heroine's Quest, the other three games pretty much just languished in the dust pile 3. You can play as Warrior, Mage, or Rogue. Each with different puzzles and pathways to progress the game. This means high replayability 4. Likeable heroine and NPCs. Voice acting was top-notch 5. Doom Squirrel. This game has THE DOOM SQUIRREL. Kneel in awe to the SQUIRREL OF DOOM.",

            "review_text": "Lets see... where do i begin? Well for starters, i actually assumed this game was made in the 90s because of its retro feel. It was made fairly recently, in 2013.That's actually one of my favorite aspects of the game. It's simple, easy to follow and contains an excellent soundtrack! The story's compelling enough to make you want to play this game again. The game offers plenty of variety in terms of customization! Another plus to the game is that there is a female protagonist in the game (hense the name Heroines Quest) and the character does not look promiscuous! Voice acting is excellent and it shows the developers dedicated themselves to making such a wonderfully simple RPG. The game also contains a wonderful soundtrack! The only dislike I have is that is there is not an opportunity to explore the other worlds/realms in this game. in chapter 2 where the norns ask of your destination(which is Svartelfeim), if you select any other world besides Svartelfeim (along with answering questions about what you seek and who told you to do so), your character gets sent to the void and you lose the game. Also, in the begining of the game there is a quest which involves another realm, but you do not get a chance to also do that quest. Overall a wonderful game to play, and I would definately recommend it! =)",

Note: * There are some people giving negative reviews because the frostbite is hard... turns out if you don't like that, you can turn it off in the settings.

It doesn't feel as dated as it might have if they hadn't made any of the tweaks they did.  Having it be a Heroine just adds substantially to my enjoyment of this game. It's not often I get to actually play as my gender in a game that acknowledges it freely in its dialogue.  The voice acting is ridiculously good. Quest for Glory IV, back in 1994, had some of the very best voice acting you will ever hear in a video game, and this game is right up there with it. Compared to the wooden, monotone voice acting you get in so many other video games, it's such a treat.  This is a blast from my past and yet brand new to me, and it's all I ever wanted in a game. I only wish two things of it: that you could have romanced a female character (because yay girl love!) and that there was a sequel available I could play too.",

There are usually several options you can choose to solve a particular problem, depending on your class. The story is good, revolving around Norse mythology, and everything was beautifully drawn.  I usually never get around to finishing most games, but this one I just couldn't leave until I managed to fnish it. It's leagues above most -paid- games in its genre I've tried. Definitely recommended.",

There are 3 variations to your character (warrior, sorceress, rogue) which allows you to tackle obstacles and puzzles within the spectrum of full blooded violence to subtle subterfuge, providing lots of gameplay differences and replayability.   You can tell a lot of dedication, hard work, and love went into this at every stage of the game. Highly recommended for any adventure or RPG fans.",

I have played about 5 hours into it and don't know if I'll continue. It's not a bad game at all, but it definitly doesn't live up to it's namesake. Where Quest for Glory games basically let you roam free and figure the world out for yourself, this game constantly holds your hand and tells you what to do 'next'. There is even a mechanic to actively discourage you from exploration. Where Quest for Glory was your story, this game is set on telling its own story and forces you to take part in it. That's not the Heros Quest I remember.  After reading so many reviews raving about this game, I can't help but be a little annoyed. The voice acting is ok, but the dialog feels like it's never going to end at times. The music is not horrible, but I've actually read reviews saying it was as fitting as QFG music. That is especially ridiculous and painful to read.   I just felt I had to say something as even though this may be a nicely made game, it is a pale shadow of the Quest for Glory series and does not deserve the loftly praise of being on par with it.",
