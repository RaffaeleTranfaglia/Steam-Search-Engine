            "review_text": "Bear in mind that this is a relative reccomendation... (I understand i dont have much time in this game. but since i bought it life happened)   Its a real simulator (or at least as close as they could get without overcomplicating). That alone should give you some indication of how much enjoyment you will get out of it. If you like simulators then we are off to a good start.  This is in no way a graphically gorgeous game its a simple interface with symbols and lines representing different things. on the map. And text that gives you info you need to know as sidebars. If you are okay with that, then thats another check on your checklist.  The UI is both simple and complicated. It provides you with what you need but at the same time that can seem daunting. You have a decent amount of info in front of you. The way you interact with the game is through clicking on aircraft and giving commands through a simple interface. I do however recommend getting to know some of the hotkeys (found in the manual) Which leads me to the next point.  This is not a game you will just be able to sit down and play like a pro straight away. You  will  crash aircraft. You  will  Pull your hair out at points wondering, shouting 'what do i do? What is going on?'. This game has a steep learning curve. It does provide a tutorial, or rather tutorials. But they will still leave you with questions. But my dear ATC prospects there is a tip i can provide you...  Get the manual and print it off (its not too big). Have it next to you for a few games and refer to it often until you feel comfortable. And unless you are fast with a mouse, hotkeys are your friends.  With all that said, would i recommend this game to anyone? Simple answer is no. Thats a no to anyone who just does not have the patience for micromanaging a lot of things at once. A no to anyone with little or no interest in aviation and ATC.  This is one of those simulators that was not built with the casual gamer in mind (even though it can try to pass itself off like that at times)  If however you are interested in aviation and ATC or you are someone who likes (serious) simulators. I would recommend it. It is definitely a niche game. But can be very satisfying.   My own personal let down was a lack of being able to verbally command aircraft. Other than that i enjoyed what i played so far.  The best point that can be made for this game, from my own experience looking for an ATC sim in the past, is this is a bargain for someone who may be an enthusiast. But has no need to buy a three figure sum simulator (that was a mouthful. Try saying that after a few drinks) meant for people who know thats the career they wish to follow and need in depth training.  That is not to say this game is shallow. rather it just means that it provides an enjoyable ATC experience without bogging you down too much.   I hope this helps anyone out there. And if you are looking at this at all something about this must have piqued your interest.",
