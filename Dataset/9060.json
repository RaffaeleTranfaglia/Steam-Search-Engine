            "review_text": "I played this game a lot when it came out. I must say it was a hit back then and I was rooted to my 15-inch monitor salivating profusely to the awesomness this game offered. Lush, colorful graphics, great gameplay, cool puzzles and unique weaponry made this game my favourite entertainment of 1998. Then by some terrible accident I stomped on my CD with copy of this game and didn't finished it.   So 14 years later I spottted this game on steam an thought I would give it another try,   It didn't age well. If You think about all possible nightmares of retro gaming this one has it all. Hard as hell and unforgiving in a wrong way. I can still play first Quake/Doom/DN3D without feeling cheated but this game seems to be very imbalanced. It is known for it's notorious puzzles which are very frustrating and irritating. Opponents feels sometimes awfully overpowered, especially bosses. Colors and overall graphic design seems bleak and desolate which might be intentional back then but today it just feels empty and unappealing. Apart from that overall perfomance seems to be quite choppy on lower resolutions (the way it meant ot be played by the way). If You boost the resolution up with unofficial mods it works fine but levels looks very simple and raw because texture show their age. You may think that I might be spoiled with recent AAA titles but for me it's just not that fun to play anymore.   I still kinda like it for nostalgia reasons but I just can't recommend it anymore.",

            "review_text": "NOTE: I played the game using the 'Hammer of Thyrion' project, available online. It fixes several issues and adds a plethora of features the vanilla game lacks.  Much like the previous HeXen game, Hexen II is an enjoyable RPG-FPS hybrid, this time upgraded from the Doom engine to the Quake engine.  Played on the second hardest difficulty as the Assassin. I can certainly say I had to fight tooth and nail to survive almost every single encounter in the first half of the game. However, the biggest obstacles in the game were its immense quantity of puzzles that you had to solve in order to unlock other areas and proceed forward. While the combat was fun, the sheer amount of back-and-forth with items, switches and other things was occasionally a bit overwhelming.  I loved the concept of being able to level up your character, but unfortunately, it plays a very shallow part in the overall game, barely affecting anything except your max HP. If it had been more fleshed out, it could have been significantly better.  I kept getting lost in levels (admittedly due to not paying enough attention sometimes) and felt that a lot of the areas looked very samey, which greatly increased the difficulty in backtracking to the actual spot you need to be in next. I can't blame the game for this in its entirety, but it could have used a bit less labyrinthine level design.  Two large problems arose during my time with the game, one being that in the first world has a glitch that can potentially softlock you, forcing you to reload an older save, cheat or just restart the entire game over. If you want to avoid this, just look up info about the   Shovel and the Treasury Key  . The second problem was the final boss taking way too long to beat. I kept peppering it with everything for upwards of 15 minutes before it finally went down.  In conclusion, though it has some issues, the game is still good, but it will ask for more puzzle skills than you might expect from a game of this type. I would gladly buy and play the expansion pack, were it made available on Steam.",
