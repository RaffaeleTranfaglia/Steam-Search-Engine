            "review_text": "If you're looking for a farming/dating/life sim you're better off just investing in one of the many many MANY Harvest Moon or Rune Factory games. You'll get better game play, more interesting characters/story and a more rewarding experience. However, if you want a simpler, bare bones Harvest Moon-esque experience, I'd reccomend this game. It pretty much IS Harvest Moon, only much less in depth and with faster progression. It's fine, it's just nothing special and at times feels a bit hollow.  Pros:  Fast progression, it's easy to accomplish a lot in just a few hours of game play.   A decently vast world that adds a bit of exploration to the game  Cons:  While the bachelorettes each have a few character traits to make them each unique, there is no way to build relationships with the other NPCs. The bacheloretes frequently have moments that completely kill any charm they had and suck the fun out of courting them. It's also hard to tell when they actually like a gift or not, since there are no facial expressions and their dialogue can be very odd and unclear. 'This is nice. Thanks.' could be taken as earnest, or forced and polite, or sarcastic or passive aggressive. 'WOW! I love you ten percent more now!' Awesome, I'm not only dating a robot, I'm dating a very shallow robot.   There are lots of little things about the game, from the map layout to the menu interface (particularly the inventory system) that are inconveinient and frankly tested my patience. It's the sort of thing where the game isn't taking more time to complete because of a challenge, but because the inventory system is a pain in the ♥♥♥.   A lot of aspects of the game become completely pointless further down the road because you'll run out of things to buy and you're just killing time until you can win the love of your chosen lady, marry her and 'win.'

I was convinced it would be a disapointment, especially for how cheap the game it. But I was plesantly surprised! This game is such a fun light hearted game, I would highly recommed it for anyone who enjoys the harvest moon series. There isn't as much game play as the harvest moon series but for how cheap it is how cares! Its a great game!",

I've been liking it quite a bit so far. The map is surprisingly big, the variety of tasks (farming, beekeeping, mining, fishing, etc) is good, etc. Good little game, especially for the price. :)",
