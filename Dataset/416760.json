Surely not a $60 game, however it is a steal at it's current sale price of $3.99.",

            "review_text": "So its not common that i write reviews at all. But i do so when i find a game that has an interesting or fun experience. This is not really a funny game but its more of a game that teaches you how big companies are forcing you to buy in game currency for certain things. I know my self i have many times found a fun looking game that i would like to continue in but ive always stopped myself when all those P2W comes up. Sadly but true almost every game has some P2W content. Not that extreme that you HAVE to spend but it would surely make it more easy and enyojable. Mainly i play League of Legends. You can earn yourself all the characters in the game OR you could buy them with in game currency that cost real money ofcourse. But ive never stopped playing LoL because of that. I mean the developers need to earn money in some way and i can understand that. But now when it comes to the part that i cant continue playing if i dont pay. Thats just terrible. I will talk about this game now and how i felt like playing it.  + Pros +Teaches us in a really good way how big companies uses different bussiness models to 'force' us into buying virtual currency. + The game is fun in some parts. + Got some okay soundtrack but gets tiresome. (Its like 2 different songs)  - Cons - Could really get annoying and boring sometimes. The feeling when your doing the same thing over and over again was really not that great. - The developer could have made it that way so it was more fun and enjoyable to play AND we could learn at the same time. I would have loved the game so more. - Really NOT replayable. Just no. The game itself its pretty boring and i see no meaning of replaying it.  I would recommend most people to try this out. You could think for yourself, what am i putting my money on and is it really worth it? I have spent SO MUCH on my favourite games out there you guys dont even know. But as a gamer in my heart it was all worth it. // He-_-Pole",
