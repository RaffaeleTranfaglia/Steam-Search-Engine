            "review_text": "  The full (German) review can be found on my  blog  [www.jack-reviews.com]   The Warlock of Firetop Mountain is another Fighting Fantasy adaptation from Tin Man Games. It has more in common with Inkle's Sorcery! than with their previous work, however. Instead of reading a digital book, you're actually playing a kind of tabletop game. And in that regard, it leaves Sorcery! in the dust, as the presentation is far superior.  It does not offer the same amount of content, though. Sure, you have 16+ heroes (of which 8 were available prior to release) with different goals and abilities, but that doesn't mean the game changes massively. And once you know what to do, a single playthrough takes maybe an hour. Still took me six to actually finish the game, even when using all three resurrection stones the game offers per playthrough.  One reason is the most annoying aspect of these gamebooks: instant death traps. Be a bit too nosy and your character might easily end up dead. Throwing a dice to test one's luck would easily have alleviated that problem.  Another problem is the damn maze every player has to cross (unless, perhaps, they manage to amass enough gold to buy the Maze Jumper, which I never achieved). Since it's randomly generated, you never know which rooms are safe. And those that aren't contain annoying hand creatures that you can try to flee from, but it won't work every time. And if it doesn't, you take a few points of damage and still have to fight ... which my earlier heroes never survived. The only other option is to fight them outright, which might not end much better.  And then there's the second floor. Really easy if you know what you're doing ... but if your hero has for some reason exhausted all his luck, he can easily lose his life if a certain room gets in his way. I had to cross it four times the first time I got there, which brought me to the brink of death. So of course I didn't survive what little came after the maze.  One of the devs commented that the maze has been made a little fairer, though. So it might not be as annoying anymore.  But hey, contrary to Sorcery!, it actually offers an interesting battle system. It's based on a grid where both the heroes and the enemies move at the same time, which means that attacking an empty square can sometimes be more advantageous than going toe to toe (where the dice would decide the outcome).  Every hero has different skills to offer. Some can attack multiple squares around themselves, others can bind the enemies in place or stop them from attacking ... if you manage to hit them, of course. Sometimes their pattern is quite obvious. Or even stupid, like that of an ogre who simply turned and turned, never striking me once (which has sadly been changed, it seems :x). Other enemies are far more annoying, especially if they can guard against your attack, which you might never know unless you try.  That's why I'd personally recommend choosing a hero who can strike from afar. Makes it easier to survive more difficult battles. And if you don't, you'll respawn at the last bench you rested at. If you still have a resurrection stone, that is.  And if you simply can't proceed, there's always the option of using the Free Read Mode. I wouldn't recommend it for the first few times, though, as every battle can be skipped, no souls can be gathered, and achievements can apparently not be triggered.  All things considered, I'd call The Warlock of Firetop Mountain a well done adaptation. But it shares some flaws with the original (or so I would assume, as I have never read it). And it simply doesn't offer the same amount of content you would find in Sorcery!",

            "review_text": "Very well done. Very well executed software, not the incomplete feeling games you often get from kickstarters and indy games. I never read the original gamebook but I did have some other Steve Jackson games as a kid and my kids love his Munchkin game. I have actually been playing this with my youngest daughter as our reading time. I read her the story, she chooses what happens. It's a lot of fun seeing her think about her choices and see the rewards/consequences. Definitely worth the price of admission.",

            "review_text": "I've been craving a game that has: -Short sessions (between having a 2 year old and a job in TV/Film Post Production, this is a necessity) -Not-to-complex RPG elements (to fill the gap between D&amp;D 5e sessions) -Easy to pick up gameplay (never know when time is available, so don't want to relearn a system or recall 20-40 hours of previous gameplay in order to play. There's other games for that.)  ...and this game certainly helped with that. I have little experience with the original material, so this wasn't nostalgia for me. Instead, it was a light, fun game that I could dip into the mind of a character for 1-2 hours (lifespan dependent, of course) without also investing heavily into a BG/IWD-style system. The game really made me think about what to do, from a logical as well as ethical POV (I stared at the last choice for a minute or two before deciding. Felt like the end of Fable all over again). It helps when you really take the RP portion to heart and play the character as they were built. Everyone has their go-to character type (for me, magic casters and archers all the way), but it is fun to dip into other character types and builds to explore options you may not usually embrace. The short sessions you would have with these characters allows you to do that without investing SO much into them, taking away the fear of creating a character you are now stuck with and don't enjoy. Pick someone up, run with it, and on your next run through, choose someone else. Go N instead of S. Poke that goblin with a dagger instead of chatting him up. Mix it up: that's the fun of it. Hey, maybe you'll even find that instead of pew pewing magic missiles, you like smacking orcs around with a two-handed axe. You never know until you rage.  A minor suggestion and bug to note (not game breaking at ALL, just things that came up) -In areas like the mazes, the time spent panning between screens and waiting for the menus to pop up became a little tedious. I got through them, obviously, but a Quick Skip button (similar to P&amp;C Adventure Games with double-clicking to room warp, essentially) would be a nice touch. Especially if it is something like your 10th run through, or your third restoration. -Upon beating the game (1st run through, surprisingly, though I'll admit I was sapped of restoration stones and in the single digits for health...keeps you on your toes, that's for sure), I went to buy Krea. However, clicking the buy button seemed to only reset the text box and that's all. If anyone else has this issue, exit the game completely and pop back in. This fixed it as if nothing happened in the first place.  NOTE: If you end up doing what I did and BEAT the game in the first run, it'll take you about 1-2 hours. If that would be it for you, $20 is a bit much. However, I believe the game can have quite a bit of replayability due to the different characters and their styles of play. If you consider running each character through the game with NEVER failing the game (excluding coming soon characters), thats's 12-24 hours worth of gameplay. But you'll probably die, so jack that up and the $20 is all the more worth it.  If you read this review and it spoke to you saying 'hey, me, I like the sound of that,' good luck, have fun, and enjoy some solo D&amp;D between your sessions.",

            "review_text": "  For the most part I would say that I have enjoyed my time with The Warlock of Firetop Mountain.   The majority of The Warlock of Firetop Mountain involves reading text and making a choice on how you would like to proceed. I really enjoyed this part of the game and it reminds me a lot of the Sorcery series of games. If you like tabletop RPG games that focus heavily on the story I think you will really enjoy this part of the game.   I also think the combat is well done. The combat is pretty simple which mostly involves moving around the grid based board avoiding and attacking enemies. The system works well and it is satisfying when you learn the enemy attack patterns so you can avoid taking damage. Some of the enemies are pretty stupid though and don't provide much of a challenge.  There is actually only one thing that I didn't really like about the game. Warlock of Firetop Mountain is a rogue-like game in that if you die you lose all of your progress and have to start from the beginning. I have never been a big fan of rogue-like games so this probably bothers me more than it will people that like rogue-like games. The problem is that the game appears to only have slight randomization and most of the elements you encounter are exactly the same each time you encounter them. This means that each time you die you will have to repeat a lot of content to make it back to the point where you died last. I just wish the game could have avoided some of the repetition. If that doesn't really bother you this won't be much of an issue for you.  If you like these type of story driven tabletop role playing style games, I think you will really enjoy The Warlock of Firetop Mountain.
