The True End is very easy to get, you don't need to look a guide to get it.  If you want to spend some time with a fun and cheap game with a cool horros story you might want to buy this game (or maybe wait for a steam sale and buy it more cheap). You will not regreat about it.",

Might not be on the level of NitroPlus, but I enjoyed it, and think it's a good example of what Ren'py can do, if you wanted to make an hour long visual novel. The true ending was cute, and glad I bought it.   My only disappointment is how my favorite Youtubers who played the game as well, didn't like it. Although I often find myself disagreeing with their Let's Plays of visual novels anyway, but still. Not sure if the epilogue was a teaser to a sequel, or simply just a joke, but if the creator ever comes out with more games, I'll happily support it.",

            "review_text": "BAD END, is a realy nice VN, it is smewhat short, but $1.98 is a good price for this game esp. since you can get a god 7 through 12 hours out of this game esp. if you are aiming to get all the endings/aichevments without any help or guides which I did for the most part, except for the 1 or 2 I tried really hard to get, but just couldn't seem to get. Basically I think it is a pretty decent little VN, &amp; there are people that complain that is not Horror, but there is even a dialogue in the game where thr character you are playing is playing BAD END, &amp; says it is more like an adventure, mystery, survivalistic game, what I'm trying to say is that a lot of people complain that this VN isn't a horror, even though if they actually played the VN they would get it wasn't really meant to be a horror VN, &amp; I don't think people should not try to give this game a try, just because it's not 'horror'. Also another complaint for this game is your choices don't matter, you will just die no matter what, which yes, is true for the BAD ENDS, since that is kind of their point, however your choices do matter &amp; you have to do stuff a cerain way to get the other type of ending, &amp; even the bad endings you have to make choices in a certain way to get that specific bad ending, the same for regular endings. &amp; while it is true the story is somewhat cliche, it is still a nice little story well worth the $1.98.  Graphics/art style: 8.5/10, it has really nice art with some good CGs Story: 6.5 or 7/10, a nice little story with likable characters, where I actually felt sad for them, &amp; felt sad for their deaths Choice system: 5.5/10, the choices do matter &amp; there is a lot of them, &amp; you do get new dialogues &amp; scenes but not much branching a very linear story, which is fine, since it is still a good VN.  A highly suggest this VN, I hope you enjoy it as I did.",

For the price of the VN is not bad at all. The VN is short as expected for the price. I did spend four hours on this VN. I think because I was playing this while tired my brain wasn't working right even while using the guide to get the achievements. So yes the achievements shouldn't be hard to get.   The BG for some reason was blurry for me while playing. But the sprites were of higher quality. The music was alright. Also for a $2 the story wasn't bad in my opinion. Just don't go expecting a big story and u will have fun playing this VN.  The only negative thing about this VN in my opinion was it was short. If the game was longer then I believe the VN would of been even more amazing.   All in all if u want to kill a few hours for $2 this VN shouldn't be passed up.",

I expected to at least see some unusual death scenes but every bad end is basically the same scene of the character getting grabbed by a shadowy figure, or a ghost hand coming out of their phone screen. This would be okay if the story was at least good, however it's just mundane and repetitive. There's nothing interesting about this visual novel.",

            "review_text": "Just Finished Playing the Game and receiving all the endings. I am very familiar with Visual Novels from Japan and I have played alot of them.  This one in particular is just a port from Android/iOS Phones for Steam. I later realized this. However, The price point is set very well about how much this game is worth  It is pretty short, took me about 3 hours to get ALL endings, 1 hour for one playthrough to True End. So its better to get this on your phone and play it spurratically IMHO.  -I Purchased this game because I am a huge fan of Survival Horror type games where the Protagonist is mutilated in a variety of interesting ways. This was rather lacking to what I'm used to.   All the Bad Endings are mostly the same with little difference in what happens. Very Unoriginal Bad Endings    For a game called BAD END, only the True end makes the game make sense lol -The BGM (Background Music) was very distracting in key scenes which were supposed to be scary with 'Happy Tones'. So calling this 'Survival Horror' is kinda a joke. -There were very few Unique CGS, but considering the length of the game, understandable. -The plot   breaking the 4th wall and back again was entertaining at first, but was dragged on and on throughout the game.   Personally I have enjoyed stories from Amatuer Visual Novelists better than this, but it was an okay way to spend an hour of life. -Best part of the game is the funny posts you can see in the Discussion community after you play  I recommend you play other Visual Novels instead, use  vndb.org  to find the genre you like best. Steam isn't really the best port for these types of games yet, but the 16:9 / Fullscreen Aspect Ratio was appreciated (Although you would get the same thing on your phone)  If you really want to get this game, it is entertaining for about an hour or so, and I would get it on iOS/Android because of conveinence. Also it IS made to be a mobile game.",
