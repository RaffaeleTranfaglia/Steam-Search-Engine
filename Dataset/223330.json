Let`s go down the list: 1) Great, and realistic sea combat - you can use different types of ammo to deal damage (bombs can begin fire, shrapnel will tear crew apart ) 2) Ground combat mechanics are unique - it`s challenging at first, but when you get used to it, you will ask yourself 'Why nobody did this before?' 3) Great role-playing system - It`s got character stats, character perks and ship perks 4) ALOT of micromanagement! 5) Awesome quests, great characters, great artstyle 6) Massive open-world And a lot more! And finally devs made english translation! (It took pretty long time)",

CONS: -Graphics are old  -Land fighting mechanics are clunky and outdated although have considerable depth to choice of weapons which could be used. -The quests are buggy -Sea battle AI is weak -Many crashes, thus save often.  PROS: -Very immersive sea battles (there is a setting to make them realistic or arcady). -In depth ship sailing characteristics, although could be made more realistic for more immersion. -Dynamic trade system. Hard at first but gets very profitable eventually. -Free world with unlimited generated side quests with hero reputation system. -Crew and world interaction based on the reputation system. -The game doesn't hold your hand thus quite challenging. New players should play on normal difficulty.  I definitely recommend it!",

            "review_text": "I.... love these game series... but at the same time I feel frustrated by the ammount of problems these games have.   SD: TEHO - In my opinion it feels like an improvement from previous games like AoP2 and PotC. But it still have some bugs that ruin the experience for example. In this game it is essential that you save and load a lot, but whats the point if your save file is gonna get corrupt for saving in the same place? I'm a person that likes to have only one savegame but I have to be saving on diferent places and it feels like a mess to me.   I liked the tutorial to be honest, and the story so far, the music, the improved enviroments, ships, options, alchemy? cool!! new design! everything looks old but awesome!! like a pirates game should be!  I really believe these series has a lot of potential just like mount and blade Warband, but is not going to improve if the developers dont work harder on it, for example the marketing side. they have to make their games known!! how many Pirates RPG games are out there?? not many!! And this game has a loooot of potential!!   A good way to make their games know it by bringing Age of Pirates 2 to steam (but a fixed and playable version, not the barely finished one), that games is amazing!!! I'm sure people will like it!   Bugs Fixing!! And game balancing. Black Mark studios your games have some bugs and it is normal in a game to have some but please try to make them minimal. And also be more forgiving. New comers may not enjoy the game if it is still hard on easy difficulty.   I higly recommend this game! I love it as much as I do with Age of Pirtes 2, But be aware that the game is diffcult. Prepare a lot at the begining. dont waste money so easily, get a lot of Exp, and... Make the missions one at a time so you can understand the game better.   It is a great game! Seriously! but hard.   8/10",

            "review_text": "First off; let me just say it is NOT NECESSARY TO GET ARRESTED AND LOOSE ALL STUFF AT THE BEGINNING.   This game would be a great game of piracy, and/or mercantilism - whatever would be your cup of tea. While it has a certain degree of railroading, it is also possible to play it sandbox and just sail around being a jolly roger in search of bounty and glory.   There's just a few things that irritates and one thing that makes the game near unplayable.  Let me just first underline that the sea battles, while a challenge, are well executed, give an air of realism, and that you actually can sail around the world in first or third person view - rather than reverting to a map mode. And that despite now being more than 10 years old the graphics still hold up, and it is in my opinion the nicest open-world pirate game available (Next to Sid Meyer's Pirate Gold - not the 2004 edit, the 90s ones - and I need not say that the graphics of those games have not aged well..). There was a time when I would just set my ship to sail along the coast, and have the game run in the background while I did stuff IRL.   Also - you not only hire a crew - you have a range of specialists - which is cool. This is a feature in other pirate games as well, but they are mostly third person strategic affairs - which this is not.   Also, rare in our time, the game is a challenge. No quest markers, you actually need to take notes - morrowind style, and this is a concious choice made by the developers. Which I find a nice change from the incredible hand-holding of Bethesda and their ilk. !This and that quest marker in your ♥♥♥♥ing face! However, this could be better executed, and choosing to have rhetorics as a character specialty is a waste of your real-life energy.  Which brings me to the negatives: The game is developed by russians, the translation is so-so, which makes for some interesting and usually incredibly rude dialogue. These dialogues are usually also just with 2 options. Some insulting line, or an opt-out - also usually an insult. This I can take, we are pirates after all.  Worse are the controls. You'd better select fencing as a speciality, because that is a nightmare. These horrible keys also affect the sea battles, but not so adversely. The range of actions are at the same time quite extensive, which is streneous. There is way to train your fighting skills, only through actual fighting, which can of course provoke the guards of the area, which will get you killed. This is the only game which I would consider selecting the easiest option, or even cheating. It is extremely unforgiving.  The game lacks a tutorial - but there are some online. They also suffer from bad translation and individualized experience of those who wrote them, so use them IN COMBINATION, with a critical eye. I also suspect certain quests need to be executed in a certain order, or you will not gain access to other quests - which can break your save (at the start of the game). I was fortunate in this regard, but there were 2 quests I was never offered because the order in which I talked to certain people. So be very aware (especially because of the abscence of quest markers). Also, note that it is NOT NECESSARY TO GET ARRESTED AND LOOSE ALL STUFF AT THE BEGINNING. Just be patient and ask around.   There is no built-in edit capability, although a fix has been made. Also there are no mods for this game as far as I am aware. While the graphics hold, the selection of ship types are sufficient, I imagine some would love to mod clothes, armor and generally stuff. This would be exceptionally hard.  Finally, and what I consider a game-breaker is the way the game starts. A tutorial of sorts I guess, but it is incredibly lengthy (took me a day first time, and the tutorial walk-throughs are essential for this), and it ends up in a scene where I have to face down 2 pirates that both have more health, more strength and better fencing skills than me, and they can also fire their guns. So you can imagine how well that turns out.. So I haven't made it off the island.  How do I know the sea battles are nice, how can I know that sailing into the sunset is a beautiful experience in this game? Once I had a ripped edition of this game, where the entire island was cut out of the game. Yeah - why do I have to suffer through it? Why did the game designers make the game this way?  So if you consider yourself A REAL ♥♥♥♥ING HARDCORE SEADOG, then you are welcome to try it, and pass the island, and you will be rewarded by a great game. But you may save yourself some time and convert the game files to be cheat compatible, 'cause you can't get past the pirates. It is impossible.",

            "review_text": "This has been my favorite Pirate series since 2003 the Pirates of the Caribbean game developed by Akella and originally known as Sea Dogs. Now that's the kind of game Disney should have kept on working! This is the kind of game that Sid Meier should have imagined! The best Pirates game when it comes to strategy, arcade, adventure and simulation genres. It is now a bit outdated and then Age of Pirates was another attemt at making a graphically awesome comeback which they suceeeded in my opinion. But that came at a cost of having to deal with a bunch of bugs due to the development of a new engine and the lack of funding. So that resulted in the leftovers for the modding community. And this version of the game is just one of the examples what came out of it. Maybe this is a dying series just like Mount &amp; Blade version of the Caribbean which now known as Blood &amp; Gold: Caribbean!  But I really hope that just like with the new version of Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord on it's way hopefully this year. I hope the same way this game one day will be picked back up again and become the greatest Caribbean adventure ever made! Till then I'm personally looking forward to something less great, but still fun and that game is called Sea of Thiefs, hopefully will be released in 2017",

            "review_text": "Interesting concept, but immensly frustrating in execution. This doesn't have a learning curve, it has a learning cliff.  The camera is semi-locked in an ackward position behind your back when you're on land, making melee fighing difficult to impossible. And you'll be on land for a while... the tutorial/intro takes hours. It throws a tons of info you don't need immediately at you (for the only time btw). and does it this almost entirely in dialog text that is poorly translated/localized. These have little bearing on the reality of the games buggy combat engine.   You'll be hoarding every peso, and grinding every quest, on the locked intro island to get your ship. Then you'll need more money to get a crew and supplies. This will cost as much as the ship and there will be no money left to earn/steal.  If you somehow get off that rock, you'll burn through most of your ship's ammo and crew in the intro naval fight as your 'seasoned' crew misses with 90+% of their shots. This doesn't improve with range or practice. Boarding is land combat on a ship set.  Sailing is what I was looking for and this almost delivered here. The sailing is true to the ideas of riding a wind, but the simple controls and slow pace that results leave you reaching immediately for the limited quick travel tools.   Once you get to the open world you're broke, half dead, surrounded by overpowered enemies, and unable to run or fight your way out of anything. The translations get worse and this ends up becoming unplayable.   ",

For those that read this, understand that the game is poorly translated from russian, and is by no-means 100% accurate. I want you to imagine that the devs put all of the game's dialogue into google translate, and maybe that will prepare you for the difficulties ahead.  If you played Sea Dogs 2/ Pirates of the Caribbean, the 2003 game published by bethesda, don't expect the same level of quality from this. That is the mistake I made. I understand that for 15 dollars, it is a good game, However, this is far slower than the originals and more difficult, so make your decision wisely. I'd give this a 4.5/10, if 10 was the aforementioned game.",
