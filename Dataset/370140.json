    "description": "Nebulous is a physics-based puzzle game where you must help guide Commander Dash Johnson, a trapped astronaut, through maze-like levels, seeking the next wormhole to his eventual freedom. Arrange the pieces so that when he falls, gravity guides him safely (and probably painfully) to the end!",
