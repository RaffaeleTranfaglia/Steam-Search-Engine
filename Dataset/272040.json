    "description": "KAMI is deceptively simple: fold out coloured paper to fill the screen in as few moves as possible. Relaxing and easy to pick up, you'll soon find yourself deep in contemplation to perfect each puzzle. Created by State of Play, famous for their handcrafted aesthetic, KAMI has been created with real paper in an elegant Japanese theme.",

            "review_text": "It''s a very pretty game, with nice soothing music in the menu. The aim in each of the puzzles is to 'clear' the screen by making all the paper the same colour by applying coloured paper to it in as few moves as possible. There isn't any time element to it, so solving the puzzles is quite relaxing and when the game gets tricky it becomes challenging, but not in a frustrating way. There's also a hint system to solve puzzles that you're stuck on. For the price, it's a lovely little indie game with very nice graphics which will probably get you several hours of gameplay, there is also a complex set of puzzles too.  (I think it's very resonably priced) - Definitley worth a try if you love a good puzzle game!",

            "review_text": "Summary: Fun, very casual puzzles that are nice to wind down or relax with. But if you're looking for something very intensely engaging or a massive timesink, this is probably not going to be it.   Pros:  Very nice to look at whilst still being quite minimal in style. Unique puzzles that make you think a little differently - to be precise, think very much in 2D.  Relaxing - I like to play Kami when I want to zone out of work or at the end of the day. It's challenging enough to be engaging but not so addicting (for me, anyway) that you want to play it until 2am. At that late/level of tiredness you probably couldn't get anywhere with the harder puzzles anyway.   Cons:  The music. I just switched it off, but then, it's just not my type of background music. It might be yours.  This is a VERY casual puzzle game with no extras (other achievements besides 'Oh hey, you completed the level, here's the next one', or a story). It's part of its appeal but may also turn people off who are looking for something a little more exciting.",

            "review_text": "Edit: I have now played Kami for a substantial period of time, and my esteem for it has only grown.  You should probably spend more than ten minutes on a game before you recommend it, or write a review, but I never do what I should probably do, and I'm not planning on changing that just now.   Anyhow... the game is a basic math-based puzzler, albeit a spatial form-based game as opposed to numeric form-based endeavor, all the same - if you like thinking, this game is fun. And if you are not sharp, it is likely fun, too, it just may take a bit longer to progress, but the game design allows for revision, so it ultimately teaches everyone up to the same level. I love it - as a mathlete, and as a fan of creative gaming.  Best endorsement I can say: I bought two more copies of the game within ten minutes of playing it, to be gifted to my girl and my brother. As a purchase decision, it is that easily a no-brainer, despite the cerebral content within. I hope you enjoy it as well.",

You fill paper fields with color, trying to fill the whole screen with one color at last. The animations and the SoundFx makes this so awesome. In this game you use your visual imagination and recognize relationships between colors and pattern. There is no understanding of numbers needed.   But the implementation is unfortunately the worst on this game. - Music: One asiatic sounding loop, that playing in the background.  + Music: You can turn it off ;D - No learning curve. It is more try and error at some puzzles. At the end of the game it feels easy again -.- + Hints: Everyday you get new credits to unlock new hints. - Hints: You need use the hints before the puzzle and if you unlock more hints, so do what they really show, or you will miss the following hint. - Progress bubble: Warning! You will not unlock new levels. It's only the progress. Really! - No achievements ;-( WHY? Other mobile ports have managed to introduce them.  So if you don't care of this pro and contra carousel, then buy the game. For that cheap price you will have over 5 hours of puzzle.  Similar game with relationship of colors and patterns is  LYNE .",

On the down side, the music is boringly repetitive (and more 'Asian junk' than real Japanese), and overall the game is a bit cheap on what it provides (well it's casual, duh).  Personally, I haven't finished it, nor have I gone very far in it, because I think it becomes quickly very hard, and a bit random. Mind my word: obviously it is not a random game, it's just that... I don't know, finding the solution feels a bit random, a bit too much on the trial-and-error way of solving it... So in the end, I don't really enjoy it.  As I said: a bit bland casual game, but if you know what you're in for, I would recommend it only for that.",

My only complaints lie with the 'special' puzzles that didn't seem as well-designed as the main game, namely the last set; I completed one of the puzzles in THREE fewer moves than needed, which makes it seem like it wasn't thoroughly tested.
