            "review_text": "There are 3 things that make Remember Me a memorable game:  1) Fighting: Although technically you just keep pressing a button, timing is important and the combos themselves are put together by you. It is not really the punch or kick you pick but their 'type' - some will heal you but cause less damage, others increase your Focus bar so that you can unleash special attacks once it is full and there are those that can break some enemies' defenses. It is very rewarding to have your own moves and you unlock some special attacks even towards the end of the game. Remember Me remembers to remain new and original.  2) Be Kind, Rewind: Occasionally you get to see a cutscene, a memory of someone who is vital to the story. This is a memory you can tamper with. Why? Because it is important for that person to remember something else. To remember that it happened in a different way. You start moving your mouse clock- or anticlockwise (depending on whether you want to go back or forward during the short film) and try to look for glitches, items you can tamper with. And once you make the changes the memory may turn out to be a completely different experience. This is an amazing feature and my only issue with it is that only a couple were included in the story.  3) The environment / story: This is a believable world, a world full of leaping creatures in alleyways, sewers and full of robots / drones doing the daily chores in shops and various facilities. You notice ATM machines offering cash in exchange for memories. And when you get to climb up and reach the rooftops as you finally leave behind the dark slums you spot the Eiffel Tower. It looks the same in 2084 but its gleaming whiteness is in contrast with the riots and struggle and sadness happening on the streets of Paris. You, Nilin, are tasked to solve this problem. While at first the game wants you to find out who you are it gradually incorporates more elements of this new world into the story and makes Nilin realise who she is and what exactly is the Big Picture.  Easily a must grab for sci-fi fans. Pick it up if you are eager to get your hands on something original. In the meantime, Remember You Soon!",

            "review_text": " Remember Me  focuses on Nilin, a memory hunter working for an underground resistance called the Errorists. When the game starts, she has been stripped of nearly all her memories by mega-corporation Memorize. With the help of a mysterious man named Edge, she goes on a quest to bring down Memorize and recover her lost memories.   You may not believe me, but when I bought this game, I did not expect nothing extra - just a regular game with good concept. I got something more - emotional story that will make you think about it. If you are gonna buy it, you will like the story.  Thing I personaly like: +Good concept (Paris in year 2084, corporation working with memories...) +As I said before, story is grat +Combat system: You have 4 kinds of 'Pressens', each of them does something different (damage, life regen, cooldown reduction, increasing strength of next pressen) You are free to combine them as you please + Atmosphere + Good characters + Logic puzzles + Quote of someone famous on beginning of every chapter  Things I don't like: -Short story -Game tells you what to do all the time( at least it's explained by story 'Sensen technology') -If there would be open world, it would be one of the best games of this type -Some passages are boring, some hard, some really easy  7.3/10",

Now after completing it, I am even more mesmerized by it. It`s amazing!  The story is great and would be appreciated a lot by sci-fi lovers. The music, made by some crazy genius mixing contemporary classics and breakcore, suits it incredibly well. And the visuals... OH THE VISUALS! This is the most beautiful game I ever played. For real. The concept, the design, the detail, EVERYTHING, I feel speechless to describe. You must see it ot believe it.  Many people hate the combat system, but actually it`s not that bad. I used only the first two combos trough the whole game - X-X-X and Y-X-Y-X-Y. It`s true it gets little repetitive, but it`s definitely not a random mashing of buttons. It was able to even get me in somekind of meditative state in the long battles. It`s really arcade-ish and strange in a way.  The main character - Nilin is not you usual pumped up sexualized bimbo. On the opposite she is emotional, strong and intelligent and it`s not hard to get under your sking because of what she is and not how she looks.   Be careful before buying Remember me, though. This game is extremely linear and scripted. As well as the most beautiful it is also the most scripted game I ever played. There is always only one option and you can never get out of the scenario.   Actually I would say this is more like a graphic novel with elements of gameplay : D If you don`t have problems being led by the nose from the game creators and you want to experience a great story and amazing visuals - don`t hesitate and play this game!

            "review_text": "Remember Me is a flawed game, but it's really pretty awesome. I always prefer games which try to do something unique and maybe don't entirely hit their mark over games which stick to established tropes. Remember Me plays like a linear Batman game, but it has a lot of very clever ideas built in. Custom combos, memory remixing, reactive music; it doesn't all work completely as intended, but there are some really great ideas being utilised.  If you like the story and setting of games like Syndicate, Deus Ex, or Binary Domain, you'll feel right at home with Remember Me. The writing gets a bit corny at times and the secondary voice actors are less than stellar, but I'm always a fan of a good futuristic dystopia. I hope they get a chance to make a sequel because they were on the verge of something great here. It's well worth your time to try this game.",

            "review_text": "WOW! How can so many mainstream reviewers be wrong about this?   Yes theres yellow markers on where to jump.  Yes the characters do have some silly/odd names. Yes the combat feels light and nothing like BATMAN: AA &amp; AC.  But the main question is does this detract from the game making it not worth playing? Hell no!  The combat is light and fluid just like the main protaganist Nilin so it fits the character very well. While some may find it annoying that your combos do get broken mid-flow by having to dodge other incoming attacks thats how street fights go. While you combo to death one baddie do you expect his four friends to take a break, order coffe and read the local paper, all while you pummel his face and body with your fancy moves? If you say 'Yes!' to this then may I suggest something more like Cooking Mama™, an EA game or a trip to the boxing gym so you can flail on a punching bag. The combat if fast, fluid and most importantly entertaining. The fact that you can edit your combos mid-fight to help heal or reduce your timers is very helpful in a pinch.  The visuals are totally fantastic. The atmosphere oozes throughout the game from the slums of District 404 to the heavenly hights of Neo-Paris. Some of the areas are nothing more than fancy corridors linking one part to the next but I found myself walking through instead of running like i could have. Looking around at all the little details hidden in plain sight from the puddles on the floor, items on tables, robots doing their thing and street vendors selling their wares. What I found was a vivid living world pulling me in. Even the 'journal entries' are interesting. Adding to the game instead of distracting from it. The yellow markers for the jumping sections do look odd but if they were not there in some areas you wouldn't know where to go and would leed to alot of wondering around with that 'Where do I go now?' expression. An option to turn these off would have been nice touch for those who don't like them.  While remixing peoples memories I found meself engrossed in almost every detail. I found myself wondering how I would react if these were my memories being alterd. Would I be the man I am today? Would I turn to the dark side? These are fantastic ideas but as many reviewers have mentioned before me '...there should have been more of theres segments...'  As you may be wondering I really like this game and as you're reading this now I hope I have hellped you resolve some of the things that may have stopped you from buying this game before now. This is a game that will (hopefully) make you think about events in your life and the lifes of others. How these events if changed or stolen chould change the very person you are today. All while keeping you engaged in the story and wanting to progress to see what happens next is a good thing and I would reccomend this to everyone. I'm just sorry that I put off buying this title and I hope to see Remember Me 2 in the future.  SUBJECTIVE SUMMARY &gt;&gt; Well worth the money for a solid original game and story.",

            "review_text": "Remember Me is an absolutely unforgettable game. As Nilin, the player escape from a facility in a futuristic Paris in a dystopian future, trying to avoid her memory from being wiped completely. NIlin cannot remember a lot of things, but wants to - so she joins the Errorist's cause (a group of rebels) to stop the Memorize corporation from taking control of people's memories. The corporations buys, trades, &amp; sells them on the market; and some people even try to get them removed. Nilin is also on the quest to find out more about her past and to try to confront it, while she's at it. Nilin was a former Memory Hunter, so she has the ability to alter, remove, and take people's memories. And well, that's just for starters here.   What sounds like an excellent premise on a global level for such a dystopia, it only starts off only as a cool plot device for a while. But, a bit later, it also gets very personal and intriguing, eventually elevating the game's story and characters to excellent heights. If that isn't enough - the (English) voice-acting is also excellent. Finding 'Journal' entries throughout the game is also interesting and worth finding, as they will further immense the player into the excellent game-world, its inhabitants, and everything that this game has to offer.   The game's art direction and music are absolutely exceptional. The music is an orchestral score blended with electronic music elements - and it sounds great, creative, and absolutely unique. If that isn't enough, the music knows exactly how to hit the right mood, to the point that each note and each song is quite meticiulously placed at the right moment and time.  The game's combat system is pretty cool, feeling similar to the style of combat found in Batman: Arkham series of games - but, there's a lot more dodging and other things involved, as well. As you perform more combos, moves, and find things in the game-world - you will unlock more moves, more different types of attacks (some heal, some regenerate your cooldown on special moves, etc), and more combo sequences that you can perform. Once you learn more move, combos and special moves, more enemies and different types get thrown at you - which causes the combat to get awesome, hectic, complex, deep, and challenging.   Gameplay varies, mixing elements from all kinds of different genres. The game doesn't deviate much from its linear path, as there isn't much for side-quests and things to find. You might find things like Journal entries and upgrades to Nilin, but they won't be too far beaten from the linear path. While there are combat sequences, there are also platforming sequences (where the game is often pointing you where to go and move for the platforming), stealth elements (where you have to avoid getting scene or caught), and there are even puzzles to solve (like what you'd see in 'classic' adventure games). While all of these elements are solid, it's the actual sum of its parts that create this whole that eventually makes them great.  The coolest of the puzzles are the 'Remix Memory' puzzles, where you go into a person's mind and change their memory completely, bending it to Nilin's will to get whatever desired outcome she wants from them. The player is given a bunch of 'glitches' in the memories and must figure when and where to change them. Players will rewind, fast-forward, slow down, pause and select certain elements, all in the hope of getting Nilin's desired outcome - while there are only unfortunately a few of these, all of these puzzles are all creative, interesting, and excellent.   Remember Me starts off as a slow-burner, hand-holding the player quite a bit early on (to teach you its numerous different mechanics) and to try to immerse into its game-world. The game is always enjoyable and intriguing because of its art direction, game-world, music &amp; premise - but once it gets really going, it gets fantastic. While it does take a bit to get really going somewhere mind-blowing w/ its story, combat, characters, and gameplay - once it gets going, this is when the game goes from good to great. Remember Me is a game that should not be missed...and definitely not forgotten anytime soon.  Final Grade = B+",

            "review_text": "I honestly came into this one expecting to hate it. People had panned the combat as difficult or confusing, and the game to be nothing special.  Lucky for me I still went ahead and picked this up (at a steep discount, though, so take that for what it is).   From the moment the game started, I was intrigued by the setting. Though full of sci-fi tropes, the game still managed to capture my interest and imagination, and I found myself caring for the protagonist as she made her way from beginning to end. I even found myself worried that she was, at times, too trusting of those around her and I worried that she would make the wrong decision - and though I had hoped at times I could make the decisions for her, the linearity of the gameplay did not take away from the final product.   As for the combat, I personally had no trouble figuring it out. The 'build a combo' system isn't quite what I expected - what I had expected was something more difficult. Basically you get four different combinations of X and Y presses on the controller (or your keyboard equivalent). Over time you unlock different 'powers' to place in each of these slots... so if your combo is X-X-X you can have one X be a powerful hit and the other be a heal, or maybe something that lowers the cooldown of your presens (big power moves). It made sense to me, and I managed to adjust and play with the combos to suit my playstyle and for different parts of the game (easily done on the fly).  Getting the combos to work wasn't an issue either... but be warned, this isn't a button-mashing game. For the most part, combos all require calm, regular and deliberate button presses. If you are accustomed to going crazy with the controller, you will be frustrated as getting any of Nilin's (the main character) powers to work properly requires combos to succeed.   tl;dr  Graphically impressive game with a linear, yet rewarding story, interesting and appropriately challenging combat with some climbing, discovery all in a great science fiction setting. Game clocked in at about 9 1/2 hours for me, which I think was about right. Great buy, especially on sale.",

            "review_text": "I know this game is a little on the older side but I finally got a chance to play it and I feel like it could have been one of the most underrated games in recent history. A lot of the features of this game are absolutely fantastic and judging my articles about the game the one gripe most people had was the combat (which honestly wasn't that bad). To get right into what this game is about, Remember Me is a 3rd person action game with combo based fighting mechanics and a parkour style level progression design. Essentially it is like many other climb, jump, crawl games like Tomb Raider, Uncharted and Enslaved but the main character instead of using projectile weapons only uses her fists and her power arm. Now the Combo system runs a little differently from other combo fighting games in that there are 4 primary 'pressens' with 4 separate, and each more complicated, combos . However with these combos you can set any presser to each combo. The longer the combo the more xp you can get the more pressens you can unlock. There are 4 separate Pressens; Power which hits hard, Regen which heals you some each time you use it in a combo, Chain which increases a combo multiplier making it do more damage and get more xp (these are best used at the end of the a combo) and cool down which lowers the time required to use a S-Pressen.    S-Pressens are powerful, specialized pressens that you can only use once per certain time period and must have enough focus to use it. There are 5 S-Pressens which include Fury which lets Nilin (the main character) attack with each hit being more powerful than the last, Sensen Dos which stuns enemies and is very useful versus specific enemies, Rust in Pieces is a bomb that is effective versus robots, Camo which cloaks Nilin allowing her to move around regaining health and being able to perform a takedown on powerful enemies and logic bomb which can break shields and heavily damage enemies. Now the Specials and the basic combat system albeit are unique in their names and how they look, deep down it is just a generic combo based system and can get repetitive over time and can be prone to problems with connecting hits.   My biggest problem with the game however is the buggy parkour system. As it is a lot of times the camera control can be all over the place and Nilin could miss a jump that she should have been able to make. At times the parkour makes sense but other times it feels like it was just put there to have something for the time between fights and memory syncs.     One of the coolest features of this game however is the memory stealing/manipulating and as far as I'm concerned is not used enough in this game. Nilin's main ability (one of the main reasons she is such a sought after person) is that she can manipulate a characters memories of an event and completely change their personality of what happened during that event. During this mechanic you can go forward and backwards during a memory and slightly alter things in the room to make the characters do things including killing each other or remembering something to not be as tragic. It was used 3 or 4 times throughout the game but just the process of going into someone's mind and changing a memory to get a different outcome was absolutely facinating.    Enough about the gameplay, on to the story. The year is 2084 in Neo-Paris and Memorize corporation has invented a new implant called the Sensen which enables others to share memories with others, remove memories or even sell memories to earn money. During this time due to an infection and corruption of the implant, a new race of humans developed called Leapers. These Leapers are very basic in their mental capacity and are very aggressive towards non-Leapears. Enter our character Nilin who is a memory manipulator but in the beginning she has had almost all of her memories wiped because she had been captured by memorized and been punished. However thanks to someone called Edge, she is able to escape and work to find her memories and try to take down Memorize. Throughout the game Nilin has to manipulate the memories of many in order to get to the bottom of the whole situation of Memorize and the Sensen. The story is very unique and it is wonderful to have a main female protagonist that is the strongest character in the game.     The graphics of this game are absolutely beautiful and to top it all off, Dontnod Entertainment really did a top notch job of creating a very beautiful and realistic future Paris. The whole game is very aesthetically pleasing with the variations locations being so different showing the true difference between the impoverished and the wealthy in Neo-Paris. On top of that Olivier Deriviere did an absolutely fantastic job bringing the soundtrack to life to match the game beautifully. The music is much like the works done by Daft Punk in Tron Legacy in that Deriviere mixed a bit of electronic with orchestral sound. The end result is a soundtrack that I have ended up listening to repeatedly at work while I have been programming. The voice actors also do a fantastic job bringing their characters to life and make the dialogue all that much better.    Overall this game is absolutely fantastic, from the story, characters, music, graphics etc. The only downside is the generic gameplay and flawed camera angles during the parkour/climbing mechanics. I would highly recommend this game and I look forward to see if Capcon would bring us a sequel at some time in the future.  • Story - 95 • Gameplay - 70 • Graphics - 90 • Sound - 100 • Fun - 90 • Replay value - 80 ",

            "review_text": "Remember Me has lots of potential to be a great game, but the heights that it's trying to reach is hampered by an underwhelming gameplay. One can clearly see the ambition that the development team was going for, however, it doesn't translate very well in the game. My main concerns are with the Combat and level design, where everything is simplified and doesn't offer variety. The latter, especially, is somewhat disappointing, since the backdrops are sprawling and detailed, and players are left with linear pathways and simple verticality. I can imagine the possibilities that they could have achieved with a little more tinkering and polish.  But this is a story-centric game, and choosing between one aspect over another, you'd have to go and focus with what's hot and trending. The story in Remember Me is good. Nothing mind-blowing or emotional; it just needs to develop its characters more, and not make everything so coincidental. It's very exposition-heavy, and they were clearly planning for the long term, since the world, characters, past and present events, are all laid out for the player. It's like Mass Effect: the universe and everything that's happened in it is explained in the first game, and further explored and polished in the subsequent games. If Dontnod could turn this into a franchise, it would be great. The premise is cool, and the world is oozing with style. So go ahead and buy this game. Make Capcom see reason, because it would be such a waste if the suits are just going to throw it out.   Some things to take note of:   *The camera is pretty unreliable, and can move erratically when indoors. This leads to major problems during enemy encounters.  *Combat is very repetitive, and there's no variation at all; you just do combo after combo, and there's not much skill involved. Since this is a story-focused title, I suggest that you play in easy mode, since the only thing that hard mode does is make your enemies hit sponges.  *Boss battles have obscure QTE segments. I say obscure because the icons that flash on the screen, doesn't represent keyboard or controller icons; they have their own unique prompts that follow the stylish aesthetic of the whole game. If you miss a single prompt in the whole QTE segment, you're going to have to lower the boss' health again - and do the QTE segment all over again.  *You can pause cutscenes, but you can't skip it. This also applies to second playthroughs.  *Uses an autosave system. No manual saving for you, little man!     And there you have it.",

            "review_text": "Remember Me is not perfect. But to be honest, nowadays, what is?  I wholeheartedly recommend this game on a sale, however. Full price, eh. My record of 9.5 hours is pretty much the entire game length on hard difficulty, although I did miss some collectibles. Therefore, 28 EUR is steep. But I got this at -85% off, and I have no right to complain.  The story was VERY interesting, the setting was unique. Neo-Paris, 2084, where SENSEN technology is capable of storing your memory data so that you can erase the memories you don't want, relive memories you hold close, and use your memories as currency... and you're Nilin, an Errorist, who is guided by Edge trying to dismantle this system, which is supposedly 'flawed' and should be destroyed.  Soundtrack fits the futuristic theme of the game, it's glitchy orchestral, like a movie soundtrack mixed with electronic and effects. Great support for the events that occur.  Gameplay is primarily three things:   - Combat: (combo-based system, combos can be customized in order to have their elements (pressens) be POWER, REGEN, COOLDOWN REDUCTION and CHAIN; and you also get Sensen Abilities which need a Focus bar which you get from punching your opponents enough. Simple enough.  Some people in the negative reviews might claim 'they couldn't get into the game because the combat is too difficult', but you honestly just have to press the right button at the right times, like 'right left right left right' with the right delay between them and bam you executed your 5-hit-combo. Not hard, in my opinion.  - Platforming: you need to climb on things, jump on things, move some things around, etc etc. Think of 'Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons' and that's pretty much how it goes, except you only move your one character.  - Remix sections: There aren't too many of these in the game, but they hold important plot points, where you alter the memory of others. You'll see if you play. It's interesting. Really.  ---- NOW the question is, what did I mean by this game not being perfect? There were some glaring flaws in some game design elements. Literally a flaw from a game design perspective. In order to learn more of the LORE of this game, you need to find MNESISTS. Now, they wanted to make collectible secret items... and they made those be the MNESISTS. The problem is that without them, you for example won't understand what the hell the Mnemopolis is - but these items are REALLY hidden, and if you don't know where to look, looking for them can be extremely tedious. They aren't indicated well at all, they're just tiny orange boxes, hard to find, and usually you need to go on an alternate path to find them.  So this is like playing in the Mass Effect universe, except you have to look for well-hidden secrets in order to learn the lore of the game, which you're supposedly interested in if you're interested in the plot. I think this was quite silly.  Also, by the end of the game, the enemy versatility kinda falters, they rehash some stuff from previously instead of adding something new.  In the end, it was still a great game.  - PROS: Interesting story and unique settings Good soundtrack that supports said setting Okay combat (others might disagree but they just need to get a sense of timing I guess, it really is not difficult)  - CONS: Some platforming is a bit tedious The combat can get repetitive by the end because of rehashed enemies (too much saber force) THE ITEMS THAT GIVE YOU THE LORE ARE HIDDEN COLLECTIBLES. Terrible decision, even if it kinda makes sense, but not really. Makes looking for them tedious, you might want to use a guide. The antagonists' motives just aren't very deep by the time you actually get to them. But the plot overall makes up for it.  Recommended. Not at full price, but at a greater discount, definitely.",

No patterns to learn since every combat will be different even when you repeat it a lot of times, and button mashing results in fast death and frustration.  So what is Remember Me all about? Well, its a fast paced and spectacular roller coaster action game with a very good story and gorgeous stylish visuals. There is also more to this game than meets the eye. The story is not only good, its also deep on a philosophical level if you care for this kind of stuff, and it does something that no other videogame dared to do for many years, namely social critique. I have never seen a game taking so many stabs at the problems of our society and culture as this game did. I bow down with respect in front of the person(s) who wrote the story for this game.  The combat is exceptional. It can be confusing and frustrating at first, but once you figure things out, it offers a great choice of options that you can use in inventive ways....first playthrough on errorist difficulty i was more concerned about the story so i neglected the combat, but second playthrough on hard difficulty is where the combat really shined for me. It offered a lot of freedom of choice, it forced me to understand and use the combo system properly, and it offered easy ways out of difficult situations if used properly.... but i strongly recommend to NOT play on hard on your first playthrough, ignore this advice at your own risk.  Your enjoyment of this game will depend on whether or not you are open to something different, if you are able to accept and enjoy a linear game with an unusual combat system. Looking at reviews, most negative comments are about game being linear and about the combat...there is nothing wrong with a linear game when its done right (and this one is) and the combat is great if you make the effort to get into it.   My only regret is that i bought this game on discount, i should have bought it full price because its more than worth it.",

            "review_text": "I played this game Shortly after Tomb Raider and just after i finished Assassins Creed 4, and to be fair i think i enjoyed it more than ac4, its a different style of game much more similar to Tomb Raider but with a more in depth Combat system and a Really good story and atmosphere that drags you in if you let it.  Graphically 9/10 - A really detailed and atmospheric world, have seen better but not by much.  Sound 10/10 Really enjoyed the soundtrack Worked extremely well in this game and had the right tone and feeling all the way through.  Story - 9/10 I enjoyed it bit short but honest and believable nice twists and always seemed to be moving forwards.  Gameplay 8/10 - Combos are modifyable by the player to make your own unique combos i guess from a mix of 4 skills healing damage cooldown reduction and i guess powerbooster, combos are easy to memorize but hard to get some of the bigger ones off without learning how to dodge properly, you have 5 special moves that work in various ways and it was enjoyable without being too clunky. I Really Liked the memory resynchs probably my favorite part, and a bit of old school platforming/problem solving.  Overall 9/10 Surprise hit for me, deserved much better than it got on release its up there with tombraider for me as playability goes and how much i enjoyed it, felt like i was playing an epic AAA production movie with quality sound and gorgeous graphics (Everything Maxxed on a 550Ti) get it on sale if you like this style of game, some hate it but why i cant tell as i enjoyed every minute.",

            "review_text": "Remember Me is an odd duck of a game. It's a mix of ideas all thrown into a pot, some of which don't pan out and others that turn out really, really good.  First and foremost: don't buy this game at full price. It's entertaining, but it is by no means worth the $50 base they are still trying to charge. However, it is one of those games that does get exponentially better the lower it gets, and I found it to be a very solid $10-$12 mid-range title. It doesn't go on sale very often, either, so get it when it gets down to that range.  The actual gameplay itself is a bit of trial-and-error. The combat follows the now-standard Batman and Sleeping Dogs formula with the twist of being able to create your own combo systems. It's not as fleshed out as I would like, and the controls are not as tight as others with the system. However, being able to reset timers or heal yourself via punching is a nice addition.  Some of the cooler segments involve rearranging memories, in which you are placed into a scene and must make small changes to it that greatly affect the outcome (i.e. make a doctor kill a patient instead of curing him by messing with the hospital room, etc). The only downside is that the system is used very infrequently, with only two or so such scenes in the first several episodes. Again, a lot of cool ideas but none of them fleshed out much.  What really makes the game, though, is the story and atmosphere. The game is absolutely gorgeous, and in the absence of good Cyberpunk games, it really does stand out. Nilin is a great character, and the city is breathaking on systems playing the High settings. I found myself actively trying to find the little Journal Mnesists things so that I could learn about the world you play through. They did a great job of building a futuristic Paris. I wish it was not such a linear game (especially for one that promotes the exploration aspects of it), but what paths we are set on really demand a lot of admiration.  It's not a perfect game, by any means, and the half-hearted attempts at some of the gameplay gimmicks keep it from being a true AAA title. That said, however, it really is a very unique and mostly fun game that will likely leave you entertained, if for no other reason than the story, visuals, and grand locations. It's a game with a ton of ambition behind it that fell just short of being fantastic, and it could warrant a sequel to tweak or expand what it does right. Well worth a steep sale price, but avoid at retail.",

Really boring. :( - There are 8 chapters in game, only 4 (!!!) times we can playng with the main feature of the game - 'remixing memory'. Very stupid devs decision. - Closer to end - very easy fighting - Absolutely no side-quests. I understand, that its not RPG. But this game deserves more quests, cause the world is welldone, and it'll be very interesting to explore. But... - The base storyline is very ordinary   After all this bad words, that I wrote, why is so high rank? Well, I'll explain. I dont want to play COD №100, Elder Scrolls №50, etc. I want to see fresh ideas in gameplay and new worlds. And these devs give me the oportunity.

This is unfortunately not nearly as well-written or engaging as Deus Ex, but it does present a similar sort of experience (and with much better graphics. Worse music though). Remember Me runs really well too, and plays great-- the fighting is actually really fun despite the terrible lack of enemy variety, and the ability to nimbly leap over enemies as you're comboing them really makes you feel like you're controlling a skilled fighter (serioulsy, the nimbleness is off the hook here, and a nice departure from the usual cover-based face-shooting of Every Other Action Game Ever). The main character Nilin is another reason to play-- the character model is really a nice design, and i love the way she gets all out of breath after running a lot and the way she kind of looks around while she's walking-- these are great details that really add to you caring about her. Hell, play it just because you get to play as a cool biracial French woman with a sweet haircut instead of the usual Generic Beefcake White Dude-- an extremely refreshing departure on this count as well (and if it bothers you that everyone is speaking English in a game set in freaking Paris, there's actually the option to switch the audio to French with English subtitles, so if you're a great big hipster like me and want it to seem more authentic then you're in luck).   Short version: very nice looking and never frustratingly difficult, and although the story is basically a Luc Besson movie stretched over ten hours, it does at least broach on an interesting subject and also makes you care about the character and what happens to her. Definitely a solid purchase if you're into Sci-Fi, though if you're not you can probably skip it unless, again, you want the rare experience of playing a game where the character isn't like the character in every other game out there.",

The graphics and art direction are absolutely phenomenal. I'd almost solely recommend this game on the strength of it's visuals, it's that good. The game has a very uneven story though it's bursting with originality. The writing is smart enough to ask to right kind of questions and there are some truly memorable moments in the 9 chapters that comprise the story. Nilin, who already stands out from most video game protagonists by being a woman of colour, is written with the right balance of emotion and toughness. She feels vulnerable but is always capable of getting the job done. In between each chapter Nilin monologues about what's she done and how she feels; there are some genuinely interesting moments of pathos for her that flesh out her personality. She's much more interesting that other characters in these types of games such as Kratos or Dante. Remember Me's biggest fault is the gameplay. This is a character action game with a total of 5 combos. Changing what your combos do is a good idea in theory and having multiple enemy types helps but it doesn't change that you essentially are pushing the same combination of buttons for the entire game. This is going to be a problem for many people, especially if you're looking for a challenging experience. The combat doesn't nearly have as much depth as competing games in the same genre. If you're new to the action genre, or you want an adequate action game with a good story, then I recommend Remember Me. If you want a highly polished action game, look elsewhere.",

            "review_text": "Ca. 14 hours until the end for me. I saw no bugs or had any crashes I remember. The game has good graphics and the controls are good. You are playing a woman protagonist in levels which are more or less corridor levels. There is always only one good way to go. Sometimes you find clues about secrets, then you should look at that clue, find the secret and go back to your old route.  The fights are melee fights, where you always use combos. You can just try to ignore the combos but because some combos start with repeated use of the same attack you can even customize this.  A combo consists of a different number of either fist or foot attacks. And each but the first attack has to be of a kind. These 'kinds' are things like 'concentrate on damage', 'heal yourself', 'gather points for your other special attacks' or just enlarge the bonus of the last attack.  The farther behind in a combo the attack is, the larger is the bonus you get. Imagine something like normal+heal+enlarged heal+even more enlarged heal against a boss. You can change these combos all the time, even in the middle of fight when you realize all your combos suck against the current enemy.  The fights are fun. There is no but to this.  The moving is a bit like in Assasin's Creed, but not as good.  You can do cool moves and climb and jumb and run but only when the game allows it for a certain spot at this time. So one moment you fight for your live or just want to jump on a knee high platform... not possible. The fight is over, you can climb there without problems. Two spots look the same, but the one is the 'right' way, so to one you can do an incredible cool jump, to the other not, you die. That can be very frustrating.  If you are used to the open worlds from Assassin's Creed then you should start the game with a VERY open mind, because it is really NOT like Assassin's Creed, even if the fighting and the moving are a bit like it.  The story is ok or even good, not sure, it was good enough to keep me playing.  If you get the game for non-full price, yes, try it, it might be your new favourite. But it might be you get bored after 10 minutes.  This game was not half as good as I expected because of the vidoes and reviews.  But still, it was fun. I'd give it a 6.5 / 10.

The whole game adheres to the theme of memories, in both narrative and gameplay, which is very nice.  Levels are linear, alternating some platforming, and 'arenas' where you must fight groups of enemies. The platforming parts are not very hard, but that is complemented by the challenges of finding all hidden upgrades and bonuses. Combat is based on customizable combos, which are built by setting specific attacks on a combo template. The end result is very fluid and accomodates different play styles. Finishing long combos grants a bonus of PMP, which is like 'experience points' used to unlock new attacks. Therefore, the system rewards player's strategy and skill.  The narrative is another strong suit in Remember Me, receiving much positive criticism. The main characters are likeable, even if Nilin feels somewhat empty and bland during part of the game. The scenario of Neo-Paris is very detailed and visually well-done. The level of technology presented threatens to bring the narrative into the realms of fantasy, but I still found it acceptable to allow the exploration of the theme. The plot, if not the most innovative in its structure and elements, is still consistent and well presented. In my opinion, the rhythm of the game is good, and it only feels to be stalling at a point on its last third. With an average playtime of 10 hours, it could afford to lose an hour or so to keep sharp and engaging from start to finish.  The one real complaint I have about this game (and any other that uses the same technique) is the use of 'quick time events.' I can understand how these fit the theme of memory but still, they are very annoying and immersion-breaking, actually impairing the game experience. ",

Its vision of 70 years in the future was interesting and believable with a lot of fancy new tech around, but not too far technologically advanced. Frequently it was fun to stop and check out the scenery. There are a lot of nice little touches that add a lot of detail and flesh this world. There is some real stunning visuals in this game. Unfortunately, there are a few texture and lighting problems that make some areas just overall look crappy and don't sparkle like most of the rest of the game does. There's far too much time spent in sewers and drab dark places. Also, the world does feel empty as there aren't a lot of NPCs to fill out the levels to make it feel alive. Honestly, the story was mediocre, but not terrible. And the actual format of the game has been done so many times before. Travel to a big room and punch up a bunch of dudes and then continue on until the next fighting room is reached. The fighting wasn't anything special, but I did enjoy it. The combo system made for some interesting fights that reminded me a lot of the Batman series. The story involves a chilling future scenario where memories are bought and sold like commodities and memories can be rewritten at will by jacking into peoples brains. The expression 'Remember Me' does have a significance to the story, but I kept getting the feeling the makers weren't exactly confident in the game they were making and they kept repeating the phrase in the game so people will remember to tell their friends about the fun time they had playing through this game. The game is fairly easy. There were only a couple of difficult boss battles. It took just over 12 hours to complete the game. I liked this new mechanic where someone's memory would play out on screen and as it progresses key details can be changed to alter the memory in sometimes insignificant, sometimes profound ways. It was fun trying different combos to see how the memory changes in sometimes wildly different ways. Tweaking to get things to play out just right. This game does kind of remind me of a kinder, gentler take on the Resident Evil series. Instead of shooting missiles at genetic mutant freaks and driving down zombies, you're punching security guards. And instead of blood and monster puss stained walls, everything is covered in neon. But the RE vibe is definitely there. It's a fun game and I recommend it.",

It combines a number of scenarios and games as far as setting and gameplay are concerned. The envrinoments remind of Deus Ex, the combat and upgrade system is very close to the Batman Arkham series (memory restructuring equals 'Detective Mode' etc.), it also has something from Dead Space as far as the camera angles and mechanics are concerned, and of course there's a side of Assassin's Creed with perhaps a pinch of Tomb Raider.  This does make for a great combo. The game itself is quite linear (meaning not open world), but the pace and storytelling are very compelling, and you don't mind the linearity of it at all. The various locations are introduced with a nice camera swoop, and the use of light and shadow does add drama.  If you are expecting a 'but', you're right. While the in-game combat very much reminds of the Batman Arkham games, the controls are not as fluid. The same goes for the usual walking around. The best way to describe the controls would be to say, 'a little clunky at times'. This is not a game breaker by any means, but I wish they would have chosen better camera angles, and that the movements felt more fluent, especially since the protagonist, Nilin, appears quite athletic and believably capable of all the moves without the 'superhero flair'. Another gripe I have are the boss fights, but that is the same for the Batman games. I find them unnecessarily complicated, and the overwhelming count of 'foot soliders' is just ridiculous at times. You can't click as fast as you ought to, but, with some practice and patience, you eventually get past all of them.  I have not yet completed the game at the time of writing this review, but I can already recommend it to anyone who liked the games I mentioned above, or simply enjoys a good game in a Sci-Fi setting that's neither improbable, impossible, nor too far in the future.",

The Combat seems rough at first but over time you realize how genius it is. Combo's become more than just button combinations, they become tactical. With certain combo buttons healing you, other doing extra damage and other granting cool-down on you special moves (S-Pressens) it becomes tactical to decide which combo to do next and how you want to build them. The game gives you many many questions and doesn't answer most of them until near the end. If I had to compare this to another game I'd call it a Character Action Deus Ex basically. The Cyber-Punk architecture layered throughout future Paris is woven together with the ancient structures of the past in a way that is beautiful. The main character is fantastically written as she doesn't just follow orders without thinking about the consequences but in the end she must follow them in order to regain her memories.  9.5/10",

The city of Neo-Paris has been throuroughly designed, with its architecture mixing past, current, and future elements. The result is a very plausible place, where you can feel both the frivolity of the rich an the despair of the poor.  The story itself, although it does not boast any big surprises, is pleasant, and cleverly written to talk about very contempary topics, using sci-fi elements. Heroes forgetting about their past has been used extensively in video games, but it is brought to another level here, and twisted with gameplay elements to make it actually believable and useful.  The gameplay is quite standard, with an interesting a-la-Batman combo-style combat system, and Darksiders-like powers to bring just enough fresh ingredients to make it interesting.  The memory remixing is a very good idea, but it could have been used a little bit more. As it happens here, the scope is limited, but still enjoyable.  If you go straight through the game, it will probably take you 10-15 hours to finish it. There is not much room for replayability unless you want to crack those achievements.  All in all, I recommend this game. It may not be the game of the year, but it is enjoyable and quite unique in its own way. The game could probably have used more marketing, too.",

I mean the healing it`s not that supreme at the begining of the game you are so easy to be killed by the enemy.  At least you can shout from a distance, that`s kindà cool. And yet the game isn`t that easy as it seems. Way much different that i had expected. It needs brain -&gt; strategy + to be aware of the numbers of enemies and always dodge their atacks. When they surround you .. you cannot even hit them, cause they`ll always stop you from doing atacks. Yeah yeah... you have skill that flashes them or stuns them for a while, but the cooldown is really big, and you cannot use both skills - like freeze them and use your punch arm. The story is really interesting. Once i started this game than i stopped it, don`t know why... - maybe too much raging on some missions .. just kiddin` .  Anyway this game deserves 10/10 - Graphics are really good, story line is interesting - various ways to defeat enemies - like for example more defensive and wait for time to use skills or just fight them and dodge non stop almost, which is kindà not cool. Hmmm it`s good that you cannot jump - i mean die while you do the climbing because she isn`t goin to jump when there is no shown spot to do it - which is really great. She is a really good climber. The sounds are great tho. Nilin is always communicating with the others. You can always guess the ways which you must go or you should go. Too bad it isn`t open world to get all the stuffs you didn`t collect, but hey who cares - it`s your choice.   You should get this game if you are interested in that kind of fighting system. Also that female story is great - because she is ' God of Destruction ' . Can get so much information from the others and even kill them, at least some of them. You are a real ' Mind Reading Hunter ' - Killer for example, cause there are many bad guys.  I think that`s all i can say. Oh and yeah enemies to be easy !? - That`s not even true. It always depends on how you fight them. Improve your skills than fight them again.",

            "review_text": "Remember me is a game that manages to still be fun and worth my time even when it has some critical flaws.   I'll start with the biggest flaw: to many enimies. This would not be a problem if you were able to attack more than one foe at a time, but that is not the case. In a game that has such a strong focus on making your combos have useful effects it is really sad that it is rare to complete a combo. You will have to dodge an attack from some other dude before you can complete the combo you crafted that heals your character as well as lowers the cool down on other abilities. I ultimately just made all my combos three or four moves instead of the eight or so moves possible in some of the combos. The fact that there was no way to really do crowd control without your special abilities (which have a cool down timer after use) really just made the millions of crowds this game threw at you annoying. Fights were awesome when it was one on three or even one on four reasonable enemies, but once hoards of leapers came in or guys who when you hit them electicuted you, the fun left and was replaced by tedious dodging and little jabs here and there. I turned down the game difficulty towards the last hour just so I could use my combos without worry.  But I did manage to have a good time with this game. Despite the flawed combat, it was sometimes still really fun, especially when using special powers or performing takedown moves. All your powers in this game look like cubist modern art and it's so awesome. Boss battles were fun as well, while not on the caliber of Metal Gear Rising, still nice multistaged fights in some really slick environments.  Neo Paris is just such a well realized world. Orange lights just are glowing everywhere surrounded by urban decay except for in the richest part of town with the pure blue skies and pristine clean buildings. It helps that the graphics are just dazzling. The port is very solid without framerate hitch or stutter even once with everything cranked up all the way with to many enimies on the screen. I played this game to explore this city. To do genaric style 'grab the ledges and poles' platforming over a destroyed factory with that orange glow under my feet. To fight to many enimies in a dream esc cubist world inside somebody's head.  One more aspect of this game that kept me coming back was the plot. While the story wasn't perfect, the main character was well written and was forced to explore a lot of moral grey area. A lot of the really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ things you do end up helping you, and never bite your ♥♥♥. The plot does not stick to karma in a boring way most videogame plots tend to do, but rather just tells a mostly realistic-ish story with realistic-ish results for the character's actions. Also, the plot is closely tied with these segments called 'remixes' in which you change a person's memory. While they don't happen that often, when they do it is a real treat. They tell good little stories and just let you play around with variables to change the end. Of course there is a desired set of variables, but I had fun playing with the wrong ones and seeing what happened. It was a cool mechanic.  So overall, the gameplay is the worst part of this game really, which should be criminal. But somehow, the super slick polish and the smart story won me over. Who-woulda-thunk?",

This is by no means a bad thing; it adds to the character of the game, and the references to the French Revolution (La Bastille) are a nice, albeit overt, touch. However, it may have had a negative effect on the game - I don't know if it was lost in translation or if it was just the way it was written, but the game's attempts to have shocking and reality-altering revelations fell a little short. That being said, the story is captivating and made me want to play if only to find out what happens next. In addition to a solid plot, the game is quite stunning. The level design is original and the cinematics are beautiful. Playing through a level is a mix of Assassin's Creed parkour, Arkham-Asylum-like combat, and a Bioshock kind of atmosphere, all with a soundtrack that complements the fast-paced feel. There's even the occasional puzzle. Clearly, this game has a mix of everything, which kept it refreshing and entertaining.

It was fairly straightforward but kept me entertained the whole time. You don't waste time fighting through hordes of endless enemies, to win you must strategize how to beat the current battle. If you find yourself breezing through every battle then you should make sure you are on the hardest difficulty. When I lost a battle it's because my strategy was off, not my mechanics.

            "review_text": "Quick Summary: Third Person Action game in a semi-dystopian world with intriguing story, but some buggy gameplay. The combat is mostly hand to hand with a simplified “combo” system where you alternate between punches and kicks. Overall it’s a fun game and makes you think about the benefits and drawbacks of memory manipulation.  You play Nilin, a “memory hunter” in a world where technology now allows the storage and deletion of human memories. Unlike the “Total Recall” movies, the technology can’t really make up new memories and implant them into people. Instead, it’s possible to selectively delete memories and/or remove them from people and give them to someone else. As a memory hunter, Nilin is able to do a whole lot of unusual things such as steal passwords from a person’s mind, “remix” memories, and use cyber power attacks in combat.  The game is mostly linear with a lot of free climbing like Assassin’s Creed or Tomb Raider games, and the combat is similar to the brawling in the Batman Arkham games or Sleeping Dogs. However unlike Batman, Nilin doesn’t “counter” attacks, only dodge. Also, note that unlike the Arkham games the reaction time is shorter (You pretty much have to dodge as soon as you see an attack warning). The combo system I mentioned earlier is based around unlocking punches and kicks as you “level up.” These attacks can be chained into 3, 5, 6, or 8 hit combos which do increasing damage as they get longer. This is why the short reaction time to enemy attacks is so annoying (they keep interrupting combos). Other special powers you can unlock throughout the story are Fury (short term damage boost), DOS (area effect stun), Logic Bomb (area affect damage) along with a couple others.   Pros: +A unique and complex world with a thought provoking story line. +The boss battles are interesting because of cyber manipulation of virtual worlds based around memories. +The “memory remix” sections of the game let you view and make subtle changes to a person’s memory, with the overall effect of making them remember things that never happened. It’s like the butterfly effect in action, tiny changes can change the outcome in drastic ways.  Cons: -The game has some noticeable bugs, like the sound suddenly cutting out, or not being able to aim your spammer “gun” at various points in the game. -The combat system is really annoying when you’re surrounded by enemies and can’t get a combo going because everyone keeps attacking. In the Batman games, the enemies usually attack one at a time (or you can use a multi-takedown). In Remember Me, you have to dodge and start your combo over.  You probably have Remember Me from the Humble Bundle last year so don’t be afraid to give it a shot.",

Overall, though, I would absolutely suggest it to anyone who fancies science fiction (particularly post-cyberpunk), mysteries and just plain old thrillers. Everyone talks about the memory remixes, so I am going to skip those in this review. Really, they are fantastic exposition and they are all truly heartwrenching, and messing with the outcomes yields both achievement and wistful ponderings about what could have been achieved with them. The remixes are a neat mechanic, but they are few and serve as little more than getting to know a major character's background better before the story continues rolling along.  The game has got a lot going for it in the presentation department. The graphics and animations are wonderful to behold, and the world of Neo Paris is a sensational delight. Everywhere you look you see details lovingly ingrained into the surroundings. The game has no doubt about its settings or its style, and very rarely does a game deliver fully on its concept art, but Remember Me is one of those that does so and doesn't look back. Some of the boss fights have the most exhilerating visuals in gaming from 2013. And the soundtrack? The soundtrack ebbs with dark rhythms and soaring, mournful orchestral bits. The best pieces, however, blend the two into a single thrilling, heart-pumping thread.  The combat is fluid and features combo sets that you create from individual moves—kicks or punches—that you unlock as the game goes on. You can build for sustaining yourself by using regeneration pressens ('pressen' is just the game's terminology for 'move'), or strength by using power pressens. In the end you'll have, I think, five combo sets to tinker with and customize, each one longer than the last. Getting the timing down so that you're flowing from one combo to the next without a break is immensely satisfying and almost a bit like a rhythm action game, except you're getting pressure from incoming attacks and special enemies as well. Boss fights are interesting, with phases and gimmicks, and they will keep you engaged. However, if you fail a QTE during the coup d'grace phase, you will have to go back to the regular boss fight phase until you manage to nail down that QTE. A minor nuisance, or major depending on how one feels about QTEs in general.  The story itself, however, is the reason you will enjoy this game. The main character, Nilin, is a memory hunter—a criminal hacker who specializes in stealing people's memories through the digitizing implant known as a Sensen. Sensen technology has basically rewritten the rules of the world because now, people could actually opt into amnesia and get rid of their painful memories, preserve their favorites as if they were video clips, and share subjective experiences with others. which itself could usher in a new age of empathy. But Sensen in turn is also applicable in truly horrific ways, which is why the Errorist movement exists—they wish for an end to Memorize and its Sensen technology. The story involves both the quest to end Memorize and its peripheral agencies' abuses, and a personal side in which Nilin seeks to rediscover the person she actually was. When you join Nilin, she has zero recollection of her past, and herein is her personal motive for fighting forward. The endgame is truly riveting, and I would recommend this game for that alone.  However, I must now get to the downsides, that mixed bag I mentioned earlier. Targeting in combat can get hairy when there are many targets on screen, and you will rarely ever fight just one. All I have to say is good luck hitting the guy you intended on hitting, as there is no indicator of who Nilin is targeting at any given moment.  The platforming is super linear; you will not get the chance to explore often, and even if you do it is for scarce more than 20 feet down a different hallway or alleyway. Those who intend on collecting every collectible are further warned that the game loves to shut down backtracking by making it impossible, so it would be wise to take it slow if you intend on getting every bit of lore and power up. Overall, it makes you wonder why they even bothered with giving Nilin the ability to climb and jump all over the environment when the ways you can go are essentially predetermined with context-sensitive hints.  Speaking of hints, there is no way to turn them off. Even at the highest difficulty, you will be assailed with constant handholding. This is by far my biggest complaint about the game, that and the linear exploration.  For me this is a give-or-take, but cutscenes. There are a lot of them. If you dislike your gameplay frequently getting interrupted for a bit of exposition, prepare to be annoyed. It is nowhere near the level of Metal Gear Solid 4, with its behemoth 30-minute minimovies, but some of them can run a bit on the long side. For me, I was so eager to see what came next that it rarely bothered me.  In conclusion, I deem Remember Me a flawed gem—a truly rare and personal story that also rewards on every level with its art direction and fabulous orchestral-electronic soundtrack, brought down by flawed controls, a lazy camera, and little replayability. I happily recommend this game to lovers of cyberpunk, slick, stylish combat; and existential horror whenever it's in the $10-15 range.",

            "review_text": "Remember me is a game that manages to still be fun and worth my time even when it has some critical flaws.   I'll start with the biggest flaw: to many enimies. This would not be a problem if you were able to attack more than one foe at a time, but that is not the case. In a game that has such a strong focus on making your combos have useful effects it is really sad that it is rare to complete a combo. You will have to dodge an attack from some other dude before you can complete the combo you crafted that heals your character as well as lowers the cool down on other abilities. I ultimately just made all my combos three or four moves instead of the eight or so moves possible in some of the combos. The fact that there was no way to really do crowd control without your special abilities (which have a cool down timer after use) really just made the millions of crowds this game threw at you annoying. Fights were awesome when it was one on three or even one on four reasonable enemies, but once hoards of leapers came in or guys who when you hit them electicuted you, the fun left and was replaced by tedious dodging and little jabs here and there. I turned down the game difficulty towards the last hour just so I could use my combos without worry.  But I did manage to have a good time with this game. Despite the flawed combat, it was sometimes still really fun, especially when using special powers or performing takedown moves. All your powers in this game look like cubist modern art and it's so awesome. Boss battles were fun as well, while not on the caliber of Metal Gear Rising, still nice multistaged fights in some really slick environments.  Neo Paris is just such a well realized world. Orange lights just are glowing everywhere surrounded by urban decay except for in the richest part of town with the pure blue skies and pristine clean buildings. It helps that the graphics are just dazzling. The port is very solid without framerate hitch or stutter even once with everything cranked up all the way with to many enimies on the screen. I played this game to explore this city. To do genaric style 'grab the ledges and poles' platforming over a destroyed factory with that orange glow under my feet. To fight to many enimies in a dream esc cubist world inside somebody's head.  One more aspect of this game that kept me coming back was the plot. While the story wasn't perfect, the main character was well written and was forced to explore a lot of moral grey area. A lot of the really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ things you do end up helping you, and never bite your ♥♥♥. The plot does not stick to karma in a boring way most videogame plots tend to do, but rather just tells a mostly realistic-ish story with realistic-ish results for the character's actions. Also, the plot is closely tied with these segments called 'remixes' in which you change a person's memory. While they don't happen that often, when they do it is a real treat. They tell good little stories and just let you play around with variables to change the end. Of course there is a desired set of variables, but I had fun playing with the wrong ones and seeing what happened. It was a cool mechanic.  So overall, the gameplay is the worst part of this game really, which should be criminal. But somehow, the super slick polish and the smart story won me over. Who-woulda-thunk?",

Genre: Action Adventure, Platformer  Alright, let me get all of the puns out of the way first.   While Remember Me does have some memorable moments, a sound track that won't get out of your head, and an environment that sticks out in your memory, the combat was utterly forgettable and left me nostalgic for other fighting games.   *Ahem*  With that out of the way, you play as Nilan, a girl who's forcably lost memory of who she is, but is saved from having her mind completely wiped thanks to a mysterious figure named Edge. He belongs to a group called the Errorists, people determined to cleanse a society that uses memories as a form of tradable commodity, and experiments with memory itself to produce a stable, segregated city. As you venture through the game, you come across the nightmares of such experimentation and ultimately begin to take part in the most fun aspect of the game --remixing memories of certain people you come across and changing elements of what they recall to get them to join your cause.  It's really hard for me to figure out the kind of game Remember Me is trying to be. It gives this rich and interesting world but confines you to a linear path. It develops a wealth of interesting characters, but such flat development that at times feels forced. It tries to put together a unique combat system, but with such simple mechanics, most matches devolve into acrobatic button mashing. The coolest element of the game, memory remixing, doesn't happen nearly enough for it to hold the game up on its own. The worst part about it is a certain amount of pretentiousness with how it knows it's an artsy, smart game. Still, the music and atmosphere are astounding, and I have to give credit where it's due --it's a damn good story. Just wish the other elements had more thought put into them.",

        {
            "review_text": "Remember me can be best described as an hybrid between a fighting and a platformer game. Developed by Dontnod Entertainment, it takes place in a futuristic version of Paris (known in the setting as Neo-Paris) from year 2084, where a new technology, the Sensen, has allowed men and women to influence their own memories and store or even cancel them as they please. The protagonist, Nilin, is a memory hunter, a woman capable of interfering with the others' minds easily. The beginning of the game shows Nilin suffering a severe case of amnesia and finding herself into a terrorist group seeking to destroy the Sensen and free Neo-Paris. The story of Remember Me therefore revolves around Nilin trying to recover her memories back.  The main beef of the game is about navigating the various levels and survive the fistfights you are thrown in at times. Nilin is very agile and can get a good grip on many edges and jump between them easily: that's where the platform elements come from. There are always little visual clues on screen to tell you exactly where you should jump or hang on next. As the game progresses you'll be asked to overcome some small stealth sequences (there are sometimes patrolling droids that will instantly kill you if you get in their range) and puzzles: as Nilin acquires more skills you'll have to use them all to carve your path. Remember Me also features a really large collection of collectables items, which unlock concept art and 3D models in the main menu: some of them are hinted at during gameplay with some sort of maps, but the majority of them are incredibly well hidden and my require more walkthroughs to find.  The combat in Remember Me is your usual fighting game fare: you must achieve combos on enemies for massive damage while being careful to dodge the attacks thrown at you. The game features an unique combo system: the in-game menu allows you to actually build your own combos, deciding how many hits each must contain and what each hit may actually do (while some hits just damage the enemies, others may heal you, for instance). Nilin can also use special attacks and temporary boost called Sensens: they are available after achieving enough focus and have different results (using some of them become mandatory to overcome some bosses). Many enemies in Remember Me can't be really taken on using sheer force and require special attacks or strategies first. While this element always keeps on your toes, on later level such enemies become more and more common and therefore more and more frustrating (they are also always escorted by lesser mooks who will disrupt your combos, making your job even harder). The game also features four boss battles, each with its unique flavor and rather challenging too.  An unique gameplay element from Remember me are the Memory Remix sequences, which are more akin to an adventure game: you are presented with someone's else memory and have to change some particular details in order to change the ultimate outcome and proceed. Such sequences aren't that hard to overcome and are mostly trial and error in nature.  It's also worth mentioning that the presentation in this game is absolutely gorgeous: the landscapes are very faithful to Paris itself and well crafted; the enemies design is original and extremely detailed; the soundtracks makes a great job at enhancing the overall mood.  It can be argued that Remember Me tries to throw in many elements from different genres and doesn't manage to produce something truly unique for itself and the story could had been made far better for the truly incredible setting, but I still find this game to be severely underrated and I'd advise pretty much everyone to try it out regardless",

What you have here is a neat cyberpunk setting where, as you might expect, new technologies that have great promise (in this case, the ability to alter one's memories) lead to the creation of a world that... isn't so good. There's this massive corporation that, through it's control of this new memory-altering technology, is able to use that to exert a great deal of influence upon society and undertake some really messed up experiments. You play as Nillin, who is a 'memory hunter' who is also to not only steal memories from other people, but to actually dig into their minds and change what they remember about them. It only happens about 4 times, but the memory altering is pretty cool as you try to find what you need to screw with in order to make a past event change - at least in the eyes of the person whose memories you are altering. I'd say the gameplay part of it kinda reminds me of Life is Strange, but... that's no surprise because it's the same devs who made both that and this game.  The rest of the gameplay consists of some simple platforming, punching people, and... boss fights. I'm no fan of platforming, but here it basically tells you where to go next so at least this time I didn't sit around scratching my head about what to do. The combat that you engage in regularly involves using combos (that you adjust yourself which is pretty cool) and some special abilities that you unlock throughout the game. And while the regular combat is pretty neat, the boss fights... basically are a dodge-fest as you wait for special ability cooldowns (though you can shorten those cooldowns via yer combos). It's easily the weakest part of the game for me. Oh yeah, and the fact that the cutscenes are unskippable is rather annoying and is keeping me from hunting down the rest of the achievements. &gt;_&gt;  So, overall? Yeah... this game is okay. The setting and story are competent, though a bit forgettable. The memory altering and combo building parts of the gameplay are pretty cool, but those have to share the same space as lame platforming and smelly boss fights. In other words... this would be a 'maybe' recommendation from me, but is going to end up with 'yes' because there is no such option.  If the setting sounds interesting, then I suppose you can pick this up and check it out. Have funs! :o",

In the nicer parts of Neo-Paris the enviroment has this polished clean look that adds to juxtaposition of the ramshackled slums and sewers. Overall graphically it is a very stunning game.  Now gameplay. There are few things to talk about here. One is combat mechanics. This game takes an interesting approach to melee Arkham like combat. It has customizable combos, which can be accessed and altered at any time through the Combos Lab. This is a really cool idea and I love the game even more for it. The second thing to talk about is the memory remix sections. This is where you remix a person's memory so that their perception of reality is shifted in one case turning enemy into ally. This is a part of the story and part of the more morally questionable aspect of the protagonist Nilin.  Lastly the story. I have to say I loved it. But then again I'm a huge fan of the Cyberpunk genre. If you don't like cyberpunk stories than you probably wont like this one. I thought is was a brilliant depication of a dystopian society masquerading as a utopia.   Last advise: If you plan to get this game use a gamepad. With these melee combo centred games I prefer to use a gamepad. It just feels better.",

YOu could play the first 20 mins of the game and that would be the whole game pretty much in a nutshell. Combat isnt very fun later on too because you pretty much get stuf with a 3 hit or 5 hit combo limit (as creating combos allow you to reduce the really bad cooldowns on abilites they you more or less need to use in every fight later on, regenerate health because enemies wont let you hit someone 2-3 times at once without trying to hit you and breaking your combo which makes the larger 7 and 9 combo limits rather useless), Also all the boss fights in this game are exactlly the same and that usualy involves fighting the exact same trsh/enemies you already fought before until your cooldowns reset over and over. Everything excluding the bad combat it nice though....maybe worth it when its cheap. Also dont even bother standing in a small space when you're on combat...the camera starts to feak out so good luck seeing where you are... D:",

Puzzles and platforming exist but are not extremely arduous.  The story is tol from the point of view of Nillin, who has a lot of interesting qualities. I really like that she reacts to situations in a reasonable manner. When she jumps down a flight of stairs she stumbles and cries out, because she just jumped down a flight of 10 stairs.  Graphics are beautiful, the game runs great on my machine and is bug free. Controls are gernerally intuitive.  The most interesting idea in this game is the memory remixing. Altering people's memories to change the way they feel currently feels exactly like cheating. One of the first times you do it, an enemy becomes a friend. It is awesome.  Sometimes the fighting feels clunky, which I think is part of the design. Everytime you mess up her combos the music stops to let you know that you have messed up. This is great but it feels like her combos are more often messed up than not. I just came from playing Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor and the combat there is much smoother.  Overall I would reccomend this game to anyone that enjoys Dystopian Science Fiction, or action games in general.  7/10",

            "review_text": "I would like to recommend 'Remember me' not so much as a game but more as an interactive story. 'Remember me' has as central concept the idea that one can extract memories, insert them and even alter them. Being fan of Philip K.♥♥♥♥(duh, his surname gets hidden),it made me think of his story 'We can remember it for you wholesale' that has inspired the movie Total Recall. In this story a man wants to have the memories of a trip to Mars as a secret agent... of course the memories turn out to be true( or do they)?.  Manipulating memories is the special skill of Nilin, the protagonist. She is part of a resistance movement that fights against the organisation Memorize that has turned manipulating memories into a way to control people(portrayed as helping them), ignoring the suffering this causes. For too much of anything is harmful and so is too much of manipulating memories. The victims turn eventually into leapers who are, of course, hostile and linger, of course again, in the sewers of the dystopian Neo-Paris contemplating nastiness.  As Nilin you escape the Bastille into the sewers fighting your way through leapers and then work you way up for a final confrontation at the top of a building in Neo-Paris.  During the game you have various opportunities to alter people's memories. Some of these alterations (one of which involves the death of a child) are pretty cold hearted, making me wonder about the morality of Nilin.  The game feels like Nilin's personal journey as almost every aspect of the story bears on her own past. This Nilin centered story gives the game a special emotional feel on the one hand, but also makes if feel limited on the other. It is as if we see Neo-Paris through the eyes of Nilin and hardly anything else. It made me feel emotionally attached to her, but also distanced me from the world around her.    I want to touch on some of the more negative aspects of the game/story.. I think if you like fighting games that this game is probably boring for you. With the exception of a two battles, one against a super robot and another against two teleporting super leapers aided by a lot of normal leapers, can be special hard if you don't know how to handle them, but the other battles were mostly easy for me, so I suspect that veteran fighters will not break a sweat over them.. The fighting is done with combo's that you have to earn or find before you can use them. My experience is that with the harder fights you never get beyond a few combos because they have to be chained against the same target to count and since you have to jump around a lot to not get overwhelmed, targeting one and the same enemy for fair amount of time is not very likely. The only other thing you can do is stealing memories, but these are story like elements that are only triggered when the story wants you to and which you can not use as an alternative to fighting for instance. It would have been great if you could make a guard forget about you instead of having to kill him..  One of the problems I have with the story is that the most important issue is never dealt with, which is that while you might change a memory, this will not change reality.  An example. At one point Nilin manipulates the memory of a bounty hunter so she will aid Nilin instead of trying to capture her. It would be obvious that once this bounty hunter gets confronted with reality she must realize that her memories have been tampered with and thus turn her into an enemy again.  This difference between manipulating memories and the fact that reality will not be altered as well(let alone the memories of other people or simple: movies or other pieces of evidence) is never worked out in the game.  Also, as mentioned above, some of the memory altering that Nilin does causes people grief and this doesn't seem to affect Nilin much. Yes, Nilin ponders a lot about altering memories and what that causes, but she doesn't seem to connect this to her own actions. Or at least that is how I experienced it. She lacks a certain empathy for her victims.  In the end I would recommend this game for anyone who likes an involving story set in a dystopian world with some pretty visuals and good atmosphere. I read they are planning a sequel; there is enough story to make one.",

This game tells a story.... what I think is a very good one at that. Typically gameplay is very linear with no real ability to explore the extremely detailed and awesome looking game world around you. But, this isn't just a walk in the park. Actually there's a lot less walking than you think. Much of it is somewhat similar to parkour with elements of climbing, running, and jumping along the edges and insides of buildings, machinery, and basically anything else that has a handhold. There are also a number of fights along the way but they almost typically consist of mashing buttons until everyone is lying unconscious... with most of them, little strategy is involved. It does also have unique gameplay elements involving Nilin's ability to remix memories... those parts are extremely fun and interesting.  I am in love with the futuristic game world that was created for this game. Truly top notch. Again, it's a shame the developers don't give you more of a chance to explore it.  The soundtrack is also quite excellent. This isn't just some synthesized music produced by an audio technician either. It's performed by a philharmonic orchestra.  The voice acting is also excellent. I thoroughly enjoyed all the characters and their voice acting really brought them to life.  And then there's Nilin.... Ahhhh Nilin. Probably one of the sexiest, sultriest, best animated female protagonists in all of gaming. I really do think the choice of Kezia Burrows was bang on here to voice her. With her accent she really does portray Nilin as being strong, having an air of sophistication to her as well... almost like a female James Bond.

Most of the game is basically jumping and moving around to the next destination. From time to time the player will get attacked by enemies and will forced to fight in an enclosed area. When the player is attacked she can use combos, that are somewhat customizable, and special abilities to win the battle. Both the fighting and platforming sections are easy and rarely provide a challenge. Additionally, the game also throws in some puzzles and a remixing memory mini-game.   PROS - Graphics / level Design : The city known as NEO- Paris is stunningly beautiful and well designed - Story: The story is somewhat interesting. However, I do feel that it left a lot of plot holes by the end of the game. - Gameplay: Different enemy variations and a somewhat good combo mechanic make each fighting section enjoyable.  - Audio: The best part of the game is the music.  Cons - Action / Character development: Most of the characters in the game with the exception of the main character are not well developed. Also, the voice acting of most of the characters could have been a little better. However, the acting is not too bad.  - Customization system: The player can only customize what each hit, button press, of the combo does. Everything else is already determined.  - No exploration: There is no exploration what so ever. You have one route to follow and that is it.     RATING 7.5/10",

            "review_text": "I took the time to read the steam user reviews as well as the typical 'web' sources to get a good idea of what I was buying with 'Remember Me' from Capcom and Dontnod Entertainment. Knowing early that the storyline was being praised very highly while the gameplay less so, I questioned some perspectives from a casual gamers point of view. As a dad I rarely get time to finish anything, much less devote as much as I would prefer to gaming. It is with this in mind that I can 'Highly' recommend this game. My first impression was very strong. Solid story telling with superb presentation and execution is what you should expect. The action has been criticized as boring, repetetive and limited. I can't entirely disagree with this, but again I have neither the time to devote to perfecting the combo system devised nor finding every hidden object. It plays a tad like Batman Arkham mixed with Assassin's Creed (far less well thought-out might I add). Climbing in the game's environment feels alot like Assassin's Creed though far easier, VERY spelled out and limited/linear. Much more could have been done in the fighting and climbing engine, but again this isn't something that should deter one from the overall experience which just HAS to been seen to be believed.   I can't stress enough how impressive and atmospheric this game is. Produced with a painstaking level of detail, certain parts of the game will astonish you upon you're first visit to many of the locations. I would also like to recognize the music of the game and if asked, I would describe it as 'frantic but well paced'. The music sounds more like a top-notch movie rather than the typical techno/rock dredge offered up on a modern action game. 'Highly Recommended!'  ",

            "review_text": "Personal Rating: 'Grab it when on sale' Traditional Rating: 5/10 Genre: 3rd Person Action/Adventure Set in a dystopian future, players assume the role of Nilin, a 'Memory Hunter' who, ironically, has had her own memories stolen. Guided by the ever-present voice of Edge, the leader of the rebel group, Errorist Movement, Nilin must take down the Memorize corporation who, in controlling memories, effectively controls the population.   I'm a bit of a sci-fi junkie, and the premise surrounding Remember Me is an interesting one. The futuristic setting of Neo-Paris is beautifully crafted, with great contrasts between the slums and affluent areas of the city, which makes the very linear nature of the game much more apparent. Sadly, exploring just isn't an option.   The highlights of the game though, are definitely the 'Memory Remix' scenes, where players need to tweak certain aspects of a person's memory to alter it. Unfortunately, you're only presented with a handful of opportunities to attempt this, and I think the game would have been better if more of the focus was on remixing memories.   Aside from synaptic DJing, Nilin is also an adept hand-to-hand combatant, and the combat system does allow for a bit of tactical fun once all the combos and unique 'S-Pressen' moves have been unlocked. It's not exactly complex, but there is some added depth to the button mashing.   Overall, I think Remember Me is an enjoyable game, without being an innovative one. I'm glad I was off the mark with my initial assumption. I'd certainly recommend this to sci-fi fans, since the setting and story were part of the appeal for me. ",

Some elements (such as the large robots) could use a bit more explaining, such as why Nilin's father estranged himself from her by locking himself inside a giant cube. Small details like that. The options screen could use a bit of refining, like having graphics presets and putting the AA, VSync, Supersampling, and Shadow Quality inside an Advanced section.

Hacking someone's memory is the coolest thing to do in the game, I'll just say that.  I love how it portrays memories, which I think it does a wonderful job visualizing.  I think the success of this game suffers from the same thing games with premises hard to describe in one sentence. Psychonauts suffered from the same problem; it and this game are too non-mainstream to be massively profitable.

The female protagonist is certianly refreshing, though despite being a complete badass Nilin has about as much depth and complexity as the recently re-imagined Lara Croft (if not less); the reason for this being that she primarily interacts with herself and the brief moments she  does  have conversing with others are done via commlink and thus end up being rather impersonal.  The gameplay is mostly balanced between vertical platforming and combo-based 'beat-em-up' style combat. While the platforming doesn't really offer anything unique (missed opportunity if you ask me) it is handled quite well all the same. The combat, however, is part of what makes this game shine. Sure, on the surface it may not seem so different but the Combo Lab is quite a nifty innovation that allows you build your combos - and thus your play style - as you see fit. For each combo you unlock, you can mix and match moves (the actual button combinations are static) from various categories to build new and powerful attack strings; from power attacks to regen attacks and more.  The Memory Remix mechanic is also unique and quite interesting, though sadly doesn't see much use. What it does is let you view a person's memory and alter it by scrubbing it for memory leaks which can then be manipulated in various ways. For example: your first encounter with this power has you erasing the memory of an ill loved-one from the mind of a bounty hunter and therefor eliminating her motivation for wanting you dead.  The graphics are pretty solid and Neo-Paris is simply stunning - from it's towering heights to the murky bowels of the undercity below. Voice acting was really well done, even if the actual writing behind it often left something to be desired; Kezia Burrows (voice of Nilin) does a particularly awesome job. Music is halfway decent, too.",

Everything in the game is really well polished and it is a pleasure to look at. It looks really modern and sci-fi without being too far fetched. The art canvas that are unlocked as you play the game are stunning and a good reward for the play through. Congratulations for the artists and designers for these.   With regards to the story, I found the story at times captivating, at others (and most of the time, really) to be a bit obvious. But what I found most interesting was the philosophical discussions and the struggle of the main character when she is still recovering her memory. Having said that, the whole story is very linear.   These two points for me were the highlights. Now, some parts of the game that could improve.  Although I found the mechanic of allowing you to create your own combos, however limited, it was interesting enough to the point that changing it during a battle could prove very helpful. Having said that, I found the battles to be a bit repetitive and fairly easy. Once you get the mechanic of an enemy or a boss, even on the hard difficulty, it was still fairly easy.   With regards to the puzzles like climbing walls, jumping at ledges, climbing pipes, etc, it was a bit simplistic and at times rather frustrating, because as the game is not open world sometimes there were inconsistencies where you can leap up 4 meters from ledge to ledge and sometimes you cannot climb a 2 meters wall where you KNOW there is something behind it. And for me, the most frustrating part was when I was looking for an item (such as health or focus) and because of the linear part, you end up exploring a bit in order to reach the item, which would involve entering rooms to check it out. But if you happen to enter a room that was going to move the story forward, sometimes the door would just close behind you and would not allow you to go back, hence, you will lose the opportunity to get the item. Unless you play the whole game again, because there is only one save slot and the game auto-saves.   The memory remix mini-games were quite interesting, although, it is fairly simple to deduce how to solve, or if you are feeling like exploring the alternatives, just try everything, it won't take long for that and might have some interesting side-effects. These parts are very surreal which, again, congratulations to the art team.   Overall, for me it was an interesting game and experience, but it felt like a one trip pony, i.e. once you play once, it's enough. The replayability of the game is fairly low, because the second time you play, there won't be much novelty, with the exception of getting the missed items because of locked doors behind you.",

Combat is like an 'Arkham City wanna-be' but comes nowhere near the fluid motion of any of the Batman games. But if you can get past the first few levels and upgrade your combos it's not so bad. Actually once I quit trying to play it like Arkham and started playing it for what it was, I started to come around to the combat and enjoy a tad bit. There are also plenty of platforming moments that are all pretty easy. They mostly serve to break up the gameplay and show off a wider view of the levels, and let me tell you.....The world of Remember Me is the reason you want to play this game. When you move from point A to B don't RUN...hold back on the thumbstick a bit and WALK and soak in every bit of the detail. These guys have made one of the most beautiful games I have ever seen in my life. The level to detail is staggering and is Remember Me's greatest asset. That being said, I do wish they would have went the Splinter Cell route instead of the Arkham City route and had more focus on stealth. This could have been the Starcraft Ghost that we never got. Can you imagine?!?!? Oh well, it's still a beautiful game and well worth a playthrough, especially if your a little burnt out on the same ol', same ol' Call of Duty or whatever mainstream game that usually takes up your time. Do yourself a favor and give it a chance. It doesn't cost much and worse case scenerio you just don't like it.

She becomes distraught and wheepy because in this little tid-bit of memory she litterally hacks a guy's memories so harshly that he eats a bullet in front of his wife. Pretty horrible thing to have to remember to be sure. I think we can all feel her on this point. I mean, if someone handed me a flashdrive that I then uploaded to my brain and this ♥♥♥♥ was on there... well I'd have a moment. But the little tiny eensy weentsy issue I have with this is that the main character gets all wheepy about this just after she single handedly depopulates a slum with her bare hands. Like kills 50 people with her ♥♥♥♥ing bare hands...  So ya, a little illogical. But still... we can brush by such little oddities and lavish in the rich gameplay (which it has in spades), the amazing environments (awesome), and the badassness of it's combat engine.  I like this game a lot.... a lot a lot. If I have any criticism at all it's in the shortness of the game. It might last about 12 to 15 hours total gameplay tops.",

The story is interesting, but unremarkable, in contrast to the graphics which are impressive, but underservered by the very linear levels. The game has a nice variety of enemies, of varying [imposed] difficulties, that seem to exist more to draw out the limited gameplay, rather than as a real challenge (I'm looking at you Elite Enforcer!).  But it is the controls that will be your greatest foe in this game. They are, at best, dodgy, and at worst (particularily when trying to target a particular enemy with ranged attacks), unresponsive. Boss fights will require a peek at a walkthrough to understand what you are supposed to be doing, but it's the mass fights in increasingly confined spaces that will cause you to walk away from the game, thanks to the inaccuracy of the controls.  The idea of remixing memories is interesting, but only occurs a few times in the game, and is as logical as a '90s Sierra game, and will probably come down to trying random combinations, or just looking at a walkthough. It's not a bad game, but has too many problems to be more than a decent game. Buy it on a sale if the graphics appeal to you.",

I'm not having any difficulty playing this with mouse and keys, but some may prefer the controller. First boss battle was not overly difficult, but challenging enough to feel a sense of triumph when succeeding.  The environment is stunning. Rich, full of detail and ambiance. The pace of the story is good, I'm only a few hours in as of this writing and I feel drawn in. The first 're-write' of a persons memory...what a great way to handle it. From the mouse input feeling so natural to 'scrub' through the memory timeline, to the great visuals...very well done.  Traversing the environment is not anything super-amazing, but it's well done enough and handled decently. Your moves are executed confidently and appear natural and smooth. This is not 'Mirror's Edge' so don't expect over-the-top parkour. Your acrobatic moves during combat will make up for it.  Combat may at first appear shallow, but there is some depth to be found for the patient seeker. Finding your pace and timing in combat feels really good when you get into the groove. Evading, flipping over an opponent to continue a chain, rapidly switching targets to maintain control all feel rewarding. Winning a fight against multiple opponents feels like an accomplishment, not just the result of random button mashing.  I always reccomend watching gameplay videos and watching/reading plenty of reviews before making a decision to purchase. Chances are, if you like the dystopian/cyberpunk genre, this game will appeal to you.  It goes without saying, people are different, they like different things. Some will hate this game, some will love it and others will be ambivalent. I can only say that I'm having a lot of fun playing it, and I think it's an experience worth your time and money. Some may disagree, but in my opinion this game is an underrated gem and I'm glad I picked it up.  Thanks for reading, and Good Gaming.",

Remember Me has style for sure however when it comes to one of the most central parts of the game: the combat, it falls short.  I wouldn't recommend playing with mouse and keyboard if you have a controller, I played with an xbox controller and even that felt clunky. The combat is frustrating for a number of reasons, there is no Lock-on feature when fighting, the only lock on is for your ranged weapon.   Dodging is awkward and a little buggy sometimes you can find yourself stuck in a dogpile of enemies if you do not compensate for that eventualilty.   The combos can be really hard to pull off even though they aren't that complex buttonwise, the problem is when fighting multiple enemies one always sneaks in a jab and breaks your combo, you can dodge and resume the combo but the time you're given to do so is very short.   The combo editing system had the potential to be really awesome mixing and matching damage, health regen, cooldown reset and multiplier moves however it simply isn't mainly because a jack of all trades combo set isn't good at anything and you are much better off focusing one of the four sets soley to do damage or regen health ect.  7/10.

Remember Me doesn't do that quite as well as Tomb Raider did, in my opinion, but it's certainly not a title to miss. The story, is good. Cheesy, but good. Graphically, this game is gorgeous. The set pieces are astounding, and the art and camerawork, mix with the music to give a very Scifi Movie vibe. This art direction and music direction are very consistent throughout the entire game.   Nilin the Memory Hunter   Speaking of the music, Remember Me features dynamic fight music. Landing a combo successfully on an enemy will cause the music to play louder and more naturally, while getting hit, or losing too much health will cause it to degrade to just the basic beat, or sound like it's 'glitching out'. This creates a sort of reward for doing well, and when the music starts hitting it's high points, and you're on a roll, it feels amazing. The music is on a whole other level. It's a mix of Classical string and brass with digital beats and Synth effects. It comes off as epic, and distorted but in such a way that it accentuates the story.   Madame Fight   And now about the combat... I feel the combat is good. There are a few things that cause me to dislike fighting in the game, but it's mostly just annoying enemy types, or too many enemies attacking at once. If I had to sum up the combat in this game I'd say it's like Batman's but the enemies don't wait, or take turns. For some, this is great, and it seem more realistic, but from a gameplay perspective, I feel it adds unneeded frustration.   The Fight   You play as Nilin, a Memory Hunter, who's memories, ironically, have been stolen. You wake up in a lab, and someone from your past, named Edge, is trying to help you escape being turned into a human vegetable. The story is dark, and while much of it can be seen from a mile away, I felt there were a few good twists here and there. Some of the acting is a bit cheesy, but I'm usually a fan of cheesy acting, and storylines.   Combat Music   The setting is Neo Paris. Pretty much what would happen if Paris became Taris from Knights of the Old Republic. Grungy under-city, and posh higher society areas create a contrast-heavy universe where it's never hard to tell where you are. Things in the environment feel lived in as well as alive. Beams. shutters, pipes, holographic screens, people, wind. Everything is animated, and feels like it's right where it belongs. The lighting is another thing of note. This is one of the prettier Unreal Engine games of last gen. It seems like the developers, even though fairly new, had a deep understanding of UE.   Title Theme   If you're in the mood for a dark, scifi game with a pretty unique and engaging setting, then I would say this is 100% for you. The developers put a lot of work into this one, and it deserves far more than what it got in sales. It's not perfect, but it's great.   Our Parents   Afterthoughts:  I want another game in the same vein, or even in the same world of Remember Me. Neo Paris is just too cool and the vibes I get from the music are intense. It's the perfect playground for a Deus Ex-style game. ;)",

Most people say that they feel this could have been done more in the game, but each remix is quite lengthy so I didn't feel like this needed more attention. It was great fun whilst you did it and well paced. But more important than that is that the story and setting are absolutely fascinating. Killer soundtrack too. Very relatable lead character and the fact that she has total amnesia at the beginning really makes the arc of the story alot more intriguing, as you are discovering more and more interesting twists (which are abundunt in this game).

This game, however linear, straps you to your seat and proceeds to remix your very own brain. The story alone has the power to generate one of the best movies that could ever come out of Hollywood; in saying this, I believe the negative comments about linear gameplay can be explained. With explaination these comments lose any basis regarding one's decision to buy or not. The game is in many ways an all encapsulating movie, minus the cut scene jibber, and just like any movie, no matter the greatness, it takes time to reload another go around. Knowing the things I do now I both recommend Remember Me and whole heartedly believe it is well worth full price.",

The combat system is implemented well and does have unique elements to it. There are different types of attacks that do different actions. For instance, you have attacks, when connceted, heal you. You have attacks that will decrease your cooldown for special attacks and so on. The combat is very smooth. A good parallel would be the combat from the Batman Arkham games but with more customization.   The graphics are beautiful and really rich in atmosphere. I really had no complaints with them. Speaking of atmosphere, there are little things, such as retractng shop signs when you get close to them and little packs you can collect to learn more about the history that really enhance the game.  Audio is amazing. Voice acting is done well and you can really feel the emotions in the characters.  I read people had issues with the controls. I played with the XBOX 360 controller and had no issues. I don't know how the controls are on the keyboard, but I've heard that people have played it with mouse and keyboard without issues. Try both options if you can.  The storyline is what kept me playing through this game. There were just so many questions that needed to be answered and the game does wrap it up nicely in the end. The whole concept of memory management is amazing and implemented nicely in memory remixes, where you alter the memory of an individual. I don't want to ruin anything by saying more but the whole concept is flat out amazing and different.  Buy this game. It borrows elements from other games but also implements its own to provide an amazing package. We need more unique games like this and it all begins when you support them.   Truly worth playing from every angle.  P.S: It took me ~11 hours to complete the game but there is reason to go back, such as finding all the 'culture' packs and other collectibles.",

The way the music reacts to your fights is a nice feature. + Combat is imperfect but largely satisfying and the boss battles are all really cool and well-staged. + Memory remixing (Inception-like changing of people’s memories) is an original and well-implemented gameplay mechanic, but a little underused. + Frequent save points and a dynamic and immersive HUD that only shows when useful.  Negatives: - Extremely linear and on rails, to the extent that there are glowing markers telling you which ledge to grab or pipe to climb; this is a very closed-off world with nothing to explore or interact with. - Although the story is good, the dialogue and voice acting are both underwhelming. - The controls during climbing/platforming are a little fidgety. - The camera is passable, but I’ve seen much better in other games. - Some unnecessary shortcuts were made, such as having the TV screens showing still images instead of videos.",

The rest is on rails - tomb raider 'lite' sections have you jumping around but telling you where every move is. Odd choice? Then puzzle sections to tax you a little - mostly simple, but a few are really good riddlesque pieces - how puzzles should be.  The reason I bought this game was actually to see the memory remixing which looked interesting and different. Thankfully it was both... though possibly a little simplistic and maybe a little underused. Without saying too much, developers missed a trick with the final remix - they should have gone where I suspect most people would hope, but settled for keeping it simple - shame!   What is great is the art direction and wow.. the music is out of this world - patch that into pretty good story and it's worth a shot if you don't mind it being a little consoley... especially the checkpointing.

Pulling off a 8 hit combo because you have to or you'd die is pretty awesome when it works out, luckily it mostly does in this game.

Basically, positioning matters nothing in combat, as with a single press of the spacebar/a button (depending on keyboard vs controller) you dodge all incoming attacks and get a brief invulnerability to new ones (long enough to dodge again, if needed. Repeat. Boss fights are so far, hit or miss. I enjoyed the first two, while the third has an irritating quick time event that you must beat, in order to kill the boss. Fail? Boss gets some HP back, and you try again. After over an hour of tries, I have failed consistently on the 'Mash the A button quickly' portion of this quick time event, and normally have no other problems with 'button mashing contests'. So, overall, a decent game, but don't come into it expecting to use the cool 'rewind through people's memories and then alter them' mechanic that is so flauted in the reviews. I have two days of play into it, and have seen that admittedly fun mechanic once, and that was within the first hour of play.   TL;DR? Repetetive, dodge-based combat still manages to feel fun. Enemies are moderately varied, and robots provide nice breaks from 'Memory scramble kills everything' fights. Quick time events out the wazoo (Read: Every Boss Fight Ending) and the best part of the game seems to happen when you tinker with memories and try things out, but the game never actually LETS YOU DO THAT.  7/10.

There were many promises for the game to become a good game, as such as possibilities to become a bad one. What are we received at the end?  “Remember Me” draws your attention from the very beginning: design of the world itself and the music complement each other and fit into gameplay together, thus creating the experience of art. You hold your breath here and there, looking at those buildings, those clothes and etc. Olivier Derivière made a great work and found unique approach to the soundtrack, mixing digital and non-digital media into one being.   Storyline and dialogs, though, sometimes feel not so good, but they also don’t pretend to be a top-level “one-minute-before-award” scenario. And I can’t remember any of the moments now, so overall impression is quite good. I can say even that it was interesting to follow the progression and look at the new turns and moments of the game.  There was a lot of discontent about fighting system. Many say that it’s similar to the one from the Batman series. I don’t see, why. You have several available chains (only two from beginning) with a different length, into which you can build different moves with a different effects: damage, heal, recharger of supermeter and multiplier. And you choose what moves you want into concrete chain, so you can vary effects and strength of your combo. Also you have a supermeter that allows you to implement some special attacks. There is also a projectile weapon later in the game which adds some more variety. And again, music changes its pace and intensity as you succeed or fail. Together it leads to a simple mechanics of the fighting system, yet intensive and catching, memorizable battles, especially near the end of the game.  Another discontent is connected with one of the unique parts of the game — remixing of memory. There are just not too many of them. But from the other side there are enough to not to bother you with repetition; and all of them seem different and unique in comparison to each other.  Overall, I can say that “Remember Me” is a good game, a game for your enjoyment and relaxation that delivers a great mixture of simple, but not too easy, mechanics, design and music. Truly, gem of art, as it seems for me, though not without a drawbacks at all. If you don’t perceive games through eyes and ears but from logic only, you'll, probably, say otherwise.",

The views are breathtaking, you feel you're in a coherent universe, every detail is tailored to make you feel like you're in that cyberpunk-ish Paris, ... And the character development, while it's not the most fantastic I've ever seen, is really worked on and can really catch you. You can easily feel some empathy for that amnesiac girl who doesn't know what the hell is happening.   Some were critical about the gameplay itself. While it's no Arkham City, it's still pretty smooth and you quickly find yourself using various combos. It could have been more inspired, indeed, but all in all, it's far from bad. Actually, I'd see it more closer to a Skyrim than a Call of Duty. Not because it's an RPG like Skyrim, but because you don't only play Skyrim for the combat but also for the general ambience. Skyrim's combat system isn't so great, its main story isn't so great either, but that's not what you're looking for in Skyrim. Same goes here ! If you're looking for a great dystopian video game, you'll have what you want.  Bonus point for an actual good main female character. For once, it's not a friggin' bimbo, nor is it a poor lost princess, or some big hulk. It's a refreshing change.

The combat is hard (depending on difficutly ofcourse) and fun, the Sensen abilities (If you're familiar with League of legends you might call it your Ultimate Ability) are really awesome, they give you that advantage you need when you're in a tough pinch with a few Leapers (Humans that have lost their minds due to memory wipe) or Soldiers. 3. Parkour. It has its ups and downs, but its good anyway. 4. The Riddles and Puzzles. A riddle in the game made me ponder about it for about 20 min, that means its a pretty hard riddle if you ask me :D, The small puzzles are very fun to do and figure out how to complete. 5. You never get lost! (YAY). There's a simple waypoint marker showing you where to go and where to jump to get to the destinasion the easiest way.

Unfortunally this game is not open world, this was one of my most biggest dissapoitments. The game lets you play in an extremely narrow coridor. You sometimes have no clue why you are doing something or even what you are doing but the corridor is so small that you can't stumble in the wrong direction, doors lock right behind you if you pass them so you can't even move 2 ways in this corridor, it's a one direction road.   The combat is quite fun tho, you have some options concering your combos which will depend if you make it or not. The combos are really simple to change tho, even while doing a combo they can be changed so it gives you some room to play in, which if used to it's maximum can be devastating for your opponents.  The boss fights are quite hard from what I have experienced, tho I should add that I played on the hardest difficulty. Mistakes in a fight are not very forgiving, ex. You get knocked over reciving damage, and while getting up they shoot you or channel something in your direction making it impossible to dodge.  Memory changing missions are quite frustrating since it takes time and you have to do eveything over and over and try everything in different ways till you get the right combination of options.  The graphics are good/oke, nothing amazing but they do have alot of clutter/detail laying around so the levels don't seem empty.  The soundtrack is good, nice to listen to and nothing annoying, fits the scenes. Voice and other sound were done good, didn't notice anything really bothering.  The story is not bad, have had worse and have had better. The scenes you get are nice, especially from the city and all the people and robots doing their jobs and what not. Tho I do feel a bit of emptyness, you can't interact with any of them at all and most of the people/robots feel more like props than actual people or robots living their lives.  Overall the game is quite... special. Although I am not a rage kind of player this game had me taking a break at some times, so it's not for the few people that like to smash on the keyboard.   BUT I still recommend this game for some reason, Im glad to have played the game and will probably never play it again. Get it for the right price and you won't have to many regrets. 6.5/10",

Yes, this game is a bit dated in terms of graphics / effects, but honestly, I rather take a good game that has good art direction over new effects and some thrown-together assets any day.  The only drawback I had when playing, is that I had to play it in compatibility mode to fix the audio and there were some stuttering when loading models (like looking at the floor or transitioning to a new scene). But those are rare.  It's how I think a game should be. Good controls, good art style, interesting story, new game mechanics I haven't yet seen in another game and a well-designed UI.

Gameplay is entirely linear, leaving the player feeling more like they're just along for the ride rather than making meaningful choices, and while the storyline hints at some fascinating concepts, the exposition seems rushed and skims over much of the deeper context that really would have brought this world to life.

Great atmosphere and story with gameplay that is only kind of weak.  The visuals and setting are truly second to none. It is set in a crazy future version of Paris. The style ranges from a dripping rotten underground to a sterire futuristic magnificence. Every location could me a painting for all the subtile details and raw artistic effor put in. 10/10  The story is extremely good and well told. The world removes and adds memories to themselves at a whim. Think a combo of Eternal Sunshine and Total Recall. Some people have not fared well with this and have turned into brain damaged Gollum like creatures. You are an Errorist, sworn to take down the people resposible. Great characters and acting throughout. 9/10  The gameplay really breaks down into two elements.  First, is combat. It is a 3rd person beat-em up that functions a lot like Arkham. Except your combos are set into 4 specific ones, plus you have a dodge. Now, where it gets interesting is the effects you can attach to the combos. You can assign each button on each combo with a different perk. You can have it be strong, heal you, or reduce the countdown on your specials. Plus there's 5 different special attacks and your little gun-like thing. On the whole, it is a lot of great ideas, but it is fairly clunky until you get used to it and still clunky even then. 6/10  The other part is a lot of platforming which is pretty par for the course if you have ever played a game like Uncharted. Jumping, hanging, maneuvering around a space. Works well. But then there are these Memory Remix segments where you go into a person's head and alter one of their memories to suit your causes. This is possibly the best part of the game. You make small changes, like moving a table or releasing a lock, and they end up changing the scene entirely. These parts were so much fun. My only complaint is that there were not enough of them. 10/10  On the whole, this is a great game that you can get for pretty cheap that should chew up a solid 7-8 hours of your time. 8/10 Overall.",

Best to play it on easy to get the combat over with quickly, so as to return to enjoying the fantastic visuals.

            "review_text": "A friend of mine gifted me this game during a special sale. Who ever thinks that he might enjoy a combination of   a) a cyberpunk setting (futuristic, dystopian storyline) b) European architecture  c) and a combat system that purely relies on melee combat d) controls that are clearly based on xbox / playstation controllers  could find 'Remember me' to be an interesting addition in your Games Library.  For me, who actually likes 'open' games like Arma 3 to be best, the linear levels in 'Remember Me' were a little bit frustrating. Not going to tell you much about the story, but your 'equipment' tells you which way you need to go and there is practically no way ingame to take the wrong or another path. If there appears to be another route, then it will always lead to a backstreet with a hidden collectable item. This way of 'level design' goes through the whole game. The disadvantages are obvious for 'explorers' - on the pro side : the game feels alot more fluent and less frustrating. You can not get lost in this game - Your character and you always seem to have a plan of where to go next - like in a movie.   So I mentioned the level design on a conceptual level - but how about the acutal textures, objects and the 'immersion of the cyberpunk setting'? Oh, it's so beautiful. I can't remember the last time I was so blown away by the graphics. The first few minutes I thought 'Meh, looks okay but doesn't appear to be something special'. But the very moment you lay your eyes upon the ingame Paris - Oh my god. So beautiful, so many details, so much to explore (NOT in terms of going everywhere, but in terms of seeing what is around your linear level path).  The story and characters are okay - nothing super special apart from the game's setting in Europe. Judging from after I played through the game and knowing that it is very likley that there won't be a 'Remember Me 2' I'd say, that the characters and relationships develop too slowly and I still have many questions that were not answered at all. After taking a quick look into the Forums I did see that I wasn't alone.  Gameplaywhise I have mixed feelings: The game focuses on a melee combat system only. Apart from the story itself, you will never witness a gunfight or a gun in the hands of an enemy. Within the first hour of gameplay I found this a little bit boring. You're basically 'spamming' the A and B (Attack with Hand / Foot) the whole time. There are a few combos for your main character to learn (kind of similar to a Tekken character). You can not change these combos but you can change whether a certain kick or Hand attack within the combo deals extra damage, heals you or reduces the cooldown time for your special abilities. The special abilities also unlock within the progress of the game, each of them is different and apart from 1 ability, your really need them all during the different enemy encounters.  Sorry for not going much into detail but for me I like it most if someone doesn't tell you anything / too much about the story or certain parts of the game.   The soundtrack (music) is excellent. Nothing more to say here. There is one stage within the game that (for me personally) has a weak and repeating background music - for the whole rest, the boss encounters, the 'trashmobs' or the more silent / sneaky parts of the game, the music is absolutely fitting and a big PLUS for both, atmosphere and immersion.   So it took me about 12 hours to play through the game, I had mixed feelings about the story. Besides feeling satisfied, I felt like some things were never answered, some motives where unrealistic etc - yet I also felt like I played a game that in some way impressed me so much that I really needed to write this report about it.   I am in love with games like Deus Ex, Portal, World of Tanks, DSC, FSX, etc. I actually am not a fan of console based games and I instantly felt that this game was made with focus on consoles. It still was a welcome change .. even for a proud member of the PC Master Race Association. ;) Have fun guys. ",

            "review_text": "Ultimately enjoyable, but still left some things to be desired.  Having played (and loved) Life is Strange, and hearing that the rewind mechanic was based Dontnod's first game, i was excited to play it.  Aesthetically, the game is lovely. The soundtrack was incredibly unexpected, a huge, sweeping score that could easily be taken from a cyber-punk, Star Wars-esque cinematic opera. The city of Neo Paris is incredibly vibrant, multi-faceted, and really quite beautiful. The combination of these two as you step out of the tunnels and into Slum 404 for the first time was really a moment to behold, and combined with the background history and information that you aquire throughout the game, the world feels deep and absorbing. I desperately wish we could have seen more of it.  The story is very good too, although it sometimes feels like you're constantly changing direction and targets, with no overall goal in sight. This is entirely necessary for the story to play out the way it does, but it's not exactly the most compelling way to move a story forward; it feels very disjointed sometimes. The main character Nilin is sympathetic though (with some *stellar* voice-work) and the surroundings are great to just wander around sometimes. The calm of the Valet robots that look so human and continue to do their jobs cleaning/repairing/(whoring) as the world falls to crap is really entertaining.  Mechanics-wise, the memory remixes are fun, interesting puzzles that lead you to think about the wider ramifications of memories and their power, and you spend a lot of time climbing Tomb Raider-style, with plenty of hidden loot.   BUT most of the game was less memory-hunter based, and more generic 3D beat 'em up/ brawler style. Considering the tone of the game, that seemed a little brainless and repetitive; i was surprised actually. There was WAY too much running down corridors, fighting off multiple waves of enemies, and then running down more corridors. In fact that was 80-90% of the game. A little Final Corridor 13-ish.   I'm not a fan of a combo-based fight system either, and this one felt particularly restrictive, with only 2 buttons to use and a specific timing required to land them successfully. The S-pressens with the timer system and the Jammer did a little to alleviate the repetition, but really i think the game would have been much better with more puzzles, more Neo Paris, fewer(/no?) enemies (outside of bosses) and with the S-Pressens as the basic fight system.  That probably would have saved me from a few of the game-breaking bugs that this game still suffers with too, mostly happening when a cinematic doesn't play after a fight, or when you're just casually walking somewhere and randomly die because the game has decided you're out of bounds. God bless the Steam Community for their fixes.  Despite my complaints, it's 100% worth playing if you're looking to play something refreshingly non-FPSy and atmospheric. If you're a sci-fi fan (Blade Runner etc.) you'll probably enjoy it, and definitely if you're a brawler fan.",

The story is good with a bet-you-didnt-see-this-coming-but-really-you-did ending. I like games with a good twist at the end (e.g the Bioshock series) but this was a little bit predictable and you don't really get all the answers that you're looking for.  It feels unpolished and buggy for a 2013 game, the camera does a weird shake thing sometimes when you move the mouse a certain way stuck, enemies get stuck so you have to restart from the last checkpoint, the remix memories get stuck at the end and you can't rewind (occasionally). Oh, and I 'fell' through the ground out of the game level once when searching for a satPatch.  In saying that, the graphics are very good, as is the voice acting and voice mapping. The battles aren't too hard but can get frustrating when you have to keep repeating them because you die or an enemy gets stuck. There is a nice variety of enemies though, but they don't get 'harder' per say, theres just more to take on at once.  I loved the idea of the memory remixes, however there weren't very many of them and they are frustrating as anything at times!    TL,DR; Interesting story, good graphics and sounds etc but game feels unpolsihed and is a bit buggy.

Yes, this game is a bit dated in terms of graphics / effects, but honestly, I rather take a good game that has good art direction over new effects and some thrown-together assets any day.  The only drawback I had when playing, is that I had to play it in compatibility mode to fix the audio and there were some stuttering when loading models (like looking at the floor or transitioning to a new scene). But those are rare.  It's how I think a game should be. Good controls, good art style, interesting story, new game mechanics I haven't yet seen in another game and a well-designed UI. What I like about it especially is that when you're low on health, the screen begins to glitch, which is a simple idea, but fits the theme perfectly.",

Remember Me is a very deep philosophical game, wrapped in basic action game that has a vaguely Ubisoft feel to it, despite being a Capcom game. It works well with an Xbox controller, the graphics and game design are good, and the action sequences are nothing special but customising your own combo strings is an entertaining feature, though it requires DLC to be properly enjoyed which seems a bit rude on Capcom's part.  The real place that Remember Me shines is the story which act as a vehicle for some very clever philosophy. The main concepts Remember Me explore are what makes up a person's identity; how how fallible people's memories are; and how memories, when interpreted differently, can change how a person will act in the future, and hence, can effectively change a person's identity.  The problem I encountered with Remember Me was that it forced me to take a another look at my interpretation of reality. My conscious existence is really only confirmed by my point in time interpretation of the world around me. I am not the years I have lived, nor am I the years I am yet to live, I exist only here and now. I have memories of existing previously, and I have plans of how I plan to continue living into the future, but since both of these things exist only in my mind, and my mind is fallible, what does my existence mean?  If you're looking for an action game, there are plenty of other games you could try, but if you want some philosophy carried along by a serviceable story with your action, Remember Me is a pretty good choice.   7 out of 10, would reminisce again.",

Most of the voice acting was good enough, and I had very few glitches and only one crash I can recall. Why, then, am I not recommending the game? Well, because those are the only good things I can really say about the game from my experience, except perhaps that it was a good idea that did not turn out well.  Is this an awful game? No. However, the game fails almost entirely on its gameplay, explaining the world you're in, and the plotline itself. The gameplay largely consists of much crappier versions of activities other games have already done. Did you think the modern Tomb Raider or Uncharted games did a decent enough job of climbing sections? Well, Remember Me does a far crappier version of these. Perhaps you thought the Batman Arkham games had some enjoyable third person brawling combat? Get ready for a very poor man's version of that system. Not only that, but the game is set in a sci-fi location where memories and tech are everything...in presentation, at least. In actuality, 90% of your controntations in the game are punching and kicking the crap out of stuff.  In regard to the game explaining the world you're in, they just didn't even try to have a coherent set of rules for this future setting. You can alter memories, but it's only important maybe 5 times in the entire game. There are 'execution' moves you can pull off that don't kill enemies but do a blast to their head. The game never tells you exactly what this does. It's implied that it messes with their memories. There is more involving stealing memories as well as having a hologram arm thing that shoots projectile energy...but it doesn't seem to have a port to fire the energy or anything like that. The technology is never explained and feels terribly out of places. It -looks- nice, but this game's only positives tend to be graphical. The plot of the game largely relies on various pieces of technology and things these pieces of technology do, when you're still trying to grasp what this tech does, and there are mutant things you fight which the game does a terrible job of explaining what they are as well. This is one of the most poorly constructed games as far as explaining how stuff works in that universe, that I've ever seen.  Remixing memories is decent enough, but by the last two times I had to do it, I was well past the point where I wanted the game to be over. The game has 8 chapters, the last of which is super short, but by the time I was finishing chapter 5, I was very ready for the game to be over. If not for the game's visual presentation, the fact I paid for it, and that I really like science fiction settings, I do not believe I ever would've mustered the willpower to complete this game. I doubt I will ever play it again, as trying another game or replaying any of dozens of better games was a far better use of my time than this.  Since the visual look of the game is its strongest point, I'd actually recommend that if you want to enjoy this game, that you just watch a few Youtube videos to see the city and everything. It looks great. That's about all there is to really like about the game, though. In a few years when graphics are far better in so many other titles, this game will have nothing it does better than other games, so I cannot recommend it.",

The demo I'd played led me to believe that I'd be spending most of my time going into people's memories and changing them, but across 8 chapters, you only get to do so 4 times. The bulk of the game is spent running around and fighting. While navigating the landscape's numerous ledges, ladders and landings is fun, the game constantly stops you for overly-long combat sequences; in a game where your main character is so mobile, it would have been nice to have the option to avoid some of the combats by taking alternate routes. The combat is theoretically made easier by the inclusion of customizable attack combos, but the timing on them is so fiddly that using any but the simplest one is extremely iffy; often you'll get three hits into a combo before the engine decides that you were trying to perform an entirely different combo and starts you over. There are also special abilities that allow you to deal massive damage, stun enemies, perform instant kills, or turn certain types of enemies against the rest, but using them requires you to perform combos to power up your special meter. This gets more aggravating later on when you encounter enemies that damage you when you attack them; you can instant-kill them with the aforementioned special move, but if you encounter multiples of this enemy, you'll have to take a lot of damage while hitting them to build up your meter and reduce your cooldown timers. Boss fights last an unforgivably long time, requiring you to fight off wave after wave of basic enemies so you can use your special move and actually attack the boss. By the time I'd reached the final boss fight, I'd had enough of the combat and decided to watch the ending on Youtube instead, which I'd recommend over playing the game. I will give Remember Me credit for one thing, though: It's nice to see a game starring a biracial character, though I didn't realize she was one until around 2/3 through the story.",

There is another interesting and original part of the game however, the memory remix. First of all this is clearly a console game, which is very bad ported for PC. The controls feels clumsy, the menus do not support 'normal' mouse-mode, and you are forced to navigate in an annoying console-way. And the memory remix is the most bad ported part in the entire game. To rewind in these parts, you literally have to clear your computer desk, to make space for you to look stupid with your mouse, while you make big counter-clockwise movements with your mouse. Very, very bad control! Another clumsy and glitchy part of the game is the fight parts. And except from that, these are furthermore quite trivial and boring on the long term.

The premise of this game is interesting enough, you have a memory hunter, an 'errorist' of the most extreme sense a political terrorist to take down the big bad corporation. Yadda yadda ya. First big problem: game crashes on Ch 0. Worrisome. Game cache to fix, downloads 1.1gb of missing data.... okay? How on Earth was that not installed?  The story gives an illusion of choice. There were huge forks in the story where a good/bad moral choice system good have been implemented but Capcom decided to go on an rails route- which really makes for a wholey underwhelming story. The character debates through internal dialogue scenes about how her floating head compatriot Edge might be 'good or bad' and he's 'super militant'- that's great- but we literally have no say, and we're shoved around in the story to do his bidding. If we just had our memory wiped (this is no spoiler, you're literally exposed to that in the first second of game play) wouldn't we approach things with a different perspective?  The game mechanisms are boring, the combo system is boring and has no rewards. I just set up the 5 and 6 combo to basically be healing and maximum PMP/recharge gain. Never died unless I wanted to.   Summary of this stupidity:  Gameplay: 4/10- at least you could combo somewhat seamlessly, the finishers had no variability and no bonuses for using them Story: 7/10- interesting premise, horrid execution Optimization: 2/10- when it worked it was incredibly pretty... when the bosses didn't bug out and you were stuck running around in an arena with the bodies of the slain Protagonist: 4/10- Boring and repetitive, could be interchangeable with any of the other 'mainish' cast members, suffers from a marionette storyline and dialogue  Overall character design: 8/10 pretty interesting of like... the 4 people you get to interact with. -2 for stupid enemy design with MMO gradient leveling (i.e. this bug is red instead of blue so is therefore higher level) Overall: 5/10  Would not recommend. Do not waste your money, go play DMC or AC instead- at least you have some open world explorability and replayability.",

Memory remixing: These sequences - in which you have to change somebodys memory of an event - usually allow you to interact with 1 to 5 objects in the memory to change their outcome.

It wasn't worth the time I spent frustratingly playing this game, though. Just watch a Let's Play and support Dontnod by buying your friends copies of Life is Strange. That game is genuinly my 2015 GOTY, and that comes from a Metal Gear Solid fanatic who adored MGSV.  To get into more specifics: the gameplay is really plain/frustrating/stupid/immersion-breaking, only punctuated by its most unique aspect of 'remixing memories' around 3 times total out of my 9 hours of gameplay. The rest is spent holding up and jumping around a lot, along with the most annoying and frustrating combat system and enemy AI routines you can imagine. Its not worth your frustration.  Oh, and the writing is god-awful. The voice acting for the guy who talks to you throughout the game couldn't be flatter if it tried. Its very obvious they went and got a French native to try to act in English.

Unlike some AAA titles (yes, I am looking at you, Witcher!)) - The soundtrack is kinda nice (but the intentional sound glitches in music are annoying)  Cons - glitchy camera (camera shakes or floats around even when standing still, different sensitivity in different areas, glitches if too close to character, resets to centered position after some time - annoying when trying to look around. The camera feels like you are moving it with a controller stick, rather than mouse. I would consider it bad for a PC game.) - fixed camera positions (a lot of times the camera will be fixed to a set position, especially annoying if you are trying to look around for secret areas. This brings us to the next point) - unintuitive controls (when camera is fixed a direction you want to go might not be the button you will press e.g. left can be up for example; other times the game is slow to recognize a button that you have been mashing for a few seconds now) - poorly thought out combat (combos are nice but it's very hard to execute them in required time with many enemies around: you have to keep track of enemies around you, dodging pretty much every second, look at the combo gauge to monitor the combo progress and make sure that your character is actually doing the combo YOU want while also doing the correct combo sequence and still, the combo sequence will reset for no reason sometimes -_- ) - very linear levels (the game offers no freedom at all, you have to go through the specific narrow corridor that the devs set for you; there is little chance to explore, only preset surfaces are climbable and others are not, just 'cause) - aiming is terrible (the game has a ranged weapon. It snaps to targets. You will need to use this weapon against enemies that will be right next to you. There will be more than one enemy next to you. The game will always choose the worst target for you ('thanks autoaim, yes, I wanted to shoot that guy on the other side of the room and not any of the ones currently tearing my face off' - every. single. time. seriously!)) - unskippable cutscenes (might not seem important but this game has a lot and if you are replaying a level, or just reloading a checkpoint - you will have to watch all the cutscenes again - and some of them are over a minute. You can't even alt-tab and do something else because the cutscenes will pause too!) - the QTE-s (they are not hard but having them right at the end of a tough boss battle is highly annoying. I mean I have already fought the boss, I have overcome all his special attacks and waded through crowds of his minions but if you fail one press of a QTE - the game goes 'NOPE!' do some of that ♥♥♥♥ again)  Get this game only if it is on sale and you are really bored. Towards the end I actually used a trainer speed things up, get through the final 2 episodes and just be done with the game. The combat in the latter episodes is plain infuriating as the only thing the game does to make it more difficult is literally swarm you with enemies who just spam you with regular attacks.",

Now to explain my experience: I was initially intrigued by the game's setting and the concept of stealing memories. It's a fresh concept and started off on a good foot. However, as the game went on, the story started to get less and less interesting, filled with a large number of tropes and cliches, and the worst of all, feeling padded with levels that were way longer than they should've been. The game can be summarized as a collection of cutscenes connected together by tonnes of climbing, combat, and stealth sections, which often repeated in every single stage.  I enjoyed the combat. It was fun stringing together combos and making each hit in a combo do something, like heal self or reduce the cooldown on skills. Getting a chance to dodge whenever I want, and we've got a very dynamic combat, enhanced even further by fun S-Pressen skills, which act like special abilities, such as a short fury burst, or slowing the enemy reactions, or even making machines turn on their allies and self-destruct.  The boss fights were either love or hate experience for me. I enjoyed some of them, like the Zorn robots, but the ones against some important characters were irritating, because most times they were completely invulnerable to everything but one skill, and unfortunately the skill you needed to use would go on a long cooldown after you use it. Even with the help of cooldown reducing skills, this still dragged out the boss fights way longer than they should've been. To make boss fights even worse, you had to finish each boss off with a series of QTE button presses. If you make a mistake, the boss heals some health and you have to keep fighting them.  Another common gameplay mechanic is the climbing. It's very similar to Assassin's Creed style of climbing around buildings and rooftops, except it's pretty much 100% linear. There are no big cities to explore. You pretty much make your way from one ledge to the next the entire time. At times you'd be forced to do stealth sections, where you must avoid getting seen by drones. These drones could insta-kill you if you got in their field of view, so making one tiny mistake meant an instant game over, and not being able to save whenever you want, you'd often be taken back to the last checkpoint.  Lastly, the game also had rather cool memory remix sections, where you had to alter someone's memory and make them think that what really happened was different. It's an awesome idea and I thought it was great, but there were only 4 such sections in the entire game. Moreover, despite how cool they were, I don't see them being fun the second time round, when you already know what to do.  Overall I was a bit disappointed. The game had a nice premise, a cool setting, and both the visuals and music were nice too, but its gameplay suffered for the most part and got very repetitive very fast, and the story got less interesting in the second half. Because of this, I can't recommend it to most players, but I think some players will enjoy it very much.",

The gameplay consists of climbing sequences, fist fights, puzzles, and memory remixing. The climbing sequences are all completely linear with an arrow always telling you where to jump next, requiring no thought or skill. The fights required some skill, but were mostly quite repetitive and not particularly interesting - and tend to end with a sequence of quick-time events.   On the other hand, the few puzzles in the game were well done, but there is not much more to say about them.

I try to be as lenient and generous as possible when rating a game, since a lot of people put a lot of effort and time into it. I played the game on normal difficulty because I was more interested in the story than the gameplay but still wanted a bit of a challenge. I also didn't read any reviews before starting the game so that I would be as unbiased as possible.  Plot: 8/10 The plot sounded very unique to me. It lived up to my expectations for the most part. It was short but entertaining. It was also the only thing that kept me from uninstalling the game and burying the game deep into my do-not-replay list. I'm not going to say much more than that because I don't want to spoil anything for people who haven't played it yet.  Gameplay: 3/10 Ok, so here starts the bad part of my review.  Movement in the game was not great. I found it pretty hard to get precise movements because I was always running. Trying to climb a ladder was absolutely horrendous and I often had to walk away from it and come back. There were plenty of times where I would say: 'wtf I can't move' or 'that is definitely not the way I was trying to go' or 'why can I not just walk up to the ladder and climb the damn thing!' or 'that is not the direction I wanted to jump but ♥♥♥♥ it' Camera control was just as bad, if not worse. The camera angles were automatically set by the game before I could control them. During battle the camera would lock onto an enemy when I didn't want it to, and when I did want it to, it wouldn't. This posed a problem with both positioning and fighting, as there were almost always objects in the way and I would have to interrupt my combo just so I could see what I was hitting. There were also times where I wouldn't be able to see an enemy's attack and get hit. Combat was interesting and unique in theory, but in actual practice I would usually miss the timings on the combos or just flat out not attack at all. Yes, there were times where I couldn't attack the enemy directly in front of me and had to back off. I'm not talking about the invisible enemies; it made sense that I couldn't hit them. I'm talking about walking up to an enemy, pressing an attack key, and nothing happening. Dodging was rather frustrating as well because my combo would never continue after landing. I found the S-Presens to be rather useless to me as well and there was no upgrading potential for anything. Also I found enemies either too hard or too easy; it never felt like the difficulty I had selected. There was also hardly any depth to the game at all. I couldn't even talk to NPCs to get the same stale, scripted line over and over again. There were shops and other areas that remained inaccessible to me. I understand the game is pretty much story focused, and the shops wouldn't have proved to be useful at all, since you don't carry items, but it still would've been nice to at least talk to people. Another thing, you play as a fugitive that has her face plastered on every wall and featured on the news, yet I could stand in front of someone for hours. If a memory-stealing fugitive walked up to me, I'd run like a bat out of hell. Memories were few and far between. I think I stole someone's memory about 8 times and remixed memories less than that. That was the whole premise of the game, so I'm pretty upset I couldn't do it more. There was no challenge with stealing the memories either. You didn't have to sift through their mind to find the memory you want, you just press a button and done. Remixing was interesting but overall not challenging at all. There were no puzzles in the game at all, while they aren't necessary, they would've been a nice addition. There was no stealth either and dodging attack drones was easier than taking candy from a baby. Cutscenes. WAY TOO MANY OF THEM. Honestly, it felt like an interactive movie more than a game. Things I should've done as the player were done with a cutscene (crouching under a door for example) however the cutscenes were really well done. I also found myself restarting from checkpoint a few times due to glitched enemies, either they wouldn't die or wouldn't appear, thus preventing me from going forward. Luckily there are a metric ♥♥♥♥ton of checkpoints.  Characters: 4/10 The main character was, obviously, fleshed out and 3 dimensional. And she was the only one. In the beginning you meet some guy who owns a bar that is pretty much the hub for the Errorist revolution and you see him twice for 5 minutes each time. You remix an assassin's memory and get her to become your ally and that's it for her. Edge is the only other person in the game that has almost as much depth as your character, but overall falls flat. There are a few other characters that you interact with in the game but they are just so unimportant you don't feel anything when something happens to them. Honestly, in a story driven game, plot and characters make all the difference.  Graphics I'm not going to rate graphics since pretty much every game has the same graphics these days. Good graphics is and industry standard now so it's no surprise to me that the game looked good. Even on my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ GT 640. However, I don't play many neo-steampunk games and I found the environment very refreshing. But environment doesn't make the game. That's like saying a book has a beautiful cover but nothing on it's pages so no points for that.  Audio Again, no points here either. The soundtrack was very good but good music is also something we've come to expect in our games. Especially from a huge name developer like Capcom.  Price/Performance: 10/10 This is basically my way of saying whether it was worth the money I paid for it. I rate games based on $1/hr. For every dollar I pay, I should expect that many hours of play time. The game didn't disappoint in this area at all.  There wasn't any multiplayer in the game that I could find, but I wasn't really looking either. I just wanted this game off my list.   Overall the game was a 5/10. It had the story to be game of the year for sure but there was no depth or gameplay to follow up. I purchased my copy while it was on sale at  humblebundle.com  and I would suggest getting it if it's less than $4 or $5. If they make a sequel explaining how the revolution started, filled in the plotholes in this game, how the main character became a part of it, and fleshed out the characters and environment, they'd probably get game of the year.",

Many of the smaller plot points are poorly explained or contain not-quite plot holes: they are 'not-quite' holes, because while they don't contradict what you've heard before, they to now allow for you to follow easily with the plot without going 'Well, maybe she did that because....'

Unfortunately, the controls and gameplay are so bad that it truly outweighs the visual beauty and story.   I'll repeat that. A gorgeous setting and decnt story cannot in any way save a game that plain sucks to play. I read a few reviews that mentioned bad controls but I want to make it absolutely clear that the controls make the game almost unplayable. Merely walking forward is a challenge but navigating the poorly done tomb raideresque jumping sequences is an exercise best completed by those that hate fun.   And I haven't even mentioned the combat. After 4 fights, I began dreading the mere existance of other peope in this game lest they be some sort of person with which I might have to engage in combat. Remeber those terrible controls that make walking a chore? Well, some of the combat sequences require precision paths. If your character, which handles like a drunken ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ after an all night gang bang, veers from the specific path...instant death. That's it. No health loss, just death. Then there is the combo mechanic. You can assign some button presses to link moves together and do things like score extra damage or regenerate health. What seems like an interesting idea is made painfully tedious by the nearly 1 second lag between any button press and the cooresponding action. And yes, the combo mechanic is based on timing.   If this was a movie or book, the setting and story would probably do really well. The art direction is amazing. Atmospherically comparable to the Bioshock games if not better. The story seems pretty clever and something I'd like to see. I just owe it to myself and my sanity not to play this as a game.    I would buy the sequal to this in a heartbeat if the art director and storyteller took the gameplay devs out back and did something horrible to them...like force them to play this game.",

            "review_text": "I was very hyped to play Remember Me. I recall back when I saw release trailers of this game, and wanted to buy it since (sadly I had a very old PC and couldn't run it). When I did buy it, it is sad to say that it did not live up to the hype I heard about it. It has been a while since I have played it, but I thought since I completed it I should write a review. I apologize for any spoilers I may reveal.  Pros:  - As far as graphics go, Remember me is a beautiful game through and through. From simple parts of the game such as running through an area, or in one of the interactive Remix cutscenes, this game left a great impression on me.  - The way you traverse the levels by jumping acrossed obstacles or climbing structures was brilliant.  - The combat system was simple, yet not gamebreaking. While you can buy the combo lab DLC (like I did) and easily cheese most enemies in the game, the vanilla game's combat was just relaxing enough to not overly stress me, but just difficult enough that I couldn't just rely on using the same strategy on every enemy.   - The game mixed up enemy behavior and weaknesses just enough that every combat sequence had to actually be thought out, and new enemies would spawn mid sequence that forced you to switch tactics (for example, the enemies that crawled on walls and shot at you forced you to use ranged attacks to defeat them, while melee enemies still attacked you).   - The story was very gripping for the most part, and even with the limited time there is to play the game (more on that later) the main character's story is still gripping enough to want you to know what happens next in the plot (the ending not so much though).  I do not want to take away from the pros of this game. However, there are, in my opinion, major cons that make me lean towards not recommending this game to others.  Cons:  - First and foremost, this game was really short. The plot left a story that had so much more room for exploration, and the Remix sections of the game were unique in a way that I haven't really seen before or since. However, after 10 hours of gameplay, I just couldn't continue to play. I feel like the ending of the game was rushed, and then left on a cliffhanger (as many plot points seemed forgotten and unfinished after the final boss).  - The Remix system was beautiful, but glitched or bugged out constantly. I was repeatedly looking for an item to interact with, just to find that it wouldn't respond to my tampering, regardless of how many times I rewind to the beginning or restarted the game all together. While the first remix was the one that had the most problems, it was also the most frustrating. Constantly freezing in the middle of a cutscene so important to the main story is a real bummer.  - With the 99 cent DLC package ( I bought on a Christmas sale: price is initially $3.99), combat becomes way too broken. The attacks learned take up the same slots (I.E. X or Y) and can be placed almost anywhere in a combo sequence. However, they do a noticeably higher amount of damage at almost the same speed as a regular jab or kick (even the dragon uppercut somehow was on par with speed, even with the theatrics).  - While it could have been a major joke that went over my head, the Spammer lives up to its name a bit too well. You can literally just run around blasting people in the face until they inevitably die. While it is super weak and takes quite a bit to kill many of the stronger enemies, it is the definition of a cheese weapon. Just run or jump around the arena and shoot the enemy, wait for it to recharge (the recharge time was really fast as well) , and repeat. Along with the built in health recovery system this game has already, it makes you pretty much invincible if you don't feel confident in a hand to hand confrontation (or taking on a large group of enemies).  - I followed the whole story, yet the final boss, in my opinion, makes no sense as to why it is even there. The whole time the story is about the family of the main character, and about those that their influence has effected. Instead of confronting some sort of political figure or person of importance from your past, you fight a giant robot in a virtual reality-like simulation. You defeat the giant robot, and then... game over. It really seems random in a game about political and economic power.  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  All in all, I give Remember me a 7/10. I only say 'NO' to a recommendation because there is no 'MAYBE' option. I wouldn't buy this game unless it goes on sale.",

While the artists carried through and created a beautiful and immersive setting, the writers and designers failed to distinguish themselves as anything more than 'meh'.  The combat is boring. Skill really doesn't come into play once you've gotten the hang of the simplistic system. Instead throughout the game you are forced to spam overused combos in fights which are varied in aesthetic only. The 'combo lab' which is supposed to provide an individualized feel to the system, fails to do so through lack of any meaningful choice.  The one redeeming piece of design in this game, are the memory sequences in which you rewrite a person's memory. These are entertaining and add a somewhat puzzlish (ish) aspect to the game, however they lack depth and are few and far between. If the developers had focused more resources on making these sequences long and complex, this game might be something worth remembering.  The game is painfully linear. When I say linear, I don't mean just working your way through a level. I mean there is so little that you can actually do, for most of the game you just do what the game tells you. In the climbing sections the game tells you where to go, which doesn't even matter because unlike a game with a real climbing element, there is only ever one climbing route. Leave your thinking caps at home.  The nail in the coffin is the shameful writing. What could have been the saving grace of the game feels like it was written as a first draft in a highschool creative writing class. The world isn't coherent. The characters lack meaningful motivation. Any backstory is so brief and trivial that a sane person wonders why these characters sound like children who didn't learn to be nice in kindergarten.  The game is beautiful, but thats where it ends. To ask $30 for this game is abhorrent. If you really want it, don't set any expectations, and for the love of steam wait for a significant sale.",

Its 2084 in Neo-Paris and the technological giant Memorize (seemingly) controls all facets of society through its massive influence gained by pioneering memory-related technologies.      Creative design choices in art and stylistic direction.  Since this is the future everything is holograms, and since everyone has a chip in their mind then gameplay prompts and messages can be incorporated into the game through holograms in an unobtrusive manner that makes sense. It's really unique and keeps the UI as minimalistic as possible There's also a ton of graffiti in the city that looks cool.     Original game mechanics in the mind sequences whereby you alter past memories by changing things in the environment to lead to a different conclusion.  You'll see a cutscene play out, then prompted with a task which is carried out by rewinding and fast forwarding the scene and changing various little things in it that lead to a different conclusion. So you might close a cup holder or move a table slightly; these small changes lead to a logical change in outcome that is always interesting to see. Sadly, there's only 4 of these sequences, but what's there is still good.  The Bad     Interesting scenario that is barely touched. Just as with Mirror's Edge, the game has this interesting scenario that feels as if it hasn't been fully taken advantage of.  You have a future world where memories have been digitized and there is apparently vast disparity between rich and poor, but the game is about you helping a resistance movement wreak havoc on the city. It's difficult to really understand what exactly has led to societal disparity to such extremes since it's never fully delved intoAll we know is that these rich people have it well off and this other area looks like ♥♥♥♥. The megacorporation Memorize, which has pioneered digitized memories, is a multinational monolith that is propped up as evil, but what exactly is so evil about societal progress isn't explained. It's as if the idea of the overworld exists, but why it exists as it does and the problems underlying it are never delved into. You're just supposed to look at the sh*t areas and think, ''wow, Memorize sucks, it's somehow their fault cause rich people amirite feel the bern''. Even one of the civilians during the chaos asks why you did this to them from their windows, and....nothing comes of it. I'm standing there thinking, ''yeah, why are you doing this again?''. Sh*t even the protagonists asks herself this but doesn't persue the train of thought. Ultimately its a personal story about the protagonist recovering her memories, and it seems like the idea behind the rebellion is just a plot device rather than having any significance.     Linearity without challenge.  There's nothing wrong with a linear game, but there IS an issue if the linearity makes the game too easy. My problem with this game isn't that you're essentially going down a winding corridor, it's that there's no challenge while you're doing so. Since you just have to press A to do all actions, and since you're following a small prompt that tells you what ledges to get on and off of (and since they're the ONLY ledges you can get on anyway), all you're doing for the majority of the game is pressing A in the right direction. Sure, it looks nice as the scenery unfolds and the camera changes angles, but halfway towards the game that was no longer enough to keep me entertained. You can have linear platforming (Megaman, Sonic) without being overwhelmingly easy. The game might as well play itself.    And now for the in-between:  The Fight system. It's pretty much the Arkham battle system: you press a button (X or Y) to keep a combo going and have to dodge enemy attacks in the middle of combos. Where it sets itself apart is in three ways:  -There are four pre-set combos. XXY, XYYXYY, YXYXY, and one other that I never used. -Customization comes in using keys (unlocked by gaining experience) to unlock one of 4 types of nodes. There's power nodes (increased damage), chain nodes (increases damage of all previous nodes), health nodes (health restored), and time nodes (lowers cooldowns of special moves). In order to use a combo, it has to have a node in it. So you can't just press XXY, X needs to be a node, as does the other X and Y. So combos can have different effects depending on the nodes used. -There are 5 special moves unlocked as the game progresses that have cooldowns once used. Some are instrumental to fighting particular types of enemies.  It's pretty interesting, but the lack of complexity shows itself midway through the game as you'll most likely settle on one combo for pure damage, one for health restoration, and one to decrease cooldowns. There's variety in enemies that keeps the fights somewhat interesting and requires slight alterations in fights, but it's nothing that can hide the simplicity in the mechanics themselves. In the end, you'll be pressing the same combo in fights and switching to health restoration when necessary.  Overall I'd say the game is....alright. The scenario could've had something grander in it, but it settles on being a personal message about the protagonist's own life that I didn't care for. It's difficult for me to fully appreciate a twist when the other character involved in the twist was just introduced and only talked about 5 minutes prior. Shrug.  This isn't a downvote cause the game is bad; it isn't. It's just overall underwhelming and really nothing special. Its mind sequences are pretty interesting but there are only 4 of them, and the platforming is following a prompt telling you what ledge to jump on and pressing A with a few fights in-between. It's not bad, it's just not worth it and slightly disappointing. Was fun halfway through, until I stopped caring as much and just wanted to get to the end.  ",

The player has 0 autonomy: you do what the scenario planned for you... or there is no way to progress. On the technical side, this game is buggy as hell (hello camera collisions that prevent you from seeing anything of the fight you are currently in), has extremely ungainly control scheme on PC (it's obviously made to play with a controler... except I bough a PC VERSION, not a console version, so make it playable on a keyboard, for ♥♥♥♥'s sake), and is of extremely unequal difficulty. Most fights are ridiculously easy... except the boss fight, which are invulnerable to everything except a combo you are very unlikely to find by yoursel. If I have to trawl cheat forums to progress in the game... guess what: you suck.",

            "review_text": "As obvious a statement as it is, the easiest way to describe 'Remember Me' is that it is forgetable. It's a game that tries to be a lot of things at once: a platformer, a puzzler, a fighting game, a 3rd person shooter, a stealth game... and it does succeed... passably. It's not a game that will challenge you to think or play differently.   The story is full of cliches, weird lines and forgetabble characters. It mentions, in passing, the possible repercussions of a society where memory manipulation would be possible. But ironically it has the main character non-chalantly exploit these techniques, with not much justification. Instead of thinking about these problems, the game instead decides to turn them into physical enemies you can defeat by repeatedly mashing on the kick/punch buttons. You'll be doing the same 2-3 combos for the rest of the game, along with the few special power up techniques you automaticall acquire as you progress.  The game shines when you play the memory manipulation minigame, where you have to change key aspects of a memory to get different effects. And what is so refreshing about them is that, in contrast to the rest of the game, these segments actually give you choices. All other gameplay portions just offer linear paths, except for the one of two optional paths that lead to collectibles or power ups. Otherwise, you just keep following the tracks till you get to the ending. I wish the game contained more of these kinds of puzzles.  Now that I write this, maybe the best way to describe 'Remember Me' is as a hypothetical remake of one of those old school street brawler games (e.g. Double Dragon, Ninja Gaiden). All you do is go in one direction, jump around, press buttons and fight the same kind of enemies using the same combinations. Maybe it would have worked better that way.  If you can get this game for cheap (e.g. I got my copy from a bundle), give it a shot. It's like junk food, you won't get challenged, you won't learn anything new, but it will keep your attention enough for you to finish it.",

            "review_text": "The game is OK overall. It has some very strong elements like the incredible art style and voice acting, but overall impression is ruined by boring and repetitive gameplay.  The Good: - Art style and environments look absolutely gorgeous. - Quality voice acting. - The memory mini-game is actually quite fun, but you only get to do that on a few select occasions.  The Bad: - There is only one path with no room to explore. There's a lot of parkouring elements, but you just follow the arrows to where you have to jump. - The game repeatedly takes the control away from you to pan the camera over a scenic view or slows you down to crawling pace to have a radio conversation. - The combat is incredibly boring and repetitive. The game would've been improved tremendously with all the combat taken out of it.  The Meh: - Music. Take it or leave it. - Story. Big potential, but average execution. Many things just don't really work or aren't explained. - The characters. People in the game feel like cardboard caricatures.  Overall, the story would've worked very well as a movie or a mini-series. Or even as a different genre. Imagine Life is Strange exactly like it is, but with 5 hours of mediocre filler combat between scenes. If you want to maximise the quality of your experience, start off on the lowest difficulty right away.",

            "review_text": "The gameplay really brings this game to a grinding halt. It also helped me fester on the massive number of invisible walls, the platforming/climbing that revolves around following yellow arrows on where to go next (because they made only very specific paths climbable with no choice really). The story was relatively engaging for an action game, but the combat was terrible, and the world felt stale (inv. walls and terrible exploration climbing). Especially just coming from an Arkham game and DMC combat, this combat is just terrible comparatively. The field of view is so small, that the enemies that climb up on walls and pounce on your don't feel like a challenge, they're just annoying (whereas in many other games, the camera zooms out so you can use your wits to plan). The combos are customizable, but not the way you execute them, just what happens after you do them. For instance, one combo is always X,X,X but you can choose to make some X's heal or some X's damage, which was kinda cool. The combos often break after you dodge enemies (which is very often, there is no 'counter' button, you must just dodge), so it only feels like luck whenever you get a long combo off.  I've played so many games that do all these things better, that it wasn't even close to worth seeing a 'sorta kinda cool' story (it's not really). It's just a philosophical question of what memories really mean and if they define use ... etc etc. I had much more fun playing many other fighting/brawler/combo/hack n slash games recently, Arkham games, DMC, Darksiders, Marlow Briggs, and I'm sure I'm leaving off some other ones.",

You need to rotate your mouse in cirlces like someone struck with a bout of epilepsy because they decided that idiotically spinning mice is the equivalent of moving a control in a circle on a console controller. The menus all anticipate keyboard/console input. It's just one large horrible mess. If you like encouraging gaming companies to make ♥♥♥♥ ports of console games for PCs, go ahead and get this game. Otherwise, save yourself hours of annoyance and skip this for better produced games - even games by the same studio such as Life Is Strange which was enjoyable to play on the PC.",

            "review_text": "As one of the first game of Dontnod Entertainment, I could say they did a great job. They really improved on their second game - Life is Strange. And honestly, I just bought this game since it have the same developer as Life is Strange   and waited for it to be put on sale (still waiting for the DLC to be on sale once again)    Pros: [1] The   graphics   of this game is really, really good. (I even saved a lot of screenshots of this game). [2] The game is perfect for dystopian or cyberpunk fans. The   setting   of this game is great, the Neo-Paris. [3] The pressens and S-pressens are awesome. OVERLOAD!!!!  Cons: [1] Not all items are interactive. You could only climb or jump at a specific place. Sometimes the distance doesn't matter when taking a jump. [2] The   camera   is annoying. Especially, when you are fighting enemies the camera will change angle, and instead of dodging the other way, your view was either blocked by the enemy or you are dodging the other way, worst you 'dodge' towards your enemy, receiving their attacks.  *You can even see the other reviews pointing this one out. But no patch updates, but they keep making other games (Vampyr out in 2017) and they still won't even patch it up!  [3] The plot is messy. This is divided into parts, with monologues in between. So somehow there are gaps in the story. There are no background information on almost every character. (Since you have an amnesia). Sometimes when you met a character, and you won't meet them again. It seems that the developers wants to bring a twist by    connecting almost every character to Nilin.    And that plot twist is meh. [4] Remember Me, though there are only four remixes throughout the game. It is more of a parkour (though this one   could   be put on the pros, the parkour part). [5] The final battle *dun dun dun dun* *heartbeat bg* is lame. It is the easiest battle, the easiest 'boss' to beat, in the whole entire game (maybe even in all the games in the world). It is not that necessary, I hope that they did that differently, not using your pressens, maybe your remixer. [6] The combos could only be unlocked by the DLC. And somtimes it is hard to have a combo since it is often broken when you hit another enemy, and the attack (on the combo meter) is really slow that you don't know if it landed on the enemy or not. [7] The game is too price-y. [8] DLC is needed in order for you to 'COMPLETE' (100%) the game.  Judgement: This is not supposed to be REMEMBER ME, which is introduces to remixing others because it is rarely used in the game. AMNESIA, nah that game is already phenomenal. Maybe, MEM0R1ZE (or just MEMORIZE) since the plot revolves around it.",
