            "review_text": "Wholeheartedly recommend this if you like 'blobber style' dungeon crawlers. If you liked Might and Magic X, (perhaps I was the only one!), Etrian Odyssey on the DS or Class of Heroes on the PSP, then get this one.  PROS  +Great character design and development +Reasonably challenging turn based combat, especially at first +Decent story +Ambush points make hunting for gear quicker than just random grinding +Autotravel and fast combat cut down on the busywork  CONS -Dungeon design is a bit uninspired. Nothing like Elminage Gothic Royal Tomb to look forward to here. (This might also be a PRO if you don't like being challenged by the environment.  There's really not too many of these being released, especially with these production values. If you like blobbers, get it and put 50 hours or more into it! Also look into Swords and Sorcery: Underworld and, if you find this game too easy, get Elminage Gothic. Now that's a real tough blobber, old school style.",

            "review_text": "Cons: -expensive for a dungeon crawler as JAnime games tend to be priced in the $30 range  -not exactly cutting edge graphics and battle effects, textures look like crap -music is ok but get repetitive  Pros: -low hardware requirements, your potato pc can run this fine -the art is amazing and you can choose between the original one and a more animemified or kawaii version -deep character customization thanks to ability to reclass  -some documentation already existing on how to play this game properly -good challenge, I died in the tutorial battle -STORY, mutiple endings and new game+ according to the wiki! Yes you can actually have a story in a dungeon crawler and the different endings and new game+ give you motivation to play more    Apparently I already have 10 hours played but I haven't completed my party yet I'm just rerolling my bonus pts all this time. 10/10 would press the reroll button again.

            "review_text": "Stranger of Sword City is one of those old-school Dungeon Crawler games inspired by Wizardy and the old Might &amp; Magic games - but it's polished and innovated on the old formula a fair bit.  It trades some of the typical 'grindiness' inherent in the genre with fast paced (though still turn-based) combat and an addictive class-building system where you get to multiclass and transfer select abilities from one class to the other.  This leads to pretty amazing combinations. Picture the Samurai's ability to keep attacking until he gets hit by a counter-attack combined with a ninja's evasion - or a ranger's infinite concentration length with a warrior's 7-hits while in concentration genocide.  SoSC also isn't afraid to give you a decent bit of counters against the RNG that is king in so many dungeon crawler games. Many games in this genre rely on enemies abilities to debilitate or even insta-kill your characters... these are all present in SoSC, but there's counters available if you've played and built your characters cleverly against every single one of these - and while there's stilla decent amuont of grindy 'trash' encounters, most combats actually require a decent bit of thinking before you press the 'commit turn' button.  Your main way to improve your characters, asides from leveling up, is of course gear progression - and here also, SoSC innovates with the 'ambush' system, where - provided you can find the ambush spots in dungeons, you get to pick a fight seeing the reward type and the enemy you'd have to fight for it.  'Hrm, lvl 20 demon for a rare katana, or a lvl 5 bunny for a few common helmets?' type of deal.  Oh, and fairly rare in this type of game, there's 3 seperate ending paths that diverge quite a bit in your final resolution.  That said, SoSC still relies quite heavily on grinding it's content to keep your characters of a sufficient level, which I had little patience for (and thus evaded by checking 'recomended levels' on the wiki, and cheating my characters up a level or two per dungeon, rather than grind through the trash for extra hours for the same effect). That didn't stop this brutal game from murdering me a whole bunch of times, but I still greatly enjoyed the journey.  If you like old school dungeon crawler type gameplay, I'd say Stranger of Sword City feels instantly familiar, while still being innovative and very much 'it's own game'. Highly recommended.  If you *don't* care much for dungeon crawler style games though - give it a miss. Nothing here takes it far enough outside of the scope of it's genre to appeal.",

            "review_text": "An extremely fine DRPG. The original art for the game has a unique style and is a joy to look at. The characters are likeable and the world is intriguing. But again, this is a DRPG and that is what you are going to spend the majority of your time doing: dungeon crawling. For some this makes for some great fun, but others might be turned off by this type of gameplay.   While I am no where near finishing this game, I wanted to give it my recommendation now because I know I'll be playing it for hours to come. If you start it and things seem a little overly simplified to you, wait until you finish everything you have to do in the Mausoleum of Metal. The game opens up in locations you can visit and overall complexity after this.  Here's hoping Experience and NIS decide to bring more of these games onto the PC.",

Yes, it is obscure in its mechanics and lore.  But it is good.  While this type of game is generally not well received in the west because of the aformentioned elements, it is both enjoyable and replayable.  The art style is great, as the music, and the gameply flows naturally once you get the hang of it. But it is truly a japanese dungeon-crawler, with lots and lots of farming, so if this part of the game is a problem to you, you might not want to buy.",

You'll be spending 99% of the time spamming the fast auto battle command only to suddenly notice that your party got wiped because there was a suddenly 10 level higher monsters in the back row and their one AOE attack wiped your entire party. You just lost all progression and it's literally game over so time to load.  The game mechanics, skills, items and leveling system are all extremely shallow and lack choice. There are hundreds of better games to grind in on Steam, pick any one of them instead. They are a lot cheaper as well.  Try Faster Than Light, Invisible Inc. or even King's Bounty: Armored Princess and crossroads to satisfy your grinding needs.",

Gameplay is classic for a dungeon crawler and get the job done. This game allowed me the relive the sweet nostalgia of when I used to play Land of Lore on my old PC - DX33 and just for that it was well worth playing it. I'm sure I still have a lots of thing to discover as I start the 'new game plus' part of the game but the game already has delivered what I paid for before I had even finished my first playthrough and makes it a dungeon crawler that I highly recommend to those who love the genre but I should warn people new to this genre that this is not the easier game to start with as it's difficulty is indeed rather high.",
