            "review_text": "3.5/10 Blaze Epic just can’t learn from his mistakes. This is an action adventure game. Once again, it nails the look and music of retro games. Where it falls apart, just like ninjahtic games, is gameplay. It repeats same mistakes. You mash attack at guys and 1 hit them, but like those games you die in 1 hit. So if you clear a room and last guy kills you have fun restarting it all. Also like ninjahtic mind tricks, every time you re-enter a room all guys respawn. Why does he think that’s a good idea? Having you move in 3d plane but having 2d looking levels are confusing. Guys can attack you at weird angles and you have a huge hitbox. In opposite you can only attack if standing directly in front of them and cant attack in directions, and they have tiny hitboxes to attack. You die all the time. Enemy placement is terrible. 1 room you start in you’re surrounded by 3 guys that just instant kill you. Computer blocks 2/3 attacks but game doesn’t explain how you block and never seems to work. Can’t jump. Lots of backtracking. Controller doesn't work in menus and there is no mouse cursor available. No real story. Just, no.",

            "review_text": "Samurai_Jazz is an action/adventure beat 'em up heavily inspired by NES games. Way more so than most retro games, in fact, down to the obtuse game design. The game pegs itself as a hack 'n slash noir, and I do love the idea of a noir samurai, but the story is entirely incomprehensible. I'm not meaning to say that it's convoluted, just that it's impossible to actually see. Your character makes vague references on occasion, and at the end of the game you fight an evil version of yourself. There's no direct statement as to what's going on or what you're doing, and it feels like a game poorly translated from another language. I supposed that adds to the retro, though.  The game design fairs a lot better than the narrative, setting up each room of enemies as a puzzle. Which enemy needs taken out first, what's the most efficient way to kill them all without getting cut down yourself? The game forces you to ask these questions the more you get into the game. This is only aided with the game's block mechanic, which allows you to strafe and parry at the cost of your movement speed. Combat requires immensely fast reflexes and an analytical mind. You will die, a lot.  The design also suffers from some noticeable setbacks, however, such as an inconsitent design for the most basic enemy: the samurai. They sometimes block your attacks, and sometimes don't. There's no rhyme or reason as to when they do block, and I've tried relentlessly to find an exploit. The only safe means to attack them appears to be parrying back and forth until they give in, but this isn't ideal when many of the rooms require you to destroy samurai quickly, lest you be destroyed by other enemies. It's also very easy to exploit the AI's field of vision, allowing you to lure out enemies one at a time, when they're meant to be faced as a group.  Even considering all of that, I think Samurai_Jazz is worth a look, especially considering its price. It nails the retro game feel far better than plenty of other games I've played. I definitely felt like I was sitting down and pouring my afternoon into an old, obtuse NES game, for better or worse.",
