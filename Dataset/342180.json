Edit: Just finished my first complete playthrough, wow. This is definitely the best game I have played this year, hands down.. (pun not intended). 10/10 would recommend and hope Vertigo/Jaywalkers puts out some DLC's soon!   Pros: - That last scene, wow.  - Mix of feeling like a total bad ♥♥♥ and also like you're drowning from moment to moment, this game has excellent pacing and beats.  - Good mix of weaponry and in normal mode, good amount of ammo. You can 'go Rambo' in some sections and not run out of bullets all the time.  - The music is a great guide, really sets the stage and when necessary makes you go 'oh, sh!t is about to go down..'   Cons: - You feel so bad when you reach certain parts of the game for the main character.. you'll know what I mean when you get there. (This might be a pro?) - Locomotion needs a bit of work, the click to move is somewhat startling at times, however, other than that.. literally zero complaints.    Want more of: - Zombie types - Missions, continued story line  Will update again after I play some apocalyptic and horde modes.",

Reloads are arcady which isn't my taste but acceptable. And of course the biggest elephant in the room with this game is the lack of locomotion. The teleporting is noticably worse than other games but acceptable. There are a few ways they try to limit your teleporting which become annoying rather quickly.   Feels like a good start but I'm left desiring more substance. There's nothing here that is really intriguing except the characters narration.

It's the first VR game I have played that actually feels full and finished.  I have an I5 6600k, granted I overclocked it to perform significantly faster than a non overclocked 6700k I7 and it automatically detected and unlocked the extra physics. Which are the best physics I've seen in VR.  VR is a tough field to develop games for financially. I think the developers did well in taking risks, listening to the community, and make the proper changes.",

            "review_text": "+ Proper gunplay and a good variety of guns, except the shotgun... + Decent graphics and performance + Fun little storyline with some tense dark levels + Horde mode for some replayability + Coop  - Annoying reload mechanic that seems to fail on the most critical moments - Jittery animation transitions which makes point blank defensive shots very difficult ; zombie parts like legs and heads sometimes shift way too erratically when translating in world space.  - SO MUCH MELEE weapons around and you can't use them, súch a missed opportunity. - Most ironsights seem to be vertically offcentre.  - Some scripted sequences suddenly close of nearby area's which were accesible before (and often offer the most cover). This is counter intuïtive and punishes the player for being resourceful. - Teleport mechanic could be a bit more forgiving when surrounded by zombies.  - Flickering directional shadows in some parts of the levels.   Conclusion : A decent story driven zombie shooter which could sell for a little cheaper. The campaign has a maximum of 5 hours of gameplay, lacks depth and feels a bit rushed ; There is a functional compass and lighter which suggests there were plans for some freeroam aspects and a more sophisticated inventory system. There are plentyful melee weapons around which you can pick up, have sharper textures than the other objects and anchor to the controller in a way you'd figure it's usable as a weapon. There are also quite a lot of consumable items such as water, medkits and soda cans around, which also seemed to have served a purpose (in the way they are distributed over the levels). This -really- feels like the developer should've taken/given a bit more time.  And the protagonist could be a little less alchoholic las vegas gambling addict, and a bit more charismatic? I dunno.

I havent yet played this game on a harder difficulty but I'm guessing that the scavenging component goes on to include getting food to heal you, where as in the normal mode you recover within a short time.  I loved the chapter in the mine as it scared the crap out of me :-)  If you like brook haven experiment then this game is a million times better.  The only downside (could be my eyes sight) but i find it difficult to aim using the line of site on the guns and miss quite frequent when I'm not even in a rush to shoot. You could put this down to the recoil but sometimes I even miss when they are right in front of me and the wife played it and agreed (and we never agree on anything :-) ).  Well done developers!",

I bought the vive pretty much just for this game and I am not disappointed.    I will say this, however, you never know how many bullets there are left in the magazine before you need to reload... That being said, it would be so much better if you could see that in a similar manor as you can for the health bar. Because if you reload prematurely you're just wasting ammo by dropping it on the ground and if you don't reload in time you'll lose health.   Looking forward to a sequel!",

There seems to be a lot of negativity towards the game and some of the points are valid, however it gets a big thumbs up from me.   PROS: -Runs smooth on my AMD FX 8350 and Nvidia GTX 1080, with everything set to max. -Looks good, for a VR game. -I like the voice acting and the comments from the main character. -On 'Normal'setting I completed the solo campaign in about 5 hours, and this was well thought out if not a little simple in design (get this lever, go here, open the gate, turn the power on, open another gate etc). -Good gunplay! People keep comparing it to H3VR and Onward, its a totally different game! Its a fun arcade shooter for VR! -Now the Horde single player has been unlocked (I agree this should of always been the case!) it adds a lot more gameplay. -I feel it is very immersive especially in the dark levels with the torch....and I was as relieved as the main character to get back into daylight!!   CONS: -The price! I think for the length of the single player campaign, its expensive for a VR game.....but then its a Niche market and therefore the development costs for VR games is higher!  -Short length of campaign....I hope there will be some DLC to continue the campaign further (Free hopefully!) -The initial locked modes......however I feel it was very professional of the developer to listen to the gaming community and make the relevant changes. -Teleportation...it works, but it does break the immersion.  -Reload....a manual reload would add tension (H3VR has spoilt us) -No Melee.....I think less ammo and the addition of melee weapons would add tension, even a melee only option would be good.  I would have to say, buy this game, play it, remember Steam offers a refund service....use it if its not for you! I have no regrets buying this game, I think its everything a VR action shooter should be, and hope to play more from the same developer. Remember, the only goot Fred is a dead Fred!

            "review_text": "Score 9/10  Should you buy? Yes.   Overview: I loved my playthrough of this game, and will likely play it again on harder difficulty. The point of VR is to be immersed, and I found that for long periods of time I forgot what the real world was. Took me around 6-7 hours to beat the game start to finish. The game has real grit to it, enough to make you feel for the cast in 'The Walking Dead' since you end up in similar situations and need to escape/fight off the walkers. As far as VR Games go, Arizona Sunshine is very satisfying. For 33$ (on sale), this was a great purchase, and the pace is excellent, as far as VR goes. Will it get you those 20 hours plus campaign that AAA titles often bring? No, but odds are that if you have already spent 600+ on a VR Headset you are willing to put a few more away to use it well. If the goal of your purchase is immersion and fun, you are going to get it.    Happy: +Shooting -The overall shooting mechanics are a bit sketch at first, but once you get used to them the rest of the game it's very satisfying blasting away at zombies.  +Level layout -The game itself is well placed out, and takes you through a decent amount of environments. It is easy to tell it wasn't a copy and paste kind of game.  +Zombies -The zombies are stupid (thank goodness), and there is appropriate variation and types that you really don't feel like you see the same 'Fred' everytime.  +Voice Acting -The voice acting is superb and gives humor to a quite dark situation. I loved it.  +User Choice -While the overall game is like that of an arcade shooter, there are a lot of small decisions you learn to make as the game progresses, like planning for an imminent assault and assigning your resources responsibly.  +Game Aesthetics -They did a wonderful job with the looks of the game, including weapons, lighting and general grime. As far as VR goes, this really helps add to the realism.   Crappy: -Ammo -Ammunition is almost always found in containers. Not quite realistic, and I would have preffered that the placements of ammunition make sense in certain places.  -Weapon Variety -Basically all guns can be summed to 4 types. Weapon design is cool, but I wish there were more modified weapons, and maybe even a two handed assault rifle.  -Survival -As a shooter this is very satisfying, but survival almost seems a given. Adding mechanics for finding water or food would be great, even if it's just having a drink and another line of dialogue.  -Storage -You store things on your body, and I really wish I could put to use many things I would find like water.  -Stealth -There is a lack of stealth. Melee weapons could fix this.  -Scavenging -I wish there was a reward for scavenging about, like random chances to find a mod for a gun, extra ammo, a Fred in some rediculous outfit or some extra dialogue. As is, you just follow the set story line and pick up whatever you find.   -Environment -I really wish I could use surrounding elements to my advantage. Perhaps blow something up holding a car back, and have it roll down and run over some Freds? Maybe pick up items and throw them to distract Freds while I sneak away? Craft rudimentary items with the stuff I found?    ",

            "review_text": "They responded to us, likely because of the overwhelming crash of people who didn't even play the game before obliterating it. But, they enabled the mode and I gotta say it's pretty damn fun. Ideally they will tighten up the campaign and MP netcode, but it's gotta be a pain in the ♥♥♥ in VR. At any rate, I'm leaving my previous review that had a thumbs down, but I'm changing it since I've seen studios take much longer than 24 hours to even respond, much less give in to a torrent of angry customers.   Let's see if we forced them to make the wrong decision. 10/10 would participate again. Til then it's horde mode.   -----------------------------  The game at it's core is fine, but they have walled off everyone without an i7 until March of next year.   Aside from being mind-bottlingly stupid, it was presumptuous to say the least to think a game as shallow as this one would be popular enough in 6 months for anyone to care about the additions.   VR gamers are a small group, and this ham-fisted attempt to make money at the cost of fracturing a budding market really shouldn't go unchecked.  --------------------",

I planned on it beating my PC up. i'm running an OC'd version of a GTX 970, and an Intel i5 4690K at stock speed. It defaulted to high settings and I never had any hiccups related to low FPS or anything. --Gun-play is merciless. I've had to learn to always aim carefully, and I've taken to putting my right wrist on top of my left to steady my aim, just like when I'm at the range. When I do, I'm not let down. --Scavenging is necessary. Thanks to Job Simulator, I quickly tried to eat a hamburger patty, which restored some health. Kudos on that clever little addition. Also nice to be forced to break a glass display sufficiently enough to be able to reach through to grab the contents.  Cons: --Teleport mechanic is adequate, but not as good as Call of the Starseed. Theirs lets you rotate the direction you face, which really helps to orient yourself to line up your available Chaperone space with the virtual environment. I constantly was facing a right-in-front-of-me-wall, when i'd rather rotate to physically face another direction so I'd have more freedom to move. --Co-Op -- really a 2-edged sword.  ---I love that it's there and I had a great 2-3 hours trying it out. They do a good job of not letting you get separated, but I would love to be able to share ammunition one magazine at a time. If it's available, I didn't know how to do it. Otherwise, I'd have to play charades with someone who wasn't using a Microphone to go ' hey, you look over here!! (points wildly).' ---The matchmaking is still young for this game, so I'll give it a pass on the rating side, but it's worth pointing out that half of the times I tried to connect, the app would either freeze, with no indication that the map had stopped loading, or it would immediately crash. ---The avatars for other players are just ridiculous, to the point of hilarity. At first I couldn't stop laughing at my buddy, only to realize it wasn't just him. They are very poorly animated, but I understand the limitations as to the 'why.' All the game has to determine player orientation is the presence of the HMD and wands, so hands and head. The game also assumes that the avatar feet should always be on the ground -- a good assumption. So in theory, it seems like a good idea, but in practice, they end up looking like marionettes with feet magnetized to the ground, and the buttocks all up in the air like on the receiving end of a proctologist with a prosthetic telephone pole.  All in all, great game!  I know the matchmaking will improve-- it's an issue many games experience right after release, and it's a shame that it happens, but it's just the way it works.  Last, to the developers -- PLEASE OH PLEASE FIX THE AVATARS. I don't mind if they look more 'Mannequin-ey' if it has to be that way, but the marionnette thing is definitely something that takes away from the immersion.  --Cheese",

This is exactly what I was looking for when I bought thge Vive: an accurate shooter that makes me feel part of the world I'm playing in.  How real does it feel? It actually introduces a sense of panic in me when I start getting overwhelmed by hoards of zombies. I have caught myself on multiple occasions screaming at the zombies and starting to shoot wildly just to survive. I even started kneeling down while shooting on occasion to steady my hand (and it works exactly how it does with real handguns).

Do co op campaign with a good friend and you will be in tears from laughing, and in tears from being scared at times. It's not overwhelmingly scary, just the right amount of spooks for me. It's a mix of survival and exploration. The world is beautiful and the graphics are some of the best I've seen on the vive for a game of this size. Survival, guns, simple problem solving, and oh yeah, zombies. This game is great. The animations for the zombies actually look very realistic, even when you shoot them it looks very convincing. Several times when I was playing I was convinced there were actual people coming towards me. Despite what the dev has chosen to do, don't overlook this game. It is great. And the only thing you would be missing without an i7 is the single player hoard. Not a huge loss in my opinion. The game is well worth the money, and IMO a must have for any Vive owner.",

The frantic reloading that ensues while I'm trying to grab at a different gun on my belt is quite an adrenaline rush.  Story so far seems fairly basic and the main character does get a bit grating at times in my own opinion with his almost constant 'humourous remarks'. But I can set that aside for the fun gunplay and the panic induced reloads when put in a tight spot. I haven't played this in multiplayer or in the horde mode versions yet, but that's going to be coming up soon once I've played through the main story.  This is what VR gaming needed though, an honest to god full game.",

I did not finish it, but some basic thingsI would expect from a title of this price just weren't there. There were also weird quirks that weren't well explained.   1) Things as basic as glass breaking when shot are behind an advanced settings checkbox that supposedly should only be run on i7 CPUs. I wound up turning it on to try and it worked fine on my i5-6600.  2) Touching things with your hands did nothing unless you used the grip buttons. There is no collision between your hands and objects unless you are using the grip button. (Admittedly did not try this after ticking the aforementioned checkbox).  3) Zombies did not react to grippable objects when thrown near them.  4) There were a lot of grippable objects that seemed like something you would use in a Zombie scenario, but actually did nothing (Medpacks, compass, lanterns, etc.)  5) Eating food restores your health but a medpack doesn't?  6) Aiming in this game just felt... off compared to other games I've played. The sights were also often hard to see. White, neon, or glowing dots on the sights would help a lot.  7) Several nooks and crannies that seemed like somewhere you would find supplies, an easter egg, or SOMETHING and they were just dead ends.  8) more locomotion options would be good. From what I could see there was no way to rotate your play area when teleporting like in The Gallery.  9) Filing cabinet bottom drawers not accessible at all, probably so Oculus users wouldn't lose tracking close to the ground.  All this being said, it may be the longest VR game available from what I've seen and read. The voiceover character was pretty good. The environments were good, but not amazing. I enjoyed scavenging for supplies in cars and other areas, but this could be deeper as I mentioned above. A lot of items are there just for you to pickup and then put down again.",

Yes, but that is not a deal breaker for me. The teleportation using the familiar parabolic arc that the lab and others have is fine and I quickly forgot where I was in my room and indeed just sort of teleported around, shoot everything, teleport some more.  The gun sounds are the one area that doesn't feel quite right. I may be biased from playing so much hotdogs, horseshoes, and hand grenades, but the shots sound weak and lack the punch I am looking for.  I recommend you get this game if you like shooting zombies in a well built environment. I have yet to try multiplayer or the horde mode yet so I cannot comment on them.

I have found that the aiming at ranged target with pistols is quite difficult and I hope that the developers will tweak that to allow those of us who are not marksmen to be able to hit the target at range a little easier.

Although the overall game is linear, there are times where you need to explore various locations to locate important items to continue the story. My favorite bit is how at times you get swarmed and are expected to 'move' to a key location while fighting off the zombies to continue. If you sit there gunning down the zombies you'll eventually run out of ammo and die. This is one of the first VR titles i feel really got gameplay down right.  I am running an i5 processor with a GTX980. I set the settings to MAX, and get all the gore and extra zombies. I saw minimal dropped framerates. With i7, as recommended, i suspect it would be butter. I am one of the rare few who are NOT affected by laggy motion and dropped frames. I'd rather get the full experience and have some VR lag, than miss out because of my rig. I do not suggest this for most as this may affect your experience negatively.  There are opportunities to explore and find hidden items. Scavenging is a must!

There is some silliness in the setting, with oddly scaled items and some wonky looking stuff, but it doesn't detract much.  My only real gripe is that there doesn't feel like there's much benefit to picking up new weaponst. All of them seem to have the same stopping power with just variations in ammo capacity, sight picture, and maybe some other mechanic, like the glock being an auto-pistol. I wish things like the deagle had greater stopping power to trade off for the tiny magazine. I feel like the magnum revolver was better at one-hit killing at a distance, though. Not sure about that.  I definitely plan to go back and play through this again on a few different settings and try to get a better feel for the guns.

This game creates fantastic emergent gameplay; playing coop with a friend and need some ammo? No problem, get him to eject a mag and throw it at you so you can catch it!... Amazing game! can't wait for Arizona Sunshine 2 or whater the devs work on next.",

Took me about 4 hours to get through the campaign mode and tbh I did it in 2 sessions which is unusual for me as i normally only play for about an hour at a time.  All in all great game and definately value for money.",

Weapon aiming could be improved, but from what there is to chose from in the VR gaming world, this has been one of the best. Once VR games get more sophistcated this game will feel very basic, so it's pretty easy to just step in a start playing. However it's also fun and aesthetically pleasing enough that I could foresee returning to it. It's the first app I bought with my VIVE and still my fav. Overall it's a great, early, must-have VR offering.",
