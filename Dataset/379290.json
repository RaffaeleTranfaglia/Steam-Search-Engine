            "review_text": "This is a very interesting game that has abot as many pros as cons which has my desision on if it is a good game or not. I will start with the pros.  The graphics are in a very nice 8-bit form that isnt seen very often anymore.  The soundtrack is very nice and catchy, in fact I was humming it as I was writing this review.   The gameplay is very fun with a bunch of power ups to keep it interesting. You can also invite a bunch of your buddies over and they can join you   And now for the cons  The graphics can become a bit disorienting, especially if all the characters look very similar, they sometimes end up being the same color as your character. It gets really annoying.  There is a multiplayer, but it is NOT an online multiplayer, not even a local. It is not internet related at all. Which means you have to crowd a bunch of friends areound the keyboad that you likely only have one of to play this game, so you either just don' play the supposed fun multiplayer or you have to buy a few more keyboards and/or controlers  sometimes the gameplay doesn't make any sense at all, some of the power ups do nothing.    Well the way I see things a good ought weighs a bad so I am going to give this game a 7/10",
