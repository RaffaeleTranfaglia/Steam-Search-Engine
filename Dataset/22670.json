            "review_text": "The third part of the Alien Breed series, starting this third part will give a big Déjà vu of the second part. The intro and start-screen are pretty much the same but instead of green they used a orange/yellow theme. After a quick Google search i came to the conclusion that this part was released a little less than two month's after part 2.  As stated before the intro and start menu look exactly the same as part 2, after starting a new single player you get to see the re-cap of what happened. Again this looks actually like part 2, even the first minute was the same as the previous part. After the cut-scene you get to start and it again looks actually like A.B 2, i am not stating this is a good or bad thing but since i didn't like the previous part this just didn't work for me.  Level design is done with a great eye for details, allot of scenic sightseeing helps to enhance the orbital atmosphere. The in-game cut-scenes are i bit short in my opinion, since they look decent and some of the character designs are to be called quite unique i would like to see them for longer than 5 seconds... The HUD's change of colour works better since it's easy to see no matter whats in the background. The music is still pretty good but after playing five minutes i noticed that they cut the alien ambient sounds. Objectives in the main campaign are mainly going from A to B and activating a switch to proceed in the level and some backtracking.  Controls are still mainly for the twin-sticks and using a keyboard/mouse feels awkward and still has some issues with turning around to shoot an enemy that is hitting you in the back. The multiplayer/coop aspect and survivor-mode are still the same as part 2, the overall gameplay is nice but not my thing. Also instead of tuning the game after A.B 2 they kept everything the same, this could again be a good/bad thing but they could of optimize the keyboard controls.",

            "review_text": "This is an excellent way to waste a few hours. I was a big fan of the original game and so when this new and updated version came out I was pretty excited. From what I can remember of the 90's game, this seems to be pretty faithful to the original. Pick up a gun, kill aliens. Admittedly some of the mission tasks can be pretty repetitive, and the story.. exists... but thats not what this game is about. With the unreal engine behind it I sometimes felt that this is what XCOM would be if it was just the combat in real time. In any case, I enjoyed myself with this one.  8/10 0 Comments",

The intro and start-screen are pretty much the same but instead of green they used a orange/yellow theme. After a quick Google search i came to the conclusion that this part was released a little less than two month's after part 2.  First look into the game: As stated before the intro and start menu look exactly the same as part 2, after starting a new single player you get to see the re-cap of what happened. Again this looks actually like part 2, even the first minute was the same as the previous part.

Also instead of tuning the game after A.B 2 they kept everything the same, this could again be a good/bad thing but they could of optimize the keyboard controls.  This game gets a rating of 6,5, mainly because the game feels like a Déjà vu from the previous part.",

            "review_text": "Since all three games are exactly the same this is the same review as the other two games.  Not a great game but it has great weapons and really good graphics and very smooth gameplay. Why it's not a great game:  1: The biggest massive problem, CONSTANT AND NEVER ENDING FOCUS STEALING FROM START TO FINISH. Which really is not that prevalent in the first game but is a major problem in the second and third games. The game constantly, more than any game I have ever seen, even Resident Evil 6, steals focus from you during events to make the camera spin a little while zooming in and force you to watch the stupidest most mundane ♥♥♥♥ like a grate opening or a switch turning on or ANYTHING. It was like the developers found a little focus stealing trick and went way, way, way overboard with it. It is aggravating to astronomical levels and does not feel like you are playing a game but something where you get to play only sometimes when it lets you. Again, not so bad in game one but a massive problem in games two and three. 2: CONSTANT screen shaking from explosions. It caused me to have to play each game from start to finish with a non-stop bad headache. 3: The sound is very low. I have to turn my volume way way up when playing this game which is a big problem because of course I am not going to remember to turn it back down when I'm done playing so the next thing I do, like play music or play another much better game, blows my ♥♥♥♥ing ears off. 4: There are very few types of enemies. I think 5 or less. And even those 5 all feel the same. 5: The game is very, very repetitive. What you do in the first fifteen minutes is exactly what you do in every other minute of all three games. The game offers no variety at all, especially since all 3 games are mirror images of each other. 6: The environments from the start to finish of all games is all exactly the same from game to game. Even though each game takes place in a different area of the ship or I think on different ships maybe, all three games are completely identical. 7: All 3 games are very short, about 4 hours each. 8: Crashes/glitches. I don't think I had any trouble with the first two games, maybe one or two crashes in the second game. The third game has crashed three times now. Once early, then half way through it, and now near the end. Their forum pin says it could be a file validation to fix it, but who cares when the games have the other bad problems I pointed out. And YES I understand it is a problem on my end. But no other games crash so it is a problem on my end caused by something to do exclusively with this game in particular and none of the other 150+ games I have installed.  It's sad because the games graphics are outstanding and the gameplay is very, very smooth. But because of the main flaws being so incredibly bad, I can only recommend them if you can catch them on sale like I did for $5.65 for all 3 games. Their normal price of $10 each is laughable. Like throw your head back and audibly laugh loud. Once I play through them I'm never coming back to them, ever.  Since all 3 games are the exact same, only one score is needed. Production quality in some areas like graphics and control is 8/10, everything else 5/10. Overall, 5/10. Badly missed opportunity for a all-time favorite cult classic. Whoever made this is jarringly inept.",

            "review_text": "I’d be lying if I said that this review would be as negative as the other two games. Now, I may be suffering from Stockholm syndrome from continuously playing all three games in a row, but I find this game more enjoyable than the other two. I may actually even have to recommend it ;__;  The opening did not give us much to go off on—a monotonous comic strip will NOT capture the audience’s attention, especially when you’re trying to explain what has happened from Alien Breed 2. That’s my only real issue with the beginning. It seems that Team 17 did try to make a difference with their game. They did stick to the run-to-here-and-back game mechanic through the entirety of the game, but they threw in many more dynamic scenes and gameplay experience as far as ways in which you shoot aliens. Now that they’re raising Klein as your main antagonist, I find it a lot more enjoyable, especially when listening to his stereotypical German accent. &lt;3   Very ‘OK’ boss battles. I actually kind of enjoyed fighting the aliens, especially in the water scenes (which I can also appreciate). They also brought in a new type of alien that while I like, I also dislike. I feel that the Electro-shocker is a bit overpowered, and would have worked better if it could not actively fight on land, since that was what I assumed from the first few that I had encountered. It would have made more sense, because the game shows that electricity will hurt you if it’s spread above water.   And ooooh my god, the comic scene for the last chapter is so lovely. SO LOVELY. It’s just so sick and cruel and yet I can’t help but love Klein even more for being such an evil lunatic. I just LOVE it, even though I know I wouldn’t really enjoy his company in real life. I did not enjoy the ending.  Team 17 made this trilogy with the interests of making money only, after seeing interest in their Worms series starting to dwindle. They made and released all three of these games in the same year. A LOT of content was reused in the first two games, but I also see a lot more introduced into this final game. I’m not sure what got them to put in more effort into this last one, but I can say that it is OK. Not BAD, per say, but OK.   I’m not sure why this game got as much bad rep as the other two games, but I’d still say get this game when it’s discounted at least 75%, but if you were going to pick any of the three, play this one first.",
