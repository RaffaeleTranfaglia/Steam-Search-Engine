            "review_text": "First off I had no idea what I was getting myself into when I got this game. A really close friend of mine purchased it for me on a whim that I might like it since I recently came to loving visual novels and always loved games where you get to choose a route with different endings. This game is absolutely amazing. Yes, Yes It IS pretty steep compared to other visual novels. But I can say after playing this non stop since I got it is that I can safely say It's worth it. Honestly.   ~It has alot of replay value.  ~The music is Suberb.  ~Voice Acting is Perfect.  ~The art....My god the art. Simply love the art style.   Sure it has some flaws. Every game comes with flaws. Whether small or big. Regardless of that tho someone is always going to complain. You can't always please everyone. I've read that the subtitles have alot of errors from other reviews. But they didn't bother me. I didn't notice any errors too major. The story had me intrigued from the moment I began reading. Unlike a couple other visual novels where i lose interest very quickly no matter how hard I try to wait it out. (I get distracted and lose interest very easily sometimes.) This game touches on themes of loneliness, abandonment, self worth, self hate, and acceptance. These topics resonate, and they create an experience that is sure to stay with the player long after the game is finished. Just click, read, and enjoy. No stat building here.",

            "review_text": "After learning of the existance of Cheritz a few months ago and playing Dandelion, Nameless' predecessor, I found out about this game, Nameless ~The one thing you must recall~, and I knew once I had the opportunity, I would definitely buy this game. And so I did, after Christmas, when I had the money, I bought Nameless , and since, I have been playing it when I have the opportunity. I'd only wished I had found this game sooner - I am a huge otome fan, and it was one of the best experiences I've had with an otome game, and one of the best investments of my money in a video game, by far. Thank you Cheritz, you have made one customer very happy.  Nameless is a very interesting story, which begins with Eri (the main character, name changeable) and her dolls, living a normal life, until her world turns upside down and she finds her dolls ALIVE, as  humans . From this an intricate story unfolds which changes depending on which character route you are on. The full story itself akin to a puzzle - you only know the entire story and the truth when you have collected all the pieces (or in this case, finished all the routes). Some routes are even locked or unreachable until others have been completed, which you will understand once you start said routes, and I was glad they were locked before I headed onto them. There are even two secret endings only reachable after completing all the character routes. Each route is quite long, approximately 4 or 5 hours per route. Be warned, Cheritz is a company which jokes around sometimes, but definitely does not sugar coat stories; there will be times the story will force you into tears or make you shiver in terror. Anyone who has played Dandelion knows this, but even Dandelion fans should note that this is an even darker story than Dandelion. And there are many ways this game can end badly, which vary from mildly saddening to  absolutely terrifying . You will experience a rainbow of emotions as you proceed through the game, and you will probably need to stock up on your tissues. I know I had to.  People who have played Dandelion will notice one thing definitely different in Nameless in terms of gameplay, that this is a choice based game instead of a stat-raising based game, which may or may not affect your personal opinion on the game. Your choices are critical to the story, one wrong choice could mean a bad ending. Choices vary from extremely easy to pick what's 'correct' to extremely subtle or misleading choices which will easily stray you onto a bad ending. There are also little minigames, such as the inevitable quiz, and a card matching game. The quiz was extremely interesting for me, and I found some of the questions easy and ridiculously funny (I had one question pop up asking if the people who work at Cheritz are aliens XD), while others were actual facts, or regarded how much you paid attention to the game. These little minigames, luckily, are not extremely difficult. You will never find them a huge hinderance unless you are just skimming through the game without paying attention.  Now, onto characters; the characters were one of my favourite factors of the game. Each one of them I developed a personal opinion to, depending on my experience with them, varying from absolute love to not wanting to approach them at all. Each of the datable characters is one of her dolls and has a distinct personality, with their own strengths and flaws. None of them are 'perfect'. They all have their own issues which are personal, and exclusive to their route. And as the boys change, Eri changes too, in some way or another. Eri herself was a very relatable character for me, she's a high school student, conforming to social pressure whilst having a secret hobby which goes against 'norms' which she fears to reveal to anyone. She's a very average teenage girl when it comes down to it, the only thing not normal is her friends and acquaintances, even prior to her dolls becoming humans. And doesn't everyone have something that they want to hide from the world as it is considered 'not normal'?  The side characters were also good, each had their own little quirks, and were all unique in their own little ways. My favourite thing was how each side character was characterised, specifically her friends. Her best friends were not exactly like her, and this is what I enjoyed. They both had their own personality different to her own but 'clicked' in well. It felt like a real friendship, they didn't always agree on everything BUT they were supportive of each other. My only little rant with this is that in certain routes these side characters are very unimportant, and sometimes just seem like they were used as filler.  The graphics deserve praise; as soon as I started the game and saw the title screen, I saw how beautiful this game is. The shading, the design, the colours are all stunning and mix together really well. Nothing in design appears 'out of place'. And the CGs in this game are  gorgeous .  As you stare at graphics, you may also notice one more thing; references! This game is a cache of references, to Dandelion, company mascots and popular culture. They range from subtle to explicit, both in script and in visuals. It's a nice and amusing touch to the game for myself, having played Dandelion and absolutely LOVING it before this one. It should also be noted that although it is set in the same universe as Dandelion, it is not a sequel to said game; both newcomers who have never touched an otome game and experts who have played Dandelion and many other otomes will be able to enjoy this game without hassle. (Even so, I recommend playing Dandelion prior to or after playing this one as it is just a really good game!)   The music is also amazing, from the opening song to the background music. The music was well composed and pleasant to listen to. The backgound music for areas always suits the environment around them, and each of the main characters has a 'theme song' which entirely suits them. I also have to give praise where it's due for the fact that the opening and ending songs for the main character routes are sung by the actual characters' voice actors, in amazing duets.   Speaking of voice actors, they are very well done. Each character has their own voice tailored personally to them which really does suit them. It is expressed well and the actors sound devoted to the story and the character. It is in Korean only though. If this upsets you, you do have the option to turn off voices for the characters in options, so it should not be a disastrous problem so much.  Even with a game as good as this one though, it is not flawless. As an English translation of a Korean game, this first issue is to be expected. There are typos and spelling errors in the game, you have no idea how many times I snickered when first was spelt as fist, or window sill window seal. These errors are, luckily, easy to ignore and only rarely break your sense of immersion in the game. There are also a few glitches and bugs, however, these are not game breaking, but they may mildly annoy you.   Overall, Nameless was a spectacular success that I can definitely recommend to any otome fan. The game really shows how much the company has improved after releasing Dandelion, and I am eagerly awaiting their next game, but for now, I shall continue playing this one! Within the last couple of days of playing I have completed all good and secret endings, and quite a few of the bad endings, too. It may seem to be expensive, but the price tag is   definitely   worth the game.",

I'm incredibly touched and amazed by this game, I wasn't really convinced about my purchase at first but I had to rethink my thoughts because only after half an hour I was loving this game (and Lance, sorry not sorry), and the more I kept on going on the more I got interested in everything and...damn, the secret endings.  You just have to experience the feelings yourself.  The only critiques I feel like I have to give about Nameless are about the CGs that sometimes look kinda weird and off proportions and the numerous typos even in moments that are supposed to be touching, ruining the atmosphere a bit. I was also disappointed in not being able to understand what the voice-actors say in the bonus part, since I know nothing about Korean and I would love to understand what they have to say about the game and the characters.   But these things aside, the game is really enjoyable and I really loved it a lot. I will miss this game so, so much!",

            "review_text": "I know that, like me, many of you may be wondering if you really want to pay $30+ for a visual novel. Luckily, with Nameless, your incredibly emotional experience will be worth every penny.   It took me 22 hours to get all of the endings (using a spoiler-free guide - if not, it would take a lot longer, of course): there are 5 main pursuable characters, each with one good ending and 3-5 bad endings, plus a secret route. Unlike many visual novels, each character's route has a wealth of unique content, so you are not just playing the exact same thing over and over again to get one or two extra scenes.   I also found it to be one of the best-written games I have ever played -- I genuinely laughed and cried at the appropriate times. Although many of the characters initially appear to conform to VN tropes, the game will consistently surprise you by revealing hidden depths to the characters and by tying their backstories very well into their personalities. The voice acting is absolutely top-notch -- I don't understand a word of Korean, but I could still feel the emotion in each line. The art is also pretty gorgeous, especially compared to some of the incredibly hideous stuff that has somehow made its way to Steam.  For those of you who played Dandelion (Cheritz's other Steam release), Nameless does away with all of the stat-raising from that game but still manages to be a similar length, meaning there is (I think) a lot more dialogue and actual story content in this one. As I mentioned above, I found these characters to be generally more interesting than the ones in that game, and each route has more unique content, so playing through all of the routes doesn't feel like a slog at all. Basically, if you enjoyed Dandelion, pick this up without a second thought. If you didn't enjoy it, though, you may still end up loving Nameless.   In short: I, too, held off on buying this game for a while due to the price point, but I am ever-so-glad that I finally got it. Totally worth the money.",

The character illustrations are beautiful, and all the backgrounds (apart from one) were also drawn to a very high standard. They certainly contributed to how much I enjoyed the game. The music is also enjoyable, if a bit repetative, it serves to enhance the mood of each scene. I wouldn't spend money on the OST though.  [First Playthrough: Lance's Story]  I managed to finish Lance's story with one good ending and the two bad endings. Actually, the good ending was lovely and the bad endings were really disappointing. I just felt 'meh' about them. I will be playing Yeonho's story next. It's nice that with each ending (good or bad) you get little glimpses of the over-arching plot. That's a nice touch and increases replay value.  [Update: Yeonho's Story]  I actually really disliked this one. Yeah I get it, he's cute, abused and vulnerable. Except those last two really aren't attractive traits and here they have been greatly romanticised. The way the heroine acts towards him isn't right at all. She isn't helping him no matter what she does. And the bad endings... Well. What the hell? It made me extremely uncomfortable. And didn't make sense at all, actually. Messed up.  [Update: Yuri's Story]  I only just started this one but I already like it a lot better. The character is a pervert and seemingly in control of this emotions, so that's makes his deviousness more fun for me. It's the most enjoyable route so far for my preferences! After advancing through his story, I have to say it's my favorite playthough so far. Yuri has my vote for top boy (so far)!  And... I stopped there. Although the art is beautiful, the repetitiveness of the story (even with different romances) and the fact the main character became a terrible Mary Sue left me thinking I had other games to play. I especially couldn't stand her reactions in Yuri's story. I may come back to it one day, to complete Red and Tei's stories but for now I am giving it a rest.",

The storyline is absolutely amazing, it isn't just a boring 'Girl-Falls-In-Love-With-a-Boy-Thing', it's a game with a gorgeous plot and heartwarming characters. [I've totally fallen for Lance, and a little for Red and Yeonho btw] Every character has it's own deep story, and I'm still absolutely amazed by the fact, that all of these stories 'belong' together and form step-by-step [or, should i call it 'story-by-story'] another story, which is as great as the others.

            "review_text": "NOTE: I have played the off-Steam release in its entirety, but have yet to finish the Steam release. From my understanding there are no changes of written content between versions, so my review should still remain relevant.  Nameless is easily one of the most impressive otome games I've played in recent times. For those of you who enjoyed Dandelion, wait no further. Produced by the same company that created Dandelion, Nameless is much like a spiritual successor to the popular stat-raiser, even moving on to become something much greater that keeps you at attention the whole ride through.  So, what's the deal with Nameless? It's a dating sim that was created in collaboration with Crobidoll, a manufacturer of ball-jointed dolls. And relax, even if you're not familiar with that particular type of doll, you can follow the story with ease. The story retains the Cheritz touch, now adorned with beautiful pastel art and character portraits that blink smoothly.  Nameless features a plot that spans the entirety of the routes, following the tale of a girl and her doll. You'll be surprised to learn the intricacies that each of the (formerly ball-jointed) love interests hide within their heart; normally this fact alone would be sufficient for an intriguing story, but everything adds up to a fantastic and impressive finale that will milk your tear ducts dry.   ---   Lovely Art   The art composition is simply fantastic. The character sprites mesh well with the backgrounds and they complement each other to the point one may wonder if it was a happy coincidence or done purposely. The anatomy isn't much of a problem (though consistency can be a problem when comparing CGs), and the art accomplishes what it seeks to. The game establishes a wonderful atmosphere of its own through the attention put into the visuals.   Atmospheric Music   Discarding the hip and stylish music of Dandelion, Cheritz aims for a softer, gentle feel with the background audio for Nameless and it works without becoming dull. And of course, the BGM can easily boost up the tension when the scene calls for it (and boy, do some scenes call for it).   Besides the opening music for Nameless, there are also four ending songs (Lance&amp;Yeonho, Red&amp;Tei, Yuri&amp;Yujin, 'What's Your Name?').   Characters with Depth   I feel that the true strength of Nameless is in the depth of the characters and the interactions between them. Some characters hide more beneath their surface than others. But all of them are brilliantly written and have problems that need solving; the fact that they are dolls is not ignored, and adds a lot to their character that wouldn't otherwise be there.   Touching Story... with some small rough edges.   I had heard before purchasing Nameless that there was inescapable Fangirl Mobs, as it is, that surround every single member of the romanceable cast. And it's true! I do not recommend this game to those who cannot stand such things. The thing is, though I despise such things, how they interact with the Fangirl Mob shows, and causes, character growth. Because of this, I was able to overlook it.  Besides this plot device the story was, as I said before, probably the most enjoyable otome game I have had the pleasure of playing in recent time. It would be spoiling to explain its brilliance in detail, but the characters and how they all come together was executed fabulously. The story is more about developing the relationship so things end quite quickly after the couple gets together, which may be disappointing for some audiences.  There were bad ends where things felt too sudden, and/or even anticlimatic. On the other hand, there were also bad ends that added quite a bit of depth that wouldn't have otherwise been there (yay, worst-case scenarios!).   Convenient System   A straight VN not too different from a choose-your-adventure novel where you read the story and are faced with options that will lead you to different endings (to tell you ahead of time, there are several bad endings and one good ending per character route). All the characters are voiced except Eri, the heroine.  There is a diary feature in the right-click menu that conveniently summarizes and occasionally, adds depth to the events in the game for you. You can even flip through the pages. It's very useful for those who play erratically and must recall their stopping point, but this feature also plays a part in the plot itself.  There is an auto-save and even a whole page for your quick saves on the load screen, so you have little to fear in case your game crashes and you lose your spot. This was very convenient!  In the 'Extras' menu, you may go over the content you've covered in the 'Memory' and 'Album' section. This is quite the handy feature for whenever you want to view a scene again, but remember you can't use the right-click menu (and thus, cannot view texts nor the diary) as you would be able to in-game.  As an added bonus, this game is trilingual, allowing you to flip between Japanese, Korean, and English (you have to return to the menu when you switch, though).   A Bit Picky, But...   In terms of prose, the game was a bit lacking. I cannot be a judge of the translation as I don't understand Korean, but the writing could definitely improve. Especially for visual novels where the writing is one of the most important parts, I believe that fluid English is important. Most importantly, I think this game would benefit from an editor who is proficient in what they do; there was the occasional typo when I played the non-Steam version. I even noticed they would mention things that never happened since I chose a different choice.  As for SFX, well... there were times when it was a bit strange, but nothing too out of order.    Conclusion/Thoughts   Nice game with nice music and visuals and even nicer story. A must-play for people who don't have a phobia of dolls.",

You could imagine their comforting voices when you cried. Within them, you could make the perfect friend.  What if those toys came to life?  Cheritz's second game brings you into a beautifully drawn water-color world of love and possibilities as your character (Eri if you don't change her name) wakes up to find her five precious dolls have come to life. Each doll has their own personality, sometimes not as you may have imagined, and their own troubles and conflicts from not only on what it means for them to be a doll, but what it means to be human.  Nameless offers you many hours (25+) of gameplay and self-discovery as you journey through not only the boys' stories, but your own as well. The choices you make change the course of your story for better or for worse. Along the journey expect beautiful music scores that not only set the mood, but are great enough to just listen to on their own. To accompany the music, all characters (except yours) have wonderfully emotion filled voice overs for all dialogue.   This is not your average dating sim. This game means to not to merely tell you a story, but have you EXPERIENCE a story that everyone can relate to. You will feel a wide range of emotions and encounter your own memories as you play, so be ready to take a trip down memory lane. Don't worry, your toys are there to hold your hand along the way.",

You have to finish Tei's route to get to Red's route but the trio (Lance, YeonHo, Yuri) can be played by any order.   I recommend that you play Yuri first. Followed by Lance, then YeonHo, Tei and Red. This order creates a marvelous linear storyline.   Writing:   The writing is strong. The main concept and underlying plotline of memories (much like Dandelion) is well executed. You will not get tired of the story even with the multiple playthroughs you have to do for Yuri, YeonHo and Lance.  The interaction between characters really do show their personality. I for one was able to relate to Eri easily as she REALLY reacts like a typical teenage girl. That being said, her friends, Soi and Shinbi and other side-characters were given a good dose of character that is believable.  The way the story was written and that ending twist shows me how strong their storytelling are.   Art:  All the art were pastel coloured with that deep purple coloured UI as a foil really made everything pop to me. The care and effort that went into the art really showed! Though some CGs still suffer from the funny angles they are in, overall they have created a world which BJDs really did come alive. Thank you, Cheritz!  Everything was drawn except for Banjul's background which was an edited picture. Dunno why they chose to use an edited picture but I'm sure they had their reasons.   Music:   The music is soothing and yet haunting at the same time. It suits the art to a T. I love how it changes to create the desired atmosphere at the correct times in the game. I REALLY, really want their OST.   Voice Acting:  I LOVE THEIR VOICE-ACTING! It is refreshing to hear Korean voices in an otome instead of the usual Japanese. The emotions and personality really came through in the voice acting. My favourite was Yujin, believe it or not. Probably because his obsession for Beatrice really sounds believeable.   Final Thoughts:  Thereis so much that I enjoy about this game and there is so little I could put it in words. The themes of loneliness, abandonment, self-discovery, confidence and many more makes this game a visual novel that is on par if not better than most visual novels I have played before. Though it being a Cheritz game do not expect it to be all sunshine and roses for the happy end. Seriously.  The price may sound steep to a first time buyer but I assure you, it is all worth it!   Prepare your tissues and chocolates and comforting thing and dive into this game. There's a lot going for it and my review cannot do it justice.  4.9/5.0",

The art is amazing and even if I didn't like the game, I think the art is definitely worth getting the game for. As it is, the stories themselves are also really well written. The MC has realistic reactions to the sudden changes in her life instead of just instantly accepting them, which works very well for making the stories more believable. I've recommended the game to a few friends already and they love it as well. The gameplay is different from Dandelion and progress is more affected by the choices you make in the game instead of by the MCs stats.",

All around the story is very interesting. I liked the variety of characters, each with their own distict personalities. My favorite aspect of the game would have to be the voice acting. The actors in the game are phenominal. (especially Tei's).  Of course the game has a few problems. For example, you have to play certain character before others. However, that is understandable because it makes the story flow a lot better. And, unlike Dandelion, the MC is not voiced. I really miss that. However, the CGI's are beautiful, the music is great, and even the side characters are interesting. Overall, I really loved this game. It probably even topped Dandelion.",

I had my frustrations with Dandelion due to stat raising, but Cheritz seemed to also realize its faults and dropped that feature for this game. While the choices aren't necessarilly challenging as with other VNs I've played, the characters are well written and each has their own distinct routes. You also get additional insight into the side characters with each playthrough, as well as insight into the overarching plot keeping it constantly fresh and engaging. I still have a few routes to go, and at 15 hours clocked I definitely feel like this is well worth the price tag.",

Although I believe the story could have been written better for later routes, the voice acting was superb, the soundtrack was great, and the characters are likeable.

            "review_text": "My favs: Lance was my Fist Doll. Yujin getting more story with every play snuck in the common sections - be careful not to skip through his times. Yuri's attempts to hit on the main character in every route - He has more lines than the amusement park! Dolls have way more baggage than bunnies and kitties - the velveteen rabbit was a tea party compared to these guys. For some reason I'm always craving tea now...  My first full VN (Dandelion was my first stats VN) and really enjoying it. Almost to the secret ending, so 4.5 dolls down and 32 hours in with a fair reading speed and some skippage of common bits in Yeo's in case you want to know how long the game takes. Nice artwork and fewer mispells, though names did get mixed up a bit (not as bad as Dandelion).  Nameless has more drama than Dandelion, is darker and really progressed the story so you didn't have to go through the beginning 5 times. And some plot suprises.  I'd recommend follow the guides for the order of the dolls or the plotline might be a little confusing, especially with Tei and Red at the end. Don't need to quicksave as much as Dandelion and can find the bad routes easily, the good are fairly obvious. Steam Guide helped.  Now the big question is if I ever go to Seoul, do I go to the bird Cafe or Banjul?  -Update: Finished and wow. Makes me scared to think what my old My little Ponies might be up to. Considering the length of game time, I think this is definitely worth it.",

            "review_text": "FYI: The reason my play hours is coming up as so little on steam is because I purchased the game directly from the Cheritz website right when the game was released (back in November 2013). Good thing I wrote a review right when I finished the game, I needed to refresh my memories! Haha see what I did there? No? Well I tried to be clever and... uh moving on.   Nameless addresses many themes such as self-worth, acceptance, identity, honesty with one’s self and more. Each doll represents a theme in a way and that really makes each route heart warming. Cheritz handled these themes with utmost care and it delivers to the audience. I’m sure anyone can relate to at least one thing in this game and feel touched.  Writing: The story was well written. There were many hilarious scenes that I had to take breaks simply from laughing too hard. There were also many feel-inducing moments that were characteristic of Cheritz, which I also absolutely love. However, I must say that there were quite a few typos throughout the game. Though they did not take away from my enjoyment of the game, they were a bit jarring at times.  Art:  The art is definitely great as a whole. The sprites of each character were really nice. However, the art for the CGs were not consistent and while some were gorgeous, a few of them looked a bit strange. From the ending credits, I could tell that the CGs were made by more than one person, which sort of explains it. To be honest, it would have been nice if only one person did all the CGs as this would have allowed for more consistency. I also didn’t like how in a couple of CGs, Eri’s eyes were cut off or covered intentionally. While I prefer Dandelion’s art style a bit more, the soft pastel colouring suited the atmosphere of Nameless.   Voice Acting: All the voice actors portrayed each character well. They displayed a wide variety of emotions for every scene. I really felt the character’s personalities shone through their voices as well. But I wish Eri was voiced too. Heejung was voiced in Dandelion and I wish the same was done here.  Music: Again, I really have to praise Cheritz on their music. The OST is just gorgeous and every time I listen to a certain track, I get Nameless feels all over again. If I had to say one thing though, I must say I wasn’t a fan of the OP song. Regardless, I really liked the music in this game.   Characters: I loved every single character in this game. They all had their own quirks that were so unique to them. Each doll needed Eri in order to grow as a person. It also makes sense as to why each doll had twisted views. I mean, their world is so small as they were originally dolls after all. At the same time though, I liked to see that Eri also needed them as much as they needed her. It was a nice balance and seeing them grow together was really sweet.   Overall, Nameless is a great visual novel. I highly recommend it to any otome game lover out there!",
