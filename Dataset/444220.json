Please Note: The Freeness of this game did NOT impact the awesomeness of my review! ==== 8.4/10 - This game brings some redemption to the Space Shooter Genre.  You are a rough around the edges, drunken bounty hunter. When you aren't drinking yourself to sleep, you are out in space kicking some ♥♥♥.teroid!   Actual gameplay isn't anything epic but all the extra features are what make this game stand out! The game has several modes to choose from such as bullet hell and bounty hunter mode. It plays almost like an RPG where you cast different attacks and upgrade your character through a skill tree. I dig this!  The graphics are pretty sweet and the dubstep/electronic music adds a new and exciting feel to the old game of asteroids. This game has 25 levels and enough tracks to keep sounding fresh for hours! Even better yet, you can upload your own tracks into the internal music player to control your gaming experience further.  The only thing I didn't really dig was the controls. I had to remap the controls right off the bat and couldn't really get things exactly how I wanted. At minimum I wanted to be able to have my mouse serve as my gun for more fluid gameplay but wasn't able to make that happen. I also wasn't able to utilize my prized steam controller. I'd love to see this added at as well.  I'd pay the full $8 for this game; it exceeded my expectations in all aspects!     Accidently Reviewed",

I enjoyed the gameplay, generally loved the visuals (I liked the character art for the cut scenes, and I'm a sap for spacy backgrounds in general; the blue background star + blue boss weapon on one level -was- mildly annoying though :p ), and enjoyed the music enough that I'll likely listen to it a bit more once I'm done with the game (which admittedly won't take long).   And on a side note, I appreciate the mild 'drunken-yet-perfect hero' subversion regarding the character's dog, Karma (see 2nd trailer video).",

User Interface: Like one of our early flash4-websites, you press back when upgrading your ship and boom there is the main menu. Where is my mouse - how can i navigate? Ah press the right mouse button to activate it. A world full of surprises.   The graphics: The credits start with some creative commons music tracks. Apparently no art director involved.

I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.' I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.",
