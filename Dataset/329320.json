One day I woke up and there were no sky above, Not a single cloud, not a single cloud, Something beautiful may happen, When I solve all the planets. One day I woke up and there were no sky above, But if I can find way to create new world, Maybe I could rest then or at least not to be alone",

            "review_text": "Pros: +great soundtrack +familiar, challenging, interesting +nice aesthetics  Cons: -no means of building a strategy, which takes away from the puzzle aspect of it -rotating the planet (the crux of the game) isn't smooth with the keyboard. its a little better with the mousewheel. havent tried the gamepad just yet but I'm hoping that's the smoothest.  my biggest gripe with this game is that there's no intuitive/smooth way to rotate the planet...which is the main control mechanic. It's not unplayable, just frustrating, and requires the player to have extreme finesse with keystrokes/mousewheels. You know what would make it better? click &amp; drag to rotate, spacebar to drop  Unlike tetris, this game requires you to be precise with 2 aspects when placing blocks: rotation and gravity, whereas tetris just has the gravity aspect. this is a curse and a blessing because while it adds a layer of complexity, it also adds a layer of frustration if you've lined up a great match, but move your mousewheel up a tiny bit, making the whole move useless. it's similar to the feeling in tetris when you slam down a stick piece only to have it be off by 1 block and instead of racking up points, you now have a mess to clean up. HOWEVER, in tetris, that's 100% your fault. in this game, other factors like mouse wheel sensitivity and randomization come into play. combine that with no indicator of whats coming next, and sometimes this game feels a bit unfair. Less intellect based, and more luck/reflexes.   Would be a much better game if they had at least the option to have an incoming drop indicator, to adapt to different play styles   I can't say that this is my favourite puzzle game, or that I'll even go back to it very often. but I definitely feel like the pricepoint is fair. It's a challenge, that's for sure. just sometimes not for all the right reasons.",

            "review_text": "First-up - I love how it looks and sounds and if it was just a BIT better designed as a puzzle, it would be great.  It has a stack of issues tho - most of which mean it comes over as too-random/a crapshoot.  We need SOME idea of the 'next piece' as with Tetris, without that the game has zero strategy  Same-color-pieces which would have made a combo break-off and don't always get matched - this is really naff (Tetris matches on hit - and again on split)  The game gains speed quickly but movement speed slow so after no-time you'll have NO chance of moving a piece before it hits and it's game over (again, Tetris worked around this well)  We NEEED a 'reverse controls' option - even after a dozen games I was still moving the wrong way!  Please enable the sticks on a pad - the DPad is worse than using the keyboard!!  tl;dr looks nice, sounds nice but doesn't play that well right now",

Basically its dr. mario with so much twists and effects that it's no longer easy to pick-up.",
