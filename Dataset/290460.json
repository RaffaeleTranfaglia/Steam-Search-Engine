I guess based upon the fact that I've played for 10+ hours and haven't thrown in the towel would count as a recommend. This game has a lot of flaws, so play at your own discretion.   Pros",

That battles are hard, and not just click click click. You have to use defense and well as offensive spells for even the earliest of battles. It wont let me leave the mine to buy any health potions, or heal my dead character. Very bad design in not letting me leave the whole mine unless I kill the boss first. I am at level 9 and last save was when I was level 3. I am not starting over again. The developer contacted me yesterday and sent me a new save file, he also said that the next update would fix this problem. I can now get back to playing, and I am thankful to Steam and dark gaia for listening and fixing my dilemma.",

            "review_text": "I just finished the game and although I did enjoy it and the battles were very challenging, a great improvement over Legionwood 1's battles which were pretty simple strategies.  Unfortunately the story just failed to grab me, I kept thinking 'Right beat that boss, soon the map will open up and the story will start to make sense - Oh no wait I just finished it. Huh.'  The ending is... abrupt to say the least. I got what I believe to be the best ending of the game, Reboot A. Where a stable time loop is formed which sets up the next game's Plot - Heroes of Legionwood. But also makes everything I did be reset. So... Yay? I guess?  I did enjoy the game, Its well made. Its just the story failed to grab me like the first Legionwood: Tale of Two Swords did.  Still lthat game was free and this one was cheap so I feel like I got my money's worth by far ^_^",

Even the first town is one of the pre made ones, which seems REALLY lazy and sloppy. The dialogue is simple and unappealing, they didn't even bother to add faces to half the dialogue even though I know it is possible. If you don't care about this, by all means, go right ahead, but if you care about playing an RPG that is actually good and has a good story don't bother and buy something that isn't a waste of your money.  3/10",

            "review_text": "I am a little dissapointed about this game.  Its nothing like an epic quest. In fact its a very short game (under 10 hours for the first gameplay) and don't even start with the ending(s). The idea of mixed skilled classes is useless because the possible skills are mostly useless. This is the first RPG I played without a mage and cleric. Fights...yes there are many random ones but you can skip them with running or equip a trinklet that stops them completely. You don't need the exp. or money because in fights just use one of the drop agility skills in combination with poison and even the endboss never gets to hit you.",
