            "review_text": "This game surprised me, and got me into the Frogwares Sherlock Holmes games. I originally played it on Xbox 360 as a rental when it released, the Title caught my interest. Turned out to be a game I loved so much I bought it again on Steam. The PC version is far superior with the exception of the following, but don't let it sway you away, it can be corrected. It's not a broken game any means, just needs help on newer hardware when you first install. Some users (like myself) have an issue with the game mot loading initially: for most people this can be easily corrected by opening the game's folder ('C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\SteamApps\\common\\Sherlock Holmes versus Jack the Ripper\\Support\\PhysX') and re-installing the two PhysX installers, and selecting the repair option if asked to by the installer for each one.  Now.. about the game. This game has good performance and plays well on a rig that pumps 30 or 60+ FPS. The game looks great too. It may not blow you away graphically, but you can see the developers cared about quality. Little things - like tiny signs pasted to a brick wall are clear and easy to read, the smoke in pubs is realistic, the lighting and shadows are nice and mood-setting: little things like this you will notice as you play. I like this game's style.  The game does have a few places where you can tell they were developing on a budget. Some of the NPC characters walking the streets are recycled, and so are their voices. To top that, the NPC townsfolk have some pretty lame voice overs. However, don't let this stray you! If you play the game like a proper Sherlock Holmes would, you'll soon find out these people are of no use to you, and just ignore them and focus on the case. The good news here, is that the NPC characters you have actual dialogue with in the game, all have pretty good voice acting. I actually like this balance, it made me laugh at the cheesy peasants in the streets as I strolled along to talk to my fancy doctor, merchant, and police colleagues and such. This gave me a real feel for the classic Sherlock Holmes arrogance, lol. Also, you get to have a laugh at prudent Wason in a brothel in the middle of the night, if you are into the books and know his character.  The story isn't half bad either. I really liked the ending. Sure, if you want to be a real nit-picker or snob you could point out all it's imperfections... but you'd just be robbing yourself of a fun game that really did try to stay true to the source material and history, while providing a unique twist to preserve continuity.  Play this game.",

            "review_text": "I joined Steam recently and this was one of the first games I purchased. I have since completed the game and I love the depicted Victorian era and British English.  Growing up reading Sherlock Holmes novels, his methods of deduction remains elusive to me. This game guides you to solving the mystery from a first-person perspective of Sherlock Holmes or Dr. Watson.  I have read reviews lamenting that the game play leans more towards running errands for NPCs. But I think it introduces the player to the NPCs. And running errands build up trust between them, hence the inclination to provide information that they otherwise would not tell the police.  In particular, the story is congruous with the alleged crimes by Jack the Ripper in Whitechapel. The ending is great and characteristic of Sherlock Holmes' eccentricity. All in all, the story unfolded at a pace that kept me tether to the screen. Good job, Frogwares!",

Sure, you still have some of the now cliched puzzles involving items or sliders, but the focus of the game is DETECTION, because Sherlock Holmes, they realized suddenly, is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed detective. So you put together timelines, draw on maps, organize suspects, steal evidence, go over pages and pages of documents -- it's great, and you really FEEL like you're solving a mystery, unlike most mystery adventure games where you're solving a 15 puzzle.   Buy it.",

So in an effort to correct this, I started playing Versus Ripper without much pre-knowledge of what the gameplay or quality of the game was actually like. Oh boy, was I in for a surprise?  I loved this game. Although some of the production values may now be rather dated, I feel that they added to the charm. The puzzles weren't difficult, but just hard enough to make you feel that you actually had something to solve. While the voice acting over all was nothing compared to a AAA nowadays, the characterizations of Holmes &amp; Watson perfectly fit into everything you could wish for. The Ripper story itself took a fascinating perspective on the historical events.  Apparently this is one of the best of the Sherlock games, so it's all downhill for me from here (though I'm definitely going to play through the whole series), but I would wholeheartedly recommend this to anybody that likes point and click adventures, murder mysteries, or just generally doesn't need AAA production values to appreciate a game.",

            "review_text": "This Sherlock Holmes adventure game is a step above the previous entry from these Developers, 'The Awakened' but ultimately it is still frustrating, awkward, and unfun.  I love adventure games and Sherlock Holmes, so I was feeling pretty motivated to slog my way through the slow or frustrating parts, but in the end the problems with the game defeated me.  Firstly, I had the same problem that I experienced with The Awakened, in that every time to load up the game, I freeze at a black screen for about 5 minutes, though the game plays well after that. I tried all the suggested fixes from the forum, including copying PhysX DLL files to the game's directory, but I was never able to solve this issue.  The gameplay itself is alright, but you will find yourself mostly doing petty fetch quests, and solving poorly-explained, awkwardly designed puzzles. There's also the issue that often crops up when games are developed by non-English speakers, as some of the writing is just odd, sounds off, or in some cases just plain don't make sense.  Lastly, you can switch between first and third person to navigate the world, which is good, since something about these Frogrwares games gives me immediate nausea in the first-person persepective.  I wanted to like this game, I tried to like it, but in the end I had to admit I don't like it very much at all.",
