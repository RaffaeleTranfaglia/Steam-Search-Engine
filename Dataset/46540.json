If the makers had cared, it would have been one of the best games on the net. As it is, it's fun despite it's flaws. Just don't split up your party if you don't need to, since the micromanagement and lack of AI only rear their ugly heads if you're having to be in two places at once.",

If I would compare the difficulty to another game, it would be Dark Souls.   My friend Silun don't think it's very nice game, but it's because he dieded all the time, not giving game a chance.

From randomly taking damage to characters who are not bleeding nor have zombies around them in any way shape or form to what can only be described as desyncing multiplayer. The multiplayer does NOT make up for this horrible game because you and your teammate will simply not be playing the same game. Doors they open will not open for you and vice versa which does not mean either of you are safe because you will simply be killed by zombies you dont see but your friend will. God I could go on and on about this horrible game but read the forums there isnt a single good review about this game even if it were heavily discounted.",

It ruined however by stupid controls (if the developers had looked at the controls or played the game for 5 seconds it wouldve been obvious), which is my biggest problem. the game crashes a lot but eventually it gets going. but i just cant play a game where the controls just make it hard. im ok with hard games, ok games, and easy games. i like games with all different kinds of difficulties. i am not ok when a game is hard because the controls are just badly though out. not to mention the games buggy and pretty repetitive too...i didnt really see anything new happening. also i really hate that medkits simply stop bleeding instead of healing. its not the fact that i think the game NEEDS healing because if the controls werent so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ horrid the game wouldnt be super hard. but i feel like the description was misleading for it...besides this long wall of text about medkits and controls that make me want to punch my laptop, the game is buggy and the gameplay gets repetitive (partially because of the controls...again srly) but it has potential. hopefully they decide to make inprovements. for now ive refunded the game because i just played a better game that i bought for less @_@",

However by the third level (prison) - I had killed roughly 60 zombies, - mostly with the baseball bat but I had such an issue controling my char during combat.  I decided I did not want to play anymore when I had wounded 2 zombies with a gun. Tried to equip my bat... my charactor threw it on the floor. Then I picked it up and equiped it. Clicked the zombie to hit it, but because of the messy door physics. My Charactor decided to spin in a circle, then swing. I yelled a profrantity, and decided I didn't want to play this game.  This is a top down, point and click style combat. Think Fallout 1-2 combat, but in real time instead of turn based. The controls and the camera make it feel difficult to control, open, fight, ect: I see what they were trying to do with the game and I get it, but I did not enjoy the controls.   To be fair - I did not play it mutiplayer.... I guess it is easier when you have 4 people with crappy controls.",

Buggier than Skyrim during a particularly hot summer, this title is likely not worth anybody's money.   When the game isn't lagging severely due to what can only be assumed to be an overall poor optimization, it's controls are equally unresponsive. When the controls do respond, it starts glitching out on the pathing. When the pathing doesn't have you running in circles, it will just decide to stop moving, at random. The ancient Warcraft RTS games were more functional by comparison.  Granting your Steam profile a few more levels through crafting five relatively cheap badges is likely the best part of this game. It certainly was for me. But I certainly wouldn't recommend buying it for that purpose. The multiplayer's dead, the game's unsupported, and it's basically a pile of crap which shows how not to get sucked into a zombie survival game for zombies alone.",
