Postal 2 Complete has been greenlit by the community, which either means that its now better than ever or that we’ve all completely lost our minds.  After playing the game again, it would seem as though the latter is true.  In Postal 2, you are given a number of errands that you must complete each day. While the errands are similar to what most of us would call “missions”, their objectives are often much more simple than the missions we’ve become accustomed to in RPGs and other titles. In a testament to this, one of the first errands you have to run is to go to the store and get some milk. The atmosphere of the store is hilarious, as the middle eastern music blasts and the shopkeeper insults all of the patrons in his shop. The brilliance of Postal 2 is the non-linear manner in which you can complete your errands. Do you just pay for the milk or do you just grab it and then fight your way out of the store, hitting everyone in your path with a shovel? The choice is yours. I should warn you though, the shop keeper is packing serious heat.",

However, if you have any common sense (and a sense of humor) it’s pretty clear that Postal 2 is simply a satire of American paranoia and ignorance. You play as the Postal Dude, aiding him as he completes a list of tasks over the course of a week. As you go about your business, you’ll notice increasingly crazy things happening all around you, such as anti-violent video game protestors who seem to love trying to kill you, trigger-happy police officers, hillbillies who apparently love the movie “Deliverance”, and more. It’s all very ridiculous and over the top, but that’s exactly the point.   Postal 2 is crude, extremely violent, outrageous, and lots of fun. Avoid if you’re easily offended. Otherwise, go postal.",

Anyway, game's good, can be a massive time waster without even realizing it. It's like watching a train-wreck with explosives and deaths and fires and... more explosives. It's impossible to look away once it starts. You'll be glued to it forever. The weekends are the longest ones, however, than Mon-Fri. I thought Sunday would never end.  I've had a few issues of crashing here and there... not sure what exactly is causing them, but was purely random and at least rare. Too much going on at once?  It's worth the price.

The game is of course offensive, but it's very funny, and even though on the surface it may appear to be offensive for shock value, there are actually messages and commentary behind the very offensive stuff (for the most part.) Postal 2 is funny, however, for more than scripted scenes; the random shenanigans that can happen in the open world can be quite amusing and fun to watch, especially doing something like kicking someone, having them pull a gun on you, then have them (and possibly the whole town) get into a fire-fight with the police. The story in Postal obviously isn't the important part, it's simply a big fetch quest around the town of paradise, however it's not hard get lost on the way there, as it's easy to get caught up in the fun of slaughtering people. The game has a wide selection of weapons, which makes attacking random civs and police interesting. Some weapons such as the pistol, baton, shotgun, and assult rifle are common, while some are area specific, rare, and for the most part more interesting. You can get an axe to hack at peoples limbs. If they survive a hit to the arm, they run around screaming until you finish them. Or how about a can of gasoline, to light anyone you want on fire? Burning someone causes them to run around in circles, igniting anyone or anything they touch, eventually (unless killed or extinguished first) they collapse in a pile of searing charred flesh, barely clinging to life, free to be kicked to death as you please. But the best weapon in the game is one you start with: urine. The ability to ♥♥♥♥ on people, believe it or not, is one of the most powerful weapos, as it causes people to stop what they're doing and rub their face. Or, if you get lucky, they might puke and completely stand still for 5 seconds or so, leaving you plenty of time to kill them. Postal's gore is awesome, and with so many varied ways to kill (My favorite is hacking all of someone's limbs off, burning them to a crisp, then as they beg for you to end it, kick them until they explode) you never feel bored travelling between areas. Definetly ignore whatever stupid 0/10 reviews you see, this game is awesome! Oh, and it's still getting updates, which means you can bet on even more cool content coming.",

The game starts with a Monday 'without any obstacles', but when you come to the RWS office, you will have to fight against your worst gaming enemy: your parents. During the progress of the game you will have to fight much worse enemies, like slaughters, law enforcers and 'ALLACHU AKBAR' screaming people. And zombies. So let's talk about the weapon choise in Postal. Before talking about hkw OP the chainsaw is (the saw is the law :D) you have a really big choise o' guns. From a basic Desert Eagle, up to a mini-nuke, which preety reminds me FO4.   !Spoiler Alert!  In the last 3 days of the game you will get very angry of snipers, lil' Gary Colemans, rocket launcher 'guys' and surely grenade launcher b4astards. On the bright side this will get you a tone of fun. Yea, talking about the last boss... my game crashed like 4 times when he was at like 100 hp, but I bet it out.  So, right now I'm playing the Paradise Lost DLC. One of my friends says that it is like FallOut 4! I hope it will be.  I rate this Post-Apocaliptical-Zombie game a solid 8/10. A good advice: don't download ♥♥♥♥♥-mods to improove graphs and don't play the game on below than very hard difficulty.",

The people who find it ''Offensive'', may or may not know it's a comedy/satire, and take everything personally. The ''Gross-Out Humor'', is not as common as critics exaggerate.   After the previous game where he kills everyone in town,''Postal Dude'' moves to Paradise, Arizona with his darling morbidly obese wife. The only problem I had with this is that in the ending of Postal 1, has The Postal Dude get a psychological breakdown, then end up in a mental hospital. Everything about that is forgotton. Anyways, The Dude's wife nags him to do common errands, like buying some milk from a ethnic store. There are many outcomes to this.  1.Buy the milk like a legal individual, and get insulted for being, ''unclean''. 2.Shoplift the milk, which activates security, and fight Habib and the terrorists in the building. 3.Get the milk, and kill everyone. 4.Shoplift the milk, and find a secret underground area where mutant dogs try to kill you. 5.Shoplift the milk, run upstairs and break through the window like a badass.  Of course, the law enforcment can arrest you for being a Maniac. You Could:  A: Kill him. B: Bribe him. C: Accept your arrest. D: Run away. E: Stand there like an idiot and get killed.  Your actions have consequences, so be wise before ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ everywhere.  There are more than ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and cussing, so give this game a try.

Released back in 2003 it still holds up after 12 years, both gameplay and entertainment wise. Postal 2 actually supersedes a lot of current releases when it comes to it's fluid physics for water, gasoline and even the p-i-s-s physics.   The Steam version of Postal 2 includes the core game of Postal 2, Postal 2: Share The Pain (The Multiplayer Component), Postal 2: Apocalypse Weekend (an expansion pack for the original Postal 2 released back in 2005 which adds Sunday and Saturday), and finally Postal 2: A Week in Paradise (A mod developed by Resurrection Studios which adds the ability to play through both the core game of Postal 2 and Apocalypse Weekend in one sitting, with additional weapons such as the Chainsaw).  If you want the Eternal Damnation mod you will either have to pick up The Fudge Pack (which also includes Postal 1, and other additional content like game trailers released prior E3), or download it for free and install it as an addon for your Postal 2 Steam Version of the game. This also doesn't include Akella's officially unofficial Штопор Жжот addon released back in 2005.  Share The Pain could USE some (a lot actually) updates, it doesn't seem it has been updated ever since it's release as freeware in 2008; resulting in terrible connection problems, frequent disconnects, and barren list of servers. But Postal 2 is all about the Singleplayer experience, however, a mod or an expension implementing Co-Op would be a long-awaited and a welcome feature, allowing you to play the entire week with your friends would be a blast and add a lot of hours to anyone's playthroughs with additional replayabilty value to it's Singleplayer 'campaign'.  The game overall runs at a steady framerate, whether you're playing it on a PC or a Mac. The only issues I had were some hard crashes of the game due to some missions getting stuck and the entire Steam client crashing - but with constant auto-saving this isn't a big issue.   Overall, this is a great game and still gives me a massive nostalgia boost.",

It's very likely that it will always be that way, as no other developer has the balls to create such a piece of video game putrefaction. Its entire existence is solely based on enduring some of the most politically incorrect, disgusting, and shocking scenes ever programmed. As you should expect, it's a comedy game that doesn't really give a ♥♥♥♥ about its 'videogameness'. Nearly 100% of the development was spent on the shocking comedy aspect, and not much on gameplay. Typically, I do not enjoy those types of games, as I prefer my comedy games to at least still be a good game. But POSTAL 2, gameplay wise, only fails in a few areas.  In terms of open world exploration, scripted events, environments, and basically everything that makes a great open world game, POSTAL 2 excels extraordinarily. However, in terms of FPS mechanics... POSTAL 2 is severely lacking. Hitboxes are jacked up, weapons are unbalanced, everything is just a mess. It isn't too bothersome, but still one of the things that wounds this game from being taken seriously.  POSTAL 2 also has a large amount of typical gameplay bugs... but it seems that RWS wants it this way. I mean, after nearly 13 years of semi-consistent updates and rereleases, you would have expected them to fix it, right? Admittedly, these bugs are sort of funny when they happen, and they do give somewhat of a replay factor, but there's no excuse for poor game design.  Speaking of replay ability, this game has loads of it. It features an absurd amount of difficulties, different ways to complete missions, large open world environments, lots and lots of secrets and easter eggs, 88 clever achievements, and much more.  If you play through the full game, there are 7 days. Unfortunately, POSTAL 2 loses steam on the 6th day. What made the first 5 days great was the hilarious jokes, open world, everything that I previously mentioned. But on the 6th and 7th days, it's like they gave up and just put in a bunch of grindy filler that isn't really that funny or rewarding, it just makes you want to finally complete the game.  Overall, I had and will continue to have a lot of fun playing POSTAL 2, but as a game it isn't too great. The amount you will enjoy this game really varies on your video game preferences. I recommend it, but take causion, as it might not be for you.  6/10 - Good",

            "review_text": "Alright, so straight off the bat, when you start up the game, it warns you not to play it if you're young, disgusted by violence in general, or plan to take a career in politics. Let's just say that if you wanna run for governor, don't be surprised if you're kicked out of the state. Or shot ironically.   Getting that out of the way, POSTAL 2 takes place in sunny, desert wasteland Paradise, Arizona. You can tell they did their research because half of the video game self-inserts have huge machineguns carried around wherever they walk, just like in America. You play as a pessimistic delivery man who only finds comfort in his dog because his wife is a disembodied voice, unless you buy Paradise Lost. Now, as soon as you get kicking, its clear that the game is that of a magnum opus level, you have so much freedom of choice straight off the bat. You can invade the neighbor's house in front of you, pick up a shovel, you can hit your dog, your only friend, you can use the restrooms outdoors, it's quite a scene to behold.   Unfortunately, because Postal 2 was made a decade ago, you cannot complain about the subpar graphics because it doesn't make sense, you graphic obsessed dog-hater. The vulgarity in the game is also pretty unsettling to those who get their underwear twisted in the wash easily, being the oblivious person I am, I accidentally bumped into a woman who yelled, 'Look out' at my face. Such rudeness! I only slammed into her at walking speed on accident!   But in conclusion, I have to say that while somewhat disturbing to play, that is, if you have the sanity level of a horror game character in the dark, it's good, clean, bloody, morbidly humorous fun. I highly recommend it to anyone who does not own a firearm in real life, and slightly less but still recommend it for its fun to any triggerhappy gun enthusiast who likes practicing in shooting ranges on the weekend.",

            "review_text": "Another game that would really benefit from a 'mixed' recommendation.   This is a hard game to rate, because it's based on the player more than the game. But there is a game behind it that needs to be reviewed.  So the game is an old 13 year old game (released in 2003 so the future people have the actual time scale). When Postal was popular with the mass murdering gameplay, Running With Scisssors worked on a sequel, and took their time, 6 years later, Postal 2 came out, and it's certainly different.   3d graphics versus an isometric game, story instead of random murder, and actually a very different tone as well.   The problem is similar to other games it hasn't aged amazing. 13 year old 3d technology is quite interesting to see. At the same time, Postal 2 is unlike any other game, and that's both a positive and a negative.   Postal 2 tries very hard to be edgy, but it does so in a way that definitely makes it almost a time capsule. Putting muslim suicide bombers in the game in 2003, was extremely tasteless, now... Not as much? Osama Bin Laden's name is in the game, is that edgy any more? Shooting bullets through cats (in oddly enough not as tasteless a way as someone would do now)   I think a majority of the humor of the game has actually fallen away. I mean there's a voting joke and it's referencing the 2000 election... It's actually a little funny, but that's one kind of humor you're going to get. The other? Well there's a way to pee on, anyone you want. You have a very juvenile humor in this game, and yet it kind of works on some level.   The thing is the entire game tries VERY hard to be edgy, so if you can be offended, you will be. Almost every woman is big breasted, and I don't mean 'there's a lot of Buxom characters'. No, there's like ONE female player model and it's a big breasted woman, there's two males that I noticed, a skinny and a fat guy. If that's going to offend you you're going to get ♥♥♥♥♥♥. The only Muslims in the game are the terrorists/taliban who will attack you on sight, if you're going to be offended, you'll have a problem. The list goes on. If you can get offended, this game will try to find that button.   But overall, I mean it's insults from 2003, that kind of don't hit any more. I don't know, I can't really be offended by it, because it's made to offend, not because it's an honest opinion expressing itself.   There is a bit of cognitive dissonance when you get to the trophies as they were added recently. There's numerous references to both the League and It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia as well as other recent pop culture in the trophies. It's actually a weird touch, but you know what? It kind of helps.   As for the technical parts of the game, the majority of the game works perfectly, with the exception of the sound. Ugh, the sound. I'm going to guess this was the beginning of 3d sound technology, and maybe something's changed since then, but the main character speaks VERY loud, and every other important character is near impossible to hear. A shame.  I could go into more, but honestly. If you want to see what got a lot of people's panties in a bunch in 2003 this is a perfect game for that. It's not an amazing game, it's not going to blow you away. This isn't going down in the hall of fame of gaming (except for its attempt at offensiveness) but I've played a lot of worse games, and Postal 2 seems to understand it's not a top tier game and has priced themselves at a realistic number.   Overall there's a game that works well (though I did see a few crashes). It's both incredibly playable and interactive. It actually has a lot of choice involved in it (you can beat the game without killing anyone or ignore the story and go on a murder rampage, the game allows both options). And with the exception of the sound issue that was an annoyance, it's still a solid game.   If you're unsure, I would probably not recommend the game, but for what it is, it's a positive gaming experience. Just be sure you know what you're getting into and aren't going to get offended by 13 year old jokes (that are probably also aimed at 13 year olds)",

I don't.   share the pain is traditional multiplayer using postal weapons, and it works surprisingly well, despite having some differences that the original doesn't- namely guns having vastly more recoil and less accuracy.  apocalypse weekend is a more linear expansion, but it serves as a suitable conclusion to the game itself.  recently the game has been updated for the first time in ten years(!) which adds the 'week in paradise' mode. weapons from the mod eternal damnation &amp; from the apocalypse weekend will spawn, no mods required.",

Postal 2 - Paradise Lost DLC - Ive never played a dlc for a game like this , its generally classed as the sequel to postal 2 and until you start to play u wont understand why considering there is a Postal 3 ( which the devs 'running with scissors' co-developed with another company and didn't hit the same feel as previous games ) , the dlc is like a whole new game not just an addon with a few tweaks. The map and the game engine haven't changed drastically but its enough to make u feel like its worth while. Definitely a must own for those who completed and enjoyed Postal 2.  Downside to Postal 2 and the DLC - has to be that there are a lot of loading scenes in between parts of the town which the game makes you go back and forth between regularly .

The game only takes a few hours to beat, unless you make it a point to kill everyone you see along the way, which I did. My only complaints worth mentioning are that there is only a somewhat small assortment of weapons and, thus limited ways to kill people. Having something that could disembowel someone woulda been fun, for instance. I could think of other ways to kill that'd be cool, but you get the point. Also, being able to torture people in different ways would have been a good addition. I wish violent games on the whole would get just a bit more nasty. This game has the right idea.

The real reason I bought it on Steam, however, was for the achievements.  Normally I couldn't give a flying fudgesicle about achievements, but this game not only gives you an achievement for peeing on someone until they puke, but also one for drinking your own pee. Add another one for 'luring a police officer with a píss-soaked donut,' and you've pretty much exceeded your pee quota for the week.  Oh yeah, the non-pee related parts of the game are pretty fun too.  Buy Postal 2. Buy it now.  I can say without hesitation that urine for a good time!",

I have to admit, even though the story was not as good and the graphic could be improved, but I had absolute fun playing this game, this game really does the job on entertaining you and enjoying simplify just being silly in the Paradise AZ. A final point I like to make is that maybe, maybe the game is a little too expensive for its actual value. As you can see, it is $9.99 for a single copy, but you only can play for a week (In the game) and you finish the game, you have to do objectives for 7 days and it took me around 20 hours to finish the game (Of course, there are people that completed faster than that). So I would recommend this game when it’s on sale.   Thank you for reading my view of this game and decide wisely!  ",

You play as some guy with the most creative name ever to grace video games: 'The Postal Dude'. The way the story works is you get a list of errands each day. They sound really dull, you do each one, and once you've actually finished a task, something disastrous happens around you and you have to escape. It's quite difficult at times, while never really becoming frustrating (I play on Insane-o difficulty - this game has a bizarrely large selection of difficulty settings).

You break in houses, slaughtering everything you see, stealing their sh*t and most importanty - their weapons. Trust me, only in this game beathing anything to death with anything you have is as satisfying as blowing a vampire's head off with a blessed armour-piercing, thirteen-millimeter bullet, fired from a massive, gunmetal construction, 16 inch, 35lbs Jackal, which sadly isn't included in the game. Oh, did I also mention that you can also throw sh*t at people? No? Well, as far as I saw you can throw grenades, molotovs, dynamites, and most importantly, scissors! You can literally throw one and watch as it bounces around the room, piercing it's target to death, or throw A F*CKING SCYTHE AND WATCH AS IT SLICES SOMEONE IN F*CKING HALF. Also, you can pour gasoline all over everything and then just light it with a match and watch it burn, or... you can get an air freshener and combine it with a lighter to make a F*CKING FLAMETHROWER AND BURN THE LIVING SH*T OUT OF EVERYTHING. And, you can pour gasoline all over cars to watch them explode, or pour it all over every car and trigger a C-C-CHAIN REACTION and watch as they kill cops around them.(C-C-Combo). And the most fun thing... when you go further into the map and then come back... everyone is once again alive, which means you can kill them again, and again, and again, and again, till it gets boring and you want to go to an another location.

I played many violence games before, but postal 2 is kinda different (i think).  You playing as Postal Dude, an 'ordinary guy' (with an extraordinary sense of dark humour) with 'ordinary' things to do (to-do list or mission or whatever you call it). You can free roam around town with most of the building can be entered legally or illegally. Some building has a nasty stuff and nasty secret inside.  in some cases, there is more than 1 way to complete the task (i recommend to save the game before you decide to to something big). For example when the postal dude has to buy milk at the grocery store (Lucky Ganesh).   Option 1; (ordinary dude way) take the milk, get in line and pay 5 buck for the milk. Option 2; (shoplifter dude way) take the milk, and run like hell. Option 3; (postal dude way) take the milk, flush everyone with gasoline, light the matches and watch them burned.  Pros; + Kinda free roam. +The Postal Dude is funny (in dark humour way). + Plenty things to do (good or bad? up to you). + you can pee anywhere, anytime or even get choked by your own pee. Salty. + Lots of weapons and items. (just seach for it and you will find it). + Lots of people and animals that you can interact (you know what I mean?). + You can buy stuff with money (optional)  Cons; - The game could become boring fast after long time of playing. - The game graphics is not as good as Hatred. (Postal 2 (2003) / Hatred (Q2 2015))  Conclusion; =JUST BUY THE GAME! (especially when it's 90% off on Steam).  Note; $ Will also review Postal and Postal III (if it's 90% off on Steam).",

            "review_text": "Well, I suppose I should start by saying that I've seen Uwe Boll's film Postal several times, and when I saw this game on sale I just had to get it. After about a month of half-hearted attempts to download it (The game is only 3 gigs, but I have limited free time and rubbish internet) I finally finished the download and decided to try it. I immediately noticed a distinct lack of subtitle options, which did not bode well as I do not live alone and correctly assumed the game would have a considerable amount of profanity. However, there have been no issues yet with the language situation. I will mention that the controls aren't always what they are supposed to be, which has caused a fair bit of confusion.  Beyond that, this game is clearly dated graphically however this does not bother me. I've never really cared about the graphics in games. The violence, while extreme for it's time is fairly unrealistic and often comical. Clearly, this isn't a game for children but parents of teenagers should not be concerned about their offspring's mental health with this game. Furthermore, it's only as violent as you want it to be. While you may have to defend yourself in certain scenarios it is entirely possible to finish the game without firing a shot in anger (or so I'm told, I only made it to Wednesday before going nuts). In fact, a good part of the fun for me was trying to stay peaceful in a crazy world. Now, I've only made it to Thursday's first task so I don't know how insane it gets but it's been rather enjoyable so far.  Every single review mentions the cat silencer (but neglects to state that it's only for your shotgun) and your ability to urinate on people at will. I was also fond of the ability to show my character's genitals to random women, that was a safe way to unleash one's inner flasher. There are also 'health pipes' to smoke and plenty of fast food to eat.  So, in conclusion it's a cheap bit of fun for those who don't take life too seriously. Or fans of Uwe Boll, as his film Postal is absolutely bonkers and not too far off from the stuff in this game.  (Edit: Meant to change this ages ago. The cat silencer can be used on the assault rifle, but as it fires so quickly it's useless.)",

But any case in this town can turn into a fierce - the people here are extremely crazy in the head, unpleasant and rude. That's why our Man Neilson will freak out because of what he has to take up arms and make a fierce bloody gebnya on the streets of this ♥♥♥♥ing town. On his way to face Islamic terrorists, strikers (opponents RWS, books), psychotic butchers, homosexuals, and other animals! The most interesting is that the game, almost no murders, but who is'nt??? Is that just go on this way most uporotyh in the Board pacifists! In contrast to the recently-released Hatred, this game does not pretend to gloom and seriousness. His world is reminiscent of the idiocy rather South Park than our reality!  Postal 2 is probably the real madness in the mad city, which is to be treated sometimes, do not want!!!  Violent elephants 9 out of 10  (Русский) Postal 2-это скандальная и провокационна игра, которая создавалась вероятно для того, чтобы устроить нехилую боль в заднем дворе у моралфагов.  Действие игры происходит в американском городке Парадиз. Главный герой, которого зовут просто чувак, живёт со своей ̶К̶р̶а̶с̶а̶в̶и̶ц̶е̶й̶ жирухой женой в фургоне, работает разработчиком видеоигр и решает бытовые проблемы. Оплатить счета, купить молочка, не вылететь 'пинком под зад' с работы-в общем все по мелочи. Вот только любой случай в этом городке может превратиться в лютый апокалипсис - люди здесь живут на редкость поехавшие на голову, неприятные и грубые. Вот поэтому наш Чувак неилюзорно психанет, из-за чего ему и приходится браться за оружие и устраивать лютую кровавую гебню на улицах этого придурошного городка. На его пути встанут исламские террористы, забастовщики (противники RWS, книг), психопаты-мясники, гомосексуалисты и прочие животные! Самое интересное что игру пройти, почти без убийств, но кому это нахрен надо??? Разве что только пойдут по этому пути самые упоротые в доску пацифисты! В отличие от того же недавно вышедшего Hatred, данная игра не претендует на мрачность и серьезность. Его мир напоминает по идиотизму скорее South Park, нежели нашу реальность!  Postal 2-это пожалуй, самое настоящее безумие в безумном городе, от которого лечиться иногда, совсем не хочется!!!  9 буйных слонов из 10",

Basically you try to go through your day (each level is a day, the whole game is a week) without going insane. You'll be standing in line at the bank to get your paycheck cashed, when some guy cuts you in line. You cut him back and everyone starts to yell at you and call you names. The teller refuses to serve you. In response you pull out a can of kerosene, douse the teller, throw a match on her, watch her run around screaming until she collapses, crawling on the ground. You then unzip your pants and proceed to urinate all over her, before equipping your trusty shovel and chopping her head off. If you are easily offended, this game is not for you. Also, Running With Scissors has mentioned making a TRUE Postal sequel (Postal 3 was made by a Russian company, and it isn't fun), and buying Postal 2 on Steam helps them get the money to do so. So please buy it! Overall, the graphics are poor for today's standards, the gameplay is fun (but the gunplay feels dated), the story is WHO CARES, and the game is easy to run on any computer. 7.5 / 10",

            "review_text": "Postal 2, years after its original release, is still one of my favorite games. I should explain that at the time it came out, my sophomoric potty-mouthed sense of humor had more to do with me enjoying the game than anything else. The long load screens, the buggyness, the getting stuck in certain places all the time; these did little to hinder my enjoyment of running around and peeing in peoples faces while I kicked them.   Seriously, who couldn't find that funny? Anyway, Vince Desi has made several points about the game and there's a reason it has such a huge cult following. I did eventually play the game in a challenging mode and it was, indeed, rather hard. You could play the game from beginning to end without killing a single person, and the fact that there were cheat codes built in to it were what made it fun. There, I said it. This is one of those games where the cheat codes can make a game incredibly fun, not necessarily to help you complete the game in a 'fair' manner, but to see everything that the game can do.   My sophomoric sense of humor came rushing back the minute I re-purchased (being the second copy I've owned, only this time with all the expansions) and started playing the game again. I had forgotten about some of the over-the-top action that the game provided.   That being said, I don't want anyone to think that I don't realize the glaring issues with the game. It wasn't necessarily the prettiest game, but it has aged well in comparison to some others. The voice acting in parts was terrible, probably on purpose, and the situations are ludicrous. Not that this is necessarily a bad thing, and again, this could've all been done on purpose. My biggest issue is with all the friggin' loading screens. Even with those, it doesn't take away from what the whole point of this game and this series is about: you can be the good guy or the bad guy. You can be innocent in the face of corrupt police, jerkwad store owners, and generally stupid street people that think they're 'cool' - and live out your life in relative obscurity - or you can be the alpha-jerk who pees all over the place and kills people with a shovel. Or a shotgun. You know, whatever.  I would absolutely recommend this game, RWS deserves support and praise if not for just keeping the spirit of free speech alive. Now go and buy the game, go to the RWS website and buy the merchandise, and have a damn good time while you do it. Oh, and skip over Postal III until RWS decides to do a sequal their way.   7.5/10  Note that my score is based in relation to my personal feelings on the game, I love it! I would give it more if not for the constant load screens and crashes that are suffered every couple of hours, which causes you to save your game over and over again.   Any points taken away are not for the vulgarity, the hilarity, or the overall unrealistic silliness of the game. Ignoring the problems which is easy to do because I LOVE this game, I personally give it top-10 status in my list of favorite video games of all time. It just came about at the right time in my life, and has continued to be a part of it. A small part of my personal history, and I love it for that. Being offensive for the hell of it is not at all something that is lost on me. Bananas, completely bananas.",

The game is bad ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥ and truly one of the most legendary guilty pleasure video games of all time.  The lack of recommendation though comes from being a linux user and has nothing to do with the actual game.  The problem is RWS has been promising for almost two full years now that steam workshop integration, updates, and achievements would be coming to the linux version, and none of these things have materialized. It's sad that a company that outwardly touts their linux support and how committed they are to their linux fanbase can't even get some basic hooks implemented to unlock steam achievements. Time and time again linux has been ignored by RWS with the promise that 'soon' everything will be different and it never has been. The linux port is functional but it has bugs here or there which will probably never be patched, and it's just sad to see a company that was dedicated to linux when NOBODY else in the gaming world was, eventually end up treating a big chunk of its core fanbase like trash. For that, I do not recommend it.",

Even in a game which doesn't focus on story, that's not a good thing. - The 'humour' in the game isn't clever, instead adopting a more South Park style of shock comedy and raw vulgarity.  Overall, it feels like the video game equivalent of a poorly written episode of South Park, and is something I just want to forget. If possible, I am going to attempt to get my money back for this, but this may be difficult since I put five hours into the game hoping it would get good at some point. It never did. While I can see why someone might enjoy this game, I did not, and I do not recommend this game to anyone looking for a halfway decent gaming experience. I might recommend it to someone looking for pointless and poorly rendered violence and vulgarity. I paid 69p for this, and still feel a little ripped off.",

A shamelessly awful game, and a controversial one from back in the day when Saddam Hussein, Osama Bin Laden, and Gary Coleman were still alive, and Jack Thompson wasn't barred from law. There is basically no plot to this game; you are just some schmuck living in a trailer park (read: behind a house) with who I thought was his mom at first, is actually his wife, and every day of the week, you're sent out to run some errands in a town filled with people seconds away from losing their minds (and who can blame them!?). Naturally, your daily errands become a slog through hell as one catastrophe stacks on another, and the end of the week ends with the apocalypse and an attempted suicide. I am referring to the Postal Dude, not myself.  The humor in this is as low as the brow gets, trying to be as offensively bad as possible with a particular obsession with Joe Liebermann and Gary Coleman. Even the kid who laughs at every fart jokes will be turned off by this. The best the humor gets is when you're running through the park, trying to find a Christmas tree, and after rejecting every tree for one reason or another all the way to the end, the perfect tree is highlighted by a god ray, cue the choir of angels. It was hardly worth the price of admission.  On top of the awfulness of the game itself, this is also a badly optimized port (though I do not blame the people who worked to add this on Steam). However, unlike most poorly optimized ports, this one will run about as fast as your computer can manage, and there is no way to tell the game to ease up on the throttle. This bleeds into cutscenes where characters will vomit out all their lines right at the very beginning before the animation can catch up. When it comes to the controls, it feels like you're trying to control a rocket-powered zamboni. You never feel truly in control, and will zoom about the map like a Benny Hill chase montage gone horribly wrong. The only way to get the game to slow down is to use a program to force your computer to operate with essentially one hand tied behind its back, but it's an unacceptable solution. For those of you who aren't experienced with overclocking, proceed at your own risk.  It's a bit cliche for the title, but this is obviously one of the games to steer clear of. Not just because of the substance, but because of the style. It fails to impress in both, it was made that way, but just because that was the intention doesn't mean it's good. Don't even send this as a prank to a friend. It will send all the wrong messages about yourself.  Just no.",

            "review_text": "Recently I've been aggressively critical toward Goat Simulator for being 'too satirical' of Simulator games, and I still stick to that. While that opinion may seem to conflict with the one I'm about to give, I have my reasoning for everything and if I were asked about it, I would give answers.  I think this is an interesting game. I think that this is a pretty funny and satirical game and I am able to appreciate it. I bought it on sale for 99 cents so I can definitely say that it was worth the price.   As far as the content is concerned, it seems pretty straightforward, but there is a lot that you can do. I've played it for nearly two hours and I don't think that I've scathed the surface with what you're actually able to do in the game, so this review is having only played it for a short while.  I would suggest this to anyone who enjoys satirical games and I would even venture to say politics, because this does have a lot of political humor and definitely darker humor about things in our society.   Check out gameplay videos and all that before you buy it. Enjoy it.",

            "review_text": "postal 2 is a gam similar to the games you would play on newgrounds in the summer of 2004 except instead of being a mindless murder/torture similatro, it gives players a very odd array of unconventional weaponry and lets them explore a world of unlikable characters with targets literally painted on their backs. what happesn enxt can only be described as every soccer mom's worst nightmare come t o life.   postal 2 is developed by RWS, devleopers whose original claim to fame was children's games, before a title dropped in 1997 known only as 'postal', an isometric shooter wiht the goal 'kill everybody'. as you can imagine, the game went over as well as any game who gives the player the objective to kill elementary school children. postal 2 is a departure from the disturbing, psychotic, low-budget slaughterfest of postal 1 but it still managed to attract enough, if not more controversy than the original.   the player assumes the role of the postal dude (his real name) as he goes abotu his day completing menial tasks such as returning library books or picking up a carton of milk. however, the game's tagline 'it's only as violent as you are' is a bit misleading as mosto f these 'menial tasks' eventually devolve into hectic shootouts usually over small or unnecessary reasons. itsn early impossible to complete the gaem without killing anybodybecaus the game usually forces you into very heated firefights with no real means of getting around hostile individuals.   still, if anything can be taken from this, you can draw a parallel between the hyperviolent world of postal 2 and the average ocnsumer in a world where violence seems normal and portrayed as regular or necesssary. maybe as a means of trying to compare the npcs inhabiting paradise as amrericans or trather caricatures of americans who feel the need to attack or ruin anything they find violent, by using violence. from a rhetoric standpoint, postal 2 is very deserving of analysis and a very srong contender for the 'ivdeo games as art' argument.   that might seem silly from a game that allows you to attach cats to weapons as silencers or set people on fire and watch them burn to death while you ♥♥♥♥ on them and dismember each of their limbs one by one. however, this migth bring about an even better discussion topic: when is killing ever humane? in war? postal 2's streets are battleifelds and everybody is out to get you. does it matter whether you use an assualt rifle or a scythe? when is killing justified?   postal 2 is very dreary with the world caught in a perpetual limbo of sunset and denizens who ecxist only to make your life a tiny bit harder. unlike its predecessor, postal 2 is an fps game. for 2003, the graphics are low quality but passable. there are tiny details included taht cement the sequel as polished (at least in compariosn to the first). music barely exists, save for nightclubs, store bgm, and general ambience. the arsenal is varied enough to surprise traditional fps fans and win over the hearts of oldschool fps fanatics.   is psotal 2 disgusting? yes. is postal 2 offensive? of course. is postal 2 distasteful? absolutely. is postal 2 a good game? yes.   8/8 its pretty great.",

It's as if again, a teenager, was put in a room and told to write something that would upset people. Unfortunately all of their attempts fell flat, at most getting a small 'heh' out of me for their effort at making a joke. I wasn't offended, I was annoyed with crap gameplay and repetitive scenarios.   Each day of the week you're given three tasks to complete. Usually something goes wrong and you're forced to use force to escape, or it's just easier to blast your way through than to do it the 'nice' way. I suppose if you want to you can kill random people by a number of ways and then ♥♥♥♥ on their corpses afterwards. I'll give Postal 2 credit for being unique, but after seeing these gimmicks one time, they're boring.  I only made it halfway through Thursday (game goes till Friday and has a weekend for the new DLC) when I decided I couldn't take the terrible gunplay and boring walking from place to place anymore. Engaging people in the streets was a waste of ammo and time. In games like GTA5 or saints row, I would hear someone say something, beat them up, or shoot them feeling a little satisfied. Then get chased by the cops. In this game I shoot a guy on the streets, then I shoot the cop right after and it ends. Nothing exciting or interesting about it (no risk or reward not even the satisfaction of 'beating' the cops).  Overall: terrible comedic writing, terrible (repetitive) gameplay, and the game wasn't even offensive (even though that's what everyone remembers it for).",

Workshop support will also extend the life of the game, thus making it an excellent buy. All in all, it's a great game, but I found one flaw, this happens especially on the Apocalypse Weekend levels: The game drops FPS like it's nobody's business. Most of the time it stays way over 60 fps, but in one of the missions, it dipped so badly that the mission was unplayable without a cheat code. I'm talking FPS dips to below 3 FPS. Hopefully you can sort that out, but other than that, this game is definitely worth a play.",

Gun play and general gameplay that would make even the insane cry. Doesn't make a lot of sense. No real plot or targets to do. All of these make it a very strangely satisfying and refreshing game.

Definitely not a game for kids, the easily offended, or someone who doesn't laugh at bad taste, toilet humour, and gay culture. With that out of the way, Postal 2 lets you indulge in cartharsis in a way that no other game dares. On one hand it is a parody of modern day gun-toting America, on the other, a right-wing nut-job's shooting gallery, on another hand entirely, it's a test of Christian faith!  There is no plot to the game other than to do your daily chores, but the other citizens in the game have other ideas. Usually violent ones. One of the best things about this game is that while you are prodded and enticed to commit violent actions - it is never mandatory. In most scenes in the game, you can play like Ghandi and respond non-violently by running away to escape assailants and at the end of the game you are rewarded for the accomplishment. Of course with all those guns lying around, it would be a bit silly to let all that ammo and flammables go to waste.... You can dish out virtual ultra-violence on all your bigoted hatreds in one game! Just about all targets of right-wing extremist hatred are present.  Gameplay resembles grand-theft-auto, but without the ability to drive vehicles. There's plenty of variety in scenes the player is put in (the compound stand-off was genius), and the adult humour is funny the first time around at least. What's most enjoyable is watching the in-game characters fight amongst themselves. You can hit a character and run away, and they will blame someone else, and watch them get into a gunfight, which the police try to break up but also get involved in. Once enough stray bullets have flown around, more people get in on the action and so on, and so on, until it's total and utter chaos.  The grpahics are old and fairly poor, but it's probably just as well.",

Though obviously not intended for normal everyday gamers, especially not the easily offended by extreme violence, language, etc. But if you're bored of the middle of the road average games being highlighted by the public and you're craving for demented madness, you should definitely play this game.

I will admit, however, that I had a boatload of fun doing said heinous things in the game itself.  Because games exist for you to act out horrific things in a fantasy world with no real consequences. If I want to blow off Gary Coleman's head with a shotgun and ♥♥♥♥ into the bloody hole where his neck used to be, then goddammit I will!  If I want to play fetch with my loyal canine using the burnt, severed head of a terrorist that I just tasered into flames mere moments prior, I don't see the problem with that.  If I want to slaughter cannibalistic butcher shop workers with a pistol silenced by a cat's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, that's pretty much my right as a person.

            "review_text": "Postal 2 was my first ever open world(ish) game. I've played this since its release in 2003 so 99% of my hours are not logged here.  Postal is a FPS where you can be as peace loving as a hippy or as homicidal as a maniac.  You are the Postal Dude and its up to you to complete your many daily tasks. Buy milk, collect a Christmas tree, you even get Gary Coleman's autograph. What could go wrong? You start the day with the tasks marked out on the map. You can explore (robbing houses as you go if you wish) and perform your tasks in any order. The world is persistent and people go about their business without interaction from the Dude. The levels are the days of the week and on Monday you start with a lot of 'Paradise' blocked off to you. As the days progress the game opens up more and more. You can choose to play the game from Monday to Friday (the weekend came later as a thing known as an 'expansion pack' :) ) or you can play the entire week. Saturday and Sunday forego all the open world aspects in favour of linier gameplay and the events are crazy even by Postal standards.   You do have a choice of how to act but the game pushes you towards violence in an obvious fashion what with rude passers by, weapons laying around (I know this is set in America but bloody hell) and the fact that a pacifists game is a boring one. There are a huge amount of weapons ranging from petrol and match to a scythe. A lot of fun can be had killing the populous. Some will run screaming in terror, others will shoot at you and if the police catch the carnage then they will try to arrest you. Now you have choices. Run, hide and hope the police bar runs out and disappears so they stop looking for you? Bribe the officer and hope it works? Or you could take the go quietly route. You'll be taken to a cell and will have to escape. If you fail to escape (and are not horribly beaten to death) you'll be taken to another cell a higher floor up that's tougher to get out of.  As you perform tasks you'll end up getting on the wrong side of certain groups. It’s always a case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time and is really not fair on the Dude. Members of these groups will try to kill you on sight from that point on. 'Go on! Be violent! Its only defending yourself!' says the game. Another way Postal 2 steers you on the path to the dark side.  So that's it. Complete tasks to end your day and you can kill as little or as much as you like while doing it. Simple but a lot of fun. If you're one of the more shallow gamers and graphics are all you care for then don't touch this game. Postal 2 has an even more dated look than other games of its era. This is being improved slightly by the devs supporting the game (11 years later!) and updating the graphics here and there. There are many crude and hilarious moments. Nothing is to be taken seriously here but it’s the kind of humor the easily offended should stay away from. Being able to urinate on people in the context of the game is funny but it’s not for everyone. There's a ton of funny events, tasks and things you can see around Paradise and I don't want to spoil it for anyone new.  As a final note the achievements for this game are the best ever on Steam. Most of them are loads of fun to get! How about that for a novel concept? Other devs take note!",

The objective: Do what your wife tells you to do within 1 week (Yes, the full seven days) but how YOU wanna do it. To understand what I mean by this, here is what happened when I first played: The wife wanted me to pick up so milk and collect and cash a check...I killed over 50 people, creamated 50 more, kicked some people to death, beat others with a shovel, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ on 3 cops, shoved a shotgun up a cat's butt and shot the poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ across a building, fought a store clerk after trying to steal some milk which lead to him pulling out an nearly killing me with an M16, AND THEN I picked up and cashed the check...then did pretty much everything I just listed above on the way home...Yea this game is ♥♥♥♥ed up at best...but in a fun way. You can play the game the way you want. Yes, you don't have to kill at all, you can live life normally and not do anything wrong...but this is almost a test of will-power since the game pretty much ENCOURAGES you to kill and do horribly funny ♥♥♥♥. Seriously, I mean when you first start the game, you find a shovel, some armor, matches, and a freaking gas tank! How could you NOT kill anybody :3?  This game does have a lot of insensitive content so buy at your risk if you get easily offending by racial stereotypes and idea's such as a freaking Homeless simulator for kids. Also, this game seems to make fun of violence in video games. It feels like the game is saying 'Screw all you people who hate violence in video games' and I....am completely okay with this. Seriously, this game is just awesome in every way for me and I love it! Honestly, this game is for those people who wanna just pull off some stress from school, work, maybe family? This is a great way to control stress for you, just go crazy and go kill people without risking you going to jail in real life and getting the death penalty. I just pray that none of you actually do this stuff in real life because trust me, if you ♥♥♥♥ on a cop, he or she is not just gonna stand there and look at you digusted and throw up...no buddy your going to jail for real so don't be an idiot and try to recreate what you see in this game for the 'Lolz'.  Now if you played the much more disturbing but not as gruesome Postal I, then you will see that this game and the first are VERY different though I still find Postal I an amazing game as well. Postal II is a dark comedy game that seems to make fun of everything while Postal I is just dark, creepy, and twisted. Here are just a little objective comparison: Postal I has you brutally murdering everybody because you have been evicted from your horrible home...that's it, there is no happy joking or funny moments...it's just dark and brutal while Postal II is the opposite in everyway except for violence (Yes, the Postal I and II story lines are completely different and not related in anyway). This game has homophobia, drugs, sex, trans, minorities who abuse their label, and ♥♥♥♥ing Gary Coleman...o and about a thousand other weird things. This game is just stupid, so freaking stupid, and that is the best part about this game. It doesn't take itself seriously like Postal I. Postal II pretty much says 'O, you killed a bunch of people and possibly ruined the lives of all their families and loved ones? Well good news! Homeless Simulator has just came to town and people wanna play it, YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO :D!'   So pick up Postal II today, seriously, you have nothing to lose. O, and multiplayer is fun, good ol' DM and the achievements are halirious and insensitive at best! O and since this is the Complete Collection, the expansion packs are included and they are fun as hell and just adds more ♥♥♥♥ for you to do. Sooooo, go Postal and start wrecking havoc! Or, if you are just Good Guy Greg, don't kill anybody and wreck ♥♥♥♥ up, just do what your wife says and go home just to have her nag at you the next day to do her differnet errands...you'll see how long you can last the week in this game before you end up going Postal....Ooo is that a shotgun over there?",

Postal 2 essentially hands you a small town called Paradise, fully realized. I never encountered a door I couldn't go through. The game gives you menial, everyday tasks to do; buy milk, return overdue library book, pay parking ticket. One genius guy from RWS said 'The game is only as violent as you are.' Which is true. You can go through the whole thing without killing anyone. But where's the fun in that? Anyway, this is a solid 9/10 for sheer shock value and total enjoyment.

Exclusive to Steam version: - even though the game has 11 years it's still updated, - Steam Workshop, - achievements, - new options (like accesories for pedestrians or antialiasing), - two new difficulty levels, - new easter eggs (like Postal III on the junkyard :P), - Postal 2 merged with Apocalypse Weekend (just like in A Week in Paradise mod) - new weapons from Apocalypse Weekend are available in Postal 2.  Cons: - poor soundtrack, - poor cutscenes, - it takes too long to find a specific weapon if you have full inventory what often results in death, - Apocalypse Weekend is very linear, - Taliban training camp and military base in Apocalypse Weekend are way too long and boring, - there aren't any languages different than English in Steam version (it's easy to copy translated files from boxed version but first you need to buy boxed version).  I have a lot of fun with this game. I give 9/10 for Postal 2 and 7.5/10 for Apocalypse Weekend. :)",

You move with WASD, look with the Mouse, and use various buttons for other commands. Some weapons have an alternate fire, such as throwing scissors or using both barrels of a shotgun, some items require you to aim when thrown, and so on. Standard FPS controls in every regard.  Music is lacking. Greatly. About the only memorable music I can remember is the music heard in the grocery store, which sounds like it's from a parody of Middle-East culture. Of course, that's the whole point, but it's pretty weak in that it's not even that good. Granted, the music would be drowned out by the ambiance and dialogue, but still.  Gameplay is exceptionally fun. You can literally do nothing, or you can go Postal and kill everyone in a variety of ways. One of the more notable and entertaining 'weapons' is your own ♥♥♥♥♥; you unzip your pants, whip it out, and urinate. You can pee all over things, on people's faces, on cats and dogs, and even on a doughnut that a cop is about to eat. Why is this so funny? Because it's disgusting and nasty, and that's absolutely hilarious. There's few points where you can do something other than what's intended, such as running away with milk rather than paying, sending a dog after a cop by letting the cop hit you, killing Gary Coleman and taking his autograph, and my personal favorite; killing everyone at the junkyard and running for dear life from all the angry rednecks and dogs. Insane or Sane, you can play however you like and always get the same ending.  Storyline is slim but enjoyable; you are the Dude, going about your daily life for one week. Collect milk, call your wife a ♥♥♥♥♥, set cars on fire, ♥♥♥♥ on cats, and so on. You know, stuff you do on your normal daily life. It's nothing too grand, nor is it lacking; it's an ordinary man's ordinary day, and nothing more or less.  Unless you're a radical feminist, this game is mindlessly fun. Just let loose in a virtual alternate world, and enjoy yourself. Be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or be a pacifist, be a hero or be a crook. Be the man who waits in line, or be the man who clears a line with a shotgun. You are in control.",

If you like 80's humor, and old and probably offensive jokes that may still apply today, not including the weird advertisements and businsness names everywhere. Ever want to ♥♥♥♥ on someone? Go ahead, no one is stopping you. A cop wanting to book you? Slice him in half with your trusty Scythe. Its great fun and has really funny jokes involved too. Every having a bad day? Well just go ahead and play some of this. The game clearly states that this game is only for entertainment purposes, but it may still be a controversial game, so venture on at your own risk.

You can also just take it by force and go POSTAL.   Difficulties: There are 15 Different ones. On lower ones its pretty similar but the NPC get better weapons the higher it goes. If you put it on POSTAL difficulty it becomes a challengeing shooter, because everyone will attack you when they realize its you.   Weapons: Are wierd, funny and sometimes dont feel like in other shooters. The pistol for example is mostly used for snipeing. The M4 feels really wierd and you often dont really aim. There are also awesome weapons like the sawnoff shotgun, katana, sniperrifle and the infected madcow-head(like a poison gas grenade, rare and powerfull).  Missions: The missions are funny, wierd, politically incorrect or sometimes insane. Most of them sound very easy at first but the game tries the best to make you go postal. You seem to be that guy in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Style: The game is full of bad jokes, dark humor, funny art and references to worldly worries/problems which it makes fun of. If you dont like that style and dont get the jokes or dont want to get them then you will hate the game otherwise its a treasure.  Positive Facts: the game is from 2003 but gets still some updates ( RWS &gt; EA Games) the 'DLC' Paradise Lost is a complete addon that gives you a new week to complete and lots of new content ( RWS &gt; Moneymaking-DLC-Companies) you can complete the game without killing anyone, so if people say its a violent game then its not the game thats violent but the person playing it, right?  If you are easily offended then stay away from this. Other then that have some postaldude quotes: THATS ♥♥♥♥ING AWESOME. MHMMM SMELLS LIKE CHICKEN! I MUST SAY IM PRETTY GOOD AT THIS.

Or using said machete to attempt to cut off limbs of anybody one by one without killing them while making it a slow torture.  A lot of things to do in this game. Depends on how psychotic and creative you can be.  No worries people against violence. You can attempt to make it through passively. I tried but I hated queues. Oh and loading times are reasonable and it is impossible to get stuck.  Gameplay is good for its time but a more informative tutorial might be nice.

I like how the shelves in the shop are literally pictures of shelving in a convenience store, pasted on a mesh. It still has the nostalgic feel that way, with the old unreal engine, but the textures are much better quality in the new Steam port.

You start the day in front of your trailer and must finish the simple tasks on your to-do list. What I really like about this game is that you don't actually have to go postal. You can wait in line to buy that milk carton, or you can run and hide like a coward during a bank robbery. The controls are just like any other FPS, WASD to move, space to jump, and the mouse to aim and shoot. The suicide key makes a comeback, it is also on the other side of the key board so you won't accidentally kill yourself as often. There is also a new addition to things that should be in more games, the zipper button. This allows you to showoff your #blackgift and also urinate on anything you could ever hope for. The comedy in this game isn't really its strong suit, at least for me. They mostly revolve around racial and sexual stereotypes. This isn't a game you should play if you want to be president or something of that nature. If you can find this game on sale for under a dollar, you should pick it up.",

The point of the game is do basic errends and survive the day. The manner in which you accomplish the errend is up to you, and that's what makes this game so great.  For example, You have to get milk, you can pay for the milk and wait in a line, steal the milk, or kill the owner and his wives, catch their bodies on fire and urinate on them... then steal the milk.  One of the charms of the game is that you can be an absolute madman or you can be a complete pacisfist.     also the game has racist jokes and you have to smoke crack to get health boosts... details details  ",

The only thing I don't like in this game is crouch-jumping. But the world isn't built around using it to get to 99% of the places, so whatever.   _____  Long review: The gameplay feels natural, the controls are responsive and you have plenty of guns for various distances between you and your enemies. Also plenty of 'I just wanna mess around' weaponry.   But what I like the most about Postal 2 is the atmosphere. And not the 'kill everyone then ♥♥♥♥ on their corpses' part of it. Sure, it may be fun to test out your arsenal for the first 30 minutes of the game or so, but then you just live out the life of The Dude.  For me, it's just fun to see what mess you can get yourself into. Completely accidentally (well, more like by activating a scripted scene) or on purpose. You just wanted to return a book to the library — now a(nother) group of crazy protestors thinks you are their worst enemy. You were just buying milk and your curiosity made you check out the storage room — oops, the indian taliban (yeah, better not question it) salesguy and his harem now wants you dead. Oh well, where was my shotgun?  Audio is great. There is no ambiance music except for some locations like a nightclub or arcade shop. Instead there are plenty of nature and industrial noises and people talking/killing/exploding, which only improves the feeling of walking around the town in the middle of nowhere. Map music is just awesome. Dude's phrases are great. They fit perfectly and are exactly what you'd expect from this kind of cynical lunatic. There's enough of lines recorded to keep the killing sprees (or just walking around with a petition) interesting.  Now, I should mention sequels. Not counting Postal 3. As far as I know, that 'game' doesn't exist.   Apocalypse Weekend (AW) is great. Two more days of pure mayhem with good humor and alright missions. It's driven by a story, but well paced and has an enjoyable ending. You won't be disappointed.  Paradise Lost is more of Apocalypse Weekend, and, in my opinion, that's bad. As I mentioned with AW, you progress through the story for the sake of progressing through the story. In classic Postal 2 you accomplished the most mundane tasks because you pretty much didn't have anything else to do and it was fun to see what game will throw at you this time. Here you want to see what happens next. But wait, gotta do this errand first! Then another errand, then this errand, then we will let you progress through the plot. Maybe. Everything else in the formula is great, but this one thing ruined it for me so much, I just don't want to finish it.  ",
