Probably one the more realistic ways to feel like your'e involved as a GM of a franchise than anything I've played or seen. 8/10",

Sadly this game does not (yet) deliver the quality one has come to expect from SI.  The game itself has huge potential. but it feels rushed in a whole.  Currently i have 2 MAIN ISSUES with this game.  1) The screen resolution does not support 16:9 only 4:3 for a modern game this is uncceptable as widescreens are the norm. nowadays.  2) very very prone to crashes during the matches. I had to atleast replay each match twice due to crashes of the game. for a game that draws heavily on the FM engine (or so it looks like) this is very unexpected as one should think the engine has already proven his worth in the FM sries.  so currently while this game has huge potential i can not recommend it at this time.",
