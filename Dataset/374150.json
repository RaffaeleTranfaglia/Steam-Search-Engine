    "description": "Concealed Intent is a simultaneous turn-based game of tactical space combat. Players control their ships in a fully 3D world - hunting down their enemies, just as they are being hunted themselves. In Concealed Intent you know your enemies are out there, but not exactly where, or even what they are.",

            "review_text": "Type of game: Stealth based tactics game done right. By this I mean take a tactical rpg add in stealth game elements and remove the rpg elements. I know some other games have tried this by bringing over detection cones used in real time stealth games and it didn't work so well. The developer of this game gets around that and introduces stealth mechanics to a turn based tactical game in a way that is appropriate to the genre.  Paragraph version of review:  Just started playing but I'm already impressed. If you look on the forums the dev gives a nice detailed answer about what type of game the game is, but in short think of a tactical rpg, minus the rpg (i.e. no leveling, farming currency etc) - so just a tactics game, although unused supplies are carried over from one mission to the next. The detection side of it is a nice new idea for a genre that's needed something like that for a long time and adds another layer of depth. Right now my only real concern is that there might not be a lot of content but I'll update this after I have played some more. In any case it's worth a look even if it's just for the mechanics it introduces, particular if on sale and may or may not be worth the price tag dependent upon how much content there is - unfortunately I'm a little worried that if I was to sit down and play it straight through for a weekend that I would have played through everything it has to offer in a day or two but hopefully that's just a false first impression. Also that's really not how I'm inclined to play this game. Missions are more like combat puzzles and are the type of thing I'm inclined to play one or two at a time and then come back to it a few days (or even weeks) later.  List Version of Review:  Pros: +Lots of good mechanics for a tactics game - not only the stealth/detection aspect, but weapon damage degrades with distance instead of relying on hit chances for this (although there are hit chances, but as far as I can tell these aren't based on distance from target aside from how distance from target plays into detection). Pretty much anything you care about that should be related to distance between targets has reasonable nonlinear relations and you have easy access to detailed information on these (in the form of graphs, which actually works really well for this). I really can't praise this enough with respect to its tactical mechanics +Great interface - there is lots of information readily available that you don't have to go digging through menus to find, weapon damage, detection, how visible your ships are etc are not only easy to find but easy to see breakdowns of why they are the way they are. +Runs smoothly, with minimal bugs - my only complain here so far is that if you try to move too close to where an object (ship, asteroid etc) already is rather than just stopping you from moving the path closer it jumps to a seemingly random location on the map. +Easy controls that only take a little bit of getting use to. +Truly 3D tactical combat. +Doesn't rely on hexes, squares etc. movement and distances are actually measured. As much as I enjoy games that do use these and I think it's a reasonable simplification to tile a plane its nice when you run into a game that implements distances in a non-simplified manner and does it well.  Potential Con: -Might not have that much content. -AI might not play that well - hopefully this is just in the first couple of missions and it gets harder. It does look like their is a hard AI setting available in skirmish mode so hopefully this is a non-issue. -Only one difficulty setting.  Overall: As a first impression the game has tons of potential, but I'm worried it's not going to live up to it because of too little content and too easy of an opponent. If it gets a good multiplayer community going though both of those might not be an issue.  Update: It looks like there are a pretty good array of modes for skirmish so that certainly adds a bit to the amount of content. There are 17 solo missions available and if you beat them all on the first go it would probably be reasonable to beat all of them within a day. That said that's assuming that you can beat them all on the first go without a lot of planning and even a few in I'd say the difficulty is reasonable - managable but certaintly not easy to play through quickly unless you already have a good tactic in mind for the mission.  Additional difficulty modes for the story missions would be nice (i.e. harder modes have more/better ships or even better yet the AI plays better).",
