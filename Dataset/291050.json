            "review_text": "There are game genres wherein terrible writing is acceptable. Pure RPGs, which thrive on story at the expense of almost all else, are not among them. While the combat gameplay is passable, the writing is beyond bad, heaping contrivance upon awkward shoe-in on top of nigh-endless obsequeious player-praising that would make an Elder Scrolls writer blush. Everyone is a dramatic charicature of a person, /everyone/. This is not the grand arena, you are not the chosen one, there is no evil empire, and this game most definitely does not smell like incense. Give it a pass at anything even remotely like full purchase price.",

            "review_text": "I tried to like this game I really did. It seems like there is a dynamic skill and character development at your first glance but it quickly wears off as you can save at literally any time during both conversations and battle. This means you cans save for random dice roll percentile skill checks (given like 22% chance of success) and you can bump each party member in 1 skill and since you have your entire huge party available for most tasks you always succed. Talking to your party hurts me physically as most of the other party members (soldiers) in the game have high school kid conversations. I ended up nearly maxxing charisma to only use it two or three times the entire game. The game appears and plays to be a high class flash game from a website not so much a game worth $20.  I am a big fan of games like Planescape Torment, Fallout, Shadowrun and Age of Decadence so story really matters to me, and with a game which has combat in which you can just click through you need meaningful conversations to happen.   The weak dialogue and character interactions really disappoint because the plot was quite interesting albeit extremely short but the immersion is too easily broken with your character stammering and getting embarrassed like a kid about to have sex for the first time all the while everyone praising your magnificent efforts.  Worse part is I'm likely gonna finish the game just so my character can get laid by sexy female character with the last name 'Fox'. Also the females have a permanent blush tone to their face and with the character writing it seems like a dating simulator with RPG combat elements to advance the storyline.  5.5/10 on completion.",

            "review_text": "Having recently finished playing Planet Stronghold (finishing all of the paths and earning the achievements), I thought it was about time I give it my review. ;D  As those who are familiar with this game, Planet Stronghold is a turn-based RPG. Occasionally, I enjoy a good RPG as long as it has a decent storyline which will keep me engaged for hours. As there is a basic summary of what the game is about on the store page, I won't bother to resummarize it. Rather, I'll say what I liked and what I felt could be improved upon.  First, I like that you can choose whether to play as a female or a male. Not all RPGs offer that as a main playable character so this is nice. Also, I like how you can choose among four different classes: soldier, scout, guardian, or psionic (basically, the sci-fi equivalent of a magic user). I had the chance to play all four classes and it was interesting to note each one's strengths and weaknesses. Also, I like how there are a total of 6 romance subplots you can play and how some of them will require certain quests to be done. However, the romance is totally optional so you can play this game without having to complete any romance subplot. In addition, I like how completing certain quests can earn you better weapons or armor and there is a nice variety of both items available.  Now as to weaknesses...First off, I thought that the RPG aspect itself was slow at times. I found myself having to click to quickly get through a battle. Speeding this up would have been a good idea (assuming that's possible, of course). As to the writing itself, I felt that it was decent although some parts felt a little cheesy at times especially with regards to the romantic scenes. If you're looking for more originality, this game doesn't offer much in that area. Personally, I don't mind a little cheesiness as long as it's not overdone. Finally, I found some minor grammar errors despite that the game was proofread. A little further proofreading would certainly help.  Overall, though, I enjoyed it very much and spent a lot of hours on Planet Stronghold so I suppose I thought it was worth it. I'm eager to give Loren a try now and compare the two games when I have the chance. ^^",

            "review_text": "Addictive game, multiple routes, able to back track. Great story, interesting development. Still wish Lafleur was bi. Nonetheless wonderful game, you buy it, you'll be playing it for a bit. Feels great for a Vn with Rpg aspects similiar to science girls, sunrider, and a few other VNs and Rpgs you've seen here. This piece of work goes in quite the depth similiar to Loren the Amazon Princess. Still very great. Rating 9/10. Reason is I just kind of hate the inventory gui. It sets the new guys who haven't played something like this off, no sorting order, has to be manual, also comparison are confusing if they don't know how to identify them. Can't tell you how many times I was looking at a weapon to double check it's stats and my armor too. I didn't want to die out there. Still great game, highly replayable for a few reasons.",

It was cheesy, badly written or translated and had some balance issues.  I know glowing review but aside from all that it was fun and I got through it. As a 30+ year gamer it has become very easy for me to turn away from a game quickly as there are so many hundreds of options to spend my limited free time in. So if you look at the Store Pages pictures and think to yourself 'That looks amusing but cheesy', it is and I recommend it! Again though only on sale, or if you don't care about the money you toss at games.",
