            "review_text": "I'm sure there are several bugs and yes the multiplayer element could use some work...particularly in the dark areas where only player 1 can see. I will admist as well that the start up time and a few stability issues are annoying, but I do like the concept and I would recommend that the person or group who put this game together keep on it. I enjoy it being, at least on the surface, a simple story with lovable characters in a straight forward action/adventure platformer where your goal is simply...defeat the bad guy and save the world. Sometimes that is all a story needs to be and I feel like there are a lot of possibilities here so please, please game maker keep tuning it up and maybe I can finally get my brother and my dad on board with it. I always figures that castlevania and metroid missed some very fun gameplay possibilities by not making decent multiplayer games in the universe and this type of game could show them what they missed. I will continue to load this game up from time to time and see how it progresses in gameplay and as it is updated. Thank you for your work here and I hope you keep getting things sorted out with it so one day all these negative reviews will just be people who basically played a beta rather than reflected the current state of the game. For potential players I say...give it a decent chance before you just discard it as an unfinished or broken game and give it time cause this seems like early days yet.",

            "review_text": "Endica VII The Dream King is a game we all deserved growing up and are now gifted to be able to play now.  Gameplay: Let's start with difficulty. If you are person who grew up playing side scrollers and love a challenge, go for hard. It rewards players with bullet hell and difficult bosses. I have also played a bit of normal through the start, but choosing certain characters will let you breeze on by. With a plethora of characters and distinctions between each, the game has a rich choice of gameplay types. I personally am a rush down type, so Valos and Dash are great for starters. Mages like Emily area amzing as well. The only issue I am having is finding a player 2 to have amage as well. The mechanics are what define this game. A well polished medroidvania for it first hitting the market, with great platforming, enemies, bosses and more. The game also features skills for all characters, making a personal experience for each and giving different play styles and a sense of completionism. I pesonally will go back and grab all the coins I can to unlock more to the game. The fast-paced mechanics and quick reactions make this game a phenomenal blend of what I have always wanted in a side scroller I never really got in Megaman, Castlevania, Metroid, Contra, Metal Slug, Legend of Mana, etc. It blends all the wants and needs of a Metroidvania into one.  Story: I know the story may seem childish compared to games of today, but almost all 16 bit fantasy side scorllers usually had a lighter side to them. A close compariosn to me is Secret of Mana, which one of the original composers helped with the soundtrack for the game as well (Disclaimer: The soundtrack is fantastic and holds true to the backdrop of the story and type of game). I am not far into as I wished to write this review, but reading the dialogue is a quick indication.  In closing, the game is a fantasic piece that should not be overlooked! It offers amazing gameplay, a stunning soundtrack, a nostalgic story and boasts so much more. I would recommend playing the game with a few friends for probably one of the best couch co-ops in the last few years or enjoy playing the solo. Either way, this game is simply awesome.",
