            "review_text": "Yeah Round 4. Battle beginns. This time Hades, Zeus and Hera act together and how should it be, Hercules get a dark twin (Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time Water Temple greets). The game is like before getting resources and some extra fields are no in the game, Hercules can splash gems where foodbushes comes out, the evil hercules comes your peasants in the way and you must take him out fast to lose less time, if thiefs comes you must react fast. So not many change you have 50 levels, 5 puzzles where you need to find most of the puzzle pieces in the 50 levels before, then you get 5 extra levels and a super level at the end and you can try like before to beat the developer records as a test of your strategy and reacting testing with make your routes so effective like possible. Not much changed, but the levels feels still after 3 games before unique and i had my fun, for me its with a little step the best hercules of all 4 at the moment, but some could get bored after 3 games, because the gameplay is mostly the same, the little storie parts are a nice gimmick but nothing more. I give this game for 10 hours of fun and to see how old and slow i get (joke) but because i love all of this tacticaly genre 93 %, for non genre lovers it should be more less points, but because its cheap and you play it from start to end for such a cheap price, its okay, if you hate strategy games, you better go out this way, maybe you test on of the first 3 games before. Thank you for reading and hopefully enjoy.",

Other than that, it's the same gameplay as the rest of the series, with the same mechanics, same music, etc. No wonder they can come out with a new game every few months; they're almost carbon copies.   Oh yeah, the writing/plot is still hilariously rubbish with no hint of actual mythology apart from a few references. At least there is none of the 'trying to rhyme' now so it's just garbage prose and can be written off as such.  5/10, got my 50 cents worth but that's about all.",

            "review_text": "The creators of the 12 Labours of Hercules series are releasing the games faster than I can complete them :) Less than 1 year passed since the first game, and now I'm trying to finish the 4th and the 5th is already in sight. This rapid pace makes you suspicious that we have a 'more of the same' situation here - and yes, while there are slight changes between the episodes, we basically have four near-identical games with almost 200 levels altogether. More of the same is not a sin, of course - if the quality remains stable and the pricing is right, it can be quite attractive. Fortunately, this is the case with 12LoH.  At this point, the game shouldn't need much introduction - if you're unfamiliar with the series, start with the first one, there's a demo and everyting. As a short summary, it's a time management game with appealing audiovisuals, good level design and a decent challenge on the hardest difficulty.  Compared to the first game, there are a few new elements, the most notable being Megara (Hercules' wife) playing an active part (starting from ep3, actually) - since she doesn't introduce strategic variety (ie. you're always best off doing all her tasks early), I don't find much value here. Thieves were also new in ep2 or ep3 (you can guess what they do), and in ep4, sometimes an evil version of Herules appears to scare your servants. Managing thieves does add an additional dimension to the gameplay, while evil H is just an annoyance. The level design quality remains more or less constant. On most levels you need to make sure you balance your resources well, but there are some levels where you can find different solutions - these tend to be the more enjoyable. Difficulty is an interesting question. I do feel that the games get easier as the series progresses, but it's quite possible that I'm so used to the gameplay that I automatically make better choices than in the first game. To counter this a bit, there's a developer record for each level beyond the gold time, but to be honest, I can't believe it's really what it's called - many times, I do better than that on the first try. So in the next installment, some extra difficulty would be nice.  All in all, it's easy to recommend the 12 Labours of Hercules series - buy one, play it through, if not bored yet, buy next, repeat. If bored, stop for a couple of months, and try again. When I think of the term 'quality casual game', 12LoH is definitely one of the first game that springs to mind. ",
