Second: After a server shutdown from the company my game no longer shows my chats or my scratch history. Now I can no longer continue with my single player leaving me trying to figure out how to completely restart and start over.   Third: I can understand why they thought the blurry type would add the the experience - however as time goes by it becomes more of a hindrance. I am not talking type size - its the blurry scan lines that is a major strain to the eyes. I can not speak for everyone but man - it becomes a total distraction that is taking away from the experience.",

            "review_text": "Hackmud is a 90s hacking game based entirely on text-driven interactions.  The tutorial is rather long, though if you memorized or just wrote down some commands you can practically breeze through it. Which you will have to, unless you want to scour the internet for the answers. While sometimes slightly confusing the game still gives you all parts to piece puzzles together yourself.  The scripting is extremely fun, the timer on hacking missions adds to the thrill nicely.   Where the game falls apart for me though, is the second stage when you leave the 'tutorial area' and join the multiplayer. (you still have to permanently be online to play the tutorial though) See, to get GC (the currency used in Hackmud) you have to hack either NPCs or other players. Since hacking other players isn't really an option at that point you're forced to search for the Tier 1 NPCs and hack them to steal their money. While this is all nice and good, about an hour after the nightly NPC reset all of them are already emptied. This means that a new player, fresh out of the tutorial and ready to betray his fellow sentiences, can't even get started unless he either spends countless hours searching for the 3-4 non-emptied NPCs or has to wait for the nightly NPC reset.  While a lot of people would think this to be of little concern, this game is seemingly aimed at adults who can't just stay up all night hoping to get lucky because they have an actual job where they earn actual money.   From what I understand the community now consists mostly of the elite players, who empty all NPCs with their own scripts. (yes, you can write your own scripts) The starter chat 0000 is full of toxic people spamming their scripts to add them to your own autocomplete in vain hopes of having you run them by accident, stealing your money or revealing your loc. (having your loc revealed by a player means they can hack you and basically ♥♥♥♥ you up with no way around it)   The brutal barrier this creates almost always blocks new people from joining. The long tutorial then also means you can't rightly refund your purchase.   It's still a good game, I'll probably keep trying my luck because I'm a ♥♥♥♥ing idiot. Just don't think you'll be the lucky one to suddenly make it big and finish it, becoming some kind of hacking demi-god, like most other hacking games on the market.",

            "review_text": "  Well, let's review it.  Hackmud is a great game in my opinion. It does have some flaws BUT it is as far as I know a One-Man-Project and to create such a game alone is probably quite hard. I do have some experience with Linux + Coding in general, so the start was a bit easier for as it may be for others. E.g. my buddy bought this game for both of us, i do have experience, he doesn't. It is way harder for him to learn or understand some things in this game but he tries to learn and improve himself.  That showed me that this game is not only for people who know some stuff and more, but also for someone who does not give up and tries to learn more and more. It may be way harder but you got to start somewhere.  It's like the Dark Souls of Coding. You have to be careful who you trust and which script you run. (But you can trust dtr, he is a really nice and supportive guy. He even made an email-Account just for this game and you can mail him. Can't really say much about the others but be careful that v doesn't fools you.)  I also read some reviews and 1 negative review was quite interesting. He/She said that you can only write 1 line in your small scratch'book'. Well He/She didn't know that you can write more lines. Just hit STRG+Return/CTRL+Retunr/CMD+Return while you're 'writing' inside of it and boom you have a new line.  I also don't know much about server issues. Since I got the game it runs fluently and i never got a unwanted dc.  But I do have a really big issue: It is veeeery hard to get some GC (Money) once you're out of the prologue. Almost every low-tier NPC is already hacked and henceworth you can't get money to init your system. That way you can't upload any public scripts and more. I put about 4-5 hours into the game just to find some existing NPCs just to get the message that they are already hacked.  All in all it is a solid game, even though it is very hard to get some money. I like it, i will play it for a while and if you're interested in such games and you're not scared to learn and put many hours into a game than this might be something for you. Just be cautious, don't get fooled, try to learn and be patient.",

The online server cant handle the players. I strongly suggest not to buy the game until this is sorted out. (And to be honest thats nothing a single coder will solve in just a few days!)   Maybe theres an interesting game below the surface. I dont know. I cant know.  Hackmud is an online-only game and the dev is currently not capable to provide a working server for his game at launch.  Edit:2: The broken server is a big mistake that should have been solved before release. The server doest work and wasnt properly tested before launch. This was a failure made by the developer. Happens. Shouldnt happen. No offense or blame to Sean here, just stating the facts.  However Ive decided to request a refund because the game is unplayable and was clearly not ready for release. Will it be a cool game when the issues are solved? Maybe. No clue.  Edit1: The dev patched some stuff and the server runs way better now. Still its often too laggy to recognize your commands within the 5-sec allowance until it rejects your input. Not really acceptable.  Also the game completly crashed my PC multiple times (freeze/lockup with hard reset needed). That was solved after the patch yesterday. Today my game crashs my PC again and its 100% reproducable when I try to alt-tab out of the game (worked flawless yesterday). So far nobody else replied this issue. My PC never locked up before and its only with this game.  The dev is actively working on the game but this rocky launch after 2yrs+ development speaks for itself.  In my opinion you better stay away from this for a while until you see a clear notice that the severe issues a solved properly!",

It's incredible simple, has a captivating world and stories that live within it, and gains a lot of milage out of clever player interactions. It has a bit of a learning curve, but no programming experience is necessary, and there's a friendly community if you really do get stuck.  The game's player interactions are designed to encourage and reward cleverness, sneakiness, and political intrigue. If you've ever been interested in seeing what player drama/stories EVE Online is all about, check out this game instead. Everything in hackmud is designed around those ideas.  The single player campaign lasts between 3-5 hours and can be skipped any time with a single command but, similar to Her Story, the overall puzzle involves figuring out what it is. That said, the campaign story is fairly interesting and worth your time. Unlike most 'tutorials,' it's actually pretty dang fun, and could be a short game all its own.  The only current issue with hackmud is that the (single solo) developer for the game is a bit overwhelmed with its popularity and is currently trying to upgrade and stablize the servers, which have occasional timeout errors. Luckily, the dev is making it his top priority, and he develops for this game full time, so it should hopefully be resolved soon.  ",
