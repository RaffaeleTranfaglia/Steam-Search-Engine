            "review_text": "Very fun visual novel with more freedom and options than are standard for the genre and tons of replayability.   In Scheherazade, you play as a brilliant girl archaeologist/explorer from a distinguished family in her first year of college (basically, a young female Indiana Jones). The game will take you to several locations around the world, each with its own set of missions and tasks from which to choose. Each story or side mission will have a series of 'obstacles' to overcome, each of which can usually be tackled using a couple of different approaches, depending on which stats you've been favoring. You raise your stats at various locations around town (unlike most visual novels, which have 3-5 stats, there are probably 30+ stats here), but there's also a twist on this mechanic: in addition to your permanent personal stats, you can also obtain 'inspirations,' which are essentially cards that will give you a one-time boost to certain stats. Inspirations vary in type and quality, so it will be up to you to explore each location for the best combinations!   I really enjoyed the story and characters. Although the plot in certain mission lines can get rather convoluted, it's always a fun ride when Sadie's at the helm. Some scenarios just plain made me smile. :)  Since this is a visual novel at heart, the gameplay consists of reading, making choices in menus and maps, etc. The game takes place over one year of in-game time, and there are so many different quests and branches from which to choose, it's not possible to see everything in one playthrough, even on Easy difficulty. Although there is a charming tutorial, expect to spend your first couple of in-game weeks flailing about and generally failing objectives as you get accustomed to the flow of the game. There are multiple romance-able characters, but even if you choose not to romance a certain character (or any of the characters), full friendship routes are still available, so the characters don't totally disappear from the game like in some visual novels. This means that, while I enjoyed the romance aspect, even if you choose to remain single, you still get a complete gaming experience. I just finished my first playthrough, which took about 19 hours, and I'm looking forward to jumping right into a second to explore some of the content I missed the first time around!   As far as technical things go, the location maps are super impressive, the menus are well-done, and character art is generally good (although the CGs are not always great). The music is lively and era-appropriate; at the beginning of the game, it really impressed me. As the hours wore on, though, it did get rather repetitive, so a few more tracks might've been nice. I noticed that a few lines of dialogue seemed to have the wrong speaker's name on the text box, but this was rare, and the only bug-like thing I encountered (trouble getting achievements to register) was promptly fixed by the developer a couple of days after launch, so everything seems to be very stable.  To summarize, Scheherazade is a fun, extremely meaty visual novel game that oozes atmosphere and charm and even manages to incorporate a considerable degree of strategy in the form of stat-management mechanics. Recommended for fans of VNs and those who want to explore a girl-Indiana Jones-type plot full of adventure!",

            "review_text": "Ok I want to start off with the fact that I am highly intrigued by the storyline as I love Ancient History. I also love that this story is based in the 1930s and it has great artwork that is very different from other visual novels.   I got this game on sale for about $6 and I am glad I did, because although I do love aspects of this game (i.e the artwork, plot, and setting)...it is quite difficult to actually understand how to play. Not only do you have to gain skills but you have to get dream inspirations that I am not really sure what they do. I am going to keep playing although I will be using a walkthrough to see if I can get a better grasp on how this game actually works. I will update my review again once I finish the game.   ***For those wanting to try this game, I recommend buying it now while its on sale***",

While I was hesitant to purchase this game at first due to its price, I whole-heartedly recommend this to anyone who enjoys visual novels, mysteries, and adventures! ",

The romances are also very sweet and I particularly enjoyed how all the individual stories came together in the end. Well, all except one, which was of course the one I chose to with on my first try. The Ahmose path really seems like it doesn't fit with all the others, like it might have been some tacked on DLC. Maybe don't start with that path.",

            "review_text": "I’m finally done with this game, and while it has some issues, I must tell this was one of my most enjoyable gaming experiences lately.  I highly recommend this game, but you should be warned about a couple of things. First of all, this is a very long visual novel styled game. If you don’t like the style, you won’t be able to bear with it, believe me. It also has an awful amount of stat rising that may be really unnerving at times. I tend to hate VNs with stat rising, but believe me or not, I liked it in this game, because it wasn’t all about stats, and the so called “inspirations” you gather are a pretty good idea – you’ll understand if you play. Though, I must admit I’ve played on easy mode, and I wouldn’t try any other – some of the stat checks were really tight even on easy (but well, I’m not very good with stat management). I don’t really think you can have a really middle ground opinion about the game, to be honest – either you love it or you hate it.   What do I love about it? Well as I’ve said, the stat system is quite enjoyable to me. But more than everything, I love the story and the characters. The characters are cheesy and over-the-top, in a good way. I mean, you couldn’t expect a 18 years old girl to speak god knows how many languages, be able to repair vehicles, do magic tricks, use guns, fight thugs… This is impossible in the real life! But it seems so natural in the game. Besides, I really like her – she has that silly crazyness about her. And I like the other characters at least as much as her, if not more. Well, not everyone, of course, but the cast is quite lovable. I like the romance option characters, except maybe for Nigel who isn’t my kind of character. I went for Ahmose’s romance/ destiny in my playthrough – he’s really lovely and I must admit I have a thing for undead romance options, so yeah. But let’s not dwell on that. I genuinely like some of the other characters Sadie can meet, like Rashad or that sly Zul.  Well now, in my opinion the game is all about the story, the characters, the romances… basically, the content. The “packaging” on the other hand may not be so pretty. What I mean is that the art is fine, but nothing more than that, except maybe for the maps for every region – these are actually really neat. The music isn’t exceptional either. Some tunes are pretty, some are annoying, some you don’t even notice. Overall, the music would benefit from some polishing, and I would have enjoyed some more emotion filled tunes at some points of the story.   But overall, the game was so much fun and enjoyment I would recommend it to everyone, as long as they like VNs.   PS: it’s a shame the game doesn’t have a “story mode” without skill checks, so you could replay it fast in order to get other endings, but I see how it would be impossible to make since lots of things depend of the success or failure of the skill checks.",
