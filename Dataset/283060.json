            "review_text": "I have been playing this game for a bit now, and I have to say, I don't know what all the fuss is about. It's a good game, but if you're a 'hardcore' FPS (first-person shooter) player, this is probably just not your cuppa. This game centers mostly around community. No, it is NOT a 'dating SIM', but there are undeniably strong elements in the game that require you to interact with other people. There is no 'world' PvP in two of the three servers, and there is very little emphasis on it overall (aside from guild wars of course) that I have been able to find thus far. That's not to say there is nothing hardcore about this game, but it's not WoW or LoL. If you're looking for a good game to relax with that you will try to get into the community on, where the majority of the cash shop items are cosmetic and you can't just buy top tier armor on your first day in the game from it, then you might want to consider Lucent Heart. I hope to see yall in game, and if you do decide to join us, come dance with us in Thereall whenever you need a break from the grind. ^.~",

The reason i got Lucent Heart was to find something i could play with friends. I even made more friends through Lucent Heart! I love how its linked to our Zodiac signs too!! It is so cool using Dance Show to dance and that you can have people dance along with you. I also love that you can team up with other players to help you with quests and talk to cupid to find your soulmate. People think this game is terrible or bad but they just haven't even tried, yes i agree with some comments saying it is laggy but the comments like how girls play guy characters and guys play girl characteers. I am a girl playing a girl character... but anyway i would recommend this. My character is DeathToTheStars and i hope to see you around&lt;3",

The game seemed fun at first, I tried to make some friends to quest with and I'm welcomed with complete silence since everyone banded together, called me an 'attention-seeking troll' and 'blacklisted' me. In conclusion, the game is okay, with dated graphics, and an overly sensetive weeaboo community.  10/10 would get ♥♥♥♥ on again.",

Don't get me wrong, graphics have nothing to do with making a good game so I don't care about that.",
