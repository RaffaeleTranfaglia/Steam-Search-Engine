            "review_text": "Highly underrated game. Its acrobatic platforming is smoother, better balanced and with a greater sense of flow and action than all of the previous games. It may not have the same charm and the rich story and character interactions of Sands of Time, but for my money its gameplay alone makes it one of the best of the franchise. I suspect the reason people were so critical of this game was simply because it was released as a tie-in to the disappointing movie.",

            "review_text": "To all the naysayers: This game does not deserve it's 'mixed' rating. It's a great game and it's even a good PoP game. I literally can't find much fault here. The game is unpatched (v 1.00) yet I've encountered not a single bug. The prince moves and fights smoothly and responds well to commands. I've only encountered a handful of times in which I wanted to do something that he did not (usually that's wall jump instead of wall run or vice versa, which has always been a problem). There's everything here that makes an interesting game: good platforming, interesting mechanics, devious traps and relatively diverse combat, though this is still the weakest part of the game (but thankfully after having played Sands of Time right before this one it's nowhere near as bad and actually quite enjoyable). People complain that there is no block button...you don't need it in this game. Simple as that.  The platforming is extremely smooth and there are enough mechanics introduced throughout the game (about 8 hours in total) that it won't get boring. You have a few boss fights, mini bosses, etc. The story is actually rather interesting as well, though here is my one and only real gripe with the game...it's a pre-sequel. It's PoP 1.5 instead of PoP 4 for example or just an entirely new game. It interjects the overall story arch with something that wasn't necessary in my opinion and since it's about 8-13 years newer than the rest of the games it takes you out of the immersion (it's weird going from 2003 to 2010 and then back to 2004 and 2005). Apart from that I can only recommend this one. It looks good, plays seemlessly and has an interesting story.",

I'll list down the things that make this game fun to play as well as the things that make this game annoying to play.  Pros of the game:  -Its a Prince of Persia game. -Simple combat system! -Powers! -Swords! -The Prince's Facial Hair! -Platforming with traps! -Hilarous Ragdolling! -Swordplay! -Kill Cam! (well..yeah, sort of kill cam) -Art style and art direction! -Voice acting! -Graphics! -Ambient sounds! -Environment Puzzles! -Skills and or powers and such! -Ezio Auditore Da Firenze Skin! -Getting stuck in the traps! -Rewind ability! -The Prince's Facial hair! -Persian prince that in no way sounds persian! -Some Alternate Outfits! -An Arena Mode! -It has a story! -SAND!  Cons:   -Controls get stuck and most times it is awkward as hell. -No block mechanism. -No targeting mechanism. -Platforming on some parts are laughably easy and some are frustratingly hard (Mostly cause of the awkward controls) -Animations could have been smoother. -Predictable Enemy Boss/Mini-bosses -Not much diversity when it comes to enemies. -Some of the powers are useless and some are OP -Prince does not get up fast enough when ragdolled. -Difficult camera angles + the awkward controls make for artificial difficulty. -Short story on the main campaign. -Ending was lackluster. -Somehow it feels like a blatant sequel-bait game. -Story itself was lacking depth. -Cheap ♥♥♥ FINAL BOSS. -The arena extends play time but i'd prefer if there were missions or a separate campaign with Malik instead (with his half of the amulet at least..oops. spoiler) -The water power could be utilized for other things other than making climbable objects but it wasn't utilized that way. -You'll only ever need the Whirlwind and Ice Blast power. The other two are obsolete and are just there as stat fodder. -You don't get to wear Malik's mask if you have the Malik skin.   I give it a 6.5/10 Cause its a good game which could have been great if there were more to it than just this. Pick it up on a sale cause you won't regret it if you get for less. Cheers",

The graphics are very good (for its time) and the entire game looks outstanding. The sound is great and the controls are smooth and solid and very intuitive. The gameplay is smooth and the game engine runs flawlessly. Combat is a lot of fun, especially once you learn new skills. The levels are expertly designed and there are some pretty challenging platforming stages. The game is so much fun to play because it just looks so awesome. I really love the artwork. Overall this is well worth it when you can catch it on sale, and is even a good buy at its normal price. The only downside I've found so far is that the game exe crashes when you exit, which doesn't even matter as long as it is on exit. Doesn't make sense but oh well it doesn't affect anything. Also when you are playing if you bring up the steam overlay then go back to the game, no keyboard keys work anymore for some odd reason, but it can be quickly fixed by alt+tabbing out then back in so it's not much of a big deal. It is also a big time button masher when it's combat time. So to avoid killing your hand from left clicking insanely, use a controller to play. Great game, 8/10",

        {
            "review_text": "I don't even know where to start...  1. Uplay  After launching the game from Steam, you will be redirected to Uplay. You will create your account, the launcher will install and patch for 30 minutes, to finally crash when login. The solution is to uninstall it and download it from the website. Once you loged in, you will have to avoid the agressive ads from Far Cry 4 and every freaking AC game to click on the play button.   2. The Story  The story is by far the worst in the game. Ubisoft, if you bring back the prince from the sands trilogy, why don't you make a story related to it? Ha, you wanted to play with the feelings of the fans of the saga to make some quick cash. 'Hey look, we are going to bring back the sands saga' BULL SHEIT. Not only you make a standalone story with no conexion with other games, but you change completely the background of the saga. C'mon, who the hell is that brother who came out of nowhere? And what about the sands? Now they were created by a woman who lives in the clouds?  Ok, I get it. You created a new story, I could deal with it if it made sense by itself. But it's a horrible story, predictable, full of cliches, like a story for kids. The only original part is when a woman turns herself into a sword that can speak. It's original, but pathetic.  3. Music/Sounds  Let's move on to the music. In the original trilogy, the soundtrack was outstanding. From charming arab melodies, to agressive rock, there was always an amazing song playing while you were fighting enemies, or exploring, or making puzzles. But here we will find nothing. Some horrible melodies in the main menu and some other noise while you fight. Period.  The sounds effects are ok, but recycled from other games. Anyway there aren't so many sounds, only the sound of water, the sound of the wind, and the sound of the swords.  Ah, and acting voice (in spanish) is really, really awful. The actors play like they have no soul, or like they want to finish their job soon, get paid and go home. I don't think english voices are better.  4. Characters.  The main character is our beloved prince from the sands of time trilogy, but he seems to not remember anything from the first game. He is so amused whe he sees a f***ing sand of time. C'mon man, you look so ret*ard in this one.  The other character is the brother of the prince, who came out of nowhere with a entire realm for himself. I can't stand this character, thanks god that appears only for 10 minutes in the story.  Then we have a woman who lives in the clouds that turns herself into a sword. I don't even have words for this.  Enemies are repetitive and easy as hell. The will stare at you until you kill'em.  5. Combat  From the nearly 20 combos and different attacks in the first game, to the almost infinite combos of the last 2 games... to the 3 attacks in this one. You can't even block...  Time powers are awful as well. The only decent is the rewind power, which appears in the other games. Other awesome powers disappeared in this one. Well, you can use an ability to turn your skin into stone, to make yourself invulnerable, making the game easier.  6. Gameplay  It feels like a point and click game. You kill enemies clicking on the mouse. Then you have the platforms, where you only have to push the space bar. You don't need to think, just presh the god*damn buttons. You have ONE puzzle, that can be made in less than 3 minutes if you are not so ret*ard as the people who made this game are.  The game is so easy I have died only because of bugs, making it a fast-pace game, which is good, because when I played it, I just wanted to finish it as soon as possible, uninstall it, write the review, and go back to the original trilogy to forget this piece of sheit.  7. Bugs  Oh man, I could write a trilogy of books and maybe make a movie out of the bugs in this game. You will experience a lot of lag, fallings through the world, and many situations where the prince is dead, but he is alive. I mean, after being hitted, 90% of the times he falls to the ground and is not able to get up, like he was dead, but you see the health bar almost full, and the only thing you can do is rewind or restart the game.  In the final boss you will face, not that passive demon who will wait until you kill him, but the boss o bugs. The prince is likely to stop moving, to stick in the ground, while he is still alive. In that moment, you are invulnerable, which it means that the boss or the ads will not hurt you. You can't even rewind on time, so you see yourself forced to restar the game.  8. Graphics  The only part of the game that doesn't suck. The graphics, overall, are amazing, even 4 years after. Solid and highly detailed. But the scenarios are empty, really repetitive, and the lack that charisma that all the scenarios from the other games has.  9. Controls  You will use only the space bar, WASD, and the left button of the mouse, son the controls don't mess up so much, just a bit lag while platforming (the prince jumps like 2 seconds after hitting the jump button, most of times). Camera is bad, but compared to other aspects of the game, is pretty decent.  10. Other stuff  There are more crappy things in the game, like that useless ability tree, but it doesn't matter anymore since the game is broken since the first second.  Conclusion  Do never buy or play this game, even if you are a die-hard PoP fan. Specially if you are a PoP fan. This game just destroys the entire saga. Disrepectful game.",

It has the same plot and setting as every game in the Sands of Time trilogy, the same old Prince (snarky, not angsty) as ever, and the same kinds of puzzles and fights. (To be fair, the Prince gets a couple new abilities that he's never seen before to spice things up. Nothing groundbreaking, though.) However, it has refined all these so that the bad elements - quick time events, awkward chariot races, angsty Prince from the second game - have been removed and the good ones rebalanced to make them better.

All in all a great game and I hope theres either a sequel or another remake because the story of prince of persia is one I will never be tired of and the movie was ♥♥♥♥ing sick.",
