            "review_text": "If you are reading this review right now, and consider buying the game, do it. It's that simple, the game is totally worth the money. First of all, it's a First Person Shooter Tower Defense game. It's rules are simple:  - Choose your personal Towers and Weapons. - Build blocks to create a maze as big as possible.  - Build towers using resources that you gain for completing waves. - Upgrade your gear and towers. - Defend the core at all cost.   Sanctum has this good feeling of progression. Each new wave provides another, a more difficult challenge. And the player must keep up. By upgrading the towers and weapons. Which by the way, come in a surprisingly pleasant number. There are a lot of different towers to choose from. Some are used to deal damage to the creatures on the ground, and some to those airborn. So it's a good idea to buy them both, and experiment with their placement. Another very nice addition, are the 'Support Towers'. They can manipulate your enemies in various ways. The 'Slow Field' for example, slows every creature that steps on the ground where it's placed. There also towers that amplify both yours and your tower's attacks, make your enemies more susceptible to damage, and so on. Speaking of enemies, each type of creature has it's own good looking alien body. That comes with a certain, sometimes hidden, area called the 'Weakspot'. Each alien has it's own unique abilities, like 'Charging', 'Soaking', 'Dodging', well, you get the point. They not only behave differently, but also look so. Very cool and fantastic-looking models.   Your towers are the main source of firepower in Sanctum. But the player is as important. You get to choose from 6 unique weapons like the 'Sniper', 'Freeze',and 'Tesla' guns. Which come in very handy when dealing with certain enemies. Especially those that somehow survived your defenses. You can create some really awesome guns and towers combinations if you think about it. You could, for example, use your 'Freeze' gun to temporarily stun all the enemies in a certain radius. And then blow them all away with a charged 'REX'. It's really awesome come to think about it.   Another thing worth mentioning is the variety of maps (16 if have the DLCs) and game mods (like Bounty, Stamina, Pre-Build, and Standart). Which add a certain feeling of freedom. And the maps are pretty awesome. They look vibrant and alive, full of fauna and flora. Which is so strange looking that it makes you love it. Giant spores, glowing trees, multiple Suns, huge flowers, and mineral-rich caves. But the best thing about the maps, are the Easter Eggs. There are so many secret spots to find. So well-hidden and camouflaged, that you'll spend some time looking for them, and when you'll finally find them, they'll put a smile on that face.    And now, my favorite subject, the Music. I never thought I'd enjoy Sanctum's music so much as I do. Every map has 2 pieces of music attached to it. The first one plays in the 'Building' phase. Usually a rather slow and tuneful loop, which I always like. And the second piece plays while the 'Action' phase is in progress. A very pulsing, rhythmic and dynamic song, that I just love. Just listen to   THIS   or   THIS  . Please do, they might seem simple and plain, but they feel so complex and sparkling. 16 different maps, 2 songs for each... You do the math. All the credit goes to Coffee Stain Studios, and more specificaly to the genius Gustaf Tivander.   The last but not least, the best feature of this game is the Cooperative play. You and up to three of your friends get to build, upgrade and defend together. It's fun and effective, it grants even more creativity and firepower. Letting you get the most of this game. Which I strongly recommend if you're looking for either a good Co-op, or Tower Defense.      10/10 ",

Not only that - the way that it beutifully satisfies the different types of players in Co-op means (outside of Portal 2), its the game you have to have as a co-op.   I would like to see some more maps, but with Sanctum 2 here - Im thinking this is not something I am ever likely to see. But, counterbalance this with what is now a very reasonable price, and you've got yourself a highly enjoyable game thats worth the spend when your looking to share your evenings with that special IP address.",

After that's all done, you get some real twitch-shooter fun. I was dissapointed that there wasn't any real content or story, but the mechanics are just great enough to keep me comming back for wave after wave.   Sanctum will make you think, but not too hard.   7/10",

It's more strategic and less furious action than team shooter games, so, I find, it is good for couples co-op play (husband and wife, or boyfriend and girlfriend). The game has action, with your character shooting down the incoming aliens, and also strategy, with your team building a maze of defensive towers and choosing which kind of towers. The goal of the game is stop the aliens from destroying your core (home base building). I find this can be a more satisfying, constructive goal than a goal of simply killing aliens (or killing other players). The game is nicely implemented and fun to play, as is its sequel.",

Combining TD and FPS is what makes this game so enjoyable. In the setup phase you have time to build walls and towers, as well as upgrade them (and your own weapons). Once you hit enter, the wave starts and you don't have to watch your towers doing the work - you jump into the action yourself. The towers might be powerful but there's certain things they can't do which you can. Aiming for enemies weakness spots for instance. Overall a really enjoyable game.",

For the longest time, this game was overpriced. It has finally come down to 10$ (5$ on sale) that seems a bit more reflective of the content recieved. The online co-op definately has some problems, however the game is brought together by the soundtrack, graphics, and cool dlc towers. If you are a huge tower defense fan then this game is worth it. If you are a huge FPS fan that doesn't care much about tower defense, you will hate this game.   Let me make this clear: DUNGEON DEFENDERS IS SUPPERIOR IN EVERY WAY!  I got this game after Dungeon Defenders, so I didn't get to enjoy it much before DD spoiled me. DD is only 15$ (less on sale) and is MUCH more worth it for fun tower defense co-op gameplay. GET DUNGEON DEFENDERS. Then if you still want more, get Sanctum. ~PR0XIDIAN",

The Violator DLC is lovely, the mazebuilding maps are good, but the others are mostly forgettable and it cries out for third-party map support (or just more maps) rather than the sequel it's getting.",

The difference here is the game is extremely polished, and plays relatively straight forward, I can't really elaborate since it simply provides tower defense (contruction) with hero combat (FPS). The only real flaw I can find in this game for what it is, is the forced heavy use of the FPS component (upgrading assault is pretty much necessary, and takes priority over such things as mazing, investing in tower combos). Great game and great price too, a definite recommendation.",

Even more, the fact that you get guns doesn't really detract from the sheer fun of the Maze-Build-Upgrade gameplay that is at the heart of the genre. Now, this one is fairly solid-- it has a mazing apparatus built into it, out of which you form your other towers, meaning no space is wasted with powerless towers-- but I wish there was slightly less focus on the gunning aspect of it. Like I said earlier, the game fixates on this fact, and instead of allowing you to opt-out of firing alongside your towers, several waves in every attempt consist entirely of enemies you must kill yourself.",

The single Big Walkers are a total cheat, but you can get through them. Just make sure you can keep from losing forty percent of your core's life. Preparation is key, and the game encourages routing &amp; tower placement. Don't expect to be successful with shooting alone.  The soundtrack is great. It's a mix of electronica that intermingles with the style of the game well. It - like many tower defense games - makes heavy use of sci-fi aesthetics, so the soundtrack is appropriate and welcome. The only beef I have is that some tracks are reused on some maps. I'd say pick this up if you have any interest in tower defense or tactical turn-based games &amp; get the soundtrack while you're at it.",

There are few varities of monsters, mostly stronger versions as the battle goes on. Furthermore you get no income for killing monsters, you just get a static amount for completing each section.

            "review_text": "Ok, so I decided I would redo my Sanctum 1 review since I did terrible Sanctum 2, so I'll just explain why I prefer THIS one over the 2nd one.  PROS:  The game itself: I want to point this out to EVERYONE who apparently likes Sanctum 2 better, Sanctum 1 is a tower based game with FPS elements, so you can help your towers out as well as have something to do than just sit there. The 2nd one is FPS based with towers involved and I HATE that, the best part about the first one was the huge maps, level up weapons, level up towers and killingfloors to high levels to do a s%#ton of damage with, teleport around the place getting in enemies faces, get infront of them to block them off so they couldn't get closer, etc. and that's why I loved it, the FPS part was just there for some entertainment and to help out friends/towers so you would have something to do  Large maps: A good chunk of the maps in this game are actually really big, seriously, some of the maps are ginormous and you have to be careful about where you put your towers, as well as where you should stand to help them out.  Weapons/Pick your own weapons: There are multiple weapons to pick from, i'm not going to list them all but i'll say my favorties are R.E.X., the Tesla Gun, and the Sniper, and leveling them up means more damage and more ammo, as well as quicker reload times. And to top it all off you can pick your weapons instead of being forced 1 weapon, AND you also get 3 weapons instead of 2, making it more fun.  Level up weapons: This is another thing I adored about the first one, the level up system for weapons. How this works is that you switch to your weapon inbetween rounds with SHIFT, and hold LMB (if you have enough money) And it upgrades it to the next level, the higher the level the more damage you do with it, there is a limit but it does a lot of damage.  NO. F%$KING. TOWER LIMIT: I hated this SO MUCH about the 2nd, there isn't a tower/block limit, there isn't, if you have the money and it isn't blocking the enemies path then you can put it there, and that's why I liked it, I hate how the 2nd one you have a limit, why a limit? That was one of the great things about the first one.  No stupid boss fights: There are no boss fights in this game, and that's another thing I like and don't like, I wish there was a big enemy to fight but in the 2nd one he's just a a$$hole. Me and my friends spent 20 minutes in Sanctum 2 on the last wave and putting towers in places and making a longer maze for the boss, well apparently the boss gave us a middle finger and plowed through it all, making all of our time and money utterly useless, after we saw that we quit and played the first game again.  Towers: Like I said in the first statement that this is a Tower based game with FPS elements, which means the towers do a good chunk of work and you are the support instead of it being vice versa. There are multiple types of towers, my personal favorties are the killing floor which sits on the ground, and any enemy that runs over it takes damage, AND slows him down for a few seconds, and theres also this one with a long a$$ neck that pretty snipe enemies from across the map in a few hits. There are others of course, try em out!  Teleport system: If you fall off the map or are wanting to go up to the front/back of the complex to get at enemies or just for the fun of it you can teleport around if you put down some teleport pads, makes it easy to swap around the map and help out friends or to get to enemies quickly instead of running there.  You can't die: Yup, you aren't able to die at all and I like that a lot, it doesn't put a whole lot of tension or anything, if you fall off the map you just pick a place to teleport at with no worries.  Core: The Core is what you are trying to protect the aliens from, if too many get in it explodes and you lose, the bigger the enemy the more health it takes off, and you can't get any back, so keep those b@$#ards away from it at all costs.  No timer: I hated this about the 2nd as well, in the first inbetween rounds you get no timer, as much time as you need to set up your maze for enemies or put towers in places, get to certain high points for sniping, anything. In the 2nd inbetween rounds half the time you get like 30 seconds to do whatever it is you have to before it starts and I hated that.  Enemy hits: If a enemy hits you you don't lose health or anything, he just knocks you back and shakes your camera around, making it a little woozy, then when your senses come back you can go after the guy that hit you.  CONS:  Teleport pads: At times when I was playing I would hug against a wall so I wouldn't get knocked back, but I ran back somehow cause a telepad came down to pick me up and I went back too far and into the hoard on the other side and I kind of got stuck. I don't know if this is a nitpick or something that people hate cause my friends do it constantly as well and they get annoyed with it.  Towers: Some towers feel utterly useless, for instance there is a slow-pad for the floor like a Killing Floor is used, it slows the enemies down alot but doesn't do damage, when the Killing Floor does damage and slows them down abit. And some are useful for only certain types, for instance gattling guns are for ground units only, and missile launchers for air targets only, some of them are mixed though, so they hit both air and ground units.  Longer waves mean harder enemies: When you upgrade all of your towers and weapons you would imagine you would be set, sadly that isn't true, as waves go on enemies get harder and harder with each wave, one time I had all of my towers (except 2-3) and all of my weapons upgraded and I was expecting to wipe the floor with everyone, but halfway through the wave the enemies were getting past my maze pretty quickly, and still had chunks of health left so I had to go back to the core and pick them off one by one, I lost sadly. I would recommend you play with friends that way you can all gang up on the aliens.  WHAT I THINK: I think this was the actual good game of the 2, even half of my friends who played the 1st and 2nd prefer the 1st one instead, I still play this game on occassion because it's still entertaining to me, and I love it for that, it has quite high replayability, and the text-to-voice chat system is just downright hilarious, I give this game a 8/10, it needs some fixing with some things but it's still very fun all around. Worth it on a sale or as it sits!",

What do I build? How do I counter the upcoming enemies? Do I build, or upgrade? Then during the combat phase, you focus on typical FPS aspects: Run, jump, strafe, shoot etc.  The cherry on top is that these things play off each other. You can build towers just to do damage, or you can build them to give yourself an easier time with your gun by slowing enemies or amplifying damage. Or, you can slow or even stun enemies adjacent to high-damage towers to squeeze more out of them. Path layout is critical, yet many strategies exist.
