Since I am merely a poser, waited for a sale but still found it well worth it. Very fast paced and gets really hard really quickly, but still a lot of fun! easy 8/10!",

Dig the weapon upgrade mechanics, because there are always these fun moments when you need to wind your way through a bunch of bullets to pick up the right upgrade, and it forces you to make a choice - endanger yourself in order to do more damage, or play it safe and live to fight another day.",
