    "description": "The catapult officer calls for full afterburner. 50,000 pounds of thrust spools behind you as your F-14 strains for release. Less than three seconds later your Tomcat screams through the air at 150 knots. You climb to meet your wingman, then head off to join the fight.",

            "review_text": "One of the most important 90's flight-sims, created by one of the most important 90's flight-sim studios. F-14:FD is a study sim of said bird, with moderate-to-high complexity, particularly in the AWG-9 radar modelling and carrier landings. It was one of the benchmark simulations of its day (hard to believe that was 20 years ago as of this writing... where does the time go?) and while the sim's graphics are certainly a smeary, muddy 320x200 mess, the underlying game still holds up well. There's a campaign mode (blow the filthy Commie Scum out of the North Atlantic), scramble (quick mission builder) mode, and even a full mission builder.   Some caveats: first, this is a DOS game, running under DOSBox. I'm not sure if Night Dive Studios made any additional modifcations to the sim other than DOSBox settings, but I know from past experience that FD behaves well under DOSBox so there isn't any problem there. Still, you'll need to understand and futz with DOSBox settings if you want your joystick throttle to work. Second: this is a complex simulation, not a kick-the-tires-and-light-the-fires kind of deal. You will want to read the (hefty) game manual, and you need to understand that you're taking the role of TWO people in the Tomcat -- both the pilot and the RIO. The workload wasn't everyone's bag of tea even back in the 90's, when simheads were two-fisted men of iron and tobacco spit.  So should you, the reader, buy this game? YES if you are deeply interested in how the (now-retired) Tomcat worked and fought, and don't mind aged (yet somehow still compelling) graphics. There will probably never be a better Turkey sim than this one.  NO if ancient textured polygons bother you, or you're not interested in a simulation more complex than War Thunder. Or are an Eagle pilot, which means you have other problems that nobody can help you with :)",
