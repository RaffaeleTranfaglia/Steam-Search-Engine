I bought the game and started playing, trying to figure out how to make something that was self-sufficient whenI realized how much time I was spending. This game is bound to keep you entertained for a few hours, it did for me, and more often than not the random creatures spawned will beat what you're trying to make, but will completely fail for a while, so have fun with it.",
