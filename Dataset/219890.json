You slowly see it unveil as you make progress. -The main feature that I like is that you never know what to expect in the next step you make. The map is full of surprises. -The design is beautiful and unique. -The game requires you to pay attention to details and think outside the box, then you will realize that the solution was right in front of your eyes. It has its own logic and its own specific style, and once you come in terms with it, you will love and appreciate every single puzzle.  Cons: -The music gave me headache after some hours into the game, so I had to turn the volume down. It's supposed to be soothing, but I personally found it a bit annoying. -There is no Antichamber 2",

The game offers many philosophical messages which you will completely miss as you try to comprehend what to do and where to go.

The game clearly has its own consistent internal logic and random things don't just occur to mess with the player's head. However, many of Antichamber's puzzles depend on upsetting the usual order of things to - if the tablets of advice hidden around the game are to be believed - teach a lesson about life. It is not terribly uncommon, for example, to turn around and find yourself in a different place than where you came from. It makes no logical sense, but over time, it becomes a reasonable solution. While still sporting more straightforward puzzles like covering a series of sensors with a limited number of blocks, Antichamber seems to more often beg the player to look at the problem sideways. Instead of looking for tools to get around obstacles, understand that every situation may not operate under the same set of rules. Be willing to adjust assumptions based on new observations. But these observations need to be made independently by the player as the game itself provides no real external assistance; even the ultimate purpose of the game isn't handed to the player. Without guidance, you're left to discover your own meaning to the strange and sometimes inconsistent world around you - just as everyone must do as they progress through life.",

You are wondering what that 'Antichamber' is, while you are trying to succeed. There isn´t much explanation needed, it´s easy to progress by trial and error and you still won´t get upset. I really enjoy the design, as weird as it is, and I always managed to play on. There are also a lot of hidden hints, all over the map, which is enourmous. Later you can even unlock some helpful abilities while you´re trying to find out what´s going on.   If you doubt like I did, don´t wait to buy it. If you like Puzzles, you will love this!",

            "review_text": "Antichamber is a game in which I would describe a 'simulation' game. There are many types of simluation games, and this one does very well at simulating the process of being on drugs.  For the most part, Antichamber is a very simple game. You walk into walls to get guns so you can turn the black box man into an optical illusion. You can also click on pictures of bears and children that give hints along the way.  If you want a challenge of a game, this is the game for you as it tests your ability to stay sane while it spits weed out of your computer that you unintentionally smoke during the game. This likely explains why I feel different after playing an hour or two of this game.  All of the puzzles in this game are actually much more logical than they may seem, though you only find this out after you FINISH the puzzle and click on the hint duck pictures. Assuming you are NOT on drugs and can in fact read, I recommend you read the hints and take them into consideration. The signs never lie, just like people on the internet.  If I had to rate this game, I would probably give it a 400.20/420. There wasn't really a story at all, I guess is why that is. Otherwise I'd give it a full blazed 420/420. The art style is so simple yet fantastic, the puzzles are much more difficult than I was prepared for, and there were so many moments that I went 'OH that was SO satisying to finish!' though I may have been saying that about the weed that kept coming out of my computer. I HIGHly recommend this game.",

If you had your sanity on the way in, chances are you lost it somewhere between the chirping bird corridors, the ending never-ending circle-spiral and the 23rd time you went down that same corridor by accident (except it wasn't that corridor, something's different this time). If you never had your sanity in the first place, you might regain some, this place probably makes perfect sense.  Buy this game if you like Legend Of Zelda dungeons, Portal maps or thinking. Don't buy it if you don't like fun, challenges or insanity.   Reality is an illusion! The world is a hologram! Buy gold!  Infinite cubes!  PS - Say hi to the purple cube for me.",

Your tool shall evolve as you progress, as the quotes you encounter unfold a story of pictures.  You will create plant life, gardens of inward growth. Your gardens will transform into animals, primitive snakes of sorts, slithering upon command. You progress, a plague, a virus, horrendous, beautiful, but limited in dimension.  Your final form, a carrier, a harbringer of death, a black hole, a plague. The end of all, yet a beginning of a life of wisdom.  You play the story of one who creates life and death amidst a grand puzzle in which you attempt to define the impossible with what seems real to you. Only by performing the unconventional action within an unconventional space, rather than the conventional action within the unconventional space (which is not the same as performing a conventional or unconventional action in a conventional space) can you hope to progress.

            "review_text": "To be honest, I feel the word 'game' berates antichamber. It's art in it's most purest form. It's about learning to think in non-linear paths, about approaching situations in different ways and memorizing and advancing in ways you're not used to. In more ways than one, this game is absolute madness, playing tricks with positioning that no sane mind would be able to memorize. However, in that process, it does offer a whole array of puzzles that make you feel good once you figure them out (okay...most of 'em. There are one or two really frustrating amongst them). The pictures and text feel better than all superfluous 'achievement unlocked''s combined.  The aesthetics may take some getting used to. It's all white, white and more white, but it grows on you. Coupled with the soft music, it really puts your mind at ease.  At first, I thought the whole game would be about brain puzzles. And while that was true, the block gun (and variants) do a good job of spicing things up without sacrificing neither the puzzle element nor the atmosphere.  I normally take the time to point out some the game's flaws, but in this case it would be a shame. Yes, some puzzles are frustrating, but is it because they ARE frustrating or because it requires the sort of thinking I personally am not accustomed to? It's probably the latter. And I really can't bring myself to criticizing the confusing structure of the whole, as it's that very structure that I come to adore. I mean...how many other games do you know where there's a 7-floor tower, complete with a sort-of-elevator shaft in the middle...where those seven floors are rooms that are located directly next to each other?  I just finished it for the second time (first time being a few years ago). As expected, I had sort of forgotten the harder puzzles, making it all the more challenging. And I'll probably replay it again in a few years from now. For puzzle games, that's a pretty unique feat. Take it for what it's worth. If there was a contest for best puzzle game ever, I'd not only nominate this, but criticise everyone who doesn't at least considers it.  In summary: best puzzle game ever. And I don't throw these nominations around lightly. ABSOLUTELY recommended.",

My preconceptions were that this was going to be another portal clone - well that thought was shattered pretty quickly. It's more of a personal experience that focuses on how you approach Antichamber.  Puzzles are unique, different, and mindblowing. The only way i can describe when encountering them is the difference between veteren gamers and new gamers. Veteren gamers understand, and take for granted the logic and rules governed by most video games, while new gamers have to learn this process. For Antichamber, it abides by it's own rules - to the point that veteren gamers have to unlearn everything, while new gamers can learn the world without being hindered by pre-existing gamer knowledge. Unless you are a wizard that is!  The game progresses well, as you learn new concepts and apply them to other puzzles ... until the game pulls the rug under your feet like the slave you are. Here is an idea of what was going through my head for the majority of the puzzles. 'WHAT'?, 'Ok....', 'WHY AM I HERE', 'WHERE DO I GO', 'THIS GAME SENSE NONE'.  Stuck on a puzzle? No problem, move on to another and come back to it later. The intuitive map allows you to choose where to go next.   Aesthetics are simple with a uniquely distinctive art style. A white background with bright colours. The right contrast to entice you into the world, yet not distracting when taking in the environment to solve a puzzle. Accompanying the visuals is a soundtrack with various natural sounds.  The only negatives i can think of is if you don't like puzzles then this will be a frustrating experience. I had to take a break after solving several, although that comes with the genre more than anything.  I have been gaming for a long time and nothing has been quite as fresh and breathtaking of a experience than this game. My all time favourite.  10/10",

            "review_text": "Antichamber, a game which hardly makes sense, except that sense is not required here, because all you have to really use is your brain, making your way through your 'life'. Basically this game is to teach some meanings of life, in a fun way, you have to make through various puzzles using tips used in real life, like for example: If you only think of right now, you won't have enough for later. Things that you mother and father would tell you during the course of your life. I can say that this game is not really supposed to have a story, I could say that this is mostly a game to think to solve the puzzles, and maybe learn something which is going to be REALLY useful in your life, in a fun way, until you are able to finish your 'quest' or as it can be seen in this game, your 'life'.  Graphics: I'll say that the graphic is quite simple, but yet very attractive and colorful (I love colorful games!) in some parts, and the block gun look very interesting and ironically, reverses the conditions colors I like to use specially in survival games (Blue for perfect health, Green for little damage, yellow for medium damage and red for heavy damage), being the first on the blue and the last the Red gun, as a little downside, I think most of the corridors were a little lifeless, the walls were all white, it gives you a strange feeling of lolyness, maybe it was the intention of the game (9.5/10) Story: Like mentioned before, I believe this game wasn't really made to have a story, except for learning some meanings of life in a fun way, and the player (which the appearance is unknown) must pass the challenges in his 'life', none of the happenings made any sense at all, like, why (s)he was there, who was (s)he, and what happened in the ending (I'll avoid making spoilers). The story didn't make much sense, so I'm afraid the story will get a so so rating, but hey! Just because the story is confusing somewhat doesn't mean the game is bad! (6/10) Sound: Whoa, how I did like the sounds in the game, the sounds gave quite a good touch to the game, when you are falling at a very high speed, that good sound of the air passing on your ears, when you land, and the sounds of you moving, absorbing and firing the blocks, gave a great touch to the game, in any moment I never got tired of the sound effects, and the music was very calm, a perfect music to let the player think through the puzzles, I simply have nothing but good things to say about the sounds (10/10) Depth: Depending on how well can you think on the solution of the puzzles, the game can take quite a while to beat (I almost beat the game 100% in around 20 hours, being some of those hours idle), and having various different paths, including some deadends, if you are looking to explore everything in the game, it's going to take a while, if you are just aiming to find the exit, the game will be a bit shorter, looking at the map (there is a map of the rooms explored on the wall of the game start chamber), the game seems to have needed to have a few more rooms. (8/10) Addictiveness: Awesome, I can safely say that until I could find almost all the black signs (you can see all the black signs you found during the game on the game start chamber), I never got tired of the game, but after I've given up to find the last 5 black signs, I didn't really feel like playing again. (8/10) Difficulty: I can say that the difficulty is at it's exact point to the human mind, the challenges fits exactly accordingly to a smart person, I had to put a lot of thought through the challenges, to solve 'em, some were simple, and some you had to be more experienced and have more 'Tools' to work them out.

            "review_text": "I don't think I've fallen in love with a game more instantaneously than I have with Antichamber. While I'm far from considering myself a 'classic gamer', one thing I find a bit exasperating about almost all modern games is how they will persistently hold your hand in a manner that, even if it doesn’t remove the challenge entirely, certainly does a lot to insult your intelligence. You will not run into this problem in Antichamber, and this for me is its main charm. Much like the very first Legend of Zelda game, AC starts you out in an unknown, unexplained world and you have to learn the rules by yourself, some writing on the walls telling you how to control your newfound matter gun (which I didn't even find until maybe 2 hours in playing the game and honestly completely forgot about until I did) and upgrades the only real guides you'll be getting, aside from some delightful life lessons you only receive after completing the puzzles they refer to. The simple puzzles quickly become daunting and brain-teasing, though a small few can become a bit tedious (and one puzzle in particular, albeit optional and only leading to an extra dev room, is complete and utter BS). However, for the most part the game has an excellent track record of keeping your mind stimulated and providing many rewarding and even cathartic moments, and many puzzles are an absolute joy for me to replay over and over again.  I also love the game’s minimalist presentation. You’ll be spending a lot of your time in pure white hallways, frequently visiting rooms that sport a color scheme ripped out of an MS Paint palette, but the game finds ways to use even its graphic simplicity to its advantage (many of the game’s puzzles and tricks wouldn’t work too well, I don’t think, in a more detailed aesthetic). I’ve seen people refer to the game as “ugly”, and while it certainly isn’t too easy on the eyes, it still finds ways to look just as charming as it plays.  At a glance, the game could easily be describled as 'Portal with blocks” (even though development on this game started a year before Portal was released), but what sets it apart from its mad scientist peer more than anything is while Portal follows a very linear storyline, AC is completely open, nonlinear, and ready and waiting to have every conceivable corner explored—as soon as you figure out your way around. Another important difference that makes AC stand on its own is that where Portal’s theme is based around physics, science and strict logic, AC’s theme is its complete and utter deconstruction of your preconceptions of logic and reality, and while logic isn’t necessarily completely absent from the game, it has created its own, new set of rules that, again, you have to figure out for yourself.  This game did have me stumped on more than a few occasions and I will admit have committed the sin of using a walkthrough to help me through a few of them (although all but one of them ended up being dev rooms), but after seeing the answers its clear that a player’s inability to proceed really does simply stem from their lack of ability to put pieces together rather than a negligence of giving you all the tools you need and teaching you how to use them—there are plenty of subtle, clever lessons leading up to larger problems, but it’s up to you to actually learn them and keep them in your head.  Overall, I’d say my only big complaint with Antichamber is that there isn’t more of it. There’s no real extra content aside from the hidden dev rooms, and apart from restarting your save file to finish with a faster time there isn’t exactly much in the way of replay value, and asking for a sequel to a game like this in my opinion would be outrageous. Still, if Bruce does come up with something, I’d love to see it and will be the first in line to get it. :) This game is without a doubt one of the finest I’ve played and is an absolute must-have for puzzle game enthusiasts.",

If you love puzzles that are so headache-inducingly ingenious that the preposterous becomes intuitive, or if you just like to have your gray matter tickled, I'd definitely recommend this game.  One downside I'd note, though, is that - for some people, such as myself - the game is not only figuratively, but also literally headache-inducing. I'm not sure whether it's the brightness of the visuals, the ambient sound design, or what, but I found it difficult to play this game for extended stretches of time, which is a shame because the game is quite addicting!  Oh, I should also add, the game was very kindly gifted to me; I would not say it's worth its current price tag, though how long you'll be playing it will strongly depend on your wits and your willpower to resist looking up strategy guides.",

You aquire some gun-like objects that allow you to control some qube-like objects, which will help you pass the puzzles, and by 'help you' i mean that they are necessary equipement to do so.  The whole game is based on puzzles that make you think you are free to do anything you want while in reallity you are not.

            "review_text": "Antichamber is a weird game to review, as it stands on a league of its own. It's not trying to be a good game. On the contrary, it's actually throwing most conventions out the window, and challenging the player to see it through.    Let's say it's a first person puzzle game. If you need a comparison, Portal would be a decent choice. However, where Portal clearly gives you the mechanics and expects you to use them to solve the puzzles, Antichamber makes you dig a lot to find those mechanics and how it all fits and interacts. The game is purposely trying to bend the players' minds at every turn, and it certainly succeeds in doing exactly that!   I'm not going to do the usual review on this game. It simply wouldn't work, and would achieve nothing. So I'm going to try to convey the game's fundamental aspects, and you'll then judge for yourself if you're interested enough.    The game also has some Metroid-vania elements regarding its map. However, while those games obey 'real-world' rules, Antichamber laughs at them. The whole game is a non-Euclidian maze (meaning it doesn't obey 3D geometry rules -- when you turn back, the rooms may have changed; maybe you can go down enough that you're back where you're started; you get the idea). However, you are given a very useful map, which functions almost as a progress meter. With its use, you'll know *some* of the connected areas, but above all else, you'll know when there are still ways to uncover in a given room.   Antichamber is essentially about sheer willpower and deconstruction. You're not given anything. Instead, you need to find it yourself, and then experiment with your new tools to solve more of the puzzles. The game also has a few signs with messages, giving you feedback for your actions (and the meaning of life, if you're so inclined). It works almost as  post-tutorialization . The game is about learning for yourself. About having to learn to progress. Since the knowledge you had previously (as conventions) doesn't work, you'll have to start from the very beginning. To solidify your discoveries, the game usually gives you a short phrase (and picture) to relate it to life itself. And it helps giving context to what you're doing, setting it all in stone.   Eventually, you'll be able to make the game's logic almost conventional, weirdly enough. You adapt to the weird world you've been thrown in, and it feels great to realize how far you've come.   There are lots of branching paths, each leading to a new puzzle. However, you have a Hub Area in which you can jump into every puzzle directly (after you've found it). It would be impossible to complete the game without it, since traversing the map is everything but convenient. This is also something that goes well with the fact that you'll be stuck a lot.  Either you haven't learned a certain mechanic well enough, or you're lacking a certain tool for a puzzle. But you'll be forced to turn back. And the game helps you with that a lot. So you'll be constantly trying out new puzzles, and shying away from others. It's fine. The game was made with that very intent, and it uses that to its advantage, avoiding a lot of frustration.    Another aspect is that there are mostly no wrong actions. Everything is a choice, and the game responds to everything you do -- it may just not be the answer you were looking for.  I've seen the question on the forums 'What's the point'? Well... there is not point, other than discovery, and basically deconstructing the world until you master its own way of thinking. You don't have anyone to save or kill. No reward waiting for you either. But curiosity will certaily keep you moving forward -- well, maybe not technically forward... up and to the right, maybe. Maybe backwards, who knows? -- and it's incredibly rewarding to solve some puzzles that were particularly difficult to you.     It is a very, very unique game. And it's hard to explain what it is or why anyone should play it. But I'll say this: it's the game I'd recommend to most people, even if they're not into games. And that's because it's an unique experience, not necessarily tied to traditional games. The same may happen with movies or even music. People may not like movies all that much, but there are some that are worth watching anyway, for one reason or another.   Again, it's on a league of its own. It also shares some similarities with Fez, in that regard. However, Fez requires you to take knowledge from outside of the game, while Antichamber requires you to throw all knowledge away.    There are also some Dev Rooms that will give you some information about the development of the game. It's nice that they're there.     If you want to be challenged, dazed and confused... Definitely get this game. And play it through without a guide, otherwise its charm is all lost. Persistence is important, but it's one of the most rewarding games I've played in a long, long time. And it works nicely as food for thought as well.   I have never played anything even remotely close to Antichamber (not saying it's the best game I've ever played, simply that it's very different from everything else I came across), and it's a well executed game. It's interesting not only in concept, but in practice as well. Give it a go!",

Oftentimes there are intermediate puzzles that you don't at all have to solve if you have learned a concept in order to be able to bypass them completely - but they are still there in order to be able to figure it out the first time.  I find the ambient soundtrack to be very effective and immersive.  The biggest negative for this game is that it's $20 for a 5-15 hour game.

For example, when a game tells you to pick a path typically as a player you will choose one or the other. This game however likes to play mind games and will show you there is always another path. (back the way you came)  Then the game gets more complicated as you progress and turns into a 'Portal Like' game where you have a gun that can shoot blocks that you can use to hold doors open or block lasers to solve various puzzles.  As an experience this game is great, especially if you enjoy watching your friends fail seemingly obvious puzzles.  As a game...it's lacking on many levels.  - no story - no objectives / goals - no death / failure state - not much to do besides walk around, and sold various block puzzles to get to more puzzles - no replayability once you solve everything - puzzles get extremely complicated causing the user to just stop playing after a while  In short.... This is a game you experience once, and only once. It's a great experience, and you will love it at first, and want to show your friends, however... you won't want to ever play it again, and you'll likely just forget it even exists.  NOT worth $19.99  IS worth $1",

Chambers can change without you knowing. Making 4 right turns doesn't guarantee you'll end up in the same spot.

The tool you have initially just lets you take and place colored blocks you find and move them around.

Channelling the spirit of Portal into an artsier indie package, it's a welcome experience for adventure/puzzle fans. On the other hand, it's prone to induce as much frustration as fun, especially when the labyrinthine environments and abstract progression conditions cause you to start running in circles. When combined with the surreal imagery, this can make it feel like some kind of bizarre purgatory which your starving soul will never escape.

If you are a fan of Portal this game brings that whole idea to the next level.  The hand-drawn/cell animation style is really cool, it's like a trippy dream.  One of the things that I liked about the level design is that the puzzles made sense. Without giving anything away, it felt like the levels all followed the same set of rules. There wasn't any infuriating puzzles that made you curse the developer, when you figured something out, it was like 'oh of course, that makes sense'. It really shows the developer's design skills when you can make an environmental puzzle challenging without resorting to stupid tricks.  The story: It leaves a lot open to interpretation, I don't want to ruin it, but there is something going on. It's creepy but not scary. Like you are waiting for something to jump out and attack you at some point. It keeps you on your toes and pushing you toward your ultimate goal.

            "review_text": "Fun Fact: Antichamber, is not a word (To my Knowledge). The word that comes to mind is Antechamber; being a form of Entry-Room before a main or primary room, but not neccessarily a Hall or Mud-Room either. It is a more formal type of architectural structure. Antichamber is an extremely unique puzzle game. You utilize something that most people describe as a knock-off of the portal gun in a less graphically enhanced portal puzzle room.  This is entirlely incorrect. Antichamber presents the player with a beautiful and expertisely executed Escher-Esque enviornment, It also arms you with a gun that seems to have the ability to dissasociate matter from it's original state to compact transport and replace it in it's perfect atomically structured state upon which it was recieved. It does not by any means create inter-dimensional thresholds acting as gateways between time space and matter to transport a carrier through to different locations.  Check yourself.  Why are we in the antichamber? What is this ominous black snake that hovers through the air and disregards the puzzles we must solve? Who knows. This is left undiscerned for %100 of the game. Antichambers entertainment value is derived from Progressing through puzzles that break what we know as the laws of Space and Time. Physics can be completely disregarded, a shear wall can be dissasembled with the use of the Matter-Gun and moments later grow back from nothing to a brand new wall. An obvious empty space can be walked upon but if it is jumped towards it remains empty, the floor can dissappear because you looked at it, some doors only open when you don't look at them, trying to go back the room you just came from can often become impossible because you rounded the corner.  The game is EXTREMELY unique, and difficult at times. It has points of Trial-and-Error but keeps those entertaining as well, as compared to most puzzle games creating a sense of droll repetativeness from them. No Story, but superb mechanics, awe inspiring enviornments, this is a game that I believe was made to take a step forward in what we can consider puzzle-based gameplay, it transcends normal puzzles, there is never a point of stopping and solving a tile-puzzle or the like. You progress to get four different guns with four different functions and the game makes you to use all the the things you learned to solve the final few puzzles in a dramatic and slightly adrenaline inducing chase-sequences.  If Antichamber isn't on your wishlist, you'd better own it.",

However, if one compares the progress you make in each game, Portal is definately the more linear game, while Antichamber is... DEFINATELY NOT linear. Antichamber will make you go forwards, backwards, side to side, through walls, chutes, and interconnected chambers, and all you have to help you are the many signs posted throughout the game, your matter gun [once you get it, of course], and your brains.  One issue is the control scheme, which is more or less locked; You move throughout the game using six keys off the keyboard, and your mouse manipulates the matter gun (shocking!). However, with regards to the mattergun, when you need to use the wheel button on your mouse, and your mouse either lacks one, or it doesn't respond when you press it in game, use the left ctrl key to make up for it; not informing the players that the left Ctrl is a viable button did put a damper on my own experience playing the game.  While Antichamber does not have any achievements at the time of this review, it can be easily said that if you play through Antichamber for the first time, I GUARANTEE you will say 'What the #$%^' at least a once... if you aren't just saying it through the entire game.",

The game constantly warps the space you're in, but I never feel like I see 'behind the curtain,' when or how it's being done.  As a narrative commentary on game design, this game is what I wished The Stanley Parable was. Everything The Stanley Parable  tells  you, Antichamber  shows  you. You actually  play  the philosophy, rather than going on a walk through a Source engine museum with a funny but empty commentary track.  Addendum: I thought for a bit about why The Stanley Parable was unsatisfying but Antichamber was satisfying. I think The Stanley Parable made too many assumptions about my behavior that weren't true; I thought I'd have choices I didn't. I couldn't pick up a coffee mug, or open the doors I wanted to open, or go any direction instead of one of two or three predictable hallways. I felt like it thought I was stupid, and every decision point felt contrived. Antichamber (and I realize this is subjective) somehow was always one step ahead of me. It accounted for every decision I made. I realize it's a less detailed world, so there's less possible decisions, I suppose, but it still has the effect of feeling genuine. The Stanley Parable was a set piece, Antichamber was an experience.",

It's just a solid, well-paced, enjoyable puzzle game that'll probably run you 5-9 hours depending on how much of a completionist you are.   There are a few hiccups along the way: a couple of minor technical issues disrupt the immersion a little bit, but the game's not broken by any means. Once or twice, a puzzle took me 10x as long as it should have just because a simple mechanic was never really explained, but again, that never ruined the experience. The atmosphere hints at some sort of minimalist story, but in the end there's no actual narrative—not that there needs to be one.  Those downsides are strongly outweighed by the good parts. The unique visual style looks much better in motion than it does in screenshots. The game's mindbending navigational chaos is counterbalanced by puzzles that you can't fail (or, at the least, that you can easily reset) and a world map that turns out to be extremely helpful for getting around. Furthermore, once the game does introduce a rule, it's consistent; once you learn something about the world, you can rely on that knowledge for the rest of your playthrough.  The end result is a highly satisfying and easily recommendable puzzle experience. If you're vaguely in the mood for this kind of thing, don't hesitate in picking it up.",

While I do recommend 'Antichamber', I cannot say I am highly entertained by it. If you enjoy solving puzzles for the sake of solving puzzles, I think this game is for you.

I love the concept of solving puzzles by figuring out the laws of the always changing realities within this game. But sometimes the puzzles are a bit phoned-in and feel out of place. When a good deal of the puzzles make you go 'a ha!' and then some are puzzles you've seen before - which makes them extra disappointing, if you stack them up to the mind bending ones.  The progression in this game isn't smooth at all. Maybe it's not meant to be. But I will say that your first hour of this game vs the rest of this game, are entirely different experiences. a joyful, steady progression, turns into a series of 'wtf''s that result in a deeply satisfying feeling for having progressed. It's like sprinting then being forced to take baby steps. Keep in mind, that's my personal experience with it. and the thing with puzzle games is that progression is partially based on the players ability to solve the puzzles. But the more the antichamber opens up, the more I started dabbling in rooms here and there, figuring out where I should be going next.   Very often, because of this, I'd be stuck on a puzzle, only to notice that a few rooms back (in a different direction than where I came from) there was a hint on how to solve it.... if only I had come through the 'correct' route. But there is no correct route. Which made me learn that backtracking and approaching a room from another direction is far more beneficial than just.... trying to solve the puzzle. I just plain don't like that.  Having said all that, I am enjoying this game a great deal. And will be pretty sad if/when I ever complete it. Because this game definitely has zero replay value (unless you arbitrarily want to complete it as fast as possible) as 90% of it's charm comes from initial impressions",

I should let you know that my first playthrough of this game was ~2 hours of my displayed playtime. On top of that, I've played this game when I haven't had Wi-Fi access, so this is only some of my time playing this game.  This game can best be summarized by a quote from the legendary band Smashmouth, 'So much to do, so much to see, so what's wrong with taking the backstreet? You'll never know if you don't go.'  You can go, start to finish, through this game in less than 10 minutes. You can also, without lingering or backtracking too much, spend hours on a single playthrough. And literally nothing changes in the maze. But the order you find things in - things you didn't know before but know now, assumptions you make one time that you test a different way another time - will likely change (unless you're a speedrunner, of course).  This is a game I recommend to anyone who enjoys lateral thinking puzzles, puzzles in general, exploration, and the works of Mondrian, Doesburg, Escher, and Dali.  Overall, I'd say this is one of the best games I've ever played, but using an arbitrary number to grade it wouldn't give it justice. If you need a tl;dr number out of 10, though, I'd say it's a 9/10.

At the same time, the game's unique sense of pacing keeps it from ever getting too frustrating. You can't die - instead if you get stuck you're able to instantly warp back to the main hub at any time. The main hub acts as a map where you can revisit any room you've discovered thus far, so you're able to tackle whatever area you want when you're ready to solve it and you're very rarely forced to do any excessive backtracking. There is a timer, but (without spoiling what happens if it runs out) there isn't much sense of urgency.

Many of the puzzle rooms seem outright impossible at the start of the game. As you progress further and further, the solutions generally become obvious as you gradually learn more advanced methods to solve the puzzles (these methods usually come along at the same time as an upgrade to your cube gun). The controls for moving the blocks from one spot to another can be a tad aggrivating when you're trying to move them around in 3D space rather than just inside the 2D puzzle sections.

Most 'puzzles' in this game are not traditional logic puzzles found predominantly in Portal, nor do they require the same cryptic detective work necessary for the Myst series. Instead what we have here are more like spacial brainteasers manifested into a 3d exploration game. The world plays around with what we expect to happen in a normal 3D environment, but it does not stick to the now popular perspective swap trickery like echochrome or fez. Every corner you turn you must learn something new about the world you exist in, and almost none of that applies to the next room. It somehow does this without ever contridicting itself. This is not a game for the man looking for a set of logic puzzles like soduko, which increase in difficulty but with static mechanics. It also does not contain any real narrative, instead preffering the abstract over explicit. But having a traditional story or characters would dilute the potent head trip offered up here.",

It is really confusing and seems to have started a career as a TOTAL ♥♥♥♥ because everytime you think you have the solution to a puzzle more complicated than the theory of ♥♥♥♥ing relativity you find out that all you had to do is turn around or jump or some ♥♥♥♥ like that! Ok, ok. I'll go over everything like a proper review.   The game mechanics are where the main focus is in this title and the 'fun' with quotes so large they could be mistaken for the side of Mozambique is the fact that there aren't really any game mechanics besides 'nothing is as it seems.' I see they have gone to the Assassin's Creed school for cynical as ♥♥♥♥ philosophy. This game isn't really fun, but its not supposed to be. It's supposed to kick your brain to the curb and ♥♥♥♥ upon it and it succeeds in that.   Graphics, or lack thereof. The graphics are the most overatted bit of gaming. I've seen great games be panned because you can't see the coffee stain on the main character's left armpit or can't see each vein individually as the main character lumbers his or her power suited self into the field of generic cover based tripe. The truth is that graphics are less important than a politicians promise and if they were a person they'd be like Dane Cook or something. This game has very little in the way of looks and that is fine. This game doesn't need to be fancy looking to ♥♥♥♥ with your head. My only problem with the aesthetic is that it seems empty. Portal used a similar, if not slightly more detailed method of sterile white environments, but the thing is that it worked better in Portal because you have characters that speak and are funny and such. Antichamber seems lost without something like that or a real goal.   Until, I found the end door, which is in the starting room and I didn't notice. I thought to myself, has this game been just a huge troll to lead me back here and inevitable notice that I had been staring at the End the whole time... No, there is a cheekily placed peice of glass in the way and about 20 minutes later when I found a way behind the glass the door was unopenable. Well played, Antichamber, well played.   Now, here's the part where I recommend it or not. The game is great for a certain type of people. These are the patient types that enjoy being outsmarted by a piece of software. I am kind-of in this group, and I kind of liked it. It is not good for the twitching xbox gamer who can't go more than a femtosecond without teabagging (in a game, it would be incredibly humorous elsewhere) or killing someone. So if you enjoy energy drinks named after some predator's urine, don't play it.",

It has you using a gun that removes or deposits blocks in various ways to affect switches, build bridges, and move yourself around. This second part is markedly less awe inspiring after the first half, but its still a very fun and competant puzzle game.   Big shout out to the subtle and ambient audio in the game.

If you love puzzles and like a steadily growing difficulty level, this is definitely for you.  In Antichamber, you start out with basically yourself and a goal to 'finish the game' -- whatever that means. Slowly, you will come to understand the puzzling world around you and how and why certain things work the way they do. At some point, you will find a gun that helps you in various spots on your way. Even as you accumulate more and more powers, the game never gets old, always keeps you on your toes.  The ending is also very promising, so you won't find yourself accidentally finishing the game and then ask 'That's it?!'

The game is specifically designed to get you out of your comfort zone. While not aesthetically appealing, it doesn't need to be visually stunning to stun you. While it has traditional puzzles, like jumping on platforms that sink under your weight to make you go higher, to more obscure puzzles, like going through a door backwards because every time you look at the door it closes. Here is an example **SPOILER ALERT**  You approach two staircases, one going up and one going down. If you chose the up staircase, it returns you to the staircase. If you chose the down staircase, the same thing happens, but if you go back the way you came there's a new path.  These kinds of puzzles gave me headahces on end, and had to stop playing the games. Later on you get a type of gun that shoots blocks. You use these block to open doors, solve puzzles, and if you run through certain areas you lose any blocks you're carrying (emancipation grid anyone?) Anyway, Antichamber will change how you problem solve and go about doing things differently, the apex of psychological puzzles. Sometimes you'll find pictures on the walls. These pictures can be toggled to show a sentence or two, teaching valuable life lessons. I like that much, and have made many friends following those lines.  Pros: Interesting gameplay life lessons abstract puzzles  Cons: Can give certain people migranes confusing puzzles  Verdict: 7/10 Antichamber i would highly recommend if you like abnormal puzzle, but this is nothing like the momentum based puzzles of Portal. You could sit in a room for an hour and not figure out the puzzle. If you like to take a trip that tests you sanity, then Antichamber might be a good buy. ",

Otherwise the games are complete opposites, and yet both still work beautifully.  Portal = Fleshed out story; Antichamber = No story provided at all (you make your own guesses on what's going on) Portal = Humorous characters and script; Antichamber = No talking or other characters (you are completely alone) Portal = The game provides direction on where to go or what to do; Antichamber = You get no help. Explore and figure it out yourself. Both games = You get a nifty 'gun' to help you  Like Portal, Antichamber ends up being a fairly short game (the gameplay is mainly from exploration and trying to figure out what to do), but if you enjoyed Portal and can get Antichamber for a good deal, then I definitely recommend picking it up.",

However, this is also my biggest issue with it: because there isn't a story and we're simply working towards an ending, there really isn't anything substanial to gain from playing it. The puzzles only serve to proceed you closer to finishing the game and acquiring new wisdoms, which aren't really wonderful just by the fact they are, in total, generic and plentiful.

Turning around will give you an entirely new room to explore, and the puzzles range from simple to extremely challenging. The only issue with the game is it's lack of settings. Changing resolution is only for people who's monitor is a different size, and does not affect graphic quality. While it isnt a graphic heavy game, I dont suggest running it on a socialite computer (one which is outfitted for facebook and youtube, or otherwise windows 8).

            "review_text": "Anti-Chamber is a game hard to discuss with someone unless they have played through it, making it challenging to review without ruining certain aspects. The game is developed by a single indie developer from Australia named Alexander Bruce and this is his first formal released game. AntiChamber is a bizarre experience that not only challenges the way you think but pits traditional thinking patterns against you, where walls may not exist depending on how you look at them, and stairs can bring you to the same place no matter which direction you take. AntiChamber will keep you questioning yourself the whole way through. Although it is purely single-player, AntiChamber does not have a conventional story; the game is what you make of it. The hints for puzzles double as philosophical messages as you continue to navigate through the strange halls of the cold sterile environment.   When you launch the game you are immediately thrown into the world of Anti-Chamber, where conventional video game logic is made useless. There is no “Main Menu”; instead the box that you start in serves as your menu. You can change the resolution and mouse sensitivity by looking at and clicking the various buttons, but this box also serves as your main hub for the rest of the game. From this hub you are able to instantly teleport to any puzzle that you have encountered so far, and because Anti-Chamber is a very non-linear experience you will be free to go to any place you want, and if you have the wit you can even complete some puzzles without the necessary tools.   There are a variety of different puzzles in Anti-Chamber but the majority of them require the use of a matter manipulating gun. Initially the gun allows you to pick up blocks and place them down but as you progress you will be able to upgrade to manipulate the blocks in different ways to help solve more complex puzzles. Throughout the game there are vague illustrations with text on the walls that act as hints and as you view them the picture gets saved in the main hub for your viewing later. Early on in the game I found it difficult to distinguish which puzzles I was actually capable of solving but as the game hinted “failure to succeed does not mean failure to progress”. If there is a puzzle that you have no idea how to do, it is best to just leave it and try a different one as the other puzzles may teach you new tricks.   The world of Antichamber looks simple and phenomenal at the same time which compliments the game from both an aesthetic point of view and also a design approach, as it helps when faced with the most difficult puzzles to understand the environment. From the sterile white to the vibrant green, blue and red, the game has an artistic style that is simple yet very effective. It is a welcomed departure from games that give you a visual overload like Crysis 3. This is not to say that Antichamber is a bad looking game; the colours and interesting environments gave me more “Wow!” moments than other big titles such as Crysis or Battlefield. However, it could use a little anti-aliasing to smooth out the edges. Even though it’s using Unreal Engine 3, the game is not very demanding performance wise. The only downside is that you can’t tinker with the options menu and are forced to use the WASD control scheme (but if you want you can change this in the config files).  The music and sounds of Antichamber compliment its vibrant, sterile atmosphere with chilling calm tones. It has quite the relaxing effect as you wander the halls trying to solve different puzzles. The music is done by Siddhartha Barnhoorn and has an interesting and unique sound that really sets the tone of the game. Here is a brief sample of some of the music from Antichamber.

The puzzles are divine and the steady inclusion of increasingly-versatile matter guns keep the challenges and dynamics fresh  For the most part, the balance is struck just right: That frustrating mind-ache as you get completely stumped, followed by that invigorating moment when you finally crack it. There's no tutorial, which creates a nice quirk where you're forced to explore, look around and touch things - doing God-knows-what to try to make sense of what is and isn't possible.

It took me 8 hours, largely from exploration and dinking around, to complete all but one of the available 'room tiles' (I'm not going to look through walkthroughs to figure out which one I missed) as well as complete the minimal story.  The game plays with your mind a lot in the beginning, but eventually you become accustomed to what it is doing. As I played, I looked at everything from a programmer's perspective, thinking about how each alternate view, turn around shift, and whatnot had to be coded for. It was almost as intriguing to me to try to think about how I would code these things as it was figuring out the puzzles in the game. This is the first... ~1/4 to 1/3 of the game, and it was fascinating. If the entire game was 8 hours of this sort of trickery, I would have rated this as one of my absolute favorite games. It's still a great game, but...  ... things changed once I got the first 'block gun'. It lets you pick up and drop little blocks. The game changed, mostly, from a mind bender to a mess-with-blocks game. This was a lot less interesting to me personally. Especially since there are various upgrades to the guns which make some puzzles easier (WAY WAY easier in some cases). It was more interesting trying to get through puzzles I knew I was supposed to do later well before I was ready. I even solved a few that were obvious 'get to know your new upgrade' levels before I got those upgrades, just through sheer determination and dinking around with single floating boxes (gets you around a few places, but so hard to do right). Others just thwarted me for a long time (looking at you, darned WTF floorless chamber) and when you get the right upgrade (able to fill in spaces in this case), it's obvious what to do. In any case, though not as strong as the beginning, this was still fun.  Still, all in all, I would give this game an 8/10 for the complete experience and I definitely recommend it for any other puzzle lovers.",

I give the game a 9/10. I'd give it a straight-up 10 if there was a way to like.. turn it down. Like, if I went to the Options Menu, graphics section (not even in the Advanced Controls subsection, just graphics section) and found a slider for Vividness (by default it's on 10/10), I'd want to turn that down to about 2 or 3 out of 10. If I could do that, I'd have kept the game. But I refunded it. It gave me massive headaches, induced actual physical nausea.. the colors and the camera, it just killed me.

The real beauty of the puzzles in Antichamber is it's hard to even understand there's a puzzle here, let alone what to do about it. It's more like exploring your brain in a dream than a straight up and down puzzle game. While it does have lots of moments that are more mechanical, mostly it's about changing the very way your mind is perceiving this problem. Often it wasn't a problem at all. The problem was in your brain, not the game.  It's like being trapped in a dream. It's amazing. I'm making it sound like there's no logic to it, that everything is random. But the masterpiece of it is when you realise that all the crazy stuff going on that makes zero sense, and surely can't be happening, suddenly does make sense. The entire game is like that. It challenges the very way your brain works.  The developers must be the kind of people that can solve an entire room of rubix cubes just by squinting their eyes at them for a second. ",

With that said, if you wish to be challenged in some new and different ways, this game's worth every penny.  Before you play though, I'd make a few suggestions:  Take everything you  think  you know about puzzle games and  throw it out the window.    Don't look up the solutions - if you find yourself stuck or unsure where to go next, walk away (in game or otherwise) and come back later. Sometimes you'll notice things (or places) you didn't before.   No matter how absurd or irrelevant something might seem, don't be afraid to try it - no death/no foul   Sometimes it helps to   take a suggestion straight out of Hansel and Gretel   to see how your world truly is   Do not be disuaded by the 'simplistic' graphics on this game - it has just what it needs. The basic views with color in just the right places actually add to the atmosphere and let you concentrate on the best part ~ the puzzles!

You may hit a dead end, but that is an acceptable result. You are even rewarded for hitting the dead end with some words of encouragement. Then you can just go back and try something different. No worries. There is absolutely no pressure to complete puzzles in time. You are free to take everything at your own pace.

Antichamber probably gets a lot of comparisons to Portal, and for good reason. Both are puzzle games who rely on novel elements of level design and the ability to manipulate the environment to create what could be seen as a larger puzzle as a whole.  However, Antichamber, focuses entirely on the latter. There is no antagonist, no threat of danger. The worst thing that may happen is you accidently boxing yourself in somewhere, and even that is an incredibly minor inconvenience due to your ability to return to any room you have visited from the main menu, which seconds as a sort of universal hub room.  Also unique to this game is its sense of exploration. Antichamber is the best example I can think of as a puzzle-focused first-person Metroidvania-style game, where your only limitation in exploration are which tools you have collected. Oftentimes you will find yourself delightfully lost, as you rush forward only to find yourself back where you began. Antichamber is not about completing the labyrinth, it's about exploring it. Also, there's no David Bowie, pretty fantasy settings, or quirky puppets. But the ability to manipulate reality is a nice consolation prize.",

            "review_text": "Not sure what the hubbub is about. For all the hyperbole about 'OOOH IT'S SO MINDBENDING', Antichamber is actually pretty straightforward, and quite frankly, dull.   Early on, the game has nothing to offer but a handful of obvious tricks, which you'll see through immediately. At one point the game recreates the Lost Woods from Ocarina of Time (NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRY GUYZ). I'm not sure why a puzzle game with absolutely no consistency is a good idea, because it ultimately boils down to futzing around until something new happens. I was expecting some kind of puzzle game where the laws of physics/reality are altered in some way, but Antichamber is really a set of disjointed illusions for the first hour, until you get the BLOCK GUN.  Upon finding the block gun, the 'mindbending' aspects of the game vanish entirely and lead to an endless series of boring block puzzles. There's really nothing particularly clever, challenging, or interesting going on here. Some of the early block puzzles are alright, but it quickly gets out of hand. One 'puzzle' literally has you soaking up zillions of blocks to build a giant staircase like some boring version of minecraft. It's just tedium.  Most of this is just mediocre, but Antichamber really becomes offensive when all the frustrating parts become apparent. The dangers of having a game centered on changing the rules and warping reality jump out at you when you realize you're missing crucial information. Here we have a game that challenges you to 'accomplish the impossible', and ironically it's impossible to tell what IS possible. You'll spend 10 minutes on one puzzle only to discover that some puzzles are literally unsolvable without some new gadget. I get that the game is meant to be exploratory and somewhat confusing, but some things are explained upfront, and other things are never made clear.  There's very little consistency to the puzzle design. When a game's design depends on unintuitive logic, the challenge usually comes from discovery: observing cause-and-effect relationships so that you can extrapolate the mechanics. Antichamber fails because the puzzles are solved upon the first observation, and since there's no consistent puzzle design, the player just stumbles along without having learned anything. Unfortunately, the lack of direction is compounded by the winding and open-ended nature of the level design. There's really no obvious path to follow, so you spend a lot of time hitting dead-ends, never knowing whether you're missing something, too thick to figure out the solution, or need some new ability.  And the levels branch a LOT as you move along, especially early on when you're exploring everything for the first time. Things tend to close off behind you, so after you pass by a dozen points-of-interest/corridors, your mental 'come-back-to-this' list is overloaded. It doesn't help that Antichamber is visually quite bland. Yes, the screenshots on the store page make it look very cool, as if the game were built in Matlab, but 90% of it consists of blank, white, square corridors. Rare splashes of color don't add much and don't distinguish different areas. Every door is identical. Wandering around and backtracking become doubly irritating when the 'map' is inconsistent, sometimes showing you places you should explore, but not always. Thus you'll spend a lot of time aimlessly wandering around trying to figure out where to go next.  The irritations don't stop there. Traveling around almost always requires you to re-solve the same annoying puzzles again and again, many of which use the equally annoying block gun. Even worse, Antichamber has an irritating habit of warping you to some other part of the game without warning, often forcing you to teleport again to an earlier area and re-solve the same boring puzzles once more. Again, I get that the game is supposed to be confusing, but there comes a point where it's no longer for the sake of challenge.  On top of it all, there's really no ultimate goal or progression. There's no plot or any real sense of place. For a standard puzzle game, I normally wouldn't complain, but Antichamber is definitely reaching for something more. There's some real effort put into the sound design. The ambiance mostly involves odd nature soundscapes; sometimes it works but generally feels out-of-place for a game that is otherwise totally abstract. The game also loves to bask in its own stupidity with truly awful morsels of wisdom it feeds you constantly. In many ways, Antichamber feels like it's aiming for Portal a bit too much, including some blatant puzzle mechanics lifted directly.  In the end, I really can't recommend Antichamber. I think some folks are too easily impressed by a few, admittedly unusual, cheap tricks. Just play Portal. Or The Stanley Parable. Or Echochrome. Or anything else, really.",

Antichamber is a bit like Portal without any actual portals. You're lost in a maze filled with pretentious and artsy puzzles. 'What is this place? Do I have to go up to get down? What's the point? Who knows? Float like a brick, man.'   My ultimate motive for finding my way out was to escape the ugly graphics.",

            "review_text": "Everyone rants about this game, and I decided to give it a go. At the time of this review, I'm very near the end (I think).  Unfortunately, Antichamber failed to impress me. The environment looks unfinished, the philosophical hindsight wall panels are boringly cliche and the game has no story and almost zero ambience. The only interesting things about the environment are the 'Three Paths in Sight' museum room (which had some creatures I hoped I might encounter) and that black Macguffin block that's always floating out of sight and whispering.   The audio was just confusing in places. What's with all the sounds of nature? Most of the time, it seems to serve no purpose.   This game is supposed to 'mess with my head', which it did for about two minutes. The non-Euclidean geometry that Antichamber employs would probably have been a lot more effective at messing with me if there was any narrative at all to hook me in. But there isn't, so it isn't very impressive. Once you realize that this is all possible because it's a computer game and can have all the wacky spatial physics that it wants, it sort of takes the fun away. To make up for the lack of plot, I imagined that this game is like a benign version of the movie Cube; where you can't die, and if you just persevere, you will eventually complete it. And there are a lot of cubes.   That being said, Antichamber does have some redeeming features. Being able to try any chamber from the start of the game saves you the endless frustration of having to go back through all the other puzzles should you get stuck or fail a section. The game relies quite a bit on a 'learn as you go' approach, which I appreciate, and the help tools were limited, forcing the player to work out the 'Cube Gun' and the different color cube functions on their own. Some of the puzzles were actually quite fun to solve.   One of the problems with puzzle games is that they have little replay value. However, you may want to play them as a quick run-through for nostalgia's sake (Portal series). But for that to happen, the game has to provide you with some desire to play it. As I went further and further into Antichamber and realized that there was no story at all, it robbed me of my motivation and turned the game into just something to complete, which is a disappointment. I feel like it could have been more, but it seems more like a beta build than a finished game that sells for twenty dollars. I'm glad I bought it on sale, because if I had bought it full price, I would be ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Likely as not, I'll uninstall Antichamber once I've completed it and not play it again.   Imagine Portal 2 without GLADOS, Wheatley, Cave Johnson, physics gel, Aerial Faith Plates, cake and only six colors. You've just played Antichamber, and I've just saved you twenty dollars.",

But before long I realized that the game was just trolling me. There are no real hints or clues for the majority of puzzles, and the rules the game establishes for one puzzle are immediately abandoned for the next.  In the end most of the puzzles require a kind of clever, brute force, trial and error. There is never a point where it clicks and you go 'aha!' for any of the puzzles. In fact, if you feel an 'aha!' moment, the game has probably just tricked you into over thinking it. That is the exact opposite of what I want in a surealist puzzle game.",

Most of the puzzles involve jumps that have to be done at the right split second, chain reactions that may or may not actually work, and clicking the left mouse button over and over again to replace blocks after said botched jumps and chain reactions.  If you want a fun but difficult puzzle experience, try Portal or Myst. Don't play this game unless you got it with the newest Humble Bundle AND enjoy having Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.",

Antichamber: Puzzles! Me: Nice, that's what I was looking for. So what's this first one? AC: Staircases! Me: Okay, I see that. Let's see what happens if I go up this staircase...Surprise, I'm back where I started, interesting. It looks like the same thing happens if I go down. So what do I do now, Antichamber? AC: Look! I made a sign for you! It has stick figures on it! Me: Thanks, that should help, then. Let's see, 'The choice doesn't matter if the outcome is the same?' Thanks, Antichamber, that's pretty obvious already. AC: Hahahaha! I tricked you. Me: Great, well, I'm going backwards, aaaand, hey I'm somewhere else. AC: I knew you were going to do that! Me: So I gathered. How clever of you.  --A couple of minutes later--  Me: Hey, it looks like this is a dead end. Antichamber, what am I- Whoa, the floor disappeared on me. That would be a surprise if you hadn't done that in the previous room. AC: Hahahaha! I tricked you! I'm so smart. Me: Well, since I'm down here, I might as well read this sign. Let's see, 'Life has a way of pushing us in the right direction?' Fascinating. Did you come up with that all by yourself? AC: Yesss! I'm so smart! Me: Cute.  --Later still--  AC: I got you a little gun thingy that shoots blocks where you want them! Me: Ooooh, a new mechanic, nice. Let's try this out. AC: See, you can use it to close switches and hold doors open! Me: That would make sense. Okay, so I guess I go through these beams to open these doors? Okay, seems pretty strightforward. What do I need to do in this next room? It looks like there are ten switches I need to close here. AC: Ha! You don't have enough blocks! You need to go back and get more. See! I tricked you! Me: And the door closed behind me so I can't go back.  AC: Haha, you're stuck in here! Me: So what do I do then, Antichamber? AC: Restart the game! Me: Wait, what? Oh, I can go back to any area I've gone to on the map. Hey, Antichamber, this map doesn't make any sense, nothing lines up. AC: That's because they don't have to! Me: Then it doesn't seem to be a map. Oh, at least the map shows me where I'm going if I look at it. Okay, I'll go back to pick up some more blocks- Wait, I don't have any so I can't go anywhere. Antichamber, where are all the blocks? AC: You need to start from the right place so you have enough blocks! Me: So why let me start here? AC: Uhhhhh....I tricked you! Me: Great.  --A short while later--  Me: It looks like I'm stuck again, Antichamber, I think I'll reset. AC: Okay! Hey, look your timer ran out! Me: Timer? What? Oh, you mean the thing that says 'Live life by your own watch' above it? Why put it there then? AC: Because it's smart! It makes you smarter! Me: Thanks, Antichamber, I figured that out a long time ago.  Ten minutes later I left my job working in a day care for 'indie' games.   Antichamber likes to think it's smart, and, at the beginning, it is, the puzzles are actually pretty clever. However, as the game continues, the fact that it likes to throw something completely unrelated to the previous puzzles at you while smugly preaching at you via meaningless and pretentious 'life lessons' on signs, it starts to grate, and badly. Antichamber doesn't have any ground rules, it can throw whatever it wants at you, and rather than being interesting, it just becomes annoying because of just how badly the game conveys progression; every puzzle starts the same and they eventually merge into a seamless blob of white hallways where none of the choices you make affect your environment. As I illustrated above, it is the game equivalent of arguing with a small child, one who thinks he's smarter than you. Games are supposed to have rules, of what you can and cannot do, and what the game can and cannot do. Antichamber, on the other hand, can do whatever it wants, while your rules stay the same. In a debate, this is known as 'moving the goalposts' and it is an extremely cheap method of getting your opponent to keep arguing, and in a game it is a cheap and annoying tactic of trying to keep the game feeling fresh.  This is not a game intended for people who liked Portal. Portal had rules of what both you and the game can and cannot do with portals, while Antichamber does whatever it wants and laughts because you were foolish enough to assume that it would follow some kind of 'thread.'",
