Somewhat interesting story (what little there is) 4. Great atmosphere  Cons: 1. The graphic design could use an update and improvements. 2. Action was tedious and monotenous. 3. Dialogue needs proof-read. 4. The storyline could use some beefing-up 5. Overall length could easily be increased  This game has potential. It needs multiple improvements. With the idea behind the game, art style, and atmosphere it has a great start. It just needs some extra love to push it to excellence.",

            "review_text": "Top-down horror/survival game. It starts out vague and boring, but as it progresses there's some pick-up to the plot. It's interesting that they added a variety of enemies to the game. I played it through during the 'key error' phase where you couldn't access it through steam, so my time playing it wasn't recorded. It's about 3-5 hours, give or take. A map would've been a nice addition because Motte Island is fairly large, and can be fairly confusing if you can't recall where to go or if you have a hard time finding your way around in games. One of the things that really got to me was dialogue, the game caught my eye because of it's artistic detail, I expected it to be well-rounded, but the dialogue didn't provide that. A game like this should be rich in dialogue I believe, it shouldn't solely depend on it's other elements. I'm not saying it's a bad game, but the dialogue really didn't make me enjoy the entire experience the game had to offer. I enjoyed some of the other elements brought into it though, they could prove to be really fun at times. I'd recommend it if it were on sale.",
