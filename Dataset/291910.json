The driving handling is weird, equipment is cool, vehicles look nice, Ive put real time reflection on high in settings because calls come in too quick and u dont have time to maintain ur truck, so put it on high its more realistic.",

If so NEVER play this game, I pick at these games as i have actual experience so i'll admit i am sometimes bias with these games as i know what can and can't be done in real life but let me tell you this and im not exagerating........ it'll leave such a bad taste in your mouth you'll need to wash it out everyday for the rest of your life! If you want to play a good Firefighting Simulator Go Spend your money on a Airport Firefighter Simulator(or Airport Firefighter Simulator 2013 both are great) or even better pre-order  Notruf 112 - Die Feuerwehr Simulation( Emergency Call 112 ) Don't worry English and German :) but spend your money on one of these and not this, you'll tank me!  Pros: Not much  Cons: Bugs, No Patches, plus another 100 that i won't write about",

Why on earth would you publicise a game that is of so poor quality and functionality, ruin you reputation.  Pros: Good for 5 mins ... I played 60 just to see if it would get better.  Cons: Graphics...err, what graphics, maybe back in the 90s but certainly not what you would expect today, and there's no improvement when you set everything to high.  Sounds: arrrrghhhh, door opening and closing all the time, inane chatter so repettitive, I'd lost the will to live. Vehicles all sound like a 1950s Polish tractor.... and I mean ALL vehicles.  Gameplay: Not bad, I put out the dumpster fire, the BBQ pit fire and I took a drunk person to hospital, I then went to the nearest river and threw myself in.  Any chance of my money back ?",

Fires don't always go out, and if you post on the forums, their idiotic moderator does a terrible job and blames your machie. The developers for this game did what alldevs do anymore - 'finish' a game, ship it, and move on. There's been no updates, nothing. In order to play free mode, you must complete the story, which is impossible when you encounter the fires not getting put out multiple times.",

            "review_text": "So just bought this game...  How do I start this, from the crew in the station (NPC's) saying hello 100000 times when you go near the station, then you think you get away from that when you enter a unit to go out on a call and the NPC beside you keeps repeating and repeating what they are saying the whole time.   Then I go and mistakenly pick up breathing apparatus in the station, went back and spammed E trying to get it out of my hands again because I wasn't allow back into the unit to go out on a fire, so obviously I then failed my shift and had to restart it all over again.  Next thing, at night time you would think the NPC cars on the road would turn on their lights.. yes? .. well no, because they are all wearing night vision seemly.  I paid £14.99 today for this and I've made a ticket to Steam based on the fact that this Simulator/Game shouldn't even be considered in BETA nevermind a proper game.. it's Alpha at its best and even at that it's a very very early version.   I could go on and on, the physics of the fire engines.. I mean doing 120 KMH around corners? one steady engine noise so no sound of acceleration, the water looks like a white smoke.. my god I could keep listing, if you happen to read these forums before buying.. save the money and spend it on a carton fire game, you will get better details and a less bugged game for the money.   It's a disgrace that Steam have this for sale. I'm praying for a miracle and perhaps if it's granted I will get a refund, I mean this really really is a huge disgrace.   Stay away from this game, don't make the same mistakes. 3/10 and that's being honest and very generous.",
