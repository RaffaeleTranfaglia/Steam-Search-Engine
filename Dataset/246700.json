            "review_text": "If you've seen the store page's trailer, then Strike Vector is as fun as it looks. Be warned, beta is beta. Servers crash frequently, and there are frequent glitches with the menus. For instance, after being boot out of a game due to a crashed server, you must restart it to play again. But all that aside... THE GAMEPLAY IS AMAZING. It plays like a dream! The ability to swap between Jet and Harrier modes on the fly is an incredible boon, and it makes dogfights fast-paced and intense, and extremely enjoyable. You have two weapon slots, and there are about a half dozen weapons to choose from, and you get to mix and match as you want. Each weapon has two slots for perks, as well. Two weapons, two perks each, and a ship perk, and a special ability, all creates excellent diversity, and it should cater to anyone's playstyle. Did I mention you have 3 loadout slots so you can save several of these combinations that you can swap from every time you die? You can even change them before you jump back in. Visually, it's impressive. There's not much that stands out, but I love the machinery/factory look of all the menus and screens. One minor gripe I have is that certain menu prompts are unclear. They don't stand out very much and it's easy to skip over them because they're so small. For instance, at first I didn't even realize you were able to fly on the maps solo, because the button to do that was buried in the tutorial section, and was a very, very small button along the top of the screen. The ships themselves are customizable visually, and have patterns and a full color spectrum to choose from for each main section of your ship. There's a bit of texture pop-in, and some things look a little bit muddy, and it's obvious to see a lot of stand-in art and text in places, but overall it's not bad. Sound overall is decent. The weapons and flight sound great, very meaty where it counts. Explosions are visceral, too. Though I would love a little more feedback in some places, such as when switching between flight and harrier mode. There were some times while in a match where I was off to the side, menus open adjusting options, and the game was silent. I think it could stand to have a little more realism in its sound. Basically I mean that it should echo more; I should hear the fights going on all across the map. I don't believe there should ever be silence in a game like this. Music! There's no in-game music, and if there is, it was brief, and I didn't notice it. The title theme is pretty cool, however the menus afterward... it's monotonous and could stand to be changed or improved. I don't like it much. So aside from minor complaints, it's great where it counts! I could see myself playing this very much, spending a lot of my extra time here. I await the ability to host my own games in-client, or to be able to play offline against AI or over LAN, but such features do not yet exist. I'm glad I'm at least able to fly around the maps on my own without needing to connect. There's not much to do save practice flying around and shooting at nothing, but it's a nice add-in. With a plethora of unlockables, including ship parts and decals and patterns, and stuff for my pilot's profile, plus the simple matter that it's so damn fun to play, there's plenty of reason to come back to it again and again. To conclude, it's fast paced, it's exciting, it's fun as hell. Lots to choose from, fun to play, lots of potential. Beta is beta, though. Gameplay gets a solid 9/10, Aesthetic and design and visuals gets an 8/10, sound gets a 6/10, lasting appeal/replay value: I-will-be-losing-so000oooOOOOoo-many-hours-to-this-beastie/10 Overall, in its current beta state: 7.5/10, with a BADASS SEAL OF APPROVAL!",

            "review_text": "When I saw the open beta trailer for Strike Vector back in early January I didn't think much of it other than it had some great music, after receiving a gift copy my opinion completely changed. Strike Vector is hands down one of the fastest shooters out there with unsurpassed freedom of movement and speed. It requires some practice to get down but it's an absolute blast once you do. Customization is handled wonderfully, with players having access to everything non-cosmetic from the beginning and acquiring cosmetic parts, paintjobs, and decals as they level up. As someone who doesn't care for progression all that much I think they've found a good balance. The maps are great too, with each one being rated on how deadly they are to traverse. Anyone can go fast, but weaving through the innards of an airborne oil refinery at full afterburn isn't something just anyone can do. There are only two complaints I have, the size of the community and the lack of lag compensation. Lack of lag compensation wouldn't be so bad if I wasn't confined to playing on a european server half the time, but that's just the thing, at best I've seen two and a half servers worth of people playing. Personally, Strike Vector is probably one of the best shooters I've played. It'd make any other fast paced competitive shooter look like a snoozefest but I have a hard time recommending it because without other players there really isn't much you can do. If you've got some friends get the four-pack, at least you'll all be able to enjoy it together.    oh and the music is ♥♥♥♥ing great.       ",

            "review_text": "A current trend in the gaming industry, both AAA and otherwise - is to make games try and appeal and be accessible to as large an audience as possible, partly to secure profit margins and partly under the misguided notion that the broader a game's sphere of influence, the better the game is. Strike Vector is in short, a large triumphant middle finger to that notion. Strike Vector is a niche shooter and is bloody well proud of it. Existing in the 6DoF subgenre, it is a brutally-demanding multiplayer arena shooter that subscribes to old school PC gaming multiplayer-standards as opposed to the matchmaking and progression systems of current games. All weapons and other loadout modifications are unlocked straight away, and there is only a straightforward server browser, meaning that anyone can play against anyone else, regardless of their skill level.  This coupled with the sky-high skill floor of Strike Vector are the main two aspects that make most people refuse to give this game a chance. New players tend to get their asses handed to them very quickly, and only those dedicated enough to put up with the harsh first few hours of play will get any considerable enjoyment from the game; however, those who do manage to ascend the skill floor will find themselves playing an extremely fast, fluid and visceral shooter with a great variety of loadouts, maps, gametypes and veteran players to play against. The matter of fact is that even though detractors claim that this game is dead, it really is not if you are willing to look. There is a small but dedicated community willing to keep this game alive and kicking despite all odds (at least on saturdays).  One of the reasons why this game is so great is because of what I can only describe as 'game feel'. The speed certainly contributes to this but it is other factors such as great sound design, visceral gunplay and the fact that the player's ship is relatively small, meaning that you can manuever through almost any gaps in the maps, resulting in some great high-speed chases. The movement is made just as fun as the shooting because of this, and it is the main reason why in my opinion, this game trumps similar games such as Strike Suit Zero, where the player's hitboxes just feel way too big relative to the geometry you should be able to manuever through.  This is just the tip of the iceberg too, there are so many little nuances to each of the weapons that even I, who has played 100 hours feel like I still have a LOT to learn and uncover, and I still haven't tried a lot of the available loadouts and playstyles.   These nuances are not perfect though, it does have to be mentioned that Strike Vector is a flawed game in spite of all of its strengths. First and foremost, the server population is indeed low. It seems unfair to blame this on the game, but regardless it is something that can greatly detract from the enjoyment of the game, especially if you are a newer player. Secondly, the weapon balance is not exactly perfect. Most weapons are situational, and are better on some maps than others, but there are certain almost-gamebreaking combinations that can kill the flow of the gameplay, such as dual gatlings with the firerate and range perks, the area of engagement is just too large compared to more situational weapons such as the LMG and swarm missiles. Finally, there is no real means of new players to train for the onslaught they will receive in multiplayer. The in-game tutorial is very rudimentary, and the only single player modes are free flight through the maps on your own, or a few time trials mostly involving shooting near-stationary targets and flying through rings. These can train your movement and accuracy to an extent but not nearly as much as bot matches would, which could also be fun for both newcomers and veterans with the right difficulty configurations. All in all, the shortcomings are clearly prevalent but are not enough to ruin the fundamental fun and good-design at the core of the game's mechanics.  Despite what you've likely been told, it is okay for games to target a niche, instead of going for mass-market appeal and Strike Vector shows that sometimes some of the best games can be made by adopting this attitude. It is true that the game is lacking in server population, and if you are at all interested in this game, you will have to prepare to receive a lot of asskickings and do a lot of reading to have fun, but if you do partake in this, it will almost be certainly worth it when you are able to play alongside veteran players.",

But it's incredibly hard, like really hard for some, and impossible for many because of it's MASSIVE learning curve. And that is what makes the game interesting for some people but it leaves some people at an increadible disadvantage. This makes rounds unballanced and annyoying even infuriating for new players.  So beyond that learning curve SV becomes a thing of beauty and innovation making rounds feel like a true challenge when up against the right players. And well ballenced wepons and skills add to that (except swarm and homming missles just don't). AND THE SKILL OF YOUR FLYING IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AS WELL AS YOU SKILL AT KILLING PEOPLE these are eaqual (that just makes me happy personaly) So I as an experianced player give this game a 8/10 but that might change with beacuse the devs are making the experiance for new player a little better each time update.",

Despite that love, I will give it a fair review:  Strike Vector lacks polish in a lot of ways and it excels only in it's multi-player gameplay. It's hard to get into. There's no adequate tutorial, the single player is uninteresting, you simply die a lot when you play multiplayer--mostly because there's only ever one server to play on due to the small community. After about a month and 50+ hours of playing, it seems like a solid small community but it leaves a difficult gap to cross for those with no experience to those with a lot. I don't expect a lot of these issues to be fixed either. So, here's what you do get: In, my opinion, the best aerial combat simulator ever. The numbe of situations you run into are always fun and engaging. You could be chasing someone whose takn your flag at breakneck speeds through logic defying industrial cityscapes at one moment and in a 3 on 3 dogfight in the skies at another. You will crash a lot and probably never stop crashing a lot but, to me, it's almost always hilarious. There's a lot of fun to be had.  Unfortunately, the community is so small. It's really why I'm writing this, so that hopefully some people will find what myself and a few others love so much. As it stands, it's hard to get into because you get simply slaughtered by veterans. There's a newbie server but since there is only ever enough people to fill up one server at a time, everyone just goes there. Too bad a review isn't really publicity but at least I'm trying.

I honestly wasn't even frustrated when I got destroyed, I was just fascinated at the intense pace and feeling of speed in this game.  Single player mode is fun! Back in my day there wasn't a single player mode, but now it's easier than ever to practice your flying skills.  The good:  Fast pace. It feels the same as speedrunning Sonic Generations, a game into which I've dumped over 100 hours. Intense shooting mechanics. From chasing down enemies with gatlings to sniping a ship flying at the speed of sound with the plasma, the shooting will never get boring. Great community. As expected; the only people who play this game are those patient enough to learn it. It's like the learning curve of a MOBA, without the toxic community.  The bad:  There is very rarely more than one game active on the server. If there is an active game, it's probably in an EU server. It's not too bad since I'm in New York, but I'd like more games with sub-100 ping. Sometimes server lag causes you to crash your ship by teleporting into the stage geometry. It takes a long time to learn. 5 hours of dying to yourself before you learn to fly, followed by another 5 hours of dying to others before you learn to shoot and fly at the same time.  I wish more people would play this game. ♥♥♥♥'s amazing, 10/10 would (nogame)nolife.",

You can switch between two modes of flight by easily pressing one button. The two modes are Harrier where you hover in one spot and Jet where you fly super fast! You can have two weapons, right and left click. There are 8 different weapons. You can use two of the same weapon too! There are also Special weapons and Special Abilities! The game has very high quality graphics. Very well designed maps. And extremely fast-paced fun combat! There are plenty of different gamemodes, and you can customize your Vector. There are different parts, camos, and you can use ANY color! There is a leveling system which rewards you with Concept art, Thumbnails for your in-game profile, and parts for your vector! NONE of the parts actually change how good your vector is, they are just for decoration, so it isn't unfair. Personally, I'd recommend this game to anyone who likes first or third person shooter, and to anyone who likes fast-paced PvP. But to be honest, evryone should play this game. It is so unique and amzing. I'll see you in Airshot City! (Yes one of the maps is named Airshot City, lol)",

Good enough for me to buy the full game in a heartbeat  Anyways - it's good, no, scratch that, it's great. Seriously fast, fluid and intense - one minute being the hunter and then, with one wrong turn, one misfire, and you're suddenly the prey. Trust me guys (and gals?), this is really is a good as it looks. A great number of servers around, and the ability to jump into any game at any time, meaning there's no hanging around before you start dealing out the pain, or getting your **** handed back to you. You can change your loadout at any time, jump back into the game and see if it swings things in your favour. A really varied range of weapons - primary, secondary and special. You're going to be able to find the right set up for you to really be able to dish out the pain. The devs have put a serious amount of thought into this and it can cater to just about any player's preferences.  It plays really well on the keyboard, so there's no need for a special controller (pah!), and the keys are fully rebindable which is something you may have to do - as soon as the game starts, you want to have yourself in a nice'n'comfy position for a few hours of fun.   There's no campaign, and it's multiplayer only (at least at the moment), but there's an offline mode to practise your flying skills with - and trust me, you're going to want to do this. The craft you're piloting is a bit special, being able to do a 180 on a dime, great for planting a missile into the enemies craft, but you're gonna want to practise. I. Kid. You. Not. There's defintely a twitch factor here though that may put some people off. At the beginning you're going crash a lot into the beautiful scenery before something clicks, and you're flying between trusses, through channels and around corners whilst someone is chasing you.  So, to sum. Great game. Fluid. Easy to jump into for a quick round or 20. Visually stunning for what it does. Fun. Fun. Fun.  ",

The title draws influence from titles like Quake Arena and Unreal Tournament in both its presentation and content, but with air to air dogfights similar to Crimson Sky. Even with its roots heavily embedded into the old-school it still finds ways to offer a fresh experience while avoiding many of the pitfalls that befall similar titles.

The sound fades in and out constantly which makes the seemingly simple task of flying a disorienting, often nauseating experience. Ships are near-impossible to pilot. Instead of 'Strike Vector' they should've named it 'fiery crash simulator.' This might be due to the wonky control scheme that requires 14 fingers to work properly. As I am lacking the additional digits, my experience with this game has been mostly negative.  The levels all look like they were developed in 1999 by a novice graphic design student. The netcode is so bad that all gameplay is reduced to spray-and-pray or maining the OP weapons that just aren't fun to use. You want unlocks? You want progression? Well you might want to try your luck elswhere. Half of the 10 weapons (yes, only 10) available are useless. The crosshairs might as well not exist. What was that orange thing? Was that a targeting reticle? Why am I on fire? Oh, I died again.  Oh btw, thanks for keeping track of my score as it falls into the negative. That's the most rewarding gameplay mechanic I've seen in a long time. Thanks for that.  I'll state it again. Do not buy this game. You're better off getting DLC for a game that was released over 5 years ago. I'm serious. You will not enjoy this game. Also, no refunds. Like a shady electronics salesman, all sales are final. There is no trial period. You have to make a decision to purchase this game based on a couple of crappy trailiers slapped together by the development team using end-game content. I have no idea how long it would take to reach end-game content. I unlocked nothing in the short time I spent playing this game.",

Most deathmatch games I've played you can counter an opponents strategy with some other item or class or hiding strategy. There was none. I used mines, shields, and even the enemies shotgun strat but all to no avail. Got blinked behind over and over again and I could not turn fast enough to even look before dying.

The ability to stop flying instantly and change direction instantly kills any aspect of chasing someone through a cool map, if that's what you're here for, and the ability to start flying instantly and with an amazing turn rate kills any close combat twitch shooting.  Not to mention, the gamemodes are DM, TDM, CTF...it's hardly new and interesting. It's the same old boring modes except with ships. Where's the cool assault type maps? UT04 had this down with the one assault map where teams pilot ships in space and attack a base. Where's that in this game?  Then again, even if it was in, if you came for awesome flying ship fights you'll be disappointed and if you came for quake style fights in the air you'll also be disappointed. Game has amazing potential but doesn't capitalize. If you like flying fights play Freelancer and if you like twitch shooters play Quake, because this game unfortunately isn't as good as either and the inclusion of both modes in a mediocre way doesn't make up for the way in which they, individually, are mediocre in this game.  This ignores the whole 'grind for guns' part of the game, which is total crap.  I'd recommend if:  Remove ability to instantly switch from close range hover to long range flying mode (this kills quake style fights). Remove ability to instantly accelerate/deccelerate (this kills flying fights). Add an interesting game mode.",

Note: jack up the mouse controls because turning is slow as hell in MP combat I feel like haha. Combat is also a bit choppy and hopefully it will smooth out as time goes by. Watching my whole screen scramble isn't fun either, not sure if that is meant to be there from weapon fire or it is a scrambler type weapon add on haha. MP was frustrating: the controls felt a little delayed which made me think server support wasn't too high OR my computer just sucks... which is likely on my laptop. When you spawn, fading the screen is no fun because almost running into ♥♥♥♥ is just a terrible trick to play on new players. I can definitely see things becoming map based though or people just relying on the same setups because of ease to use.. homing missles and burst missles for one. also, defense + nanos almost seems op. keep track of where CD items are and run into trouble, if you are a decent pilot you can run and survive to heal and grab items. but, i've also noticed people crashing a lot and what i think may be on purpose to avoid giving out pts? I would be close to killing someone and either they get blown up by someone else or crash and thus wracking up points was a pain. Domination seems like it is the way to go in terms of starting off.

You're just thrown into a hangar area with a bunch of weapons and support equipment without any idea what each of them does and in which situations they come useful.

It blends the core elements of both these game types in a fast-paced Arena FPS environment (although you can play in third person as well). The levels are gorgeous and range from wide-open space-style dogfighting environments to the sort of claustrophobic passages and chambers that were commonplace in descent. You can get around both with level flight for dogfighting and instantly switch to a hover mode for face-to-face FPS-style dueling. There's even left/right strafing and powerups thrown in for the arena FPS junkies. The musical score for the title/configuration menus and sound effects is awesome as well. What's amazing about all of this is that it wasn't created by a large or even medium-size game studio. The game's website notes a total of eight people who worked on this game, yet it's extremely well-polished for what it is.  Of course, the game isn't flawless. There's a bit of a learning curve for flying mechanic of the game; it's simple, but you fly fast and need good reflexes (as you would in most FPS games) and you'll crash very frequently while trying to get the hang of it. However, the biggest problem by far is that virtually nobody is playing this game at the moment. It's a tragedy that the 8 people putting together this game didn't have a marketing budget to draw more people into it, but it is what it is.  If you love arena FPSes, do your part; try this game out and play it!",

This game feels very fast which is something I love, it definitely gives you a rush flying between obstacles avoiding gunfire and space debris at all times. The devs are constantly adding gamemodes and maps to boot.   The short story: buy this game. There are plenty of players to face off against, and you will not regret spending $6. It is an amazing game that will get you hooked the moment you get into the action.",

            "review_text": "Now this is a game that severely needs players' attentions.  Strike Vector is an extremely fun, fast-paced, multiplayer, action, dogfighting game between transforming aerial vehicles called Vectors. These Vectors have two modes, a Vector and a Harrier mode. While in Vector Mode, your vehicle's default mode, you can fly at extremely fast speeds allowing you to easily chase escaping targets or easily escape and outmaneuver an enemy if you so happen to be their target. While in Harrier Mode, your vehicle basically enters a hover mode allowing you to turn faster and aim easier. The downside with using the Harrier Mode is that while you can still strafe at a slow speed, you're basically a sitting duck, allowing other vectors to easily target you and take you down. Knowing when to switch modes is a key mechanic to master in this game in order to be successful; using Harrier Mode for example, while being chased, to quickly turn around and switch back to Vector Mode to try to outmaneuver your chaser is a pretty nifty trick to use once you get the hang of things.  Player progression doesn't come from unlocking stronger weapons or loadouts as you level up, as per standard by other games. Instead, all of the weapons and equipment are already given to the players at the very start of the game; the only things you unlock as you level up are different cosmetic items to change to appearance of your Vector, unlockable art, etc. This makes the game a lot more skill-based as opposed to level-based, a design philosophy which I highly applaud.  One may think that in order to play this properly, you're going to need a joystick. Well, to you I answer: Nope! Controlling your Vector is actually pretty easy and intuitive with the keyboard. There's your standard [W][A][S][D] keys for directions with [W] for forward/boost, [S] for backward/brakes, [A] for strafing left/rolling left and S for strafing/rolling right and transforming is done very easily with the [space] key. You move your camera around with your mouse and you also aim this way. You then shoot whichever weapons you have equipped with your left and right mouse buttons. That's it for the very basic controls and if you are somehow unhappy with the control scheme, don't worry; each key is rebindable.  Now, I've been going on about controls and mechanics but is the game actually fun? To put it simply, HELL YEAH! and very much so. I've mentioned before about the game's fast pace and from the very moment you try it out, I'm sure you will feel it too. The Vectors move very rapidly especially in Vector Mode and this may make flying a bit difficult to those who aren't used to it yet resulting in many crashes/suicides. Don't be discouraged however as once you start to get the hang of things, flying in this game will start to become one of the most satisfying things to do, be it making those sharp corner-turns or threading the needle multiple times. Now add to that flying, multiple other vectors each with the intent to kill each other, a variety of gorgeous looking maps, the variety of different weapons and equipment you can equip on your vector and you've got yourself one adrenaline-pumping, ridiculously fun, multiplayer dogfighting game.  I did mention at the very start of this review that this game needs attention. Why is that? Well, it's simply because unfortunately, not a lot of people play this game. Perhaps we can blame this to poor advertising or players simply being uninformed about this game's existence. Whatever the case, this is an extremely fun but overlooked game that clearly deserves more players than it currently does so play the game and help spread the word! :D",

            "review_text": "Let me first confirm all the noise about the Strike Vector community: It's dead. Which sucks. If it wasn't true at the time of the previous reviews, it sure is now.  That said, the game itself is a fantastically well-crafted dogfighting game, one which - as a game designer myself - I feel very much inspired by. The level of effort put into making this game what it is, can only be a result of great passion by the developers, which I can respect.  If only more of that effort had gone into advertising. Most of my friends have never heard of this game - even the flight sim addicts - and I only barely stumbled on it in during a sale. This is very sad, because this game deserves recognition.  The flight controls are very responsive, and switching into hover mode for a surprise kill is extremely satisfying. The levels are well-designed (and often claustrophobic, in a good way), and the visuals are stunning, especially for an indie title. The sound effects are intense, and the explosion you make when you pilot your crashing vessel right into an enemy ship feels like revenge done right. Top that off with a simple-but-effective loadout system (albeit with a few unbalanced combinations), and you have a very solid space-shooter that just feels right.  The main reason that I recommend this game (aside from the fantastic gameplay) is that the community is still salvageable on a smaller scale. It's on sale pretty often, so pick up a 4-pack or two, and get your friends in on it. The maps cap out at 16 for the most part, so turn it into a social thing with your gaming buddies.  Great game, unfortunate example of the importance of advertising. 8/10",

If you often playing space combat like Strike Suit series, X wing, and such. The controls should be pretty familiar for you  Tips: - Always go to your options and set down the GRAPHICS option, especially the Anti-alias. This should help you to get off graphic lags on 16p or 32p map - Harrier = hover mode, jet mode is... jet mode - Play with stable fast ping  I only wish this game has some kind of PvE or coop vs AI combat. Like taking down a boss ship or something like that.  Btw, get this game while it is discounted. The normal price tag is too expenssive imo.

I get on, see all the servers, and see three to six people playing at a given time. I enter a match and it's clear that only one person playing knows what they are doing. I have some choices here. Option 1, I fly about, have no idea how to get a lock on a target, shoot and miss forever with every weapon while my opponents dodge about (or not), they toy with me, then destroy me. Option 2, I crash while tryign to escape. Option3, just crash because HIGHSPEED CLOSE QUARTERS FRANTIC COMBAT! Option 4, I could love getting ♥♥♥♥♥ so much that I continue to get ♥♥♥♥♥ until I can hold my own in a dogfight. Option5, ragequit and go play something else.   I choose life! I choose OPTION5!  Edit: I am changing this to a recomendation. I must admit, the game is well crafted and a good looker. I believe the controls are tight, though difficult to learn. My main beef is that there is nothing for a more casual player to train with, like a campaign versus bots or something. But, for those who like this sort of gameplay, I think this would be great. It's a futuristic dogfight flight sim. All PVP, no story that I found. Boom.",

In my limited playtime I’ve encountered a few glitches, mostly terrain clipping. It’s pretty difficulty to distinguish what can stop you dead in your tracks and what is just window dressing.
