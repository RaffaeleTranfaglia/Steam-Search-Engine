Sorry I don't enjoy this.  Graphics are okay, soundtrack is not too irritating, but the gameplay is just meh.  You can find better.",

            "review_text": "Well, this game is bad. Really bad. First of all, as many already have stated, it's very hard. Usually you have to finish the level in less than 20 seconds, but still most of the levels can finished in two tries. Despite its challenging nature, the game can be finished in less than 90 minutes if you're not going to collect three stars on each level. But the main problem is misspelling of certaing words. For example, the 'scarecrow' is called 'fox', and the 'horns' (in multiple form) are called 'horn'. There are other examples, but I'm not too eager to play this game again. And to top it off, some items are invisible without a tip because they are hidden behind the game menu. Good luck trying to find them by yourself.",
