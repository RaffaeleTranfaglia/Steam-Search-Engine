            "review_text": "This is a really good game. Think Shining Force on the Genesis and you'll know what to expect.   The game is played on a 2 dimensional playfield. You control your characters during your turn, then the enemy controls all his characters during his turn. The game features various abilities that have different ranges, different weapon types, magic attacks, flying enemies, telepathic abilities that move objects and change the terrain, engineers that can build structures to change the battlefield, and environmental effects such as fire and water damage.   The graphics are the low point compared to more newer titles like the recent fire emblem games, but they suit the game and are just as good as those old 16 bit strategy games, which in my book were pretty good looking.   Something else I liked was the game features a skirmish mode that can be played with up to three players local coop with humans or CPU opponents. There are a bunch of maps to use.   Honestly, if you liked Shining Force or Fire Emblem, you'll enjoy this.",

While I wouldn't rank it as on par with those two, it is without a doubt a welcome addition to the SRPG genre that is extremely lacking on the PC platform.",

If you like fire emblem, shining force and games like that you will be at home here. As others have said the game can be tough but if you take time to examine the situations its manageable. i have some minor gripes with the game like the way saving is handled. it will autosave before each battle if you get stuck on one gettigng back to shop to restock yourself is a pain. most of the issues i had were actually with shops as the menus there dont respond when clicked on all the time and i havent found a way to sell items .   pros: deep gameplay and challenge, mod support, multiplayer (though i would have liked to see online support) cons: the way the game saves some shop issues",

            "review_text": "Sinister Design has done a great job recreating the feel of the Fire Emblem games on the PC. They've also been extremely responsive to feedback and have already added generic characters to the game so you can assign them jobs, a'la Final Fantasy Tactics.  Some of the background tiles are a little rough but the character sprites and animations are works of art. If you loved Fire Emblem, Wesnoth, or Final Fantasy Tactics, this game should fall directly in your wheelhouse.  The toolkit to create your own maps and campaigns is also included and I can't wait to see what the community is able to come up with.",

            "review_text": "Resources such as gold and weapons are pretty difficult to obtain in the game. Imagine when you buy all your hard earned gear, save your game and reload to find that all your gear has dissapeared or replaced with something you dont need! This happened to me after beating about 6 stages. Besides that horrible bug, there is also an issue that you only have acess to a shop once every few stages and once you exit a shop you cannot go back. This makes it very difficult to gear and plan for upcoming fights. The worst part in my opinion is that the battlefield is litterally littered with chests. But in order to get them you are seriously inconvenienced, such as wasting rounds on a map that is timed, getting beat on until you get the item because if all enemies die you leave the map, Sometimes that does not even work due to the stage ending abruptly for various reasons.",
