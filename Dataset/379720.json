            "review_text": "The single player campaign of Doom has exceeded all of my expectations I initially had toward it. My expectations were that I wanted it to be a great FPS game, and more importantly, a true DOOM title. I started the game on Nightmare difficulty right off the bat.  You will be fighting in the first 10 seconds of the game. Combat is challenging and very fluid with emphasis on speed, which they've certainly cranked up. Stopping is death on nightmare. Glory kills are satisfying, can be a ammo saver, and really don't hinder game flow at all, and can even be upgraded to perform faster (or toggled off in the options).  Level design is absolutely impressive. This was my biggest concern with Doom, and rest assured id FINALLY did it right. Non-linear, lots of exploration, plenty of secrets with hidden guns, secret level unlocks, and equipment.  The monsters are relentless. On nightmare you will get your ♥♥♥ kicked. This is a fact, and there's no way to circumvent this. I honestly felt at times that I was playing Project Brutality on 'Last Man on Earth' difficulty. Monsters boast a variety of attacks, chase you down, flank you, and can be tough as nails (sometimes a little too good).  Weapons look and feel satisfying, great attention to detail. You will use guns interchangeably, each has their respective uses. You'll have to search the environment for health and ammo, aside from the chainsaw kills on enemies, they drop little items- but enough to keep you going (i.e +5 health occasionaly or like 4 shotgun shells). The BFG literally clears an entire room in one shot, and I couldn't help but smile at the results. Upgrades and progression in this game are entirely optional, but really help shift the game to fit how you play (the air control ability is the best imo).  The graphics are incredible too, although you better have a strong card if you want to play on Ultra with anti-aliasing, etc. Uncapping framerate, setting your FOV to 130, tons of options to customize.  And I have to say, Mick Gordon's soundtrack in this game is some of the best I've heard in a while. On the third level, I was literally head banging and rocking out to a soundtrack that felt like a crossbreed between Lamb of God, Celldweller, and Rage Against the Machine.  Overall, I can confidently say that this is the Doom game we've wanted. We all can breath a sigh of relief now that the main portion of the game is actually well-done. That beta we played is absolutely no indicator of how the campaign plays in the slightest, and id did it right with this one. Definitely recommend this title as a gamer, a die hard Doom fan (still play the classic to this day), and FPS fanatic.  EDIT: Since some of you do not take the time to actually explore the game's options and like to jump to conclusions, you can in fact start the game on nightmare. Ultra-nightmare is unlocked after beating the game, NOT regular nightmare. Fact.",

Doomguy has had it with these edgy shooters, convinced that they 'mean something' or discuss 'serious issues' in an effective or at the very least parodical manner. Where the modern military shooter falls flat on its face, Doomguy doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥. Doomguy doesn't like it when cutscenes waste his time. Doomguy punches the plot. Literally.  This is a brilliant game about three things: moving fast, killing demons, and metal. It does these three things so ludicrously well that it is impossible not to recommend. Plenty of thinkpieces have discussed at length why exactly this game is so good on such a purely visceral level, so I'll leave it to them to give you the details. Suffice to say, this isn't to be missed.  As a side note: the highest difficulty can be unlocked for the first playthrough with a launch command, and if you're a pretty experienced kb&amp;m player, I would highly suggest doing so. And the MP is garbage - but don't let that dissuade you, as this would stand perfectly fine as a $60 release with only the campaign.",

The only downside I found is that they had planned a few DLC and a season pass worth $40 since day one, something that has become too common in recent AAA games unfortunately. You get a complete and good experience without DLCs though as they are focused on multiplayer.  All in all, I enjoyed it from start to end and had a lot of fun playing multiplayer too. ",

            "review_text": "I honestly thought I was over FPS games and haven't been interested in one - save for games like Fallout 4 which I wouldn't count - but it turns out that I was entirely wrong about my disinterest in the genre as a whole. It wasn’t all FPS games that I was over but drab brown gritty military FPS games that have lost my interest. Give me a twitch arena shooter like DOOM, set in a world pulled directly from my 13 year old wet dreams, and I am a kid in a candy store once again. I can't stop grinning while playing and every other second I find myself fist pumping - seriously - and saying 'Holy ♥♥♥♥ that was AWESOME' as I dismember another demon or pass through a portal to what can only be described as a pitch perfect recreation of my childhood fever dreams.  The graphics in this game are top notch. I'm running it on a the following: i5-3570K (not currently overclocked) GTX 970 16 gigs DDR3 Ram  I have all of the settings at ultra level - with the adaptive AA enabled - and it's running at 9000+ FPS. I haven't come across a single framerate drop or visual glitch/tear and I've only experienced 2 game crashes in my 16 hour playthrough of the single player campaign. I know that there are people with AMD cards, at the time of this review, that are having troubles and my heart goes out to them. I hope that those issues are fixed soon because this is a game that should not be missed.   Graphics are beautiful and there is so much post processing going on that I've often found myself standing in awe at some of the vistas in hell wondering how there is so much smoke and particle effects going on without dropping a single frame. The lighting is perfect for setting the mood and the enemy designs and animation are top notch. Jumping up on a platform only to find an imp scramble up right behind you is a fantastic experience because you truly feel like you're being chased and running for your life. The gameplay is a breath of fresh air which is ironic since it's due to the stripped down barebones nature of the gunplay. You fun, you jump, you shoot. YOU DO NOT RELOAD. Thank god for that. This game is about speed speed speed in a way that would satisfy Sanic’s need to go fast. If you're on the PC, you NEED to be playing it on the hardest difficulty your first playthrough because this is one of those rare games – ala dark souls – that equal parts challenges you and rewards you for skill based play. You die quickly which means you need to constantly be on the move and if I find myself standing still for more than a second or two I start to wonder 'how am I not dead yet?'. More often than not, it's because you are and you are staring at the reloading screen. Deaths never feel cheap and are almost always your fault. More than once I’ve kited a ton of enemies only to find myself doubled back directly into them. Those are learning experiences that make success feel even sweeter.   The versatility in the gun upgrade mechanic is a surprising plus that I did not see coming and the game is constantly dishing out upgrades and new guns to you to keep things fresh.  The sense of pace and urgency that DOOM creates sets a new gold standard for this type of twitch based arena shooter game. I hope we see a lot of copy cat games try to recreate the style of play you see in doom. I would love to have a resurgence of titles like Painkiller et al.   The level design is great in this game too. I was afraid that we'd be running down straight corridors like every other FPS on the market going from set piece to set piece when the levels in the original DOOM game were more like puzzles intricately laid out to always give the player a sense of forward momentum with plenty of progress markers and just enough backtracking to make you feel accomplished when you get that pesky yellow key and can open up a door that was previously inaccessible.  In a way, it reminds me a bit of the levels you'll find in a Metroidvania style game with lots of areas that are inaccessible without the right item or ability (yes, you get a double jump in the game that makes platforming easier).   The game is still broken up into levels so you can never backtrack from the end of the game to the beginning but each level is a multilayered labyrinth and they did a really good job of making it feel like a proper DOOM game in terms of level design.  The sound design in DOOM expertly sets the tone for the game and evokes the same fast past mayhem of the originals soundtrack while creating a fresh contrast to the frantic guitar with quieter serene moments in between fights. I really do enjoy the voices of all of the characters since they all have a decent amount of post processing to make them seem sufficiently robotic or demonoid. When it comes to SOME of the guns, the sound design is a bit of a mess. There is a missing low end that is really needed - for people like me who game with surround sound speakers with a sub-woofer - that really adds a satisfying punch when shooting. It's not terrible, but it's heavily biased to the mid and high range and lacks a lot of the impact I was hoping for. There is one cool sound effect that I love, though: The muffled sound of the bullets coming out of the machine gun when you aim down the sights (with one of the mods) sounds like someone shredding on a guitar. It's really quite cool.  Speaking of guitar, the soundtrack to this game is epic and they do a really good job with the modular industrial-electonic-metal-choir style that perfectly ramps up from serene moments when you're exploring to head banging metal when you're knee-deep in the dead. The soundtrack perfectly accompanies the violence and mayhem on screen while setting the mood, which is almost always one of the following: “Who did I kill next?!” or “my god…I can’t believe I survived that”. It's not often that I notice the soundtrack to a game and DOOM is a game where I'm constantly grinning because the music is perfectly setting the mood and I couldn't imagine playing my own music - which I what I often do - over this game because I LOVE the dynamic shifts between quiet serene choir chants to industrial metal when you round a corner into a horde of demons. They absolutely nailed it... and it didn't even require Nine Inch Nails this time....  Bad pun..........   If you miss the days of old school twitch based shooters and you lament the current trend of boring brown drab military shooters or cover based mechanics that force you to stand still and play what amounts to a carnival shooting gallery then DOOM is right up your alley.  *Multiplayer component of the review coming soon*  Graphics: 9.5 Sound: 9 Single Player: 8.7 Multiplayer: 7.7 Value: 9 SJW (game supports toxic masculinity and lacks strong black trans female presence): 3   Final Score: 8.8 SJW Score: 7.8",

The campaign is an enjoyable trip down memory lane as it replicates the basic formula that was prevalent two decades ago. With good level design, potent weaponry and smoothly-animated demons, its individual action pieces are stellar. Unfortunately the arena encounter formula persists right until the end, becoming too repetitive. Multiplayer is a competent mix of old and new that brings the hell-themed action close to that of other modern shooters. Finally, SnapMap gives players a fairly powerful set of tools to make simple creations in minutes.

            "review_text": "Surprisingly good, played through the whole campaign on nightmare and hunted every secret. While it isn't 100% true to the originals it still manages to remain Doom-esque in level design and enemy/weapon interactions (Preferring to use some weapons against certain enemies but not others, etc). The melee kill animations can fairly safely be ignored (Enemies drop health, but on nightmare the guaranteed health from a melee kill is negligible at 5 points, and the large health drops from kills happen if you're low on health and still happen from ranged kills too) or even smoothed into the gameplay with the rune system, which lets you speed the animations up to practically the point of the Doom 1 and 2 punch animation.  The multiplayer isn't the worst thing ever made but it isn't particularly good or noteworthy. Since you pick which weapons you start with all the weapons have been equalized for balance, there's no frantically running around the map to grab the rocket launcher when everyone can spawn with one and it does piddly damage since it has to be equivalent to everything else.  Snapmap has some cool potential, but since it's based around the MP rather than the SP there's a 2 weapon limit and the players can't pick a difficulty level, the map designer has to specifically set enemy HP, damage, etc. It also has a god-awful search system to try to find maps, so you'll have a hell of a time finding ones that look interesting. Not nearly as powerful as a full editor but some good may come of it eventually.  Overall really damn good. I still enjoyed Doom 3, but this is far closer to Doom 1 and 2 than 3 was.

            "review_text": "This is a modern version of the classic game that started a genre. It's fast, furious, and true to it's predecessors. Graphics are great and action is lightning quick and silky smooth. There are a few additions to the original Doom, namely gear enhancements ( I wish all the weapons had iron sights, but some have telescopic sites ) but you can happily just ignore all that and do what's best with this sort of game - shoot things.  There is nothing amazingly impressive about the game. In partuicular I am sure there will be complaints about the usual dark, miserable scenery. All the maps are completely unremarkable. Weapons are pretty dull. Sound effects aren't that great. The only thing that really stands out is the movement is very fluid and the shooting fast and precise. This is going to keep the pvp folks very happy indeed. I think this game most reminds me of Quake III arena.  The game also forces you to be fast and furious too. When the monsters spawn there is often no place to hide because the game carefully locks all the doors to make sure you can't run away!!  The game is pretty short. Although there are three bosses, with the original doom there were a myriad of levels between each one, but in this version there are far fewer. I personally think that is a teeny bit of a rip-off. I can't believe that these levels took that much time to create. I love the addition of some of the old ( original ) Doom levels. They are still the best!  With the PVP element and the ability to create user levels, I think they have done their best to emulate the original games, and that's great, but I am not completely sure that there will be the dedicated playerbase that there was with the older games, for one very simle reason - no matter how the game is updated, it's still pretty much the same game, and people will tire of that fairly quickly. The simple fact is that they needed to add something extra but they haven't. Well, lets be honest here, ID have a poor record ~ their original games were out of this world, but since those heady days they have shown little or no innovation, other than technical. You would expect this game to have flawless mechanics and graphics and it does, but that's it.  That aside, it's still a terrifc, fun game to play. It may not have vast longevity, but it's certainly well worth playing. For the truly dedicated doom'er then it's a version worth their attention. If you like the original games, or you like fast paced pure FPS, then this is wholeheartedly recommended.",

            "review_text": "DOOM is the newest game in the DOOM series. If you don't know anything about DOOM, it's about a marine shooting demons to save the world from demonic invasion, eventually closing up the portal between the human's dimension and hell. I know it sounds outrageous and I was skeptical too to the gameplay when I first heard about DOOM 3 (I'm too young for the original DOOM, DOOM 64, and DOOM 2). But it turns out to be beautifully written with several plot twists and I find the story very engaging and enjoyable. Unlike most other FPS, the combat style is VERY fast-paced where you will literally have to keep moving all the time if you don't want to get burned by fireballs, lasers, or any other kind of lethal stuff thrown by the demons. I'm not a gaming god that has 2000 games in my library so there might be other games out there that has the same extremely fast-paced combat style (like Bulletstorm?) so I assume this combat style as a unique aspect. In short, DOOM is a fast-paced, story-driven FPS that offers unique combat style with a lot of gore and GREAT metal musics that accompanies you whenever you're butchering demons.  Now, I'm going to talk about the good parts of the game. First of all, it's the combat system. I.Love.It. You get to do something called 'gore kill' where you'll kill a staggered demon with an extremely cool kill (and very bloody) animation. You can do a gore kill from above, from the leg, from the hands, from the chest, etc and each of them will show you different killing styles. As I said in my introduction paragraph, the combat style is overall extremely fast-paced. I find myself sitting on the edge of the seat everytime the combat 'session' starts. Graphics quality does not need to be questioned - it's epic. I finished the game on maxed out graphic settings and it was one hell of an experience. The gameplay has a recognizable pattern - you'll start with walking around trying to find a way to get to the next area. During this 'no-demons' part, you get to explore the environment to find various collectibles items like weapon upgrades, DOOM Marine dolls, Praetor suit (your badass armor) upgrades, classic DOOM maps, etc. And then, when you found the next 'area', the demons will start spawning and there you go - the metal music intensifies as you jump around from ledge to ledge, jump over demons and gore-kill them from above, shoot stuff, blow up stuff, lasers, rockets, fire, bullets, chainsaw, blood, blood, blood, blood, more blood, MOAR blood, and boom, you'll start with trying to find a way to the next 'area' again. This pattern will repeat over and over again as you progress through the story. Each combat 'session' is extremely challenging and I found myself scavenging for health, ammo, and armor desperately as the demons throw or shoot stuff at me (or try to crush me). Each demon has their own unique combat style with unique weak spots, since ammo management is critical in this game, it's very important to only shoot them on their weak spots, which makes it more challenging. The soundtrack is also very good. I'm not a fan of metal or rock musics myself but I enjoyed listening to the soundtrack. You also don't need to worry about not being able to understand the story because you didn't play the previous games. It might be pretty confusing at the start but everything will be explained as you progress.  Now, the bad parts of the game. Just like the Wolfenstein series, it has the fps drop bug (FPS stays between 10 to 20 fps on certain levels). I know it's not a serious issue since all you have to do is just restart the game and it will be back to normal. But I find it kind of annoying, especially because I had to wait for around 5 minutes for everything to load and to be able to click Exit. I also don't really like the fact that weapon and armor upgrades are hidden in secret areas. I'm not a fan of exploring stuff or finding secret area so I still have a lot of stuff locked when I finished the game. The BFG9000 (your ultimate weapon) puzzle also lack of clues. I stood on one of the platforms for around 15 minutes trying to figure out what the hell am I supposed to do. I eventually gave up and looked for the solution at YouTube just to find out that all I had to do was shoot stuff. Navigating around the map is also troublesome for me, some areas can only be reached after doing several parkour stuff, so whenever you accidentally fall, you'll have to re-do all the parkour stuff again.   In conclusion, IMHO, DOOM is a game worth every penny. The adrenaline rush during the fast-paced combat is the highlight of the game and I love it! I heavily recommend this game for any gamers looking for a casual gory FPS that doesn't require too much thinking.",

            "review_text": "Finishing it, Doom is all that it ought to be: a solitary player crusade that is just you, your super shotgun, and scarcely the measure of ammo required to slaughter each and every malevolence closeness on Mars. It feels like a Doom distraction as you genuinely attempt to discover success pickups to keep you going, a much of the time making zoological appear of devilishness homes snapping at your heels. It's debilitating and strengthening and a small piece nitwit, and when you're into it you're the partition in. To be sure, even under the scarcest positive conditions, Doom is a somber approach of encased rooms stacked with lowlifess, all of which you should murder to progress, supplemented by a reinforcement and misled multiplayer mode.   Early presentations savvy, Doom strikes all the right notes. The Union Aerospace Corporation's examination office on Mars runs red with the blood of authorities who've taken in another immensity for the expression 'wrongful end,' however that scarcely matters to the bafflingly quiet Doomguy, who shoots everything in any case which moves. Beginning with essentially the weapon urges you to concentrate on the misleadingly delightful Glory Kill framework — shoot your closest Demon enough that they persuade the chance to be astounded and highlighted in blue or orange, and on the off chance that you pulverize F (or R3 on a PS4 controller) while staying by them you will attack a balance of. That is to say, you'll remove their individuals and, in more than a few cases, blissfully beat them with their own particular cutoff points.   The naughty soul eject on the working environment is a consequence of most exceedingly terrible strategy for accomplishment ever — to block Hell from securing its vitality assets — and security shields see to it that you can't open most gateways if any fallen holy messengers are still alive. These are murder chambers, a relic of a period of shooter plan everything beside gone, proposed to contain you and urge you into a specific playstyle. Where beguilements with recovering thriving compensate players who disguise and pick off foes each one in this manner, Doom rather compels you to diagram a course through the chamber attempting to discover flourishing while diligent enough long to twist up overpowered.   Execution sharp, Doom is id Software's best stimulation in late memory. Seethe had colossal measures of issues in spite of for those fortunate few with the right mix of PC parts, however Doom's most conspicuous distortions so far have been a couple mishandle less pummels into desktop and some to an amazing degree odd cut-out issues. Outside of an unpretentious pack of slips it kept running at a strong 60 plots for reliably on my GTX 780, and it has a striking similarity time. The way it handles lighting is as a not exactly tried and true manage reminiscent of Doom 3's likewise lessen world, however here no time is abused in enlightening things. Similar reliability paid to the level outline has been given to the world workmanship, which surmises there are incessantly fascinating portions of the world to get from the conditions, similar to vehicle repair sounds stacked with the hardware imperative to settle the Mars-twisting trucks on the base, including heaps of extra tires. The key trap here is that you have to back enough off to really look.   In the multiplayer portion of Doom the tone is inside and out noteworthy. Where the single-player bundle of Doom is essentially old school with a few new traps, multiplayer gets excitedly from bleeding edge shooters, neglecting its principal foundations and in this way persuading the chance to be awful.   Like Halo, Call of Duty, and most other bleeding edge shooters, Doom limits you to only two weapons, yet it gives you both weapons when you convey. This recommends you discover the open door in any case the Super Shotgun and the Plasma Cannon on the off chance that you wish (however here, not at all like in the crusade, the Combat Shotgun is really better than the Super Shotgun). This isn't characteristically appalling — in light of current conditions, it works in an extensive variety of preoccupations.   In perspective of Loadouts, pickups on the guide are either dispatched to flourishing, guarded layer, and ammo, or they're lifted to gifted moment win things. Quad Damage, Haste, and Regeneration all make in settled places on Doom's maps, as do power weapons like the one-shot murder BFG and Gauss Rifle or the cutting contraption. With weapons dispatched on convey by strategy for loadouts, the measure of potential clash zones is reduced — on most maps to only two — and in light of the way that power things are reliably covered (to a particular degree) areas of question are on an exceptionally essential level self-decisive.   Fate in like way joins a simple to-utilize level article manager, called SnapMap, and the social occasion appearances that've sprung up from it are shortly the highlight of the multiplayer encounter. In SnapMap you can make your own particular levels for powerful or pleasing multiplayer, and it's as clear as snapping together pre-made level tiles. The instructional practice is magnificent, helped along by the simplicity of the contraptions themselves, which proposes you can begin making your own fantasy portray no time. The simplicity has its obstacles, administrator among them being that SnapMap is not a trade for a full modding SDK, so while you can make some amazing things with it you won't be capable on a to a great degree basic level change the strategy for Doom itself. While making shooter levels is conceivable, you can't generally change Doom into a RTS the way you can change StarCraft 2 into a shooter.   Considering all things, limitations incite innovativeness, and no place is this favored assert over in the Community depict. You can fitting your made maps for the world to study and recognize, and through near framework you can see what others have assembled. A general public blueprint played was a cross between an incremental clicker and a cell crawler — something like the program based do-nothing hit A Dark Room. You tap on property degrees to water plants which turnover seeds, which you spend on making more plants. When you have enough plants making seeds, you can spend those seeds on getting to two or three mines, and not long after in the wake of finishing the end of the mines do you finish the level. It was such a peculiarity at each level that I genuinely expected to envision that its captivating.   Predetermination is a record of two outright different shooters (and one particular creation instrument). The single-player crusade's cognizant love of the arrangement's key foundations understands an old-school run-and-weapon shooter which feels like emulate Doom, a front of an old hit which nails all the right power harmonies yet isn't precisely transformative. The multiplayer's endeavors to gain from the new to reinvigorate the old results in an endeavor which won't fulfill either school of thought. SnapMap, meanwhile, is a mix of difficult to miss and crucial and captivating.

            "review_text": "'Doom' is a remake of a very popular FPS (French Playground Simulator) named 'Buckaroo Larry's Win Handsome Fun Zone' that was first released for the Commodore 64 back in 1974. It won many awards and critical acclaims from magazines such as 'Computers And Stuff That Has Wires Attached to them Monthly.' which described it as 'amazing... I never imagined I would some day be able to mow my lawn in space, all from the convenience of my home computer machine!' Copies were sold at Babbages for $1.99, and if you purchased two of them, you would receive a cloth map showing Richard Garriott's face.  While this new 'Doom' is quite different from its precessor, it does share many similiar features. For example, your character can move (I believe they call it 'running' or 'walking'). There are guns in this game, but I don't know what you're supposed to do with them or why you need them because I was homeschooled and live in a series of closets connected by a central hallway. I asked my friend Jeff K. what the plot of the game was, and although I coun't exactly understand him (I was blowdrying my hair), it sounded something like this:  'You... guy. Space guy. Make good (cramwitch) from a (fist slug forgery?). So NO NO NO don't do that, you need the Buttersworth! Yes. Parp. It's grunty (Fat Louie?)'  Sorry I couldn't be of more help, but it was late at night and I did not want to wake up mother because she might lock me in the training box if she heard me. Overall, I would recommend this game 9/10, but please make sure you have a PC or something that can play it before you buy it (this has happened to me so many times I stopped counting).  Peace out",

            "review_text": "For new players, Doom offers an interesting break from the usual first-person shooter style you might be familiar with (Call of Duty, Halo 5, etc.) and instead puts a focus on in-your-face, bloody combat. You'll be close with your enemies in this game, rather than picking them off from a longer distance. And it's this close-quarters focus that really brings out the game's intensity. It's constant, fast-paced action all the way through, with only occasional breaks from the carnage.  For classic Doom veterans, this game is not too far from the norm of a Doom game. It's fast-paced, visceral and brutal. You can feel like a true badass again, destroying anything in your path, but you're never shy of a challenge. The demons will mess you up if you don't keep yourself killing. And of course, just like any true Doom game, you should always be on the move.  The campaign has a nice story to it, but it rarely forces you to pay attention to it. You spend more time killing demons, which is a great thing. Most story segments you can actually just walk away from and continue killing.  Doom also introduces some new mechanics, such as glory kills - fully animated executions performed against your enemies, each one gory and...well, glorious. You have a variety of unique guns to choose from, just like any good first-person shooter, but in singleplayer, you get to modify your weapons with upgrades, new firemodes, and the like. You can also upgrade your suit abilities in singleplayer - anything from blast resistance, to a more intricate map. Further suit upgrades can be achieved through obtaining runes - gained by completing quick challenges. These runes let you get new benefits, such as armor-for-kills or increased mobility.  The multiplayer modes are, surprisingly, a really strong point of the game. Deathmatch game modes can get hectic and crazy, especially if you bring friends along. The 'demon rune' - a powerup that lets you turn into a demon for a short amount of time - can be a real game changer, and ends up directing a lot of focus on the big guy.  There's also a level editor (SnapMap), which has it's design limits, but is still really fun and can be used very creatively. This level editor can make solo/co-op missions, wave-based survival games, bloodbath arenas...I even saw someone make a Harvest Moon-type game.  In both multiplayer and SnapMap, you're allowed to customize your weapons and armor to your liking. In multiplayer modes, things like colors, armor pieces, and extra loadout items are obtainable through an XP system. In SnapMap, though, you earn these by buying them with SnapPoints - an entirely in-game currency gained by playing and creating SnapMap levels. This system keeps you playing and creating for a good while.  Overall, Doom is an amazing game for both veterans and newcomers to the series, and has an outstanding amount of content to keep you going. I would say that id Software definitely delivered us the true return to the series everyone has been waiting for - because believe me, Doom 3 sure wasn't that.",

Thankfully new Doom is nothing like this and is another addition to the great single-player FPSes of recent years alongside Doom’s sister series Wolfenstein, Shadow Warrior, and Metro: Last Light. It’s also pretty much the best Painkiller game too.  New Doom is a great blending of the old and the new just like Wolfenstein: The New Order. It has a lot of modern conveniences such as generous checkpoints but it still has some old school sensibilities in how it plays. There is no regenerating health, you got to find packs or get them off of enemies. The game gives some of the best mobility I’ve seen in an FPS, there’s no cowering behind waist high walls here. Doomguy runs by default and stuff like double jumps and ledge grabs add to this mobility even more. The levels are quite sizable and allow you to maneuver around the arenas in multiple ways. The weapons are real fun to use, especially the Super Shotgun.  Doom has a rather long campaign, if you blaze throughout it’ll probably take you around ten hours. But there’s a lot of secrets to find in the levels, including ones that unlock classic Doom levels that you can play akin to playing through Wolfenstein 3D in TNO/The Old Blood. So that can definitely extend your playtime. There’s also a level creator so you can play other people’s maps as well as make your own. There’s multiplayer, and while I haven’t touched it yet, it seems like it’s already been dead due to Bethseda’s misplaced belief that people wanted to have a multiplayer mode in a Doom game.   Doom’s writing is good in the sense that it’s unobtrusive and helps the game along. It’s not like New Order which actually had some solid writing, but the game knows people just want to rip and tear some demons so it doesn’t take itself too seriously. There’s also shoutouts to stuff from earlier games as well.  While Doom is a great game I ran into several bugs, three of which caused CTDs and the other two broke the game. (I couldn’t shoot my guns after going into a teleporter while switching my guns as well as one where the switch to activate a door didn’t appear.) It didn’t really mar the experience but it’s the only flaw it had. Also I wish Bethesda would make single-player DLC maps instead of just having the Season Pass be all multiplayer stuff.  So in the end, Doom is a damn fine game and a must play for single-player FPS fans.",

But, of course, you can't make a perfect game. There will always be some Doom 'hardcore fans' who want basically Doom 1 HD Remaster.

A very long and troubled development cycle, no review copies sent out before release, a multiplayer that was poorly received and did not sound or look all that exciting.  I did end up getting it anyway (a good deal on greenmangaming), I had to see what id had done to make a follow-up to what was perhaps my two most favorite games ever.  About 5 seconds after the loadscreen is gone you have a gun in your hand and are shooting zombie guys. 30 seconds later you've violently destroyed a couple more in grotesquely violent melee animations and picked up a shotgun. Shortly you're off over the surface of Mars, through a bunch of sci-fi facilities in the sort of style that Doom 3 laid out, but far more open, expansive and brightly lit. The game looks great, even on medium settings (+85% res) that I was forced to run it at to get a performance that'd sit stable in the 45-60fps range. (2560x1440, 2gb 680gtx, i5 3570k, 16gb ram).  Melee finishing animations were a hotly debated topic, but they are so short they don't interrupt the flow of combat. In later levels they become sort of your in-combat health-regen and later on you can equip a powerup to shorten their duration further.  The gunplay is extremely enjoyable, every single gun has a distinct feel, good sound effects, nice visuals and all are upgradable with interesting alternate firemods that can be upgraded further to improve on their effect, ending up in a Mastery Unlock that buffs the alternate mode fully.  The enemy gallery is almost entirely the classic Doom lineup buffed with a few extra new monsters and new takes on former humans.  Absent from the game are the Arachnotron and the Archvile, the latter replaced by the Summoner the Summoner, a sort of new version of the Archvile. It doesn't feel as threatening, but it shares the agility and speed of all the other monsters in this game.  Which is something quite new and fresh in the FPS genre. The monsters literally jump and climb all over the environment, dodging and weaving to avoid your shots or position themselves to rain lasers down on you. You'll be doing the same, moving with speed up and down ledges, no fall damage is present, so your freedom to move is great. Later in the game you'll get a double-jump and a powerup that lets you move faster after performing melee kills, a powerup that lets you control yourself while in the air much like in Quake 1 and powerups that let you engage melee kills from farther away.  All this combines to a combat system that feels smooth, precise, extremely fun and very rewarding.   I find it to the game's credit that dying seems entirely my own fault for not taking good enough advantage of the options allowed me. And the options are many. You can carry all the game's weapons and you will be swapping between them often and you'll have many, many available approaches in every single fight.   The soundtrack is blazing modern industrial style metal in combat, out of combat there is a light ambient drone, all of it heavily inspired by the original Doom soundtrack. There are many, many eastereggs and little things paying homage to the original games in here and it's clear that it's been made by someone who obviously cared a lot.  With the snapmap editor allowing community creations and a robust replayability, I foresee Doom staying on my drive for quite a while. I hope to see more.  I have not had any experience with the multiplayer, but I'll probably take a look at some point, but it's not why I bought the game and not why you should either, I'd reckon.  Highly recommended.",

About campaign; Story; well it has a story but it ain't important too much, even game offers you some extra story such as readible entries. If you want a game with a solid story then this game is not for you. However story never was what this game has offered. So you probably know this.   Enemies are like they actually have brains or something, you don't know what they're gonna do. They can climb up ledges, turn away and attack you anytime, or suddenly escape from you and start attacking from range (unless they are Pinkies). All of the enemies feel annoying more than they were in Doom I &amp; II thus making combat really insane.   Combat is really challenging yet fun and somehow encourages to try again if you fail somehow. Game is really fast, you run really really fast and you may think that you've missed something before such as secrets. Its really awesome but my only problem was motion blur. It made me dizzy few times so I had to give a rest, you may want to close it.  They are secrets, they are not big nor hard to find. You can come across few secrets in a level even if you are playing linearly. I suppose its fine.   Music is awesome, electronic elements mixed with heavy ♥♥♥ distorted 9-stringed guitars, pumps you more to kill some more. However I haven't liked weapon sounds too much especially normal Shotgun.   Shotgun and Pistol sucks in this game. They do. Only they do. Yeah this is about campaign. As I've said before I really haven't played too much of multiplayer (only played in beta) so I don't have a review for it yet. I will update if I find it necessary.  About SnapMap; it is a easy to use modding tool. While it doesn't have unlimited range between what you can do with what you cannot do, I think that it is a really flexible tool. I would recommend you to give it a try. Learning it can take a few hours so be patient, it is REALLY easy compared to other official and non-official modding tools for other games. Currently I've been trying to make a RPG mod but I don't know, it may turn out to be a Crack-Life.  Anyway, campaign is fun, SnapMap is fun. Game really feels like it is Doom.

I mean, sure, there's the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ token RPG elements, and the 'kill 250 demons with your hands tied behind your back' type quests are out in full force, but I guess we expect those things because people complain about progression and everything has to have a grind now, I guess. So because of those things, the game takes a little while to really get started.'  'But what happens when it does?'  '...holy bejesus, you have no idea. You don't. Sure, the demo gives you a taste of what to expect, but what happens there is nothing compared to what happens after. I remember seeing a Berserk powerup before one arena, and I immediately went for it. Don't do that. Wait until the big guys come out. Then you start chaining together kills - punching a small guy, then another small guy, then you attack this giant beefcake of a monster and rip him to shreds, then the next one, blood and limbs flying everywhere, just ♥♥♥♥ing destroying everything until they're all gone. And it made me feel ♥♥♥♥ing powerful. Like I had transcended. And the game is full of moments like that. Just furious, explosive murder with an optional side of timing if you want the best, bloodiest results.'  'Ah. How's multiplayer?'  'It's ♥♥♥♥ing boring.'",

            "review_text": "New DOOM is here. I played a couple of hours with it and The Verdict for me with about 2 hours of gameplay. Solid, amazing, Feeling Classic and new. It is Amazing and Great and not something to shrug at because its Bethesda or being Triple A. Granted the Multiplayer is a disappointed in many ways in terms of the 'Default' settings, there is some Classic stuff in Snapmap options but thats it.  On to the real game, If you have the money and you were skeptical. I would say that there is nothing That Wrong with the game. It starts strong, Gets stronger. and its hella fun. the gunplay is exactly what you would want in a classic style like game of the old doom, ROTT and Quake. the Weapon Mod system is not bad addition an feels fluent with how they work. the monsters all have very specific game styles and how to avoid them, Movement is fast and hectic and only stops once rooms are cleared just like how the old days where. there is never a instant respawn of unlimited enemies. Look Fantastic and would say everything there is a good Solid Doom game. Though for me Personally There are some features I dont like but its not a insult or a ruiner of the game but stings me in a small way in terms of the mechanic choose they imposed.  The First one is that the Glory Execution Kills, While Graphical its damn impressive in the mechanics and how much scripting they used, Different animations based on where your Doom Marine position is and where you are looking gives you different types. However, what im not impressed by is you are almost Reliant of them which I was hoping was not the case. When you use any weapon, it takes a couple of shots to cause them to be in a 'stunned' state. then you can just walk up and Press Melee. the problem I see is that if you want Extra Ammo and Health drops from them, This is your only way besides the Chainsaw, To get such items. If you picked up all the health and ammo picks up on the map normally. you have to resort to Animation Kills over and over just to get it back. and the Chainsaw if you want a Plethora of ammo back using its ammo charge in a instant animation kill. I will understand the animations are very quick of about .8 to 1.3 seconds depending on the enemy. But the fact you are Reliant of such mechanic to stay alive bugs me on a personal level.  2nd, Im Perfectly fine with a upgrade system in a game, as long as it doesnt feel forceful or doesnt seem stupid to add upgrades for upgrades sake. and For new Doom, Im hesitant. There are on average 3 to 5 upgrades per Module Per weapon, and there are about 10 weapons in the game I believe. You earn the weapon upgrades through 'challenges' (one example was to do 5 Glory Kills on the possessed) to get Weapon Upgrade points, and are different challenges Per level. Then there is your Praetor suit, which you earn those upgrades through dead elite guards in hidden areas to collect there chips. Then the Argent Cells to permanent upgrade your health. armor and ammo Capacity. THEN there is the Rune system that gives different characteristics that can be changed on the fly. To me personally I feel that was a bit to much upgrading ideas for the Sake of Upgrading. the only argue rebuttal Ive heard was 'it has a New Game Plus, for Nightmare or Perma Death mode'. But for me, If Bethseda didnt claim 'this is Doom back to its roots' or 'no cutscenes fast pace action demon killing' then I would let all of the upgrading slide. but they did and it feels unnecessary to me in Some Departments, not all Mind you.  Those are Personal complaints that no way derail the game or makes me feel its bad, because its not in any way. The overabundance of Secrets to be found. a Map that can be access to figure out locations and areas of those secrets is so much fun again in the years I havent seen such a thing because some indie like titles (like ROTT 2013 Reboot). Im a little sad the map does show you exactly what items to be found, like Elite Guards, Bots to get Mod purchases etc. But it doesnt change how much you can move in this game. It never seems that you are locked out from a passed location During a level. Once you finish what is considered the Level, then you can no longer return to that location and move forward. The Jumping is amazing to feel and climbing everything makes you look carefully for any location that can be used for such puzzles in a sense.  Graphical amazing, Runs super smooth. can turn off Motion Blur, DoF, and have a FOV of 130 for PC (and I believe Consoles now have such a option). Feels fresh then most games and in a lot of ways not something to shine away from. The singleplayer is a lot of fun so far. There are a lot of dialogue that seems to happen but its usually breif with one paragraph of words that you can just Walk away from hearing, to most of it being a Codex system in your menus detailing all environments, datalogs, demon creatures, and the weapons. Happy to be there if you like to read, or ignore for just more killing demons. Its bloody its gorey and it works for a Triple A for once.  Buy it if you have the money, Its not a waste of time. It is not a Disappointed, its not a failed hype train. It is a new Doom that besides some minor complaints I Personally have. Im Happy, Excited and loving to play it more.",

            "review_text": "DOOM is great.  It's full-on fast paced fun with lots to discover, there's a great and meaningful variety of weapons and unlocks, the health / ammo system is brilliantly balanced, the melee glory kills system is graceful and balletic in the midst of frenetic combat, the levels are chock-full of secrets and bonus challenges, the enemy variety is both interesting and meaningful in combat...  DOOM is great.  The campaign story is played just the right way, there's just enough to keep you invested, it doesn't take over, the protagonist is angry at everything, and your main goal is to blast everything in the face until it dies. There are some big moments, but nothing earth-(or mars)-shattering, but it is varied and interesting enough to draw you through. The art style is great, with a great variety in colours and map styles, and the weapons and models are all gorgeous.  DOOM is great.  The multiplayer is not so great, whilst a throwback to Unreal Tournament style of gameplay, it didn't hold my interest for long, and I'm not a big fan of the snapmaps system (which creates maps that feel clunky and like they're made on a tile system, because they are). Maybe some will get some great fun out of these options, but I considered them some underwhelming extras to dive into if you so wish. The meat of the game is the campaign, and it is glorious.

DOOM (4) is the first game in a long time to give me hope, especially from an idthesda game, that it's possible for the old school to get a fresh coat of paint and still look good.  The game is raw and non-stop combat with large sprawling levels with lots of vertical and horizontal movement and plenty of demons to blast. Visuals have only been getting better since the Build Engine, and as much as I've hated the modern idtech engine games (MEGATEXTURES DURRRR), idthesda has managed to actually make them work. There are lots of little gameplay details that keep the game moving (weapon wheel bound to one button, fast 'glory kills' that give back health a la 40k Space Marine, etc). It's one of the best games I've played in a long time and I don't regret paying release price. Their version of the Reflex map-maker and Halo 3's FORGE is great as well; doesn't have the customization of a Build Engine .wad but the gameplay is still there and at the end of the day, that's what really matters.  Multiplayer blows, though. That's just Halo with a reskin. Play it for a bit if you want, but you're not gonna have a whole lot of long-term fun.",

Pros: -Excellent level design -Return of 'Secrets' across each level -'Always Run' is back -Old School mechanics (health packs, holding all 10 weapons) -Epic score of industrial/metal music -Excellent visuals -Well optimized for PC -Gameplay is stellar -Enemy design is grotesque and gory -Memorable boss fights -Snapmap is a great addition to the game -Good length campaign (~10 hours on ULTRA-VIOLENCE difficulty)  Meh: -Multiplayer is just OK, some old school Doom fans will be disappointed  Cons: -Some campaign arenas can get repetitive (Gore Bags)  Performance:  Rig Used: EVGA GTX 980 4GB of VRAM, 16GB DDR3 RAM, i5 3570K.

There are unlocks and other light RPG elements, but they're implemented tastefully in a way that 1) gets you to develop your skills and 2) never feels like a grind. I'm currently working on Ultra-Violence difficulty and have found it rewarding to try the game at harder difficulties. I'm personally staying far away from the highest difficulty with perma-death but if that's your thing, knock yourself out.  It's kind of strange that id/Bethesda did a couple of rounds of closed multiplayer testing before release. One one hand, they probably wanted to avoid launch day multiplayer issues, but on the other hand, it wasn't well received and shifted focus away from the strongest part of DOOM, which is its single-player campaign. I played a little bit of the multiplayer during alpha, beta, and now release. Honestly, there's nothing really wrong with it. Most of the criticism stems from the fact that it doesn't really do anything ground breaking and is very business-as-usual. Which it is.  You should buy this game for the excellent single-player component. If you're looking for a competitive FPS, Call of Duty, Battlefield, and Counter-Strike pretty much have that space nicely covered.

There are secrets, powerups, and upgrades to find and use, some of which are nods to classic games while others are just plain entertaining to discover. The game also seems to want to be placed on sale quite often, and if you aren't squeamish and are prepared to shoot, punch, and chainsaw demons and explode them into item pinatas, I can't recommend the game enough if it's on discount.  Well, I do have to say the game is fairly demanding and is prompting a refresh of my years-old computer, so while it does have large vistas of alien planets, hellish chasms and tech bases it can push older hardware to their limits. It is also pretty annoying waiting for the game to reload if you die.   Overall though, considering the amount of saturation the genre has had over the last decade, it's almost refreshing how well the developers managed to create something that not only held true to many of the design aspects of past games but managed to make a game that feels great to play even now.",

I beat the campaign on ultra violence in 9 hours.  Pros ------------------------------ -It's Doom/Hell themed. We don't get too many gorgeous video games centered around Hell. -It's well optimized. I was able to run the game on ultra settings at 2560x1440 while sticking mostly in the 50-60fps range off of a GTX 980. -The sound design is great. -They give you tons of options for customizing your HUD. -Shooting demons in the face is fun.  Cons ------------------------------ -People seem to think this is just like good ol' Doom 1 &amp; 2 but I really don't think they remember how those played. The levels in this are set up that you'll shoot a few weak enemies on your way to a main objective marker before getting trapped in an area that you can only get out of if you kill every last enemy in the room.

I was able to run the game on ultra settings at 2560x1440 while sticking mostly in the 50-60fps range off of a GTX 980. -The sound design is great. -They give you tons of options for customizing your HUD. -Shooting demons in the face is fun.  Cons ------------------------------ -People seem to think this is just like good ol' Doom 1 &amp; 2 but I really don't think they remember how those played. The levels in this are set up that you'll shoot a few weak enemies on your way to a main objective marker before getting trapped in an area that you can only get out of if you kill every last enemy in the room.

It's the good old doom-style of shoot demons, acquire keycards and then shoot more demons. Very fast paced and rather challenging on higher difficulties. It's also full to the brim with eastereggs, collectibles and nods to other games. Very motivating to explore every last inch of the map.  Multiplayer is alright, but has some latency issues, resulting in long-range meleekills and other frustrating situations. Still a fun game to play every now and then.  SnapMap seems like a nice addition as well. Didn't mess around it myself yet, but it seems like talented people can make some really nice stuff. ;)  Overall totally worth the money for the singleplayer alone. MP and SnapMap are nice additions, but not the main selling point of DOOM.",

Glory kills are ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. The weapon upgrades and rune system are sweet and add a nice sense of progression.

            "review_text": " Disclaimer: I have not played the multiplayer AT ALL. It does not factor into my review.   So, DOOM! I did not play DOOM 3, so the last time I had played a DOOM game was back in the late 90s. I am happy to say that this game both does and does not feel like a game from that era.    Pros:       Gameplay:  Everything feels tight and reactive. The shooting, guns, enemies, and environments are very visceral. I do not know the last time I played a single-player FPS that was this frantic and incredibly satisfying.      Secrets:  I am a  sucker  for secrets &amp; collectables in a game. DOOM harkens back to older titles in that secrets are plentiful and rewarding to hunt down. It was also a nice touch to be able to see how many secrets were in each level, but not explicitly where to find them.      Level Design:  This is something I feel many FPS games do not do well. DOOM nails it. Whilst there are obvious paths to follow, there are also many places to explore and most of them aren't secrets! Arenas are multi-leveled, especially after you obtain the ability to double-jump. This allows for a lot of mobility and dodging during combat, which you will need!      Weapons/Runes:  I have to give them their own seperate section away from general gameplay, because they added so much. Every weapon (with the exception of two) has distinct upgrades that change how you play. I had some favorites, no doubt, but none of the weapons ever felt useless. Every option brought something to the table. The same goes for the Runes.      Graphics/Design:  The game is beautiful, in it's own 'everything is bloody and ♥♥♥♥ed up' way.     Cons:       Storyline:  If you're looking for an amazing story, you will not find it here. Don't get me wrong, DOOM's story is good for what it is, especially if you're into the whole 'Hell is a place on Mars' fiction. However, there isn't much in the way of character development. This is not Bioshock.      Repetition:  This is here mostly to show that I'm not entirely biased for the game. It did not apply to me, but if you do not get into the combat in DOOM within the first few missions, then you will not enjoy the rest of this game. You  will  spend most of the game shooting and dismembering demons. Because, well, that's what DOOM is!   DOOM scratched multiple itches for me that I didn't even know that I had. Amazingly crisp and exciting combat mixed in with searching every level for secrets kept me entranced for quite awhile. I am happy with this game and do gladly recommend it to anybody who enjoys these sorts of experiences.",

            "review_text": "So what do I think about the new doom? Well there are three parts to judge, and I will review each part.   The single player, easily the best part of the game, the single player of the game is hands down the best of the three features. The single player of this game was so good I bet it will win many best shooter and game of the year awards just because of how enjoyable the single player was. The levels are non linear, have replay value are challenging, full of secrets, monster variety and guns. The game get more added in the later you play and you can carry all your guns through the levels with you making combat much more fun, you have no limits to the number of guns you can carry. the story of the game is great, you dont have to spend for than a few miniutes listening to exposition and most of the time when you do doom guy is angry and destroys anything in the way of him killing demons and that includes a computer telling you story. The game starts out and in a few seconds you get to start shooting things. You can read PDAs if you care about story and you spend 95% of the single player shooting things, the way it should be.   The snap map. How good is snapmap? Well there are two ways to look at his, for consoles it is much better than the map maker in halo forge and will get more added to it in the future so it might get a little better but the issue with it is that there are stupid map making limits in the builder the classic doom builder 2 is a better map maker because you can make a map with 100,000 demons on it while in the new doom game there is a limit to the numbers of monster allowed in game to be spawned at a time and a limit on the number of monsters allowed on the map total as well as a limit on the map size. Clearly the map maker was made with consoles in mind and that would be okay if the game had external mod support like classic doom did but sadly the new doom does not. The snap map builder is easy to use and and I guess a good introduction to learning how to make maps miles ahead of halo forge but if you have used any kind of good map maker snap map is not as good as map builders that are 20 years old sadly but on consoles it is the best map builder available.   The multiplayer.... The worst part of the game in my opinion. I got the game a few weeks after the game came out and the online multiplayer was quite barren with only a few thousand players on it. Why is the multiplayer not nearly as good as the single player or other online shooters? There are many reasons why the doom online multiplayer is bad such as being made by halo developers, having limitations like 2 guns only, loadouts, perks that the game calls hack modules that are basically like power up cards, the game is poorly balanced because a level 1 player has HUGE disadvantages and a level 50 has HUGE advantages. You do not even start with all items or guns, you can save up and earn hack modules that are basically just like the hated cards or perks in halo 5 that if you save up enough of you get unfair advantages over players who don't have these items. Some of the power ups include temporary unlimited ammo, extra armor and knowing both the health AND location of the player that killed you and there are 3 theirs of these power ups bronze silver and gold better the higher the tier. The multiplayer is very unfair and poorly balanced for 4 reasons, 1 The higher your level the more guns items you have that a level 1 player does not. This gives you more variety and different guns to use on players who don't have the same options that you do. Items are also given out to higher levels and they can give advantages to players who can use them on players who don't have them.  2 Hack modules are unfair because the more matches you play regardless of level even if your the same Max level a player who has more hack modules than you has things like knowing your Hp AND where you are on the map, infinite ammo for the beginning of the map and more armor. If you save up these and use them on new players or players who don't save modules you have a unfair advantage over newer players.  3 Demon runes, demon runes are fun the first few times it nice to play as a demon its fun you get a few free kills and you think everything is good right? Well no it is unfair because demon overpower marines. You might think oh its fair because they get some power if I get some power too right? Well you don't un lock all the deom runes at the start of the game you only get one out of 4 and you get 3 demons at level 15. So this is just really unfair to newer players because they don't even have the same runes, guns, hack modules, items, etc that you do. On the other hand haste and quad damage power ups from quake are fair because if you kill the other player you get to take the quad damage from him the second you kill him while the timer for the item is still active. You may or may not get the demon rune because it may not spawn even if you can kill a demon that has much higher dps and health than you. Also the most popular game mods are ones that have the fewest demon runes.  4 Community after a few days playing I have already heard about people cheating in the multiplayer, I haven't seen it to be sure but it might be in the player base. There are not very many people playing the multiplayer so as far as I can tell on PC it is dying. Another hug issue is groups and balance. If you have a few level 50 friends and you as a group go into team deathmatch you will all be on the same team even if the other team is level 1-10 and your team is leveled 40-50. Making the multiplayer even more unfair but at least it is really really easy to play with friends.   So do I recommend the game? I do but it is worth it for the single player alone, snap map is okay but could have been much better with just mod support, and I really don't like the multiplayer because it is very unfair to players in many ways but it is enjoyable and you can get kills easy with the gauss cannon, demon runes and that's fun but it is also unfair when you get killed in one shoot by heat seeking missiles, a BFG/gauss cannon blast or by advantages of hack modules. I payed 80 dollars for the game and I am happy I did. Buy it for single player and if you want to make a few maps or play a multiplayer few matches for only a few hours but you want a great singleplayer story.",

So i wrap it up in really short sentences below.  1)As someone who plays doom with different wads since 3 years old to this day, i wholehearthedly approve of the singleplayer. 2)It's basically Quake in Doom universe, which is double good: You jump around and shoot things. 3)Weapons are fantastic, except for plasma rifle that shots bubbles made of yeti's pubic hair. 4)Soundtrack reminds of Quake and Doom at the same time. Noice. 5)Maps are well designed for gunplay, but half of the secrets placed so obvious it hurts, while other half you'll notice on the map only after BLOODY DOOR IS CLOSED BEHIND YOU AND YOU CAN'T GO BACK. 6)I watched SgtMark playing this game like an absolute scrublord, and it made me chuckle. 7)Multiplayer is rubbish. 8)Snapmap is a Super Mario Maker. 9)Has Denuvo, an entity more vile than sixteen Hitlers in a summer dress. 10)Looks great and works stable 50- 60 fps on 770 and i5 2400 on ultra settings without AA like no problem fam.  11)Except one day it will randomly crash every 5 minutes, and other day you can play splendidly with no hiccups. 12)I blame Denuvo. 13)Classic Doom had CO-OP in main campaign from the start. This one does not. 14)Cacodemons bleed red. YOU HAD ONE JOB. 15)Revenants used to be way more spooky. 16)Whole game doesn't look like incarnation of all the eighties speed metal album covers. 17)Still looks pretty dank though. 18)If you're not disabling glory kill blinking, then there's something entirely wrong with you. Demons have stagger animation anyway, and without obnoxious blinking it's actually fun to use glory kills 19)It's only 10 hours of campaign for 60 bucks. It's 10 amazing hours, granted, but you're paying 10 bucks per hour.  20)'No you're wrong, it has much more value because of Mario Maker and hilarious maps where you can chat with a cacodemon xD'.     21)LISTEN TO THIS: according to game files and some fan speculation that makes too much sense, Doomguy actually been through all previous games and all custom wads. Even the one where you sit in the room where Linking Park is playing through the speakers and only able to kill yourself. Considering i'm perfectly sure there existed MyLittlePony.wad at some time, i have absolutely no doubts why is he so angry. And John was actually the demons. And why stop there and not include all the fanfiction into canon too? Now that's what i call HELL.   Overall it's best pleasant surprise in years, considering that most gameplay videos that were shown prior to release looked awful. It feels great, it's like good old friend coming back home in a good health and with dank stories to tell. I really hope they make new Quake too... And actually not outsource multiplayer and will give people actual modding tools, lmao.  I give this game 100 flying tomatoes spitting fireballs out of 100, and now i'm very hungry.",

The maps are wondefully intricate without the need for open world, they are not as confined as some reviewers would lead you to believe. Others have issues with the AI ,to keep this short I will simply say I don't (if you are in a hallway or staircase yes the AI will kind of line up.. obviously). The tons of secrets really justify the maps designs. ( if your Gamma is set properly) they can even be creepy. The Glory kills are repetative but a good addition to the game mechanic.  Ultimately DOOM puts you in that DOOM world with the music, the tempo of the game, the fast pace gamplay, the need to be inquisitive, the crazed demons, DOOM is a well made game, Unlike Rage, Id did DOOM right.",

            "review_text": "Doom 2016 is arguably one of the best games to come out this year, it's not the best but it is definitely one of the better games to come out of 2016.  Pros:  + Constant sales.  Do yourself a favor, you should definitely get this game once it goes on sale, considering how id/Bethesda is being really generous with this game and the constant 50% off sales I'd definitely recommend picking this up when it's on sale.  + Fast paced  I honestly had a lot of trouble playing other games like Overwatch once I finished having a pretty strong marathon with Doom, the movement of other games just felt way too slow so you may or may not experience a hang over if you try to play this game through long sessions and then trying to switch to other games.  + Solid shooting All the guns feel viable and the situations and how you handle them is usually let up to you.  + Interesting lore The game lacks a story, which is fine, this is DOOM. Not Last of Us. However, the lore in the game is actually really rich if you bother searching for the records that are spread throughout the game.  + Music The music in this game is really great and gets you into the mood of killing more and more demons.  + Optimisation on PC is surprisingly good considering how badly PC ports have been handled lately. &gt;_&gt; Watching you NMS, Deus Ex.  Mixed: ~ Death match was finally added into the MP and id has taken over the Multiplayer aspect as well. We're supposedly gonna be getting bots sometime later but unfortunately this stuff wasn't here at launch.  ~ An arguable problem with the game is how the levels are layed out and this may or may not make the game feel too repetitive depending on the player. The usual formula is travel here &gt; Get locked down inside room &gt; Kill demons &gt; Room is unlocked &gt; repeat. This can make the game feel too repetitive if you're not too into it and compared to the old Doom games, you could find and hunt all demons or you could just run through them and only deal with the ones in your way.  ~ Multiplayer. The Multiplayer was handed off to Certain Affinity, the people that did Halo MP so id themselves had no handling over the multiplayer until after the game was released. It's not bad, it's not great, it's just, okay.    Negatives: - Multiplayer DLC my only gripe with this game is that I can't seem to connect with anyone in the MP and the fact that id/Bethesda seem focused on adding Multiplayer DLC only to the bag to a game that's already dead. I've tried, 5 minutes sitting in the MP screen and I couldn't get a single soul.",

(like seriously, i was amazed to see this game reaching max of 130FPS on ultra in hell zones) -I didn't feel totally ripped off buying this game. -The Music is great heavy metal, without freaking growling singers in the background all instrumental. -The game allows you to control the sound effects and music seperately instead of one master volume slider.  Cons -Snapmap is multiplayer based only, Forget being able to carry more then two weapons it wont let you(Please bring us a more single player/Singeplayer co-op based snapmap) -The game doens't start you off with nightmare Difficulty unlocked, idk why they did it that way but they did. -The game for some reason frequently CTD's at specific parts (Still trying to reproduce it on video, it waits until im not recording to crash)  I don't think that I will ever use multiplayer mode until Snapmap is given more proper co-op features ingame but that being said I still very much enjoy returning into the game to redo some of the End story arena survival area's.

Myself and my friend could not get enough, always playing it on the hardest difficulty we could (ultra violence - what do you expect? It was an FPS with a D-Pad!). Years later, I finally get a laptop and the first thing I put in the CD drive? Doom Complete Collection. DOOM 3 comes out. Won't run on my PC, so I get the Xbox version. It's good, but it's not what I wanted.  A few years later, Brutal DOOM comes along. I go through all the classics again, with touched up graphics, and all the fun stuff it added like executions.  Now? Now we have DOOM 2016. From the footage shown I thought I'd like it. What I didn't expect was for the campaign to be as close to perfect as can be managed, taking into account console limitations.  I haven't played much MP, btw. It's like Halo 2, if it had loads of blood and only took place indoors. Snap Map feels a bit half-♥♥♥♥♥, but the limitations are forcing users to be creative and there's fun to be had in there.  The campaign, which I played on Ultra-Violence, though... Well it's DOOM II, modernised. I cannot give it higher praise. Each fight is a masterfully choreographed ballet, each new weapon adding a step to an ever more complicated dance routine. It's almost hypnotic, and it is beautiful in it's own twisted, blood-soaked way.  You need this game in your life. This is what a FPS should be.",

The marine can move awful fast, just like his counterpart from the past. He's got RPGs and a LAW, and even a chainsaw, for when his ammo can't last.  The maps are fun to explore, and the combat is covered in gore. There's lots of verticality, in hell or reality, And there's a double jump- need I say more?  The enemies are massive and scary, and the demons are certainly varied. But the glory kills are done well, to kill the minions of hell, Or you can use the arsenal you carry.

Multiplayer: This is a mixed experiance.I loved the beta experiance but the full version dosen't seem to have grown much. It plays quite like Halo but without health regen.IMO this isn't so much of a negative thing but it feels a little bland at times  The Demons have been weakened a little and are mixed with success as a result.The weapons are all unlocked within the first 14 levels and they don't seem to have any massive issues with balancing at the moment,It just dosen't grip me as well as the Single player does.I would say buy this gae for the Single player experiance,The Public multiplayer is a bonus if you enjoy it.

Now, with the praises aside, let's talk a bit about the game itself. DOOM's gameplay requires a lot of movement, and you have a vast array of weapons to literally mow down demons with. You stop, you  die , plain and simple. Each weapon can be modded, so on top of however many weapons they give you, the mods add even more variety and allows flexibility to different playstyles. I thought this was a neat idea, since you can change how you fight on the fly, leading to different chains. Furthermore, weapons are not restricted to levels or sequences - if you find it, you can use it early.  Which leads me to exploring, which the game encourages you to do with secret rooms and collectibles. I thought how they implemented it struck a good balance between streamlining the maps for the player and avoiding making areas too big. Exploring leads to lots of good lore and backstory on characters, which helps give their motivations during the course of the story clearer meaning, if you choose to pursue it.  The plot itself is, objectively, really generic. A scientist goes mad with power and creates a cult, and you have to basically stop her from literally unleashing Hell. A very standard good v. evil story, but I've found that games like these don't really need a strong story to carry it (though it's always welcome). I think id knows that lots of players will be playing DOOM with the intent of going in to rip-and-tear, and I think how they portrayed Doomguy was perfect in that regard. Doomguy doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥ (mostly) about what's happening at the Mars facility he woke up in. He has one priority: KILL EVERY DEMON. And kill he does - everything from the copious amounts of gore to the pretty sweet glory kills channels this. Plus, the story plays on his indifference to the other characters' goals, leading to some hilarious moments.  Music and art were both top notch. Metal fans (or anybody into heavy guitar riffs) will enjoy the soundtrack, as it uses leitmotifs from the original DOOM score as an homage and base for the new soundtrack. Music channels the frantic nature of the gameplay and satisfying gunplay and kills and complements it, leading to a rise in adrenaline while playing. I thought with all the times we go to Hell that it would look like the same desolate place, but the artists really captured different feelings and made distinguishable environments in a place that pretty much screams its the cesspit of the universe. No place was really boring to look at in DOOM, which made moving around the maps more enjoyable with good level design.  A minor gripe was the boss difficulties. They get steadily harder up until the final boss. While that boss is challenging, I felt like she wasn't as challenging as the previous boss, which led to a slightly disappointing fight in terms of ramping difficulty. Previous bosses made me go 'Well, I'm kind of screwed,' then experience a rush of elation when I beat it (only to find that it wasn't even its final form sometimes). In a game that does a good job making things challenging, that fight just seemed lackluster. Furthermore, the ending itself was lackluster. I didn't expect a perfect ending since the story was only OK, but they literally end it on a cliffhanger, which I didn't quite like. This is a personal thing though, because I felt the end was abrupt, and left me going 'Is that it?' because I was really enjoying DOOM a lot.  Overall, DOOM did an excellent job with fantastic gameplay that feels good to play, and is incredibly polished in this and its visual and audio aesthetics. The story is kind of just there to bridge the fun demon killing sprees, but DOOM is a solid release that does one simple thing and one simple thing well without sacrificing variety and difficulty. There's a demo out, so if you're still unsure, give it a try!",

The campaign is one of the best and freshest shooters I've played in years, and I hope adds new life and dimension into what was getting to be a stale genre.  The level design is almost perfect; scales range from Corridors to enourmous arena's just like they did in the originals.  The minions and weapons are just classic Doom redone. They're familiar yet fresh, and most importantly fun and satisfying.  The soundtrack is epic and adds a tonne to the experiance.  Cons   The levels while laid out and perfect, are perhaps a bit too 'doom by the numbers' in Hell they could have gone a a lot more inventive, but stuck to the classic skulls and wall shackles. Doesn't diminish the game at all, just felt like it was an opportunity lost.  While I appreciated they left the story a massive secondary feature, as is traditional in Doom, they could have maybe spent a bit more flushing out who was who, and what was going on. I got just enough that it made me curious and confused who these characters were and what they're motivations were. Thankfully, if you feel like reading, some of this is explained in codex's you can collect.  The multiplayer - It's really not bad, it's twitchy and fun, if fairly unbalanced. It's quality of the campaign makes the Multiplayer seemed almost tacked on. I put quite a few hours in Beta though before the campaign even launched, and I had a lot of fun.  I know we're not half way through yet, but this will likely be the FPS of the year.  9/10",

To do so, you have an incredible amount of different weapons. You got everything from shotgun to gatling. And if that's not enough, you can finish off enemies with your bare hands. If you look for a game where you get the satisfaction of bashing an enemies head in with his own arm after you ripped the same off, then I recommend you to buy DOOM.

At first I thought I'd not like the 'glory kill' feature, however, as soon as I used it I liked it and it became a natural thing to do in Doom. What else I can say? The gameplay is excellent.  Unlike Doom 3 and like the old-school Doom games the games doesn't try to make you care for the story or the world, but if someone really want to know about it, the game doesn't punish him/her for that; there is a lot of information about it that you can pick up and read in the forms of data logs scattered around each map of the game. They offer interesting information about the places you visit, the enemies you face, the weapons you use and about the characters that this game involves.  This game was incredibly stable, which is rare these days with games being released with ton of bugs and day one patches. It has bugs, like any other game but so far I haven't found a game-breaking one. I don't own a high spec PC, nonetheless I could run the game without problems and with the addition of Vulkan it helped me a lot to increase the performance of this game.  I haven't played the multiplayer part of the game so I can't review it, same for the DLC.  The only let down is that there is no more single player content after you beat the main campaign. Recently a new mode was released to boost that, but if they release a new DLC single player campaign it would be cool and it is was most people is waiting for.

Forget the early critics (based on Multi betas and limited versions) cause this is what we've all been waiting for. F**k Call of Duty, F**k Battlefield, F**k Halo, this is a throwback made with class and respect to the grandaddy of em all, Ultimate DooM (What doom 3 shoulda been imo).   Random Thoughts :  - The solo is really great with a somewhat basic story (nothing more, nothing than what the original doom story was) but terrific game and sound design. Around 8 to 10hours to play through it 100% but there's a high replay value. - It is viewed negatively for being an 'arena fps'. Doesn't every clasic Doom games play as 'arena fps' ' ?? - Movement is the key (just like it used to be.). Game is really frenetic  - Basically emulates the old school DooM with modern gameplay (still very much Horizontal and Vertical at its core) and stunning graphics - Very easy to handle, there's like 4-5 keys (besides moving) to use regularly, the rest are almost useless - controller friendly (Handles great with thhe Steam controller tho you'll need to tweak the Id Preset. Did not play with a xbox pad but should be good too) - Demons are somewhat varied and very well designed - The arsenal is classic (in the ood way) - You can 'feel' the guns (weight, kick,...) - The CQC animations are very brutal - Soundtrack is brutal too, very fitting, timeless and inspired by the original - The Id Tech Engine 6 kicks-a$$ even on low specs (i play on a laptop with a core i7 and a GTX950M and i can run the game on medium to high with absolutely no lag. The game ain't even on my SSD) - Id seems to have mastered the in-game secrets: not too many neither too few + they are fun (like the little marines) - LOOK FOR LEVERS IN EACH LEVELS (If you know why, you won't be disappointed and if you don't know, you will be amazed and will love it). Levers are the crack of this game. - Not sure if it's a port but it's greatly optimised and does not feel like one - The multi is okay even though the gameplay is a litlle bit diluted and messy (the hacks are nice but they feel to much like pay to win or at least to get an edge even if they are very limited and obtainable for free). The snapmap mode is nice fun with friends - Install size is 53 GB so make sure you've cleared some space  Buy it, on sale or not.

Getting suddenly mobbed and blasting until it stops hurting is what doom 1&amp;2 were about, and this offers that, the rate then seemed really fast (remember, doom gave birth to the FOS genre), now? It IS fast.   It also includes loot/leveling aspects that compliment rather than complicate the game. Do I need to shotgun blast 30 imps in the face? No, but I'll do it for the fun, and to get the weapon enhancement.  Which brings me to another interesting point. Many(but not all) characters are readily recognizable from doom I/II, but.. better. Which I really enjoyed.   The bad: It ate my HD6870. The framerate hovered around 24 with passable, but not good graphics, the rendering engine really isn't meant to cater to older hardware. The game's combat engine copes well with lowered framerate, combat slows universally so you don't just get gibbed, but as you'd expect, it damages the pace. Some views were untenable, dropping to 10 or less FPS.  Had to overnight a new card from Amazon, which is pretty typical when a new id game comes out(The purchase, not the overnighting. id has driven much of my PC upgrade process). With the new card I'm getting 100fps consistently and the old school doom 'feel' is0 100%.

Any attempt to replicate that after those times seemed half-hearted and unfulfilling... until now. DOOM is the essence of that genre, made better and amplified.  Positives : - Graphics : It looks amazing. My jaw drops everytime I enter a new Mars level. - Music : MY ♥♥♥♥ING GOD that music!!! BFG Divison melts your faces and takes your virginity. - Art-style : Amplifies the ambience. Completely unapologetic and in-your-face. Blood, guts, gore, GLORIOUS!! - Mechanics : Fast movement, air-strafing, relentless action, no ♥♥♥♥♥footing, no walking, no 'rubber-banding', no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. - Difficulty : Ultra-Nightmare gets pretty difficult, which means it's that much more rewarding to play. Yet, the 'I'm too young' difficulty should allow unexperienced FPS players to enjoy the game to the fullest without being intimidated.   Negatives :  - Multiplayer is underwhelming. The loadout system and levelling-up system undermines it. But I have a feeling they will listen to the feedback and fix it with the big upcoming multiplayer patch. This game absolutely has the potential to be as good as Q3A, it just needs to be unlocked. - The in-game points/upgrade system in single player is annoying, but thankfully, it's completely optional. You can play through the entire game without bothering yourself with them, so this is only a minor gripe. - Single player campaign not long enough. I was sad that I finished the game in roughly 8 hours. I LOVE IT AND I WANT MOAARRR!!  - Expensive season pass just for some multiplayer maps and playable demons(???). Should be free, but I'll reserve judgement for that when it comes out. But once again, it's completely optional.  Verdict : Best single-player FPS game EVER for a certain demographic (myself included) and a 'must play' classic for every other FPS fan. This is THE 10 out of 10 game, the game that all other single-player FPS games will be benchmarked against. Rip and Tear!!!  PS : If you think it's too expensive for ~8 hrs of gameplay, I can somewhat agree but I will say that the game was thorougly utterly satisfying and to me, you can't put a price on that. If you can't buy it at full-price, please do yourself a favour and buy it during one of the sales.",

            "review_text": "  A Loyal Tribute to the old ID Software  , i got the same experience as Doom 1 &amp; 2 while i played this one. This edition makes a nice link between Old Fast Paced FPS &amp; Modern Shooters connecting the 'Non regenerative health, Hardcore Difficulty and Tough Enemies' with the impressive visuals and graphic effects we see on Modern Shooters. Along the campaign i saw a great team behind working on the Single Player which focused on the distinctive style of the previous games; Good Length, Amazing Level Design, Awesome Tech/Optimization (related to idTech 6), Kinesthetics, AI. This game is Great in so many aspects that outshines one of the worst multiplayer modes FOR this kind of Franchise... Yes, it's bad.    Fast, Brutal &amp; Immersive Experience   sounds like the secret recipe of the Doom series, and this one doesn't miss anything... But, i must confess that i expected more of Mick Gordon on the OST, there's something that don't belong to the background music, such as the Slowness of certain tracks, some of these really works on certain levels and ambients (metal/synth tracks), but is not comparable with the old ones.    AI and Animation works flawlessly , the arenas &amp; level design takes the player on a journey where mercy is not allowed, and invites him to 'Rip and Tear' between each demon you see, it doesn't matter if these launches rockets from its arms or shoulders, spits fireballs, or split you in half with their bare hands.  I Think Romero and Carmack should not worry about the franchise because it is in the good hands of Bethesda/Id Software.... EXCEPT; Multiplayer Mode, made by another developer who made Halo Multiplayer. First of all, they implemented several features of console/'modern shooter' that made the fans hate this mode because it doesn't remember at all the style of Doom or even remotely the Quake Gameplay where Arena's were the dominant mode on Lan Party's in the late 90's/early 00's, in these matches each player was tested by skills and don't recompensate losers with 'consumables', Second; The multiplayer mode is so unbalanced with the demon runes which makes the round almost unrecoverable for the team who doesn't have the demon. I must say that i don't hate or disagree on certain multiplayer modes/implementations that are very similar to this one (looking to you Halo), i only say that IT DOESN'T FIT AT ALMOST ALL ASPECTS WITH THE FRANCHISE.  Now... Snapmap is an invitation to make your own maps, but at this time is very limited in various aspects (max demons, objects, space) which is understandable from a hardware perspective, however i would like an improved version of snapmap in the future where these restrictions ends permanently, and developers add new features such new arenas, or even make new ones, mods, script modifications, who knows what else with this great franchise.   The Veredict;   This reboot makes the player feel the original sensation made in '93 at technological, visual and mechanical levels where fast paced action is the main role of the franchise, several ticks of the checklist has been made flawlessly but it's true that is not perfect (OST &amp; Multiplayer), besides that i really appreciated that i preordered the game ever without knowing if Id Software/Bethesda made this title with all the hype and gameplay videos, which is the reason why i preordered it (good one marketing...).  Last note, I grew up with this franchise and PC Gaming, i also love CoD 2 and MW franchise and others. To all other players from different generations; You must play this title, even better if it is on PC.     Excellent Title, BUY IT!      Rip n' Tear out of 5  ",

One of my favorite things about DOOM is how well balanced it is on every difficulty and when playing on Nightmare difficulty, enemies are not bullet sponges. Enemies deal massive damage but the game's mechanics allow you to dispose of them quickly and survive through movement, dodging and stunning. You quickly notice how your gameplay improves when you adapt a more primal go-and-mow playstyle, which for me has been long forgotten after a decade of CoD-like shooters.  I hope more games in the future can reproduce the feeling that id and Bethesda got with this DOOM game. This game single handedly resurrected my desire for FPS games after a decade of stagnation.  If I had to say anything negative about the game, it'd have to be that the Pistol isn't great, the auto-save system is sometimes annoying, I wish the game had COOP so I could go through the SP campaign with friends and the biggest of them all is probably the lack of modding ability. SnapMap is cool, but what kept the original DOOM games alive to this day is the fact people are able to create completely new content.",

I was tentative about this release. This nature has been in play since the dissapointment felt throughout DOOM3 and it's expansion (something about it just didn't sit right - it just wasn't MY DOOM), and the early reviews of this title were far from positive. Something also to note is that I rarely play multiplayer FPS games, so my opinion is based solely on the campaign which is potentially 'missing the point' I'm sure.  I rarely get the time to really pour hours into a title, but after a fairly hairy month at work I had bough an evening to experience one of my old loves - killing demons. All that said, I sat down last night and fired up the game and even from the title screen I had goosebumps. The game iteslf is certainly not perfect, and in the initial levels I had felt like switching it off and coming back to it as the story and gameplay hadn't really gripped me, however in around the third or fourth level the pennt dropped. This game is wonderful, gory, fun, and has a brilliant learning curve and drip-feeds you the mechanics throughout the campaign really well.   The games ability to embed; story, humour, cool mechanics, rapid gameplay and homage to the older titles is great and I can honestly say I enjoyed my experience thoroughly. If you are a fan of the older titles (DOOM and DOOM II in particular) I feel like you might just need to give this a go (and give it a couple of hours, don't quit when you feel it's just not right, give it a little longer, it might surpirise you).  The game made me laugh, scream in fear, think and nigh on break my keyboard it had everything I needed in a fast-paced, demon killfest - oh, and the classic maps are a touch of genius.

This is the main reason I bought the game and it is without question fun and challenging! There are the classic secrets that you'll find when you check out 'Every nook and cranny.' They've also added suit and weapons upgrades that you'll find when you explore. The story is thin, but it's there and it's all you need to KICK-A! The AI is smart, the glory kills are bloody awesome, and music will get your blood pumping!  Second is Multiplayer. There are about 9 game styles. Even if you lose you'll earn XP Experience Points. As you progress up the levels features will unlock. You'll be able to access more Weapons, Equipment, Hack Modules, Loadout Slots, Suit parts, Colors and Patterns. By Level 17 I had all weapons and equipment available. DOOM Multiplayer may not be all that unique or 'original,' but frankly there isn't much to MP games. You run, you shoot, you frag, you try to stay alive. It's still a lot of fun and the maps are cool! Plus you get to play as a Demon! How cool is THAT?  Third is SnapMap, a level/game creation tool. It's relatively easy to use and the possibilities are endless! Tutorials are included, although they don't do an in depth job of explaining the logic/syntax of the system. You'll need learn those to build more complex maps and actions. But there are already dozens of tutorials on YouTube showing how powerful SnapMap can be. There are a couple of limitations. One is that created maps can only handle 4 players total. I hope they increase that to at least 8! The other is that at release there is no outside modding planned. So for example you can't add your own textures or models or sounds. SnapMap is still very cool and I've already played a few dozen maps.  Overall the graphics look great with lot's of sharp detail. Even on a modest graphics card, like my GeForce GTX 750 Ti, it plays smoothly and looks incredible! The game play is fast and bloody! I Highly Recommend it.  Dood, it's DOOM!",

My Doom Career started in '93 and lasts today, still mapping, playing, etc.   This game is good. Combat is very addicting and you're always moving. A few slips and you're knee deep in death. The Graphics are fantastic, vibrant colors, many things happening at once. I love every monster design besides the CyberMoose, the one demon they couldn't possibly screw up they did and modeled him into a weird half-tard Moose (SPOILER) that you only encounter once. (SPOILER)   I was on the fence about Glory Kills and Arenas but after beating the game twice they're nicely done and complement combat very well. It's similar to a Serious Sam but more Doom. The stuff I miss from Classic is monster closets and a little more open-ended map layouts, but what's here is still better than anything we've gotten in years. Weapon mods feel fluffy and it seems design time could have maybe better spent elsewhere, Doom's always been about combat and quick heel &amp; toe work.  Certain Affinty developed Multiplayer so you're getting a weird mix of Halo and COD, but neither of the two. It has no real identity, it's not bad, it's not great. I was hoping they'd revive skill-based MP with things like item control, timing etc, but that's just not the case, especially from a gang of hacks like Certain Affinty. There's a weird flip-flop here where the Singleplayer requires the skill Multiplayer should have but doesn't. So if you like Singleplayer shooters this is the one to get.  SnapMap is good but prefabs suck, along with console limitations. It's good for combat, though, and that's all I really care about.

This is an interesting game, It sorta feels like a blend between Doom 3 and the originals...In a good way. The awkward to read maps are there, the cool weapons and nice looking monsters are there.  For me currently the only thing that is dragging this down is that the world isn't feeling alive; more like every monster is waiting for Doom Guy to arrive in the next area (Sorta DMC or Bayonetta style.) Kill them and search then move on. The original Doom games had a 'Level' Feel and exploring them was a treat! My MAJOR criticism is that the music is just nothing!! Remember the original Doom soundtrack? Based on Pantera and gnarly music. This game just has some ambient BS and some teasing of the original music. TIP just play the original soundtrack in the background or some metal of your choice and turn the in game music to 0 (Now it's better isn't it?)  All in all 6.5/10 currently. A fun game for 12 hours but isn't going to win any awards. Hardcore Doom fans should pick it up just for the nostalgia. New fans just get the original 2 games if you want to enjoy a great FPS.  Edit- After making it a little further this is a decent game. Probably a 7.5/10 The levels have become a lot more intricate although the arena style is still an issue. I would say the best way to enjoy this game is in two playthroughs though. The first time go through and just shoot things in the face and then wait until you play it again (which you probably will.) to find all the secrets. Espcially considering some of the areas behind you lock off??? This makes exploring the first time frustrating. Treat this like the first game, plug in .... turn the music up, play and enjoy.",

They aren't the smartest enemies you faced in a game from this genre, but they are definetely extremely fun to fight against in massive numbers.  Just like your protagonist, this game doesn't give a single ****. Pretty much every overused and unfun standard in modern videogames is thrown out through the airlock. Screw weapon limit, screw regenerating health, screw over-exposed story with characters as uninteresing as a random trash can. It only keeps the progression and upgrade systems, but in this game it's well executed and upgrades you get from it are substantial and game-changing.  If you like mad, uncontrollable, sadistic and extremely satisfing experience, give it a shot. Pun intended.",

Controls are fluid, the graphics are excellent when playing this on ultra, and enemy executions are set a good pace so it doesn't slow down the action.  Multiplayer is good for what it is. Obviously it was met with some controversy due to adopting some modern features and straying away from what DOOM is suspose to be but really, I just see it as something that's a bonus. Multiplayer isn't doing too much that's as different as many shooters on the market and it's not what some of us expected when it comes to DOOM multiplayer. It's just kind of there. A love or hate kind of thing really.  Overall, I'd reccomend it alone for it's singleplayer as It's why a bought it in the first place and it hasn't let me down.

The combat is extremely fluid, brutal and fast paced with weapons that feel right with one exception being the combat shotgun which is a bit underwhelming. There are secrets hidden throughout the lvels such as item dumps like health and ammo and collectibles. Cutscenes are few and far between and the game handles them like half lifes interactive custcenes where you can still look and sometimes walk around while a character dumps exposition, luckily these only happen about 5 times throughout the game. The music is also incredible and as I was dissapointed at first that it wasnt complete metal however it is a wonderful mix of industrial sounds mixed with guitar riffs and drums that goes perfectly with killing demons in 2016. I dont really care about the multiplayer or snapmap but to me this game is worth it just for the singleplayer alone which is what DOOM is known for. I give it 9 colored keycards out of 10 dismembered torsos. The game also runs great on a gtx 970 with everything maxed at 1080p, hovering between 70 and 110 fps.",

Despite my negative initial impression, I decided to take the plunge and bought the game on release.   I'm glad I did! This feels like a DOOM game - keeping traditional elements such as fast-paced action, monsters, and weapons, while taking advantage of modern developments today. The combat feels fantastic; at first I thought the gore kills were gimmicky, especially when I saw other people play it. In fact, it doesn't just feel great ripping a demon apart, it adds to the gameplay and keeps it unique; most modern FPS want you to take cover and reload. Not DOOM. It encourages you to dive into a demon mosh pit by ripping them apart so you get more ammo and health!   The game also makes good use of weapon upgrades, allowing them to be used in different ways for multiple battle scenarios. Although the format of combat gets repetitive, it always feels fun. Also, upgrades to both weapons and your marine are optional - if you want to play it without them for a greater challenge, go right ahead! The multiplayer is basic and pretty uninspiring (perhaps it will get better in the future), but DOOM is all about the single player experience and modding community!   I admit I am a DOOM fan boy. The original DOOM is one of my favorite games of all time and I have enjoyed all the others (including Doom 3 and Doom 64).

This game brings back the running and gunning that has been long forgotten. But allows for weapons upgrading and more.

The way each gun feels and sounds to shoot, the amount of ammo you have, the rate at which you acquire new guns and modifications for existing ones is the perfect balance to prevent you getting bored. -Excellent level design. Some really fun to traverse combat arenas littered with pick-ups and secrets as well as large open levels with multiple paths to your objectives. -Excellent soundtrack and sound design. I even went and bought the soundtrack seperately when it was released. -Very impressive graphically. Had some issues running it on an older PC that just scraped the minimum specs but on a newer machine with everything cranked up it's an amazing game to behold. -Cool enemy design. I mean that both in terms of aesthetically and mechanically. Each demon, even the regular posessed humans look terrifyingly awesome. Add to that solid AI that forces you to adapt your playstyle and weapon choices to whatever combination of enemies you're fighting, and it makes for a fun time. -The multiplayer is solid. As with seemingly most people it wasn't exactly what I wanted (basically a modern Quake Live but shinier and more extreme) it is still an enjoyable game to play online on the whole with some decent game modes and cool levels.  The bad: -Unfortunately the multipler still isnt great. The absence of a deathmatch mode for the longest time was a big negative. The weapon balancing, at least the last time I played it, was also total garbage. Depending on which level you're playing you can almost guarantee what weapon eberybody will be using. For example playing this game just after launch and in the beta, the majority of people on each team would be running round with a rocket launcher and super shotty because they were the most effective combination on most maps.  -Enemy variety. There are a realitvely high number of different enemies in the game. Unfortunately several of them are essentially re-skins of existing ones with changes to their abilities so slight it makes little to no difference as you wade through them. For the final few levels after you've seen all the regular demon types that aspect began to get a bit monotonous. 'Gee whizz another 2 floating eye dudes and a couple revenants, just like that fight 10 minutes ago.' -Too many secrets/collectibles. From what I can recall there are preator tokens, argent cores, doomguy toys, codex files, audio logs, classic doom levels and just general 'secrets'. I enjoyed exploring the levels in this game but that's just too much. And while it's good that you're rewarded for finding them, what's not good is accidentally finishing a level only to find that you missed half the stuff and the only way to get them is to replay the whole thing. -The biggest blue-balls ending to a game since Halo 2. No spoilers but if like me you think cliffhangers are cheap and lazy then you will hate the ending as much as I did.  Overall the gameplay carries it though to be one of the best single player FPS Ive played in years.",

I also would like to add... if you want to see your sister freak out, die a 1000 times by falling to her death and running for her life rather than shooting things then this is definitely the game for you.   If you played any Doom game before then it will be a bit dissapointing, its not as scary as it used to be , back then you had your gun and a torch but you could only use one at a time it made you ♥♥♥♥ yourself during the game because you could either see the deamon and not be able to kill it or you could kill it but cannot see it, it was one of those games where you only play during the day and hug yourself at night, but for first time players it will be awesome i think",

I understand if there is a lot of them, but this happens when there is like, one or two left.

Unfortunately, It doesn't look like ID has changed much of anything from the beta. The complaints regarding the weapon load outs, unbalanced weapons, and just about everything else went largely ignored. I'm not sure the developers would have had enough time to salvage the multiplayer, though. One huge complaint I have for the multiplayer is the fact that you cannot use text chat outside of being in the actual multiplayer game. In other words, you can't use text while being in the waiting room or in the respawn screen. Not everybody has a microphone and not everybody enjoys using one either. Everybody playing this game on PC, however, has a keyboard. Also, what's with the wait times for multiplayer? It seems like you're spending more time waiting for the actual match to start up than you are actually playing the match! This awful multiplayer aside, the singleplayer is largelyh enjoyable. The game controls great, it has a nice sense of speed, and its pretty challenging too. The graphics are pretty good, outside of some minor complaints regarding texture issues. The load times are pretty unbareable, especially if you're not a master at the game and find yourself being defeated by the demon beasts often. At this moment in time I can recommend the game, but only for the single player aspect. If you're looking for a fun multiplayer game, wait for Overwatch to be released or play something else that you know is good.",

Trust me i got my fill of the multiplayer and wont be visiting it again except for snapmap.    This game is everything i wanted it to be. The fluid fast combat, the guns feeling great and beefy except for the pistol which is fine. The glory kill system is a welcome new comer, it doesnt break up the flow of combat at all and is needed if you need health in a pinch. You have to be aggressive and fast when fighting the hordes of hell cause they will kill you quickly and with efficency.   Oh and the music is some the dirtiest, grindiest, and heaviest metal/electronic music Ive ever heard. If any of this sounds awesome to you then what are you waiting for? Dive into hell Supershotgun barrels first and blast your way through some demons.   By the way the demons, oh my god are they awesome. The variety alone is huge and they come at you in massive hordes. My favorite is the Baron of Hell XD. id Software did a great job going back to what made Doom revolusionary, and they did an amazing job. Now granted it's not perfect, no games is. There were a few times that I felt the pacing could have been handled better but not a real gripe. There is dialogue and alittle story sprinkled on top of this gory and very fast paced game but it takes a big back seat to the gameplay.

So anytime you reach a relatively large area there will be an item you need to interact with and a bunch of frequently spawning enemies that need to be taken out before proceeding. It's pretty much the same for the entire game; some easy to beat enemies might be lying on the path as you get from A to B but many of these are really easy to beat and can be melee'd to death.   As for the platforming from A to B, it's pretty well done for a first person title. Most of the platforming is grabbing onto ledges rather than making precise jumps onto small platforms. You jump and face a ledge, and the game gives some leeway with this so that it doesn't have to be PRECISE jumps and timing. And that's a plus, because this isn't a platformer it's an FPS title with platforming elements. It's nothing too heavy and it works fine.  Along the way there are a lot of explorable areas. Small nooks to get into and get upgrades and/or unlock classic Doom levels. The maps are large enough to have a minimal amount of exploratory elements to them, but nothing massive. This isn't Metroid Prime.  There's a plot in there but it's pretty sh*t and no one cares for it. I don't understand why writers create plots but never bother to think, 'is this rational? Would an actual living human being with a regular IQ do this?''. That has always irritated me; I can suspend disbelief but when a file tells me that, ''we let this creature power himself but kept him effectively braindead whilst creating him; in retrospect it was a bad idea letting him power himself cause he just got out of the braindead state by powering himself''. What? These ARE scientists of high caliber, right? Where'd they get their degrees, Trump University?  Anyway it got pretty formulaic for me towards the end and there was nothing to draw me in to finishing it quickly. It's got good production values and is generally above average, but pretty formulaic. The environments are pretty to look at, even though it's all brown as ♥♥♥♥. Even hell is brown.  I came into this game with no preconceived notions as to what a Doom title should be like or what the previous games were like. So take this review from the perspective of someone that came in fresh into it. Personally I liked The New Order better since there was more depth to the experience, but this game is alright. The devs didn't fu*k up and it was a good experience, albeit nothing astounding here it still got the job done. Get it for...you know, I'd say 40 bucks or less since there's actually a lot here.",

            "review_text": "This is a true return to the olden days. DOOM is back with all the gory and glory of destroying demons. The whole package is well worth the price. To be honest the single player alone is worth the asking price.   DOOM’s single player is one of the best in recent memory. It truly trumps any FPS single player campaign of the new generation. There is no hand holding here. When you start you are thrown right into the action shooting demons right away. The progression and pacing is spot on and there is very little exposition and story here. You can find out more about the story through pda data. On the easier difficulties it can be too easy so I recommend starting out with the hardest difficulty you can. Once you beat it you can play on the highest difficulty and then you will have quite a challenge. There are a lot of secrets to be found and challenges to complete. You can also upgrade your armor and weapons and it is integrated in it seamlessly. But if you don’t like all the upgrades you can play it thru without upgrading anything and then you can have an extra challenge. The single player is truly a throwback to the old days.  Now then you have two more modes. First snap map. In snap map you can create your own levels. There are a lot of tutorials to help you get acquainted with the ins and outs. Creating levels is quite easy yet a little bit limited. But there are all kinds of options to create your own custom game modes for multiplayer to creating coop missions and single player maps. I am sure creative individuals will be creating quite the contend to keep you going back playing more of DOOM.  And then there is the multiplayer. Now the multiplayer is more akin to the olden arena shooters, but with modern tropes like loadouts and progression. The progressions is quite nice and for the most part you unlock cosmetics and at the beginning the weapons. All of the weapons you will unlock pretty quickly. The multiplayer is fun and hectic. But it’s not as good as the single player or snap map. It’s kind of in the middle. It’s definitely not the reason to buy DOOM. There is also a season pass for multiplayer content. But am not so sure the multiplayer will be relevant for long so it’s not really worth buying. Overall the multiplayer is casual fun but don’t expect it to hold you for long. And even tho the game isn’t long out there are already cheaters. And there is no anticheat system or anything so the cheaters ruin it just like every PC multiplayer game out there. The DLC season pass is also disappointing as it only includes multiplayer content.",

That rush of adrenaline as you slam on your mouse and keyboard harder and harder, and you struggle to come out on top. THAT is what DOOM is like. This is not a CoD reskin where you can hide behind cover for a couple of seconds and regenerate all your health. This is a frantic, raw shooter game where there aren't any gimmicks that help you play, like auto-aim or regenerating health. Whether you live or die depends on your skill, and not if the dice happen roll in your favor.  There are two main components to most games: gameplay and story. Some games are mostly focused on story. Tales from the Borderlands for example. Others are more of a mixture, like Mass Effect or Half Life. DOOM is a primarily gameplay focused experience, with short snippets of story in between long bouts of gunplay. This is not to say that the story in DOOM is bad; it is very good and interesting and you can read up on the lore if you so desire. The point is that DOOM doesn't try to force-feed you story; it tries to keep the gameplay in the spotlight, but provides tools for reading up on lore if you want.  For a game like DOOM, with a large campaign and a 60 dollar price tag, replayability is a very important thing for me. I'd say that DOOM has a medium-high replayability value, for a couple of reasons. First, people are afraid that the game will get repetitive because of the cycle of run, shoot, kill, that you will often find yourself in. However, in my experience, this is not the case; with the constantly changing environments, variety of enemies, many weapon options, and challenges unique to each level, I never found myself getting bored. Secondly, the game has FIVE difficulty settings, ranging from 'I'm too young to die' to 'Ultra-Nightmare,' where if you die, your playthrough is over. The only thing that will get repetitive in DOOM is some of the story dialogue, but only after you've played the game through several times.  Overall, I think that DOOM 2016 is an amazing game where the story may get old, but the GAMEPLAY never will.",

            "review_text": "There are two shooters on the market now. You got OVERWATCH a game that is just inodated with gimmicks and heroes begging for immediate satisfaction for just logging into the game. Nowadays games like overwatch, modern halo and COD are just following the same formulas over and over again. They seem to just take what people in general like in order to cater to the widest demographic and earn the most cash. Overwatch has everything a typical Modern FPS has today, and I can sum it up in a few tags: MOBA, High Mobility, Story. Now that is not to say story is bad, it's neat to have stories for all of your playable characters, but when that is the main point of contention which is what most games nowadays follow, the gameplay is discarded. And that is what games like overwatch is, we have seen it, and its been done before, it's core gameplay is so bland that it needs to ♥♥♥ all these 'heroes' and classes and playstyles in order to stay fresh. Trust me if overwatch was a barebones shooter it would not get the praise it gets now, and its a ♥♥♥♥in shame, its a ♥♥♥♥in shame that people are buying into this focus group driven dribble and are forgetting what makes games so fun. Its not tracer's ♥♥♥ its the gunplay. And that's where doom comes in.  Before I start this review I just want to say. If you are fed up of modern shooters and are looking for a game that you enjoy because the gameplay and mechanics are fun and interesting then DOOM is the game for you.  Doom is humble, even if it may not seem like it. Doom knows it's game play rocks, and it knows that it works. Because ID understands that what makes a good game is fun and interesting gameplay all the customization and Tracer bullcrap comes later, its extra. And Im glad to say that DOOM and Id software did not forget that. It is clear that ID focused on refining the movement, map flow and gunplay of the game and that is why it is so good now. And this can be seen within the multiplayer, this is the first game I have played ibn YEARS where I have gotten a reason to use every single gun. All the guns are usuable. The gameplay is simplistic and eacy to catch on, but it is mastering the movement and pickups that make you the better player.  Baiscally DOOM has pristine gunplay. But ID goes even father than that. They add a fantastic campagain, a glorious plethora of customization features and innovations and most importantly great visuals that can be enjoyed by even lower end PC users. This is how you make a game, you establish a foundation and then add all the flair. And DOOM is a game that understand this to the letter. It has been years. It doesnt need 300 heroes to make it fun, the map design handles that. It doesnt need a hige controversy, the gunplay handles that. A simple game about managing pickups and beating the living ♥♥♥♥ out of people is more complicated than it seems. And honestly if you are stuck between buying blizzards overwatch and DOOM, get DOOM on G(Two)A. Its now like 52$ CDN and I guarantee you wou will get a more satisfying and rewarding experience than you will ever get on that modern overwatch focus group trash.  Now I wish I can boast about it. I really can, but this is someone who came from the campagain. The campagain was perfect. Litterally ZERO flaws. By far the best campagain I have ever played and just the single player along was worth the 52CDN i paid.  The multiplayer on the otherhand, is casual. But for someone looking for an experience similiar to the original DOOM games its utter garbage. I dont know who the ♥♥♥♥ designed the multiplayer but who ever did deserves to get fired. the Customization, taunts, etc were perfect. If DOOM would have stuck to it's original formula in the multiplayer gameplay, it would have easily trumped overwatched and be crowned shooter of the year. But it's not, loadouts are a thing and the Chaingun and super shotty are the meta. You got the armor system that gives way to much damage resistance to the user. I would put 4 Supper shotties and a nade point blank and still not get the kill sometimes. Mind you I wtill want armor to be a vital part of the game but as it stands now it's just a contest of who can put the chain gunon and pick up the most armor first. This would work if DOOM was a game where all of thre weapons are pickups but they are not. and because of that DOOm is not a traditional FPS. It is in the campagain whihc you should get it just for that. But If you are planning on buying doom for its multiplayer, turn around and run away.   Unless ID software and Bethesda grow some balls and stay true to what DOOM should be then this game will jsut be known for its flawless campagain and its Multiplayer will be hushed and forgotten.",

One of the most fun games I've ever played. You'll see an odd review here or there that's sour because it doesn't stay true to the DOOM franchise, but the real question is - who cares? I mean, honestly...play this game for 10 minutes and you'll realize you made the correct decision in picking this up.  The campaign is quite long, actually, which is a huge bonus. And its replay value is extremely high, given that it is nearly impossible to pick up all of the secrets/collectibles and complete all of the mission challenges on the first playthrough without using a guide. Not only that, but the campaign offers 5 different difficulty levels (including a perma-death difficulty which has never appealed to me), so you can play it casually or you can challenge yourself. The game can become really frantic and challenging, and getting through some of the later battles is exhilirating. You are also offered a wide variety of weapons, and can carry all of them at once, with NO reloading necessary...so swapping between weapons mid-battle just adds to the chaos.  And after ALL OF THAT...you STILL have two other features - Snapmap and multiplayer. Snapmap is a mode where players can create their own maps/scenarios, either solo or multiplayer, co-op, PVP, whatever you'd like...and post them for community play. It's quite amazing and pretty easy to use. I haven't utilized it too much to this point, and I don't see myself actually making a map in the near future, but it basically offers unlimited playability of community-submitted content.  The multiplayer is also fun, although I've only put a couple of hours into it at this point. Hard to say if the PVP has any staying power, but I don't see any compelling reason why it wouldn't. The gameplay is fun, fast, and furious...being able to power up mid-game as a demon is pretty awesome, and there are multiple gametypes and maps to satiate the masses.   I think the campaign is reason enough to buy this game, but adding in Snapmap and multiplayer makes it an incredible bargain. Absolutely worth $60, but obviously you can get it for less. I picked it up for $25 and I think it's one of the best deals I've ever gotten on a game. 10/10",

Then DOOM 3 came out and I got that for the XBOX and I enjoyed it a bit more than old DOOM titles because it was (to me) scary. It had this fear factor in it that just made the game more fun for me, entering the dark room and hearing snarls and growls made my hair stand up! also DOOM 3 was a much slower pace game than the old titles. Now DOOM comes out, the developers decided to go back to the old roots and make the game much more fast paced. The fear factor is gone because you are playing as a BADASS PSYCHO OUT OF HELL; THE DOOM MARINE. Right off the bat the second this game starts you are bashing faces against walls, throwing laptops halfway across the room. In this game there is no such thing as 'press E to interact' no its 'press E TO SMASH THE EVER LOVING ♥♥♥♥ OUT OF THIS BUTTON/DOOR/ROBOT/VENT etc..' I just beat the single player which is why I bought this game, it did not disappoint at all. Story was interesting but let’s face it this game was meant for one thing KILL EVERYTHING THAT MOVES. I got all with exception of 3 achievements for the SP and I beat it on second to last difficulty which is why it took me almost 28 hours to beat the campaign and for the $35 I paid for this game it was well worth it, I’ll be going back to replay this on hardest difficulty later to unlock the last 3 achievements. This game is best played if you actually go and explore every nook and cranny on each map to find the secrets because it’s fun that way and the developers went out of their way to make them so take advantage of everything this game offers. Multiplayer I played a few games but it did not interest me, it’s just there for Bethesda to cash in on season pass and the fools that purchased it, other than that it’s a mediocre MP game at best; fast paced, no health regen, playable monster spawns and all that.

DOOM does something that other shooters don't do nowadays, and that is I feel powerful, I have to use my reflexes, but I can still die easily. The guns are brutal, my character is capable, and the only thing I am limited by is my skill. Furthermore, the addition of the Bezerk, Quad-damage buff, ect durring large sequence breaks up the same-ole'. DOOM is unremorseful about what it is, it is a statement towards a generation of watered down games that seem ashamed of what they are. DOOM is violence, and violence against evil.

Like Mortal Kombat!  -Weapons that have their own distinct 'Oomph!' to them. The upgrades are cool, too. -Mick Gordon's (who also did music for Killer Instinct and the latest Wolfenstein games) hard-hitting soundtrack, to which you can bang your head to whilst banging demons' heads on walls or with their own limbs.    Campaign  -The Demons aren't ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. They look awesome, intimidating, and don't  EVER  let up. Unless, of course, you're on 'I'm Too Young To Die' mode.  -Story is kept to a minimum, and whatever exposition is shown to you can sometimes be played through instead of just strapping you there to watch in boredom. Otherwise, it's all there when you press the Tab button and go over to the database.   Multiplayer  -Multiplayer will kick your ♥♥♥ if you're not careful.  -But multiplayer is so fast-paced, so who the ♥♥♥♥ even has time to be careful? All you gotta do is kill anyone in your way. -Getting the Power Weapons, Power-Ups (i.e. Invisibility, Quad Damage), or Demon Rune results in quite a bit of carnage.  -Taunts are very quick, but humorous.   SnapMap  -You can basically do anything you want, including naming a Hell Knight 'Bob the Gate Keeper'.   -Side Con: You can't see the name when you play the level. -There's a whole selection of other people's levels that you can play on so that you can get inspiration.  Cons: -Some glitches are bound to happen in new releases.   That's including at the very end when you fight the last boss and it doesn't die even when its health has run out.   -Being on the receiving end of the Demon Rune or Power Weapons. Same goes for people with Quad Damage or Invisibility.  -The developers considered having players be able to put the Cyberdemon in their SnapMaps, but they axed that idea. Also, the SnapMaps can only have so much stuff on them.   666/666 would slit a Pinky's throat with his own tusk again.",

I haven't played multiplayer at this point, just the single-player campaign.  I'm going to keep it brief.  Pros:  - While playing you feel the chaos of enemies surrounding you, and there's realistic chance you will die - Gun fights are fun - Boss fights are fun: you have to use your brain - Completing optional miniquests within each level allow you to upgrade your weapons sooner - Each gun has 1-2 modifications which, when fully upgraded, have a miniquest which unlocks a special upgrade of your weapon; these are really fun to unlock, completely optional, and not always easy - Exploration yields rewards, but it isn't totally necessary, which makes it more appealing - Glory kills are fun, and rewarding - Chainsaw kills are even more fun, and even more rewarding  Cons:  - Loading times could be a little slow - I wanted more! The campaign took me 19 hrs  Overall: Great game. If you love FPS' and have the disposable income, get it now. If not, your experience won't be tarnished by picking it up on sale in a year or two.

This has been some of the most fun I've had with an FPS in years! I think it's a brilliant reimagining of the original DOOM, which I played countless hours of. If you're a DOOM veteran, I think it would be difficult for you NOT to appreciate this game. All the original enemies make a return in a glorious fashion. Some enemies even share the death animations of the original DOOM (updated for modern times, of course). The enemy AI is incredibly well done. They're tough as hell, but absolutely fair. They pursue you relentlessly. You really can't stand still in this game, or you're toast. But because it's so fast paced, that means you're constantly blasting enemies, switching guns, chainsawing for ammo, jumping on platforms, etc. I've literally exclaimed 'holy ♥♥♥♥' countless times while playing, due to the intensity  There are so many little easter eggs and hidden things in this game that it can take you hours to 100% a level. I've put 33 hours so far and I still have a few levels left, I estimate it'll be around 44 hours before I finish it. I felt that modern id really has created this as an homage to old id, and they did a great job.  With that being said, it has its flaws:  1. Glory kills are really, really wonky. Some challenges require you to perform glory kills in a certain way, and no matter how hard I try to do them, it seems impossible. I think they could use some work. With that being said though, they're still really fun to execute, and a necessary part of survival in DOOM  2. From watching videos/trailers/etc, I got the impression that you could be attacked at any moment. However, this isn't the case, and you can always tell when a fight is about to occur. Takes a little bit away from the suspense. Not a dealbreaker, though.  Those are the only flaws I can think of.  TL;DR: If you're an avid id/DOOM fan, buy this game. It's masterful and some of the most fun I think you'll have with a video game in years!",

This newest iteration of Doom managed to preserve its fast-paced, badass feel that made me fall in love with this franchise all over again. I really felt Doom 3 kinda stuck you in the position of taking things slow and strategizing your movements, leaning more on story and adopting the horror genre that was very popular at its time of release. Everything about this game is love-letter homage to the floppy disk original -- equipped with modern, polished and very immersive graphics, the inception of the Glory Kill (enough said), weapons upgrades and secondary options, incredible level design, grappling mechanics that allow you to reach high ledges and more. Bethesda does an amazing job with the level design and strategically placing enemy spawn points to always keep you on your toes. This is NOT the game where you dig in behind cover. Actually there's very little by way of cover, and if you want to survive, you have to run head-first into the demon hordes. This game is fast, it's in your face, it's everything it was back in 1993 save for the floppy diskettes. Now for the setbacks:  1. No local LAN/co-op 2. No private game mode 3. 6-player maximum party online  So, if you're looking for a good LAN party game, Doom has sadly exited that arena. We had set up a LAN party for release night. We had to split up into 3 parties and could not all play together. Doom was the game that introduced me to LAN parties! Sad to see it go! Wonder how they're going to adjust this for official competitive gaming?  All in all, single player is a wonderfully-emersive experience. Doom purists will certainly be more than satisfied. I certainly was, and new gamers will undoubtedly go into this iteration of Doom experiencing the feel and the spirit of the original.",

Outstanding audio, music and special vocal effects. Nice and long campaign, fantastic bang for the buck. (I didn't even try multiplayer yet) Outstanding graphics, artwork and 'environments'. Weaponry, weapons upgrading, the Praetor Suit thing...well just about everything in this game is awesome. Truly a work of art and technical expertise.   If you like PFS games, if you liked Doom 3 and Quake 4 (both of these were very good for their era), then you should really feel impressed by this iteration of Doom. Like challenges? Then this is it for you. Even the default difficulty can be very challenging for the average, ordinary player in the 'big fights'. Elite players may not think it so challenging, but there are few of these players actually. Most players are solid in their skills, even though they are not top tier. Whatever level you feel you are at, you will become a lot better player after this game. Because you will forced to improve at fighting while moving continuously, you will probable get better at the standard FPS Deathmatch, like the new COD BO3...seriously.   As the game progresses the fights get tougher. Like the reviews have said, keep moving or die! You simply cannot stay still much at all. Run and gun all the way. Fortunately the game is such that there is a very good balance of increasing challenges and weapon-Praetor Suit upgrades that keep the fighting in balance. You get to choose the nature of every upgrade to suit your style. There are plenty of choices. The last few missions have some very tough final fights, even on the default difficulty. Especially that last two missions. The 'boss' demons are challenging enough that many players will probably check out a youtube video to see how they're supposed to play the mission ending.  Then there are the 'Rune Challenges'. These are not necessary to play the game, but if you succeed in each challenge there is a reward in powerups, weapon enhancements and such that help the player handle the fighting a bit easier.   I honestly believe that the 'replayability' of this new Doom iteration is higher than anything I have ever owned. You could try playing at the next higher difficulty than default, or try different Praetor Suit configurations and weapon configurations. Maybe just replay your favorite battles and missions, or even only do the Rune Challenges for a quicky before you go to work. The Rune Challenges are actually hard enough that everything needs to be done just right to succeed.  All in all this is an exceptional fine game. I had zero glitches on the first play through on the default difficulty. The initial release is quite polished, probably more than any other FPS I've ever played...and I've played them all going all the way back to FarCry 1. Many awards await this new Doom.  At the initial $60, it's worth every penny. ANY sale pricing is a steal, litterally. You can't go wrong with this guys.  My comp specs might help in the enjoyment and emersion as I have a very strong computer. Corei7 4790K, 32 GB DDR 3 at 2400 Mhz, EVGA Nvidea GTX 980 SC, Asus Z97-A MB, NEC monitor playing at 1920 x 1200 resolution using the games chosen video recommendations, which it cranked up quite abit. A super nice headset SteelSeries Siberia Elite rounds out the show. The SteelSeries headset sound is absolutely incredible, so my game emersion as far as sound effects go is outstanding. I highly recommend playing this game with a high end headset to take advantage of the incredible work that Id and Bethesda did on the audio in this game.   Thank you Id and Bethesda, great job! This one will go down as one of the very best FPS of all time.",

            "review_text": "Ok, for everyone wondering whether to buy Doom 2016 or not: I have completed the SP and I will not spoil anything, but it is in some sense of the word a remake of the original Doom (1), so in case you where wondering about the 'story'.  tl;dr: its a good, solid, fast shooter with more under the hood that you might think.  Speaking of which: there is some very thin story running in the background just to tie set pieces (and 'objectives' - and I use this term extremely very lightly here - together). In the end, save for one or two rooms maybe this game will throw you into one arena after another and pit you against an increasingly difficult monster mix. Rinse and repeat. Sounds boring? It definitely should be and I can see how this formula can overstay its welcome, But the game manages to keep the action itself extremely interesting. For one: shooting stuff in Doom is extremely fun. The Weapons feel right and powerful, the enemies react well, you get a good sense of damage. It just works, the people who made this game knew how to make it work. The other part are the arenas and how tactics work in the world of Doom. The action is very offensive, fluid and fast paces. I you ever played Quake 3 you will get flashbacks, since it is not rare that you make some cool acrobatics just to hit that one target just right and it all fits together perfectly. As for the tactics: there is a lot of that here. Just running in blindly will get you killed, especially in the later fights. Using the territory to your advantage and especially making use of the glory kills for health, sometimes ammo or armor and also to save that one bullet, or getting in that one chainsaw takedown for ammo is crucial for survival. Since all this has to do with the enemy placement and enemy (re-) direction, these kills do not slow down the action, but reward you for risky maneuvers in sticky situations. Its a fluid, organic part of the gameplay and works extremely well as a complete package. It also forces you to make good weapon decisions. Not splattering that one imp with a rocket, but instead going for a glory kill, because you a low on health, or even saving him for an easy glory kill later on when you might be low on health or ammo is the stuff that you need to think about and that the game will teach you. Resource management is what its all about and this makes even the pistol a essential part of your armory even in later stages. Ammo is spread out juuuuust right, so that you cannot blast your way through everything with just one gun, but need to change up your tactics according to the situation, enemy type and ammo available. To change up the pace a bit, there are many, many hidden secrets. Some extremely well hidden, others a bit more obvious, but its always rewarding. be it a Doomguy Chibi-style collectible, or a mega health and armor, exploration is rewarded and will make you keep your eyes peeled at all times. Finally, there are challenges for each stage that will reward you with weapon upgrade points. This will make you try out different stuff in the levels and go for risky kills in heat of battle. Sadly, most of the upgrades don't feel like much and in the end, I simply left that part out, since all weapons where almost completely upgraded already and there are simpler ways of getting weapon points. Is Doom difficult? Well, it certainly is no Dark Souls, but the difficulty can ramp up, and I did have my fair share of deaths. I would not call it hard though, but the later battles on higher difficulties will most probably be a challenge for some people.  So, while on the outside, Doom is just one arena fight after the other, there is a lot more to it than you might see at fist glance. The game is just long enough to not overstay its welcome, but it is on the edge. the final few battles where already borderline tedious, since there are no new enemies or weapons and you start seeing the same situations a couple of times over. All in all it was a blast blasting my way through Hell and back, but before I even think about touching Snap-Map I need a break.",

            "review_text": "Now that I have gotten all achievements and have completed the game 100%, I feel like I can leave an accurate review. Let's break it down just like the main menu does.  Campaign  Positives: Some might say it was short, but if you go searching for secrets and challenges they you can end up sinking quite a bit of time on the levels. The combat was very fluid and tearing an imp's face in half is really satisfying. There are plenty of glory kills to experience as well, so approaching from different angles just to see how they die was a real time sink of mine. (Another time sink was just looking at the scenery, especially in outdoor levels.)  Bosses were actually really well done. You need to see attack patterns and dodge, attack when the time is right, and when you do, attack hard. Glory kills on bosses were well worth the effort of the fight, too.   The best part of campaign is that when you find a classic doom map secret (there is 1 per level) you unlock the full level to play on the new engine from the campaign menu.  Overall the campaign was gorgeous and really fun to play. It is the crowning achievement of the title hands down.    Negatives: Most negatives I have are simply bug-based. Sometimes progression on a challenge would not save, often the game gives and errorless crash. Another time, I was glory killing an enemy, and fell through the map and died. These types of problems are killers if you are playing Ultra nightmare. (If you die, you're done. It even leaves your helmet behind with your name and how you died as a warning to players, or just to laugh at someone's misfortune.)   A complaint that I had was that some enemies only had maybe 2 distinct glory kills, while the lesser demons like imps have upwards of 5.  The biggest negative of all was the lack of Co-op campaign. It was beyond frustrating but I understand that the campaign was built for only 1 player. Maybe next time design it as such where co-op is considered from the beginning? (Yes, I know it was stated before release that campaign would not be co-op.)   Multiplayer  Positives: This is where most people are complaining and I have to say I can't disagree with what they are saying. What I can say is that if you get your team in a group and they stick together the whole time, you will decimate any poor enemy player that happens to walk by your horde of marines.  Every gun is good in its own right but ones that stood out to me are the chaingun and lightning gun. Like any game, however, a determined player can master a gun and run with it.  Becoming the demon is very satisfying. You get a rush of 'LOOK AT ME NOW!!! HEY! REMEMBER ME FROM EARLIER!?' as you leap through the air as a prowler and snag some poor guys head to slam into the wall.   The fast paced environment is also quite hectic. Explosions, lightning, plasma, bullets and demons all at once can make for a ridiculously dodgy, fun time.   Negatives: Here is where I see some design that I wish had been done a little differently. Balancing is sometimes off. For example, you wonder why your team is losing 60 kills to 30, then you press tab and see that they have almost twice the amount of players that you do. I wish they did a better job at populating those empty team slots mid-game.  Guns feel overpowered/ underpowered at the same time. Ever wind up the chaingun and start getting hits on a guy, and while he is being hit, he winds his up and kills you first? Yeah, that. Though, in other instances, I go on a 6 kill streak with the thing. (On a side note, 2 players with lightning guns can take down an army at close quarters.)  Getting the demon rune is almost completely random. Maybe it spawns near you, maybe the entire map away. Maybe its always around some corner where an enemy is already grabbing it to kill you. Maybe you get killed as you are about to grab it for the first time in 6 matches. All of this happens on the regular.  Guns need variety. There are a handful of them and you cant even choose the attachments like in the campaign. For example, I only really use 2 loadouts because I can't put a grenade launcher on my combat shotgun so I dont need another shotgun loadout. Get what I mean?  You also unlock them super quickly. In an afternoon you have unlocked basically every weapon and demon. There will be 3 more multiplayer packs containing maps (it needs more), weapons, (it needs more), and demons (definitely needs more). Oh, and more customization for your marine. All in all its negatives don't feel like enough to make me NOT want to play the multiplayer.   Snapmap  Positives: I actually had a really fun time using snapmaps. There is a lot of potential here and I can't wait to see what some creators can make. I have already published 2 maps myself and one of them I am quite proud of. (A co-op survival/ escape map with weapon and equipment shops.) The logic and flow portions are honestly the most fun, too. I could potentially make a king of the hill map for example where there is a demon player, and a timer. If I wanted, I could make it such that killing the demon makes you the demon. If you are the demon at the end, you win.   Executing the logic is quick and easy too. You can test the maps before publishing as well which is nice, and if you happen to notice something you want to change, simply re-upload and it will replace the old version of it, regardless of name change. That is probably my favorite feature so far.   Tutorials are really easy and the puzzles are there to show you a few more examples and give you ideas and are really fun to complete. There is no shortage of reference material either. (There are youtube channels dedicated to snapmap tutorials already, so even if you can't figure it out, the answer is probably out there.)   Negatives: Co-op test play. It doesn't exist. If I want to test a co-op map, I have to publish it (i usually put beta in the title), then host and test with a friend, find a problem, go back to the editor to fix, and re-publish. Note: they side- stepped this problem with the republishing ability, so I doubt it will be changed.  Weapon varieties could be more diverse as well. If I want my team to start with the siege version of the Gauss gun, I should be able to put it in my map. If it's in the campaign it should be in the editor. It's not like a lot of competitive gameplay is going on in snapmap.  Another complaint I had on snapmap is that there werent any rooms from classic doom. You tease us with classic model options for keys, but don't allow classic rooms.  Overall, these shortcomings don't even put a dent in my opinion of the game I love it and feel it earns its spot in the Doom library.",

It polishes and perfects the gameplay formula so well, I'd say this game is the best example of it so far. Other games like Hard Reset and Shadow Warrior from Flying Wild Hog do this as well and they are incredible games on their own right, but the new Doom makes improvements even above the heights those games take it in terms of the quality of gameplay. There are types of enemy patterns and movements I've never seen in an FPS before and they require the kind of second-to-second planning and adaption I've never had to do before. It really makes the genre fresh and new again.  Even though I'm only a few hours into the game so far, I'd tentatively say this is the best FPS game I've ever played. I'll be updating my review once I beat the game to see if it stays that way. There still is the possibility of the formula getting repetitive and old by the end of the game, but it seems very unlikely based on my impression so far.",

It's not that; demons aren't here to scare you, just explode in gore. The story is pretty non-consequential, and I wish they held onto the audio logs idea so I wouldn't have to pause the game and  read . But you're here for the shooting, and the shooting is good.",

I love Snapmap like cray. Made a few simple but very challenging maps. Multiplayer is ok but I dont play it much. Graphics in DOOM are just nothing short of outstanding. 1080p 60fps? thats amazing. I loved the guns. Glory kills NEVER got boring for me. I did them as often as I could. Some people say the glory kills get boring or repetitive after awhile but I strongly disagree. Those were my fav part of the game. I started the campaign back up because I missed sooo many secrets and Classic DOOM maps. So I'm going to take my time and really search around.

Here is a gun - there are some demons - get to it!  The other great thing you will see from the start is that DOOM Guy is not interested in the story and his actions speak louder than words while he punches demons faces off and is generally just one ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off mother ♥♥♥♥er that wants to kill a whole lot of demons.  PROS: - Graphics are great and runs at a solid 60fps on ultra on my GTX 970 - will look at uncapping that. - The level design is amazing and feels very open. I've seen complaints about being locked into an arena but that doesn't happen all that often (unlike games like Painkiller or Zombie Army trilogy for example where it happens all the time) - Upgrades to weapons is a nice touch as it keeps the combat fresh and more dynamic. - In the original DOOM it wasn't as rewarding to find a chainsaw in a secret area when you already had it. In this DOOM there are more things to find so it keeps the spirit of the original but gives you some nice rewards for your efforts. - A heck of a lot of references to the original series including the music, some doors use an updated version of the original DOOM sound, no reloading and   there are some secret areas that look like the original E1M1 map   - Fast paced action, always feel like you are on the move - The glory kills are actually very well done. You can kill your enemies easily with a gun but if you find yourself running low on ammo or health the glory kills will keep you topped up. A regular glory kill will give you mostly health whereas a chainsaw kill will drop a load of ammo (but you can't use the chainsaw too much)  Cons: In regards to the single player portion of the game.. I honestly cant see any cons.  I would mention multiplayer and snap map but I didn't buy DOOM for the multiplayer and snap map is too early to tell if it will be any good. I'd like to see how creative the community will get with this before I comment on that.",

The SP is worth every penny! Pros:  - excellent, optimized graphics - sounds &amp; soundtrack (soo fitting to the battles) - lengthy story/campaign (12hrs on medium) - glory kills (for me, they are a plus and a welcome kinetic element. Further on, they become a life-saver.) - great variety in weaponry, upgrades and bonuses (they make it worth to explore the environment) - replayability guaranteed Inbetween: - SnapMap. Looks interesting, and is explained nicely. Will give it a shot. Cons: - multiplayer. not really the shining star of the show, derivative and rather boring to my liking. But maps are nice, tho.  Overall, a slick package, with a great SP, meh MP and a creative mechanic to it as well. I refuse to downvote this game based on the multiplayer, as it was not the reason why I bought it in the first place. SP-wise, I doubt we will get something in the genre that will surpass it in the near future, the satifaction from gunplay and kinetic energy is really something that is above practically everything else.

There have been very few other times where I have been happier to have been wrong. The single player campaign is everything I wanted it to be. I was afraid that Glory Kills would just be a gimmick and get stale after just an hour or two, but there's actually a bit of strategy to be had with it. Never before have I seen a shooter encourage you so strongly to be insanely aggressive. I just completed it on Hurt Me Plenty, and am immediately going back for more on Ultra Violence.  In short, the campaign is incredibly respectful to old-school Doom, it's nostalgic as hell (pun absolutely intended), and the violence and gore are so intense and unforgiving that I'm looking forward to a school shooting being blamed on it in the future.",

            "review_text": "Where do I start? DOOM is a pretty damn good game, although like any other game it does have its faults, I'll give you the rundown.  First of all let me get the multiplayer out of the way as I feel it is the weakest part of the game. The multiplayer in this Doom just feels like a cashout, all it is is a more gorey version of Halo and there isn't much else about it, it's pretty fun to play but it doesn't feel like it should be in this game. Not to mention the season pass ONLY has multiplayer content in it so I assure you I will NEVER pay for it, I don't know what they were thinking with that because it only splits the player base and I'd never pay money just for extra multiplayer content, the only Doom multiplayer I'll be playing is ZDaemon.   The campaign. Well this is the best part of the game because it incorporates everything we've seen in past Doom games. Great weapons, enemies, gameplay and ofcourse gore. You play as the doom guy ofcourse (or as the demons like to call you 'doomslayer') and you wake up in the UAC laboratories to once again fight like hell against the demons and take back Mars. There's a pretty interesting storyline in this game and I won't go into details but I'd say it's pretty damn good.  Weapons/Enemies. The weapons in this game are very true to the original DOOM however there are some new weapons like the Gauss Cannon and a couple different types of grenades which I never really used. The main weapons which I used most to kill enemies are probably the Super Shotgun, the Rocket Launcher and the Gauss Cannon as they do some great damage and have some good special abilities. The Super Shotgun is probably best for staggering enemies which gives you a good few seconds to fill them with some more bullets. The only problem with the weapons is that you don't really use most of them that often unless it's against a boss. You never use the pistol after you get the shotgun and you never use the shotgun after you get the super shotgun, also the chaingun is one weapon I didn't use a lot as it didn't do much damage at all in my opinion. Aside from that all the weapons are pretty damn cool and almost all have their own abilities that will help you kill more demons. The enemies mostly are the same as the previous games however there are a few new enemies like the shield guy which is pretty hard to kill because as soon as you manage to shoot his shield away he brings it back in like 2 seconds, best to use the gauss cannon against that guy. There is one enemy that doesn't seem to be in the game, the Arch-vile. However there is an enemy called the Summoner which is similar but it darts around spawning enemies and shoots out some red energy rather than yellow fire or whatever the arch-vile shoots out. There are a couple other problems with the monsters such as that the imps are a lot smaller and less threatening than in Doom 3 and the Hell Knight would of been a better fit in my opinion. Also the Pinky enemies are way stronger than in any of the other games which is odd but what's even more surprising is the invisible versions of them are way easier to kill for some reason. Aside from that the enemies look badass and can mess your day up.  Combat/Upgrades. The combat in the game is mostly like any other Doom aside from extra little things like the grenades, the weapons abilities and also the chainsaw runs on gas and you need a certain amount of gas to kill different enemies, the harder the enemy, the more gas you need, it's a great weapon for taking out the one big problem in the area in one big gorey slice. One of the main differences in combat is that you can execute every enemy when they are in a downed state, this is pretty damn fun and although you'll be doing it quite a lot it never gets old. Let's talk about the weapons abilities, You find little robots roaming around each level which can let you unlock a ability for one of your weapons, from there you can play through the game and unlock points to upgrade the abilities. These are very useful as they help alot against the bigger enemies, they do things like freeze the enemies in place, shoot barrages of rockets, extra damaging bullets and many other things. You can also upgrade your armor/suit throughout the game which can do things like negate damage from explosive barrels, help you find secret areas, increase grenade capacity and many others. But no I'm not done, there's more. You can also find another upgrade material which you can use to upgrade your health, armor and ammo capacities. This is probably one of the more mandatory things you can get as you're going to be taking a lot of hits. But wait there is more to come, there are also runes you can find throughout the level and when you interact with them you will be taken to an arena where you can do a trail to unlock a rune which is basically an extra perk that you can also upgrade to be more effective. These runes can make an enemy stay in downed state for longer, make powerups last longer and a bunch of other random stuff I forgot about. Now honestly I feel like there are WAY TOO MANY upgrades/upgradables in this game, it's like they put that in there on purpose so the game would last longer but I don't mind myself cause I like being able to slowly get stronger over the course of the game so the upgrades work pretty well.  To finalize I'll talk about some of the main things like sound, graphics and other random stuff. The graphics are amazing, even though I wasn't playing it maxed out (one day maybe I'll get the gtx 1080) it still looked pretty damn astonashing, the framerate was pretty solid most of the time aside from some slowdowns in some areas, just so you know I'm playing on a GTX 960 and honestly I never had many problems, there was one point where randomly the framerate was terrible for no reason so I had to quit out, I went back in and played for a bit longer then the game randomly closed for no reason, so I just reset my pc and had no further problems. So the graphics are pretty damn good overall and it is well optimized. The sound is great, the stomach churning gore and badass weapons sound wonderful and not to mention the music which is very true to the original Doom games, if you play you'll be sure to hear something familiar. One big problem though that I had with the game was that it felt like one of those dungeon crawler/rogue-like games alot of the time because most of the enemy encounters are after you've completed an objective in an arena-like room, once you've flipped the switch or whatever all the enemies start pouring in and you can't leave the room until they're all dead, I would have much preferred if the enemies were just spread about the maps rather than just spawning in little arenas for you to battle them in.   I've probably missed a few things or left out some information but whatever, here are the positives and negatives for people who don't care to read all my rambling.   Positives: +Awesome weapons and enemies true to the previous games +Good lengthy campaign +Lots of upgrades and collectibles +Lots of backstory and enemy information +Interesting story +Great graphics +Great sound and music +Awesome bosses  Negatives: -Very un-doom-like multiplayer -Season pass only has multiplayer content -A few bugs and glitches here and there -Way too many things to upgrade -Most of the collectibles and upgrade materials show up on the map so they're not hard to find -Some bulletsponge enemies -Not much replay value unless you want to get all the achievements and collectibles -Most enemy encounters are arena-based  Overall it's pretty solid, some problems here and there but every game has problems. I'd give it a solid 8/10 but I'd say you should pick it up on offer, unless you're loaded with cash, then just buy it at full price. If you don't mind paying $60 or whatever for about 10 hours campaign, map editor and multiplayer then pick it up.",

The game feels very DOOM and took me back to when I used to play The Ultimate Doom as a nipper.   It is intense, I recommend wearing headphones with the volume slightly too high. It is smooth, it is fast, it gives you the perfect control that you want to have in an FPS game. You will use that control to brutally destroy one demon after another, using a plethora of different, interesting weapons. Including a chainsaw. And your fists. Which you will use to rip out the heart of a demon and shove it down it's throat. Brutally. Do demons have hearts? You don't care.  There is a story too, sort of. It's not very interesting. But I never cared about that in the first place when I picked up a DOOM game.  I mostly played the game in 1-2 hour spurts, after which I usually felt like taking a break. But then I was always excited to return to the game the next day.

            "review_text": "I've played the campaign twice in this game, once on Ultra Violence and once on Nightmare. It is certainly a challenging FPS shooter, as it differs greatly from generic shooting games.  I found this refreshing, and hard to adjust to at the same time. You never have to reload, which seems less realistic, but thats not what this game is about. Movement is key, and defensive strategies are non existant. The game is like a harsh but practical father that teaches you painful lessons... if you're dying, fight even more to keep living.   I absolutely loved the combat system in this game... pummeling demons with projectiles until they stumble, then rush up and melee them to death. The glory kill system is very well done. The story line is pretty cool, and I thought the mix of action to story was perfect. I enjoy some meaning to why I'm killing everything, and this was just about right.   So overall, the campaign is a masterpiece and I really REALLY hope another side story or campaign is released via DLC. However, the multiplayer is garbage IMHO. As Honest Trailers puts it, it goes together like skittles and fish. It just feels forced, aggravating, and like a mish mash. Snapmap seems pretty cool, I've played some pretty fun maps there.  Even if just for the campgain, I'd still get this game. Overall, quite fun!  UPDATE: So, changed my mind on the multiplayer. It takes some getting used to, but I've since come to actually enjoy deathmatches and especially their new modes, Posession and Bloodrush!",

Just watch the intro, and wait for it to fade to the title. It's telling you what the entire game is going to be like, right there and then.  - The animations. Oh my god the animations.  - There's a great story... if you want to pay attention to it. Because Doom Guy? He only wants to kick demon ♥♥♥. He is only there to RAGE at demons. Constant baddassery.  - The gameplay is smooth and the glory kills are a welcome addition. People think they're absolutely necessary for HP... that's not the case. You could play very far-range and still do fine. Glory kills allow you to get up close and personal.  - Even the first person platforming is fun. Wow. I normally hate that... but they just make it work, here.

            "review_text": "iD has pulled it off and managed to recreate the essential FPS experience.  Fast and beautiful, this game really throws me back to Quake 1 &amp; 2 - which I have played a LOT more than Doom 1 or 2 - while retaining some of that awesome atmosphere and presentation from Doom 3. The throwback is a good thing, mind you: instead of a corridor experience, you get actual maps brimming with secrets, rewarding exploration. Combat is visceral and sounds fantastic, while the equally awesome soundtrack blasts away and encourages you to dive into the fray head first and guns blazing.  The melee kills are a nice addition, as they provide a perfect means of staying in the fight and regain some health. Instead of taking cover, you constantly take the offensive to get an execute. Animations are short, meaning that they never interrupt the flow of the game - even more so if you use a certain rune that speeds up the glory kills significantly. Note that you can disable the somewhat unimmersive glow marker on enemies who can be finished off, which looks better, but can greatly increase difficulty.  Shooting is what you would expect from an iD game, and works very well. Enemies stagger appropriately and guns feel and sound impactful. A simple, yet effective upgrade systems adds up to two secondary fire modes to each gun which can be exchanged mid-battle. These upgrades completely change the way you can use a gun (such as the grenade launcher for your trusty boomstick) and mix the combat up enough to constantly keep it fresh. You also get to upgrade your suit and passive abilities to help you toss more grenades or find more secrets. The upgrade system, while seemingly alien to a doom / quake game, works extremely well. I am not a '100%' gamer most of the time, but here, I felt compelled to unlock all 'ultimate' attachments which is done by completing mission AND weapon addon specific challenges. Lock and load.  And you need those weapon mods, as the game - no surprise - throws progressively harder and more enemies at you. Demons and posessed soldiers behave according to the standard archetypes, closing in for melee or firing from a distance, and usually boast one or two particularly nasty moves that you want to watch out for, quickly teaching you to peel your eyes and ears for the audio and animation queues that lead up to them. I HIGHLY recommend to play on a difficulty that feels challenging to you, because combat is what this game is. Instead of shooting fish in a barrel, you fight your enemies, and you fight them hard. Ultra-Violence recommended for the first playthrough - unless you have too much trouble.  Unless the level design gets far worse from where I am currently, I must say that I am impressed and delighted by this return to form by iD Software. Highly recommended for any FPS fan. EDIT Just beat the final boss. After 25+ hours of battling and upgrading, trying to get everything there is (you can replay missions and get all the goodies) I fought the final boss which goes out with a mind-blowing bang (pun intented) and left me happy except that I wanted more. The visuals of the enemies and locations are fantastic. Animations top notch. Audio is satisfying and crisp. This game's presentation is pretty much perfect. Play it.  Note that all this applies to the single player portion ONLY: the multiplayer, which was not developed by iD software, looks bland &amp; generic and never peaked my interest in the first place. There is plenty on that on the Tube if you are interested. It's not Quake multiplayer, and that is that for me. Odds are I'll never play it. The single player is well worth your time.",

There is also branching level design and semi open environments which allows for exploration to find secrets and upgrades. The enemy variety combat encounters fresh throughout and the game is exteremly well paced and doesn't overstay its welcome. In addition to this the soundtrack is fantastic and very metal which matches the metal visual design of the game. One flaw I found is that the difficulty dropped off towards the end of the game as I obtained more upgrades but all in all doom is a GotY candidate for me and absolutely worth the purchase.",

I admit, at first I was not convinced; poor multiplayer beta and was underwhelmed while watching videos of reviewers playing the beginning of the game. Despite my negative initial impression, I decided to take the plunge and bought the game on release.   I'm glad I did! This feels like a DOOM game - keeping traditional elements such as fast-paced action, monsters, and weapons, while taking advantage of modern developments today. The combat feels fantastic; at first I thought the gore kills were gimmicky, especially when I saw other people play it. In fact, it doesn't just feel great ripping a demon apart, it adds to the gameplay and keeps it unique; most modern FPS want you to take cover and reload. Not DOOM. It encourages you to dive into a demon mosh pit by ripping them apart so you get more ammo and health!   The game also makes good use of weapon upgrades, allowing them to be used in different ways for multiple battle scenarios. Although the format of combat gets repetitive, it always feels fun. Also, upgrades to both weapons and your marine are optional - if you want to play it without them for a greater challenge, go right ahead! The multiplayer is basic and pretty uninspiring (perhaps it will get better in the future), but DOOM is all about the single player experience and modding community!   I admit I am a DOOM fan boy. The original DOOM is one of my favorite games of all time and I have enjoyed all the others (including Doom 3 and Doom 64).

'But what are the downsides?' I hear you ask, well, there are a couple, to start off, the upgrades feel like they don't do ♥♥♥♥, the glory kill animations do get kinda boring after a while, and the game ends coming down to a kil/grindfest towards the end, which on top of that the ending feels like a let-down in terms of story, and from what I've heard the multiplayer is unbalanced, and the snapmaps aren't entirely golden either, and if your computer runs on lemons then good luck running this game. But despite all the negatives I've mention I'd still heavily recommend buying this game at least for the campaign, it's just too good of a game to pass up and not play, I've heard a lot of good things about the original doom, and it seems like they put everything good from the original and made awesomer and shinier, so well done devs, ya did good.",

The formula for this game is: enter new area, kill demons, auto-save checkpoint, repeat.   I'm only playing the single player campaign, and I'm playing on Nightmare on my first serious run. The game is challenging enough on Nightmare, that I find it enjoyable. Each 'fight' in an area is challenging enough that I often need to learn from multiple deaths to develop a strategy for clearing the area. (e.g. Start with gun x and kill 2 specific demons, switch to gun Y and kill the 1 demon that spawns, and jump to that ledge and snipe with gun Z, etc.) The game also has 'rune trials' which are skill-based challenges with a single weapon.   I played the first mission on Ultra-Violence, and I found it too easy. I was able to clear all kinds of fights on my first try, and I saw myself getting bored with it pretty quickly.",

There's a story sort of but it's not intrusive at all and is just there for context. The little story there is, is done well enough. There's also a ton of optional lore related logs to read that give more of an understanding of the world and the situation.  The combat is one of the most satisfying since Wolfenstein The New Order.

DOOM is a very refreshing experience for a large budget FPS in 2016.   When Doom started to interest me was with the Doom 3 released in 2004, however with a mixed reception from the fans Doom 3 was generally a great atmospheric game… but it wasn't Doom, even I could recognise that. The extremely high detailed models and textures for it's time forced the game-play to be designed around more 'scary' moments with smaller fights (presumably to avoid FPS problems). This, fundamentally, was fighting with the spirit of the originals; which had fast movement, lots of guns with variety, lots of monsters on screen, and so on.  ID Software has masterfully taken the Doom IP back to the roots, and reinvented it with respect for the content, understanding of the original games, and a huge amount of passion.  So enter with DOOM (2016). This development team yet again has advanced the state-of-the-art in computer graphics (and also implementing the new 'Vulkan' rendering support API). Quite simply, the game looks and sounds absolutely amazing. Even on the lowest settings the game looks great. Pump up the settings and the game becomes something else. With the Vulkan renderer enabled there is a huge performance boost. On top of this, there are a large number of settings to play with. Wonderful effort has been put into polishing this game.   The campaign is a visceral romp into the UAC space stations on Mars, with teleportation into HELL and back again. The story writing works well, with a demon worshipping scientist unleashing hell onto Mars on the pursuit of some sort of deal with the devil. Your main mission is to close the Hell gate and destroy her (just as she is gifted her demonic form of the Spider Mastermind).   There is some interesting social commentary on 'what will mankind do to make life easier' with a hilarious take on this concept, with the UAC pumping energy directly out of Hell (and Demons too). You will come across background audio-spam from UAC hologram in visitor centres, pleading for you to just accept what they are doing.  The over-all theme is very DOOM. You got your fast movement; You got your wide selection of weapons with different utilities; You got your health and armour, and ammo resource management to consider as well.   But also takes from the Half-life era of gaming, which followed suite from Quake 2. The story plays out with your Doom Guy as a mute protagonist (just like Half Life), and they have some great exploration and platforming mechanics going on here; which is buffered with the double jump boots that you find half way along the journey.  Map design is crafted with a lot of attention to detail, bodies, notes, computer screens all dripping with the theme and horror of Hell opening up. The maps have multiple level segments, sometimes criss crossing around, giving a great range of tones for an FPS title. Other games just stick too horizontally, and become boring fast. In DOOM you are expected to move around (all demons have strong melee hits), and jump/edge grab to different levels of the map. These simple but perfectly utilised mechanics enhance the game-play and add to the visceral nature.   Battles are sometimes from traditional means, and some fights are locked in a room with spawning-in demons. What DOOM does here is 1-to-1 what you see is what you get for monsters. Other modern titles seem to have stuck to an idiotic system of infinite re-spawning soldiers that doesn't stop unless you hit invisible triggers by running forward. This is not what happens in DOOM.   You get a feeling that you are sweeping through the levels, removing the taint as you go along. You are the Doom slayer, after all. This is emphasised throughout the game-play too, from boss monsters and final bosses (that we used to have in games!)  The close combat is granted via glory kills, which you can activate when a demon has staggered from a lot of damage. While time still plays out, and demons can move around while you are camera locks into the glory kill, they don't attack until you are done. These mechanics work extremely well as they reward you with health/armour and sometimes ammo.  The special items return in this instalment of DOOM. Quad damage, invulnerability, haste, and also the new berserk mode which sets you on a spree of glory killing madness.  Weapons are found across the campaign, and so are support drones. These bots carry a weapon mod system that allows you to pick one of two paths for each weapons (usually, since the pistol and super-shotgun have no mods). The mods allow you an alternate firing mode, giving you some more flexibility in combat.  The rune system grants you bonuses (usually associated with killing and using glory kills for more rewards). The Praetor armour can be upgraded by exploring and finding tokens; Argent cells are used to boost your characters health, armour and ammo limits; and then you also get weapons modifications. None of these things were in the original games, all of them are great and work well together in this game. I got a Bioshock vibe from this game, since they allow you a wider variety of how you want to play out the campaign by offering you some choices with respect to your gear.   Overall, the single player run would be about 12 hours just gunning to the end. I played a second time on the hardest difficulty available by default (2 higher ones are presumably unlocked piece-meal). Exploration is almost a necessity, otherwise your character is significantly weaker than if you found all the upgrade mods, praetor tokens and argent cells.  I completed a second run in Ultra Violence finding all items and secrets; completing all combat missions (for extra upgrade points), and finding and upgrading all runes. This was a blast, and probably took about 22 hours to complete by itself. Some gripes: restarting a level removes everything you earned from it (how annoying), otherwise you can load to previous checkpoints and re-do some map content to level up your weapons upgrades or complete challenges). I would have liked a few more characters in the game to flesh out the plot a little more.  Overall, the story is communicated very well and you learn about your character and the DOOM universe. I presume the main arc ended on a cliffhanger, another guy (A creepy scientist in charge of the UAC who happens to have sold out his own soul by becoming a huge robot) who has power over you leaves the scene with some menacing words. DOOM is a great FPS title, a fantastic set of game design mechanics, performance and multi-player to boot (though I haven't tried that yet). It even has custom player maps with the Snap-map system. Even more DOOM for your money.  Recommend to anyone, particularly if you like fast shooters with game-play and story like Half-Life 2 (though it is simpler with very few characters in the game).",

I remember playing the Beta of the original Doom way back in the day when the monsters were stationary but could still attack, I spent probably hundreds of hours with the original and DCK building levels. Doom and Doom2 are similar to this Doom. Doom3 was more of an exploration FPS with tunnels and corridors and hallways - this goes back to the original roots. There are still puzzles, keycards and other item hunting on the side - some classic levels here and there. But mostly it's about going into rooms, triggering a hoard of demons, killing them all, moving onto the boss level fights, killing them all, moving through the base and killing everything, moving through hell and killing everything..... fun fun fun - very frantic at times, yet good for stress relief   Details are great and amazing and if you remember back in the day, the original games, you'll see how far gaming has come over the years. I haven't tried any online or the built-in map maker yet, I did a full play through and went back for more at higher difficulties. Weapons and armor have upgrades to help you stay alive while killing more demons faster but it seems like no matter what upgrade path you choose, in the end you will upgrade everything the same way. A lot of great details in the graphics, even on my Evga 770FTW with 4gb on an i7 920 I can crank the details up pretty far and override the settings to display 2k and it runs smoothly and quick - a few stutters in large fights but that is expected.  I'd give it either 8 out of 10 or 9 out of 10, perhaps both. Hard to say right now since there are so many features I haven't yet messed with, no DLC, no online play, no map maker - so I'm sticking with an 8 for now. Great game for those that have been with Doom for years, probably a good game for those who never played before. Frantic action shooter survival game set on Mars and in Hell. Adds to the mystery and backstory from the earlier games and the movie that Dwayne was in. Sadly, nobody smells what he is cooking these days",

After all, everybody looks the same after being hit by 2 MN worth of impact force. Playing it on Nightmare, weapon and suit upgrades are actually meaningful and encounters engaging, requiring both mobility and situational awareness from the player. Not going fast is usually punished with death. Weapons are satisfying to use, but a bit bland by themselves - the mods, two per weapon, are what actually sets them up for different use cases.

I'll rank the multiplayer as a solid 10/10 solely based on the fact that nobody partakes in it.

It even factors an upgrade system in that doesn't feel forced or arbitrary, instead rewarding different playstyels with unique bonuses.

The idea of a first person shooter focusing on the *shooting* almost seems quaint in 2016. Sure, Doom gives you a few side missions here or there, and the ability to upgrade your weapons a bit. But this is hardly an RPG in disguise. This is a chance to dive in, move fast, and shoot demons in the face.  I thought I had outgrown that.   I was wrong.  Doom is an easy contender for the best game of 2016. It's unapologetically fun. It never takes itself too seriously. The weapons are powerful and cathartic. It provides a stiff challenge without being unfair. And, amazingly for a Bethseda product, it is almost freakishly well optimized, running smooth as silk with the settings cranked up high.

Do yourself a favor and buy this game, and enjoy that sweet awesome hard rock/heavy metal/industrial/DJENT/electronic mishmash of music that was some from the old times, but given just an amazing (this word cannot be stressed enough) music.  Flaws include a weird glitch that cuts sound completely until the game begins, a few crashes during fights, a bit of a loading time thing, checkpoints in some areas that make no sense, and Ultra Nightmare can suck a dead goat's ballsack.

Didn't care much about the story in the begining but game did such a fantastic job of world building that I got very interested in the backstory and I'm gonna share my findings at the end of this review. No game has ever made the player feel like an invincible mighty punisher as good as this one. Game mechanics works fantastic: Stay still and you're dead. Move, shoot and punch and you're rewarded with unparallel satisfaction.   Now this for a Bethesda game is pretty bug free but very rarely expect annoyances like sound direction bug and a monster getting stuck somewhere that you have to find and kill. Also the amount of space this game takes is insane. Put aside 100GB at least.   If you've already finished the game and have questions about the story read on for my take.    The Doom Marine/Doom Slayer was the leader of Night Sentinals, a brotherhood of strongest warriors protecting the wraith beings from the outside world and vise versa. His son was killed in the invasion of hell so he betrays the night sentinals to have his son resurrected from hell. After a hell priest corrupts the wraiths and all the other Night Sentinals are killed, the hell lords betray their bargain with the Doom Marine and bring his son back in demon form as the Icon of Sin. That is when Doom Marine goes on his killing spree and swears to kill every single demon and end the dominion of hell. After a while killing demons and winning every fight the heavens reward doom with more power and speed as well. Why does he wear a different armor than his Night Sentinal brothers? In his conquest of hell he finds 'The one who shall not be named' who forges him an invulnerable armor (the doom armor) and unstoppable weapon (the crucible) from pure hell energy. But he also hides some secrets in the weapon without doom marine's knowledge to bring his downfall (I guess we will see what that is in future games).  ",

You shoot demons with guns, unoccluded by meaningless open-world shenanigans or whatever sorry excuse for a story ('Show, don't tell' is dead as ♥♥♥♥) the certified multi-ethnical and multi-religious writing division came up with in between posting hateful messages on Twitter - unlike other contemporary titles, this one is pleasantly free of political agendas. After all, everybody looks the same after being hit by 2 MN worth of impact force. Playing it on Nightmare, weapon and suit upgrades are actually meaningful and encounters engaging, requiring both mobility and situational awareness from the player. Not going fast is usually punished with death. Weapons are satisfying to use, but a bit bland by themselves - the mods, two per weapon, are what actually sets them up for different use cases. Still miles ahead of every other 'realistic' weapon lineup in other titles. If I want to get shot at by boring-♥♥♥ gas-propelled ballistic weaponry, I'd go to the nearest mall. I'll rank the multiplayer as a solid 10/10 solely based on the fact that nobody partakes in it. That's a fantastic concept and I hope it gets picked up by the industry to go along with the mandatory multiplayer component that's part of every modern AAA title. After all, why the hell would you want to associate yourself with any of the other mental defects in here, are you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥? Do you actually have brain damage? Summing up, it's alright. As per usual, apply Threepwood's proposition (corollary: 20$ in 1990 equal 36.27$ nowadays) and you should be fine. Also passes the litmus test of wall recognition, for what it's worth.",

But with this amount of destruction, hell, and by the more amazing soundtrack, I just have no words on how this game changed me.   The music in this game makes me feel like I want to slaughter donald trump so badly...man, feels like I was sent straight to hell after playing this game. Plus, this ispired me to change my previous profile pic into a bloody mess &gt;:) Edit: Now to doomguy, lol  The gameplay is great. You still move fast asf and its nothing tactical. This brings back the classic arcade but with beautiful detail and great content. In my opinion, arcadish games like is like the cure to all this gaming catastroy. Praise ID Software and Bethesda for this...  The campaign is jus the best out of the three modes. Even though there isn't much of a story, ITS JUST SO GOOD TO SLAUGHTER DEMONS AND FIGHT LIKE HELL. You can find many collectibles, upgrades, and the nostalgic classic maps. Feels like they really want to make DOOM like it always was in the past. The campaign will last you 11-16 hours depending on difficulty.  Multiplayer is the second mode you can try. It is sort of lacking/dying and sometimes it feels unfair when people use the rocket launcher. But thats the point really, games today restrict you from doing the damage and going on a rampage. And in my opinion, guns really don't matter. What really matters is how well you're good with them. Hell, even I aint great with the launchers. So everyone likes to use different guns sometimes. But I really like how its not just some gun action but also demon action and just complete carnage.   Snapmap is the third mode where you can create you own unique kind of maps and make it how you want it. Can be a TDM, Surivival, or come up with a new type of mode. (Btw, you can make a MOBA in the editor too, so LOL and DOTA fans should try making more of these modes.) Even if you get snapmap points from playing, you wont really need them much because the point of playing in other snapmap creations is to have fun.   One more important detail about this game is that this is one of the only game that doesn't make you want to grind or try to waste your time to get stronger. No, you have the power to rip and tear through demons and it already makes the game fun asf! Same goes with rocket league. Even if you started from scratch, you will already feel like a complete badass and will have a great time.   Now a few things I should also let you know about the slightly bad side of the game: Multiplayer and Snapmap could get repetitive, so grab some friends to keep the fun going. Playing solo would likely want you to just keep playing the campaign. But other than that, the game is pure fun and definately lets you keep playing.  If you want a game that makes you want to make you blood pump and make you feel excited asf, GET THIS GAME NOW. It is 666% guarenteed the worth of 60 bucks and you will love the living ♥♥♥♥ out of it.  P.S. I wish I can recommened this game more than once because I just want more people to buy it so we can revive the multiplayer. It's dying plz help :(",

It does not hold your hand, and it some parts it will even beat you mercilessly over the head. It will not seem too difficult at first; maybe even for the first few hours if you're a good gamer. However, trust me it gets difficult, almost comically difficult... But NEVER boring or overly frustrating. Only at a few small instances did I ALMOST get bored - more like frustrated - at a couple of minor 'puzzle' areas in which the exit or next step is not clear, but those were pretty rare breaks from the intense action. The weapons are fantastic and the mechanics are smooth. And the music... The music is ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic. 10/10 soundtrack.  My only complaint is that I wish you could always control the direction of your jumps/double jumps without having to unlock that ability later in the game.

            "review_text": "id did an outstanding job in this modern approach to the classic fast-paced, arcade-style first-person shooter.  DOOM is balanced differently than most other FPSes. The overarching principal of gameplay is 'push forward' combat: demons move fast and can quickly inflict lots of damage, there is no regenerating health or cover system, and your ammo limits are lower and can be quickly exhausted. To offset this, enemies drop significant amounts of health and ammo, often in types you're low in. The result is that you need to actively fight to survive—while there are situations where you can snipe a few demons to reduce their numbers before moving in, you need to stay in motion or you'll get mauled quickly. The ammo limits and fast-paced combat also means you need to be able to make tactical decisions like choosing weapons quickly—you cannot just rely on one weapon for most fights. The end result is a dynamic and intense shooter experience that tests both your reflexes and your wit.  Levels are remarkably detailed and the game plays well even on older (albeit high-end) hardware. On my laptop (Core i7-4800MQ, overclocked GeForce GTX 780M), the game plays smoothly on (auto-detected) medium settings at 1080p, maintaining a stable 40-60fps. Vulkan support helps a bit as well, though not as markedly as it does on AMD GPUs (detailed performance metrics indicate the game is GPU-bound on my machine regardless of whether OpenGL or Vulkan is selected).   One caveat for those picky about DRM: This game uses Denuvo Anti-Tamper. While this is not an issue for most players as it is vastly less intrusive than the old StarForce or SecuROM DRM systems (it certainly isn't an issue for me), it does need reactivation on hardware changes and imposes an activation limit of 5 per 24 hours, which may impact players who switch computers or change hardware very frequently.   Edit:  Denuvo protection was removed in Update 5.  This game is a must-buy for anyone who's a fan of fast-paced shooters.  Recommended. ",

Level design is really good and the model details are amazing. Animations are fluid, cutscenes are short. In fact that are barely any cutscenes.  The level of settings there are is really good, and you don't even have to change everything if you don't want to with the presets for graphical/advanced settings. The game runs really well.   Gameplay is great. It feels like the original DOOM. Sometimes I've run on into a room and fought everything and other times I hid behind corners and ran away. That was the original DOOM. The amount of secrets and the difficulty of finding most of them is great. I find myself going back and fourth searching for some things, and if you don't want to do that you can always just go on your way. The feature of going back to the original levels is nostalgic while also feeling new. I love just how different the levels are. One of the things missing from the original was an almost puzzle like feature, but I feel that's fine.   If you want this game for anything other than hunting for secrets, hiding from enemies, and fast-paced fighting, then you're out of luck. This doesn't have crazy mechanics or advanced puzzle solving, it's just 'go in there and kill everybody.' One mechanic it does have however is 'glory kills.' Glory kills are a way to make you get upclose and use melee. I think they really improve the fun factor of the gameplay without ruining the fast-paced fighting. They're short animations.   -MULTIPLAYER SECTION-  While singleplayer is amazing, multiplayer feels at least 'OK.' Personally if I had to vote on a DOOM that was only the multiplayer it would be hard deciding whether or not to recommend it. It feels kind of boring because nothing goes on half the time. Not even music plays during the game, (which is fine, but added with how you aren't even fighting a lot of the time, it makes it a bit more boring.) The multiplayer fighting is pretty fun. There are level systems as most multiplayer games go and there are power ups like turning into a demon. The demon part is fun because it switches up how you play. As soon as you get to become a demon you have to use different weapons and everything, which can make the game fun. To be honest I never played much of the multiplayer, so this review is technically only for Team Deathmatch. I MIGHT edit this later if I play any of the other multiplayer stuff.  Lots of customization for your character. You can do the weapons, which have individual parts to put colors and patterns on, you can do your character which has tons of different models, and you can change your loadouts/modules.  It does have fun parts and boring slow parts sometimes, but the one thing I absolutely hate is the amount of multiplayer DLC. There's a lot of this stuff that they're still releasing. They even have achievements for this stuff. I'm actually glad they're not releasing singleplayer DLC though. I dont want to spend 50 dollars for them to add a couple things. I'd rather wait for another game, even if it means years.  -SNAPMAP SECTION-  Snapmap feels very nice. You can do so much with it. Creating levels is easy to do and there's so much you can create. There is soooo much decoration to this thing it's like DOOM's version of Planet Coaster's building. Beside any of the decoration there is also triggerable things such as audio files. There is a lot of stuff for that. I mean someone built a piano out of all the stuff. It's always fun looking at what people have uploaded. I have not played snapmap in a couple months but from what I remember there was a limit to things. Enemy limits. Building size limit (while this itself is okay, the game limits this a lot.) But overall snapmap is good.  -CONCLUSION/ETC.-  Soundtrack is amazing. I turned down the voices and effects to hear the music more. I listen to this with Apple Music all the time. It's industrial metal through most of the music and it switches to almost fully electronic music near the end (of both the soundtrack and the game.) It fits the theme of how brutal Hell is and all the sort of energy in Hell and electronics of Mars.   In conclusion this review was probably way too long. so LISTEN HERE IF ITS TOO LONG. Overall this game is amazing. Everything fits the feeling of Hell and Mars and the gameplay feels like I could never stop playing it over and over. While multiplayer is kind of boring and that sucks, singleplayer and snapmap are both very good and both have a lot to offer. Overall this game feels amazing and is easily one of my favorites.  ***If you have any suggestions for how I could improve this review, please post in the comments. I'm not going to try to shorten this review though.***",

It was revolutionary and I have so much good memories with that game that it's really hard to surpass it. In fact the Doom (2016) can't surpass it. Can't because it's a totally different game. It's good, visually nice, but today's FPS games can't really give back that old Doom feeling. If we compare it to the old game, it's a completely different gameplay. Enemies are far fewer but more skilled of course.  In my opninion the developers did not even want a pure FPS game (in the the classes original meaning), they wanted some kind of survival horror feeling. Unfortunately for me it failed to give me the horror. You get too soon, too many weapons and never seem to run out of ammo. This means you always feel completely safe. That's not really good for a survival horror wanna be game.  On the other hand the shooting/combat part is fun. So if you take the game as pure FPS it's good. You miss the scary horror but in exchange you blast your way to the end with massive weapons, chainsaw enemies in half and rip apart demons with your bare hands in berserk mode in very-very gorey ways. Unfortunately there are not enough enemies. I would add much more swarms to this game.  Do I recommend it? As a horror game no. As an FPS yes :)",

            "review_text": "HUGE id Software and classic DOOM fan. Was skeptical of this game initially but it's turned out to be very metal and fun. The gameplay model isn't my favorite à la Painkiller where you're fenced in till the last enemy is slain but it's tolerable. Glory kills are a big aspect of gameplay that do an interesting job of giving you a second to orient yourself as you slaughter wave after wave of demons. The best glory kills belong to the chainsaw which are hilariously brutal. It gets even better with berserk mode which is ridiculously violent where you don't merely pummel demons to death but rip them apart with your bare hands. You don't get any more metal than that. I think my favorite feature has to be arcade mode and centering the gun to make it like classic DOOM. Playing it like this in arcade mode brings this game very close in feel to the original DOOM which is an extremely impressive feat.  Now as far as the game's aesthetics go, the id tech 6 engine is superb. id Software continues to remain competitive, if not the leaders, in 3D game engines despite John Carmack's departure. Even on low settings everything looks stellar. I think a lot of this is owed to exciting, varied map design.   What I'm not a fan of--and this is subjective and totally irrelevant if you're artistically ignorant (I'm an opinionated b*****)--is the look of the demons. I don't know who the f*** the art lead was on this project but they did an awful job and took this in more of a complex alien than simple demon direction which I HATE with a passion. None of these demons look fierce or beastial. They look like they were designed by hack comic book artists with all this unnecessary detail and these stylized pointed shapes to them that make them look more comical than *believable*. Cyberdemon and spider mastermind look absolutely stupid. I would have liked to have seen more serious, classic-looking demons without such an obnoxious art direction. Wish Adrian Carmack had been lead. At least they stayed close to the DOOM 3 design for the hell knight which looks tough.   The soundtrack by Mick Gordon (of Wolfenstein: The New Order and Killer Instinct) is the best game soundtrack I've heard since the original Metal Gear Solid. It's LOUD, metal and has a noisy, industrial sound reminiscent of previous id collaborator Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails. When the demons start swarming in and you've got this music on your side, it gives you added strength. Incredible soundtrack.  On the subject of audio, I do however wish to opine that some of the guns sound a little underwhelming like the shotgun and assault rifle. This is very disappointing particularly because you hear the sounds so much. The gauss cannon probably sounds the most powerful and devastating of all the weapons.   As for the story itself, it's quite dull, unfortunately. I could barely pay attention in most scenes with dialogue and I don't even understand or recall the origin they give to our character or why you wake up chained to a table. Nothing shocking or exciting or memorable even, but this can be forgiven as this is DOOM/id Software and story has never been the studio's strong point. (Recall John Carmack's quote: 'Story in a game is like a story in a porn movie. It's expected to be there, but it's not that important.') Honestly, I've never even played a game for the story but I really do appreciate good writing. Alas, none to be found here.   Finally, what I MUST give praise for is the decision to NOT give DOOM guy a voice or lines. After Dead Space 2 and Fallout 4 where our characters were imposed with a voice (thereby ruining both games for me) rather than it left to our imaginations, I was worried DOOM may have been the next victim. Fortunately, id stayed true to the franchise and didn't fall victim to this. THANK YOU!   To sum up, DOOM (2016) isn't artistically perfect like classic DOOM but it does succeed in having rather fun gameplay and replayability: an absolute must which is what keeps me firing up classic DOOM year after year.",

It's hitting all my buttons in the right spots (no creepy). It's keeping me on edge like the original did. And it's looking like a polished diamond while doing so. I was getting annoyed by the melle death kills, but I'm noticing that they want you to do that to get more ammo/health. So after a bit I was using that as my strategy. What do I need now? Ammo? Ok, pull out the chainsaw and rip meat. Need health? No problem, just bash a head in. Or two. I like that they included that into the strategy instead of hoarding ammo or health. No spoilers, like I said, I just played for 2 hours. And I'm looking for more. I've already seen plenty of Youtubers play this and I must say, my first hand experience is that I like it. I love it. I wanta more of it! Although another fault I've seen is that the first few levels are pretty much on rails so far, although it's expanding up pretty good so far. Which brings me to the map. ... ...

I am not by any means a die hard DOOM fan, lets get that out there. I have played all other DOOM's to their maximum capbability and then some thanks to the modders of the DOOM universe. The first thing one must realize is that......this is DOOM. The name literally explains the game. Marine sees demons, marine picks weapon of choice, demons die. DOOM 3 in my own opinion was the black sheep of the series, this was a timewarp back to the old days.   Level design---&gt;Honestly each level had its own unique design. It was not at all linear or predicatble. There are usually many ways to achieve that ONE path which leads you to the next area. Obstacles and jumping, climbing, and various thinking designs are used to get from place to place.  Environment---&gt; It is quite.....DOOMY. LOL. Seriously though the environment is perfect. The areas get more and more dreadful as the game progresses. Amazing detail, textures, particles and very very few if any collision bugs ( none for me, there have been mixed opinions)  Gore---&gt; Its DOOM......enough said  Enemy AI---&gt; WAS FREAKIN AMAZING!!!!! I am sad to say that the Imps kicked my tail during the first level! They have multiple combat tactics from the Imp all the way to the Cyber Demon. Beginners to DOOM will be on their toes alot, where I and others who are used to DOOM and high super fast paced killing will usually be able to detect their next move  Story/Collectibles---&gt; The collectibles are pretty hard to find. Especially the dolls, the proto chips for the suits are difficult as well, allowing for a rather impressive exploration concept. The story IS NOT given to you. The collection of Data pads, runes and more are needed should you wish to uncover the full story here.  Overall? ---&gt; Will play on Nightmare and die alot.

The first thing one must realize is that......this is DOOM. The name literally explains the game. Marine sees demons, marine picks weapon of choice, demons die. DOOM 3 in my own opinion was the black sheep of the series, this was a timewarp back to the old days.   Level design---&gt;Honestly each level had its own unique design. It was not at all linear or predicatble. There are usually many ways to achieve that ONE path which leads you to the next area. Obstacles and jumping, climbing, and various thinking designs are used to get from place to place.  Environment---&gt; It is quite.....DOOMY. LOL. Seriously though the environment is perfect. The areas get more and more dreadful as the game progresses. Amazing detail, textures, particles and very very few if any collision bugs ( none for me, there have been mixed opinions)  Gore---&gt; Its DOOM......enough said  Enemy AI---&gt; WAS FREAKIN AMAZING!!!!! I am sad to say that the Imps kicked my tail during the first level! They have multiple combat tactics from the Imp all the way to the Cyber Demon. Beginners to DOOM will be on their toes alot, where I and others who are used to DOOM and high super fast paced killing will usually be able to detect their next move  Story/Collectibles---&gt; The collectibles are pretty hard to find. Especially the dolls, the proto chips for the suits are difficult as well, allowing for a rather impressive exploration concept. The story IS NOT given to you. The collection of Data pads, runes and more are needed should you wish to uncover the full story here.  Overall? ---&gt; Will play on Nightmare and die alot.   Since the above are pros, lets get to the cons i experienced..... 1. DOOM does not like recording software. I didnt get it to work 2. Had 3 random crashes ( I did have recording software online......may be linked...) 3. MASSIVE....MASSIVE download time.  I recommend this game with all of my non existent heart",

Every weapon has a purpose and you can definitely play through the game without leaning on the BFG, which is awesome. The weapon mods were a nice touch, but I found myself rarely if ever switching between the two options on any of them except the Shotgun and the Gauss Rifle.  Overall if you enjoy fast-paced gunplay that flows seamlessly and runs great, DOOM is worth every penny for the Single Player alone. The multiplayer has never been what this franchise is about, so if you're looking for an online experience, you'll find better options elsewhere.",

I have played DOOM since 1993 and still play and make maps to this day for the originals. So my review is based on how it it as a reboot to the series, and how it pits itself against modern FPS games. 10/10 for the Single Player.  The weapon system is awesome, choosing what upgrades to use, when you want to use them, switching between each weapon flawlessly and quick feels so fluid.  The monsters are designed beautifuly, including the bosses who are heaps better than what DOOM 3 had to offer, anytime I would see the \\'Arch Vile\\' (Summoner) I would actually go into panic mode as it was the only monster that I had issues with.   The enviroments are absolutely beautiful and detailed as hell.   The music is badass and fantastic, the OST needs to be released, I would happily pay money for it.  The action is actually extremely fast paced in SP and a blast. There wasn\\'t a dull moment in DOOM that I could find.   The optimization for this game too is amazing, only running a 950m and i7-4720HQ and can play this game flawlessly. 30 ish FPS on medium, and 45ish FPS on low. (Yes I know time for an upgrade but building a PC when the 1080 comes out.)  I loved this game so much I bought it twice, once for PC and once for PS4.  Multiplayer 7/10  Don\\'t get me wrong, I love the multiplayer, i\\'ve had a blast with it. But I personally didn\\'t think it lets itself up to be what it could have been. Loadouts, and game speed are the killer for me. Other than that, the multiplayer is great, tons of stuff to unlock, badass armour to equip, and running a match where you absolutely dominate just feels so great. The demon runes too are a blast to play as, as well. But all in all, besides Demon Runes, the multiplayer doesn\\'t offer too much new ideas. Still fun though. (Biasm due to obsession with DOOM as a whole may be included in this multiplayer review.)  SnapMaps 5/10 hopefully 9/10 in the coming months, and 7/10 if you don\\'t know how to or never will mod.  As of right now, Snapmaps is a boring, useless tool, and I don\\'t see many great things come of it... yet...  12 monster limit, bugs in the logic (weird bugs.), limited things about the way you can build maps, and the presets are boring as hell. Spent 2 full days making a map, and probably won\\'t ever make a map again. If I only got the game on PS4, I probably would rate it higher as it is a wonderful map editor for console. But for PC, it is ♥♥♥♥. Doom needs true modding support, and there should be way less limitations on snapmap for PC. Plus no boss monsters on snapmap? Disappointing. Although ID/Bethesda plan to release a lot more content for snapmap, I don\\'t see it ever becoming a replacement for modding support. However for people who can\\'t or never will pick up modding it will be great for you. Also the menu\\'s for navigating snapmap maps is a mess right now, with the same content appearing on the front page all the time.  There is work that needs to be done for snapmaps at the moment. A lot of work.  My 4th and final critisicm of the game is no modding support as said above. Hopefully someone can find a way to make modding possible, but as of right now I don\\'t see that happening for a long time.  As for DLC, if all they plan to release is multiplayer related DLC and snapmap related DLC, I think they are going in the wrong direction. The fans (from what i\\'ve seen and including myself) want Singleplayer DLC.   Other than that here\\'s a recap.  Singleplayer: 10/10 Multiplayer: 7/10 Snapmaps 5/10, 7/10, 9/10?  The Singleplayer experience alone trumps the MP and snapmaps enough that I highly, highly recommend it to anyone who likes FPS games/ DOOM games/ or action games.  PS. If you love Devil May Cry, or DMC, you will find this game right at home for you.",

This is the classic Doom experience dropped into the excellent id Tech 6 engine while still preserving the rules/gameplay that defined the original. Modern updates to the formula, such as weapon/suit upgrades, serve only to enhance the core experience rather than re-defining it. Anyone for whom Doom was a formulative gaming experience will quickly fall back into the rhythm here, while those who cut their teeth on Halo/COD might feel like fish out of water temporarily but will fall in quickly with a bit more investment.   Gameplay is fast and furious with the original Doom 'glide' in full effect. No reloads, no cover shooting, this is a game that rewards aggression and constant forward momentum. That would be a problem if the engine/mechanics didn't support it, but the movement and shooting are as tight as any arena shooter in recent memory. The new execution mechanics fit perfectly into the aggressive/fast gameplay style, and along with the chainsaw (which generates ammo) incentivize a pace that comes as a breath of fresh air after a decade of duck-and-reload shooters.   Bottom line, if you have any fondness for the early PC FPS era or you want to try out a new experience that feels significantly different from other modern shooters, you can pick up Doom without concern that it throws the baby out with the bathwater. This is a labor of 90s-era FPS love, and you can feel it every time you shotgun an imp and then explode its head with your bare hands.",

In this review, we will be looking at the Pros, Mixed, and Cons of DOOM (2016)  Pros: + Extremely fun and satisfying gameplay. As everybody knows, DOOM is a FPS, but DOOM (2016) is not Doom 3. The gameplay is extremely fast paced like original DOOM games, like The Ultimate Doom and Doom 2. As much as I liked Doom 3, I found it extremely slow and at some points boring. DOOM solves this greatly by making it extremely fast paced, which is something I think fans of the original game were looking for.  + The graphics are extremely good, especially when set to higher settings. This game graphics much better than Bethesda's Fallout 4, which were showing the age of Skyrim's engine. Also, it runs a lot smoother than Fallout 4, which only adds to the gameplay of DOOM, allowing it to be fast paced.  + An extremely long  story  campaign. The game will take you around 12-13 hours to beat, or at least for me it did.   + Tons of replay value. In Wolfenstein: The Old Blood, I noted how I thought the game was fun, but there was this section that took me more than 2 hours to beat, because it had force stealth (When stealth is forced upon to beat a section or at least make it barely impossible) in it, which ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off greatly. However, very few sections in DOOM are frustrating. If I died, I felt that it was usually my fault and it was not extremely difficult to the point of making it a chore to play, except for the Final Boss, but what do you expect. I would honestly replay this game, especially since how fun it was.  Mixed: - SnapMap and Multiplayer are not that good. I would have put this at cons, BUT I am thankful that they at least tried it. Wolfenstein: The New Order nor Wolfenstein: The Old Blood had multiplayer, which makes me happy that they at least tried it. I haven't really tried Snapmap, but from looking at it, it is something that could have potential in the future.  - No modding tools except for Snapmap. This could be considered a killer for some people, but I need people to remember if the core game itself isn't good, but mods make it better, than the game is not good.  Cons: - Crashes. Throughout my entire experience, I had around 5-6 desktop crashes and one full computer crash, which was annoying. Luckily, I did not have to restart a major part or lose any of my data, but I would imagine it being hell if anybody had to restart the entire campaign because of a crash corrupting their saves.  - Glitches. At first, I was surprised at how I experienced NO glitches. UNTIL mission 12, where I experienced a major glitch, forcing me to restart at the checkpoint. Basically, an enemy was invisible and impossible to hit. I looked around for maybe 20 minutes, trying to find this enemy, but could never do so. I gave up and was forced to restart from a checkpoint.   FINAL VERDICT  9.5/10  That is my review of DOOM (2016). I recommend buying this game right now, by right now, I don't mean a minute, I mean RIGHT DAMN NOW. This game is extremely fun and it is worth every penny. I hope they make a sequel and I am damn excited for the DLC.",

The game is very much focused on the gameplay over mechanics such as QTEs and cutscenes. Like Dark Soul 3 or Alien Isolation, I recommend you play on harder difficulties to get the most out of the experience. If it's too easy, you'll get bored.  Multiplayer  Multiplayer is solid as long as you don't go into it with expectations that it was supposed to be Quake. Warpath and Clan Arena stand out as solid competitive modes. There are some imblanaced weapons at the moment, but that can be easily corrected. Customization is solid and there's no pay-to-win features. If the game had competitive matchmaking in the same vein as CS:GO, it would be golden.  SnapMap   SnapMap has a lot of potential and reminds me of the Starcraft 2 level editor and Arcade mode. I'm looking forward to what people create with it. I played through several of the pre-populated maps at launch with some friends and we had fun. If they provide additional toolsets for this, we could see some really great maps.  This game is worth the money. If you're even remotely on the fence, I recommend getting it.",

            "review_text": "When it came to gameplay, I absolutely loved the short time I spent playing Doom. The gfx were wonderful, the gameplay happened at a rapid pace, and I was starting to get involved in the SP story line. Unfortunately, I happened to be a victim of the developer mode bug. In a nutshell, out of blue I received a notification that I was put into developer mode, and as a result certain features of the game were disabled. According to the dev message, the solution is to delete my SP Game save and start from scratch. Unfortunately, this did not work. Even deleting the files and folders in C:\\Users\\me\\Saved Games\\id Software\\ did not solve the problem (there are a few more steps that I followed to try and resolve this problem, but I digress). When I first open the game after deleting the files I can play just fine. However, as soon as I quit Doom and then re-launch, I get the 'you are in Dev mode' error.  Fortunately, I had played the game for less than 2 hours so I just ended up requesting and receiving a refund from Steam.  If it wasn't for this absolutely horrible bug, I would definitely recommend this game. In the end, I simply cannot recommend purchasing at this time until Bethesda releases a fix (as of 06-02 this bug has been met with silence).  Honestly, I have no idea how many people its affecting; for all I know it could be less than 1%. That being said, there is currently a 500+ post thread on Steam regarding this issue. Ironically, the thread was started by a Bethesda Developer. Long story short, if the Dev Mode bug gets resolved, I will definitely purchase the game again. Otherwise, I am happy with my refund!  Just FYI, I strongly recommend any new purchasers test out their Doom install as soon as possible to determine whether or not you are affected by this bug (If you play the game for more than 2 hours, Steam will not give you a refund). Based on my experience, the best way to determine if you are affected is to simply exit out of the game and then re-launch it. If you receive a message about network services being disabled and dev mode being enabled, you are most likely affected by this bug. Honestly, you should perform the exit/relaunch process as many times as possible. Some people don't run into this issue until they are hours into the game. IMO there is simply nothing you can do to fix it at this time.  Hopefully Bethesda will at least post an update as to whether or not they are planning on fixing this.",

I liked the fast paced nature, the old-school level design, finding health packs etc. So I took a chance on DOOM, and I'm glad I did.  Not quite finished yet, I reckon I'm about half way (at a little over 9 hours) and DOOM is glorious. I haven't had this much fun with a shooter since Half-Life.   It's single player is as good as everyone says. The story is minimal, but you don't care about that do you? Even Doomguy, your player character doesn't care. He crushes, smashes and chainsaws his way through everything. He doesn't speak but his actions speak for him. All he wants to do is kill demons and you will kill thousands of them.  The game runs great on my computer, and looks amazing as well. The combat is fast and challenging, and the levels are massive with multi-tiered maps, secrets, key hunting complete with power ups and pickups. They even threw in weapon upgrades, suit upgrades and challenges. If you look hard enough I'm sure you will find all sorts of Easter Eggs as well.   DOOM is a great game for single player but it also has a Multiplayer mode and a Map creator I haven't even touched yet. It's a full package and worthy of a spot on your Steam library.   ",

In the multiplayer, it is generally a cluster♥♥♥♥ of rockets flying around, fps dropping, a giant demon frying your brains out and oneshotting everyone and that one annoying sniper that somehow always know where you are. But it's fun. Featured gamemodes include: King of the hill (or dominion), Kill Confirmed, Team Deathmatch and Protect the Payload. All of that is supported by the heaviest of metals and coated in a beautifully designed character customization.  Overall a very solid game that has high entertainment value and can easily keep you captivated for quite some time.  Would I recommend purchasing this game? Well, let me rephrase that question for you: Can you kick the Devil's ♥♥♥ with just a shotgun? Hell yes!",

I don't care if I come across as a white knight or whatever but the negative reviews are pretty inaccurate, the forum trolls most of them don't even own the game to comment on and if people would read the pin about the drivers that solves most of the problems.  Pros: Doom, seriously need I say more? I mean seriously the first thing you do in the game is get attacked by some mobs and you club them to death with their own body parts, what is not to like? I've actually spent most of the game just doing melee kills for fun. I get to kill a large quantity of things Ultra violence mode or go home, don't even think of 'I'll just try something less than ultra violence to see if I don't suck first' There is a beyond nightmare mode, do want!

I'm not normally one for a game with 0 character development, minimal voice acting, no customisation (to do with the character/s ) and a complete lack of realism. But none of that is needed here, it's just you, your shotgun (and what a shotgun, I was still clearing entire rooms with the standard shotgun on the last level) and an army of demons and thats the way it should be.   In a lot of ways this game is the living embodiement of 'if it aint broke dont fix it'. Sure, there's some changes, but these are nothing more than improvements. I was skeptical of this 'Glory kill' mechanic as a lot of times repeated kill animations can get very boring, but in DOOM they never stop being awesome, whether it be because you get healed by performing them or because you just cleared an entire room with your fists, it never gets old (at least for me it didn't, I cant speak for everyone). Then we have the chainsaw, which (depending on how much fuel you have for it) is an instant kill ammo refilling device. Just keep killing and watch your health\\ammo refill in an instant.  I keep finding myself thinking 'Imagine if Duke Nukem Forever was as good a reboot\\sequel as this'  I thought DOOM (the originals) were pretty good before I played this, now I ♥♥♥♥ing love DOOM.",

This game is what happens when a legendary developer does not become a crippled abomination over time. Growing fantastically into the new age of next generation gaming, id brings yet another one-ton diamond to the table with one of the most replayable, entertaining, satisfying shooters of all time.   The weapons are punchy, the executions are fast and brutal, and few games will give you the sense of classic joy that this game brings. Run and gun, blast demons back to Hell, all to the tune of sick metal riffs. If we were worried that this Doom would follow the path of Doom 3, we can set those worries aside.  Multiplayer is wicked fast and great fun, requiring speed, prediction, and coordination.   The Snap Map is brilliant, and I can't wait for updates or DLC to add new parts and pieces to play with.  That said, sometimes the formula gets a little bit stale in both visuals and set pieces. In general, you walk around, look for secrets, stumble upon this hellish portal looking thing, rip a flesh blob off to shut it down, and then fight the inevitable demon wave. This is basically on repeat. Despite the beautiful visual effects, there's so much red and orange that you'll actually notice when things are different colors. This can lead to occasionally stale environments, which don't combo well with the aforementioned 'shut down portal, fight monsters, repeat.'  Regardless, you'll be hard pressed to notice its few missteps when you're curb stomping a demon with his own leg (that is an actual thing you can do), or desintegrating the upper half of a huge demon with a two-handed gauss cannon.  Buy it. You won't regret it.",

I only completed this game on normal difficulty and I will most likely go back and play it on hard and maybe do a few speed runs because its set out for speed runs as the devs told us.The campain was a bit bland and repetitive with mission pretty much consisting of shut down something or turn on something and kill everything.

The games pacing is good and some of the battles get get INTENSE.....youll know by the end of the game!

I would say 'Sure honey, but I love the thoughts of slippin' around in monster guts a little more.' I spent 10 years working at a slaughterhouse on the kill floor slippin' around in cow guts on a counta it was the closest I could come to slippin' around in monster guts. And then.....and then in May of 2016, Bethesda released DOOM and my lifelong dream came true! I quit my job, divorced my wife and pretty much just blow monsters away 24/7 with very cool guns and then slip around in their guts. I was DOOMed from the start! Thanks Bethesda! You complete me.",

On top of that you get an extremely smart and satisfying upgrade progression for your suit and weapons that offer new, interesting ways to use them and create a bit of choice in combat (for example do you want your shotgun alt fire to shoot a grenade? or instead fire 3 quick charged shots. Then, apply useful upgrades to each of those).   Well hidden secrets and challenges in each level top things off to create my biggest and most pleasant gaming surprise in 2016.

TL;DR: DOOM 4 singleplayer is fun as ♥♥♥♥ and it's good, multiplayer is mediocre, snapmap is p gud.  Honestly when they announced and showed off DOOM 4 I wasn't impressed, what's this bull ♥♥♥♥ glory kills? why is it slow? I play ALOT of doom 1-2 and still do to this day using Zandronum. But after playing through the single player and 100%ing it, I can say that it's a blast. It's a lot faster than it seemed when they showed it, the action is fast paced and brutal.  Yes it is a modernized DOOM, but that's not really a bad thing when it's done right, if you want to play classic doom, just go play classic doom man. Glory kills are almost completely optional (bosses require it to FINISH them off) but I never found myself really getting tired of all the different ways Doom guy can murder a demon, sometimes it feels good to get up close and personal!   The maps are mostly nonlinear in exploration and the secrets are all pretty damn good, I had to go to some maps several times to find them on my own, the game kept getting more interesting at it went on, none of the maps felt too similar to each other.  We see a lot of returning weapons with a modern flash, with some weapon mods to spice things up. The guns felt great to use for the most part and most of them have 2 different mods to choose from, allowing for a secondary function. Being able to upgrade your armor and weapons is a welcome change in my opinion, fully upgraded you feel stronger, but not cheaply invincible, especially on higher difficulties.  The singleplayer is a love letter to first person shooters in this modern age, maybe we'll see more of it. Multiplayer on the other hand is pretty forgettable, the net code or something feels off and the modern 'load out' function is 'eh' I don't really have much to say about it, it's fun in short bursts but it's not really something many people will find themselves playing all night.  Snap map is pretty interesting and has a lot of options on creating unique levels, I spent a couple hours in it and made a map and found it to be kinda fun, a bit clunky to use but legit none the less. I never really mastered it or played too many maps but I really liked it, don't have much else to say.  Also the added lore is pretty decent, doom boy is a fantastic protag, A+",

[SP][Checkpoints]  This is just a personel thing for me but I hate the idea of checkpoints, sure there handy but I much rather manually save like the original doom. sure it prevents 'save-scumming' but why should the devs care about that when it comes to the game as a whole, and the checkpoints tend to be fairly far appart as a note. why they didn't include both, who knows...

Apparently, games and gaming develop new ideas relatively slowly, because although I thought I remembered exactly what it felt like to play the first generation shooters, I was initially stunned when faced with a cutting edge, modernized version of the simplistic format in the DOOM reboot.  Like so many have already observed, it's basically fast-paced closed area arena combat - one after another. Repeat. Prepare for the next battle. But as your skills improve, it grows on you. You start to see little things. Like how much the devs must have enjoyed putting this or that over-the-top display of gore and violence into the design. In the end, It's all about the attitude of the protagonist. Anger could hardly be simpler as a theme and motivation, but it just works. Cranking up the volume, tasting blood in my mouth, I charge into the  face  of the towering monster, tear it to pieces and love it all! ",

There is almost zero opportunity for you to go slow. At first, the game eases you into the idea of getting your @ss handed to you by being pretty laid back with the enemies, to the point you might even be disappointed. After all, DOOM is about waves and waves of enemies, right?   However, somewhere near the end of your first main objective, though, you'll find yourself starting to sweat a bit, even on Ultra-Violence (the first, highest difficulty you can play until you unlock/tweak the higher difficulties)  (I do appreciate any scientific installation that has a 'Demonic Invasion in Progress' warning already cued up, though. So, in the world, someone had to honestly say 'You know, we have all these warnings about disasters... What about if we're overrun with Demons? We should have a warning for that.'... And someone on the Safety Team agreed.)  Overall; there's zero reason to have a plot in this game. I have no idea why they even bothered. DOOM does not need a plot, unless it's to avenge the death of your bunny!  Weapons are, eh. Standard FPS faire, each with a sharp throwback to the originals. Even the current stand in for the BFG is alright. I'm a fan of the Pulse Cannon and the shotgun/mortar combo, personally. Melee being added in makes for some interesting fights, and the Glory Kills never get old.  Where DOOM really shines, though, is the fact that peppered all throughout the game are little touches and throwbacks to the original games, especially once you stumble into Hell -- which, to date, is probably my favorite rendition, even beating out Painkiller.  Is the game worth the hype? Hell Yes. It just depends on how much 'HYPE' you pay attention to. it's a shooter that requires at least a bit of strategy for each room; can't say that about too many FPS' today. The real clincher for me is that there were plenty of points where I forgot precisely how long I was playing -- this goes for SP and MP as well. If nothing else, that's a mark of quality.",

Additionally, while this is an FPS that encourages you to move quickly and dispatch your foes with overwhelming firepower (see Super Shotgun in mouth), the Codex also speaks about weaknesses that can be exploited in your enemies.

I don't like the new 3D map either. I thinkit actually makes it more difficult to find your way around.  Overall lots of fun if you just want to do a bunch of fragging.",

The story is pretty much literally thrown out the window! And that is just the way it should be.  The guns feel hefty and that makes it great to shoot things. Each weapon also has two weapon mods for alternate fire modes. Also back is finding many secrets, with expansive levels full of nooks and crannies to explore. Technically the game performs marvellously, with 70-80 fps on my GTX 970 on 1440p and more importantly: no hiccups.  Doomguy must be pretty angry, since he just rips demons in half with his bare hands... New to the game are glory kill executions that fortunately animate swiftly, and grant the player health and (later on) armor. So as long as you are slaughtering demons without getting hit too much, you can keep your dance of death going. The selection of demons hasn't been changed all that much (mostly DOOM and DOOM II enemies), but they do have received more interesting movement patterns and some new attacks.  Also new, are some very interesting weapon and character upgrades that require you to skillfully kill demons with the weapons' alternate fire modes, as well as arcade style challenge arena's that require you to skillfully kill demons.   The multiplayer is not very interesting (although perfectly funtionable), but the single player is absolutely fantastic. A great way to channel any agressive feelings you might have. :) There's also Snapmap that allows you to create, share and play user created maps. I have not tried Snapmap yet as of writing. What I miss the most is campaign coop, although Snapmap does support coop with up to 4 players.  All in all: what a blast, DOOM is back! Highly recommended game.",

Еще хуже стало в плане сомнений после мультиплеерной беты. Честно, не знаю что сподвигло на приобретение игры после всего этого (может в подкорку въелось со старых времен) но поднапрягся с финансами, жабой и купил. С самого начала не заладилось, начались дикие заморозки с самго старта игры, лагало начиная с заставок спонсоров и непосредственных участников до меню. Скачал новые драйвера для 970-го и проблемы исчезли (в очередной раз неприятный осадок от Nvidia, расслабились ребята в последнее время). По привычке выставил настройки по возможному макисмум, чтобы посмотреть как будет вести себя игра. Зажожу в игру и понеслась... Тормозов нет, нет вообще. Сколько бы на меня кого не нападало, чем бы не швырялись/били - проседаний нет. Однозначно 5 за оптимизацию. Но все это отходит на второй план (опять же благодаря оптимизации) примерно через 10-15 мин. Начал на nightmare, через короткий промежуток времени решил все же спуститься с небес и освоиить даног забытые азы. Это DOOM, ребята это он.",

And I don't like Team Deathmatch. I'm an objective style player ala capture the flag etc.   You cannot choose the game type specifically, as it is bundled into groups, and the fact that I can't find a match means I have never actually been able to find out if they are even any good!

It was written and recorded by Mick Gordon, and he really outdid himself. When I can buy this soundtrack I'll probably listen to it daily for a few months while driving or working.  One thing that is a little disapointing in this game is the enemy design. IMHO the enemies in Doom 3 almost all looked scarier and more horrifying than in this game. Doom 4 seems to want to take cues from super colorful and somewhat cartoonish games like Sunset Overdrive and Borderlands. The imps were very scary and alien in Doom 3; now they are bright purple and orange elves. The Barons of Hell look like Tim Curry in Legend. The final boss was not scary or cool looking at all; in fact I was sure I while I was playing the last boss that they'd have something cooler afterward just because of how lame it was. With the exception of the Revenant and the Hell Knights all of the enemies in this new Doom look kind of cartoonish and silly. The lower-level cannon fodder enemies all look stright out of Sunset Overdrive. They look super out of place in Doom. It isn't a horrible thing, but it detracts a bit. This game with Doom 3's enemy design would have been better.",

            "review_text": "Ever since it's announcement since last year's E3, I've been looking forward to it. Every piece of footage they've shown since then has gotten me even more hyped for it. When they said they were holding review copies until release, even I was scared. Scared but hopeful. I've been playing the original doom games since i was young, they're some of the finest games ever made, and I was hoping so much that this would be good.  Then it came out.  And it's completely blown me away  I'm incredibly happy with this game. I've been wanting a game like this for a long time, and finally, i've gotten an amazing one. It's just demons, guns, gore, and a good bit of story for those interested  The single player is undoubtable the main selling point of the game, and best part of the experience. It alone is well worth the price of admission. With a length of around 10-16 hours for your first playthrough, not a single moment was boring. Every second of this game is exhilerating and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ amazing. Weapons are satisfying to shoot, enemies are satisfying to kill, even the pre-canned execution animations are so fast they don't break up the pace of the game at all.  This game makes you feel POWERFUL, but soft. You can ♥♥♥♥ up enemies in record times with powerful weaponry, but on harder difficulties you are also quite squishy yourself, which combined with the speed of the game makes an extremely skill-based experience (A quick note, the game feels a lot faster with a high FOV. It's not super slow at 90, by any means, but at 130, you rEALLY feel the rush of moving extra fast, and it makes it more enjoyable). The weapon attachments are a nice touch to the game, along with the armor upgrades, adds for a bit of nice progression through the story, that can be completely ignored if you want of course. The enemy types from the originals are all there too, colorful and with great silouhettes and sound effects that let you know what you're going up against. They all have a really nice redesign, but elements of the original design are kept, that make many of them instantly recognizable as the classic demons you know and love. They have excellent AI too, they don't all just run at you blindly, they all act differently, be they an imp, running away and grabbing walls to line up a good shot, or a hell knight, relentlessly hounding you and attempting to beat your face in. They're all expertly designed to make you prioritize targets and make the senseless ripping and tearing a bit more strategic. The music is absolutely amazing too. It's not quite as memorable a soundtrack as the original's, but it's a fantastic mix of metal and electronic, that's brutal as hell and ABSOLUTELY matches up with everything that's going on onscreen. The boss fights, the few there are, are reALLY GOOD. They could be a bit harder, but I'm willing to bet they'll be harder to deal with in Nightmare (of which, i played ultra violence). But they're all really cool, with multiple attacks and the works. They're ABSOLUTELY good boss fights, and are very fun to fight, but there are some ways they could've been improved upon to make them even better. Though even with that, they're the best boss fights in the entire series.  The lore, what little there is, is actually very interesting to me. It's by no means extensive, but as a fan of being able to read up on lore of doom 3, the little bit of reading there is to do for every monster in this game satisfied me greatly. A little bit of context and story is good enough for me. The characters are nearly as intriguing as the demons, and i loooove reading up on the demons. The doomguy himself is given an interesting backstory, but doesn't talk, and through just his body language you can get more character from him than most big budget ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t exposition machines. Besides that, there are VERY FEW story sequences which lock you in rooms and require you to listen to exposition. And the few there are are pretty much all within the first few levels of the game, so it's not all that bad.  There are secrets too, you're rewarded with health, ammo, and even some classic doom levels you can mess around in, like in wolfenstein.   I think i've gotten through everything good I wanted to say, so now onto some of the bad things (what few there are). For one, there are a few graphical and audio glitches here and there. Every now and then it's easy to run into a physics glitch where a body will get stuck in the geometry and make some noise. but these aren't very bad, and barely hinder the game's experience, if at all. The bosses I enjoyed fighting, but theres one boss that I'm legitimately surprised they left out. I was almost certain they'd have the icon of sin in as an actual boss. I know it was just a wall in doom 2, but with what they did with the other bosses, I'm sure they could've found a way to make a modern icon of sin fight. A damn good one at that. But it only shows up as an environmental thing near the end of the game, though honestly with an extremely amusing easter egg attached to it. This also feeds into how I feel the boss fights could've been improved overall. They're GREAT, and absolutely fun, but each one is just in a circular fighting arena, and i feel like they could've been improved if lengthened, and put in bigger areas that allow for more running around, perhaps mixed with some regular enemies as well. They also don't have the arachnotrons anymore, though in the end I still had 2 slots in the beastiary empty, so I don't know if or how I missed 2 enemy types, but i doubt they'd be arachnotrons. The level design is great, the arenas and everything are well made and fun to run around in, but it plays a bit in that respect like a serious sam game, where you run through halls with little enemies in them and then the big baddies come out in big fights, which some people may not be a fan of, but I personally feel it matches what this game's going for and works well. But as the game progresses, the level design falters a little bit. They're by no means just infinite straight hallways like other modern fps games, they have secrets and damn good design in general, but they do feel a little linear in that most of the time you do just have a single path open, to which you get a key and then have just 1 more path, and so on and so forth. I definately remember levels like this in the old games, and it isn't quite as bad as doom 3, but I do feel the levels could've had more open levels later on. I also aren't a huge fan of the gauss cannon and the weapon modifications. They're nice, and don't ruin the experience or anything, but i feel like they can get extremely overpowered, especially the gauss cannon, which quite frankly, is a nice weapon, but is so ♥♥♥♥ing over powered i'd rather it just not be in the game at all. The chainsaw is cool, with limited ammo, and giving you ammo drops when you kill enemies, but playing on ultra violence i never really needed it (Though I plan on playing the game through again on Nightmare without any mods or upgrades, so hopefully it'll be more useful there). The bfg having such limited ammo is good too. It's incredibly powerful, to the point where I never wanted to use it though, as it would make things simply too easy. Though again, all of the upgrades and everything is optional, that's why I'm choosing to not use them in the next playthrough.  Now onto the multiplayer and snapmap, of which there isn't much to say really Multiplayer is a bit of fun, but mediocre, not well balanced (due to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t loadouts lmao), and mostly meh. It's a bit of fun here and there but it's probably going to be dead soon so. The snapmap is a harmless addition, it's fun to play around with but lacks the depth to make really good maps. They really should allow better modding   Overall, doom is FANTASTIC. I loved it from start to finish An easy 9/10 for the single player alone  Rip  And  Tear",

Looks great, runs great, gameplay is fast paced and long, easily my pick for GAME OF THE YEAR.  EDIT: After spending some time on multiplayer and reaching level 40, I find that the team balancing in this game is NONE EXISTENCE. It can go very unbalanced like full high level player team vs full newbie or ameteur player team. It is a fun multiplayer shooter but with this kinda ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t it take the fun out of it when all the veteran players just destroy you whenever after you respawn for 10 seconds or less. I am never an experienced player in this kind of multiplayer shooter (Quake, Unreal etc) so I can't fully judge how the system works, but seriously it takes the fun out of it. If this game has some team balancing mechanic where both teams have high and low rank players, the game will totally be more balanced and more fun. Veteran players have more knowledge and skill in the game so their map awareness, item drops, vantage points etc is far more better than new or average players that is just starting to get into this game. The devs for this multiplayer needs to fix this. And as for hackers, I haven actually met one yet.  Overall, the singleplayer campaign is FREAKING AWESOME, and the multiplayer is just DISASTER.",

The game is almost the definition of relentless, brutal action from beginning to (what I imagine will be the end). Some of the battles you face are awe inspiring in terms of the amount of foes and the pace of the combat. The environments are beautiful, and the gun customisation and character customisation is deep. I didn't pay much attention to the story but the character descriptions in the codex is pretty interesting.   The game is very brutal and bloody its very heavy in terms of gun use, but there is a strong melee aspect to it as well. One thing I liked in particular about the melee takedowns was that each enemy has a different character animation in how they are dispatched depending on what part of the body you attack them from i.e. from above or below or from behind.   Only downsides - I think some battles you are overwhelmed by the amount of foes who attack you. Sometimes you think the battle is over then two huge enemy types spawn along with other foes and they need taking down before you can progress. Also I got lost on a few occasions in the game what with all the keycard backtracking and the map I found to be very difficult to navigate.   Frame rate - very smooth in general, some drops in certain areas but solid nonetheless.  A very fast paced, at times unimaginably violent campaign with gore kill after gore kill. A solid return to form for Id.",

This is an excellent twitch game; takes me back to when I was eight years old, and makes me proud I still have the reflexes for it. Your character is a lethal badass that gets right out in the bad guy's face and rips it off. Unrealistic as hell, but also fun as hell, so I won't knock that part.  The part I will knock is... well, all the parts--rare and fleeting as they are--where you are NOT shooting something. Those parts all give me the same feeling as reading the badly-translated package of a cheap Chinese toy. 'Doom Marine'? Fourth wall much? 'Glory Kill'? REALLY? Who in blazes even uses the word 'glory' anymore? Nobody I ever talk to; it's a good way to make something sound childish. Or, okay, Chinese. And that bit where it does this pathetic, kitschy zoom-in of a screaming Imp to call our attention to the new and improved Imp Style... blech. The only thing more sad than a cheap jump-scare is one that fails that hard. Hell, the new Imp doesn't even look that scary; it's like a monkey wearing a Star Warsy mask. And that scream? N  So whenever the action starts, I get a hell of a rush; whenever it stops, it's just, 'What the hell?'

Most people would say to buy it just for the single player. I say buy it for both SP and MP!   Now onto technical issues (Yaaaay!) - Exclusive fullscreen mode rarely works, therefore v-sync on/off makes no difference. G-Sync does not work at all [You might be better off without it for faster response times, but G-Sync should work regardless.] There are reports of very long loading times. Not everyone is affected. There are reports of mouse smoothing at default. This isn't true. The game just doesn't have the same snappy responsiveness as Source-based games like CSGO. Just a caution: Doom can crash to the desktop at any given time. It's very annoying and, from the looks of it, it's a common problem for many players.  Optimization - Framerate is almost always above 80 fps on Ultra settings on these PC specs: i5-4460, GTX 970 SSC, 8GB DDR3, 1TB HDD. No major hitching or stuttering. Just random crashes to desktop.  Conclusion - Doom is great and gives a nod to the classics. The beginning is kind of a slow burn. Don't worry, it gets better. If you're looking for a deep story, find something else. Right now the game is prone to random crashes and long loading times (nearly 5 minutes) for a lot of players. Mine is only prone to just the crashes. It's been 2 weeks and the devs still haven't figured out the cause of either of them. I wouldn't recommend buying Doom at this time as it still suffers from day 1 bugs. I recommend the game overall because, eventually, the game will get patched. Everything else is well-made.  UPDATE (2016-06-19) - Crashes are still present. I got G-Sync working. Just had to force enable a setting in Doom's Nvidia profile (Global settings were being overridden).  UPDATE (2016-08-14) - Crashes are supposedly fixed.

            "review_text": "** See my comment below   Single player only review.  Doom (2016) is truly worthy of carrying the legendary name. It feels like a spiritual successor to Doom 2, with a few bits of Doom 3 and Quake (Quad Damage baby!) thrown in.  This is in the same fine caliber of remakes/reboots as Wolfenstein: New Order, which is one of the best single player FPS games I've played in recent years.  The FPS mechanics are close to perfect. At first I frowned at the double jumping and ledge climbing, but soon realized how these mechanics helped keep the pace of the fights high, as your great freedom of movement on all 3 axis pretty much always leaves you somewhere to go, even when you're not familiar with the layout of the map.   The level design is actually pretty reminiscent of Doom 2, with both narrow corridors and large open areas. Plenty of secret areas to explore, which gets rewarded well.  The good old gang of monsters and weapons are back (with some additions), and they all look, sound and handle superbly. This is pure no-nonsense, balls to the wall, Doom action with just a bare minimum of story and cutscenes.   Generally you'll face fewer, but tougher versions of the hordes from hell. The 'Baron of Hell' is pretty fearsome now, so it feels better than ever to pick up a 'Beserk' powerup, put a grin on your face and blast your 1-hit death machine fist into his sorry face.  The game is impressively true to it's herritage, even though the old dog HAS learned a few modern tricks...   Health and ammo no longer has to come from traditional pickups. Damage a monster so it almost dies, and it staggers for some seconds, during which you can perform a 'Glory Kill' by using your melee attack. This triggers a badass gory kill animation, and results in some dropped health.  The trusty old chainsaw has become a fuel guzzler, but in return it makes the sliced foes drop ammo. The tougher the enemy is to cut through, the more fuel the saw consumes.  All weapons (except for the pistol) have 2 unlockable modifications, and each of these mods have 4 upgrades. The first three upgrades are unlocked by spending weapon upgrade tokens, which are rewarded by fulfilling challenges, finding secrets and having some sort of algoritm evaluate your performance at the end of each level. The final upgrade level of each gun is unlocked by completing a challenge related to the usage of that specific weapon mod. Some of the mods are friggin' kickass, and really help keep things fresh and varied as you progress.  Your suit too has upgrades. Four categories of them actually, and these are unlocked via Praetor tokens, which are found on the corpses of Elite Guards.  Even passive 'perks' are introduced in the form of 'Runes' which are unlocked on special challenge maps accessed through portals. These runes can also be upgraded by fulfilling challenges. You start with 1 rune slot, but can unlock up to 3 slots.  And finally your max health, armor and ammo capacity is upgraded by finding and collecting 'Argent Cells' which are spread across the maps.  At the end of each level you can see how many exploration items you missed.  Overall the presentation is great. The id Tech engine performs excellent, so the awesome detailed artwork never once stuttered on MAX settings in 1200p on my GTX 980ti. I loved the industrial/metal themed soundtrack, but I reckon it might annoy the more faint eared folks out there :) It sets the mood perfectly regardless.  One of my few complaints is that I would've loved a thick layer of badass cutscene driven story full of colorful characters. If it can be done in a Wolfenstein remake, it can be done in the Doom universe as well.  The game crashed to desktop 4-5 times during my 10 hour playthrough, which never happened for me with previous id Tech powered titles.  That aside, it's my pick for best single player FPS of the year. Well done id Software - you're still a force to be reckoned with.  93%",

Hell, if you're here, you probably know it's great already, as there's nothing but praise for this game out there, and for good reason. There really is not much I can say about the gameplay that hasn't been said already. The shooting feels amazing. The maps are very well-designed and every encounter is filled with gory joy, though one complaint that I do have have regarding gameplay is that there's too much downtime between fights, whereas the original Doom had almost no downtime at all unless you killed everything on the level already. The music is amazing and fits the gameplay perfectly, and the sound design is great in general, especially on the guns (as you might imagine, that's important on a game that focuses on shooting and not much else). The game is very well-optimized, and I noticed very few bugs, none of which interfered with gameplay. Overall, this is easily one of the best titles this year.  HOWEVER, and that's a big however, the recent update that introduced Vulkan also introduced always-on DRM to go with Vulkan, meaning that if your internet is down and you wanna play DOOM, you'll have to play an inferior version of it because the performance gains from Vulkan are quite significant, especially for AMD cards. Now, some people might live in the illusion that everyone has a perfect internet connection, but that's not true. Some people live in rural areas, some people live in developing countries, some people just have a bad ISP, and even those who have a generally solid internet connection will lose it sometimes due to technical difficulties on the ISP's part or problems with their router. Point is, not everyone has reliable access to the superior version of DOOM, and for no good reason. DOOM's single-player has nothing to do with online connectivity. To lock enhanced performance behind an online connection that doesn't contribute to that enhanced performance is strictly ANTI-CONSUMER. Make no mistake, this decision was made to fight piracy. Unfortunately, it also hurts paying customers. It treats everyone like criminals, except pirates didn't pay for the product. Paying customers did. Thus, by punishing both equally as much, the side that really gets hurt are the paying customers. Does it make some would-be pirates pay for the product? of course, but then, they become paying customers and are punished for it, thus discouraging them from paying for more products of the same publisher in the future.   To conclude this rant, you should know that if you are buying this game, you are validating an anti-consumer practice, effectively telling Bethesda/Zenimax and potentially other publishers 'this is profitable! you should do it more!'.",

Due to lack of mod support I wouldn't expect to get much more value out of it, and for the same reason multiplayer won't be modded into anything serviceable - and as it is now it's an imbalanced CoD clone with demons.  Those 10 hours will be really fun though, all meat and no bones. Cutscenes/exposition are adding up to maybe 5 minutes in total. Funny though, that when they happen all exits are locked as if they knew that EVERYONE would skip them.",

This is a proper SP FPS with none of the linear set pieces of modern shooters. None of that 'follow me for twenty minutes and shoot when I say', none of this stealthy stealthy shushy shushy nonsense.  You wake up, you pick up a gun, and you shoot demons. And thats pretty much it. the guns get bigger, as do the demons, and at times it gets pretty hectic with spawns happening all around you.  There is a much greater sense of using the environment to stay alive, its almost parkour, but parkour with rocket launchers.  As an oldie who remembered the originals when they were just that, this game is definitely more Doom than 3, which had you corridor shooting your way through predictable spawns (usually at the back of you). This has wide open spaces, indoor and out, with a fantastic array of iconic demons, incoming fire you can dodge, secrets galore and some great meaty gun effects.  What they added, works. Weapons that have dual modes lending a great amount of tinkering on the players part, upgrades to the suit, Runes, and the controversial melee system serves to keep the action flowing by dropping health and ammo, pushing you relentlessly forward.  Played 5.7 hours, so far on level 4 as I've been searching for the secrets as I go, and loving it. ",

Doom is a fun action packed fast paced game, and I stood by my opinion even during the hate Armageddon that was the beta. Granted there are still ignorant people that will just hate on the game despite its recently popularity and positive feedback. This game can definitely be held up by itself just with the campaign, it is somewhat reparative but you should play it in small increments, akin to LA noire. Unlocking upgrades and exploring the map even when you have killed all the enemies is fun to, finding Easter eggs and necessities are helpful and entertaining. The multilayer is also fun, but its just an add on to the game, sort of like sprinkles on a cake.",

Some sections of the game are devoid of all ambient sounds, the main menu is laggy as hell when you first launch the game, first load time takes forever. Weapon graphics look bizare sometimes (plasma rifle shots just look weird). It feels like a lot of the guns are desynced from the sounds being played too.  Because the game is an action romp, the action can sometimes be almost too fast. A lot of the gameplay basically comes down to 20-30 seconds of hectic moving around and shooting. Some people may like this, as it feels like Serious Sam, but I just don't like the pacing. Essentially, fights are a contained area/arena that you have to navigate around before moving on to the next area.  The story itself is just weird. I can get weird stories, but DOOMs just -really- makes zero sense. The in-game entries are a nice touch, but often times just leave me scratching my head for one reason or another. Also, about the entries, a lot of them typos...  Theres a lot of meaningless side-stuff to do like timed trials. I just don't understand what the point of these were for as it feels like they break up the pace of the game and serve as a distraction. You can actually play through the game without doing any of the trials.  Honestly, the majority of the game's difficulty comes from having to maximize the Doom Marine's health, armor, and ammunition pools. Once you have one of those maxed out, the game becomes fairly easy. Seems like a really lazy way to make the game hard, but there you go.  Overall:  It's an okay game but there are other games like it that are better. Serious Sam, Painkiller, etc. Might as well just play the original Doom too. I wouldn't recommend Doom 2016 though.",

If you played the original dooms and have been thinking about this, go for it, it's really good .... and by good ... I mean evil &gt;:)  10 Chainsaws / 10 - Would chainsaw again",

My reveiw of the game is solely with respect to the fact that it is catastrophically bug ridden.  I have never seen a game Crash To the Desktop and also Hard Crash causing your computer to Lock up needing to be reset so many times. It occurs every time you play mutltiple times. Bethesda and ID have attempted to use us all as Guinea Pigs by installing a Crash Tool into the DOOM Executable and it in fact is bug ridden code. I personally did not have any Crashes or problems with the game after 20+ hours. Then they updated the game with this Crash logging tool that destroyed my game. It has been several days now and they havnt fixed the tool and it looks like the have no intention on removing it. I cannot reccomend the purchase of DOOM in this condition. It is the worst Game I have ever played EVER Crashing constantly. The thing is they are not Crashes in the since that my computer logs a hardware failure or software failure. Windows 10 is so sensitive to problems with both and will report problems but when DOOM crashes there is no trace what so ever from Windows 10 unless you have to Reset. I am almost at the very end of the game and I wish I could tell you how much I enjoyed it. If it was not Crash Ridden I would give the game 10/10. It is the exact DOOM I would have wanted for the Campaign part of it. I havnt played multiplayer yet. So It cannot actually be rated in its technical condition. I am really fearing this is going to be another Batman Arkham Knight moment where the Developers give up and just say too bad we cant fix it. I really am afraid this will happen. They have had time to make some progress by now and they should be telling people right here in Steam that they are making progress. They are leaving it all a mystery. What an absolute shame to all the Artists. The Art of the Game and the Creative Part of the game is being wasted by the flawed Engine. I do not reccomend buying it now. :(  Now after playing through the Campain 3 Times at over 100 hours of gameplay Deleting my Profile Completely essentially Reloading the Game without a doubt I am right.   If you want to play the Multi Player and thats pretty much it , and there are a lot of people that are only interested in that, then the game runs fine.   It is only the Campaign Single Player that is trashed. No matter what you do with your Hardware will not matter the game will still Crash every single time you play at least 1 time. That ruins the entire experience.   Last thing man. DOOM as been sold as the Most Awesome Gaming Experience to Date and I would have to pretty much agree. My Computer runs it like they show it in their Demos. Hell , I want to play it right now but I will wait now I think we are going on 2 months with out a patch. I will wait to see if they actually fix it before I play again .  I would not buy it unless you are prepared to submit crash logs Manually because their Crash Logging Tool Freezes and doesnt do what it supposed to.   Would I buy DOOM having know this at this point ? NO . I would have waited until they Patched it and I could have firm evidence that the Random CTD issue was corrected.",

Cons: Biggest issue is the campaign.

On the highest difficulty (EXCLUDING perma-death mode), the game is super tense with every fight potentially being the last.   There are some additional bonus things to do in the game that give levels replayability, such as completing all the challenges in a level if you missed them (which normally pertain to finding secrets or killing a typeof demon in a particular way), finding the health/armor/ammo upgrades, and weapon mods. DOOM 2016 gives you so many new and fun options to shoot things, it's great! Heck, the Glory Killing mechanic is a lot of fun too, since it's a fast execution of an enemy, and it doesn't feel like it breaks the quick pace of the game.  There are also custom maps with workshop content that you can make (also multiplayer potential), and a multiplayer team deathmatch with objectives for when you want to break from the campaign (or want more than the campaign, with the custom maps). They can feel rather bare-bones.. but it's certainly a good alternative.   So the review is lookin' like I would recommend the game--- but I can't. Not right now.  This game is absolutely  packed  with game-breaking bugs for me.  I haven't looked or asked around if anyone has the same issues as me, but the game is frustratingly difficult because of the following bugs.  I'm not alone with most of these issues!   *NOTE: If I were better at fps games and was NOT playing on the hardest difficulty, bugs related to death are less an issue*    Frequent random game crashes    Checkpoints not functioning, making deaths far more punishing than they should be    Glory Killing (executing) certain enemies on inclines can put me out of bounds (thus killing me)    VERY often I just fall through the floor because quicksand idk (killing me again)    Moving platforms and objects  always grab  me if I brush up against them, which carries me to my death, or flat-out gibs me (killing me some more)    Standing on top of a moving platform sometimes causes me to innexpicably explode (no rest for the wicked)    Two updates ago, checkpoints did not function at all for me, and dying would reset my game (and boy, do I die a lot)    Last update fixed the above issue, but then deleted part of my game progression (which while sucky, I could at least play the game again)    The sound my character makes when he double jumps plays a sharp, quiet-yet-ear-piercing sound that I couldn't work around, even after customer service tried to help me, which is likely a hardware issue on my end    Random crash after finishing the first mission on perma-death mode, which leads me to believe that I will not be playing that mode anytime soon   Gosh darnit please fix this game up more.  Do not buy the game until the price goes down, or if you REALLY like DOOM and a simple-shooter with some exploration, buy it when all the bugs are patched up.

Now much like so in Doom, Pinky is not a joke anymore, and using the shotgun actually matters now especially considering he would shrug off your weapons from the front unless you shot at it's weak spot.  It's such a mixed but still a great experience nonetheless, you're placed into levels still designed much like how Doom 3 was except you're still running around and killing demons instead of occasionally dodging into cover while moving rather slowly unless you used sprint which would be limited unless you were in the Hell levels. In this game? You are ALWAYS running, much like how it always should be in our shooter games, cause we all know damn well enough it doesn't fit into an 'FPS' game like you know, CoD.  And listen to me when I say this, when I say that you HAVE to keep moving, you HAVE too unless you want to die pretty quickly, cause the demons in this game are in a completely different kind of ambushing strategy, and it works!  I haven't spent enough time yet for both multiplayer and the snapmap mode but surely enough after I felt I spent enough time I will provide information about that, but so far, yes! This Doom is actually worth getting! Though I would still wait at least a little bit until the prices drop at least like, 20%, but either way, the single-player mode itself alone still has a LOT to offer, mostly it being map exploration, a map system you can actually check out on, secret areas, secret levels, collectible DoomGuy action figures!

The flaws are fixable so maybe they will make a few patches for these problems,or just leave them to the community like bethesda always do.Anyway i think this game and Total War Warhammer are the only games worth buying in this summer.And as a first person shooting game,DOOM can be much better than FO4 as a RPG.",

As big the franchise and name appears to be, it became also the first game to support one of the newest API's that would put down any complications towards performance any systems could have.  It would be hypocrite to call this unbiased, but for as much of a revolution this title provides for PC gamers being beautiful all around, quality content, expected multiplayer, ability to extend it's life with map creation and generally be PC oriented, modding will be expected. It's 2016, DLC's will unfortunately be perhaps expensive but provide you even more reasons to keep going back into it.   I wouldn't expect multiplayer to be competitive in it's currente state, but if really quake players and other genres wishes, there is always a possibility to change the way this game behaves and shape it to the liking of a competitive manner (If allowed, without complications.), this is 'PC gaming'. Faster movement, arena dominance, skill based plays, strategy beyond hesitation and timing, all are a possibility, but most important, 'Performance' is absolutely beyond it's latest limitations, there is no reasons why would DOOM itself get the awkward eye for being as unoptimized like all of the older titles we have been provided in the last years be running at. We all know that when something gets serious, it needs to be as flawless as possible. DOOM does that and for me, this is why I would give it literally the highest rating possible without forgetting the little flaws it habits in itself until they are addressed. Please, don't let this game die, ever. This is what every gamer could wish for in terms of service. There hasn't been such in a 'LONG' time.",

The developer attitude towards the player might best be summarized by the unskippable dancing company logos when the game is launched. The entire game is like that: for every cool or beautiful gameplay element there's something that's decidedly player-unfriendly.  Bits of story text are collected and viewed in a tiny window on an otherwise unused screen, forcing the player to scroll through as few as three paragraphs of story. The 'glory kills' basically pause the game for 2-3 seconds every time, and like... Near the beginning there's an elevator. Push the button, wait for it to arrive, get in, push the button, wait for it to close the doors, wait for it to move to another floor. At the end of a short hallway, literally the only thing on this level, there's a key. Back to the elevator, push the button, wait, resume playing.  None of these things are game breakers, but they keep piling up, like a heap of tiny offenses and after two hours I found I was basically playing it angry, it wasn't fun.

This game is nothing in comparison to a Half-Life experience. The levels are very similar and repetative, though insert a new gun or monster per level; rinse and repeat. The game is fun but nothing special pulls you in; you just shoot monsters and read a vague dialogue of some employee on occasion. There's no real story aside from some weird spinoff copycat of doom 3 or so it seems (I never bothered to finish the game). The fact that you can't save on your own was always frustrating as well. I understand they may want to implement some other forms of difficulty but lets be real, it's just an inconvenience and rather annoying to repeat 30 minutes of work scouting secrets and carefully playing the game after accidentally jumping to your death.  I've loved doom since the very original but this DOOM didn't really offer much. I suppose it's why my friends never really made it past beta. If you can purchase this game for a discount, I'd say try it out. Definitely not a $60 game though.",

I started the game right off on Ultra-Violence, and man what a rush. The game primarly focuses on movement, just like the classics. If you stop, you've literally painted a target on yourself. The maps are huge! Almost adding a sense of open-world type exploration, to linear style maps. (Bioshock if you will.) With every shot you take, the weapons feel powerful, and each have their own unique advantages and disadvantages, depending on the situation you're in. Not like a batch of bland weaponary, that's in most of today's shooters. I honestly haven't had this much fun with a shooter, in a very long time.

I feel that this game's environment was very, VERY placid and child friendly. The original DOOM is like a psychos idea of a video game. I was hoping for something along those lines.   The play controls are not good enough. Even though I would say this game is a good port for the PC rest assured this game still feels like a console game. It just has that icky console feel to the controls. Jumping for instance is SOOO BAD. It's setup to be used with a joystick not WASD. It feels like Metroid or something... like really?  The sound is OK but it's not great, only in a few instances are sound effects really cool, usually they seem kind of like duds. PUT SOME REAL EFFORT INTO THE SOUND. 'The audience is listening.' -THX  Most of the demons are good though a few are kind of corny. One great touch is that every demon has their own glory kills, that makes it quite a bit more humorous and interesting to engage in glory kills. But the demons aren't very scary at all, I was hoping they would be more terrifying. Unfortunately they're a little tame looking all in all.  Despite the drawbacks it IS a good game, it just isn't a 'wow'. It's a very generic game wearing some DOOM makeup. It's not actual balls out psychotic as hell DOOM.

The oldskool area 'hold-the-fire-button-and-run' shooter is back! The story was flimsy, the exposition and plot twists about as exciting as a Teletubbie episode. Just the way I like it because that just means there's more time for great graphics, intuitive gameplay and non-stop action packed missions. And of course all of the OG favorites are back like the Pinky's, revenants and Caco demons.  Definately worth giving up daylight for.  But of course there's also multiplayer...and that's where the ball was dropped...forgotten and erased from memory. Let me eleborate: The first few weeks I had a blast. Running for powerups while dodging rockets and unleashing a quad damage chaingun. It's like the area shooter never left! But then the fire nation attacked...errr wait... server logic happened. There apears to be no ranking system whatsover, meaning one round you play with pro's and the next round it's glue sniffing n00bs as far as the Railgun can shoot. No consistency in the ranking of players or lobbies. Just chuck people in a lobby and have fun (or don't). But at least you could play. Since a few weeks even finding the glue sniffers has become a real time consuming task. If you're lucky you'll find a full lobby within 15 minutes. If, off course they stay and wait the (90!!!) second interval between each match.  So if you want a kickass single player, buy it and have a blast. If you want multiplayer, you're about 2 months too late because the MP community is populated by tumbleweeds and chirping crickets.",

After 15 hours of gameplay, and great hopes for reaching hours double, if not triple this, I ran into game crashes. I paid $90 AUD for this game (UAC Edition) and loved every moment until a specific point in the campaign where for no apparent reason (No CPU or GPU bottlenecks to be found) the game crashes after 10 minutes of play. This is extremely frustrating considering not only the amount of money I spent, but the amount of fun I was having as well. I would love a patch for this game, and when a patch comes along which allows me to continue my doom endevours, this review will dramatacally change.

Vulkan certainly shows great promise. for this same reason i bought the Talos Principal although the Vulkan performance there is terrible and so is the game, i still don't much mind throwing away the money to get a glimpse of Vulkan in action.  as for the gameplay, the action is pretty good, very much like Serious Sam, run through and beat 'em up or shoot 'em up pretty much the whole way. the bossfights were boring. the upgrade system was fairly painless as those things go but i could have totally done without it. and it would have certainly seemed much more like old-school-classic-DOOM without that extraneous rpg element.  i'm not even going to go into the multiplayer nor the snapmap thing becuase i believe neither adds anything to the replayability. snapmap is extremely limited in it's scope and multiplayer is a clusterfu_ck, as with any pvp.  bottom line: way too little content for the money. if i was you i would wait to pick it up for ten bucks. unless you just want to show off your hardware, it is good for that purpose.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ID software's Doom, Doom II and Doom 3 are all great games and i revisit each of them each to this day.  this game, Doom 4 or Doom 2016 or whatever they want to call it, really doesn't have much more going for it than lush graphics and a single play-through of the campaign.  the multiplayer is just plain ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and there won't be a soul playing it, this time next year, if there is anyone playing it, even now.  the map editor turned out to be overly simplistic and severely limited in scope, not really useful for anything. which leaves the prospects of co-op replayability pretty bleak as well.  i finished the campaign and i see nothing to return to this game for, nor can i recommend it to my friends.  my advice is to wait until the price of this game slips under ten bucks and you may not feel so bad about the purchase later. i think i paid thirty or forty bucks for it and i almost fully regret the purchase although admittedly my main motive for buying it was to witness the Vulkan performance (which was really the one thing that did not dissapoint).  the campaign was not altogether bad but it was very short and very repetitious with every level being set up essentially the same way and looking so similar that it's actually easy to get lost on a lot of the maps, which i almost never do in games.  ID software is now nothing but a namesake and it clearly shows in this game.",

Nobody cares, but the kiddy voice overs for demons are annoying.   Gunplay isn't as fluid as in other comparable shooters (don't even get me started with the original). Annoying animations that will either get you killed, or bore you to tears after 10 hours of seeing them (thank you modern day shooters)    The UGLY    Map design is pretty bad.  90% of your fights with demons are in quake-style arena maps   that have been copied and pasted over and over again. No sense of immersion, lame exploration (compared to old doom) and extreme laziness (reuse, tedious, predictable paths, you can tell a lot was automatically generated).   The soundtrack for this game is GODAWFUL. Once you get half way through it sounds like a cat getting murdered by a pair of scissors on a chalkboard. I had to turn it off.

Update: I still have a lot of beef with this game, having finally been able to play it, i've found some elements of the game dissapointing, some ok. As a long standing doom player since the 90's this game for me has failed to bring back what I loved about the classic games, I understand time moved on and new things not previously possible are now being acieved, but I feel that the game did lose some of its identity along the way. The game was enjoyable to start with, however as time wore on, it lost its charm and i quickly grew bored and even down right frustrated at how impossible some areas of the game can be on anything other than easy.

Buying a physical boxed copy of the game still requires you to download the game. Can not choose to not download patches and while downloading patches can not play the game.  I guess this is considered normal nowadays... a lot has changed over the years, not for the better.  Technical achievements that have gone into this game engine is very impressive, but since the game is bascially unplayable it's gone to waste.  Edit: elaboration on my beef with gameplay:  Almost an hour into the game I am still running around with the starting shotgun. This gun has only room for 20 ammo at a time, which on the one hand is ok-ish because it keeps things interesting, but it didn't work for me like that.  Secondly the health regain mechanic I do not like compared to what I am used to from the earlier dooms. I rather have big chunks of health instead of small bits after killing enemies.  Also, I did not like the 'jumping game' where I needed to very precisely jump on platforms and ledges, this takes away the fast paced gameplay. Not to mention the inconsistency where you are on some locations able to reach places and other times, seemingly similar in terms of height/reachability, there is an invisibile wall.  Then there were weird quirks with map interface. I did like the method of highlighting where you have been and the fact that you can swich from top down 2d-ish to bridseye 3d view. However I was disappointed when I couldn't find out how to rotate the map if at all possible. The limit on how far you can zoom out didn't make me happy either.  Positive things, the graphics quality and framerate are amazing and so is the music score as far as I heard it.  Concluding, my expectations we different in that I wanted to have an adranaline rush hack and slash experience through the game like I got to know and love in the older versions. Instead I found myself being annoyed and that's not how I want to spend my time (nor money, but that can't be reverted). In hindsight I should have tried the demo first, but again my expectations for this product were very high based on previous versions.  Regarding the physical copy thing, feeling mislead is one thing but now even I am not going to be playing this game I am unable to give it away to somebody who would otherwise not be able to afford it and I think that's a shame.",

I can't play the game otherwise and as such I won't recommend it till after the point that I can actually play the best game series ever.  The engine that the game uses had FPS locks before being further worked on for the game. So it shouldn’t have them but it clearly does. So whens the update to fully optimise such things? Or is it even possible to do this? ID?  (8/28-29%)  I tried Snapmap. MY FPS is about 120 on average from about ten maps, not including one where it dropped down to 50 at its lowest but that map was hectic and smooth! So why can't the story be the same?  The stuff you can do in Snapmap though! I ended up building a few maps and adjusting others. The editor is almost worth the price alone! So I'm changing it from not recommended to almost perfect.  (01/06/2016)  Tried the first level again. It now has no fixed FPS! And secrets could actually be found! Before either the tunnel or the item wasn’t showing up and in the case of the 'classic' there was an invisible wall there. Now all of that is fixed and I could actually play the game. But then level two, 10 FPS??? Your in doors and as such its either less taxing on the computer or its not been optimised at all. But that’s only outside of combat where it still has the 30 FPS lock.   Can anybody figure out what’s wrong here? My computer can play The Witcher 3 on max at the same resolution (1920x1080) smoothly but here that’s not happening and I don't even try to max it out. Though I've tried to and its rather disguising when compared to The Witcher 3 but most games are sadly, even Rise of the Tomb Raider to bring that up which runs fine on max at the same resolution with blur and Depth of Field off",

            "review_text": "  I think I would really like this game but the 10 or so frames of mouse lag is a huge killer. It holds you back, forces you to play super safe since you cant reliably aim/track/shoot enemies on reaction, which basically removes a huge part of the game for me along with being the most frustrating mouse movement I have ever experienced since using a steelseries mouse back in 2012. This alone is a big red flag that pretty much nullifies 80% of the game. Sure, you can push on even with the input lag but it doesnt feel worth it. Wolfenstein: The New Order is capped at 60 fps and I had no problem doing 90 degree flickshots after getting used to it. DOOM isnt tied to a framerate limit which is great, but the input lag issues persist.  Enough about input lag, you get the idea. Before all the Doom 1/2 and Quake purists yell about how the game has been casualized or cinematic QTE-riddled you need to understand that the E3 footage they showed is pretty much nothing like the final product, at least from the first 3 hours I played.  The character movement is at a plesant speed, not too slow and not too fast to be overpowered. You can no longer shift-cirle-strafe-sprint around enemies at sanic speed, which I found to be borderline broken in the original game. Its funny how in the original game, it was actually harder to play with the invisible powerup as monsers would shoot in random directions instead of straight at you, and you had to dodge the projectiles based on reaction.  The new Doom doesnt do projectile prediction, usually enemies come from multiple directions, and move way faster. Since youre limited in terms of movement speed you usually have to resort to dodging multiple directions at once, without shift-sprint, against faster moving enemies. They found a nice mix between freedom and limitation. For those who are used to running through E1M1 in 16 seconds and outrun monsters by 10x speed, its going to feel 'casualized' but honestly shooting slow moving targets who cannot projectile predict while running at sanic speed is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing easy compared to newDoom's harder difficulty, if youre looking at it that way.  The game looks great even at the lowest settings with everything disabled. They should have toned down on the colour filter a bit but its just a minor design choice criticism. It stays somewhat true to the original game with no reloading, keycarded doors and armour pickups. There is a small narrative but its far from interesting and not essential. They shifted towards the original games focus more than Doom 3's 'horror action shooter' approach with jumpscares and dark corridors. I'll admit the levels in new Doom are a bit less complex than the old ones but its whatever to me, as long as it isnt a straight corridor.  Of course, all of this is overshadowed by the horrible mouse handling. It could have been a great action fps experience.",

            "review_text": "While it can be dangerous to enter a game with expectations, when it comes to new version of the classics, it is almost impossible not to do so.  With Doom (Doom 4) I was expecting a classic demon/monster slaughter game. A follow up to Doom 3. That however is not what I got from the latest instalment of the popular FPS franchise.  Gone are the dark and momentum building narrow corridors and sharp corners with demons lurking just around them, no more waiting for the attack announced by the sinister musical ambiance. Instead the game is much more bright and the music is more 'party on' then 'evil is coming'. The new Doom is designed to be more fast paced then it's predecessor, which at times was a bit to slow and the player could lose focus.  The game is follows a simple premise. Keep the player active while staying true to the Doom universe, and so it does. Note that I used the word active rather than entertained. The reason for that is as simple as the game itself. The game is not all that entertaining. True, for the first 3 mission you collect weapons and read through the 'mod' abilities as it is called, and you meet new daemons as well. But that soon passes, and since there is basically no story, you are left with only the actual gameplay.  The gameplay is typical of an FPS game. You have different weapons which do only slow you down while selected as well as 3 different kinds of equipment. The weapon selection is also staying true to the Doom universe. ranging from a pistol with unlimited energy, which means that no ammunition is required, to the much beloved combat shotgun which in this incarnation also host the explosive shot mod upgrade, turning it into a kind of grenade launcher. This is something different, as most FPS games traditionally attaches the grenade launcher to a rifle or otherwise machinegun. This mod is going to be very popular, as the claim could be made that the original Doom made the shotgun the popular and effective close-range weapon it is today. The combat shotgun has always had one weakness, and so it is in most FPS games, namely it's lack of long-range effectiveness. That has now been solved with the explosive shot upgrade. Thus turning it into the default selected weapon in your load-out. Every weapon has two mods, the combat shotguns other mod is charged burst which fires 3 rounds in a closer cluster then the normal firing mode. All weapons except for the pistol, which only has one upgrade tier, follows the same system. But while the heavy assault rifle and the gauss cannon have their advantages via their mods, such as the heavy assault rifle's micro missiles and the gauss cannon's siege mode, they never become the default weapons.  Doom tries to give the player customization options via the weapons mods and suit upgrades but also via the runes you can collect through rune trails. Rune trails are small challenges within the games missions. If you complete one, it will grant you a rune. At first you can only equip 1 rune but you will later be able to equip 3 at a time. These will give you various abilities, some of which are very useful and others which you the player will properly never use.  Now we come to the actual experience of the game. Whenever or not you like this game, will depend more on your personal preferences then it will on the games ability to provide you with entertainment. The game is overall dry and displays a lack of creative thinking. Each mission is the same. You follow the path of the map, searching for secrets along the way, killing daemons as you progress finally culminating in a large battle. Every mission is like that. However, each mission does not necessarily end with a boss fight.  The weapons and Praetor suit upgrades quickly become a stagnated element of the game, and the search for secrets is only interesting doing the first 3 missions. With the exception for the BFG9000 and assuming you have found the secrets, you will have all weapons available to you, after which it becomes more of a tedious task then a fun and necessary part of the game.  The whole time you move around you do not truly feel like you are actually playing as the character of the Doom Marine. it feels more like you are wearing ice-skates and the entire surface of Mars as well as damaged or destroyed parts of the various complexes and buildings are made from smooth ice, which you are just 'skating' over. Combined with the lack of atmosphere you never really feel the game and so remain the player rather than becoming the main antagonist, the Doom Marine. There is also the problem with the crosshair. Many FPS games can be made much more intense when played without the crosshair. In Doom however on the pistol has a zoom function, and that is to fire it's alternate firing mode. Without the ability to zoom, you need to crosshair. The heavy assault rifle and gauss cannon can be upgraded so that they do have zoom capability, but again this is in order to fire their alternate/mod ability. And here we have another problem. Many FPS games have different weapons not only as to offer the player interesting alternatives and variations, but also because different enemies are vulnerable to different weapons. In Doom however you can kill every enemy with any weapon with the exception of the pistol.  There is also the fact that id Software are simply trying too hard. Customizations are called mods, executions are called glory kills and alternative/secondary firing mode is given the name of the active mod. This seems more like an attempt to set the game apart from other FPS games rather than a meaningful or integral part of the gameplay.  Where Doom really falls through is not because of the repetitiveness, lack of ambiance or the quickly grow boring secrets. It comes from the unfulfilled potential. Characters like Olivia Pierce and Samual Hayden as well as the A.I. VEGA could have been developed so much more. Pierce you mostly hear over the public announcement system or via holographic projections. You only come face to face with her a few times, primarily in hell when she is sucked down into a pool of blood and one assumes, transformed into the final boss which looks like Krang from the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Samual Hayden guides you throughout the game over the intercom in your suit. The same goes for VEGA. While the emotional neutral but friendly artificial intelligence communicates with you at the beginning of the game, telling you about the capabilities of your suit and how it can help you upgrade those abilities, eventually VEGA becomes second to communication with Hayden. before going back to hell, the Doom Marine does backup VEGA before overloading his energy matrix, which causes a rift to hell to open. Doing the missions, you will actually be going to hell twice. The first time you will be sucked in and the second time will be when you overload VEGA un purpose. This feel like a way to alternative not just the scenery but also give the player a non-singular progression within the game. However, since the game is the same regardless of mission, environment and scenery this does not work. You are doing the same you did at the Argent Facility before being sucked in and at the facility which houses VEGA.  At the end of day, or night as the game was released at 01.00 (1AM) in Europe, what do I think of this new Doom? The answer is in their review above. But I will summarise.  Doom is a classic FPS game. The problem is, that this is 2016 and you need more than just big weapons and daemons to slaughter. The game has lost all of the darkness and atmosphere from its predecessor and the player is left with a repetitive gameplay which only at the beginning of the game offers entertainment and excitement. Most of the time you simply use whatever weapon you have favorited to kill whatever comes in front of you.",

            "review_text": "If you are looking for Bullet Storm meets Unreal Tornament, then by all means get this game. If you are looking for DOOM, go download the DOS Original.   It's not all bad though, the graphics are pretty and the sounds are very well done. This is to be expected with Bethesda games and full points and thumbs up to the graphics and audio teams. That's where it stops.   Controls DOOM guy slides around the stage like he is ice skating the whole while, which is decently smooth, but it handles like being locked on TURBO in old Doom. The absurd footstep sound effects that accompany his rediculous Dhalsim yoga strides are laughable.   Sound: So remember how I said they had great sound, well it is great... the first 40 times you hear it. If you'd like to experience, what i can only discribe as the 'cacophony of disgust', stay in a room with 2 or more zombies. Their overlapping, hideouse, rapid fire, cries of 'dear god shoot me so you don't have to listen to me', will make anyone want to mute all sounds. The music also is nice and has a nostalgic feel but it falls prey to the same blunders of only playing during the wave fighting and just ends into static ambiance as you enter a very dull stage till the next fight. I can understand that you need high impact sound tracts during the highest points of action and/or tension, but dont drop me like a the ball Bethesda was holding when they OK'ed this game to ship. I guess the scenes do fit the lifeless and dull atmosphere of mars when you are out of combat.   Combat:  I can't tell if they intentional wanted to take an epic crap all over DOOM or if they just thought wave combat made Doom 3 good.... I'm suprised one of the level designers didn't slap the developers upside the head with a 2x4 when they desided on wave battles. They lock you in tiny arenas in which you have to run around in circles like a constipated weener dog while firing idiotically at anything that happens to cross infront of you. I mean, if i wanted to play Quake Arena, I WOULD HAVE BOOTED UP QUAKE ARENA. I'll get to thier AI in a later section.  The regular level enemies, be they few and far between are a nice DOOM touch, it almost convinces me that this game was inspired by the original Dooms. I can see why they had to go with the atrocity that is wave combat. It's due to the awkward level design that just doesn't support original DOOM style play. They give the players grenades and a backpack full of weapons (i'll get to those later), to try and sell the 'You can play whatever style you like'. Its a lie, a straight up, bold face, 'it's 4 player co-op', LIE. The designers have forced players into the previously stated, running around like a constipated weener dog style. You can try and play it like an older Doom, Duke 3D, Blakestone, Wolfenstien or an other early era shooter, but no... you will die insanly fast due to the way that drops and AI is dispatched at you. Basically they have made it 'play our way! or face the consequences!'.  Weapons So you're hoping for that sweet sweet Plasma Rifle or a Chain Saw to dispatch some demonic justice? To bad, so sad, devs gave you the finger. Not in the, 'that's rudde' way, in the 'THAT'S NOT WHERE FINGERS GO!' way. Plasma Rifle, now #3, and worthless. It's basically like opening a bag of Skittles and throwing them in the face of a stampeding Rhino. If the bolts manage to hit, they do little to nothing at all. Chainsaw? Nope, runs on gas now so you will rarely be shreading some demon meat, to the melodious reving of a Gore Machine. The Shotgun? well that's about the only thing that can stagger a Knight... works even at long range. Odd, cause 20 rounds to the dome piece with other weapons and he doesn't even flinch. The Heavy Rifle is nice but is worthless till you can get some ammo upgrades. Really it would take to long to go into deatail about every gun and how they blow a walruses enourmous equipment, so I will just give you the good gun. The Pistol... that's it... the Pistol. Had to be one of the Halo fan boys watching too much Screw Attack and getting upset, but the pistol is the best gun in the game. Upgrade it and you can plow through enemies faster that a Backpack full of guns on the new DOOM... go figure.  Multiplayer Well if you heard the devs talking about how there was Co-op, might as well take your hopes and dreams of a fun time with your friends and bury them out back with gran-grans missing coarpse. That's right, they lied to us all. No story mode co-op, in fact, you wanna play co-op? then go build all your own stuff in this bull crap knock off of Doom Fever for 20 hours. The Devs just couldn't be bothered with making Doom, true to Doom. So take your sobbing and utter disgust for them elseware. But seriously, I like that I get a Doom game builder but COME ON, WHERE'S THE CO-OP CAMPAIGN?! Some one should be punched in the balls until they die for that one.  Seeing how this game has gone so far, I refuse to play this Deathmatch online.   Final So, the only reason I got this game after I swore off Bethesda (the new EA) was because I was nagged into getting it. I would have just pirated it and not felt utterly ripped off. On the EXTREAMLY off chance it was good I would have appologized and paid real money for it. But this attrocity, of a sham, of a garbage heap left in the summer sun for 3 weeks, force fed to people with pretty words and broken promises, should not stand. I would be completely fine with all this games innumerable faults if it just had the campaign co-op. I want to over look the terrible forced game play style, the atrocious sounds that should be patched, the bland levels and horrid wave combat arenas. I'd even ignore the fact that these dickless cads absolutly failed at capturing what Doom was, and instead gave us bobble heads of nostalgia and product placement. But I can't, and nor should anyone else.   There's only one way Bethesda can ever make it up, Seppuku. Take the blade, you know what to do... die with some form of honor.",

Not all of the issues can be fixed with patches but we'll get to that.  I've had nothing but bugs, glitches and crashes. I shouldn't of expected any different with Bethesda's name attached. The Beta was way more stable than this game is. I actually enjoyed the Beta.   I've had the world drop out, I've gotten embedded in rocks and walls, I've seen demons half in half out of the groumd, I've had a total of 11 crashes, one of which decided to corrupt my save file of 18 hours and then I had to redo the entire campaign again.   The campaign is definetly lengthy but a lot of it is kind of just padding, finding the key cards is fine but when it's overused, not to mention the gore nests that are basically just wave survival sections. In one level you have to do 4 nests in one area, that's over 40 minutes worth of gameplay right there, so there is definetely a load of that.  Gameplay itself, if you ignore all of the issues I've had, if you pretend they never existed or hopefully in the future, patched out. Then the gameplay itself is solid, it's a very decent shooter, it does it's job, unfortunately some of the level design I have issues with, constantly getting stuck on walls or small props, so that you then get scewed by demons.   You need to keep moving and shooting at the demons, but you can't shoot the demons if you are looking where you are going and you can't move if you are shooting the demons because you end up getting stuck on everything.  Despite the fact that you have a double jump mechanic and a climbing mechanic in this game there is an unusually amount of invisible walls and non climable surfaces that the game just decides on a whim what's climable and what's not.  The story is kind of lack lustre, the Doom games have always had a fairly decent story but it seems the devs decided to go the whole Dark Souls route and make it so the only story information you get is from reading small descriptions.  Oh and I hope you like sequel-bait endings that don't resolve anything. In typical id fashion, they've done this for their last few games, RAGE etc. People weren't too happy about that but I guess they didn't learn anything.  Just an FYI, I was running this with an i7 4790, 16GB RAM and on a GTX970 (also with the newest drivers). It seems that if anybody says anything even slightly negative about this game then they get told to go buy a console or that their PC is ♥♥♥♥.

            "review_text": "OK, so here goes:  TL:DR This is a 5.875/10 game at best.   I bought this game thinking it will be much like Doom 3; so full of in depth story that will make you question your very exitance...  I only gave the single player a go, and am yet to play multiplayer; though judging from the open Beta, it will feel like another Halo reskin, catering to the masses… I was expecting a Quake 3 / Doom 3 type of mutiplay; none of this loadouts/levelling BS. I don’t think the oldskoolers will be pleased.  The melee takedown of demons gets boring after the 3rd level of this game. I will give them credit though, the chainsaw takedown is boner inducing!  While the Demon Army vs you stays true to the original (think late 90’s) DOOM series, the secret/s exploration is rather counter-intuitive of the evolving “moving forward” combat feature... I spent 70% finding the secrets/upgrades of each level, and the rest blowing up Mars and its (former) inhabitants.  I will give ID/Bethesda some credit though; the weapon/suit upgrades were quite the nice touch (shotgun/assault rifle rockets anyone); only if you can locate the friggin bots that give you that option! Additionally, the berserk power ups are as satisfying as a Maccas (McDonalds) run during a drunken nigh out (punching Demons back to hell anyone?). The objective/s compass needs some re-work though.  The main story: sh*t, what main story? There’s as much depth to main story as there is to a drunken Californian chick dancing to Kesha’s “Take it Off” at a party, completely off her face on bath salts…  Overall, this game feels like a Serious Sam series, but with a DOOM twist. I recommend saving your money, purchasing a 6 pack and/or a few joints, acquiring Doom 3 and Resurrection of Evil and modding the sh*t out of them.  At least then you come across some “oh god I hope that was a fart” type of moments.  Peace, The Doc",

No doubt. I will check on the campaign later.  But the worse thing i'm criticizing and why i won't recommend this game to anyone (right now) is that Bethesda lied to the community and actually betrayed them.  Bethesda Softworks once stated that they won't use DRM software.  DOOM is protected with Denuvo Anti-Tamper v2. This piece of software is infamous.  Of course it's the right of the publisher to protect his game with such a software, but due to Denuvos form of forcing DRM the usage of this Anti-Tamper-software is a kick into the face of the PC community.  It's like publishers do not trust PC players anymore. Look at EA, Activision and now Bethesda themselves.  That's it for their behaviour.  The second thing is that they removed the bots and private matches from the game, which were existant in the Doom Beta. Also we can't host our own servers. The game is using officially hosted dedicated servers by Id Software and Bethesda. So again the PC community has been set a limit for their actions.  No offline multiplayer, no self hosted servers... just a shiny game. But that seems to be it. The campaign will play greatly i guess, but Bethesdas behaviour towards the PC community is just horrible and i already regret to have spent 50 bucks on the game...",

I'll start by saying I don't like very many first person shooters, but Doom is one of my favorite series. I had pretty low expectations for this game after seeing footage of the multiplayer beta (which I'll admit I didn't actually play), but I was pleasantly surprised that the singleplayer campaign at least, is the best game I've played this year so far. Doom 4 stays true to the source material, while still bringing it into 2016. This is how you revive a series.",

If they are under 21 they'll complain about lack of story, too fast etc.  If they are 21-29 ish they'll complain about how it isn't horror and Doom 3 was nothing like this etc.  If however your 30+ and remember playing Doom in early / mid 90s you'll love this, (unless your total classic doom purist)  I'm 30+ and I remember playing Doom back in 1994, you couldn't stop playing it always 'one more level'. Well I was playing 'one more level' last night and the night before.  This isn't Classic Doom, but it feels like what Classic Doom would be if made in 2016, all the good bits with the addition of things like the glory kills that spawn ammo and health, not to make it easy but keep the brutal pace of the murder at breakneck speeds. It's keeps things going.  It takes some things from Quake too like Quad Damage and double jumps (Quake 2 IIRC).  It takes away all the things I hate about Modern Single player FPS, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t story, waiting around for doors to be opened, everything is serious no humour, only 2 weapons, health regen etc etc etc.  Wolfenstein: TNO was a breath of fresh air and showed you do old school Single player FPS with a story (And given the setting of Wolfenstein vs Doom it makes this that would have more story)  Doom is like a hurricane of fresh air, it destroys everything in it's path it's truly amazing, it has story sure, but it's not important it's optional... killing is the main meat of the game, just like it was in 1994.  I hope we start to see some more single player FPS like Wolfenstein: TNO and Doom...... A Lovecraftian Quake 1 Single Player campaign WITH a decent multiplayer would be awesome.  It also runs like a dream, on my i5-3570k @ 4.7 ghz, 16gb Ram, 980ti it averages 120fps with dips rarely below 100 on Ultra + Nightmare Settings.  To top it all off Mick Gordon's soundtrack on this game is amazing, his work on Wolfenstein: TNO and Killer Instinct was great but this legendary, one of the best original soundtracks in a game I've ever played.   So do I recommend this... If you played Doom in mid 1990s yes 100%.   If you want a Doom 3 like experience... NO  If you want a new CoD.... try it you might like it.  Also play it on Ultra-Violence minimum, it isn't a complete walk in the park then, it's a challenge.",

            "review_text": "Now. Before I start the Review off: I have as of this moment NOT Completed the main Story.   &lt;This is a Spoiler Warning. Do not proceed if you do not wish to see the Main Plot Spoiled.&gt;   DOOM 2016 is here to bring back the classic fast-paced gameplay of Id's original DOOM released in 1993. but Just how well does this game hold up? From a Story perspective It involves you in the Story much more than the Original game did. To a point of having moments where the Pace of the game is broken by, Say. being locked in a room while you're spoken to. Although from a Gameplay perspective, Ignoring all moments of Pace-breaking Dialogue and In-game Cutscene (That is to say, a Cutscene where you are free to Move Doomguy around the map.) This game is VERY Fast-Paced, You can tell right off the bat that the Devs wanted to keep the player constantly on the move. and it Shows. taking a hit in this game is Punishment in it of itself, as much like the Original 1993 DOOM. Your only method of repairing health damage is to pick up a Medical Kit. although they have improved upon this with the Glory Kill system, which Plays a fancy little animation in which an enemy dies in a Spectacularly gorey way by your hands, Said enemy drops a Set amount of health (Dependant on what Percentage your own Health Bar is at.) Singleplayer has also handled Bosses quite well. (Well. the One boss I have faced.) As the Cyberdemon helps to both bring new things to the Table, while retaining it's old feel. For example, the CD keeps his missiles as his Main method of attack. but starting with his Second Phase, he begins slashing with his Blade Arm, making you constantly have to Move.   (Multiplayer.)  From a Multiplayer Perspective (Bear in mind, I have only played Ten matches of it to formulate this Opinion.) DOOM Brings back the Gameplay of Arena-Based Shooters, While incorperating the Custom Loadout functions of Modern FPS games like Halo, Call of Duty. Battlefield, you get the Idea. And much like these other games, You can also customise your Multiplayer Character to look 'Unique.'  Now to the gameplay. It's an Arena Based shooter, where sadly you cannot Pick-Up another Enemy's weapon upon their death. Which I find to be an interesting choice as Many other First-Person Shooters allow this function. Another thing of note is that you find Powerups. Be it Partial Invisibility or Quad Damage. You can also find two 'Power Weapons' on the Map. one of them is the Classic BFG-9000. while the other is the More recently-added Gauss Cannon. Both of them are Equally Devastating (With the BFG Being slightly moreso.) The last point of note is the 'Demon Rune.' in which If you pick it up. you are Transformed into one of four demons of your choosing. This I feel is a rather Irritating addition, as if an ally picks it up. Your team is Denied kills as this Ally Gets the Instant-Kill abilities of whichever Demon they have become. And if an Enemy gets it, Your team will be Respawning constantly. unable to kill this Unstoppable Demon. That's why they had added a Newer function. If the Demon Perishes prematurely. you can pick up the Rune, and become a Demon yourself. with the leftover Countdown of the Other Demon. this cycle continues until the Pickup dissapears, Or the match ends.   I unfortionantly cannot add my Two Cents for Snapmap, as I wish to wait until the game is several weeks old - So that Snapmap will have had time to recieve Well-made levels, and Possible updates.   Overall. My review. Singleplayer - Highly Enjoyable. Multiplayer - Needs work, but I do Enjoy it. Snapmap - N/A",

Doom 4 is a game that has absolutely no interest in realism. Health and ammo explode out of demons for no reason, Doomguy can double jump and always runs at full speed, and reloading is for ♥♥♥♥♥es. I love that there is no regenerating health in this game. The best way to get health is to weaken and then melee kill a demon. In other words the game is structured in a way that the best solution to your problems is never to hide behind a wall. Instead, the best way to improve your situation is to kill demons and never stop until the credits roll. It's easily the most Metal game I've played in a long time and if you want a different kind of shooter then I'd highly recommend it.",

Multiplayer: This mode is extremely fun, with competetive as well as cooperative gameplay with a variety of modes, and apparently modes within modes. It is extremely fun to play. However, the 'deathmatch' mode doesn't work for me. Whenever I select it the game doesn't load past the 'connecting' stage. It isn't that big of a deal, however, as all the other modes still work.  Campaign: This gamemode is possibly the center of the game. The good things about it are: The gameplay is extremely fun, fast-paced, and challenging. The secrets are hard to find but very rewarding when you do find them (and very fun to search for). The bosses are easy enough to be fun to fight, and hard enough to not be disappointed. Also, the storytelling is very good. There really is nothing that I have to complain about this.  Snapmap: I don't have any complaints for this mode. None. So, why don't I talk about the good things? For starters, this mode is extremely fun. This is basically a community-powered multiplayer mode, and is fun to see what other people come up with. Also, it is extremely fun to contribute to the snapmap community and be creative with your level designs.   Miscellaneous: The game crashes. A lot. I have had it crash four times during normal gameplay, and it crashes almost every time when trying to load up a mode of the game. (i.e. Campaign, multiplayer) So basically what you have to do is Load up the game in campaign mode, load it up in a different mode, restart your computer, load up the game in campaign mode again, and THEN load it up in the other mode. It is really quite time consuming and annoying. Also, I haven't been a victim of this yet, but I have heard many complaints about the dreaded 'Developer mode'. If this is as bad as it sounds, I would recommend fixing it. I think it should quite possibly being your first priority when addressing the issues with this game. Also, this didn't affect me that much, but after the second crash during gameplay when I loaded the game back up I got a notification saying that some of my data became corrupted and deleted. The things that got deleted were: My classic maps in the campaign and all of my multiplayer data. It would be disappointing had I not only been level 2 in multiplayer.   In short: This is a great game. Excellent storyline, great graphics, fast-paced, and extremely fun modes. Also, you get to absolutely massacre demons. I don't think I mentioned that yet.

Graphics and Sound are simply amazing, I was blown away by the quality of it. Very stable as well, didn't run into many bugs/glitches. Also, there is some replayability if you're into collectibles and secrets, as this game is filled with them (including hidden 'Classic Maps' that you can discover and play).

It attempts to tell a story, but I wonder if we're supposed to care about it. That's not saying the story was bad, it just didn't drive the game. Hunting for secrets and shooting everything that moved was more than enough.   Doom is brilliant with it's simplistic combat system. Doom is a callback to the shooting games of old. There is no spamming reload to keep a fresh magazine for 'when you need it.' You simply collect bullets for your favorite gun and shoot as long as you have ammo. The only exception is the super shotgun, which I suspect reloading is only for balancing the damage.  Somewhere along the way we've forgotten that our shooting games could be fun which makes Doom so much better. It's FUN, and that's the most important part about it. The game literally tells you almost every chance it gets through tips and hints: 'Don't stand still.' Most shooting games, encourage you to wait in the shadows for health to regen, or to pick off opponents from a distance with a sniper rifle. Not Doom. Doom kicks that school of thought square in the teeth and encourages the player to charge head-long into the fray, shotguns blazing, raining brass over the fallen corpses of your victims.

From playing the singleplayer campaign (for just a short time), it is clear that this 4th instalment maintains Doom's perfect action - horror mix (unlike a certain game who's name I wish not to remember, let alone mention). For a minor insight: about 10 minutes in, Doomguy ripped a possessed soldier's arm out, and smashed the soldier's head with it, right in front of my eyes. Simply epic. Now, the multiplayer, I don't really like that DOOM needs to restart in multiplayer mode in order to play the demon multiplayer, I find seeing my steam window mid gameplay rather depressing, like my game has suddenly crashed like they all used to on my craptop, although I guess I should get over this eventually. The gameplay itself is fast paced, much like that of the campaign, the weapons are fun and well balanced (although I find the chaingun slightly OP), and the demon summoning element is as exciting as it is challenging - all great fun!  A few minor flaws: - Always online DRM, I don't really see much of a problem with this, i play on my gaming PC, so I've always got a network connection, and it does kind of help against piracy, so I don't see this as a reason to dislike the game.  - Settings from singleplayer won't be applied to multiplayer (and vice versa), so if I configure my graphics settings in singleplayer, I have to do it again for multiplayer (and vice versa).  - And one small point: when a new colour is unlocked for either my armour or my weapons, it isn't unlocked for the other, which I was rather confused about to begin with, it would be nice to have my armour match my shiny weapons.   Overall, DOOM is amazing, and people are leaving bad reviews for nit-picking problems.",

Even though its a con as hole (Checkpoint saves only) It's a plus that there are so many.  Cons:  Checkpoint save only. It's Doom. You should be able to save where ever you like. Jump to Platform levels. Extremely annoying, and for me the jump boots were no help. At all Jump boots. Many secrets almost impossible to find.

And if you think its too easy, you can ramp it up to ultra nightmare, which is just glorious to behold.   If you liked doom, or like fps in general, you'll want to play this.  Edit: Just a small bit of a personal editorial to this.  There is nothing quiet so satisfying as being able to walk into any room of the game filled with varying demons, and think, 'I have a super shot gun; this is going to be fun'. No reloading, no 'stamina' just you, your gun, your health meter (which does helpfully beep at you when its low, but not annoyingly, just a gentle reminder you need to get up close and physical with a demon to execute it and get a little health back. If only Navi was this helpful.) and a personal arsenal in order to deal a wonderfully realized array of death to demons. Its just satisfying.   Also, Doom guy is a protagonist that plays the 'Strong, silent' type so perfectly well. All you know, is he is the angry marine with a shotgun and to stay out of his way while he does his job.",

The graphics and music are awesome. I just got a new GeForce GTX 1080 and in all the action and on Ultra, the frames never dropped below 60 FPS. I played with a gaming headset on which I think added to the fun.   All in all, if you played the old DOOM games back in the day like I did, you will love it. It is new but feels familiar.",

Single player,  In depth environments that have plenty of atmosphere and little hidden places for you to scavenge goodies and dolls (Fistbump). The attitude of Doom guy as you progress within the game is literally him giving zero ♥♥♥♥♥ about anything. You play as a badass, that’s it. The weapons and upgrades you get for them are pure awesome, the armor upgrades can assist you for much harder levels and difficulties, the Runes are decent adding more of a 'perk' thing within the game. More than plenty Demons to kill and it makes me wanting more, which leads to SnapMap features!  SnapMap, What’s better than killing hordes of demons by yourself? KILLING THEM WITH YOUR FRIENDS OF COURSE! The features of snapmap go way more in depth than I'm even able to explain. You could do almost anything with what it offers and from what I've played, I haven't even scratched the surface of the possibilities. Not even a few hours ago before this review I was playing with a friend and the game mode was literally playing Hide-and-Seek with 2 Hellknights and 1 baron. Craziest thing I've ever done in a game and it was perfect. Dark rooms, custom smoke clouds everywhere, and the only thing keeping you from getting caught was when you could hear the stomping of their feet and their gnarly ♥♥♥ growls as they got closer to you.  Multiplayer, I played Closed-beta and for the most part it was OK at best. Definitely had some balancing issues and to be honest it still does to an extent. Open beta was improved with running speed but that was the only thing I noticed. Finished game weapon balancing is noticeable and much appreciated because when I played the beta it was nothing but Vortex Rifles, Super shotty, and Rocket launchers. Now it feels a little bit more balanced but a few things here and there COULD be improved but I'm not complaining because I love playing with friends painting the place red.  In short, Do your own research and come to your own conclusion to whether or not you want the game. There have been more than enough trolls coming out of the woodwork to detest this game being worth anything JUST BECAUSE OF THE MULTIPLAYER BETA. Don't listen to hipster/nostalgia ♥♥♥♥ that do nothing but ♥♥♥♥♥ and moan about it not being nothing like Doom 1 and 2. I never played 1 or 2 and I don't care to. This game is fun, campaign is long, intense, and non-stop action. Having SnapMap brings replayability to a much larger scale and I appreciate everything ID have done for us.",

The unbelivable graphics and fast gameplay filled me with thrills and joy. I couldn't wait for it to release.   That being said, you could imagine my disappointment when I realised that my gaming rig, a 2 year old ASUS ROG g56jr with a measly GTX 760m barely met the minimum graphic card requirements for the game.  Never the less, I was persistent and still bought the game with great optimism. But on native 1080p resolution, the game was slower than a snail. With hours of tinkering and tweaking the settings, I could finally run the game with barely playable FPS of avg 30-35 and Drops as low as 13 on absolute minimum settings at 720p (on a 1080p screen btw).  Even at such dreaded framerates, I played the whole game, and absolutly loved it. The graphics, tho quiet pixelated, were still one of the best I have ever seen (ON MINIMUM I remind you) . The gameplay still action packed and fast paced. The joy of tearing the living sh*t out of demons is unparalled!  Now with the Vulkan API update, the game runs so much smoother and faster. My min FPS has never gone below 30, and averages at around 45, which is a HUGE improvement! This rekindled my excitement for the game, and now i've set out to finish the game again!   I have always loved the doom series, and I always will. This Doom in particular has earned a special place in my heart.  (No comment on Multiplayer)",

Let's shake it up a little.    Barry! Breakfast is ready!    Ooming!    Hang on a second.    Hello?    - Barry? - Adam?    - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up.    Looking sharp.    Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those.    Sorry. I'm excited.    Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son.    A perfect report card, all B's.    Very proud.    Ma! I got a thing going here.    - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me!    - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye!    Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!    - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry.    - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation.    Never thought I'd make it.    Three days grade school, three days high school.    Those were awkward.    Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive.    You did come back different.    - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.    - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah.    - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going.    Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.    Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead.    I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.    I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.    That's why we don't need vacations.    Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances.    - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are!    - Bee-men. - Amen!    Hallelujah!    Students, faculty, distinguished bees,    please welcome Dean Buzzwell.    Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of...    ...9:15.    That concludes our ceremonies.    And begins your career at Honex Industries!    Will we pick ourjob today?    I heard it's just orientation.    Heads up! Here we go.    Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.    - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary.    Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco    and a part of the Hexagon Group.    This is it!    Wow.    Wow.    We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life    to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.    Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.    Our top-secret formula    is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured    into this soothing sweet syrup    with its distinctive golden glow you know as...    Honey!    - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin!    - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins.    - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive    to improve every aspect of bee existence.    These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.    - What do you think he makes? - Not enough.    Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.    - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey    that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions.    Oan anyone work on the Krelman?    Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know    that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.    But choose carefully    because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.    The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.    What's the difference?    You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off    in 27 million years.    So you'll just work us to death?    We'll sure try.    Wow! That blew my mind!    'What's the difference?' How can you say that?    One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make.    I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.    But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?    Why would you question anything? We're bees.    We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.    You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?    Like what? Give me one example.    I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.    Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach.    Wait a second. Oheck it out.    - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow.    I've never seen them this close.    They know what it's like outside the hive.    Yeah, but some don't come back.    - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks!    You guys did great!    You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!    - I wonder where they were. - I don't know.    Their day's not planned.    Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.    You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.    Right.    Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.    It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it.    Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.    Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too?    Distant. Distant.    Look at these two.    - Oouple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them.    It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.    Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom!    He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me!    - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out.    What were you doing during this?    Trying to alert the authorities.    I can autograph that.    A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?    Yeah. Gusty.    We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.    - Six miles, huh? - Barry!    A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it.    - Maybe I am. - You are not!    We're going 0900 at J-Gate.    What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough?    I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.    Hey, Honex!    Dad, you surprised me.    You decide what you're interested in?    - Well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one.    Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?    Son, let me tell you about stirring.    You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.    You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing.    You know, Dad, the more I think about it,    maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.    You were thinking of what, making balloon animals?    That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.    Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!    - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny.    You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!    - You're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me!    Wait till you see the sticks I have.    I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!    Let's open some honey and celebrate!    Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae.    Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody 'dawg'!    I'm so proud.    - We're starting work today! - Today's the day.    Oome on! All the good jobs will be gone.    Yeah, right.    Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal...    - Is it still available? - Hang on. Two left!    One of them's yours! Oongratulations! Step to the side.    - What'd you get? - Picking crud out. Stellar!    Wow!    Oouple of newbies?    Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!    Make your choice.    - You want to go first? - No, you go.    Oh, my. What's available?    Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think.    - Any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you're on.    I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.    Wax monkey's always open.    The Krelman opened up again.    What happened?    A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one.    Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.    Dead from the neck up.

The addition of the chaingun made me particularly happy and has proven surprisingly effective at bringing down players with Demon runes. I don't feel the Demon rune is as OP as before. Armor customization is a fun feature, I enjoy seeing the hideously garish color schemes some people come up with. Same for the weapon customization.

There wasn't as much psychological strain when it came to overall creep factor though, you can see that the goal of this game was to not repeat DOOM 3. There wasn't a whole lot of fear-inducing moments, and majority of the demons had a very cartoon/caricature quality to them.

I only wish there was more absurdity/surrealism to the Hell environment, most of it felt like I was just on another planet.

Also after the opening it does tend to have characters talking story stuff without doomguy able to ignore them which kinda disappointed me after the strong statement that was made at the start. And im not convinced of their preferred anti aliasing option (fine most of the time, but in certain circumstances, near the Samual Hayden character or near VEGA's core, it can go from fuzzy all the way to a kind of blurry).

And i have huge expectation for this game.  The question for many is: Doom is back? Well, the question is wrong. This isn't Doom HD Remastered. This game has a lot of old Doom's in his veins but a lot of good stuffs were lost and a lot of new good things are in.   Just ask: Is this game good? Overall the new Doom is a very good game. Fast, adrenalinic, bloody, funny to play and difficult as well.  The gunplay rocks. It's the ol' good ID secret formula. You can hate Rage and Doom 3 but, just as all ID games, when you pull the trigger here comes the magic.  The bad things?  1 - The chainsaw. Is not a weapon anymore. It's more like a consumable item that instakill enemies and gift you a lot of ammo performing a kill. Stop. You can't use it as a normal weapon. You can't complete a level using only the CS. Sounds weird, isn't it? I take a couple of hours to get used to. The exploit works as intended (as an item that give you ammo without distract you from the action), but i miss the freedom of using only the chainsaw to clean a room.  2 - The pink demons. They are tankish mob instead of swarming foes. It's only matter of taste but i miss when i used to kill them with one, close range, shot of supershotgun (ofc you can 'easily' kill them from behind even now).    And what about discussed Glory Kills? I was really sceptical about them but i have to change my mind. Glory Kill system works and doesn't annoy me. The animations are fast and the flow of the action is not affected by them. Rather, i think the game gain some rhythm. Shoot, shoot, punch, loot. - Shoot, shoot, punch, loot. - and again and again.  Add to this rhythmic flow a stunning soundtrack and u got it. Let's Dance with demons and guns. :) Yes, soundtrack deserve a few more words. OST change from industrial metal in the Mars facility to gothic gregorian chant in hell. Both styles are very good and pump adrenalin your veins during epic fights. Turn off the music if you want to waste half of the fun.  In the end? Maybe it doesn't deserve 60-70€/$ (just as any other game out there, IMHO), but for the 25/30 price on key stores or in future sales you can take a solid, funny and well polished old style FPS.  Note: I'm probably at half or more of the single player campaign (after 10 hours). I don't even scratched multiplayer or Snapmap. Didn't read very good impressions about the first. In other hand, Snapmap sound promising (except for this 4 player limits).",

If that was the case the game either crashed instantly or the framerate started to drop drastically in the beginning. Despiting the fact that this game runs solid smooth on my rig (about 90 fps avg on Ultra settings), it's kind of annoying when this happens in the middle of a fight and you have to repeat all over again.  █ Design Aspects █ Secondly the game heavily feels like it has been optimized for console in the first place, even though its developers intended to make it the ultimate next-gen pc game.  Let's have a look on the weapon wheel. If you're about to switch weapons with the help of the weapon wheel, the in-game time slows down in order to suggest that your player is reacting in a lightning-fast way and - of course - to allow easy weapon selection on a controller. My questions here are, why does id Software implemented this feature for the pc version at all, and why do we - as the Masterrace Community - don't get the option to disable either the weapon wheel itself and/or the slow-motion effect?  Now to the hyped Glory Kill System. This is the reason where DOOM (4) got his fast-paced playstyle from, because every time you perform a Glory Kill on an enemy, he drops a ton of health and ammo packs. Looking for resources by roaming whole sectors on the map is in the past and not necessary anymore, except for armor (!there is already a rune to compensate for that!) and BFG ammunition. What I don't like about this is that you're invincible while you perform a Glory Kill. This, again, only seems to attribute to the console generation in order to make things easier for them.  █ Multiplayer █ Until now I haven't tested the MP, but the COD-like Loadout-System and the inability to change weapons during a fight - by picking up weapons dropped by dead enemy players - seems a bit fishy to me. This won't affect my rating for this game since I only focus on the campaign mode.  █ Conclusion █ After all this still doesn't affect my rating for DOOM (4), but you can tell that all negative aspects of this game are in fact referable to the obnoxious console generation.",

I've played a bit of the original doom games, but i have played and completed the original doom on IOS (dont laugh please) and have played a metric butt-load of brutal doom, which i still love very much.  i was very sceptical of the new doom title ever since the first trailer was released, and my skepticism increased even more when i played the... lukewarm multiplayer beta. Now that the game has released, i can safley say that those worries and doubts have been completley diminished by what is a stellar first person shooter, worthy of the doom title.  Doom builds on what has already been established by the past 20 years of doom games, paying homage to the series when necessary while adding new and exiting mechanics that seperate this game from the other titles in the series. one of the most noteworthy changes to combat is the new glory kill system, which allows players to stagger enemies, get close to them, and begin to rip and tear them to tiny pieces for health and ammunition. this new mechanic keeps you in the action, and lessens the need to run from combat to find armor shards and medkits. this offers a great risk-reward system of attemting to close the gap between you and a horde of monsters for health, or to fall back and avoid further damage.  the chainsaw was introduced in the first trailer caused alot of worry and controversity, and for good reason because it seemed to just be a simple 1-click kill weapon that played a long, boring cutscene of Doom guy ripping and tearing an enemy to bits. thankfully, the chainsaw has been very well implimented, and rewards its use with a shower of health and ammunition, at the cost of fuel for the chainsaw, which is very hard to find.  the level design is better than ever with giant, labrynthian levels with tons of nooks and crannies to explore and tons of different paths to take towards the destination. due the larger and more complex level design, with a greater emphasis on verticality, the map has been updated to include a 3d model of the map which is easy to read, so even players that have poor navigation skills can keep track of where they are.  another fantastic feature is the game's built-in map creator called Snapmap, which allows players to build any level they imagine with the tools the game gives you. you can upload and download any map you want, but keep in mind that a seperate account is required to upload and download maps. Co-op is avalible in snapmap, but not in the singleplayer campaign which is perfectly okay.  I havent played much of the multiplayer, but it is pretty good. dont expect the deepness or complexety found in the likes of CS:GO, Quake, or Reflex, instead expect a fun distraction from the main meat and potatoes of the game. (I may update this portion of the review as i put in more time in the multiplayer, which i intend to do.)  this game is fantastic, and is also a great chalange on the higher difficulties, demanding proper movement, accuracy and reflexes to combat the forces of hell. This game is a love letter to doom fans everywhere, and although some extreme doom zealots may be disgusted by the improvements made in this game, others will be blown away by one of the best FPS games in years, next to games like Wolfenstien the new order and Dying light. this game is a must buy from me.",

The graphics engine is intresting though. I got nvidia 660ti graphics card and I can play the game on ultra setting and still runs the game like it 1mb size data. single player is supremely good however the difficulty is not that hard to the point where it can be annoy but is not also easy. It has fine balance of difficulty especially on ultra nightmare mode, however I wouldn't recommend jump into ultra nightmare because you need high amount of experience because of permeadeath. practice on nightmare to get the feel how not to die, best rune and gun mods. the multiplayer aspect though is like old quake game which you stand still and camped. you be some one btch and you asking for it if you stand still to long. snapemap is fun but you need patient to create good custom map. now negative side. the game has bugged which can pop up, it relates to developer tool of which have to reinstal the game. also it can have ground probelms especially with elevator platforms like the core in argent tower but very rare you get it though. previously I had made negative comment about this game relating to the bug. the bug is still game breaking problem which relates to developer tool. once notice comes about the developer tool your game is lock out complete. bethesda and id software if you reading this FIX YOUR BLOODY GAME ESPECIALLY GOD DAMM GAME BREAKING ONE THAT IS ANNOYING TO HELL.Thank you for reading and also the people read my previous review about doom game. game the fúk on :3",

Gameplay takes me back quite a bit to the first release from the way the player moves to the enemies and story line. I enjoyed how some powerups are hidden and take some risk to find and get. The secrets are a nice throwback too (they're Doom plushies :D).  The weapons are pretty much what I'd expect out of Doom and I find them fun to use. I would suggest playing on the highest difficulty you can when you start as it makes the game more enjoyable, I think anyways.  Not many downsides to list aside from the use of the kill glory mechanic where you have to basically hit a key when enemies start to turn orange which shoots off a kill cinematic. They tend to get old real fast as there aren't that many cinematics (atleast per enemy) but you're somewhat forced to trigger the kill glory mechanic as it causes enemies to drop health and in some cases resources like ammo. I feel like if more cinematics were added to address this then the kill glory mechanic wouldn't get as stale as it did for as quick as it did.  The powerups are fun so far but they seem to be few and far between although it may be that I just haven't figured out a good way to unlock them yet.  The soundtrack is very much alike that of something from a Nine Inch Nails album which positively adds to the experience. Nothing like killing multiple enemies from hell while some NIN-type music is keeping up the pace with the mayhem. Parts of the game have an eerie vibe to it as well due to the music which gives it a nice atmosphere.  Pros: - Fast gameplay - Feels like the original Doom - Story is entertaining enough to warrant following - Music matches the gameplay and style of the game - Weapons are pretty fun to use, very Doom-like  Cons: - Kill glory cinematics tend to get old somewhat fast, especially given your reliance on them to get health and ammo  Overall, real positive throwback to the original Doom game.

As a veteran Doomer, I have to give id Software props for being able to make that call again. The gameplay here is a perfect match for the technology and tastes of the current era -- and that's exactly what the original got right during its time.  This new entry in the franchise preserves the classic arcade combat we've come to expect while adding a few layers of customization to both incentivize secret-hunting and keep demon encounters fresh. It's a reward system like that of the original, but buffed to meet the ambitions of the modern gamer. This is a recurring theme throughout the game; everything feels Doomish in that it's lean and kinetic, yet there is AAA-level substance as well. Not an easy balance to achieve as we've seen with hundreds of failed '90s-inspired titles. Respect.  The levels are expansive. The AI is ferocious and can go wherever you can. The weapons kick ♥♥♥. It's worth a buy for the campaign alone, but the multiplayer certainly isn't bad either. Add a decent in-game editor to the package and it's a great value for the money. Rejoice; Doom is back.",

There are a few crashes (I've experienced a few) and 2 hard crashes (which completely froze my one monitor and had to restart the computer to get it to work again, and the only game that did this to me is DOOM). Coming out of the box, the game is mostly well optimized (over 90% of the duration of the game I was significantly over &gt;60fps on max settings) which is good since most new games are plagued with performance issues.  The multiplayer isn't what I hoped for as I would have liked it to be more on par with the traditional quake or unreal tournament.

And the most important thing (the gameplay) is almost perfect, the loop of shooting, melee to get health and chainsaw to get ammo is incredibly rewarding and makes you feel like a demon-slaying badass. The downside to this is that some arenas are hard to distinguish but thanks to the varying art design i can distinguish between levels. Doom is back and its one of the best games i've played in quite some time.  Great Boss Battles, awesome weapons, awesome demons....

A fast-paced, straight-forwards shooter with a hellscape aesthetic: it stands as a shot in the arm for the first person and shooter genres that have stagnated in the last decade. While admittedly the art style is hardly fully faithful as its most iconic elements are merely borrowed for recognitions sake and it suffers much of the modern visual trend of all blending together (though it does have some nice color contrast in areas saving it from completely drowning in single colors), and the gameplay is more reminicent of Quake or Unreal than the original Doom, nonethless it is a highly worthwhile addition to anyone's library and one that I've not only returned to a few times already, but that I'll want to play years from now.  That said the multiplayer is as generic and modern as you can get. Absolutely no creativity was employed in putting together the exact same gameplay you could get in Halo, Battlefield or Call of Duty. It should come as no surprise then it was made by the people who put together CoD's multiplayer modes. To be fair, if you like that then here you go, more of the same. However, it departs so heartily from the single-player experience it really makes you question why bother at all? Why play it so straight in the single-player and then revert back to the status quo for online play? I'm guessing despite Bethesda banking on the multiplayer (the season pass is all multiplayer content), we'll see a nice single-player map pack, or dare I dream, full episode expansions in the future so hopefully everyone wins in the end.",

            "review_text": "  I would first like to point out that the always-online DRM was a bug for Vulkan API, and it's since been fixed. Online DRM never existed if you didn't use Vulkan, and it's since been patched out, because it was a bug. Don't listen to the people whining about it because it was a temporary mistake, and it's not there anymore.  TL;DR It's great. The singleplayer is the best shooter I've played in years and years, the multiplayer is meh, and the snapmap has some pretty awesome stuff.  Normally, in a modern shooter, the best tactics involving long bouts of not doing much of anything.  A huge mob of baddies in front of you? Just shoot and back-pedal. That's what you do in, for instance, Left 4 Dead. Low on health? Just take yourself out of the fight, hide behind some cover and wait for the jam to clear off your face and you're right as rain. This part is too tough for you to do normally? Just sit back, snipe at them, and go in when their number is thinned down.  Doom involves pretty much none of that. Sure, you can do the back-pedal and shoot, and it is possible in a couple of places to snipe enemies before engaging. But even in those instances, they're not good tactics. Instead, you'll be constantly rushing into combat because that's the best tactic. Not least because the enemies, though weaker than you, are about as mobile - imps will jump around all over the fantastically designed 3D arenas, Hell Knights will rush into you way faster than you could run away, and even the nearly-stationary Mancubuses can leap between ledges and shoot at you from far away.  The weapons, in stark contrast to most shooters and more akin to Quake or Unreal Tournament, all behave quite differently instead of being just minute stat differences. They all promote more thinking with your environment, and there is progression in the game that allows you to unlock new special abilities for the weapons.  One thing that this game does incredibly well is that whenever you get hit, it's your fault. Everything, and I mean everything, can be dodged or avoided. The design philosophy seemed to be that you should be able to avoid ever getting hit if you're good enough, and it works extremely well. Almost all of the shooting by the enemies is done with non-instant projectiles, and the few that are hitscan give plenty of warning before being used (such as a 'bullet hell'-type laser that shows itself before doing damage).  The way to get health and armor is by finding it in the world. Alternatively, you can weaken enemies until they become staggered, at which point you can initiate a gory and satisfying Glory Kill, immediately killing them and causing them to drop health. This is a fantastic example of give-and-take, because even though that both saves ammo and gives health, it could put you in more danger and makes you think quickly about the environment.  Outside of the unbelievably amazing singleplayer, the game offers a multiplayer and what they call snapmap. The multiplayer is extremely mediocre, and it certainly can serve a couple hours of fun. It's not really that great with friends, and ultimately it feels less like multiplayer and more like random, disjointed running around hoping you find another player that you are allowed to kill.  Snapmap is a great place to find things to do. There are all kinds of different things to find, from trivia quizzes to arenas to entire maps devoted to providing the same kind of experience as the singleplayer. If you played through some of the community content for Warcraft 3 or Starcraft 2, you know exactly the kinds of things you'll be able to find. You can also make your own, and it's pretty simple to learn and still fairly powerful, though there are definitely a few shortcomings.  Ultimately, this game is a purchase I'll never regret. The fighting in it was an absolute breath of fresh air from the stale Battlefield and CoD series, which basically got one super succesful game and never deviated from their formulas.",

            "review_text": "Okay, I've played almost 30 hours of this game and I'm ready to review it. The grand ♥♥♥♥ing daddy of all first person shooters, DOOM.  I was a huge fan of the original when it came out. I was about 7 years old, and I can't believe my parents allowed me to play this. I think they knew how cool it was and didn't care, when usually they were pretty struct about this kind of stuff. Anyway, I knew a super brain down the street that taught us how to hook it up to our dial up internet and we were 'deathmatching'.  I played the ever loving ♥♥♥♥ out of that game. It largely shaped my taste in art even today, and I consider it a fine work of art.  This game, after all these years, lives up to the hype. Doom 3 came out right when I went to college and I tried many times to get into it. It never really caught my attention after a few hours and I've still to this day never beaten it.  I remember seeing DOOM II on the shelf at 'SUN Electionics' in the east but never buying it.  So basically it's been 20 years or more since there's been a true DOOM follow up, and this game is exactly that. In a way, I like this game the most in the entire series. It's a no-nonsense balls to the wall splatterhouse of fun that is like a constant adrenaline rush you've likely not experienced in a game possibly ever.  Some of the musical tracks, when they kick on during a fight just inspire a sense of gamer trance that cannot be compared. This game looks beautiful and runs like a dream even though I've had some drops in frames. I hope future patches remedy this.  I thoroughly enjoy the multiplayer and learned it was made by old Bungie devs. It's like Halo mixed with Quake 3. I went back and played Q3 some after the beta, and this to me is like the Halo devs trying to replicate Quake 3. It's awesome.  There have been some very interesting Snapmaps, but not enough people playing them. There is literally almost no one playing any of them in matchmaking right after release, which really sucks.   All in all, this is a ♥♥♥♥ing awesome brutal amazing video game you need to own and play multiple times.",

Doom 3 was an ok game, which had me skeptical to how good this new release was going to be. I picked it up during the half price sale, and boy am I glad I did! They totally knock it out of the park in the single player campaigns.  The throwbacks to the originals are fun and shows a stark juxtapose in just how far we have came in gaming graphics.   The double jump, weapon mods, and glory kills are fun added mechanics that I was not sure I would like when first introduced during game play. It did not take me very long to love them!  There's a good balance of action, exploration, humor and wit in this FPS. Thanks ID and Bethesda for making a great title!  I love the Fallout 4 cameos too.

            "review_text": "All in all a brilliant return to the classic FPS, with all the benefits of new technologies added.  SP: The campaign is long and keeps you on the tip of your seat for the entire time. There are plenty of difficulty settings, the hardest of which will have you die a lot. The demons feel very powerful, especially when you encounter new ones and don't know what to do against them yet. The demons in the boss fights are very different from each other and will probably kill you a few times before you know how to counter all their attacks. The movement and gameplay is superb. This is a 100% classic id game with full movement control, but now with some nice mobility additions that make it even more fun. The glory kill system is also surprisingly fun and provides you with a way to gain some health back when needed.  I'd rate the SP a solid 10/10. It's a must play for every FPS fan.  MP: The gameplay in MP is fun and has some interesting new additions, like the possibility to play as a demon, but wanders quite far from original id shooters in concept. There are no weapon pickups (except for the BFG), so you choose 2 weapons to start with and will be stuck with those until you die. This takes away some of the important gameplay aspects from the classic shooters, like map control and quick switching to more appropriate weapons when needed. The lack of classic modes as FFA, instagib, CTF,... is also inexcusable. We can only hope they decide to add them in the near future. The unlock system is more fun than I thought it would be. The weapons unlock fast and you're not at a disadvantage with the stock weapons. You can spend some time modifying your character if you're into that stuff. In short, the MP leaves something to be desired, but is not that bad either, I'd rate it 7/10.  Snapmap: It's a good concept, but not at all a replacement for real map making and modding tools. It's clear that the console market has had an impact in the dumbing down of this game. I really hope some proper modding tools get released.",

You could only get it as shareware back then so I didn't know anyone else with a copy. Me and my friend pretty much played it to death over and over again. We'd take it in turns, swapping over when we'd finished a level or lost a life.  Doom 2016 has the spirit of that game. The story seems to be the same and the action follows the same pattern, even down to the colour coded keys.  Basically, it's lots of shooting with periods of recovery where you can hunt down ammo and health that you've missed, just like the original.  There's plenty of modern stuff, like weapon upgrades etc... which add depth, and bits of story to piece together. However, the core of the game is still lots of fast paced shooting.  The game runs at 100+ fps on my GTX970 (@1080) with most of the setting tricked out, and it looks great.",

            "review_text": "So, straight out of the gate I'll just say the game is a solid 80/100.  I played it for roughly 45 minutes, and spent another 45 minutes burried in menus, console commands, diagonstics, driver installs, forum posts, and Bethesda's technical support. After about 90 minutes I reluctantly gave up and requested a refund.  I'm not kidding.  Grade: B 4 out of 5 stars. Certified fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. Pick whatever metric you like.  Here's the thing:  I had massive technical difficulties that made the game practically unplayable. There was a consistent and cronic stutter that hitched and skipped both audio and framerate. I mean look at this sentence...   'I ho ou know wh ou're g et t ing y oursel f int o.'  That, right there, was CONSTANT. Not only that, but duuring fire fights these lapses in time would translate to falling of ledges or cliffs and plenty of lost targets and unintentional deaths. Between those gaps? 60-70 fps. Completely inexplicable. It's not like I have old hardware either... I run an i7 4770 @ 3.5GHz, 16GBs or RAM, a GTX 960 4GB, and a 2TB SSHDD with 6GBs of transfer, along with the most recent drivers available. Fallout runs a respectable 40 fps in Ultra quality. *shrug*  So, why 8/10?  Two reasons. First, the game itself - while unplayable for me - still looks fun as hell (pun initially not intended but now that I think about it, I'm totally intending it) and I can imagine how awesome it would be whipping around the well-crafted levels that circulate action around like a waterpark ride at break-neck speeds feeling like an absolute badass as I splash-damage and glory-kill my way through demonic hordes. The promise is there, but either my system or the software is unwilling. It looks like the best kind of throwback carnage I used to relish in my early gaming days, and given the so many other broken promises of other reboots and homages claiming to recapture that nostalgia, it's a feat in itself that DOOM appears to succeed at this.  Second, It is totally self-aware of it's absurdity. Doomguy is an ill-adjusted individual in a world of ill-adjusted gospel. Hell is the joke in Doom in very much the same way corruption is the joke in politics, capitolized upon in - I assume - almost every way possible. Hell is 'worth it.'  Now, here's the downside: where Doom succeeds, it simultaneously falls flat. If you ever played the original Doom or Doom II during their heyday, this will be an easier concept to grasp. If you only played Doom or Doom II within the last 10 years for the novelty or simply to experience gaming's roots, then you'll likely miss what I'm getting on about.  Doom in it's heyday was REVOLUTIONARY. No one had seen anything like it, and it was this sense of awe along side the addictive gameplay that made Doom the phenomenon it is known for. Capturing that sense of awe - of something truly new and exciting - is impossible, and in that respect it will never outshine the original - certainly if you covet those fond memories playing for the first time nearly two-and-a-half decades ago. As nice as it looks, it just doesn't recapture that magic.  Assuming there will be a patch that rectifies the performance issues, I will happily pick this puppy up again and charge headlong through those firey gates of blissful carnage. Until then, I'll be living out my demon-slaying fantasies vicariously through twitch streams and youtube speed runs, pining away until the day my machine decides it's ready to play.  Eight out of ten, would suffer through tech support again.",

In so many ways, it's even better than shooters of the past and feels more like a 'survival shooter' than even classic DOOM. Here are the positives (+) and negatives (-) of DOOM:  + Incredible and fast paced action. Immediately, the game doesn't waste time and throws you right into the fray!  + Tons of secret areas and hidden goodies encourage exploration. This was sorely needed in today's shooter market... and I mean something that isn't open world!  + Level design is TOP NOTCH. An excellent combonation of linear paths connecting to big atriums and even open ended areas. The level design is directly built into the action and encourages a variety of ways to move in combat.  + No regenerating health! Armor and health pickups! Ammo of varying types! Powerups!  + Absolutely EXCELLENT survival and resource management elements during combat! Ammo runs out relatively fast for every gun, encouraging weapon switching, using the chainsaw, and glory kills. Health and armor are drained relatively fast too, encouraging more than just the things I mentioned, such as running around looking for pickups.  + Vulkan Mode ensures massive amounts of scalability even for older gaming hardware!  +/- Upgrades and runes reward players for their efforts and exploring. However, some upgrades feel useless and are far too situational.  +/- Surprisingly good main character who is by far the most expressive silent protagonist so far!  +/- Extensive amount of lore. If you are willing to dig through all the subtle clues, hints, and lore items, you'll find a decent story behind the mayhem.  +/- SnapMap is AWESOME, but feels limited and lacking in a few areas. It's a damn solid treat to return to, especially for community events and free updates.  - Multiplayer is fun and makes this a complete value package, but it's quite frankly just a solid experience. It's not good enough for oldschool shooter multiplayer fans. Weapon balance is still completely off, hack modules still provide too much of an advantage, and armor still acts as a second health bar.  - A tiny amount of bugs and issues that don't hamper the experience too much.",

It does not have the tension and fear of Doom 3, it is all action, fast and furious with great graphics and a great soundtrack. As FPS go, this is about is purely entertaining as it gets. There is no reason to hide behind things, you must keep moving, jumping, picking things up, all while selecting weapons and blasting everything that moves in to messy bloody chunks. If you want a little bit more depth, there are things to find, both optionally as secrets (models, and more useful 'rune challenges' which give selectable upgrades) and because you have to find keycards. It's much less stress than Doom 3, because you don't wait in fear of being attacked, you are almost always being attacked, there is no time to think, just shoot. If you liked the orginal doom, you will love this. If you never played the original doom, you will probably still love this. If you kind of liked doom 3 but didn't like that feeling of things jumping out at you (like alien isolation), this is nothing like it. Even on the hardest out of the box setting of ultra violence, there is still plenty of ammo to keep blasting. You never die because of a reload either, if you run out of ammo it swaps weapon for you and you just keep shooting.  Perfect FPS, the only problem is it crashes every now and then. There are frequent checkpoints though so if it does crash you don't lose any progress. If you enjoy shooting things without any tactical thought other than using ledges and platforms, this is for you. It's easy to learn how to play it in less than 5 minutes, and then it just gets better and better the more you play.  There is a bit of replayability if you want to get all the collectibles, and anyway, once you finish it you get harder modes unlocked. I didn't try the MP yet, but I have plenty of MP games nd it is nice to have an old school single player game to just blow stuff to bits, and a choice of two shotguns :) It's very fun and very gory. Oh, and the chainsaw is awesome. UPDATE: Now I have finished the game, I will add there is replayability in this game and it carries on being fun. When you are not rushing through and have time to find all the secrets, there are loads of nice little touches and attention to detail. For example, I am getting the collectable models, which involve collecting little mini marines. When you find the doom marine collectable... well I won't spoil it, but let's just say he does something different to all the others :) The challenges on each level are all varied and different, the secrets, some of them take a lot of exploring around, and the weapon challenges are the most fun of all. One of them involves killing 5 hell knights with a headshot, another is killing 5 summoners with locked on missles (they teleport away when you try this). There are dozens of challenges between the weapons, level challenges, and secrets. The game is not overly hard even on ultra violence, apart from the boss levels (espeically Oliva, really hard). Normal demons are easy enough once you have the weapons, but it's good to know there are extra difficulties for when I have unlocked everything to give me another go at it with more challenge. Superb game, and best of all there are hidden maps from the orignal doom as easter eggs. It's the best Doom ever made, and feels like playing the original, but everything bigger and better. Great job ID software! Uodate 2: for all those who say the game is hard to beat, I did this on ultra violence on my first play through, but if you are struggling... now i have all the upgrades and rune challenges, here is a way to make it VERY EASY! Get the Mobile Turrent upgrade for chaingun, AND mastery so it never overheats, along with the Rich get Richer Rune challenge, and upgrade that. You can then spam everything with the chain gun and never run out of ammo. It is so overpowered it feels like a hack, but it's still fun :)",

If you want a fast paced, violent shooter with music that gets your blood pumping, Doom 4 won't disappoint you. Even if you're one of those poor souls that hasn't played Doom, you'll still enjoy Doom 4. For the rest of us normal people that have played Doom, this game is even more of a treat. The BFG 9000 works just like it did in 1993. The Super Shotgun makes a return, and is the only weapon that needs to be reloaded, unless you count the need to operate the pump on the combat shotgun. There are secret areas on every mission, and all of the demons are recognizeable as 3D versions of their classic counterparts. The graphics are impressive, despite the fact that my computer can't handle much higher than medium settings. The sound design is perfect, and feels right at home in a Doom game. If you enjoyed Doom 1 and/or Doom 2, you owe it to yourself to buy Doom 4. ID returned to their roots with this game, and it shows.",

Gameplay itself feels fluid and rewarding and boss battles aren't too hard but still offer a nice challenge, (spoilers ahead) I was kinda disappointed in the last boss being too easy, and even the last few battles were way harder than the boss itself. I am not sure if this game is worth 60€ considering that it took me only 13 hours to finish it, but there many collectibles and if you are interested in finding those it will certainly take some time since i did only find 1 or 2. I wasnt really interested in the multiplayer it seemed a bit unbalanced in my opinion. Game is pretty well optimized running on almost max settings at constant smooth 60fps with gtx980 and i7-6700k, i did notice quite bit of stuttering when using Vulkan api altrough my fps counter was showing constant 60fps.  Pros: -Excellent level design -Challenging gameplay -Great graphics -Well optimized -Enemies are well designed and fit in the game same as weapons -Good storyline -Fluid gameplay with glory kills -DOOMGUY  cons: -Little bit short -Last boss felt too easy -Stuttering with Vulkan api -Repetitive first hours  I would give this 8/10",

DOOM 4 dose not disappoint, the fast paced combat is intense and insane, I see some infulkecne from brutal doom,  the creature design and creature graphics are gorgeous, some really detailed 3D models here to gawk at. Looking for Secrets is fun and rewarding; some of them are annoyingly well hidden. The classic levels are a lot of fun and quite challenging because there are no checkpoints. The bosses are great Would of been nice to have a couple more bosses at the end of some of the earlier levels.  The soundtrack is beast in some tracks and maybe a tad weak in others,  Probably just my opinion, It sounds a little too robotic and modern but I just really love the classic doom music and sound.  Story is average but is very scarce throughout the game so it's not that annoying. Who decided to have optimus prime's voice in this game? Multiplayer is average and matchmaking seems a little broken, why no server browser? and Snap Map is a big disappointment so far, joining a snap map match is near impossible.  All in all The wait was well worth it. It's hard to put a number on the experience... I think it misses the 9 mark slightly, with a couple more bosses and maybe a little more variety in the level design and scenery to go along with the facilities/hell it would of been perfect.   8.5/10 ",

I like the story aspect explaining why our soldier is such a bad ♥♥♥.

Same old marine, total mute. Never as much as a 'yes' or 'UMPH!'. I have played through the SP probably about 5 times by now. Haven't gotten far on Ultra Nightmare.  As stated, the MP is a waste of time. They were too focused on making it fast instead of fun and balanced. The result is a jumping, spam fest. Weee.   Level builder is also a waste of time. No good levels to play. Making levels in cumbersome, time consuming, and unsatisfactory.   So for around $40 USD, it would be worth it. Much more than that, and i would be getting a little sour.",

The main reason for this is the fact that the story line is completely optional to follow along with. The Doom Slayer/Hell Walker certainly doesn't care, as shown for his disregard for the other characters, so why should you? However, if you're one of those give-me-a-game-with-lore-and-plot-lines types of people, you can always find the collectibles and read the logs to follow along.  The weapons in this game are fantastic. Every weapon feels delicately balanced, leaving you to make your own preferences; whether you switch weapon for different encounter circumstances, or whether you, like I, choose a weapon that you like and stick by it (I got twice as many kills with the shotgun as my second most used weapon).  The downside to this game is the replayability aspect. I can certainly see this sort of game appealing to those who like to speedrun, as combat is very fast and you have harder difficulties that are unlocked through playing the game. However, I have 100% completed the game on a single save file (all collectibles, upgrades, and logs) due to the fact that you can replay missions with all of your previously unlocked weapons and upgrades, and it only took just over 30 hours. The only reason I would have to come back to this game is if I were to get a monster of a computer and play it at max settings 1440p/4k.",

I also miss 'you pick up the key/powerup, and the room suddenly turns into a deathtrap' thing.

The multiplayer aspect -- be it snapmaps or the actual deathmatches -- is obviously a staple part in this game and for people looking for that type of play this game is a must have. I would highly recommend it still for those wanting a great single player campaign. I never had one moment where the single player campaign was not fun, and the collectibles within the game made it necesarry to replay levels, but it was never dry repetitive gameplay. To conclude, if you are wanting a great single player campaign while looking for a new fps for online play, or a map creator with the snapmaps Doom is for you, and it's worth picking up at full cost. If you're not so focused on the multiplayer fps, or the map creation aspect then the game is still one worth playing, however with a complete run through at 34.7hrs it would be hard to justify spending the whole 60 USD on the game. Still a fun experience that if possible everyone should get the chance to at least experience.",

Even on a mid-tier laptop from 2014, it runs at a solid 45 fps, so optimization is not a problem. The story is rich for those who go looking for it, but is in no way mandatory. You are Doomguy. You rip. You tear. You turn demons into goopy red pudding.   The only bad things I have to say are the vertical platforming sections can be a bit hit-or-miss, and if you're not fully engaged, the combat can seem samey and tedious.

            "review_text": "I'll be honest. I was scared for Doom at first. I had a formulaic and hilariously terrible gameplay experience in the closed and open multiplayer betas, and I continued to have that same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ time in the multiplayer after release. You've heard the story about how that component was farmed out to the dipsticks that make the halo multiplayer, and it shows: it's halo with doom-flavored window dressing. But the moment the game launched, I heard nothing but good things about the campaign. I watched the Game Grumps play it, tried the demo, and got the game for myself in the recent Steam summer sale.  The glowing reviews don't even do this game justice. Doom 4 is the perfect unholy marriage of everything that was once good in 90s FPS with what little is nice about modern ones, and its success is both a testament to the quality of that subgenre and a slap in the face to the military shooter I hope it will feel for some years to come. Channeling the first two Dooms with a vengeance, Doom 4 hurls you headlong into the action immediately, with brisk movement speed, no cover, no regenerating health, double jumping (eventually), no reloading, armor pickups, secret areas, powerups, the ability to carry every weapon at once and, if you're a stickler about that kind of thing, no cutscenes. It blends these with the amazing visuals you'd expect from ID's in-house engines and the modern mercy of the objective waypoint, sparing me from those long, agonizing hours of my youth spent blundering about Doom 2's infuriating mazes. New to the series also are alternate fire modes for your weapons, which replace the bland and boring iron-sight gameplay of modern FPS with Unreal Tournament-style combat options, with upgrades for these alt fire modes and 'demon rune' perks that both are earned by and help you do more of the Doomy things you'd already be doing- shooting, rip and/or tearing, and finding secrets. I have heard absolute Doom purists complain about these upgrades, but I find them an enriching addition.  On that note, I must speak to the signature mechanic of the game: the glory kills. It was originally feared that these too fundamentally altered and broke up the signature gameplay of Doom, but I view it from a different angle. They are the icing on a new kind of murder cake that this game has created, and I hope other games will follow its example. This Doom is not just a sequel to Doom 1 and 2, spiritually if not directly. It is the culmination and acknowledgement of the memetic evolution of Doom and its nameless protagonist, including the infamous Brutal Doom mod. The achievements reference everything from classic cheat codes to the doom comic to the 'shoot it until it dies' protip, and the phrase 'rip and tear' is even used in-game. This is the story of Doomguy as the legend he has become, a berserker-packing man-and-a-half who can literally rip demons in twain with his bare hands and just happens to like power armor, guns and chainsaws because they make his job easier. There is just enough plot and lore entries to reinforce this idea, telling a story of a lone champion's eternal vengeance.  The fact that glory kills reward you with health does indeed make the game easier, but that's because the game would be a lot harder if you didn't get health that way. You need to move fast because the demons are numerous and aggressive, and you need to carry all the guns because you actually need that much firepower to tackle everything hell throws your way. You need that armor to survive a few seconds longer, you need those upgrades and runes to give you an edge to offset the demons' numerical advantage... it all creates this gameplay loop that works incredibly smoothly. I enjoyed every moment of the campaign from beginning to end: the fights, the jumps, the secrets, and the plot, which through limited character interaction is very effective at what it does. I only hope that there are campaign add-ons in the future.  With the multiplayer as disappointing as it is, with it's stupidly low time-to-kill ratio and various trappings of the CoD/Nexon/Overwatch genre of shooter, such as instant kills, weird hitboxes and total lack of rocket jumping, I thought my experience with Doom ended when the credits rolled after the campaign. The true surprise then, was the Snapmap mode: A built-in editor that allows you to create your own maps for deathmatches as well as solo or cooperative play, using pre-made room segments to create your own maps, and items, weapons, enemies, AI directors, environmental triggers and other bits that allow you to develop your own gameplay within the confines of the game's assets. It's no true set of mod tools and obviously pales in comparison to what is possible and has been done with classic Doom and Quake, but there is some surprising depth in Snapmap and is worth a look. Importantly, it means there is a form of coop in a game that would otherwise have none, which is a shame, really.  ID is mounting an ongoing effort to improve the multiplayer with additional modes and such, but regardless, this game is about the campaign, and it's really damn good.  See you in hell!",

            "review_text": "I am pleasantly surprised.  After playing the open multiplayer beta, I was 99.9% sure that this game would become a huge fail in light of Overwatch's sounding success. However, ID obviously took the harsh criticism of the beta to heart and polished the game before launch. Its fast and fun. Also pretty, even at ~60FPS on my old 660Ti.  Things I really like is how I got lost several times on Mars. Yes, that is a *good* thing in our era of linear railshooters. DOOM does not take your hand along for the ride. There is a single opaque marker that points you into the general direction, but how you get there is up to you. The game leads you onto the correct path by subtle and immersive helpers like green flashlights instead of waypoints or an all-powerful minimap.  The combat is super-fluid and rewards experimentation with the environment or the enemies. For example, when the shield-bearing guys have to climb to reach you, they drop the shield while climbing, making them a much easier kill.  You could probably write the entire story of this game on a paper coaster, but that is actually a plus. The original Dooms had a few screens of text to tell you what's going on and did the rest by show, not tell. Doom 3 tried it with cutscenes and characters -- and failed, hard. DOOM gives you a snippet here, a short monolog there, that's it. And that's good! I didn't buy DOOM to listen to a sci-fi version of Lord of the Rings. I bought DOOM to kick some demon ♥♥♥ to hell and back. As a die-hard roleplayer I can say that I still feel very immersed into the game, thanks to the detailed environment and the epic sound and music.  Speaking of immersion, there is precious little of the cheap jump-scare horror of Doom 3 left. Also a plus for me. I never linked that kind of horror to the original Dooms and found it very misplaced in Doom 3. DOOM shows a lot of gore and satanic stuff to build atmosphere, but you won't find any demons jumping out of the furniture.  The most unimmersive thing I came across are runes, which open arcade challenges to earn small upgrades. They rip you out of the game world into a separate instance to shoot barrels and alike before the timer runs out. At first, I was sure the game was pulling my leg, but its actually real. Whoever came up with that idea should be sent to hell himself. Luckily they are optional, so I'll ignore them for the most part.   Having said that, Tracer is still faster than Doomguy and can easily run at 120 FPS on old hardware. I also don't think that DOOM will prevail in the long run against Overwatch, cuz if the majority of players were into lightning-fast action with their higher brain functions turned off, Quake Live would have received much more attention in recent years.  Overwatch is more versatile and more fun overall than rocketjumping arround the same few maps, using the same tactics and the same weapons every day. That also goes for DOOM's singleplayer campaign. The scenery tends to become bland and repetetive very fast.  Either way, if you're into the old DOOM (not Doom 3), get it.   Update: My experiences soured a bit when the singleplayer campaign turned out to be a chain of arena fights with little-to-no atmosphere, other than knowing 'When you pull the battery out of that thing, mobs will spawn.', followed by what can only be described as a boring and SLOOOOOW jump'n'run sequence, which has no place in DOOM for me.  The multiplayer also got very stale after just a few games. The maps are uninteresting and the characters all look the same. No matter how pre-schoolish you color your characters, they are all bland-looking Doomguys. Quake 3 Arena had tons of different models to choose from, and that was over a decade ago. DOOM's extremly antiquated multiplayer may very well become its downfall.",

I've bested all the original Doom games on UV and have played many of the community made mapsets too (Most of the well known ones are much harder than Classic Doom)  Overall, I generally like what Bethesda has done with the game. And I can say I enjoy this entry to the franchise way more than I did with Doom 3. The campaign is lots of brutal, bloody fun, which is what Doom is all about... And would feel a lot like a modern update to the classic Doom experience if you could run around permanently with the Haste powerup applied to the character. The bosses are a bit underwheling once you know what to do, but it's overall a solid and worthy campaign.  The multiplayer feels a bit on the generic/Quake side, but adding the playable Hellspawn was a nice touch. I haven't dabbled in it too much yet, but I'll throw down some matches once my busy schedule clears up.  I've yet to experiment with SnapMap, but it's on my list of things to do. I have some ideas I'd like to eventually tinker with.  It's not completely perfect, I'll admit, and I don't think it'll ever replace the classic look and feel, but it's pretty solid.  Note: If you're not a FPS veteran, I strongly discourage you from playing on UV or Nightmare.",

It's different than pretty much all other contemporary shooters on the market for a few reasons: namely, this is not a game that rewards those who tend to hang back and shoot from cover. In fact, that's a recipe for getting yourself killed quickly and often. No, this game is for those who have a little more fire in their bones and gasoline in their blood. The game rewards those who perform 'Push-forward' combat, in which you do just that: push forward and kill with the utmost brutality and mercilessness. For those who are just starting out with this game, or who are thinking of picking it up, do it- It's such a cathartic experience to unleash your frustrations and hatred upon demons who are so deserving of it.  From a technical standpoint, the game is also a masterpiece. I've not seen a game this well-optimized in a while. I'm running on my EVGA GTX 970 with an i3-4130 (which is a lower-end dual-core CPU with hyperthreading) and I'm getting well over 100fps at 1080p, sometimes in the 120's, but I keep it locked to 60fps with VSYNC.

Very solid level design and well done boss fights that were fun and challengeing.   Now in contrast to the superb level design the weapon upgrade crap is just poorly implemented. Having the final damage boosting abilities switch to skill based unlocks IMHO is just a nuisance. I made a conscious effort to unlock the final Rocket launcher and Super shotty upgrades by the end of the campaign and was unable to do so. Also, what's the point in making the player invest in lower tier weapon unlocks if by the last half of the game they will be only be using the Gauss cannon, Rocket Launcher, and Super shotty.

Pros: - The weapons are really fun to use and I didn't really have a favourite; they all have their different use-cases - Running and jumping around during combat is a lot more fun than hiding behind cover hoping to not get shot - Lots of secrets and collectibles - Classic Doom maps to play after you finish the campaign (if you can find them that is) - Only 2 unskippable story 'cutscenes', the rest of the story is told through audio transmissions and holograms, and you can just ignore them - Actually got a playable framerate with a Radeon HD7950 at 3440x1440p, and it didn't look too bad - Loading times were bearable, though I do have it installed on my SSD  Cons: - Crashed quite often for no reason at some points. thankfully it saves after you get collectibles and stuff, so it wasn't too big of a deal - Previous sections of the map will close off sometimes during the mission, which is frustrating when you're just looking for collectibles  Overall, if you have $80 (Canadian) to spend, I'd recommend this game. It took me around 12 hours to beat the campaign, and I haven't even found all the collectibles or played any of the classic maps yet.",

[Full disclosure: review is for single player only and I’m not done yet…]  Top 3 reasons to play:  1) Non stop action: every level and gameplay decision was made in favor of ‘makes the game flow better’ (or possibly, ‘makes the gibs fly further’).   Health boosts come from mobs. Combination of melee (glory kills), chainsaw, and health/armor/ammo upgrades mean no more hunting around for that forgotten health pack. The chainsaw, especially, is now super useful to get more health/ammo (risky… but useful).    Gore nests, staged spawn in times, and Summoners make it so there’s no chance of getting the levels wired. To complete some of the upgrade challenges, a Summoner can be left up (though that gets out of hand quickly).    Vertical level design, and the mantle and jump mechanics, are well done. The platforming that’s there, which usually never goes well in an FPS, is spot on. Feels like flying and flows well with normal movement.    Related to the above, there aren’t many stupid geometry/terrain designs (lots of stuff to fall off of though). If you can see a ledge top, more than likely you can reach it. If it looks like you can squeeze between columns/rock walls, very likely you can. Makes it easier to concentrate on gibs...   2) Replayability: secrets, level challenges, suit and weapon upgrades, masteries and rune trials are used for completely different load-outs.   Levels can be replayed as part of the main campaign. This makes is easy to complete missed objectives, weapon masteries and rune trials. Then the new abilities can be used in the main campaign, for new areas. So you can use the load-out you prefer for playing the harder areas.     Masteries and challenges might make you use a weapon a way you wouldn’t normally. Can’t say more without spoilers, but the end result is getting new ways to make even more gibs.    Rune challenges are fun enough that they have their own replay value.    Secrets. Not saying. If you are at all a fan of the series then yeah, you WANT to find all the secrets. If you are a completionist, secret hunting can be used as a breather in between the action hot spots. Or not.   3) Subversive as hell humor, voice overs, and story.   DOOM shines with a storyline that mocks holy hell out of corporate culture and religion equally. The HR spiel from some of the holo-people could’ve come right out of the company I work for. It’s disturbing really.  Voice acting/script/interaction between NPCs is high quality and creative. I actually care what happens to the primary NPCs.  10/10 GotY.

I was sceptical about new Doom as well, but surprisingly it contains everything what was perfect in old Doom. Tons of enemies known from the past vomiting, tearing and fireballing your limbs. You need to run and shoot with your double barrel shotgun like psycho to keep yourself alive, your adrenaline level will be constantly high and you will get addicted into it. New Doom definitely carries the emotion and legacy of its old father with smell of Quake somewhere inside.  The graphics is fast and colorful like the old doom, but you need to have at least 3GB of video ram to avoid slow downs. The level design will keep you entertained constantly where arenas reminded me the old Quake 3.  The sound and especialy music is perfect. Dirty growling enemies mixed with trash metal industrial music will dive your ears into hell, keeping your focus rock solid. Finally if you look for old school hard core shooter in modern graphics, you just need to buy Doom.",

However this Doom is not like the last we had, which was a blend of horror and action, no this Doom goes right back to the roots of the series and pulls no punches in the process.  From the get-go you can see how great the game looks from weapon textures to the bloodstains on the wall, and even though the enemys de-spawn when killed, its still a beautiful bloody mess before they do. when you do go outside on mars it still holds true and looks fantastic, I dont let graphics dictate my purchases though, so lets get down to the good stuff.  I didnt have much of an idea how the single player was going to be, since they havent shown too much, but in the time I HAVE spent with the game has been an absolute blast to play, and it feels SO MUCH like the original dooms it almost makes me sick. The gunplay is smooth, fast and punishing if you slip up. the armor/health around the map is just enough to keep you going, but not enough to hold your hand. THIS IS NOT A HORROR GAME and honestly im torn between hating that and loving it, while I will miss the horror factor from the last game I cant help but welcome my old friend with open arms.  The game has a few new things as well, upgradable weapons, armor, and weapon mods and new to the series and a welcome addition as it matches the gameplay this game has taken.

Pros:   It's pretty refreshing to have a AAA single player shooter that requires some strafeing.   Don't have to reload any clips jus like the good ol days.   The hell levels are very nice to look at and explore.  The gun play feels natural and fun just like in wolfenstein new order  The finishing melee kills don't entirely break the combat flow (I still feel like the game would work fine without it) and the speed of the melee kills can be increased by completing a challenge.   Cons:  This game requires some hefty hardware to run at a full 60 frames at all times. I've been getting 100fps (nothing happening) - 40fps (in the middle of a mosh pit) with v sync off on my gtx 770.   There are a couple of sit-still-and-listen-for-plot-sake moments that are kinda annoying to me.  You get these perks through challenges (nothing wrong with that) but you can only have three perks working at the same time in a ♥♥♥♥ing sinle player game.   EDIT: Just finshed the game and honestly, just like the old games, I just want to play this one over and over again.",

It is a basic 'run and gun' game play with maps to explore, secrets, and just solid controls. Simple, but responsive. Quake built on this after Doom and then Doom 3 tried to give us a creepy version of the original with jump scares but just didn't grab everyone as much.   This Doom is a great re-visit to the original formula. It gives you run and gun - it gives you secrets to uncover. Also some solid FPS platforming. And the visuals really hammer it home. Audio is also great.   And for me, the icing on the cake is the multiplayer. On the surface you may just see more space marines...but lets recall who gave us the original space marine FPS - Doom. So iD has every right to bring this into the fold among your CODs and Halo copy cats.   The gameplay is straight out of the late 90s-early 2000s. Its fast, its brutal, unforgiving, but also very satisfying. After playing so many games that get a little stale with very flat maps, or lacking in control, this game really delivers. You get your double jump back, you get your arsenal of weapons, and trash talking via the built in mic support.   If you played Unreal/Quake online back in the day, get this.  If you enjoy very basic FPS single player built around 'Run and Gun', get this. It is the original FPS experience.  ",

If that was the case the game either crashed instantly or the framerate started to drop drastically in the beginning. Despiting the fact that this game runs solid smooth on my rig (about 90 fps avg on Ultra settings), it's kind of annoying when this happens in the middle of a fight and you have to repeat all over again.  █ Design Aspects █ Secondly the game heavily feels like it has been optimized for console in the first place, even though its developers intended to make it the ultimate next-gen pc game.  Let's have a look on the weapon wheel. If you're about to switch weapons with the help of the weapon wheel, the in-game time slows down in order to suggest that your player is reacting in a lightning-fast way and - of course - to allow easy weapon selection on a controller. My questions here are, why does id Software implemented this feature for the pc version at all, and why do we - as the Masterrace Community - don't get the option to disable either the weapon wheel itself and/or the slow-motion effect?  Now to the hyped Glory Kill System. This is the reason where DOOM (4) got his fast-paced playstyle from, because every time you perform a Glory Kill on an enemy, he drops a ton of health and ammo packs. Looking for resources by roaming whole sectors on the map is in the past and not necessary anymore, except for armor (!there is already a rune to compensate for that!) and BFG ammunition. What I don't like about this is that you're invincible while you perform a Glory Kill. This, again, only seems to attribute to the console generation in order to make things easier for them.  █ Multiplayer █ Until now I haven't tested the MP, but the COD-like Loadout-System and the inability to change weapons during a fight - by picking up weapons dropped by dead enemy players - seems a bit fishy to me. This won't affect my rating for this game since I only focus on the campaign mode.  █ Conclusion █ After all this still doesn't affect my rating for DOOM (4), but you can tell that all negative aspects of this game are in fact referable to the obnoxious console generation.",

Multiplayer: Standard cookie cutter FPS multiplayer that you have probably already seen in CoD or Battlefield, just slightly faster and with OP demon power ups. Probably not worth your time if you want an arena shooter expierence.  Snapmap: The game's 'level editor' is ok but not great for serious modding/level creation. It has a great visual scripting system (at least compared to other games) but customization is very limited. What ruins it is the limit of demons spawned at once wich is capped at 12 and the overall limit is around 50.",

Make sure if you want this game you have a very good CPU and GPU. An APU will never do as I have learned the hard way. Also, Vulkan graphics mode is faster for those of you who use AMD GPUs. I'd like to see them add even lower graphics qualities that way I can have my full resolution scale back and still get a good framerate. Until then, I guess I'll have to suffer the pain of low framerate and a 50% resolution scale. Also, don't bother with DLC; DOOM is just fine without it.",

I get to shoot, punch, and decapitate demons in Hell while playing the worlds most uncaring and destructive protagonist ever. And by uncaring I mean... he will completely disragard warnings, preferences of the 'helpful' characters, and any bloodshed or property damage of any magnitude. He's kinda like that old beer company mascot, Bad Frog, cuz he just don't care. The only problem I have with the game is the weird framerate problems I had at the beginning of my play. When buying this game be prepared to mess with settings. Alot.  Now to what this review is really about. Punz. More specifically, Donald's Puns. (Further warning, THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH DOOM, THAT REVIEW IS DONE!!). So this is going to be something a game show, where I ask questions pertaining to the subject and then answer them. I may go off course.   Question 1: Did Donald make any puns on the night of October 21? Answer 1: Yes... Yes he did.   Question 2: Did Donald make alot of puns? Do you feel that he made too many or too few. Answer 2: He made enough nerd.   Question 3: Were they good puns? Answer 3: What idiot thought that would be a good question? They were punz, you scrub.   Question 4: Please just answer the question.  Answer 4: Fine. I give Donald's punz a D/10 because he's Donald. Practically severed my ears off as soon as he walked through my door.   Question 5: Were they consistant in subject? Answer 5: No, you moron. Punz are situational.   I will now give you time to speak freely.  *Ahem* Overall, I was satisfied at the very end. While not many punz were made that night, he made up for it with Fidel Castro memes. Though I am loathe to admit I am saddened by his lack of Fidelity and Infidelity punz after Fidel Castro became an inside joke. The quality of the punz made me cry and gasp for air. I hereby deem Donald and his punz a choking hazard and I deem Donald himself a biohazard, as my room smelled like Donald after only two hours of him sleeping there. That is all. And by the way.... Those questions... Were straight up PUNishment.",

Good upgrade system on the weapons,  The story is fairly non existent, but you can get a bit of back story about the world if you take the time to read the little bits that show up in your journal as you progress.  The music is a matter of taste. If you don't like technoy dubstep, you're going to grind your teeth down to nothing while playing, or I suppose you could just mute it...  I bought the game fairly late so I didn't run into many problems, though for some reason the game runs like absolute ♥♥♥♥ until the opening credits are done and you get to the main menu.  The price is one thing that really ircs me about this game. It's currently $80 in Canada, which is just too much for a 12 hour SP campaign. Thankfully I was able to pick it for $60 off GMG just a couple weeks ago during a sale. So provided you can get it for a decent price, I'd say recommended.  The other thing that irks me is because of the way the game has been programed, small additions to the game, like the new DLC, requires a massive 12GB download. Until it has been downloaded, your game won't launch. It also now sits on my HDD eating up 62.2 GB of space.  There's also Denuvo to consider. What happens when they stop supporting it? Does the game become unplayable? What of the performance impact?  While the game is fun, price, DRM, and bloated download and install size keep me from recommending this game.  Edit: Denuvo removed. Though the install size now sits at 76 ♥♥♥♥ing GB, so I still can't recommend it.",

I personally dislike how the computer always tell you that you're now safe (when all demons are killed) I always want to feel on edge and 'under attack' like in Doom 1-3 but you don't here, it's I'm under attack!

            "review_text": "DOOM brings a unique fps experience some people that have yet to try it. It's fast paced, has a huge arsenal of weapons to fight with, crazy fun challenges as the difficulty and enemies get harder and has somewhat a simple story line to it. DOOM does not disappoint in terms of it being like the first and second Doom game's which everyone loved. It has references to the old soundtrack in the new one, fast paced gameplay, the right amount of horror and blood and gore. Not to mention the crazy cool new designs to the demons, weapons and Doomguy himself. In most games about hell and demons, normally you'd have to be the 'chosen one' or have some special weapon or blessing to be able to fend off the demons and other satanic related dangers. And on top of that you have to go on some journey to get that blessing, weapon, etc. What's great about DOOM is that you aren't specifically the 'chosen one' to fight em off, you don't have any specific weapon and your already in the battle since the very very beginning of the game. You're just given the normal weapons used in the UAC facility to shoot things until they die. Also DOOM is nothing dirty, doesn't have anything to do with sexual offense, no drugs involved, disrespect of races, genders, etc unlike some popular games out there. If your looking for a 'Kid friendly game' (for audiences at least 12 yrs. and up or if you feel they're already mature enough) then pick DOOM!! :D If you like shooting things mindlessly with intense blood and gore and brutally awesome sequences of you ripping things apart, this game is for you. If you don't like any of those things buy the damn game anyway just cause. 10/10",

If you are into oldskool FPS this is for you. 13/10  Edit: I wasn't sure about the snapmap in the beginning, but to tell you the truth it has grown on me considerably. It is set up much the same way as Little Big Planet, you build it and publish it and if the ratings come in you get featured on the front page. I have played entirely new campaigns that people have built from the ground up, including new renditions of the Classic DOOM done in unbelievable detail. People have been fleshing out the story of the side characters and even the Elite Guards have complete campaigns. There is a limitless amount of single player story campaign and these modes are also available to play with others.",

I'll have the place plastered with gravestones. Every game should have something like this.

            "review_text": "*As of the time of writing this, i've only played ~2 hours of the single-player campaign, this is more or less a first impressions review*  Doom is back and better than ever. Despite the hellish development cycle it went through, id and Bethesda have hit the nail on the head with this absolute gem. I'll go into depth on some of the different aspects below;  Gunplay and the Demons:  Arguably the most important aspect of a Doom game is the arsenal of weapons at your disposal. DOOM captures the absolute brutality of the many weapons up for grabs. Old weapons, like the classic shotgun, plasma rifle and Super shotgun make their return, and there are a few new ones in store. Each weapon has its own time and place to be used effectively, and can be adapted to face numerous situations through a weapon modding and upgrading system. The sound design on the weapons is phenomenal - each weapon feels like it has its own kick, and all of them, including the lowly pistol, sound like they pack one hell of a punch. Of course all these weapons need to pack a punch when you're tearing apart the legions of hell with smoldering lead, or plasma, or your bare hands. All your nasty old friends from Doom return once again; including zombies, Imps, Pinkies and the Barons. Most of them function for the most part like their older counterparts, and some have even been giving secondary and tertiary abilities never before seen. The demons are numerous, bloodthirsty and hell bent on trying to kill you, or are they trying to escape? Either way, pick your tool, and nail those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in all the gore spattered glory that is DOOM.   Gameplay:  DOOM welcomes back the fast and fluid gameplay which made the original Doom and Doom II so good, and even introduces a few new aspects that can be observed as derivatives from fan mods (such as Brutal Doom). The glory kills mechanic fits into the fluidity of the combat extremely well. In no sense does it hinder your progress to curb stomp an Imps' head in. Movement, aiming and navigation are smooth, and surprisingly quick, calling back to the old Quake days. The maps (which are bloody massive by the way) can be traversed in a number of different ways; they're often broken up into many interconnected pathways comprised of ledges, tunnels, platforms and pathways. There are secrets around every corner, and a number of unique collectables always keep you peeking around each corner. One of the best things about DOOM is its rewarding of exploration. Whether you find some extra ammo, a new gun, or a Doomguy figurine, finding those secrets is extremely rewarding. The game praises you for taking time to explore your surroundings.   The Soundtrack:  Ho-ly ♥♥♥♥. The composer of the score (who also did the scores for Wolfenstein and numerous other projects) absolutely nails the soundtrack. Go look up 'BFG Division' on YouTube. Seriously - a picture, or in this case a song, speaks a thousand words.   To summarise, if you're interested in one of the most metal single-player FPS experiences to date, absolutely pick up this game. For Doomguys old and new, DOOM is the Doom we've been waiting for.   RIP AND TEAR!",
