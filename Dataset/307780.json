And they somehow still have the balls to still sell it for $60 for the base game only on PC. They fired the team who was managing the PC port not very long ago, so I guess this abandonment isn't too much a surprise.  I'm glad I bought this game+DLC for 5 bucks total which was a trade with some kid from China.

Best menu simulator to date.  ---------------------- UPDATE: So they have actually gone ahead and released the XL package with the missing characters, and fixed a ton of crap.

I started with MK2 back when i was 7 years old. I grew up with MK. This game isn't the worst MK, seeing as we have abominations like armageddon and MK Gold in our past, but it's certianly a huge waste from a team i know can do better.  Commands still randomly drop, you'll not perform a combo because that game sometimes doesn't feel like it. Fighting otherwise feels pretty meh. It's more like injustice than MK9 to be quite honest and i don't consider that to be a good thing.   The unlock system is totally and completely busted. The Krypt is now a maze with jumpscare QTEs and multiple branching paths. So what used to be a simple task is now a chore.  The story mode is back, and the story is in a word: Boring. It tells of shinnok's return, but from the perspective of a bunch of newbies no one cares about and are presented as unlikably as possible, or from Johnny and Sonya's perspective. Everyone cool is a quan chi wraith.  There's multiple unplayable fighters in the game, such as Rain, Tanya(!) Sindel, This presents the game as a bad value. An unfinished 'Starter pack' of a game you have to pay to unlock at a later date. I don't know about you, but when I buy something, say a cookie, i don't want hald the chocolate chips picked out then sold to me for 25 cents extra and delivered next week when the cookie's all hard and stale. This game is extremely spendy. Buy costumes, Buy Characters, But Easy fatality tokens, Buy this, Buy that, Instead, just don't buy the game.  So let's say, you don't have a problem with any of that. You can deal with the dropped combos, Locked on-disc characters don't bother you, And DLC? Bah! All games are doing it. Fine then slick. Game randomly CTDs for virtually no reason at all. I have a more stable gaming experience with a modded up the wazoo skyrim than i do MKX. I don't think i've ever seen an unmodded game crash so much. Despite my drivers being the latest version and the game being updated almot daily it seems, the game still crashes like a drunk driving a bumpercar.  This is not even by FAR the worst mortal kombat. That would be unchained on PSP. Or maybe trilogy on tiger  Game.com  handheld(google it). Or maybe even the tiger electronics card swipe Mortal Kombat handheld LCD game. But this game is in NO WAY worth 60 dollars, let alone 80 for the full version. More like the Fools Version. If you can pick this game up 3 years after the fact at christmas for 20 bucks, Hey you got yourself a good deal. Maybe they'll even fix the game by then! But as it stands, it's a stinking pile of garbage.",

I often get messages that Faction related gameplay is disabled due to server connection failure.

Also, note that I'm leaving out a lot of other issues I've experienced. Even after a 15 Gb (yes, giga) update, we still need more fixes.  If you have a PS4 or Xbone, buy MKX for that instead.

            "review_text": "I've been a Mortal Kombat fan for a looong time, starting on the original MK1 (on SNES). The reboot that was MK9 was one of my biggest videogame highlights of the last generation. With MKX I was super stoked and after a kind of horrible launch on PC and months of fixing it to make it a flawless gaming experience I can finally say that it may be the perfect Mortal Kombat game ever.  I got more than 200 hours of playtime by now and I still enjoy it like ever, but I'm kind of afraid playing online because the netcode isn't the best there is. But it could have changed, now that there seems to be a new netcode implemented into the game.  But I was wrong.  I looked forward to two new features to the game, which was on one side the already mentioned new netcode and on the other side the new Kombat Pack.  After Kombat Pack 1 and dozens of skins, fatalaties, stage brutalies and such added to the game I've always seen Kombat Pack 2 as the final content that should roundup MKX. I never asked for a Kombat Pack 3 or maybe even a Story Pack, because after so much content it would seem way too greedy asking for more. Instead NRS should start focussing on their next game.  So what could have gone wrong with this last extra content?  The only thing I wouldn't have expected: DROPPING THE COMPLETE PC SUPPORT.  No final DLC, no additional balance or performance patches, and maybe not even the new skins, who knows. Also the new netcode which could have erased the only major issue with the game seems to be not added to the PC version.  This is pure scam and not acceptible. So what if the reason behind dropping PC support is the fact that there were only about half a million copies sold on this platform? Is it the gamers fault? The fault of honest customers?  Maybe its the fault of WB Games and NRS in the first place, hiring people to make the PC port who were clearly overburdened with this job. Maybe that's the reason such a small amount of people bought the PC version of the game because it was ♥♥♥♥ed in the first place?  As of now, I sadly cannot recommend buying this game. Not because the game is bad, but because the way WB Games and NRS are treating their fans and customers.",

The fact is who is a wider audiende? People who can buy a 300-400 console or those who can spend 2000 on a gaming PC. It's simple math really.

Oh, and the netcode is virtually unplayable. Well done, NRS, HVS and WB!  As for the actual gameplay? Read on if you're a fighting game fan: The game is full of unreactable overheads and most characters have devolved into 50/50 coin-flippers. Intelligent gameplay requiring you to condition your opponent to open them up is now replaced by cointosses thanks to the unreactable nature of certain mixups. For casuals this is a godsend because it means they don't need to think or work for their damage. For hardcore fighting game fans it means you can be destroyed by less intelligent, less practiced opponents because you are literally given no chance to react to certain attacks (for example, Reptile's overhead).  There are already infinites being discovered and posted on YouTube because NRS doesn't understand how framedata works. This is a party game, not a serious competitive game. If you take it too serious you're going to be let down.  The only good thing about the game is the art and animation. For that I give it a 1 out 10 instead of a straight up 0.

They release a patch which is supposed to bring the Steam port of MKX into line with the console ports, but then are required to pull that self same patch because it corrupts save data. So now Steam players neither have Jason, which they paid for, nor their save data, which they played for.  I myself have been working hard in the Black dragon faction. I was level 50, and was slaving on unlocking Wicked Laser, the last faction kill. My profile level was around 60, and I was getting so close to the level 65 achievement. I had millions of coins from constant play, which I was planning to use in the krypt. I had tons of unlocked items, including backgrounds, icons, borders, costumes, etc, etc, not to mention a lot of leveling up of Liu Kang.  All of this is now rendered moot. I now am level 6 in Black Dragon with only one Faction Kill, no leveling up of Liu Kang, only 16 thousand coins (10 thousand of that as a result of their pitiful attempt at compensation for their ridiculousness), none of my unlocked icons, borders, or backgrounds (I have a whopping 4 backgrounds available to me at present), am level 5 in my profile, etc, etc, etc.  I don't know how in the world they managed to release an update that could corrupt save data that badly, nor do I know how or indeed if they even plan to make things right. Furthermore, they required that I download 15 GB worth of data to update to the version that had Jason and destroyed my save data, and then was required to download yet again another 15 GB worth of data to remove Jason, any updates meant to bring the PC version into line with the console versions, and my game progress, just to sweeten the deal.  I can only assume that this is part of a 'Fresh Start' package being offered by Nether Realms, but if so, I don't know why they didn't charge me yet another micro transaction to enjoy the concept.  I wish that I could convince Valve to recall Mortal Kombat X, and force WB to refund Steam members the cost of the game and any additional content that might've been purchased as a result, including the Premium Edition or Kombat Pack.  This is without even mining the treasure trove that is the poorly executed net code. Last night, I was playing a game with a pal, and at one juncture, the game basically turned into the world's slowest slideshow of different poses.  Nether Realms obviously doesn't care about the PC gaming market, which is why they outsource the development of that port to a third party. If they really didn't care about it, though, they should've made it a console exclusive, rather than taking money from people for a poorly tested, poorly supported, and poorly executed version.  Many people have been saying that pirated versions of this game work better, and while I am not advocating piracy, perhaps it would be the way to go in order to get your money's worth. Thanks but no thanks, Nether Realms and High Voltage. My next game from you will in all likelihood come from ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, not from the Steam Store.",

I've always loved Mortal Kombat. the Reboot (MK9) was brilliant and i was hoping this would be too.  I don't play the MK series for the flashy graphics and story. Gameplay is massively important and MK X lacks in pretty much all areas of gameplay. Sorry Ed Boon, maybe next time you'll focus on development of quality gameplay before you decide on an art style and pretty textures.  Another thing that really frustrates me is how ridiculous the combat is. . . it literally says in the title 'Mortal' Kombat. Yet the characters shrug off debilitating moves like it's nothing. the X-ray moves are just a gimick and lack the same weight as they did in the MK9 and again are ridiculous in terms of gore. most of them would leave you straight up dead  If you're thinking of picking up a modern Mortal Kombat, do yourself a favour and pick up MK9. it is superior with features like:  - 4 player offline co-op (yes this was removed from MK X for some stupid reason) - Huge playable character count - satisfying and weighty combat - Less cheesy one liners - CHEAPER - and much more, i just have games to be playing and can't spend an evening typing a long ♥♥♥ review out.

With the reboot of the series in the previous title, I never imagined there would be good storytelling in story mode, it was always just background on characters and people starting up rumors on what is happening with which character and whatnot, With the latest titles, I'm actually glad I can enjoy a cinematic experience, even if it is not that entertaining to some.   Combat (That is how it is spelled -.-) has improved significantly since the last title and X-Ray moves have been 'nerfed' so as to not let the player depend on them. There are also Easy Fatalities and Skip fight bonuses claimed during story mode and versus or online. The Krypt is much more entertaining than the last one. It feels like an Adventure game although it gets boring at times. All in all the game ran smoothly.  However, it didn't run that smoothly as a PC version. There are way too many issues that it pains me to not recommend this port for simple reasons. While I was halfway through story mode my save has been deleted because the game updated itself, to my knowledge. Sure enough, I threw my frustration aside and decided to beat story mode again, this time skipping all the cutscenes till I reached 80% of the story mode. After finishing story mode, it happens again. Fool me once shame on you, Fool me twice, Shame on me. Shame on me for not having a backup file, sure. But the fact of the matter is that it shouldn't' have happened in the first place and I'm sure if it was on a console, I would have uploaded my save and just downloaded it again. This is not a matter of preference in consoles, it's just from what I've experienced is this port is the least functional one. Hopefully it gets fixed in the future, but don't waste your money on this port for now.",

This is truly a great game, singleplayer is extremely fun and it feels very fluid and smooth.  Online however, is a different story. Pulling off kombos is extremely difficult compared to offline, at some times the game doesnt even register one of my button presses - for example, down forward X is Kitana's fan throw. Offline, I get this 100% of the time. Online, I stand there looking like a fumbling idiot who is punching whilst crouched on the other side of the arena. Even simple things such as finding your opponents ping takes too long. King Of The Hill is filled with lag, finding a versus game physically hurts me.   I also run the game at highest settings, full 60fps and console videos look better. This just isn't right, for any game.  I cannot recommened this game for the price. Maybe 3 hours of story mode and some offline, but not enough to keep any player who payed £35 satisfied. The online play is broken, and thus I would not recommend this game until it has been fixed.   Buy the game in a years time, unless they have already brough out another, in that case be severely disapointed again.",

An iconic character like Goro and they insult fans by making his anticipated playable debut (ignoring the Game Boy) locked behind a paywall.

I loved Mortal Kombat 9 with all my friends and I figured I would pre-purchase Mortal Kombat X on PC, due to that being my now main platform. Well what an absolute mistake I can say that was.   Let me start at the beginning. There was a tonne of launch issues, including it being said to be released, when it really wasn't, then when we actually got to download the game, they did so in this ridiculously temperamental format where you would download packs, that contained part of the game. Well they ♥♥♥♥ed that up too and we was left without the game HOURS after launch.   THEN when we actually got to play the game, the single player had a tonne of save corruption issues, preventing you from playing the damn game properly, multiplayers netcode was absolutely abysmal and most matches was just a lagfest where your opponent just destroyed you due to input lag. Then on the occasion that you didn't lose, the game would abruptly end due to the lag disconnecting both players for some bloody reason.  So, you'd think after such an appauling launch they would seek to ammend these bugs right? Well, sort of. They pushed out 2 - 3 half ♥♥♥♥♥ updates that fixed some of the issues. While it did that, I remember it actually WIPING PLAYERS SAVE FILES. How can you even justify that?   So then after that, we got Kombat Pack 1 and all the support was dropped and we got NOTHING for 7 months. This whole ordeal has been the biggest neglect to customers I have ever seen. It's actually astounding. No comments from Ed Boon, Warner, nobody.   So now out of the blue they are like ' oh you guys WANT MK XL on PC? ' ofcourse we did! you said this game on pc would be equal to the console version in every way. So now thats in beta and I honestly have to say that everyone who has MKX on pc deserves XL for absolutely free as a way of making up for the atrocious pc support. It'd be criminal not to at this point.  As of right now, I would never recommend purchasing a game done by Warner Bros for pc. I don't think this is as much Neatherrealms fault as much as it is Warner Bros, but still. Wouldn't recommend.",

Welcome to Mortal Kombat X for PC, one of the worst game ports I've ever played. Dozens of useless patches to help destroy your bandwidth limit and senselessly fill your hard drive. This game is fundamentally broken and is about as balanced as playing tug-of-war with 200 fat kids. I'd rather hit my own genitals with a hammer than play this game. Seriously I would even play Mortal Kombat Special Forces over this game.   Awful port aside the game just isn't good. I don't know what the hell NetherRealm Studios was trying to do with this game, but I think they failed. Now you may be thinking 'But this game is new, it takes time to fix!', well I can tell you right now, no amount of patching will make this game any better. It's an absolute joke of an addition to the fighting game genre. It lacks the mechanics that generally make a game good. As a long time fan of the MK series it saddens me that this game is probably the worst new game I've played in the last 2 to 3 years. I don't understand how they went from MK9 to this one.  Why do they keep hiring High Voltage Software to do their ports, this company is garbage at what they do. Their ports of MK9 and Injustice for PC were plagued by the same issues and they're still not fixed. It must be really awesome to do shoddy half-cocked work and still get paid for it. Where can I sign up, I enjoy phoning it in on a daily basis and disappointing tens of thousands of people simultaneously. I'd be perfect for them!  Anyway I guess that sums it up.  2/10 would not bang.

            "review_text": "Of the series, I've only played Mortal Kombat 9 prior to this, on the PC. I loved it. The story, the feel of the combat, Johnny Cage. So I was pretty pumped to hear that MKX was on its way.   At release and for the next year and a half, there were issues with netcode and performance on middle of the range computers. There was a recent patch that really fixed a lot of the performance drops I was noticing. I am running what would now be classed as a low end machine, and it can still run the game at 1920x1080 on low with some spikes here and there, where as before I had to lower the resolution significantly. Apparently the netcode is much better, but I'm in Australia, so no amount of software wizardry will help our small population and crap internet.  As for the combat, it is so damn smooth. I loved 9 because I thought it felt great, but now that feels slow and clunky. Everything just flows. You will need to play to understand what I mean, as I won't be able to get it across in words. The characters are quite varied, allowing for all manner of play styles. Each character has 3 variations (and one has an extra secret one you can go and hunt down if you are interested), which really allows you to tailor a character to your needs. The DLC characters are quite expensive, but they are good fun. Kombat Pack 2 is especially good. Try to nab them on special, but really they are not crucial; the game will still be very satisfying without them, and you won't feel underpowered against people using them.  The story is good, but didn't feel as good as 9 for some reason. The cut scenes were done really well, and bridged into combat nicely. The living towers are a good addition, but it is a bit of a shame that the Challenge Tower has been removed. Another feature I miss is having tag teams so that you could coop. Otherwise everything else in this game has just been made bigger and better.  Graphically, the game is incredible. Even on low settings it looks really good. The environments are really detailed, and the particle effects have some really nice qualities to them, such as their patterns, lighting, etc. The Fatalities and the X-Ray moves are all pretty full on, and the Brutalities are nice to have back. The animations during combat are really smooth as well, a lot of time was clearly put in to making them feel good.  Overall, for fighting fans, definitely grab the game, especially now that it has been fixed up. If you are interested in getting into fighting games, this is a good place to start I think, as it can be a bit more forgiving on combos than other fighters. If you aren't interested in fighters, don't get this game, it will offer nothing you want.  You have no idea how much I wanted to substitute all words beginning with C with K....",

Cons: - Can sometimes refuse to cooperate properly with certain graphics cards, but enough tweaking will fix this. - Frame rate locked at 30 during x-rays. - Netcode isn't flawless, but it's certainly a lot better than it was pre-XL. - No Kintaro.

I will of course leave my old review which was marked as Negative below this new review. I honestly can't wait to get stuck in again and enjoy some MKXL. The Beta was fantastic and the performance was flawless on my near decade old AMD Phenom 965 BE and my 2012 R9 280X. I fully reccomend any fans of the game and previous players give this a shot. I've paid more for a Burrito than this KP2. Worth it for me but make you're own choice! I hope this helps.    PREVIOUS NEGATIVE REVIEW BELOW:  I've had over 300 hours logged on MKX. I feel in my opinion its a great game, with some passionate devs, this came out just about unplayable but now its pretty good to go, atleast single player and online with friends on private matches. It runs great now as well.  However it really pains me to have a featured game on my profile lose all support for its PC platform. Kombat pack 2 was announced. No mention of changes to PC for about a couple of weeks and we only recently found out that it won't be coming via a tweet. That to me is like an Ex girlfriend dropping the relationship via a text. Its just not right for something you've spent so much time on, loving the experiences, going through the hardships of the horrible launch just to see it thrown away in the end. I feel Ed and his team at Neverealm would have this on PC if they could. I don't know for sure but its been obvious through most of last year the higher ups at Warner Bro's don't listen to a word their devs say to them nevermind the fans of their owned franchises.  This paints a picture WB are very angry with PC gaming at this moment due to the botched Arkham Knight release on steam, They do not wish to support it anymore. They thought they could get by releasing on PC with using the most cheapest Developers out there to Contract their PC ports but since they couldn't anymore and it actually required a decent investment, They've essentially pulled out of PC gaming for the forseeable future. I doubt we'll be getting Injustice 2 or anything like that. They've not given Netherealm the resources or skills to produce on PC. Ed can't just code that himself and WB are not providing for us anymore.   Pick this up on some CD Key site for 10 bucks with Kombat Pass 1. You'll not be giving them anymore money as you bought from a re-seller who already has provided WB with a cut for the key.",

Mortal Kombat X has really taken the series to a new level with the introduction of 'FACTION' game mode along with the general leveling system in place and let's not even get started in how amazing the layout for the Krypt is.   The characters are very unique in their own way and the three different fighting variations brings a lot more attention to your chosen fighting style. The stage interaction is fanstatic and allows room for that final epic blow just before the announcer shouts 'FINNISH HIM'.   The online play is loads of fun as well with many options and game modes to choose from, so go explore it for yourself.   I would seriously recommend this game to any fan of the series or for anyone that is into fighting games or someone who likes to purchase a game that will give you hours and hours of play time because lets face it, Call of Duty does not have a single player mode this fun.

Old Review:  Today's Review: Mortal Kombat X  Overview and impressions: I'll start for saying, i dind't have any optimization problems at all with this game, runs complelty fluid on max settings to a constant of 60 fps, thenfore i really enjoy it the time i've played it, didn't finished the story because honestly i wasn't in this game for the story to start with, the game improves over MK9 with graphics and mechanics but it has less kombatans than the previous game, that means a little rooster of fighters to play with, it add factions which are completly useless unless you really like leaderboards and adds more modes for single and multiplayer modes, what makes me vote down this game is the recent announcement, a few days ago i saw that it was coming a second Kombat Pack that includes 5 more characters to the roaster and Warner Bros decided to abandon the pc confirming there will be no Enhaced Online Pc support or Kombat Pack 2, being said that, a publisher/developer that abandons a game does not deserve a thumbs up, furthermore i have the MKX Premium Edition so being a supporter of the franchise this is insulting for me, shame on you and shame on your greedy console eyes.  What this means to us as pc players?  - No improving netcode to online games (online multi is broken) - No kombat pack 2 or new characters - No new dlc maps or stages - No future support patches or updates, ever  Do not buy this game on pc or consoles, you're supporting a company that ♥♥♥♥♥ on their loyals customers that pay for this game with their hard earned money.",

The extras like living towers, challenges and the krypt are also very nice additions. The krypt is basically a mini dungeon crawler inside the game where you collect artifacts to progress further and further, while you spend koins to unlock different items like Skins, fatalities, brutalities, concept art and fan art. Living towers are basically mini story modes where you gotta kill characters to progress higher up the tower.  The online matchmaking is still kinda slow and sometimes i suffer from gamecrashes.

As someone who played the previous Mortal Kombat game, I can testify that the fighting system and feel of the moves is much more robust and improved. This is a game that has been well-worked on and refined to allow for precise and feel-good execution of moves. I cannot recommend it enough.  COMPLAINTS ABOUT MULTIPLAYER SLOWNESS CANNOT BE APPLIED TO ALL USERS. It is incredibly variable and mostly dependent on individual internet capabilities, and widespread lag has been greatly reduced since the first few weeks.  In addition to gameplay mechanics, MKX features a wide variety of specializable characters that allow for a new fight every time. All 25-odd Non-DLC characters feature 3 different variations, essentially giving the game 100 different play-styles if all DLC is acquired. Each character has unique dialogue, and if Scorpion is fighting Mileena, he will refer to her by name or trait in one of several intros. It is remarkable that a game with such exceptional gameplay has such strong characters as well, but you can believe that you will find at lease 6 characters unbelievably bad-♥♥♥ in some way.  I play Liu Kang almost exclusively. He has three variations, each giving him different special moves and essentially redefining his playstyle. Each variation also gives him a slightly new skins. He also has a number of skins purchasable or obtainable through gameplay. He has hundreds of lines of dialogue and his character model looks and behaves great. I only play one character and still have a blast with MKX.  If you can afford it or catch it on sale, MKX is fun for all and replayable for hours, online or offline. If you are not very good, playing against easy bots offline is still fun and will refine your reflexes and skills quickly. The revolutionary practice mode is difficult to explain but impressive and remarkably useful. If you have any doubts, check out the Mortal Kombat Community channel on YouTube for some cool trailers and character breakdowns.  3 TIPS FOR AN MK BEGINNER 1. Pick an easy character to start with. Scorpion is great, as is Sub-Zero 2. Some projectiles will hit you if you crouch-duck but not if you simply duck 3. Don't button-mash, don't projectile-spam, and BLOCK",

So I've played this for 8 hours, yeah not that impressive but it doesn't take me long to be interested in something. I must say it's a damn good addition to the franchise!  First off, I'm going to start by saying that I've been playing Mortal Kombat since it's early days on the Super Nintendo and Genesis. Those games never failed to keep me interested, I found them more interesting than the homework I was supposed to be doing, lol. Anyways, onto my review.  What really drew me into this game was the ability to play it locally on PC with my wife and MKX's sheer crazy brutality the installment has (not speaking of the special move) The overall presentation is nice and it feels great. Yes, it is a bit slower than any previous games but it's a good slow. Granted I do prefer the faster combat of the previous game but the fighting in this game actually works to a degree, it actually feels strong and impactful.  Visually, the game is pretty compelling if you have the machine for it (and thank goodness I do!) I mean it's detailed enough to where you actually see beads of sweat on the characters, all the way down to the smaller details in the clothing. Still on visuals, there are times where there's a framerate drop while you're in the middle of fight and it could mean life or death for your character.  As far as sound goes...hmm, well there were times where I had to restart the game to fix some crackling and lipsync to sound mismatching in story mode but if you can hear through all of that, good on you.  The storyline is damn fun for sure, it's like you're immersed into a interactive movie to a large degree. I won't spoil anything for you but it was a good storyline. It takes the events of '98's MK4 on the PC, N64, and PS1 and sugar coats it with some twists and turns but the story is still the same at it's core.  I really wish I could say more but if you're looking for a game to play at parties, a fan of the originals, the need to beat stuff up after a long day at work, gore, and the pleasent sound of bones breaking this game will quench that thirst for sure.  Pros: - Great Graphics, feels real, and looks amazing. - Gameplay is slow, but it delivers a more impactful feel as opposed to previous installments. - Love the amount of characters to choose from. - The Storyline is probably the best one I've seen ever in this franchise.  Cons: - Frequent framerate problems. - Sounds are very crackly at times as well as lipsync mismatches (specifically in Story Mode) - Questionable business practices.  All in all I think it's a fine addition save for the few problems I've mentioned above.  8.5/10",

If you are going to flop on the important basics then couldnt they have tried a 3d arena..?! Yeah this game looks great but they blood isnt even convincing which is the main selling point of mortal kombat. The violence without good blood animation is wasted. Characters dont even damage well so it feels frustrating to keep playing with limited effect. Great they tried some new stuff with faction wards but it still feels disconnected and pointless. The story is ok but yeah here we go again with a butt load of quicktime button push sequences. Yeah that feels like fighting,..

Not 10 out of 10, because it has some things missing. Do not let the low user review rating decieve you: most of the negative reviews don't review the game, but only its launch.  Gameplay and combat: Gameplay is the most important aspect of a fighting game. And in this field Mortal Kombat X truly shines. The movesets are interesting and fluid, and the fights have a really nice pace. The combat mechanisms are a little bit more complex than in MK9, which in my opinion is a good thing, but then again, kombos are pretty easy to learn, so something for everyone here. As a downside some of the moves allow some very cheesy tactics, but this is common in fighting games in general.  All the characters have three different stances from which you pick one before the fight. The stances change some special moves and the way the character is played. Its impact differs from character to character.  Story: No spoilers here, but the story is good for a fighting game. It's not a novel by G.R.R. Martin, but it kept me interested. I was actually surprised how well some of the characters were written.  Roster: The roster is missing out some characters I would have loved to play (for example Baraka), but it's not a huge issue. The game and story has to move forward, right? All in all the roster is full of interesting characters, and some of the new ones really shine.  Performance: Some people have had big performance issues, but I for one get a solid 60fps and everything has been smooth on high settings after I updated to amd's newest beta CCC (Rig: i5 3570k, HD7950 3gb, 8gb ram). There should be more options, for example more AA options. Now there's only FXAA which some people find bad.  Multiplayer: Sometimes it takes a long, long time to find a ranked match online, which sucks. Other than that the online matches have been good. Local multiplayer feels very limited. Tag teams are missing. I would also want to be able to form a local multiplayer team and fight online against other teams. But no.",

I actually enjoyed the story mode for this one. Its a good mortal kombat but with WB bad ports of late I'm glad I never pre order anything and bought this for super cheap.

The game works for me; I do think that that netherealm should continue to tweak the game so it is playble for a wide variety of pc's (in terms of how powerful they are). Now the game itself is a masterpiece fighting game. The controls are fast and responsive, the combo posibilities are endless and the classic ending kills are more brutal and detailed than ever. The gameplay is outstanding and is addicting as hell. The idea of the Kombat pack is really stupid and I would reccomend people to buy it on another website that supports steam purchases for a lower price. Other than this, X is an outstanding fighter and may be the best Mortal Kombat to date. I really hope that more patches come out to meet the needs of those who cannot run it properly. 9.2/10.",

I do have a big issue with the Online. On my computer, online matches are usually laggy, which makes it very hard to play. I had to play someone with a half second delay on my attacks, and that was very frustrating. Overall, the game is worth a purchase at full price if you love the Mortal Kombat franchise.

Literally the only complaint I have about this game is that the female fighter's outfits are less sexy this time around. But hey, I have Dead or Alive 5 for that.

Characters are well detailed as well as backgrounds. Animations are excellent as well. Some areas could be improved but after all is just a fighting game.  Sound: 9/10 Most of the sound, sounds realistic and soundtracks are fine. There's no much to say in here since is not like we're gonna get an OST music at the style of a RPG game.  Gameplay: 6/10  Even though there's a good selection of characters, mode, stages, etc. the gameplay is way hurt by the bad development team who ported the game to PC. Sometimes game stutters a lot even when there's not much going on in the background, at first I thought it was my PC (gtx 750 ti, 8gb RAM DDR3 1600mhz, 1TB 7200 RPM HDD, i5 4440) but I even tried on the different setup (gtx 970, 16gb RAM DDR3 1800mhz, 256gb SSD, i7 4730k) but same thing happens. Game is poorly ported. As well online sometimes has lags, but other days it just play fine. I'm sure is not my internet because I do play other online games and that does not happen.  Final result: 7.7  I really wouldn't care if I had purchase this game for just 20$, but I did pre order it for 59.99$ (didn't purchase the Kombat Pack and I think I wont do it) and we've been getting a lot of problems since day one. Multiple patches I do believe like a total of 4 o 5 which in a total makes for 60GB of patches? and they don't bring any solution but more problems.  On top of that, on day one you get one strange install system, Stream installing which really s*ck! to the point they had to remove it. Next time don't try new things on AAA released games or even AA.  My advice, wait till they release a Komplete Edition (like they did with MK9) bet it would come fully playable with all fixes, that if they really get there act together. We know developing is not easy at all, but thats not an excuse to release an unfinished product, and on top release a DLC not even passing a 3 or 6 months after the release date.  I would recommend the game, but only if you can get it for 20$ at least. 30$ for the premium edition.",

I think it's cool that they added this stuff, but if anyone, that includes me, wants to use dlc characters and play online, i'd say just be patient until they fix everything. Yes, the fact that they released with all of those unfixed patches and bugs is a ♥♥♥♥♥ and a half to deal with, but for now just focus on the core of the game.  So that being said, my honest review of MKX is... it's a great game. Bugs aside, it offers a fresh reboot to the series, even if the story mode lacked a bit storywise. The gameplay feels slick and fun, all of the characters are given unique movesets to shake things up, and the new X-ray moves and fatalities are... to say the least, brutal. If you are going to play this on PC, make sure that you have as computer with an updated graphics card, enough space for the game so that you won't settle for the minimum requirements, and other things of that nature, because no one wants a laggy and slow MK experience.  One of the new modes they added was the ability to join one of the factions, like Lin Kuei or Black Dragon, and fight in a competitive online modeto win gold and rewards.  So all in all, this was a great game. Slick gameplay, brutal X-rays and fatalities, unique characters, and the new online mode. It would have been a better experience for everyone if they released it fully without its bugs and patches, but until then they are slowly building it back up to what fans expected. Just make sure your computer has the power to handle it.",

But this is said to late as the community has barley anyone to share with anymore. this game lost its biggest player base after the release of a broken game. I enjoy this game and will still play it, and reccomend it to all but this game lost alot of credabillity at its release.   On a side not the gameplay is great and the feel of a new mortal kombat is awesome (coming from a past MK3 player).  In short, the game suked at the beginning and was unplayable, it is now fixed for the most part but is not worth this $60 dollars. Personally look on other websites that sell CD keys or even amazon. I personally like this game but the start was terrible and it just sucked. Other than that the game works now.",

I just finished the main game about 2 days ago. The story was ok, quite a few suprising moments for the people who were killed in the story mode: meaning they will not be around in the next MK XI. The online I have not had any problems, did have a few matches but not that many. I played quite a bit of the other modes. I never had any of the extensive problems people have documented in the discussion forums, so I cannot say on those problems(things like save deletes and the such did not happen to me)  I did experience a small problem last week with the game not letting me continue story mode, I was in Takeda's chapter and everytime I put continue and the cutscene where Jax's daughter says: 'now I know why my dad retired' played, it instantly crashed. Luckily I decided to check file integrity and turns it out it was missing some update that was about 315 MB (which is weird because it was downloading a 15 GB patch shortly before this problem)  In general: the game is much more fluid in movement than MK9, the krypt is awesome, pretty fun overall.  My only gripes are the following:  1) very few stages and none have stage fatalities  2) I think the variations were pointless(for example, in Raiden, only one variation I think had the teleport but the other didn't) I think this was wasted space having essentially clones of each character with different moves when this could have been used for more charcters  3) personal gripe: NO SHANG TSUNG!!!  4) Guest characters - I really DON'T like these characters, they don't relate to MK and just waste space for other potential characters that were cut(for example, in the story mode alone there are many characters that could have been included that were NPC's here, like: Sareena, Frost, Baraka, Sindel, Li Mei, Rain, Bo Rai Cho, Fujin) also I don't like how they are on the main character select screen, I am not going to buy Jason or Predator and so having their icon greyed out on my main screen looks bad to me because it looks like I have not unlocked everything and I am a completionist so that bothers me, it should have been like in MK9 where there was a subscreen for DLC and guest characters and out of sight from the main roster.  if you are a loyal MK fan like me, you'll love this, I love it despite the minor personal problems I have with it...been playing since the good ol' days so it feels a lot like UMK3, which is my 2nd favorite after MKII",

They did fix a good amount of the issues, but it is still, by far, the worst version of the game. If you have an Xbox One or PS4, I recommend you take one of those options instead.  2. The online play is complete garbage. Unplayable, if you ask me.  3. The game has been completely abandoned by WB. No more fixes, no more improvements, and no future DLC. Very sad, for those of us that are resisting buying a console.  To summarize, I do not in any way regret buying this game. I have had, and continue to have, and great time with it.

Based on what others are saying I think it's safe to say general complaints about the technical quality of the title should be discarded at this point.  As for the quality of the game as a fighter, it's just a really fantastic offering. I think I've played just about every fighter made and I'm going to say this is likely my favorite 2D fighter of all time. It does reward aggression, but it is by no means a shallow game getting by on flash and gore. It balances fun and depth with great success, and it does it looking better than anything I think has ever been done (with Injustice coming up right behind it.)  There were a lot of past MK entries where the characters started to blur together, but this one does a wonderful job of making all of the characters feel unique, and the variations mean that almost any character you want to use has a chance to fit the way you play AND be competitive with high tier characters.  I love it. I really, really love it.  ***update With news today that the PC version is not going to receive the Kombat Pack 2 content, this version of the game may have just became a sale only item. MKXL looks like it will be wrapping the game up, not just with some extra characters, but with what is appearing to be massively improved net code for online play. The early beta testing is looking very positive, but we won't be getting that. This means you will need to be happy with playing the game offline, short 4 characters, and with dated balancing (new balancing is showing up in the net code beta.)  That's unfortunate news among some really good news. With upcoming KI and SFV showing strong dev support, serious PC gamers may need to look those directions.  For everyone else, if the game goes on sale then it's still a really good buy for someone that isn't looking for online play and doesn't care if they are playing with the latest balancing. If you want to take the game seriously then you will need console, but otherwise there is still a lot of game to enjoy.",

Yes lag sucks and you dont know if your opponets internet is good enough until you get in game. There is how ever a connection bar to see how strong it is but it sometimes  doesn't load or it's not accurate.  Overall Mortal Kombat X for Pc is a gem that isn't pollished yet. Wait for a few fixed. Buy it. Play it. Get rekt in noobs only versus people with 300/51 win lose rate. Jokes aside this game is really fun but just needs some fixes",

            "review_text": "I bought and downloaded this game at launch. Even though I have a rig that is more powerful than the recommended specs for this game, the Game still intermittently slows down at times, and then runs normally. Figuring it was rig, I reconfigured the video options, adjusted them down somewhat, but the intermittent slow downs continued. I read online that this slow down issue was due to the way the game launched, downloading patch after patch while simultaneously allowing you to play it. As of this writing, the game doesn't slow down as much, but still lags at times. Note: I have been playing in Single Player and Fection modes so far. I have yet to even touch the online Multiplayer modes.   The features in this MK game are enough for me to recommend this game, despite the glitches experienced at Launch - but with a caveat that you buy the game at a sale price from Steam or another site (and then activate on Steam like I did). The game itself is truly fantastic, with 8 new characters, 16 returning characters, all characters getting 3 distinct fighting styles, Tons of unlockables, and (if you hate unlockables) you have the option to just buy all the unlockable content as DLC. The Kombat Pack is overpriced for only 4 characters, but you can find this at other sites on sale as well, which makes it more worth it, value-wise. It's too bad you have to buy Goro - which was a blatant moneygrab, as his content is visible ingame, but locked behind a pay wall.   The graphics are fantastic, the character design is equally fantastic, as well as the bakground arenas. The Krypt mode, where you roam an area and break tombstones to find unlockables, is an excellent minigame. The Socially networked practice 'King of the Hill' mode is a very fun way to learn the game, and the practice modes are all there from previous MK games. The Story Mode is great, but its attempts to give you an emotional story, with characters who care about each other, is a STARK contrast from MK's gameplay, which allows you to have these characters disembowel each other in gory, gory, GORY fashion. This makes the story mode and the rest of the game feel like disconnected Alternate Universes. Otherwise, the Story mode is a cinematic tour de force, with uneven voice acting, but awesome action sequences.  Get this Game, but get it on sale unless you are ok with paying $129.00 for all the content.",

It's like you suddenly expect your fan base to turn into a bunch of weeaboos where after I cut off someone's neck I can go big eyed and say 'ohhhh sooo kawaiiiiiiiiii' Seriously who wrote this story line ??? Has the person who approved this script toke soooo much that he thought this was totally appropriate to carry the legacy and the hype ???  The controls: Let's be honest... the controls are absolute garbage if you are playing with a keyboard x) The thing is, this isn't so with injustice, MK9 heck even with a winkawaks simulator playing street fighter and king of fighters, the controls work just fine.  What happened ??? Why did you add a delay to the combinations ?? All the button sequence inputs feel terrible to time now. ohhh it's fine if you have a controller but on a keyboard it feels sloppy and awkward and just not fun.  Honestly those 2 factors are a deal breaker for me. I personally look for storyline and gameplay in the video games I play. Mortal kombat doesn't offer either to me. It offers a degree of competitiveness, but I am not in that demographic of gamers.  This game made me sad and it taught me an important lesson.... *NEVER SHELL OUT 80$ FOR A PRE-ORDER*  Bad Idea^",

Growing up on the the Playstation 2, one of my favorite games was Mortal Kombat Deception. While I didn't enjoy the 3D fields that you would battle on, I absolutely LOVED the story mode. Travelling the 7 realms, for that time, was amazing. This is something that I would love to see in a future iteration of Mortal Kombat. While I understand that it is a way to introduce the new characters in a way that lets people grow to love or hate them, it just feels very boring and linear. Overall, the game is really good, and a fantastic buy if you have friends to play it with, otherwise, I would not buy it.",

Perhaps all of the negative reviews and reddit posts finally sunk in for WB. If so it means they responded about 4-6 months ago minimum. By giving them positive reviews now it hopefuly sends the message that PC is important ans we should be treated as such. If everyone keeps the negative reviews and just talks ♥♥♥♥ about the length of time it took they might just think hmm whats the point, all this extra work and they still don't care. I am of the mindset they deserve everysingle negative review and just about every negative word about this kind of buisness tactic. You don't just forget about your community unless it is on every itteration of your game. We all payed about the same so it is unfair and it can't possibly be that hard to port the updates over to PC. So i guess i think if anything they appear to have maybe learned their lesson. We will have to wait and see I guess. I still will be hesitent to pay for a season pass or to purchase a game where I believe the DLC is extremely important. Also Injustice 2 is going to drop here in the not to distant future and i think they wanted to wipe that dirty taste out of their customers mouths to prepare them for dropping another 59.99 on a very similar buisness model. I would have bought Injustice regardless because I am a comic nut and I couldn't possibly resist, but this does put a better taste in my mouth, perhaps RC instead of Fago, but this certainly doesn't make it Pepsi or Coke for me. Well thats my two cents. As for the game,THE GAME IS GREAT&gt; If you love MK than well its a no duh now that you get the whole thing. Below is my previous review, cut and pasted for comparison. ORIGINAL PRE OCT2016 Patch! I had reviewed this as a great game... It was, than the dev WARNER BROTHERS decided to stop updating the game, no new dlc unlike the consoles, this is total crap. I will never buy another Warner Bros game or product. People pay 59.99 for this and than you just stop supporting it fo just the PC. No alien, no leatherface.... not even updated netcode... BOOOOO.. Do your self a favor and NEVER buy another Warner Bros Product.",

The launch of Mortal Kombat X is quite possibly the worst launch of a game i've ever seen. Even disasters such as Day One: Gary's Incident would let you get passed the menu and into the actual game at least; Mortal Kombat X does not.   Basic features such as Online gameplay are actually disabled, urging the user to wait for a content patch that doesn't seem to be downloading, and even the features that are enabled (such as Single Match) cause the game to crash to desktop immediately.  Other reviewers of this game have stated that they will not change their negative rating until this is fixed. I think i'll do one better and say i'll never change it - fix or no fix - because this is no way to treat paying customers.  If you went to a restaurant and ordered a meal, only to receive an empty plate and a hefty cheque, with promises that your meal would eventually be delivered (maybe the next day, maybe the next week, or who knows when), would you let them get away with it?  And it's not even as if this is some early access alpha-level title from some obscure little game developer that's coding it all himself during off-hours from his day job. No, this is a Warner Brothers subsidiary company, ladies and gents. The millions of dollars that flow through their hands on a daily basis really should ensure a better situation than this.  I have to say I'll think twice before buying anything else from these people in the future, and I will most DEFINITELY not pre-order anything from them again, and I would be remiss not to advise you to do the same.  Oh. And don't even think about downloading the mobile version of this game. There is only more of this brand of frustration to be found there. ",

Sure the graphics are much nicer, but I feel like the whole gimmick behind this game is that you get LESS. In MK9 you selected a character and had access to all of their special moves and kombos, you just had to memorize them like any other fighting game. In MKX, you get to choose your character's fighting style, giving you access to (approximately) 1/3 of their move set. Why would I want to only be able to have access to a third of my moves at a time? Also kombat is much slower in this game compared to MK9. MK9 was fast-paced with kombos being key. Kombat in MKX is much slower, with clunky movement. It is much more important in MKX to focus on movement than your ability to kombo, taking a liking to the importance of footwork in boxing. That's cool and all, but that's just not the same vibe of previous Mortal Kombat games, and it just feels too slow to me.",

They called me a primate right to my face. I don't know why, I was just trying to play the new Mortal Kombat. I don't even know what that means. I think I unlocked hard mode because I actually got to adjust my settings one time before the screen went black. That's some pretty cool stuff. I used to do that in some older games. Except I remember doing some other stuff too. Some of 'em had stuff like playable characters and online capability, and you didn't even have to look for it! Oh well. It sucks we put stuff in the hands of the people who make the stuff nowadays... Although they do like to make people's spent money worthwhile to some of them and to themselves. Still waiting for that DLC content to come out guys, hope you add some more sliders to the display settings at the start of the game. Or was it the end?

So from that point of view, the game is completely playable.  Now to the game itself:  The game is a-m-a-z-i-n-g.  Super fun, the fighting mechanics are fantastic, and the graphics first class.  Also, there are many nice challenges to complete, and a place called the Krypt, which is where you unlock stuff using currency gained (it's like a minigame within the game).

I knew I loved this game since I first discovered Mortal Kombat back in 1993. This game surely does deliver and truly earns the right to be titled MK X. Everything in the storyline makes sense, but even more so to those that have followed the story from the beginning. Haven't spent money on video games like this in a long time and the idea of paying $60+ for a video game wouldn't cross my mind for a second for anything else other than this game. It's the only game I always buy new when a new one comes out and that's just because it's the only game that has been consistently well developed where you can tell it was an enormous effort to put together by a lot of really talented creative people. The only games I still enjoy playing as an adult now are the last couple of MK games that came out before this one. This one just takes it to another level with the cinematography and level of detail that visible. I'm sure there's a bunch of people that probably already got a list of things they don't like about this game, there's always people that find something wrong in everything.

The game's Fatalities, Xrays and cutscenes are all in 30fps, which isn't a big problem seeing as this is a fighting game, not a movie.

The gameplay is super smooth and the game is really fun. Online does not seem to be fully functional (at least for me) at this point but single player is as fun if not better than MK9 (story and tower challenges). The only issue I had with the game was that cut scenes and x-ray moves are capped at 30fps and thought it was a performance issue on my machine. I later read that this was an intentional development decision and after growing used to it the difference in FPS doesn’t hinder my immersion at all anymore.  I paid $63 for the Complete game with DLC and Goro and do not regret the purchase at all. If you can still get it at this price or less and if you think your PC can run it then I highly recommend it.",

I bought this game after the drop of support had already been announced, so I knew what I was getting into on that front. And once I got past that, I've been more than amazed by the game. I've been an MK fan since I was a teenager playing the original arcade cabinets, and this is easily up there with MK2 and MK9 as the best games in the franchise. Graphics and sound are excellent, the level of detail is ridiculous (just watch some of the stories play out in the backgrounds and you'll see what I mean), and the combat system is easy to pick up yet deep. It's a rare fighting game that both amateurs and hardcore players can excel at, and I much prefer the a la carte combat system in this game to one where I have to push eight buttons in a row or nothing happens.  Also - the living towers in this are genius. Just genius. Sometimes, if I have a few minutes but not enough to play a ton, I'll log on and see what the hourly tower is, play it, then go about my day.  I've logged almost 20 hours and I've only finished half the story and played with half the characters (only a few with all three forms). I've only truly mastered Kitana, and there are even a bunch of her moves/kombos that I haven't fully explored yet. I'm so excited to keep trying new things, and it's going to take me a long, wonderful time to get to it all. The amount of content is staggering.  So bottom line - if the abandonware issue is a deal-breaker, the don't get it and I won't blame you. But if you can live with it, this is truly one of the best fighting games I've played in forever, and it is worthy of the MK name.",

            "review_text": "Mortal Kombat X is a fighting game that I recommend everyone who enjoys fighting games to try out. If you are a longtime MK fan, then owning the game is a must. I had read review after review about MKX. I was on the fence about whether I should buy it or not. The complaints about lack of PC support and the lack of additional DLC were at the top of my mind. However, my strong appeal for the MK universe won out and I decided to purchase it. I purchased it for full price too, and several of the DLC that looked good to me. I was not disappointed at all.   The gameplay is fairly fast and brutal. If you make just a couple of mistakes, you do not survive the match. The combos are well done, with enough flow to keep the game moving, but not so much that they take up the entire focus of the game. Say, like in KIller Instinct. Great game, completely unrelated to this review, except that in KI, long strung out combos are the focus of the gameplay. In MKX, combos add to what you can do to the opponent, not your only method for winning.   You are free to experiment and implement your own combos with a mix of basic, half combos and special moves. The controls are well done and respond when you press them in the order you tell them to. I did not notice any lag or having to input my combos over and over again to get them to work.  Each character has a different feel and then within that, each character has 3 variations to choose from. Some variations work better for other people. Character choice feels like it is more of a matter of personal preference than anyone being too powerful. A couple of minor exceptions being Jason Vorhees and the Predator, two optional DLC characters. They feel a little over powered for my tastes, but they are still fun to play every now and then.  Graphics of course, are excellent. My only problem with anything graphical or gameplay wise is that my laptop must be plugged in to not have any slowdown. Killer Instinct is the same way, so I believe that my graphics card doesn't run at maximum settings until it is plugged in.  The pricing of the DLC is something that I'm not overly fond of. However, as I enjoy the game, I am more than happy to support the developers for their work and purchase any DLC that I find that adds to my game. The game was a full and complete game when I bought it. The roster was solid, in my opinion. I had no issues with it. When I found out that I could buy a few more characters to add to my game, I was more than happy to shell out a few more dollars to add them. I view the DlC as more like an expansion to the game. Not necessary, required or needed, but definitely appreciated and it adds to the game's lifespan.  Okay, I'll admit that I do not play online, so I cannot rate that aspect of the game. I found out a few years ago that I play like a mix between the CPU being put on hard/medium. I play decent, but am not great. Some players I found that I could crush beneath the weight of my boot. Others I wondered how what they were doing was even possible. I felt like they could read my mind. Throw me when I go to block, hit me high or low, opposite of what I was doing, and juggling me like a professional circus act. So, I don't feel the need to play complete strangers. The local multiplayer, though, is great. Grab an in-law or friend and sit down and beat the other person senseless. Maybe even perform a fatality just to rub it in that you won. So if you have anyone that you can play locally, this game is a great way to pass some time.  For being a fighting game, there seems to be a lot of content with it. The Faction Wars, which I haven't dealt with much yet, so I cannot say how much I like or dislike them. The krypt for unlocking in game costumes, fatalitiies and so on. The traditional arcade style tower mode to find out a specific characters ending that has no bearing on the actual story, but still fun. Living towers that change over time and have different tasks to complete and ways to fight. It all just adds to the game, making a standard 2D fighter a lot more interesting. The story mode is fun, fairly short unfortunately, but continues straight on from MK9. I actually like their reworked stories and how it is progressing. Bringing in children of longtime characters was interesting, but it worked well for me.   Overall, my experience with MKX has been a solid positive experience. The rosters are well rounded, gameplay is clean and tight, graphics are excellent. Fatalities just add to the fun as does local coop. Fans of fighting games should definitely pick this title up.",

They are complete and utterly computer illiterate. Long gone are the days of PC gamers that read system requirements or that can understand what they mean. This means a whole new generation of Intel HD onboard graphics 'PC gamers' are now leaving negative reviews on games they don't even meet the minimum requirements to use. You may be thinking 'No way, Warlord. You must be mistaken. It's the software it must not work'. Well, I'm sorry to break it to the glorious PC Master Race, but the only thing they master now days are obnoxious nerd rage threads about how much of a disaster zone their computers are blaming the developer for PEBCAK.  Game runs great. Have run on the game at minimum system requirements with an Intel i5 750 CPU and with a i7 4790k CPU. Above 60 frames with maxed graphical settings on both configuration. Optimization is great. Game runs like a dream and looks gorgeous.  It's amazing that this game is from the same developers that did Mortal Kombat 9 considering that was a truly bad port.   Don't be scared off by computer illiterates posting negative scores because it's 2015 and they still don't know how to use a computer. The game works. The game has worked fine since launch.  10 out of 10. Enjoy the Kombat! See you in-game.",

Server issues. Half the time I'm playing, I can't even connect to the servers or retrieve faction info because of errors with the servers. Not a huge complaint, but still unacceptable.  3. Many users have reported massive issues with FPS drops and lag, even in the single player modes.  4. A large number of players have reported losing ALL of their progress, including all their Krypt unlocks. To attempt to attone for this, these players were given 10,000 koins. To put this in context, the average cost for an unlock in the Krypt costs between 3,000-5,000 koins. I think the amount of koins they gave people to compensate their losses is absolutely insulting.  5. PC and PS4 are receiving DLC content a week after Xbox. Again, not a huge complaint, but this pisses me off.  6. Even the patches they've released so far to try and fix everything have ♥♥♥♥ed up, and had to be removed.  Now would be the time I would normally mention that I'll change my review if they get everything to working order, but no. Not this time.

Combine that with having several members of the same family as playable characters, and you get a pretty unsettling game.   I don´t know, something about seeing Jax rip his own teenage daughters head off and putting out his cigar in her exposed neck hole.. It kinda put me off in a big way.

At that point, I decided to uninstall the game and check back when the next character comes out to see if any real improvements have been made. So, I've stopped playing this game altogether only a month after its release.   Aside from the many technical issues, if I were to sum up my opinion of this game in one word it would be: underwhelmed. I particularly question the game's story mode. It's poorly-written and REPETITIVE. The same scenarios occur again and again. They took the concept for what should have been a 20 minute short and stretched it to 2.5 hours. It feels like there's very little material here. Aside from the initial introduction of new characters (which I enjoyed), there are no real surprises or twists. You just fight the already twice-beaten villain to save the world. Yawn. As a big fan of the MK universe and lore, this came across as very unimaginative and disappointing. Hopefully they'll move the series in a truly new and exciting direction with the next game.  I'll re-evaluate the game once all of the characters are released and the bugs are ironed out (who knows if/when that will happen). I would say pass on the PC version, and consider passing on the game altogether for a year until the inevitable GOTY edition comes out with the full roster and bug/optimization/balance fixes.

The game runs fine but every once in a blue moon the game hiccups think is more programing but its not an issue. But some performance patches would help that..The storyline is in line with Mortal Kombat but most people know they don't buy this game for just its story line it's an arcade fighter and its sublime with its graphics... I rate this game 9.1 But I have some suggestions to both players and the Devs... If you get this game I have one thing to suggest to you &amp; that's get yourself a xbox or PS4 designed controller their our thousands out their but I say xbox/ps because of the keys and feel... Anyways I think his game could be epic but their needs to have allot more unlockable characters and Idk about the storyline hell you threw Jason in the game bring back all the robots and all the others and let us just kil!!! :) really you will love the game it had a bad launch but I never had a problem I come with allot of back ground time in playing this game just want Nightwolf and others back in it with the new graphics :) and make it quick please!   Take care and have fun!",

With the story mode (around 4 hours), Krypt and towers there's plenty to do and all of it is worth a look.  Online sadly is the same as it's always been, Hit and Miss. Sometimes you get super laggy matches and other times it's really smooth. It feels like a lottery as the ping indicators give you no idea of the connection. It's a shame as there is so much to do here. If the online worked it would be amazing.  Now the problem with this game is not game itself but the terrible port by High Voltage. There are so many bugs, Fps drops and crashes that the game is a chore to play. I have a pretty decent system: R9-290 Xapor X, I7 4770K OC @ 4.4ghz and 16gb ram. This should easily be able to handle this game on ultra but even on the lowest settings I get frame drops and memory error crashes every time I play. Trust me, I have tried every fix I have read about and a few of my own but to no avail. When I have tried to contact someone about these bugs, Warner just don't reply and High Voltage say they were a 'WORK TO HIRE' company and can't help. So the company that ported the game (and it is a console port) can't and won't help as they were no more than hired guns to rush a pc port in whatever state. This is really bad as this probably means that game will never be fixed on the pc. I'm sure stuff like online and a few animation bugs will be fixed by Netherrealm but that's because they apply to console and PC.  It seems we just have to get use to a world where AAA games on PC are rushed out and then left in the terrible state they were released in. It's frustrating as I really like the game but cannot recommend this to anyone in it's current state.  BUY AT YOU OWN RISK         ",

The game runs for me at 60fps almost flawlessly, except for the cutscenes/fatalities and whatnot (which run at 30), but I can live with that. It also looks great and plays smoothly.  What I cannot live with, in the online play.  Both Ranked and unranked matchmaking only work about 10% of the time, and even then it's with constant re-queueing. Rather strange, since I would have thought ranked 1 vs. 1 would be the games most popular online mode. Apparently there's just nobody out there I can be matched with?  I had much more success fighting opponents by joining one of the 'Rooms', this system seems to work much better. You can challenge people within the room, or accept challenges from other people. However, this is also where the real issues begin.  Right from the second I get to the character selection screen upon accepting a challenge, there's a considerably noticable amount of input-lag. So much so that every 5 seconds or so, it won't actually register my button press to scroll across to the next character. In games this is just down-right unplayable. For a game that relies on a trigger finger to block incoming combo's, and then counter within the thin time-frame the game allows, this is just game breaking.  Before you say it, it's not my connection. I'm on a 50mb down and 25mb up wired connection. Even the game displays the maximum amount of 'green bars' for me. However, latency for all opponents (at least with-in one of the games 'Rooms') is always stuck loading, and never actually visible. Perhaps this is lag compensation, I thought, but I couldn't help feeling that all my opponents were having absolutely no problem pulling off intricate combos and blocking all my attacks. I felt like this was only on my end. I've also read plenty of reviews that state that the Online mode is the best yet, and the netcode is far improved over MK 9. So obviously, just isn't effecting everyone.  From there on it gets worse. Huge lags during character selection screens, fatalities, brutalities, you name it. Occasionally my gpu will stop responding altogether, causing a CTD. I'm using the latest driver recently released for GTA V, and everything else works flawlessly with it.  Netherrealm really need to get their ♥♥♥♥ together and fix this. I might try rolling back drivers, but in all honestly I don't see why I should, since everything else on my system is working fine. I'm also skeptical that it would do anything, since the single player modes work great without any input lag or slowdown whatsoever.  I wouldn't recommend picking this up just yet, unless you're only interested in the single player mode. For me Online is where the fun and longevitiy of this game lies, and right now, it's about as fun as being on the receiving end of most of the games fatalities.",

The visuals look great, the combat feels fluid, and the character designs (especially those of the women) are much better than MK9. The new characters are largely a good addition, although the military kids feel a bit bland at times. Like MK9, MKX has a great story mode (especially for a fighter) that lets you play as and get familiar with the new characters. While it's a bit short compared MK9, I still love to see story modes in my fighting games.  This edition of MK has seen a greatly improved version of the Krypt, which plays like a small spinoff of games like Legend of Grimrock. It contains a decent amount of collectables, although I'd like to see more 'making-of' clips along with funny unlockables like the classic 'Cooking With Scorpion.' Mortal Kombat also features more online-integrated features this time around, like the Faction War system and Living Towers. Sadly, the Faction War system has very little depth and ends up just being a method of unlocking more player card items. The Living Towers, however, offer reasons to boot up the game each week and see something new. There are premium weekly towers like those for certain characters or holidays, along with towers which refresh daily and hourly. This helps keep the game more fresh, although MKX is missing a large challenge tower like MK9 had.  While many people have had seemingly endless issues with the PC port, I've been largely unaffected. The launch itself was terrible due to the streaming download feature, but it ran decently well for me. Over the past couple months, the game has had several patches which have brought the quality of the port much closer to that of the console versions. I get a consistent 60 FPS while in combat, which is a great improvement from the regular slowdowns I had right after launch.  I don't really play the game online much, but that has been a major issue I've heard. Apparently fight connection could have been greatly improved, and now there are very few PC players left from the bad launch. It appears that another company has begun patching the game instead of High Voltage Studios, so hopefully the quality of the port only goes up from here. Unfortunately, many of the patches the consoles receive don't seem to come to the PC until the major DLC character releases, so balancing and bonus costumes have been delayed consistently.  Overall, I really enjoy the game. It looks great, plays well, and has good depth with the variation system. While certainly not perfect, I'd definitely recommend this game to lovers of Mortal Kombat or the fighting genre itself.",

            "review_text": "EDIT: Changed review to 'negative', seeing as Netherealm Studios and Warner Bros. have announced no plans to support this game any further despite being out for less than a year. DO NOT purchase this game, it is no longer being supported.  Mortal Kombat X is the 10th installment in the legendary fighting-game franchise, Mortal Kombat. Coming after Mortal Kombat 9, which undoubtedly delivers one of the best fighting-game experiences of all time, my expectations were pretty high. I was not disappointed; they've done it again! Mortal Kombat X is basically a reconfiguration of the traditional Mortal Kombat formula with a large host of tweaks and configurations. Firstly, the story mode; clocking in at about 6 hours, the campaign is significantly shorter than the previous game, and the character variety throughout is fairly limited. Most of the story mode focuses on the dull, new special forces characters as opposed to some of the more interesting characters. By far, the most interesting segments of the game have you fighting the civil war in Outworld as awesome characters such as Kotal Kahn and D'vorah. Unfortunately, the campaign is quite short and doesn't get as entertaining or substantial as the excellent story mode in MK9. With that said though, there are a lot of great moments and it was a great way to get familiar with many of the characters (many of Takeda's and Kung Jin's moments are pretty fantastic). Speaking of characters, this game includes 25 fighters (I think that's correct, but feel free to correct me), each with one with three variant fighting styles. An incredible amount of love and care has been put into designing these characters and their fighting styles, and I can honestly say not a single one of these characters feels underbaked or half formed. It is a shame that Goro, an iconic Mortal Kombat character, is locked behind a paywall (or free if you preordered). Once you finish the story mode, there's a wealth of other play modes to muck around in. You have single fight, which lets you choose your fighter/variant and face off against a number of fighters in a stage of your choice. You always have the excellent tower modes, including the awesome Living Tower mode, which lets you run through a list of opponents as a fighter of your choice while a random event will change the fight unexpectedly (for example, the 'sloth' sends orbs into the stage that force you into slow motion if they collide with your character). This was an excellent addition, as it helps vary the gameplay even after you've played for a considerable number of hours. There's plenty of content for offline-only players here, making Mortal Kombat X worth the price purely for the single-player content. The online modes are also a hell of a lot of fun, and remain pretty addictive after investing a significant amount of hours into the game. You can choose your Faction, meaning you and other players in the same Faction will earn XP towards their Faction goal, and the winning faction for that week will allocate Krypt coins to the members of the winning team. While the online modes are excellent fun and are very substantial, the netcode is currently rather shaky and players may have trouble connecting to and remaining in a stable online game. Hopefully further patches can improve this issue.  Overall, Mortal Kombat X is an excellent fighting game; the wealth of content and sheer polish put into this title makes it worthy of purchase for long-time newcomers and even for newcomers of the franchise. I've had an excellent time playing this, and I expect I will play it for many more hours in the future. Well worth the buy, and highly recommended!",

Of course they would give out DLCs to be able to earn a little more of grease to support the company's employees. The game is playable even without it and is still enjoyable.  Now, the graphics of the game looks stunning. A major improvement from the game's predecessor- Mortal Kombat 9/(2011). The character models are very detailed and captures their attitude and the astounding background scenery does not hurt my eyes.  The gameplay of the game is what you would expect from a Mortal Kombat game, not very fluent and smooth but quick and understandable. More kombos are available for the characters which makes me want to play all of them just to figure out and learn a few tricks that I can pull off online. Although this is not the first time a fighting game has interactions with it's background, I would like to praise how they place the interactions in such positions that you would seem to not be able to escape and just actually escape.The fatalities are not as entertaining as the past Mortal Kombat game though, some fatalities are very good but I get the feeling that most are missing something. The game is not laggy if you don't have graphics card from a few years ago so I'd recommend you get a new one this instant if you want to play the game,  Not much to say on the story mode of the game other than how the hell could a *MAJOR SPOILER ALERT* barbie defeat a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ wearing a jester's outfit whom became Ghostrider with horns?  Jokes aside, the game is truly fantastic combined with the gameplay and the first half of the story is close enough to almost masterpiece, that's probably why if I were to give this game a rating, it would be a 7/10.",

In my opinion, it's not as good as MK9, but it's a still a worthy MK title to own if you are a fan. The graphics and detailed gore are the best yet in this entry. It's a shame the story suffers with it's more soap opera plot and short length. Get it on sale, and hope everything downloads all at once. Regarldess of it's state, I had fun with it.  As of January 26, 2016: 'NetherRealm/WB has decided to abandon fixing the Netcodes, refused to support future DLC on PC, and they immorally decided to withhold this information to trick PC users...' The game has been working fine for me and many others since day one. But that isn't enough for NetherRealm Studios/WB, apparently. So no, I do not recommend this game anymore. I was really looking forward to Kombat Pack II, but alas. MKX is officially dead on PC now.",

            "review_text": "Fighting games aren't normally my sort of thing, I just can't seem to get into them enough to get good, but having played and thoroughly enjoyed NetherRealm Studio's last fighter (Injustice: Gods Among Us), I thought I'd give it a go as I've always liked the look of the Mortal Kombat series.  The story mode is as can be expected from a game of this type, essentially 4 hours of cutscenes interspersed between quick-time events and actual kombat.  Needless to say, the story hasn't exactly been the feature that has been bringing fans back time and time again, it's relatively dull in fact, but the characters and scenery are attractive enough to keep it interesting. There are a few chartacters I've had brief experience with from past MK games which are missing from the line-up, but I should think these are likely to be added as DLC further down the line. One feature that has been sure to bring fans back, is the gratuitous gore. This game had me wincing from disgust more frequently than I expected - which can only be a good thing as I've long considered myself desensitised from years of gaming. Kudos to NetherRealm Studios for that.  The way 'koins' are earnt throughout the various game types adds enjoyment to being able to unlock extras. Koins are spent in the Krypt, and all sorts of extras can be unlocked at random by exploring it. This is something I would have liked to have seen in Injustice as I'm more of a fan of the DC universe. Maybe next time.  The game wasn't without its share of bugs, none of which cause any real problems, but still annoying nevertheless. This coupled with a distinct lack of SLI support means this game has a little room for improvement. Both issues should have been resolved before release.  For a first foray into the world of Mortal Kombat, I greatly enjoyed the experience of MKX, and would recommend it to anyone looking for an entry to the series. However, I'd wait until it's a little cheaper as unless you're willing to invest a lot of time getting beaten to a pulp in the online multiplayer, the story mode just isn't long enough to justify the cost.  Edit: Netherrealm have ceased to support the PC version of MK X, meaning no more characters or content which will be released on consoles. Despicable behavior by Netherrealm and Warner Bro's.",

I was one of the best players on street, untill i found more hard players, which was more better in reaction and strategy of fight's. So that's life...there always a bigger fish, then you.  Several years later our neighbour got PS 1 and MK 4 on it (he also have other games, but MK 4 is all what I remember). I spend a lot playing that one on his console (at his home or he brought his console sometimes to my house and we played some sort of tournament between our street friends). Also I replayed numerous times MK Trilogy, which I still keep at my hard disc untill today.  Since 2009 I heard a rumours about MK Komplete and was happy when it finally get in PC. Without a doubt I buy 2 copies of the game for me and my brother. And even more I was glad about storyline and how it goes - I liked it more then story of Deadly Allience &amp; Armageddon, which I played on emulation (i am secret smoke human version fan, although his cyborg form was not bad).  And finally MK X get's in April of 2015. For two month I save money for preorder the Game.  Well there only one weird moment just for me in this new game: -New strange characters...I really don't understand why they brought here serial killer's and use childrens or descedant's of famous characters (which also have appereance in game) instead of remember old and forgotten characters.

All you have to ask yourself now...is it worth supporting the developer in the future with games like Injustice 2 coming to PC. Will they abandon us again, making us Double Dip again like most of us did buying the PS4 or X-Box ONE versions of XL. I'm not sure if i'm ready to roll the dice and take the risk again...but we will see. :D:  ORIGINAL REVIEW: Do not buy this unsupported, incomplete game. The game is no longer being updated, so if you try to play at tournament levels, the new tweaks, fighters and meta will become foreign.  The game is incredible...but as of today i am uninstalling it, and it pains me to say that.

I am running this game at max settings for EVERYTHING i can, and recording and have yet to fall below 58 FPS based on my Precision X logs at 3 hours of straight game play.   And for those that say this is a Main Menu Simulator, pay more attention in school, learn to read english, and you will see that the game has FYI message that it uses the Streaming Service that Steam offers.

My setup incudes a GTX 760 with 8GB RAM and a core i7 4770 which in itself should be quite adequate to play this title. The problem however lies in that the game gets many stuttering issues and screen tears on 1080p with everything besides antialiasing at max. I have to lower the resoution to 720p fir the game to run smooth. And yes, I tried lowering the graphics setting and keeping 1080p but even then the gameplay still suffered from screen tears and stuttering. Untill this game is propperly optimised I can't recomend this title in its current state. If you however don't mind loweing the resolution in-game to 720p it still looks outstanding and is a great fighting game, not not yet properly optimised for PC.",

PROS: Amazing graphics Great character roster, with 8 new characters Story is great. Probably one of the strong parts of the game Factions: This gives a new mode of the game for people all around teh world to compete on a team Tower mode allows for klassic mode, as well as new challenges like test your luck Player lobbies are a blast Fatalities are more violent than ever Brutalities are back!  CONS: Bad optimization, especially considering the last MK game seemed to be done pretty well Online mode is still kinda laggy. Be aware when joining games Game has framerate drops every so often. Kinda get annoying especially when precise timing is require to pull off combos Easy fatalty tokens as DLC? Seriously? Krypt in MK9 was much easier to use than the one in MKX  Overall, the game is still fun, and any fan of MK should pick this one up. I really wished it was better optimized, but if you have a good rig, this game shouldn't be any problem to run. I'd give it an 8/10, a 9/10 if it was optimized better  EDIT: 17 Hours later, I still can't play the entire game even after downloading all of the DLC packs for the game. Online is grayed out (or redded out) as well as the story, arcade mode, and still cannot play as Scorpion, Sub-Zero, or Shinnok (Seriously, those are the flagship characters of the game). I really hope somebody gives us some free DLC or a free game to make up for this disastrous launch.  I pre-ordered my copy of MKX through Bundle Stars so that I could get MK9 and this game for like 40% off retail. It was the first game I've ever pre-ordered for PC. What I didn't know is that this game was actually broken at launch. The first thing that I noticed was that when I started off the game, some of the options were faded out, and I could not choose them. It seemed off, but I didn't think of it that much. I then proceeded to Single Player, which the only options were training and single fight. I selected training mode, and the game closed. Restarted the game and chose single fight, game closed again. I then looked at the install size and noticed it was only 3.9GB, when it should have been about 30 GB. I had no idea why the file was so small until I found out the game only pre-loaded 10% of my game, where I can only play a few options while the rest of the game installed. I thought I bought a PC, not an Xbox One. The game is currently unplayable right now, and I'm kinda upset I wasted $45 on a game I can't even play.

This game is very addicting, especially when you're trying hard to master combos, beat the AI on Very Hard, beat really good players. The key to this game is technicality. The more you know about your character and your opponent, the better set you are.  Varying your moves and never being predictable are key factors to a good offense. To have a strong defense, look into you opponent's moveset, try to perceive any potential blind spots.  To counter, use the moves that can bypass your opponent. It takes practice to notice these things though.  If you're new to Mortal Kombat X, I would recommend that you don't play PVP unless you're able to beat Very Hard difficulty with you desired characters. That way you don't humiliate yourself when you fight other players.  The only complain is that this game is not worth this much money. I got it on sale, thank goodness. Never buy for full price. Look for deals. I'm still looking for bargain prices for the Kombat Pack. Still, a very good game that keeps you playing.  Get this game? If you're into fighter games, you must get it.",

I didn't have any trouble with the matchmaking, although I did get a bit of slow down on one occasion during each of my games (didn't stop me from getting my ♥♥♥ whipped). There's tonnes of challenges both 'on the disc' and set daily via online updates, as well as a story mode similar to MK9, and a number of variations on the classic tower mode. The game looks utterly fantastic as well, and is heads and shoulders about MK9 in terms of graphical fidelity.   However, and of course there's a however because GAMES THESE DAYS, there are a few issues. Firstly, whilst gameplay is 60fps all cutscenes, X-ray scenes and fatality scenes are 30fps, which is both jarring, and utterly baffling. Scratch that, it's utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I felt much better about it when I realised it wasn't my framerate dropping but it was built into the game, but it's still ridiculous that you cut from silky smooth 60fps during a fight, to performing an X-Ray move at half that, before the game skips back to 60 when the fight resumes. Why. WHY? 60fps was good enough for MK9, why not this one? And I swear to god if someone says 'it's cinematic' I'm gonna explode. What does that word mean? Because I'm pretty sure I don't notice films skipping frames, yet here with a side-by-side comparison built into the game it's hard not to miss, and harder not to be dumbfounded by the decision. Secondly, there is some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t costly DLC skins and characters. More insultingly, the characters are visible but blacked out on the character selection screen, taunting you with their presence. On top of that, you fight some of the DLC characters in game, which is an even more egregious way of dangling the carrot in front of you.   BUT, apart from these annoying design choices/business practices, the game is a great MK game. The fatalities are more brutal than ever, the loading screens are negligible, the different play styles for the characters open up a whole new world of personalisation for the players, and there is still a fair amount of unlockable content that one can gain access to through gameplay. I especially love that some of the fatalities are hidden, so you have to hop on the internet to find out what the codes are, or unlock them in game. It's not quite the same as having to buy a magazine or ask your friends, but the sentiment is there, and it feels much more like the kind of arcade MK experience that most fans of the originals remember so fondly.   I wasn't sure about this game for months, but apparently it's a lot better now that it used to be in terms of technical integrity, and I'm just loving playing it.",

I don't think this game is worth $60, especially since they ruined most of the character models and somewhat of the gameplay. You can use the stage itself to fight, literally. You can throw items and jump off walls and ♥♥♥♥, and it's kinda stupid lol. However, this game is fun to play, so I recommend it for those who care just for the gameplay. But for those who like being traditional and loyal to the MK series, DO NOT GET THIS GAME! IT'S A REAL HEART BREAKER LOL! Seriously, the story mode is cancer lmao I don't even wanna get into that b/c I'll run out of space to finish this review, so I think I'll just end it here. If you're gonna buy this game get it on ♥♥♥, because there is no reason why you should pay $60 for one of the worst MK games made by far lol.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

I will be trying out the beta for it later on and give my opinion of its current state. Until then, I still don't recommend this game at it's current price.  UPDATE 2: I tried the MKXL Public Beta and had a good time with it. Graphic fidelity had to be reduced somewhat to get a decent framerate online, but bearable. Gameplay was smooth and you could choose if you wanted to fight a found player based on network lag. Altogether decent. However, I don't know if this is true, but it's being said that Kombat Pack 2 is NOT included in this update and will require an additional transaction. I can understand this for new players as this was also the case on consoles, but I believe it should not be for people who: 1) purchased the game; 2) were lead to the conclusion that neither XL or KP2 would be available for PC; and 3) not notified in any way, shape or form until more than SIX MONTHS later that it would be available.  As MKXL (the netcode patch) will be available for free upon release for anyone with the main game, I can now recommend the game...but with caveats. Buying the game now, don't expect to get the Kombat Pack 2 stuff for free.",

Just face it that your rig blows and need to GTFO of the PC community and join the Console wars because you will never understand how a PC runs anything.

Now most common issue is people try these demanding games with a LAPTOP like WTF! GTFO!   This game is a step up and I am pleased to say the graphics and controls and added features such as easy Fatality was dope because I am all about new features. Also the choice of faction with added bonus of a Faction Kill is awesome as well. This game deserves all positive reviews and the DEVs keep up the great work and don't pay attention to the NOOBS that fail to realize how a computer works because you produced a masterpiece. Also thank you for adding Quick refrence with buttons and being able to choose fatality or kombos without having to always pause.  I am looking foward to purchasing additional content to show my loyalty to your work and haste with production.

When MKX came i knew it was a fantastic and fun game and still think the same .. I also have SFV and guess what with my friends this is the fighting game for us ... I was hating on WB for not releasing the KP2 for PC when they did for console ... I do have this game for XboXone but when i got it for the PC the game play felt 100 times better ... I have moved away from console for sometime tho not just from this game but others ... I most definitely recommened this for any fighting game fan ... if you like gore and violence this is the game ... untill they create another MK game that can top this ...",

Playing Online isn't as crashy or laggy as before, and both KP2/XL are available for everyone to purchase. Too bad a large chunk of their PC Community has left so it might be common to fight the same person a few times in a row, on Ranked. I hope this means that NRS or WB as a whole, will treat us to better launches, for their future Mortal Kombat PC releases.",

However, I find on the PC, it is easier to master the gameplay and more fun overall IMO. One thing I liked better on MK9 was the damage to your character was much more graphic and present than in MKX. In this MK the blood kind of looks bad and characters don't get parts of their flesh and skin removed for maximum bad ♥♥♥ effect like in MK9. Also the absence of some of the cooler characters (IMO) like Kabal, Wolf, Noob, Sektor, Jade and Smoke is kind of disappointing. I do like what they have done with the krypt and like the experience of walking in first person to unlock in game items. This is just me being picky, but I wish there was an option to uninstall the krypt portion, and story portion of the game (after they have both been completed of course) as the game takes up a lot of space, and it would be nice not to have any extra dead weight after I've beaten the story and unlocked everything. However, I am very happy with the fluidity of the gameplay and when the graphics look good, they look REALLY good. I only payed $4 so I will recommend it for sure at that price, but $20 is a little steep for the lack of cool characters from MK9, and bad player damage. If you don't mind these downsides and like the MK series then I can bet you will be very happy with this game.",
