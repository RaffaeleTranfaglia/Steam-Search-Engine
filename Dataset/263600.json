            "review_text": "  EF-12: Fighting Game Maker: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   Fighting games are usually fun but difficult to master. Learning and remembering each character’s moves (including the special ones) is always a challenge, to say the least. With EF-12: Fighting Game Maker and your own creativity, you will be able to design your own moves, settings and modelling. So, let’s jump into the EF-12 Game Maker arena and create your own fighting game!  EF-12: Fighting Game maker is a game engine where you can create your own fighting game. As you click on the application, you will be prompted to either launch the software or read the manual.   First I will start with the arcade mode available on EF-12: Fighting Game Maker. In this mode, you will have to select one of the thirteen characters available with the software (you can download further characters; make sure you check out all the guides from the game developer within the game steam store page). Once you have done so, you can jump into the fighting arena. You will notice a red circle on the floor - this is the confined space where the fight will take place. If you managed to kick your adversary beyond the red circle, he/she will be penalised by losing health on his/her life bar. But the same will happen to you if they manage to kick you out of the circle. You will win the fight by defeating your opponent twice; then you’ll move onto the next stage, and so on and so forth until you beat all combatants. Each fighter has his/her own moves, and you can learn them by accessing the manual which is located within the game files. If you want to have a quick fight, all you have to do is to select the single match mode.   Now for the creative minds out there who want to create a new epic fighting game - I strongly suggest checking out the guides available on the EF-12 Fighting Game Maker page. You’ll find plenty of information and downloads, too. Personally, I find it a little bit difficult to get my head around at this stage, but I can definitely see the potential if you take the time and put your mind to it.  The graphics and gameplay are decent.  Positives: ~~~~~~~~~  - Great additional guides and downloads provided by the Devs - Decent graphics and gameplay - Good price point   Negatives: ~~~~~~~~~~    - Takes time to learn  You can take this engine as far as you want.   7/10  Key provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.
