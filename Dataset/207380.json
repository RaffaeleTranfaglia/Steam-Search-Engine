            "review_text": "This game is amazing! To me, it's a combination of my old favorite vertical scrolling games like Touhou, Raiden, and Gradius (I know this ain't exactly vertical scrolling). On the hardest mode ever, it is still pretty punishing for me, but there is a storyline as you fight through levels and I know I will be playing this game a lot when I have the time to. If you are into the three games I mentioned above, this game is worth a try.  Bad parts of the game? Of course... -This game runs 30 fps but is intended to run 60! Running the game at 30 fps makes all the bullets move slowly... There are fixes to fix this issue permanently. Players will have to find a fix and apply it to the game so the game runs with bullets as intended.  Verdict: 9.5/10. Players should not have to go through the trouble to fix the game they just bought. Other than that, this game is very awesome.",

            "review_text": "eXceed 2nd - Vampire REX, the sequel to Gun Bullet Children, has everything that the 1st one lacked: Astonishing graphics, a soundtrack you'll want to own, and tight gameplay.  The game is story-wise a sequel to Gun Bullet Children, but this time you'll side with the vampires against the Church and their Gun Bullet Children. You play as Ria File, a half-human, half-vampire (aka a deviant bloodline). She has the ability to shift polarity: switch elements to absorb bullets of the same element while the other type becomes fatal. This is a mechanic that shouldn't be unknown to Ikaruga players. The game also has a dynamic difficulty implemented, whereas long survival and scoring gets you in a higher difficulty while playing, and dying reduces the difficulty. The overal difficulty of the game is okay. It might be tricky at first for newer people, but you'll get the hang of it quickly.  Although there isn't much to the story in most danmaku shooters, this one had a story i liked. The game references characters from the previous game as well. Just like the previous game, the characters have voicing in Japanese, and unlike Gun Bullet Children, this one has an official translation in the game.  The soundtrack was made by Saitama Saishu Heiki and Shibayan, well known names in the doujin world, and this soundtrack delivers, just like their other works. The boss music fits rather well with the bosses' personalities or significance in the story, whereas the stage music either takes it a bit easier or just gets really tense to prepare you for your next big challenge.  This game is just fantastic and is among my favourite danmaku shooters now. They really outdid Gun Bullet children by far. You can get it for 6 EUR, but i'd be willing to pay double price for this game.  Also, i didn't find the OST on Steam, but you can purchase it from the  tennen-sozai site  [tennen-sozai.bandcamp.com] .",

            "review_text": "Ikaruga presented differently. That means it's a polarity shooter, where you can change the color of yourself and absorb the same color bullets. The longer you do that the more your charge guage rises which will allow you to use a 'bomb' attack. As Ikaruga was one of my most memorable Shmups ever, this one will continue to be my favorite one of the eXceed series.",

            "review_text": "Very nice danmaku. I like the idea of the switching modes, when you chose what kind of bullets you are invincible for, i believe it's pretty novel. The sound is awesome. The graphics is reasonably good, though nothing special. IZI MODO is decent; there are enough lifes and credits to finish the game after a bit of learning. I am not sure I like the 'rank' system, when the game complexity increases if you do not lose life for a while, but I do not have any problems with that. The game might use some touhou-ish polish, indeed, but otherwise it is a very good, solid game. I'd give it may be 8.5/10.",

I like the polarity change feature, which is represented as a unique ability of the main char, and I like the idea of one character plot concentration, comparing to the original game. Take in mind, however, there is a ten tonne pile of animu girls in game. But that's ok, since I liek animu.",

Yes, you alternate between white (with blue outline) and black (with red outline) attack/absorption, charging up a super meter for mega attacks. Be warned, even on easy mode, this game is almost as difficult as Ikaruga was on hard mode. The story, voice acting and music are pretty mediocre, maybe on par with the Shikigami series, but clearly worse than Touhou or Deathsmiles.",

There are now more options and the game text is in English. Everything else is of about the same low quality of the first game. The developers also ripped off the main color changing mechanic from Ikaruga. The characters now have voice acting in Japanese, and for this game it means that you will hear five year old girls screaming or squirming at each other for dialogue. The bullets are still just balls and arrows. Half of them are black and the other half are red. The enemy designs continue not making any sense and can't be described as anything useful or interesting. The nonsensical story is pointless and its protagonists are stereotypical and redundant.  Why would anyone pay and play this ridiculously low quality Ikaruga clone when they could be playing Ikaruga itself? There is absolutely nothing redeeming or of value in this game. Capcom associating themselves with something this lame baffles me.  eXceed 2nd - Vampire REX is awful.",

            "review_text": "Truth be told, I've never been big on Shmups. Not that I ever really disliked the genre at all, but it was just never a genre that could hold my attention, and just looking at the games that are right in front of you, an American gamer had to do a little bit of digging to find some of the more interesting titles in the genre. Nevertheless, I've been into some of the fast-paced, 2d anime-style fighters like BlazBlue, Guilty Gear, and Persona 4 Arena, and through those circles, I finally got introduced to a few titles to look for and give a try. One series, which I see many people in the reviews mention, is Touhou, which I still haven't been able to play yet, but now am really looking forward to checking out.  The two which grabbed my attention like crazy were EspGaluda on PS2, and eXceed. After playing these, I can safely say I am not only highly enjoying these titles, but have learned how diverse, and fun this genre has become.  eXceed 2nd introduced 2 main concepts to me which blew my mind, and really hooked me in. The first is, naturally, the polarity system. I first saw this introduced in Ikaruga, and while it looked pretty cool, I never really completely appreciated how much strategy, and excitement that can bring to a Shmup. I honestly thought it would be too difficult for me to just pick up and play, but I actually picked up on this mechanic really quickly, and realized how I was actually getting better and better at it, the more I played.  The second is the system of building up special attacks, and being able to use them after a meter has been filled, thereby not limiting you to a set number of bombs, or waiting for items to drop on a stage. It seems like a simple mechanic, but just knowing that your own skill and ability can net you another big blast is comforting and rewarding. It's really amazing how a Shmup can have no gun power-ups, no bombs, and no items to watch for, and pick up, and yet still have a deep gameplay system where you need to have eyes on so many things constantly. Watch for your gage to max, watch for the enemy's life bar to be out, watch for the eXceed gage to bump you up a level, and watch for that next extra life to come in. Planning ahead for these critical moments makes all the the difference between failure and success, as well as bullet color and patterns to find the safest route to victory. In short, I highly recommend eXceed 2nd to anyone looking into a Bullet-Hell Shoot 'em Up, as it find a balance for all of the core mechanics to feel intense, but not overwhelming. And to those, like me, who may just be getting into this genre, this one is a great addition to expand on a budding collection.",

It feels awesome when it happens, then you die and it resets O.o Polarity switching, just like Ikaruga. Shotgunning. Bomb fills up fast if you eat a lot of bullets. Pretty colors. Decent voice acting (Japanese with English subs). Actually has a story which is completely skippable. Flowing sprite animations. Bosses have completely different feels which pull you in as you fight them. They aren't just random spaceships or monsters. Second to last boss is undescribably mindblowing and symphonic. Dance with the bullets or die.  So on, so forth.",
