            "review_text": "Cheap, nice rail shooter. Be the wild west hero you always wanted to be. Shoot the bad guys, spare the civilians, and save the hostages (by shooting at the lock or rope). Shoot crates to drop either coins (collect to buy upgrades in game) or bombs (which will cost you 1 life if you accidentally shoot at them). Coins can be used to buy upgrades like more hp, faster reload, larger magazine, and boosters. Simple to get into, has high replayability due to the upgrades and multiple modes are available, including time attack and zen mode. Highly recommended for fans of rail shooter and those who like to challenge their reflex. Not to forget, the soundtrack in-game is amazing!",
