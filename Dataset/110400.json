            "review_text": "inMomentum is one of those games that is a crebral feast of a platformer. Visually intensive as well as staggering in scale and scope. It makes you put every ounce of your capacity of lateral thinking into dancing and skipping across the massive, suspended maps in the fastest times possible, and punishes your dumb ♥♥♥ if you messed up a jump.  This is a GREAT game. But sadly.......inMomentum is a huge disappointment.  The game's trailer touts its 'Competitive First-Person Racing', 'Various Game Modes' with 'Over 30 Achievements'. But at time of writing the online multiplayer does not work, this in only one mode of play, and the achievements might as well as place holders because they have no funciton. Basically the game is not finished, and this almost throws me into a rage, because this is a FANTASTIC game, but if I can't play with other people Its nothing but a pointless time sink. I had bought this game with one steam friend specifically in mind who would go bananas for a game like this. But I can't play with them because the online is essentially broken.   So until the developer fixes it, inMomentum is an awesome, paid beta.",

There is a large focus on speed, as you are encouraged to blast though the levels as quick as possible; as you are only fighting a timer. Unfortunately, the game feels very clumsy. While I'm sure you could master it in time, any time I tried to pick up any speed or do anything interesting I would fall into a pit (the levels are made of very small platforms and 90% pits). The only way to complete the level is to slowly walk though it in order to be careful, which in turn becomes very boring.  Would not play again.",

It's very refreshing and addictive if you can get past the boring tutorial :P I'll be playing this one for a while.",

If there was a sequel to this game and the anti-cheat is powerful, I'd buy it. Lots of hackers there in the top 10 leaderboard, winning stages with impossible timings. Good game but weak security.  Edit: This game should have traps/anything to slow you down in the stages. Just a suggestion.",
