The music is calming since you're going to use your organizational skills to advance through it. I didn't have a problem at all running it on a Win 7 64bit single core laptop. So the requirements are pretty basic. Some secret mini-games are included which I've never seen in time mgmt. before which adds a fresh and innovative addition. Even if you can't find this on sale? It sure seems to be well worth the full retail with the 3 hours I've already invested. And most importantly? There are no negative reviews as my updated review. It tells you something for sure.",
