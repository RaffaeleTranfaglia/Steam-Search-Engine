            "review_text": "Redshift is a small publisher/developer from Hungary. Even though it's not released on Steam, their main major release was known as The Legacy. The Quest was initially planned to be the sequel to their freshman game, even its working title was The Legacy 2, even though that was scrapped in the end. The company has been around since as early as 2001, developing games for palm, pocket, and Symbian OC devices before switching to iOS in 2008.  Don't let that prior paragraph turn you off, The Quest is far from a 'cheap mobile port' even if it did originate on a smartphone operating system. This game feels every bit as solid and fun as any Sega Genesis, Super Nintendo, or old-school PC grid-based RPG, much akin to the Might &amp; Magic and Wizardry series', while keeping a very Doom, Wolfenstein: 3D, and Hexen engine. Keep in mind that unlike Grimrock Legend, The Quest is a turn-based grid movement RPG; the action does not happen in real time.  Within the story, you are a Kingdom Agent who knows little about their past. You've been sent on a special mission by King Mersant Orasare, and your task is to figure out what has happened to the governor of the Island of Freymore. The hitch is, you're not allowed to let anyone know who you truly are, or what your quest actually is; that is, unless they're a confidant for the King. However, it's going to be a while before you actually get on with what you were sent to Freymore to do, because everyone and their brother has a task waiting for you to help with; 57 quests, in fact, including the main ones.  The character creation part of The Quest is minimal but effective, offering a small, standard selection of classes much like any old-school game. These are the priest, thief, ranger, fighter, mage, and battlemage; there are also five different races to choose from, each of which will start you out at a different part of Freymore, and with different armor. At this time, I can definitely say that the battlemage is overpowered once you learn a good amount of quests, and if you choose the Rasvim race, which is an undead one, you will have access to even more spells to unleash upon your foes. Being a mage, or a ranger, also reduces the frustration that can come from the game when enemies choose to back away from you once their health has been reduced as you can hit them from a distance.  Although the character selection is small, the ways in which you customize your character is definitely not. Each time you level through gaining experience points, you are given a certain amount of points to put into attributes (strength, dexterity, intelligence, personality, and resistance) and skills, of which there are a multitude; dual wield, block, light and heavy weapons, light and heavy armor, mind magic, undead magic, protection magic, alchemy, stealth, disarm, and the list just goes on and on. As well, you can improve your skills outside of leveling by finding and/or buying books, then reading them. There are also books that are in the game just to add another immersive element, as you can read them for fun and they usually have nothing to do with the story at all.  Further customization elements include the massive selection of armor and weapons, which can either be bought in shops or found off of enemy drops, in dungeons, or as quest reward items. Each piece also has a 'fashion' rating, which can help your character in certain situations so that NPCs will respect and trust you more. Fame also plays a part in this, and you can gain fame by making virtuous choices and helping people, or loose fame by killing innocent people and making evil or selfish decisions. Some armor and weapons can only be equipped if you have a certain alignment, so once you choose your route you should stick to being either good or evil.  Much like older grid-based movement RPGs of yore, The Quest dumps you into an unknown land without any hand holding whatsoever... and hey, that's perfectly fine. You will spend large, copious amounts of time exploring the island and uncovering all sorts of dungeons, towns, buildings, people, and new areas. With that being said, there are also a lot of cryptic quests that take either luck, extreme old-school game smarts, or a guide to figure out; this means both solving the quest itself, or even getting to the point of starting one. Some NPCs and doors can only be accessed during certain times of the day, and some events will only be triggered if you have a certain skill to a specific level or above, With that said, there are also a decent amount of missions available that can be started by simply talking to people.  Towns are littered with citizens, all of whom you can converse with; although most of them will have the same script to feed you. It's only the NPCs that don a name, or shopkeepers, who will actually have something important to offer. A hefty 90% of the game is comprised of side-quests that have interesting little stories to them, some more memorable than others; such as one quest where you must exorcise a demon from a nun. The main story line missions are very few and far between, and even if you wanted to rush to do them, the difficulty level of the areas that they are present will prevent you from doing so. As such, the side-quests become less 'side' and more 'mandatory', as they offer not only the experience from killing monsters along the way, but sometimes spells, armor, weapons, and gold.  The world of Freymore is a beautiful one, that's filled with illustrious hand-drawn content. The foes that you will encounter are full of vibrant detail, and it's safe to say that they never become boring to lay your eyes upon. Many enemies have different incarnations based upon their toughness, for instance the Mugger will later become the Outlaw and the Highwayman the further that you progress through the island; to tell them apart, their color schemes are different, and this also goes for most of the enemies such as the Shaman, Elder Shaman, Archer, Expert Archer, and so forth. The environments are just as richly detailed, and even though you may start off in a wholesome area with green grass and fir trees, there's a poisonous swamp, foreboding dark woods, dreadful dungeons, water-filled temples, treacherous caverns, and gruesome gore filled chambers for the exploration. No two areas look even remotely similar, even though their inhabitants may be.  Not only do the visuals suck one in to a deep world of immersion, but the fantastic soundtrack is equally as captivating; even though the battle music stays the same throughout the entire game. Almost every area has a different, and long, song to be played, usually one that has a superior piano melody laid over a set of Sega Genesis styled chip-tunes. These two complimentary elements, along with fluid controls where the game can either be played solely with a mouse, keyboard, or even a combination of the two, as well as amazing optimization that saw my FPS sitting at 144 at all times, kept me playing this game for 9 hours straight. In fact, I didn't even realize what time it was when I finally stopped playing; it's been a very long time since I've been this deeply immersed in any video game.  I will say that my review has not done justice to The Quest, the game is far more in-depth than what I can even begin to put into words since Steam has a review cap. In all honesty, this is one of the best $10.99 CAD that I've ever had the pleasure of spending on a game. Redshift have put so much detail into this title, be it aesthetic or mechanic, and it's absolutely outstanding. Although my playtime shows 9 hours, I am only about 20 quests in to the game, with only about half of the map cleared. I cannot recommend or praise The Quest enough, it's a no-brainer purchase.   Rating:  5.0/5.0  - An astonishing achievement, this game must be played.",

            "review_text": "For me, the benchmark for that kind of game is M&amp;M X Legacy. The Quest, being indie game, is not nearly as polished. I played other games like that, e.g. Grimrock, but I never could play past 15 min. The story of The Quest looks strange at first, but I learned to enjoy it over time. Skills and items are all quite interesting as well, and excitment from visits shops doesn't wear off fast.  What's fresh here - it's old school progression system. Neither narrative nor regions decide for you when you qualify to go and fight. You do it the old fashion: you run, you train hard on weaker enemies, do quests, have a shopping spree, then you go back to the dungeon and kick ♥♥♥ of that spongy litte ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. And you save a lot, how else would you know when to run? There's nothing new in combat system, it's just ok (I find it quite underwhelming being an archer in games like that). Good-evil alignment is real and affects a lot of stuff including gear you can use. And, most importantly, what really keeps me going is exporation I think.  The game has its flaws, needs more graphics settings, could use more polish (UI), but if you are ok with that and if you can lay aside inconveniences like lack of quest tracking and quick bar for iteam/spells or accidental attacking of civilians then you will have a lot of fun with The Quest.",

            "review_text": "The Quest is pure, classic, RPG kino. It captures everything about what people love about old school RPGs, but excises the abhorrent user interfaces that makes a lot of them borderline unplayable. This game reinvigorates my feeling towards indies and makes me second guess my idea that all iPad games are complete and utter trash. (I seriously don't know how you'd play it on an iPad, but you can do it apparently.)  Yes, I absolutely recommend playing this at any price. Read on if you must.  The story is like, there's something about a governor and you being the chosen one - but that's not important. What is important is just exploring the world. Cause it really is about the journey, not the destination, and cause you're flying solo as opposed to the usual bore of a 4 party system found in these games, you have to pick up a lot of the slack. It reminds me of Fallout 1, where you have to be entirely self reliant - and just like Fallout 1, you can get yourself into a lot of sticky situations if you're walking off the beaten path.   Yet, that's really the fun of games like this. To be given an open world and the developers giving you overpowered spells or weapons in little trickles here and there, to give you that necessary boost to just barely endure far more difficult areas you shouldn't be in. The Quest has you become a multiclasser in a way that most games WISH it could do as gracefully and naturally, because it's about your moment to moment survival and doing what makes sense, rather than adhering to strict, nonsensical class rules.  'The Quest' as generic as it is, is an apt name. Wandering out in the middle of nowhere? Maybe you'll find some guy in a house that wants something in exchange for gold. Or maybe they'll do something nefarious to you. Maybe they'll just give you a potion for no reason. Whatever it is, the game has a really good pace about what you'll find, who you'll find and where you'll find it, and stumbling in and out of sub quests is really exciting, cause you never know when you're gonna find one. You gotta keep mental notes about useless areas and useful ones, and occasionally use a leap in logic to resolve a situation. I recommend you never use a guide outside of moments where you're completely stuck. (For the record I used a guide twice.)  The turn based combat is what you'll be doing the most of, and it can be an almost unwinnable slog at points depending on your build and how you integrate your items. The combat strategies sometimes go back to classic Diablo and potion management, others are a careful use of appropriate spells or plinking your target from far away. Sometimes you can find yourself in a advantageous position where your enemies can't even get to you, and that's always satisfying. It all adds up though for those late night endurance runs in a dungeon, where you're not sure if you prepared enough but want to just keep going, even if you have to make save scumming a part time job.  Besides questing and combat, the other main component is self management. Your items will breakdown - a lot, and there's not much you can do. You can pay for repairs or use repair hammers. To give you an idea, just  walking  will break your boots. The starting leather boots for example broke after walking about 1,000 grid tile moves and I would just carry replacements, because repairing them was pointless as they didn't add much defense anyway. It can be a real pain when you're traversing a dungeon and having gone through several levels, the sword you're using starts doing negative numbers in damage because of how broken it is. Then there's the matter of food and water that you need for resting outside the city. If reading that whet your appetite, then you know what you're in for.  Is the writing at least good if you think you can handle the brutal mechanics? God no. The translation can even be subpar here and there, but it mostly makes sense and works. You get the general gist of everything with the usual archetypes found in both characters and lore, but the important thing is that there's hints of inspired quest design and sensible reasons as to why you're doing something. It has the surface level fundamentals needed for a good dungeon crawler. Serviceable and cheesy, but never bad.  The graphics should at least get a passing mention, as it features a eyepoppingly catching art style that was one of the reasons I wanted to play this game in the first place. It's exactly like how I'd imagine a company would do a proper HD remake of a classic from that era, whether it be Might &amp; Magic or Wizardry. It nails the look without going for a kitsche retro pixel feel and I have to salute them for it.  As far as big negatives go, this is surprisingly one of the few RPGs where being a thief character is nearly useless. As you can't rapidly pawn items, pick pocketing nets few rewards and lockpicking is out and out useless, as doors seem hardcoded to only open to keys. It's more likely you'll disarm a doors trap than actually be able to open it up. I don't get why this was done, but if you're of the roguish persuasion, you might want to doublecheck what skills you make important.  It's not a perfect game, and it commits many a sin, but it's just so mechanically well done that it kept me up in the wee hours in a way I thought only a multiplayer game could. I understand not everybody can go for this type of RPG - especially if they can't sink time into an RPG like they used to - and they might prefer something more linear like the Witcher series, but if the idea of seeing more and more open road excites you at the prospects of what's to come your way, then you really should play this and carve out your own story and experience.  The Pro's:  +Great RPG design and gameplay  +Stellar graphical presentation  +Never holds your hand  The Con's:  -Combat can sometimes be a slog  -Some bad design quirks (Lockpicking is useless)  -The story and characters aren't exactly the best  -Not enough portraits ",

            "review_text": "Played about 80 hours with two different charakters and had a lot fun so far! Still not done with the expansion...  The game heavily reminds me of my old favourites like Might &amp; Magic (especially before the change of universe), Elderscrolls (up till Morrowind) and even Arx Fatalis or Stonekeep. Though one should not await a game like the named ones, the quest is much shorter - but still long enough for it's price. The story is a well enough done fantasy stereotype one in an usual fantasy world, not that much dialogue, but a good chunk of quests - also some that can be solved in different ways. Very nice indeed is the fact that your reputation as well as your appearance influence how npcs react and how some quests work out. I would like more of that stuff!  Usually I care not much about different races or classes, but about the freedom to build my character in a way i do like without to much restrictions. This game lets you do both ways: If you do not care much about tinkering around your charakters build, use one of the pre-defined classes (all the fantasy rpg stereotypes are there) - but if you like to brew your own stuff, that works pretty nice, too. The races do not play very different in my opinion except for the undead. Your class choices (or skill choices) weigh much heavier. I tried different charakter builds and it seems a warrior type plays a lot easier than a mage type...  About skills: The game's skill system is pretty sophisticated both in the way skills are executed and how you level up. Three different weapon types (ranged, heavy and light) to combine with dual wield or shields, as well as light and heavy armour. The thieves skills I did not use as much - most can be duplicated by spells and you do not need lockpick and disarm or pickpocket that much overall. The magic schools are fine, though I did not find much use for mind magic, except in two or three quests where it came in really handy. I really liked the Environmental School/Enchanting and Alchemy - nice clone of Morrowind (which had the best so far imo). Your skills' max rank is based on the 5 attributes. Level up is standard rpg - get enough xp and you get a level, which means points for attributes and skills. Leveling up needs a lot of xp soon, so a bit of specialisation is in order. But since there are a lot skill trainers around and money is not much of an issue you get all skills to a decent level to use in quests, where they are sometimes checked.  Up to now I did not encounter any bug and only two crashes, which I deem a very good ratio.  Now the least important part about a video game - graphics and sound. Sound is fine, could use a bit more different tracks. The screams of dying outlaws are hilarious! Some people seem to complain about lack of animations, there really is not that much but for me that is no problem at all, since the hand-drawn graphics make totally up for that. It feels like the devs took the old rpgs pixelblurr and remade them in shiny HD-gems. I really love the Cyclops - looks just like the one in the old Sinbad the Sailor movies! The only drop of bitterness here: Not that much monsters and npcs (that is different drawings) in the base game and only a handful more in the expansion.  Okay, lot of blurb...  All in all it is a really good game and it has a lot of potential for expansions (as you can see with it's mobile versions), especially if the developers release an editor (which is planned as far as I know). And I think the devs / game / engine could do lot more - maybe with The Quest 2?  Edit: Nominated for Steam Awards - you guys have earned it!",

I played through both The Quest and the expansion; Islands of Ice and Fire, and I really enjoyed playing through them both. The game itself is alot of fun. Alot of sidequests, really gives the nostalgic turn-based dungeon crawler feel.
