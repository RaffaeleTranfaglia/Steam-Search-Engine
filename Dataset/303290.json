            "review_text": "I really enjoyed OZMAFIA!!, despite the fact that you have to shout the name. With so many characters to choose from, and 2-4 endings each (none of which are technically 'bad'), there's enough story there to more than justify the cost.  That said, I wouldn't recommend this game to everyone. There's plenty of violence and blood all throughout, and while it's mostly written and not really gory there are some bloody sprites, and CGs that might make people uncomfortable. The True Ending is also exceptionally violent, even considering the rest of the game.  There are also two drugging scenes, and another scene that was likely the result of a drugging. There's implied ♥♥♥♥, prostitution, and one of the routes made me seriously uncomfortable. But that's only in two routes out of about ten, both of which are easy to avoid. You're warned away repeatedly in one, and here's a tip to avoid the other without spoiling too much: leave the married guy alone.  But with ten routes (thirteen if you count the secondary routes for the three Ozes) there's bound to be something you'll enjoy. There're a couple star-crossed loves, an adorable friendship, and an entertainingly sarcastic jerk. Or the brothel, if you're into that; just because I disliked it doesn't mean that you will. There are some really funny moments, and while the main character isn't very bright, she's almost always enjoying herself.  Overall I had fun with it, and unless you’re really bothered by the things I mentioned earlier I think you will, too.",

            "review_text": "The game deals with some pretty dark themes (there's drugging in one/two routes, for example) and can get quite gory in terms of description (not visually though) when fights happen. So if you're someone who's looking for a PG-rated game, you might not enjoy all 9 routes. If your mind is open, please buy Ozmafia! It's a pretty decent otome. :D  + Reasonable price for the amount of time you'll spend on this game (9 routes, at least 2 endings each) + Some endings/stories are bittersweet, which I personally feel enhances the story and make me care for the characters more (I mean, if you've played Hakuouki, aka everyone you love will die, you will understand what I mean) + Nice art, fits the atmosphere and 'fairy tales/fables' influence of the game + Pleasant sound track and the OP is pretty catchy! + Translations try to retain the feel/meaning of the original text; instead of just translating 'ojousan/ojouchan' as 'young lady', Caramia (of the Italian-influenced Oz family) uses the Italian term 'signorina' while Hamelin (Pied Piper of German origin) uses the German term 'fräulein'; it adds to the narrative as well as give the characters more personality + Good voice acting, even if the VAs are not big names; I would LOVE to see more work from them in the future + Funny banter and good chemistry between the characters + Pretty impressive world building, and you gradually find out more about the world as you complete each route, leading to the Grand Finale/Epilogue  -/+ It being only 70% voiced can be a little distracting, but it's easy to get used to after a while -/+ Repetitive text in some parts of the story, but you can skip through them to get to the fresh/new stuff -/+ No 'romance indicator' to let you know if you're making the right choices, but easily solved with a walkthrough -/+ Loading screen pops up as transition between scenes and it can get pretty annoying  - THE BROTHEL ROUTE is uncomfortable to play (could be personal opinion though); if you are wary about it, try playing it in the middle or at the start so that the other routes can act as a palate cleanser! - Same thing with Robin Hood's route; it can get uncomfortable for some people... - If you like to figure out the answers yourself, not having a 'romance indicator' can be a pain",

            "review_text": "This game is huge emotional rollercoaster. One route's both endings made me cry like I had lost someone very close to me. I was shaking and cried and cried and couldn't believe what I saw and read. I still don't want to belive it.  Every route is different. Every route makes you feel different feeling. This game was the first one to make me feel so many different feelings from every character, I haven't still completed all the routes but I believe that the rest of them will make me feel different feelings with every character too.  The game's not always dancing with roses, and I like that. Eventhough sometimes (sensitive that I am) it shocks me.  I have to take a break from the game for some days (don't know yet how many) because one of the routes broke my heart, I can't understand the endings. And I want to understand them, I hope epilogue will make some sense for it. And maybe other routes could too? This game's world is so massive, every route you learn something new or get new questions without answers yet. It's a game you have to finish.  Anyway plus things:  + every character is different you dont get same same kind of experience in every route eventhough the main story remains the same (as long as you get to your chosen route it changes its perspective and some other things too) + art is really pretty, it makes you feel calm. + the music is beautiful too, and there's fitting music for every situation. + there is skip button for things you have already seen (but you must pause it in right time because it doesent stop skipping when there comes new things you havent seen yet) + it's voiced (though its not fully voiced because apparently after they had made the game (voicing and stuff), they added new senctences here and there - made the conversations longer so its understandable but in the ps vita version its fully voiced and theres extra cgs too) + its about mafia famiglias so there's fighting and other sorts of things so you cant know whats gonna happen next for the heroine's life (also i like action things) + there's friendship route with cat lady + there's person for everyones taste (how they look and behave and so on) + 10?? routes (if I calculated right) and over 20+ endings (famiglia oz has 4 different endings for each character if I remember right) so there's much gaming! + you can name the heroine yourself or then u can let game decide your name and then it will be Fuka and if you choose it they will call your name with voice + play once a route and you get second time playing the same route extra scenes about the chosen character's point of view and other 'behind the scenes' things + you can hide the heroine's picture if you want to concentrate more to it without the lady Fuka + heroine's understandable person for being amnesiac and she's not silent but curious and positive thinker (but also acts before thinks too quite often)    minus things:  - no route for Hansel ;_; - full screen's not so sharp, it doesen't look so beutiful like windowed - you cant take screenshot (unless you take 'normal' screenshot with printscreen button and put it manually to steam's screenshots folder) - unanswered question which make you feel sad because you want to understand but they dont give you the opportunity to it --&gt; 'its just like that we let it be mystery for you' nope, i want to know whats going on!!111 why did this happen??? - not telling properly about character pasts and motives here and there - the character named Manboy.. He's name disturbs me too much. Can't help it. But I've come to accept it at some point I think? - there's no achievements so you cant be sure which endings you have already completed (plus achivements are fun so its a bit sad thing) - I wouldn't have minded if the routes would have been somewhat longer, it felt like everything ended too fast. I wasn't prepared to it. And maybe that's one of the reasons which made my heart cry too in some routes. - I'd wish the skip would stop when there comes a scene you have never before seen.  //Anyway, thats what I think and I haven't completed it fully yet so I may maybe maybe add some things here when I've done it. :^) Also this is my first review but I think this deserves my opinion here, because when I was thinking should I buy this there were so much negative reviews. And this is not bad game, it's quite good eventhough it's not your usual otomegame.",

One thing I could say I probably didn't like is that on some scenes where the character was injured or unwell, yet during their dialogues they were shown standing looking no different than normal just with additions of few tinges of red on their clothes as if to represent their injury.  I feel it would have been better if they actually have a separate CG scene for those situations. Kinda just feels weird otherwise.",

OZMAFIA!! set my expectations ridiculously high and it only delivered on art, SFX detail, and maybe characters. As far as the Heroine/Protag/You[us] goes, it is probably what prevents me from completing any more routes on this game. While OZMAFIA!! has some nice customization options for immersion, I wish there were options for how incredibly oblivious, unintelligible and WTF you can make the Protag. I understand the Protag has amnesia, I totally get it. But by the gods her character is so unacceptable. [insert “I’ve played a lot of otomes in my time and this has one of the worst protags ever” remark here].   Also the loading screen that occurs throughout the game with the musical jingle was precious at first...however it becomes very tiresome and it honestly breaks immersion for me.    Initially I was going to give this game a recommended review but after a lot of thought, I honestly can say I would not recommend this game.  ",

            "review_text": "I’ve played a fair number of otome games, so when I saw that this was available on Steam I was really looking forward to playing it. Unfortunately this was probably one of the biggest let downs I’ve experienced in gaming. The art is so beautiful but there’s just- nothing! Nothing of substance in the plot, characters or writing. There's also no sense of atmosphere or even investment. The characters are just cardboard cutouts (it also doesn’t help that the designs are eerily similar to the Diabolik Lovers ones – Axel = Ruki, Scarlet = Kanato, Kyrie = Laito etc) and yes they talk a bunch of exposition and backstory to you but it just falls flat.  I don’t feel like I know these people, or that they could genuinely care and love Fuka (She’s a blank slate! But the story sure demands that they love her) and you can practically feel yourself being manipulated by the game. It tries to pull the right strings by repeating tropes often found in otome and romance games, but the difference here is that you’re hyper aware of it. Where other games mask this by creating investing plots, engaging characters and scenes that stir your heart, Ozmafia will have you rolling your eyes and yawning.   Fuka has no personality and is basically a doll to smile and look pretty. She says insensitive things that can be passed off because – lol she’s so naive, isn’t it quirky!   *Sigh* I really wanted to like this game, I really did. I tried to turn my brain off and just enjoy the dialogue, nice voice actors, and pretty art if there was no plot, but nothing made me want to keep playing. I wanted to support more otome games since many titles have yet to be translated that deserve attention, but buying this game is not worth your time or money.  ",

The music sounded cute, the art was absolutely stunning and the story seemed really awesome! Fairytales and a dating sim? Heck yeah I'm down for this! So I bought it the day it came out.  .. and refunded it about 2 hours later. I want to like it, I honestly do. But there is just so much about that either doesn't sit well for me or I just simply hate and with a price tag of over $30 I just can't justify buying a game I'm not in love with.  Some problems I had included very minor things like spelling mistakes, the default name being said which was rather jarring, the third person perspective was okay at first but I felt so disconnected from the Protagonist that I couldn't get as interested in the story as I'd liked, and around the 2 hour mark my game wouldn't stop lagging, which really surprised me.  But the most jarring thing? The actual romance. After refunding the game I looked up a quick summary/review to see what I was going to be missing out on and holy-! The amount of NTR in this game is awful, and some of it is impossible to avoid, which really didn't sit well with me.   Again, this is my own opinion and don't let this stop you from purchasing it. Am I glad I refunded it? Yes. Completely. Would I purchase this again in the future? Honestly, yes. But for now the price and the uncomfortable romances have turned me off.",

Honestly I've never encountered a otome game with so many choices before (especially the triangle relationship) so it's a nice change of pace for a game of this genre. I absolutely love the character art (one of the main reasons I was attracted) and while not the entire game is voiced I at least like how important conversations are voiced; personally for me when it comes to visual novels I do like to read a lot while the voicing is an added bonus! Despite what people may say about this game and/or otherwise if your a true otome gamer you have to give this game a try and enjoy it like the rest of us :D",

The art and character designs are gorgeous, some of the best I have seen and the use of softer colors is highly fitting for it. The story from what I have read so far is actually quite good, even though I chose to focus solely on Caramia for my first playthrough I still found out a good amount about the world and the other members of Famiglia Oz and all of the other characters. For the most part it's pretty easy to choose the right options to get on the route you want to go down, which is a nice change of pace from some of the other VN I have played that make it harder. I was a bit put off from buying the game initially due to the fairly large price tag, but it seems that this game is long enough to more than justify the price tag.   Pros: -Gorgeous art -Just about every character is entertaining -Interesting plot -Good setting -Bishounen -Good heroine  Cons: -Putting it in full screen actually make the sprites look somewhat worse. -Not every line is voiced -???  Overall I would say that this is a fantastic VN and well worth the time of just about anyone, assuming they are levelheaded enough to not be sickened by trying to romance the men, or the single female romantic option, as a female lead.

This is NOT a mobile port, so it is actually high quality and the art is beautiful and it never has 'derpy' looking CGs, only beautiful CGs. The music is very nice, and really adds to the emotions that you will feel while reading, and I think they did great timing it to the situations.  You can choose volume options for voices, so if you are like me and HATE high-pitched squealy falsetto anime girl voices, you can disable your own voice and the loli girl's voice.   If you plan to watch the anime, another one of my reasons you should get this game first, is because like almost any otome anime-adaptations, the anime will most definitely feature her super high-pitched voice and her acting like a stupid doormat (you can make smarter choices in the game), and probably will skim through some routes without the deep emotional involvement, and for sure you will not enjoy the anime as much as the game.  My only complaint with the game is that Caeser's route is short and kind of linear compared to the main 3 guys, but somehow, I liked it a LOT better. I've only played Caeser's and Axel's route so far, but I much preferred Caeser's.  Axel's route started cute, but became more and more anticlimactic as it ended... It's just my own opinion though.  I highly recommend Caeser if you like beautiful Kuudere-type guys(characters that start off cold/anti-social but warm up to you gradually). He also has a beautiful uniform in one ending (my favorite ending so far). His route overall had a little bit of a 'Beauty and the Beast' feel to it, it was sweet.  On the other hand, if you do like the main 3 guys, you will have a great time because their routes are really long and have many alternative paths.  If you play any route a second time after finishing, you also can see the guy's perspective kind of like a behind the scenes thing.  Overall, if you like fantasy-themes and Otome visual novels, definitely consider this.",
