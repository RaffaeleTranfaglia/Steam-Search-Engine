            "review_text": "  Black &amp; White Bushido  is a fun little four player versus game that has a great novelty of really making you feel like a ninja through use of camoflauge.  My regular  TowerFall  group gave it the thumb's-up (which they rarely like anything but the usual). Its certainly smaller in scale, but has enough fun for a couple of gatherings. Overall, I do wish there was more content, though.   The coolest thing about this game is its novelty; you first choose either a black or white ninja, which allows you to blend in really well with like color.  This adds in some nice strategy where you can just sit still and wait for the kill. Its reminiscent of getting the mirror item in  TowerFall . Really makes you feel like a ninja.   Pros:  +Awesome use of the black and white camoflauge to make you feel like a boss with those stealth kills +The whole level is on the screen at one time (like  TowerFall  and unlike  Duck Game ) - the moving camera in other games can bother some gamers with it constant zooming-in-and-out   Cons:  -Content is slim; only a handful of levels (like 5 or 6), and two game modes (deathmatch and capture the flag) -Music and sound effects are nothing to write home about -Needs more weapons and consumables   Get it on sale, if you are into local play.
