            "review_text": "I joined this game during the kickstarter, and ended up being involved in the beta testing process (albeit, only having really played it once, with a bit more time added to boot it up repeatedly to show my friends).  If you're a lover of old school adventure games like myself, I reckon you will love this indie title. It's a meta slap stickish adventure with gags that work on multiple levels. I literally laughed all the way through, constantly sending the devs what I thought were some of the funniest lines I'd seen in a game lately (it made them extremely uncomfortable, it was great).   My biggest issue usually with some adventure games is the lack of logic in some puzzles - resorting to the classic 'try everything with everything until you figure it the hell out.' I never really had to do that with this game as most of the puzzles make sense and are fun to figure out rather than brain melting.   So if you're looking for a laugh filled fun puzzling adventure, look no further! Her Majesty's SPIFFING has arrived :P  I want to see a HMS part 2 pls.",

            "review_text": "This is a nice little game that you can sit down and play with your kids, but I would absolutely not buy it for just myself - after having played it for about 2 hours.  Before going any further, I will say that I have completed my Let's Play for it, and it's available on YouTube in the form of a Let's Play/Walkthrough (it's hard to not give the game away while playing it!). You can check that out here:   Her Majesty's SPIFFING Walkthrough   So, I'll start with the negatives first since they're the detractors. My biggest problem is that all of the puzzles are trivially easy, and just require a bit of dumb luck in determining if what you're doing is the right thing, or the wrong thing. They don't naturally make sense all of the time, and are built around a bit of cartoony and childish solutions. That being said, it's FINE! I just personally wasn't expecting it.  The other thing that I didn't like was the amount of back-and-forth required to do some seemingly minor things, or to check and see if what you did was the right thing. Sometimes I just wasn't sure what the next step was or if I was even on the right track. There's no indicator besides disappearing items as to whether or not what you're doing is the right thing. That's ok, too!  Not a bad list of things to NOT like, but the things I DO like definitely overrides that! The humor really stands out as a success. They continually poke fun at their own genre and 'lack' of writers, if you will. They poke fun of the game, from within the game. In true British form, the humor was dry and subtle, but sure to put a smile on your face!  The graphics were surprisingly on point! I loved them, despite the seemingly low budget nature of the project! They fit well, and made me feel good just playing the game. I wasn't sacrificing any quality in that department just to enjoy some crappy jokes.  Speaking of jokes: As a warning, some of the jokes lean a little outside of the G-Rated realm I expected. Not that they are inherently adult, but if you are old enough to get the adult natured jokes, you will! That's for sure!  In summary, if you have a bottle of cheap wine and got this game through Kickstarter or on discount, you'll probably love it! The old school point and click nature of it make it an at your own pace comic relief after a long day. Try not to play it all the way through in one sitting, but you might do it on accident! And for some reason, I hope there's a sequel! ",

            "review_text": "Very short game, only a couple of hours long. However, being an expat from the UK, I found it very enjoyable and it brought back quite a few memories of being back in the empire :-)   Some of the gadgets you come across in the game are definitely reminiscent, especially going back a few years :)  Recommended purchase if you are into point and click story games and enjoy a little bit of banter between the   British   and the   French   cultures.  I don't often post reviews about the games I purchase but if this helps the team develop a longer version of this game then I'm all for it ... so what are you waiting for ... go buy it so they can :D  If you need any more of an incentive, the controller support is spot on so it's very easy to play from the comfort of the couch in front of the TV.",
