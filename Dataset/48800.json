            "review_text": "This game has great trailers, it does look amazing.  What it does fail to deliver is a good game, it plain sucks. The damage model of the ships is super basic, it clips through whatever you crash into, there's no visible damage.  You can walk on your boat, a great feature, but you can't jump, you can't open doors, those few boats that do allow for moving around on them usually have closed doors that you just walk through, like a ghost.  When a ship sinks, the water just clips through everything, I realize this is not really an easy thing to code, but it's as if you played GTA vice city, perhaps that looks beter still.  When a boat is going fast through the water, the water does look extremely good, but the disturbed water 'animation' slows down' when you go slower, doesn't look good when you know that.  I can barely play this at all anyway, I have a pretty beast game PC, (60FPS in most games) but here I can barely scrape 20 at times, due to the fact that the developer has not patched the issue of AMD videocards not really being optimized for this game.  If you have an NVIDIA videocard, you'll not have this issue, if you have an AMD card, don't bother buying this game, it'll not run playable.   Good game? The idea is good, but it's poorly performed.",

            "review_text": "Ship Simulator Extremes is a Simulator which allows you to helm various types of vessels, in a variety of different modes. Free roam the seas, or play various campaigns, single player missions, or through multiplayer mode, Ship Simulator Extremes has a lot to offer the Ship Simulator enthusiest; However, there are also a few serious drawbacks. There is no playable tutorial, which teaches you how to operate the various ships, so you are thrown into campaigns, missions, and even free roam, completely blind. This makes the learning curve difficult for people who are casual players even if you have prior experience with other simulators. The piloting controls are based on realistic controls for each ship and you will need to figure it out as you go, which does give the game an interesting challenge, but could be seen as a turn off by those who do not want to spend hours doing what a playable tutorial would teach in minutes.   Another problem this particular game is notorious for is difficulty running on high end machines. I only experienced one crash in the little over an hour I played, so this is something to keep in mind if you have a decent gaming rig. The scenery looks great and the boats are very detailed, but it takes a while to get from point to point, so you need to have a lot of patience to play this game. All in all, I thought it was great as a simulator, though I have to knock it for the lack of a playable tutorial. The missions you can do are interesting, such as stopping cargo ships from dumping in the ocean, and so on. There is a lot to do in this game and the DLC's offer even more ships and missions to experience. Just make sure if you spend the money on this game, you are prepared for a steeper than normal learning curve and have a boatload of patience. (Pardon the pun).",

Positive's: - Good water affects and simulation  - I like the real boats and ferry companies which makes the game a lot more realistic - The different game modes - Really good dlc - Good variety of boats Negatives: - Been out of development for some time - Some missions crash - You can't press any of the buttons in the bridge - Old graphics engine - Works better with a high spec PC Overall I still really like playing it. I also hope that Paradox are going to make another one. I would choose this over WWS (at the moment). ",

            "review_text": "This game really isn't very good. I have a $600 radeon 7970 3gb video card and i thought it would easily be able to run this game at 300+ frames per second. But the water has a quality slider and there is only one setting where it looks halfway decent and that is when it shows whitecaps.. But at this setting my framerate drops to 18fps? In the first greenpeace mission i was literally driving on a boat down a port getting 11 frames per second. I had to set the water to cartoon setting to be able to play at a constant 40+ fps.   If you select 'very rough' the waves just look awful and clip through your screen and do all sorts of strange things, you can not run off the ship into the water, you can not climb the ladders to explore the second floor of the ships, you can not sink a ship. (it just says your ship is sinking game over)  Besides the poor performance the graphics are too cartoony for my liking. Sure outside it looks alright but the second you enter first person mode and walk around the ship the colors/surfaces make it look like you are on a childrens playground.  Other than that the controls are absolutely horrible, you have to physically click the steering wheel with your mouse and rotate it.. At first i was fine with it but the problem is that it begins rotating the wrong way once you start turning the wheel. Its almost impossible to turn your boat around.",

Moving past how unrealistic this program is for such a purpose, what you actually get when purchasing this game is a restricted version of the actual software, from which the snazzy screenshots above comes from. First off the game only runs on one core, so all the multi-core power in the world won't help you run this game at max graphics, which is still below the quality of the store page screenshots. (Which is, in fact, false advertising.) Nope, you purchased the game but you won't get the nice graphics or the FPS.  What you do get is a tacky, low-fps downscaled game that doesn't live up to be called a ship simulator.   The gameplay feels extremely linear, which is bizarre considering you're travelling on water, but is more or less inherited by the A to B mission objectives. Sometimes you have to do more than take your [boat] from one place to another, but then the game is deaf on its own triggers and tends to ignore the objective completion trigger the game told you to do earlier.  So in short, nope. I don't recommend it unless you're into mental challenges on par with Desert Bus. In fact get Desert Bus instead. It's free and has about the same novelty after 10 minutes as this title.",

It felt like more features were written into legacy code and there were no improvements. Games are getting rather sophisticated in physics and graphics and a title like Ship Simulator should be keeping pace with that.  The BAD: - Graphics compared to games now-a-days are lacking - The UI is faulty and needs a major overall - The game presents many bugs when trying to play on a newer machine (not made for the higher resolution displays) - Vessels handle in a very odd, unrealistic way. - Multi-player needs a lot of rework.

A big ship really feels like a big ship. They take a long time to get going, and a long time to stop. I was towing a huge container ship out of port, and mis-timed a turn. Nothing could stop the ship from slamming into the seawall. The water physics are equally as good. I was taking a speed boat for a whirl, when I came up next to an ocean liner at full clip.. THE WAKE ACTUALLY PULLS YOU IN TOWARDS THE BIGGER SHIP.. as I approached the bow, the bow wake flipped my little boat over without mercy... 10/10, would drown again..  The missions are fairly varied, and can take 1-2 hours each. It is too bad that this game can't be modded, but there is enough content to keep you busy for awhile. If you are looking for realism, you will find it here.. it is FAR more realistic than the prettier, and moddable, Vehicle Simulator (a good title in its own right, just not realistic at all.)",

Come Saturday morning I brewed a cup of coffee and it was nearly done loading. That afternoon I played with boats and found it to be satisfactory.  If you like boats, this might appeal. If you like crashing boats, this might appeal. If you like the concept of crashing big boats and wallowing in the sea in a life raft forever, get this game.",

As far as I can tell it is the exact same game with the same graphics. They added a few ships, but I think they removed at least one. This version is buggier and more resource intensive than it's predecessor. ShipSim 2008 came with quite a few scenarios, but Extremes only comes with 2 and you are apparently expected to purchase further scenarios if you want them. Also, in ShipSim 2008 there were AI controlled ships in free roaming mode, which made free roaming more interesting as you had to navigate around other traffic. As far as I've been able to find, Extremes has eliminated that feature.  All in all, Ship Simulator Extremes seems to be a considerable downgrade from the previous game.",

UPDATE:I got the game working and it does have a lot of cool features such as being able to deploy the lifeboats on a ship so I will recommend this just like I wanted to :D",

Dont understand why the game(s) cannot be used as stand alone if you not interested in multi player. Shame as when using windows 8 had many hours of enjoyment, but since buying new laptop and windows 10 total disaster, currently only playing ship simulator that works perfectly",
