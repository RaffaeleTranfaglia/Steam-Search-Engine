    "description": "Yon Paradox â€‹is a survival puzzle game where the hardest puzzle is yourself. Set in a cyber dimension, an antimatter-powered time machine broke, causing periodical time rewinds. You will have to solve riddles to repair the time machine, while avoiding your past alter-egos to not create paradoxes.",

The real difficulty involves moving strategically while you do the puzzles so that past versions of yourself don't see a future version.  I get motion sick very easily but found that by using keyboard and mouse instead of the controller I was able to play comfortably for much longer, so I'm glad it was an option.",
