            "review_text": "Epic game. When i first played this game, I was totally mindblown at how mature the storyline and how beautiful the graphics are.   I was and still baffled how almost nobody in Malaysia knows about this game when it first came out. A problem that still persists up till now.  This is not a game for the kiddies but I am sure this kind of game is recommended for people to understand gray moral choices that will somewhat help in real life decisions.  The drawback:  - controls are sometimes clunky (sometimes not being able to hit monsters when the target reticule is not on it, or Geralt performs a heavy attack when in actual you're pressing the light attack button)  - crashes frequently when I load a save game (happens when there is a bloat of save games)  - Tiring grind to get loads of gold to get and craft the Dark Armour Diagrams and materials. (you can only get Dark Armour in Dark Mode)  The Pros:  - Great Mature Storyline - Great Graphics for a 2011 game - Decent Moral Choices - Difficult Combat for newcomers but it will grow on you once you get the hang of it! (Pro Tips: DODGE! DODGE! DODGE!) - A developer who has managed to stay independent and still able to developed this great game - No DRM if you register the steam version on  GOG.com  for a backup copy for free! (the developer's subsidiary company that manages DRM-less games)  Buy this game to encourage more independent developers to churn out great games like this.  Plus, the sequel The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is coming out in February 2015. You will certainly have a better insight on the story if you played this first. Hey, even better if you buy both the Witcher 1 and Witcher 2!  This game is an AAA title (in terms of quality) in my list and one of few many games that i have replayed more than twice.  P.S. - Best played with a controller. Contains nudity and simulated sex",

If this isn't at least nominated for 'Game of the Year' I don't understand the Gaming Industry anymore. The graphics are amazing, the music is beautiful, and the game features some of the best quests I've seen in a long time. Everything from monster slaying, to hot chick laying, to a 'Hangover' style quest where you have to retrack the previous night drunken revelry. This game is a MUST for RPG fans.  POSSIBLE CON: The story continues immediately after the Witcher 1 and does NOT hold your hand. If you want background on characters or plot devices either play Witcher 1 or go wikipedia the storyline and get caught up.",

This came out the same time as Dragon Age II which i also purchased and i have to say after that dissapointment i could have kissed CDPR's feet after playing this gem 7 times to completion. The game requires you to play it twice to get the full story...but i just loved it that much. The dev is also awesome and deserves everyones support, they actually treat us with some respect and not cash cows .  EDIT : Unbelievable but they actually did it ! Witcher 3 is better than this amazing title.  Its really something special when a dev improves on each game in a trilogy MANY other large companies could learn a thing or two from these guys.",

The series are pinnacle of RPG gaming, and developers really tried to present the best RPG experience to the gamers, and, I dare to say, they succeeded.   The story of  Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings  takes place after the first game. Someone blamed you for murdering a King, and you set off to find out the culprit. Simple as that, but, the story is also about Geralt regaining his memories.   The graphics are quite good and enchanted in relation to the first  Witcher  game. Attentions to the small things are amazing, from the detailed characters and environments to special effects, and  Witcher  is a truly an eye candy for gaming masses. In regard to that, you really need a high end PC machine to play the  Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings .   The world of  Witcher  is huge and along the way you will meet a bunch of interesting characters, have a lot of...virtual sex, fight many kind of monsters, etc. Sometimes the game feels a bit to grindy, but your choices and fights you are engaging yourself into really impact the outcome of the story. Sometimes the battles seem a bit to tough, and RPG beginners could find the game more challenging, but, once you gain enough experience under your belt, the battles become easier.   All  Witcher  games are highly recommended, and this one is no exception. This is simply something best that RPG games can offer. Don't miss it.",

This game has the perefct balance between story, gameplay, and game lenght. There's quite a bit of dialog, but if you dont like it, you can just skip the talking.   This is a rpg game for adults. There's politics, ethical problems, and a bunch of hard choises to make. I spent about 35 hours, and I did almost everything the game has to offer. There's an arena mode wich does not have anything to do with the story of the game, where you fight against increasingly hard waves of enemies, wich game me an hour of enjoyment, but you can play it for quite a bit.   In summary, this is one of the best games I have played. The story is amazing, and i was caught in the situations of the game at all times. I was suprised when the game was finished, since I didn't feel time flowing. The gameplay is an HUGE upgrade from the last one, and skill is a bigger factor than stats. The lore and immersion is fantastisc, i actually went through all the books i found. It altso looks amazing, still, in 2016.   This one is among the best games I have played, and it deserves a 10/10. Now, I'm starting the third, and probably the last game in the series. Va'fail!",

Once I got through the first chapter, I hit my stride then and figured out how to be a more effective Witcher, and the initial learning curve was overcome. Gameplay is good, coupled with really good fighting animations, proves for a satisfying experience. Graphics and audio are very well done; the game has a satisfying and fitting soundtrack. The story is interesting, and I always felt compelled to find out what happens next. However it does allude to the first game quite a bit, and while it does fill in some details for you, it may be better to play through the first game, but in my opinion it is not absolutely necessary. The game also features multiple meaningful choices and there are several endings to obtain, giving alot more playabilty. All in all I would highly recommend it.",

            "review_text": "Really, I could probably summarize Witcher 2 by saying it's an improvement over the original in almost every game-related way that matters, subjective things like atmosphere and alike being debatable, because CDPR upped their game significantly and actually worked with the engine of their own making, but that would be an easy way out and I like to complicate my life.  First notable change is a clear 180 towards making the game into a more action-based installment, further enforced by removal of old combat styles and instead focusing on light and heavy attacks which give you more freedom in a sense that you can combine them on the fly without getting locked into a carefully choreographed sequences. Other than that there are changes which I would tentatively summarize as 'streamlining done right' which is quite a claim in this day and age – alchemy removes the need for alcohol basis which finally lets Geralt stop being a walking cellar lugging around all kinds of high quality alcohol. It should also be noted that changes like these don't really simplify the game in any significant fashion primarily because other elements, like actual gear variety, addition of proper crafting and traps, etc easily offset whatever may have been removed. That's not to say everything is perfect because some people had problems with the way combat works and overreliance on Quen aka protection Sign as a crutch, but I never really went through those problems so I can't testify to that.  Story and characters of the game are an entirely separate beast worthy of being mentioned on their own. Witcher 2 continues after the first game, but works perfectly fine as a standalone story, although it is HIGHLY recommended that you're familiar with the original to understand who's who and what's happening in general. It retains the same old moral ambiguity and holds back no punches for the player but it's even better this time around thanks to increased world reactivity as well as choices &amp; consequences which are really cranked up to 11. Fact that Act 2 is different depending on a choice you make previously practically guarantees at least two playthroughs to get the entire story and even then you'll still miss some modular things which can be done differently. Even though the stakes have escalated as far as the story goes, it's still a story very much grounded in reality except you now get to dabble in politics beyond just a cursory introduction.  In the end Witcher 2 gets a resounding thumbs up from me. Importing your old Witcher 1 save file is also recommended. Not so much for the imported gear you'll replace fairly quickly so much as for decisions you made previously.",

After purchasing the first and second games for the price of a chocolate milk, I have spent over 85 hours on the games. I really enjoyed the first one, then when I played this it blew my expectations out of the water. The story, the characters, the settings, but most of all the highly improved sword and fighting mechanics. I finally felt in control of Geralt.   This game was smooth and well polished at the time of playing. Although some of the game seemed quite easy, it regularly proved to be difficult in others requiring you to think about your steps. Not challenging enough to make you give up, but enough to really involve you in the battle. Yet, this is where my one complain of the game comes up. You cannot consume any of your alchemy items or oil your blade once the fight has started. A lot of the time you may not know who you are going to fight or when. Since all consumables are timed, you don't want to always use them up. This meant sometimes saving your game, running around, loading back to the previous save to know what you should consume. I hope in the 3rd title this is changed back.   Over all, amazing game. Will play through again since the story can go 2 ways. I want to see both paths that Geralt takes and am really looking forward to playing through again.   Also want to see how many boobies I can convince women to show me since so far it's 100% more in this game than real life.",

            "review_text": "This review is from the perspective of a new player to the series. Yes I have “played” the first witcher but dropped it after realizing how broken the game play is.  The points: + Controller support + Combat + Dialog + Characters + Art/Level Design + Solo + One Ring to Rule Them all/ Lesbomancy  ~ Animation ~ Story (my bad) ~ Menus  - The world - Short - Triss’s BS  8/10  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Okay let's start off with the middle ground issues, the ones that were annoying but didn’t break it for me. The animation at times was great the problem is the other 50% of the time they look like ventriloquist dummies, which is worse than the Mass effect stare. The story is very hard to follow and get into the swing of understanding it however after about 3 hours in I could fully understand what was going on. The menus leave much to be desired but it’s a huge step up from witcher 1, it took about an hour to get used to after that didn’t have much issue.  Now the negative, the world makes no sense I don’t understand how 8 tiny countries smaller than rhode island can pump out more then the huge southern nation. I’m sorry but these nations are conquered. The story is short like COD level game short for a RPG. And Lastly Triss’s ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, this is not a damsel in distress issue. The issue with Triss is it’s obvious by the 80% mark of the main story that ALL this time she has been lying and manipulating you, BUT NOTHING COMES OF IT. no dialog, no nothing, I’ll be starting Wild Hunt sometime today if this is not brought up I will mark that game down as well for this.   Now for the good, I glad this game has controller support because rolling around using a keyboard would have been a massive pain. And it’s done very well, I have some issues with inventory but besides that everything was handled well. The combat is actually combat in this game I can sense hints of Dark Souls, which isn’t bad because this game has a better combat system then Dark Souls (no one likes a game that ques your button presses). The dialog is not Mass Effect level crap of good, funny, and mad. It’s actually a bunch of options that may lead you to what you need. The Dialog system shines best with the Golem in the mission The Secrets of Loc Muinne. The characters are properly developed and have depth to back them except for Triss(her whole character is “she wants your D” -.- not joking). The world is beautiful and the levels are large enough for the time spent in each area to make it worth it. And lastly the solo experience, this is Geralt’s story not “Geralt and his friends” story. At first I thought I would hate this, but as time went on it made you feel more awesome. Do to the fact you were doing everything on your own.",

In one playthrough,   Geralt aided the murder of a king. (He deserved it!)   In another,   Geralt was a liberator  . The third time, our 'hero' was in it for himself reigning death &amp; having mobs have their way.  Other games are just too linear by following a single path to a given destination.  The Witcher 2  destroys the mold by varying the direction of the game. By the 2nd chapter you've chosen a side which massively affects everything: allies may now be enemies, where you end up is completely different, and those you saved may have dire consequences later on.  With multiple endings, I highly recommend this RPG.",

Second chapter of the game looks completly different depending on our previous decisions. The story is pretty decent, just a bit 'too political' in my opinion, but all those movie-like cutscenes are downright gorgeous. It just makes it really easy to feel involed in what's going on. Combat is ok, sort of a tactical hack &amp; slash. It's up to us whether we'll help ourselves with magical signs, traps, potions or with little of everything. The only two flaws that I can think of is difficulty arch (game is hard at the beggining and gets quite easy later), and the fact that it could really be longer. Takes 20+ hours to finish the main story, and 30+ hours to finish it with all the side quests. But still I think it's a great game and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes action RPGs.",

Although there are some linear sections sprinkled throughout the game, the developers have done a good job ensuring these don't feel too constraining to the player.

            "review_text": "Before we proceed, understand that I actually like the gameplay in The Witcher 2. In fact, it's exceptional. Combat is easy to play yet hard to master – an elusive quality in action RPG combat mechanics – with plenty of difficulty and interesting combat scenarios. By the end of the incredibly well put-together tutorial, you'll feel like you honestly participated in medieval siege. A rich and complex crafting system underpins plenty of gameplay interactions and makes many of the incidental bits of junk you collect through the game have real value. And on top of all of this, The Witcher 2 is one of those rare RPGs that flirts with having real consequence to player decisions throughout the dialogue.  Thus, I feel I have to give The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings a good review score; by every objective standard of game design, development, and production values, it is an excellent game. I cannot recommend it unreservedly, however, as a few things about the game never quite clicked into place for me. I found myself, at the end of it, more stricken by some of the evident gaps in story and gameplay direction than enthusiastic for the inevitable sequel that, presumably, will tie together the numerous loose ends of the storyline.  The first Witcher was a game that I had a very hard time playing through. On the one hand, I loved the writing and variety of choice available throughout the dialogue and intrigue portions of the game; on the other hand, most of the momentary gameplay was painfully overcomplicated and obtuse. Any game requiring that I explicitly enter combat mode and then explicitly choose a stance before I can start wailing on dudes loses points in my book. The Witcher 2 eschews many of the more glaring flaws of the original game—a more streamlined UI, a closer camera so you can really see what's going on, and a combat system that emphasizes skill are all welcome additions to the series.  There are some distinct flaws in the gameplay, though nothing major. The first and most obvious one is how side quest objectives are communicated. The Witcher 2 has joined the slew of recent games that basically lead you through the objectives to complete side quests (and, actually, main quests) by hand. While I have some objections to that in general, my complaint in this case is more about some of the little gaffes in how that's presented.  The next major flaw in the gameplay is that autosaving is used in the game, but not always in intelligent ways. At some boss fights, the game will autosave right before the big introduction cut-scene of the boss. This makes sense if you walk away from the game for a few days after dying to the monster once; but if you're like me, and try again... several times... then needing to blunder through the cut-scene time and again becomes a real nuisance.  The third major flaw is that there are unique gameplay modes – such as stealth – which will activate contextually, but you are explicitly told to enter them. Since the game decides when you enter into the mode, why are you telling me to go into the mode? What button is that? Not a big deal by any means, but a little irritation all the same.  Graphically and aurally, the Witcher 2 is a very well put-together game. Lush visuals, fantastic texture work, great visual effects, and clear iconography keep the game attractive.   The music is, by and large, very fitting, and the sound design tactfully places you in the middle of the events of the game. Lots of nice little touches – folks chopping away at wood in a little village, the crumbling of nearby rocks as you climb down a cliff face, or the occasional snap of twigs as you tromp through the forest – pop out of the speakers regularly. Voice acting is also quite good.   I think I take the most issue with the writing and character design. By and large, the Witcher series has a very dim view of most people. Just about everyone is an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in The Witcher 2; even Geralt's sorceress girlfriend, the character who the writers tried hardest to make sympathetic, comes off as a catty, jealous ♥♥♥♥♥ at times. It's not that I believe people are always nice and friendly, but when there's not a single decent person to talk to, it gets hard to take any of the characters seriously.  The other side of this is that some of the best written, most charismatic and genuinely fun characters to be around don't last terribly long. This is made abundantly clear by the end of the tutorial. Apparently in Witcher world, fun people aren't fit to live.  By the end of the game, I found myself left with a distinctly ashen taste in my mouth; the victories are left hollow and incomplete. Partially because the ending doesn't fully resolve the numerous sub-plots of the game, but also because the storyline felt arbitrary and disconnected. The Witcher's style – weirdly dark and artificially edgy, especially for a fantasy title – creates disjointed storylines that, even when the promised ending occurs, are a letdown.  I also might mention that The Witcher 2 represents a... particular view of women. If you are comfortable seeing women portrayed as little more than ♥♥♥♥ and ♥♥♥, then this is the game for you! If, on the other hand, you find the lack of strong female characters in games to be irritating, then this really isn't for you. Triss and Ves, two of the notable female characters of the game, don't count, by the way; both spend most of their screen-time in form-fitting outfits, prancing their overly shapely asses about the focus point of the camera and generally requiring Geralt's manly help to accomplish much of anything.  Despite all the little flaws and caveats, The Witcher 2 is, ultimately, a fantastic game; any fan of darker, more consequentialist fiction will find themselves right at home. Nevertheless, those of you looking for something more upbeat, more uplifting – and frankly, less draining to play – will want to look elsewhere. The Witcher 2 is bittersweet.",

Branching storylines encourage replayability, as in the first game. At first I had a problem with the excessive use of bloom and shader effects, though these things are implemented far better and more artistically after the first chapter, so I suggest everyone keep these settings enabled.

It doesn't feel right.  - Unbalanced gameplay mechanics - Oils and potions barely last long enough to be of any use, and forcing you to drink them in meditation mode is tiresome. Also fairly unrealistic and breaks immersion somewhat. Many skills over/underpowered (i.e. dodge-roll, shield sign, alchemy tree etc.) -Clunky UI and menus. Bad sorting options, unintuitive selection design (i.e. hover over recipe with mouse cursor, then press space or enter to complete recipe. but don't click and make sure not to move your mouse away from recipe in list). The map, while looking totally freaking awesome, is almost entirely useless. Many more problems with UI. -Lack of camera controls and options. -Unclear or non-existent tutorials. -Also, doors. OMG DOORS. Another obvious piece of the game programmed with the fortcoming console port in mind.  Overall. 6/10.

I could only roll and slash with my sword and do some wierd fire thing. Wtf Nintendo? Please fix this.  I also found it strange that a man can apparently kill a king in broad daylight in his own room in his own castle, only to escape by jumping out of a nearby window and plummeting to freedom whilst the main character sort of just stands there with his sword out and takes the hit for the whole thing. Why didn't Geralt just teleport away like he did earlier?   On the other hand, almost every female character is naked at one point during this game, which is edgy for Nintendo to say the least.

Its a compelling narrative about maintaining neutrality in a world that is morally ambiguous and deceptive. You will feel the sting of unintended consequences, and with a variety of supporting characters, all whose lives and motivations you will come to understand, decisions in this game are not made lightly . Aside from its storyline, the actual mechanics of the gameplay are superbly executed. Combat is visceral and tactical. Magic, Alchemy, and swordplay are your means of defeating your enemies, and the Witcher 2 introduces a menagerie containing all sorts of monsters, both fantastically gargantuan &amp; sometimes human, whose strengths/weaknesses must be taken into account, especially on the hardest of difficulties.

The choices witcher 2 supplies has you picking from one evil or another evil, with no one being greater than the other. You don't gain lightside or darkside points, you just are the way you chose. Combat is pretty straight forward, you have a sliver sword that kills monsters and a iron sword to kill humans. Potions can be consumed before a fight to say increase your ability to dodge incoming attacks or see in the dark. Geralt of rivia has large skill tree, and each point you put it makes you feel stronger, wither it be strength, wisdom, or alchemy. Geralt the character you lead through this adventure is a anti-hero to a T. Geralt's profession is monster slaying, with a bit of humans on the side.

Overall, a great game that lets you know how great Geralt of Rivia is before heading over to The Witcher 3, which is the next one on my list!",

Hard=Rewarding combat -&gt; In the beginning you might find the combat hard, but if you spend some time in the 'Arena' (an Arcade like mode that you can play before you start the story , you can practice and learn the combat). Killing a monster makes you feel like a real witcher , because it requires skill and THOGHT.  Great side missions -&gt; The side missions are NOT repetitive. In each area you will have contracts which you don`t have to take, they are not even mentioned in the story , you will have to find the board where they are posted on. They EXPAND the world of the witcher. There are huge areas that you might not even see if you don't take on the side missions.

            "review_text": "The Witcher 2 isn't a perfect game. The inventory system is pretty terrible compared to Witcher 1's, blade oils and potions have been downgraded significantly (and the timers for them, now reduced to a few minutes at most, don't seem to pause during dialogue, meaning if you don't skip through dialogue after reading the subtitles you might spent several potions and oils preparing for a fight only get into a pre-fight dialogue and have them all unwittingly wasted away), and the magical signs in turn have been buffed to the point of almost being broken, with Yrden in particular rendering most bosses trivial. The dice poker is now a single-round exercise in trying to move your mouse as microscopically as you can in order to not cause every dice to go canonballing off of the board, and the fistfighting diversion is now just a bunch of QTEs.  But when you look past all that, The Witcher 2 is by far one of the better RPGs of its generation. The dialogue and general writing are great, and the politics and general lore are more fleshed out and interesting than in the first game. The quest design in general has been greatly improved, and even though there are less monster hunting quests than in the first game they're generally deeper, involving you researching the monsters and doing specific goals to fully eradicate the threat instead of just lobbing off a few heads and turning them in. The game is overall shorter than the first game, but only because it branches off after the first chapter and essentially becomes two different stories which then further branch out, leading to plenty of replayability. You'll have forgotten all of the flaws I listed up above within the first chapter of the game, and it's overall definitely worth a purchase if you're into RPGs.   ",

I can't really think of much bad to say about this game. It's really well made, the story/characters are interesting, and it's well-written and voiced. Witcher 2 also features a major branching story path at the end of chapter 1 that totally changes the rest of the game, which in turn adds a ton of replay value if you really want to see everything.

            "review_text": "if you ever thought that fairytales and fantasy creatures are just for kids then you didnt have the chance to take a glimpse of the world of the witcher where power corrupted politics meet dangerous bloodthirsty creatures.  The witcher is an rpg game franchise with characters based on short story collections that later became a saga of novels writen by a polish writer Andrzej Sapkowski.Cd projekt red is the team that took this fantasy world into the pc.The story is about a witcher named geralt of rivia.Witchers are mercenaries,hunters of mythical beasts hired even by kings.In the second part of the saga, the kings of the north are slayed by mercenaries and one of them in front of geralt who is accused of the murder as he was found alone with the dead body of the king.The tale starts as he is trying to clear his name by finding and killing the murderer.   The visual design of the game is plus moderate compared to 2014 games as when it was published was on the top of the rpg games.The lanscapes, the cities, the alleys, models everything on it made me feel as i was part of a graphic novel, living, breathing in it.The game as a whole made me explore every alley of it remembering every path of the map by heart. It resembles the fable saga in a significantly darker tone in a cruel world with nudity and teriffying creatures.   It worked in general on high frames except the third act where i found it drop at 15-20 frames.It is still a heavy game.Ι also want to point that there is no support for 2560-1080 screens.I used the flawless widescreen app to play it on full screen.   It took me 35 hours to clear the game but without some sidequests that i missed as it was my original first gameplay, so i think that it provides 38-40 hours of playtime. Surviving in this world depends not only on your sword skills nor your magic skills but as a combinbation of everything that is provided. I discovered that on the hard way as i died again and again on the first hours. I saw the game-over screen many times, the loading screen is the fastest i have ever seen and after finishing the evil within it was like paradise. Runes ,enchantments,oils,poisons,potions traps everything are essential for survival. I found myself using everythimg on my disposal for the first time.Υou dont play a witcher ,the game is made to make you feel that you are one and acting as one .The inventory menu needs some improvement though. Magic is just for support dont expect to make a mage character. Αs for the sword fight, is immersive but with some problems when it comes to multi-fights.   Closing this review i want to add that choices does matter on this one and depending on what you choose, you affect politics and play different quests.So it provides different gameplay build everytime.Plus you can import your witcher 1 save and depending on your inventory and your story path you acquire some swords and coins on your witcher 2 start and in a few occusions it affects the game but dont except really big changes.

My few complaints about the game were very small things like how you dont get to assume the neutral witcher path like you could in the first game. Also why cant you jump whats up with that? Luckily I know that at least one of those is being implemented into The Witcher 3 so we got that going for us.

The story was brilliant, if sometimes confusing.   So, naturally, I was deeply worried about the second part, since so many companies successfully mess it up. Luckily, CD Project did. not. Yes, it is different in certain aspects - the fighting system is different, for instance. In my opinion, it is better. It certainly feels more fluent. The 'playing cards' are gone - but then, you won't get as many chances to seduce women, due to the story. Which, by the way, is far easier to follow and goes forward faster - which is way this game can seem much shorter than the first part, even though it actually isn't. Other things like the quality of the story, graphics or atmosphere have not changed but remain on a very, very high level.   So, yes, I recommend buying this game. For all the reasons stated above and for the additional one that by buying this game, one supports a great game studio which does everything right when it comes to supporting their community.

It is not as large as Skyrim but because of that the details are much finer and better. It has extensive level up systems, crafting, equipment and combat varieties that I believe are essential in RPG gameplay. • The combat overall is strategic, if you try to brute force your way it may take you several deaths and tries to progress. You will need to make use of all resources • The story is incredible with your different choices in game that will results in a variety of endings for this game. But to see if our choices will have true impact we will have to wait for “The Witcher 3” to come out and see if our imported “Witcher 2” files will do any impact on the story or just carry over character upgrades. • It is dense with content and will give you a considerable amount of hours of entertainment. This game with its dense gameplay, in-depth story and incredible visuals and it fun factor earn it a 10/10.

The many branching storylines that unfold based on the players choice also give a huge amount of replayablity to the game, the branches aren't minor choices they are major and greatly affect how the rest of the game plays out.  If you were a fan of the first game I would defiantly get this by the way. This game gets a 10/10 from me it was amazing.",

Combat system is perfect, but you must think about every your step very carefully or you will die. Many of side missions have interesting but sometimes hard puzzles. There's not guide that show you the mission object, NO! you must find it! bcs why not looking for object half hour ! The game has tons of side quests but every quest is original. Be prepared for long dialogues bcs without them you can't do some missions. Size of the map is very small compare to Witcher 3 but it isn't big problem.   pros",

Unlike the first game of the series, the graphics are far more refined, the story is much more cohesive, complex and inline with what original stories would lead to, and is exactly what CDProjekt were hoping to create with the first game. not only does choice matter, it is essential to the very core of the game. every decision has a consequence, whether you see it now or at the end of your journey. this is the type of game that bioware has wet dreams about but instead sells you a half ♥♥♥ copy of. litteraly the 2nd half of the game takes completely different paths depending on a not so simple choice in the 1st chapter. one of my personal favorite features is 'survivor mode'...dont be fooled, combat can be extremely difficult in this game, but entering the arena is a nice change of pace that will give you some, albiet, over exaggerated practice, but it is a great time killer that will keep you going in the hopes taht you can get your name of the leader board. highly addictive and extremely punishing to the say the least, especially at higher difficulty levels. sure theres flaws, very few games are without but this is a game, that even if you didnt play the first, will have you from beginning to end leaving you begging for more, and unlike most games that claim to be of the same ilk....*cough* mass effect, there actually is more to do that you can not do because of the decisions that you made the first time around. Buy this game now, especially being 5$ as it will give you some back info to Witcher 3.  p.s. if you can get your hands on teh novels, they are fantastic and really give a detailed backstory on most characters, especially geralt and his close companions. trust me you wont regret this purchase &lt;3",

Its strangely missing in some cutscenes (footsteps, sword slashes, punching noises, ambient noises), under-delivered in other instances (some crowd noise seems weak and out of place), with some dialogue drowned out by music or other ambient noise (Geralts voice actor, while awesome, is sometimes inaudible due to acompanying audio). Audio is the #1 thing in games, where if done wrong, can remove me from the experience. Animations are #2. Outside of pre-rendered cutscenes and combat, character animations are stilted and ugly. Don't go into this game expecting to see facial animations either, because they don't exist. There is just barely lip sync. While not entirely impactful on my experience with the game as a whole, I would like to critique the level design in the final chapter. Loc Muinne is a maze with very few landmarks. It was just kind of a pain getting around that level. I look forward to the sequel which promises to be open world. That would suit a game like this better. Linear level design just feels wrong. Also, the pacing in this game is off. I didn't find myself invested in the story until the end of chapter 2, which is 2/3 of the way through the game. I may be to blame for not playing the first game, or reading the books, but really... as a game designer, you have to have a plan to bring new players into the fold, and to get them interested in your story as well.   With all of that said, the game is very good. The combat is great. The story is well layered, and well delivered. In fact, its well supported as well. I found myself spacing out during several cutscenes and afterwards saying, 'OOOOOOKKKKKKK... WTF just happened again?' No problemo. Open the journal, read the journal entry for the mission I am on, and the cutscene is well summarized right there. With the awesome journal, I was able to keep up with the story, and learn a little more about the game's story. So, definetely a recommend.",

            "review_text": "Probably the most underrated CRPG out there. This game is a gemstone that stands as an example to traditional role playing game developing companies like Bethesda and Bioware. It's been developed by a Polish game company named CDProjekt with no desire to be a part of today's competitive capitalist game industry. A lot of time and effort was spent in creating this game as it's a well polished, very original rpg unlike many unripe games we see today.   It takes place in a fantasy world where three northern kingdoms, Temeria, Redenia, Kaedwen (and previously Aedirn) deal with internal turmoils as a mysterious assassin begins to collect crowned heads as in south, expantionist Nilfgaardian Empire stands ready. Also, a resistance guerilla force including non-humans called Scoi'tel emerges to fight for the oppressed and the protagonist, Geralt of Rivia finds himself in the middle of the conflict.  The atmosphere of the environments are truly amazing thanks to stunning visuals and beautiful background soundtrack. Instead of wandering through one vast geographical area like the one in Skyrim, The Witcher 2 takes place in 3 different regions and the player allowed and encouraged to explore each one in all three chapters, Temerian village of Flotsam next to a swamp-forest, Dwarven city of Vergen on top of the Blue Mountains and finally the ancient city of Loc Muinne, now in ruins.  The game's combat system is rather old-school and takes time to get used to it. Once getting familiar with it however, you will see how fun it is. You carry two swords, a steel one for humanoids and a silver one for monsters. Gerald posseses 5 magical abilites called 'Signs' allowing you to stun, ignite, trap, convert enemies along with providing protection. Alchemy system allows you to craft potions and swords oils giving you various advantages, but you need to use them 'before' the battle, not during! As Geralt finishes quests, contracts and kills monsters he levels up, providing skill points to spend in TW2's vast skill tree. Since you cannot unlock all nodes in the skill tree, you need to customize your character in Magic, Melee and Alchemy.  To sum up, if you call yourself a rpg person, you should definetly play this game. The first game of the installement is said to be very problematic but no worries, you can start of the series directly with TW2 as i did. The lore and role playing elements are well thought and captivating, encouraging you to do more than one playthroughs. It's a very cheap game for its quality.

The combat is basically a mix of traps, throwable weapons, potions, spells, and simple but never boring sword fighting. On easier diffuculty you only have to worry about doing one or 2 of those things right, but on harder difficultys you need to pay attention to all of them because you will need them. You can craft everything that you will need for combat using simple mix of ingrediants from the world.   The story is very mature. If you are interested political conflicts that are dealt with in old fashioned ways than this is the game for you. Characters are all very well put and you will never forget a face in the game.

            "review_text": "This game is one of my favorite RPGs of all time. It has a really strong and compelling narrative and offers you plenty of chances to make choices that feel like they have some weight to them, though, perhaps not as much as the first game. The characters are mostly interesting, and the character development is definitely there. One of my favorite things about the story and characters is the moral ambiguity of it all. There is no clear distinction of good and evil between any of the sides. Simply two perspectives of what's right. The combat feels pretty fluid and I greatly enjoyed it. I liked how alchemy worked in the game, too. It's unnecessary in the first two difficulties, but in the higher ones, you'll find yourself greatly crippled if not using it. You cannot use potions in combat, so that adds some strategy to it. The game is absolutely beautiful on ultra settings, and it still looks pretty great even on lowers ones. The environment does at least. Nothing seems out of place in the world, the enemies are well designed and plenty creepy at times. They did a great job crafting the world.  That doesn't mean it's without its issues, though. The combat does seem pretty fluid, but in higher difficulties you'll find yourself rolling endlessly across the ground with your foes in hot pursuit. Blocking is often times useless, and there is very noticeable input lag on occasion. There's also a noticeable disparity between easy and normal difficulties. Easy being ridiculously so, and normal for new players likely quite challenging in the beginning. Also, though I enjoyed how alchemy works, it also leads to an obvious issue that can break the fluidity/immersion of the game. Since you can't use potions outside of battle, this leads most people to entering a fight to see which potion they should use for which resistances or buffs, loading a quicksave, and then using the potion. I love the idea and how it fits into the Witcher lore, but it needs some work. Also, either a pro or a con depending on your preferences, but it's not really an open world, and there's very few side-quests. You go from hub to hub, each having a few explorable zones mainly comprised of small passages. As far as the side-quests go, there's around 8 or so for the first 2 acts, I believe. Not really all that many. It leads to it being a fairly short game as far as RPGs go. Mentioning the choices again, I loved how they were worked into the game and they did 'feel' weighty, though they didn't really mean much. You still end up in more or less the same situations with the same people doing the same things.   And then there's the much touted 'Maturity' of the game. Yes, it may be much more so than many other RPGs, and it's definitely a dark game. The moral ambiguity definitely plays into this as well. With that said a lot of said 'maturity' seems to stem from the idea that sex jokes are funny and adult. The characters way to often bring up 'ploughing', at times it seems like every other sentence, though it's not really. It comes across as juvenile and cheap. There's mature themes throughout the game, though a lot of the perception of that seems attributed to the sexed up atmosphere. At least they removed the sex cards from the first game.   I probably missed quite a few things, this is just some stuff that came to mind. Might edit it on occasion.  I still recommend this game overall. It is quite enjoyable and the Witcher 3 is looking like a great game, so jumping into the series before that would probably be a good idea. It's on sale quite often, and even if not, it is easily worth $20 when it's not.",

Obviously the graphics and engine are a big improvement from the first one, also the combat feels better. Honestly I feel like the combat in this reminds me a lot of the combat in Dark Souls, it is also just as deadly. If that is one thing I can impart that feels the most different from the first game it's that in the first game it isn't too uncommon to be fighting 6-8 monsters sometimes at once, and not really even break a sweat, not so in 2, you really need to pay attention, and use that dodge and parry and your aards. Treat every combat as if you could die easily in it, because you probably will.  Also you can no longer drink potions during combat, you have to prepare for battles by drinking potions only when you are meditating, on the plus side, as long as you are not in combat it seems you can meditate anywhere, and do not need a fire. All in all The Witcher 2 pretty much improves on all aspects of The Witcher 1.   Just one thing: skip the tutorial, it is awful.",

It's a fantastic and well-told tale, layered over very solid mechanical underpinnings: A flexible character development system, glorious eye candy, intense combat and more than enough secondary content to camouflage its very linear nature.

            "review_text": "This game is a huge improvement over the first part. I honestly thought that they just fired all the people who previously worked on The Witcher and brought in a new team to make this awesome game. But nope, its still CD Projekt RED, I really don't know what happened in their offices during the course of just a few years, but they came up huge with a Witcher game that actually should've been the first in the series. It still has flaws, yes, it borrows some gameplay elements from a small list of successful titles and not as perfect in everything as it could potentially be, but they made so many improvements... It's just scary to think of it sometimes.  I'll elaborate on all the good and bad sides of this game, but I can assure you right now - this game is worth your time and money.  So, whats so good about it?    Combat is fun now. Yeah, it really is. It shares a decent amount with games like Demon's Souls &amp; Batman (Arkham series), it's a bit simplified, but very fun. You now have daggers and traps at your disposal along with an enhanced array of bombs, you finally can dodge and block (and even parry if unlock a specific perk!) enemy attacks and topple them with improved witcher signs (still 5 signs, but they work slightly different).   Quest system is improved also, there are many interesting and cryptic side quests that requires an actual thinking before they can be solved and the game only provides 'hand holding' for quests related to the main story.   They added a huge amount of items, times where you had to choose between 3 viable swords in the first Witcher are gone. Every chapter contains at least several good swords and armors and other pieces of equipment to look for. You can even customize your armor with runes now, not only swords.   Skill trees were completely reworked. You now have 4 trees: Training, Warrior, Mage and Alchemist. Level cap now is 35 and you are forced to put 6 skill points into a Training tree which leaves you with 29 more skill points, it means that basically you can only max out one tree or mix it up between the 2 of your choice. It may sound harsh at first but that's more than enough in the end to build a very powerful character.   New adrenaline skill system introduced: each skill tree has it's own 'super ability' which you can activate by filling an adrenaline bar (it usually fills just by hitting your foes).   There's a real inventory now (yay!) where you can store weapons/armor and other things you've found. It based on the 'weight' stat, much like in Fallout 3.   Role playing is still here, you can be a bad guy killing everyone or a peaceful 'problem solver', it's up to you. You need to complete the game at least 2 times to learn and understand everything, both playthroughs will be very different.   Many memorable characters you'll encounter along your path, all with their stories and even a decent amount of drama usually.   Narrative element is still very strong and all dialogues are voiced again which is really awesome.   Game looks gorgeous and optimized much better than it's predecessor.   Now to the things I didn't quite like:   The game is pretty short. I always complete all quests, but if you just rush through the story then you probably can complete this game in under 20 hours (depending on the difficulty setting).   Difficulty is a problem yet again. There are 5 difficulty settings this time, but CD Projekt RED has some tough times balancing mid-late game witcher against his foes. When you hit mid game, like level 10-15 - the game becomes a faceroll mostly, witcher has so much power and tools to deal with anything, it's just ridiculous. The only tough mode is Insane, which is basically a hardcore mode, where you can't die even once. But considering game length and how powerful witcher can be it's not that big of a deal to beat it after completing a game once or twice.   You can now drink potions only while meditating. An unnecessary rule in my opinion considering that potion effects lasts less longer than in the first game.   Main antagonist despite having a good presentation never develops into a memorable character and boss fights vs him are extremely underwhelming. It's pretty disappointing for for such a good game.   Save system is quite bad. Each time you press 'save' game just autosaves and every time it creates a new file, not to mention all those scripted autosaves made by game after certain events. All that leads to a giant pile of save files which leads to an occasional crash while trying to load the game, to fix this you have to manually delete save files from your PC.   UI could be better. When you amass a good load of items it becomes inconvenient to scroll-search for them in such a small window.   Despite the downsides, it's still an amazing package, in my opinion it's a 'must play' for anyone who enjoys story driven or action RPGs. Well... And for the Witcher fans of course!  8/10.",

Here are some of the flaws: It could have been longer. The combat mechanics could have much been more complex, The saved games system is very poor. You can't overwrite or arrange saved games. The looting system is a joke for a RPG. You can steal almost everything in the game without consequences. The side quests could offer more details, You have to use potions before a fight and not during it. Vigor doesn't replenish while Quen is active, thus limiting your playstyle. Game crashed quite often.  To sum up, Witcher 2 is a good game, but not perfect. You might like it or you'll be disappointed. For me, the story and characters helped me overlook some of flaws. It does take a while to be captivated by the game, so I advise you to be patient. ",

Great graphics although it could use a bit of optimizing. The DoF is so aggressive its annoying as hell therefore I always keep it off. The sword play (the only way to play the game) is fun at times but tedious when playing in Dark difficulty; each fight becomes a minigame, hit once or twice lowering the enemy's health by one pixel and roll back to avoid getting hit (otherwise loose 1/3 of your health and sometimes getting insta-killed). Could use more customization options in-game, such as keeping only the 3 last autosaves. I have to keep manually deleting them otherwise the main menu will take forever to load because of so many saves. Also the game autosaves at very unconvenient times, so I stick to quicksaves most of the times.",

Loads faster(which is kind of surprising because the first game's load times weren't even long), stutters less, and, of course, looks prettier. And I mean much prettier. You don't expect games that look this much better than their prequels to actually perform better than them.  The only things about it that I don't like are the differed rendering(alternate form of rendering that only supports [and works] [with] a form of anti-aliasing that has been specifically coded into the game, cancelling out any kind of AA forced on from your graphics control panel. Use SweetFX for AA.), sharpness filter(you'll wanna turn it off in your user config, but make sure to force Anisotrophic Filtering on), and the bloom. The bloom.. I usually am ok with bloom in my games, but I had to turn this game's off. There is just too much of it. For my eyes, anyway.  Graphics settings: Many graphics settings available for tweaking. There's a lot you can make changes to that will help the game run better on your rig, if it needs it  Controls: Controls are greatly improved. Dodging actually works consistently, unlike in the last game. Same with parrying. Same with attacking. I remember instances in the first Witcher where the system sometimes wouldn't let me attack opponents if they were close to me or surrounded me or just didn't let me attack them(while not stunned, etc). When attacking, you use either the left or right mouse button. Either are for heavy or light attacks. Is not like the first Witcher where you select an attack style and click on a foe. The buttons are the styles, so they have to be used/pressed after each attack. Can be combined.  They took out the feature that let's you press/hold a button/key to highlight/display whatever in view can be interacted with, as well as the the feature that's you select what you want to interact with the cursor, while you hold/press a button. It's not that big of a deal not having it, but you now have to just run up to something you see, and click on it to do whatever with it.  Gameplay: Am a few hours into the game, but can say it's very much like the first. Only, better.  Combat is same, but more engaging. Also kinda harder(but I was playing on Dark/Insane difficulty.). You can meditate anywhere(no fireplaces/characters needed) that wouldn't be considered dangerous(out of battle, not in the presence of enemies). Inside or outside.  So far, the choice system is still here. I've been in situations in the game where I could, as an example, stop a crime or let it follow through. There are also sub-choices, which can sometimes be made after main choices have been made. Good/bad/etc ones are available.  EDIT:  Overall: Have since spent more hours playing the game and am enjoying it. The story is very much still that of The Witcher's, and the gameplay is very fun. Good combat, and there more options for interacting with characters you encounter than there were in last Witcher game.  The game feels like it was made on PC, which is awesome. Same as the last game. Same level of detail in the enviornments, great graphics, and doesn't feel like some technically-constrained console port.  'coughs' Skyrim 'coughs' Fallout",

            "review_text": "In general, The Witcher 2 is extremely well executed and I sincerely enjoyed nearly everything about the game (minus a few miniscule things, which I will detail)  The GOOD things:  - Plotline is superb. The Witcher 2 is based on a novel and the story is top notch quality writing. Real LOTR type stuff. - The choices you make throughout the adventure determine how the game ends. The Witcher 2 actually has 8 different endings depending on the choices you make, and these choices are actually impactful (for example, MAIN characters can live or die depending on what you do). You can easily play though this game multiple times and get a different story line/ending each time. - Characterization is probably the best I have seen in any game of this scale. It is hard not to care about what happens to the cast in this game. You either love or hate the characters because they have fully realized personalities and motives. If you consider how many main characters there are, along with all the of the different plotlines which are occurring, then this could not have been an easy feat to accomplish. - The combat system is well executed. It is not sluggish or boring and it allows you to fight in many different combat styles if you choose to do so. - The visuals in this game are simply stunning. If you compare The Witcher 2 to Skyrim, which came out within six months of eachother, The Witcher 2 blows Skyrim out of the water in terms of graphics and visuals.  The BAD things: - There is no fast travel feature. There is a lot of walking around. It's not so bad that it breaks the game, but it is quite noticeable and it begs the question of why such a simple time saving feature was not placed into the game. - Again, like in the original Witcher, you don't ever use the crafting/gold/enhancement items you collect unless you spend a lot of time and go out your way to do so. I felt like this was a big area the designers could improve on from the orignal, but it never happened.  - Some of the difficulty in the game is not quite balanced. For example the first chapter is probably the hardest one because you have zero gear or defenses and the mobs will just ♥♥♥♥ on you. As you progress and get better gear and talent points, the mobs literally become meaningless because you scale above them so drastically. Better balance was needed for sure.  Overall though, again, The Witcher 2 is excellent. The most important aspects of the game (the story and the actual combat) are executed extremely well. After playing The Witcher 2 I find it hard to believe that Skyrim received so much praise even though they were released within six months of eachother. The main thing Skyrim has over Witcher 2 is better character combat/thieving customization, but the story and characters in Skyrim are just horrendous. I suppose it depends on what you are looking for in a game.The Witcher 2 takes about 20 hours to finish.

But in The Witcher 2 everything is much deeper and each quest has a unique story line, usually with multiple paths and interesting characters. It's nice that the moral decisions aren't so black and white like alot of games and leave you really pondering what you should do. So going into this game with 6 years later with no nostalgia, I can honestly say it holds up fantastically! And at the price it frequently goes for, I think it's hands down the best value there is in gaming, I can't think of a better way to spend $3. It is not open world which may be a sign of its era, but each segmented township area are so detailed and are in fact very open with so much to do, it almost feels like an open world game even though the map has specific paths laid out for you with many semi-invisible walls. You'll want to make sure you do everything you can before carrying onto the next area. Definitely can't wait to play Witcher 3, I can only imagine what I'm in for.  For the record I played through most the game with a Dualshock 4, despite what some say I find the game works very well with a controller.",

Strange and floaty combat system prevents stops dead any funhaving in the game - until you finally get proper swords, proper skills in the tree and become a glass cannon depending on protection sign spamming. Maybe it was a revelation when it came out (I recall savage fights about this vs. Dragon Age and Skyrim, also not very good games), it does not hold a candle to the combat in Souls games or Dragons Dogma.  [PRESS LMB TO CLIMB A LEDGE][PRESS LMB TO CLIMB A LEDGE][PRESS LMB TO CLIMB A LEDGE]  Story is not impressive, but I am biased against any kind of fantasy with dragons, kings and elves. Sustain a siege, collect bear asses, help peasants, make friends, woof. Yet, the world is not without bright spots: the visual design of clothes is stunning, there are several amazing setpieces and quests (Battle in the Mist, the ghost Asylum), being played and screwed by Big Game politics is refreshing (compared to world-saving plots). Wish it was a game about Letho instead (hell, most characters in the game are more interesting that Geralt).  Still, it is NOT a chore to play, can't say that I regret spending 20+ hours of videoshame time on it.",

            "review_text": "I believe this is the first game I have ever hated during the tuturoial because of its keyboard/mouse controls. I tried to play anyway, but the pleasure:frustration ratio failed to rise to tolerable. To put that in perspective, my work phone is still a flip phone on which I must type text messages. I would rather converse by text message on that phone about the 'moon back tonight' than play another combat in Witcher 2.  Others have listed the specific flaws in game play, so I don't need to. I suspect there exists a big divide in opinion between people with a controller and those without.  I played the first Witcher. Its combat mechanics were too simple to present a challenge, but the simplicity of the controls was praiseworthy. That heightened my dismay over all the keys needed during action in Witcher 2. If they couldn't make the controls better for keyboard/mouse, don't offer it; make it controller only, or at least a prominent recommendation.  The story of Witcher 1 was good enough I wanted to play this second one before trying the third. No story is worth the frustration I anticipate. There are other games more deserving of my time and patience.",

            "review_text": "This was one of the biggest disappointments i have ever had.  First off the positive things:  + Graphics got better then in witcher 1. + Main quest plot  Now for the negatives: - Journal ruined - less information than in Witcher 1 - Overall UI very clumsy  - Few and overtly boring items for swords and armor. - Graphics bugs with shadows  - Disappreaing enemies - Interface is worse than in Witcher 1, A lot of jumping, Why do i need to go into meditation mode for drinking potions?!? - Character designed very bad - Zoltan &amp; Dandilion faceless. Triss boring.  - Missing plot strings on ending - hello Roche?!? - Occasional crashes (happen on several reloads, happen on deleting several saves within the game ui) - Finsher animations often don't even fit the surroundings you are in. - Mini games ruined: A dice leaves the board - you play with a dice less (makes a lot of sense). Fighting even more easy than in witcher 1. Arm Wrestling - Keep the indicator in the bar. Really that is just rubbish - Too many quick time events overall and additionally they are not even in any way challenging. - Fighting system overhault without making it any better.  - Quick Selection mode tries to mask the absolute abscence of a good quick access system - with hotkeys - But fails. - Bugs in quest tracking - Suddenly disappearing monsters. - Steling is ok. running around with a drawn sword isnt... - Character import from witcher 1 almost useless. You dont conserve any levels or skills. Imported weapons called 'epic' but are just rubbish. - You can't put quest items that lost their use in the stash. - Logical flaws in cut scenes (e.g.: Scene: King has a bandaged head - cut - king has no bandaged head - cut - King has bandaged head again) - Stiff witcher no jumps - need to click at the right spot to make the witcher climb a ledge or a ladder - Lighting issues - overtly bright - then dark - then bright - all in the same area at the same time. - Sound issues. Sometimes sound effects / speech goes completely missing. - Decoys disapperaing on switching ti desktop and back - Sudden detail popping in (ultra settings) - Very few and pretty boring side quests.  Sure the game itself is the witcher but those points i mention just turn down the fun for me. I love the witcher 1, sure it had it's flaws as well. Yet i would have expected the second part to make some things better but overall it made bad things in witcher even worse and even killed off the good ones (e.g. the Journal or the side quests) Quest &amp; dialogs feel generic and not very intriguing to me. It feels like everything got boiled down to serve a broader mass instead of giving things more depth. Zoltan, why are you here: Oh well my marriage didn't happen. Why does the bard need to hang: Well debauchery. (Even though Dandelion is supposed to be a spy of sorts, they pick that of all reasons)  I have no idea why the game got such good ratings, to me it just feels wrong in almost any part, except the graphics upgrade. I finished the game in hope that Witcher 3 is better and i can take some of the story knowledge with me.  So if you expected sth. better than Witcher 1, I would not recommend it. If you except some anyday RPG with a decent plot and tons of technical and logical flaws, well here you go.",

The third act felt short. The game can be a little immature/mysoginistic (I enjoy a bit of ♥♥♥♥ and and sex in games, what bothered me was how a lot of the women were portrayed). And worst is that there were a lot of game elements (especially mutations) that seemed really good but were painfully under-utilized. Ultimately, even with all these issues, the game is fantastic, the combat, strategy, upgrading and crafting all felt great (I was skeptical about the potion mechanic but actually quite enjoyed the strategy and planning it added).  I would give this game a solid 8.5 / 10. It was very fun to play, and the story and roleplaying were enjoyable. I now plan to replay the game, bring up the difficulty, and maybe try some different story and upgrade paths.

There are 3 paths you can take in the game and choosing one of them in Chapter 1 impacts entire game experience which turns into replayability. Another thing is insane amount of decisions throughout the game that adds more replayability value. I chose roche's path at beginning but now I'd help Ioverth, not for the Scoia'tel but for non humans to defeat Henselts army in chapter 2.  Decisions made in Witcher 1 and 2 have crucial impact (if you import) in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. The most important thing as I have written in my Witcher 1 review, there is a lot of sex in this game. Ofc the cutscenes are bit different in taste because they show the action. Unfortunately most of it is done with 'working girls for 100 orens'. And with Triss for 'love' in Elven ruins. She's got some decent shapes here. Have I mentioned you can get to it with Succubbus too? :P  Pros: + Nice compelling fast-paced story that doesnt feature tons of fetch quests + Drastically improved gameplay over the witcher 1 + Hard gamefor newbies, even on normal + Prelude to The Witcher 3 + Insane replayability value (3 paths, lots of choices throughout the game with different consequences, steam achievments) + Lot's of sex (more than I have IRL lol) + More gambling, spectacular fightclub and armwrestling :D (it's possible to beat final wrestler without cheating in the first attempt!) + Some great moments and good sense of humor (Odrin quest anyone? xD) + Very nice graphics...  Cons:  - ... with shader oversaturation that results in flickering - atmosphere is not as good as in the Witcher 1 - Dice not as good as in Witcher 1 - almost 20 hour shorter than the Witcher 2  - loud audio in the game with bad balace because dialogues are impossible to hear sometimes (2-3 times in entie game thats it) - if you play with subtitles off, in Kaedweni camp when you interrogate Scoia'tel, Geralt and the elf switch to ancient elven language and no subtitles are avaiable to translate what they talk about - insane amout of savegames, you need a save tool to keep them in order. otherwise it will take few minutes to load selection of saves in the game  To sum things up The Witcher 2 is great game offering lots of fun but doesn't offer great atmosphere as the Witcher 1. Combat is entertaining and challanging, exploration and dialogues are fun. Missions are interesting and fast paced. Adult story, not childish stuff like DA Inquisition. NOTE: By playing Witcher 2 I have noticed that Bioware 'borrowed' some stuff like Nilfgaardian chest symbol on armor, Sun symbol that is present in Kaedweni camp that is visible at Kings section (in DA Inquisition it's main symbol of the Inquisition but looks 100% the same as W2 symbols). Circular scan with medallion has been copied&amp;pasted by Bioware to the Inquisition. 9.5/10 for The Witcher 2: Assasins of the Kings I recommend this game for everyone loving good games with good story. You will not be dissappointed. The game is worth it's full steam price but waiting for sale is also good idea. If you haven't played The Witcher 1 Enchanced Edittion I also recommend this game for you. Sequel to the game is The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.",

It's an AAA RPG with an indie soul, and a charged, exciting adventure you can really sink your teeth into, admire, and for the most part, love. From the raw technical wizardry of the engine, to tent walls rippling in the breeze and villagers running for cover when it rains, it's a game built with burning, red-raw passion and exactly one goal. To be the best RPG ever, whatever it takes.  Ultimately, it falls short of that, but not without giving it a damn good go. Over its 20-30 hours of almost relentlessly superb moments, Witcher 2 raises almost every bar it can get its hands on. It's let down by only two things: an undercooked combat system, and a story resolution that it actually hurts to watch. The rest is simply amazing, from the beautiful writing to the gorgeous visuals, meaningful choices, and a world that feels like a real place that exists beyond the game's limitations.  For fans of the first game, this shouldn't be a surprise. You don't have to have played The Witcher to get into Assassins of Kings, although expect a confusing intro if you haven't. After that, it's a brand new story, with our hero Geralt - a travelling mutant monster-hunting-swordsman-alchemist - on the run after being fingered for the death of the Temerian king he was meant to be guarding, while powerful factions try to take advantage of the post-regicide chaos. The best thing about Assassins of Kings? They only think they're in control. Really, you are. The Witcher 2 is packed to the gills with big decisions and major plot branches, and unlike most RPGs, these have consequences far beyond whether or not you get a magic karma point, a kiss from an NPC, or an extra bit of shiny loot from a treasure chest.   When the funky shaders kick in, you know the battle is Serious Business. In the opening section, for instance, you're sent to take down a traitor, Aryan La Valette. Whether you kill him in a duel or make him surrender, the game happily rumbles on. You may not even realise that talking him into giving up is a possibility. If you do, though, you meet Aryan again not long afterwards in a dungeon and join forces. If you killed him, on the other hand, there's another scene entirely, which changes the way you escape, as well as giving you more exposure to a key political faction.  The scale of the consequences of many of your choices is almost ridiculous. Chapter 1 features two completely different final acts depending on who you work with, both of them dramatic and well-produced. Chapter 2 takes this to a whole new level, offering two completely different towns depending on your earlier choice. The basic goal is the same on both sides, and they share some maps, but the characters and sub-quests and perspective are unique. Not everything splits the story this much, but even the choices that only affect dialogue or the course of single fight are effective.   'My one-sided workout is coming back to haunt me.' All this detail and ambition comes at a price, however. The Witcher 2 often feels like CD Projekt struggled to take a step back from their game, or were unwilling to bring in fresh eyes to playtest it. Quest markers and descriptions are frequently confusing, wrong, or just plain missing - very much the sort of mistake someone wouldn't notice if they already know where they were going and why. As for the plot, there's so much lore and so many factions and elements that go unexplained that it's easy to feel lost. Technically, yes, much of the information is available in expensive real-world books and in Geralt's journal, but neither is any use when you're trapped in a key conversation with no idea why everyone hates Nilfgaard, or the political implications of a Temeria/Redania pact.  On the plus side, the problems of the first games have mostly been dealt with. The Witcher 2 still has too much backtracking and too many invisible walls, but neither are on anything like the same scale as before. You don't have to buy books to complete basic missions any more. The towns are even smaller than Witcher 1's Vizima, particularly the dwarf city Vergan, but you don't bump into the same character model every five seconds. As for the infamous sex cards, they're gone, replaced with animated cutscenes full of uncensored nudity, but which are true to the characters involved and pack a decent amount of sentiment in with their gratuitous fan-service. Even in the intro, with Geralt's arm carefully positioned to frame his lover Triss's bare buttocks while she sleeps, it's not subtle, but it works.  Most importantly, while the opening chapters of the first game practically defied you to actually play them, The Witcher 2 hits the ground running, with huge armies clashing, dragon attacks, daring escapes, and an opening village full of drama and intrigue and interesting moral dilemmas. Lessons have been learned, and learned well, across the board. At least, for the most part...   'Touché?' The new combat system is a more mixed bag. As before, the gimmick is that you use a steel sword against humans, a silver one against monsters, along with several simple magic spells to stun, burn and otherwise tip the balance in your favour. Between fights, you mix magic potions to adjust your stats in various directions, and lay down traps. Instead of pointing and selecting like before though, every attack is a direct interaction with the game: mouse-clicks for fast and slow strikes, and hotkeys to hurl magic and bombs, parry attacks and roll. This works well against one or two opponents at once, but a mix of long, non-interruptible animations and bad targeting can make fighting groups a pain.  Oddly, this is especially problematic early on, when Geralt has almost no stamina, his spells are weak, you can't block more than a couple of hits at a time, rear attacks deal 200% damage, and you can easily be obliterated by random encounters. Many early skills aren't about making Geralt a better fighter but stopping him being a crap one. This means that combat can be much harder at the start of the first chapter than anywhere else in the game, with little sense of escalation outside of specific boss fights.   Going to need a silver-ier sword. Playing on Easy, this is never a problem - the enemies practically beat themselves up. I played on Normal, and after the first few levels, most combat quickly became trivial. I kept a bag of basic Swallow potions on hand, and rarely bothered with anything else unless I was fighting a boss. A couple of sword upgrades mixed with hefty use of the Aard (stun) and Quen (shield) spells dealt with everything, even before unlocking the special 'I Win' group execution attacks during Chapter 2. In fairness, there are harder difficulty modes available, but I never felt tempted to switch to them. The combat was OK, but it was firmly the story, and spitting in the faces of kings and demons alike, that kept me going.  Which, tragically, is where things went wrong. Just an hour before the credits rolled, I had The Witcher 2 pencilled in for 92%. Great game. Some annoyances, but drowned out by the good stuff. Chapter 1 was glorious, beautiful, involving and heartfelt. Chapter 2 was even better: epic, dramatic, amazing. When I hit Chapter 3, it felt like the game-changing mid-point, where the gloves would come off and the second half of the story absolutely explode into life in a flurry of fire and steel.   The combat is fun, but the story is the main attraction. It wasn't. Chapter 3 turned out to be the end, as if The Witcher 2 suddenly looked at its watch, and went 'Whoa, is that the time?'. Things are resolved... mostly... but in the most cack-handed ways. Plot threads are unceremoniously dumped, characters sidelined and forgotten, a couple of final quests rushed through as quickly as possible, and then the word 'Epilogue' appears like a slap in the face. Huge, world-changing events",

And while you would have thought that better character tree (three separate branches of character development) would deliver better outcome that the first Witcher, it's all irrelevant due to absolutely batshit crazy input lag and lack of direct control over your character. Every move you make, every swing you try to do needs about 0,5-1 second until it's actually performed. You don't really have control on which attack you will actually perform. Will it be a single swing? A pirouette? A chained attack? ♥♥♥♥ you, prepare for a surprise and a possible ♥♥♥♥ up of getting mauled to death by a bunch of monsters if your character decides to perform a fancy attack with jumping and rolling. You can't even cancel your moves, I mean, the ♥♥♥♥ is this ♥♥♥♥? Your ripostes will not activate at random, hey enjoying that 1/3 hp hit already because of some script hicup or other ♥♥♥♥? On a top of that add a really console-centring UI with awful feel on PC. Drinking a single potion is a chore. And this game needs you to care about drugs all the time, so you will enter meditation over and over again (because potions' duration times are significantly nerfed). The animations and transitions between game screens takes more time that the actual draggin potions to drink them. If you decide to delve into an awful crafting system (don't do it), you will start to rip your hairs pretty fast, since the awful auto-aim makes every looting of crates piled one on another a real pain in the ♥♥♥. Are you trying to take just specific ingredients from this pile of chests in somebody's house? Tthere's no thievery system by the way and everyone will be happy for you robbing them from everything they've got - enjoying your immersive story telling yet? Well ♥♥♥♥ you, just take them all together and sell the rest to a vendor for 10 coins for half of your inventory capacity. Also, never do a precise granade/knife aiming, since you will miss 90% of the time, even the knife just went through the guy's head.

I couldn't stop playing for about five hours. The graphics are pretty good, along with very smooth controls. The only thing that could be improved is the magic. There are about seven or so keys that you press to switch magic. I find that having a 'quick switch,' between magics, would be helpful. The main protagonist, Geralt, is bad-a**. Looking at the scars all over his body, you can tell that he can handle himself in a fight. The antagonist is very intimidating. He's basically a wall of meat.

            "review_text": "The Witcher franchise, as a whole, has garnered rather favorable reception from critics, with its apex widely considered to be the recently released Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt. Now, I personally have strayed from the Witcher franchise for no particular reason, just a general disinterest I suppose. I enjoy the fantasy genre and RPGs, so why wouldn’t the Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings be able to saunter onto my radar and come out being considered a fantastic piece of game? Well, with over 23 hours of this game under my belt, I have many choice words for this games favor, as well as many for is developers to mull over.  The first thing that you notice and will eventually salivate over is how great this game actually looks, especially how color filled it is. Thankfully The Witcher 2 has fallen prey to the better side of gamings trend toward better graphics without having everything doused in dank browns and greys like many other titles. You’ll often just sit back and enjoy what a visual spectacle that has been prepared for you, hair swaying, tassels bouncing on the character, flora flowing with the winds; everything blends together to make such a believable visual style that manages to remain all its own. In terms of graphical and aesthetic prowess, The Witcher 2 can stand toe to toe with any of the next gen releases, and even come out on top in many areas.  While the game is very pretty, the story, while set in world of rich history and believability, leaves much to be desired. Maybe it is because I lack the investment from the first game, but the stakes never feel like they should. I mean, further down the line your to repel a ♥♥♥♥ing invasion; the unfortunate thing being is that the whole thing is turned into essentially Horde mode, beat one wave after another to progress in the story. I mean this happens a lot in many situations if not all, this “kill everyone to progress to the next level” mentality. Even when you kill a ♥♥♥♥ING DRAGON, the thing is easier than the first boss in the ♥♥♥♥ING GAME. The characters also feed into this tone, as, while the voice actors try, I kinda get the feeling they were only performing at half their capacity as they don’t pump the player for any major plot events as they should.  Still, even if the the events of the story lack weight, the decisions do. Im sure if you were to replay the game again, the decisions would feel less dynamic and spontaneous, but that's what they felt like. As if I could’ve chosen a different path and wildly change the outcome of things, creating a real tension when you do have to make these choices. Some are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t though, like when you are given the choice to help someone who busted you from prison or give a sword to someone who is aiding you tracking a kingslayer, with the ultimate decision having either character you chose tag along with you the rest of the game. Still, while story lackluster, the decisions are weight filled and consequential, to a tad of a fault in some instances.  Combat is a mixed bag. First, praise should be given to how layered it is, as you could increase damage dealt with various oils, potions and trophies. This kind of complexity will be sure to get you out of a tight jam more than you realize, especially early game. While layered, this complexity seems to become irrelevant later down the line, as you’ll have more powerful equipment that will compensate the damage you couldn’t deal prior, at earlier levels. Magic is also thrown into the mix, but with mixed results as you will make the most use out of one, Aarnd, which essentially force pushes opponents. Despite how seeming layered the combat is, I hate how the leveling system is incredibly lopsided, favoring basic melee attacks over the other mechanics. The melee combat is still rather good, though a little variance in leveling would be nice, as alchemy and magic become underutilized in late game, hurting you more than you think.  Complementing the combat was the surprising amount of enemy variety. You got scores of different monsters and scores of different types of men to fight. You’ll face harpies, knights, zombie-like things, crossbowmen, insectoids, and much much more. Each enemy has specific fighting patterns you can utilize to your advantage or suffer for naught, it all feels very dynamic and satisfying when you blow through a horde with only sliver of you life bar remaining. Bosses are a bit anticlimactic though. There was this huge build up a some point to fight this giant fire demon, who died in like ten hits. I wish more challenge was brought here as with the other enemies.  So, is The Witcher 2 a good game? Yes. Is it the best RPG I’ve ever played? No. While much of the game is rather great, and it presents itself rather well, these little minor hindrances here and there bring down what could’ve been a rather fantastic game. If these problems were fixed, maybe this game would rank highly with me, easily one of my favorite games of all time even. But sadly, that isn’t the case.   Verdict   7/10  Good",
