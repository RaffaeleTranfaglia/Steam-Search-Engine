            "review_text": "Half-Life 2. The video game that started the modern generation on first-person shooters and revamped the gaming history into a new era. Originally released in November 2004, the game won multiple game of the year awards and branched gameplay mechanics, including physics and the state-of-the-art game engine that look realistic during its release date. Many people are aware on the game’s popularity and everlasting legacy including various jokes on the awaiting sequel (for many years), but the question remains: Why is this game popular?  The game takes place after the events from Half-Life. You play as Gordon Freeman, the silent protagonist who got a Ph.D. on theoretical physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and knows how to use weapons very effectively; a strange paradox for a character with such features yet highly popular and well-recognized. You are sent to City 17 by the G-Man, a mysterious person or a phenomenon with a mysterious and ambiguous agenda, to overthrow Wallace Breen and the alien oppressors, the Combine. The setting and lore in the Half-Life universe is simply the best, taking some influence from George Orwell’s 1984 or other famous dystopian novels to set the story in tone. Gordon’s influence and previous actions will spark oppressed citizens in City 17 to take arms and revolt against the Combine. From City 17 to the prison at Nova Prospekt, each setting is unique, bleak, but beautifully designed, the game simply defined what a video game should be.   Each NPCs and major characters such as Doctor Issac Kleiner, Barney Calhoun, and other characters interact realistically among each other and to you. In regards to Alyx Vance, your ally and companion, Valve spawned the concept of AI teammates and became a true asset in your journey to rally up the oppressed citizens. Besides good character developments, the best attribute for Half-Life 2 was physic interactions and the game engine. The game engine is Source, which feature high-dynamic range rendering, facial animations, and “realistic physics”; the first game that had such a feature like this.   Are there criticisms for the game? I believe so, but to be honest, I couldn’t find any legitimate criticisms for the game. If one criticism has to be addressed, then the problem is the loading sections. Yes, those tedious loading that interrupted the “flow” in the middle of a long level or after finishing a series of firefights against Civil Protection or Combine forces. These loading or “checkpoints” really halt the immersion in the game. However, this is very common on all Half-Life games and I hope that Valve would address this (if they are working on the sequel…).   Half-Life 2 is pure gold, shining flawlessly on the test of time. With great graphical fidelity at its time, voice acting and realistic AI interaction from your allies and enemies, this game is a rare exception of genuine perfection and grand role model for other game developers to pursue their own game designs. The only thing Half-Life 2 (and its episodes) is a full fledge sequel. Besides many jokes, anxieties, and waning patience for Valve to announce the sequel, the game should be in every PC gamer’s Steam library. No exception. Half-Life 2 is simply the best; a grand overture that started and defined the modern gaming industry in the present time.  ",

            "review_text": "John Freeman who was Gordon Freemans brother was one day in an office typing on a computer. He got an email from his brother that said that aliens and monsters were attacking his place and aksed him for help so he went. John Freeman got his computer shut down and wet on the platform to go up to the roof of the building where he left his motorcycle and normal people close because he was in his office lab coat. John Freeman got on his motorcycl and said 'its time for me to live up to my family name and face full life consequences' so he had to go. John Freeman ramped off the building and did a backflip and landed. He kept driving down the road and made sure there was no zombies around because he ddint have weapon. The contrysides were nice and the plants were singing and the birds and the sun was almost down from the top of the sky. the mood was set for John Freemans quest to help his brother where he was. John Freeman looked around the countrysides and said 'its a good day to do what has to be done by me and help my brother to defeat the enemys'. John Freeman was late so he had to drive really fast. A cop car was hiden near by so when John Freeman went by the cops came and wanted to give him a ticket. Here John Freeman saw the first monster because the cop was posessed and had headcrabs. 'I cant give you my lisense officer' John Freeman said 'Why not?' said the headcrab oficer back to John Freeman. 'Because you are headcrab zombie' so John Freeman shot the oficer in the head and drove off thinking 'my brother is in trouble there' and went faster. John Freeman had to go faster like the speed of sound and got there fast because Gordon needed him where he was. John Freeman looked at road signs and saw 'Ravenholm' with someons writing under it saying 'u shudnt come here' so John Freeman almost turned around but heard screaming like Gordon so he went faster again. John Freeman drove in and did another flip n jumped off his motorbike and the motor bike took out some headcrab zombies infront of John Freeman. John Freeman smiled and walked fast. John Freeman then looked on the ground and found wepon so he pickd it up and fired fast at zombie goasts in front of a house. John Freeman said 'Zombie goasts leave this place' and the zombie goasts said 'but this is our house' and John Freeman felt sorry for them becaus they couldnt live there anymore because they were zombie goasts so he blew up the house and killed the zombie goasts so they were at piece. Then John Freeman herd another scream from his brother so he kept walking really faster to get where he was. Ravenholdm was nothing like the countrysides there was no birds singing and the pants were dead and teh dirt was messy and bloody from headcrabs. When John Freeman got to where the screaming was started from he found his brother Gorden Freeman fightin the final bosss and Gordon said 'John Freeman! Over here!' so John Freeman went there to where Gordon Freeman was fighting. John Freeman fired his bullet from teh gun really fast and the bullets went and shot the final boss in the eyes and the final boss couldnt see. Gordon Freeman said 'its time to end this ones and for all!' and punched the final boss in the face and the final boss fell. John Freeman said 'thanks i could help, bro' and Gordon Freeman said 'you should come here earlier next time' and they laughed. The laughed overed quickly though because John Freeman yelled 'LOOK OUT BRO!' and pointed up to the top of the sky. Gordon Freeman looked up and said 'NOO! John Freeman run out of here fast as you can!' and John Freeman walked real fast out. John Freeman loked back and saw Gordon get steppd on by the next boss and he was mad and angry. 'I'll get you back evil boss!' John Freeman yelled at the top of lungs. to be continued..?",

            "review_text": "'Rise and shine,Mr. Freeman,rise and shine'- G-man Half-Life 2 is the sequel to Half-Life,the game by Valve that pretty much wrote the rules for FPSs way back in 1998. I haven't played very much of this game myself,but I can guarantee that anyone who plays it will end up loving this game,even those that didn't play HL1 before playing this game(like me).   The plot: Gordon Freeman is brought out of stasis by the G-Man,who inserts him in a train arriving at the fictitous City 17,which was taken over by Combine forces. He eludes the Combine forces and meets Alyx and Barney,and joins the Lambda Resistance. He gets to Dr. Kleiner's lab and assists them in attempting to get a teleporter to teleport him and Alyx to Dr. Eli Vance's lab. The teleportation fails,and he goes through City 17 on foot to get to Eli's lab. He arrives at Black Mesa East and meets up with Eli, where he is captured and taken to a combine prison,Nova Prospekt. Gordon goes through a zombie infested town named Ravenholm and is given a Dune Buggy,which he uses to travel to Nova Prospekt. Eli,Alyx,and Gordon escape,the combine teleporter they used exploding in the process. Gordon and Alyx learn they were in a 'slow teleport'during which a week has passed. In their absence,the Resistance mobilized against the combine, turning City 17 into a battleground. Alyx is captured by the Combine and taken to the Citadel,with Gordon,aided by Barney and D0g,goes to the Citadel. He gets caught in a Combine'confiscation chamber',which destroys all of his weapons except for the Gravity Gun,the energy enhancing it's capabilities and turning it into a superior weapon. He is captured riding in a Combine transport pod and is taken to Dr. Breen's office,where he is holding Eli and Alyx captive. Breen explains his plans for further conquest of the humans by the Combine. Breen tries to escape through a portal,but Gordon destroys the portal reactor with the super-charged Gravity Gun. Breen is annihilated in the resulting explosion,but just before Gordon and Alyx get killed,time is frozen,and the G-Man appears,praising Gordon for his actions in City 17 and the Citadel,and puts Gordon back into stasis.   The characters are pretty cool,even if some of the characters can tend to be annoying*looks at Barney*  The music is pretty cool,tho the game mostly relies on ambiance.  The weapons are pretty good,just really your standard FPS weapons,except the Gravity Gun is added,which lets you move almost any object at will. Heck,you get a crowbar also x) :)  This is an amazing game overall,it seriously deserves the critical acclaim that it's gotten,and I HIGHLY recommend this game,even to those that haven't played Half-Life before,it's def worth the 10 bucks 10/10 from me :)",

            "review_text": "Half-Life 2 (stylized as HλLF-LIFE2) is a first-person shooter video game and the sequel to Half-Life (1998). Developed by Valve Corporation, it was released on November 16, 2004, following a five-year $40 million development, during which a substantial part of the project was leaked and distributed on the Internet. The game was developed alongside Valve's Steam software. It introduced the Source game engine and, because of Steam, was the first single-player video game to require online product activation.  Some years after the events of Half-Life, protagonist Gordon Freeman is woken by the enigmatic G-Man to find the world has been taken over by the alien Combine. Joined by allies including resistance fighter Alyx Vance, Gordon searches for a way to free humanity using a variety of weapons, including the object-manipulating gravity gun.  Like its predecessor, Half-Life 2 received critical acclaim. It was praised for its advanced physics, animation, sound, AI, graphics, and narrative. The game won 39 'Game of the Year' awards and the title of 'Game Of The Decade' at the 2012 Spike Video Game Awards, and is widely considered to be one of the greatest and most important video games of all time. Over 6.5 million copies of Half-Life 2 were sold at retail by December 3, 2008, (not including Steam sales); as of February 9, 2011, Half-Life 2 had sold over 12 million copies. Like its predecessor, Half-Life 2 is a single-player first-person shooter broken into several chapters, permanently casting the player as the protagonist Gordon Freeman. The sequel has nearly the same mechanics as Half-Life, including health-and-weapon systems and periodic physics puzzles, except with the newer Source Engine and improved graphics. The player also starts without items, slowly building up an arsenal over the course of the game. Despite the game's mainly linear nature, much effort was put into making exploration rewarding and interesting; many optional areas can be missed or avoided.  A diverse set of enemies is present, which usually require being approached with different tactics: some coordinate in groups to out-maneuver or out-position the player; others, like the Manhack, fly directly at the player through small openings and tight corridors; still others use predictable but powerful attacks, while others hide before swiftly attacking the player. Gordon can kill most enemies with his weapons, or make use of indirect means, exploiting environmental hazards such as explosive pressurized canisters, gas fires or improvised traps. For some portions of the game, Gordon can be joined by up to four armed Resistance soldiers and medics, and can send his team further from him or call them back.  Many of the game's new features utilize its detailed physics simulation. Two sections of the game involve driving vehicles. Instead of button-based puzzles from Half-Life, environmental puzzles are also introduced with makeshift mechanical systems, revolving around the player's new ability to pick up, move, and place objects. Solutions involve objects' physical properties, such as shape, weight, and buoyancy. For example, in Chapter 3, Route Kanal, the player is required to stack cinder blocks on a makeshift see-saw ramp to proceed over a wall. Alternatively, the player can use these to build a crude staircase, so sometimes, multiple approaches lead to the desired outcome.  Part-way through the game, Gordon acquires the Gravity Gun, which allows him to draw distant objects towards himself or forcefully push them away, as well as the ability to manipulate larger and heavier objects that he cannot manipulate without the weapon. These abilities are required to solve puzzles later in the game, and can also be used to great effect in combat, as any non-static object within proximity to the player has the potential to be used as a makeshift defense (e.g. a file cabinet) or a deadly projectile (e.g. a gasoline can or a buzzsaw blade).  The game never separates the player with pre-rendered cutscenes or events; the story proceeds via exposition from other characters and in-world events, and ensures that the player controls Gordon for the entirety of the game. Much of the backstory to the game is simply alluded to, or told through the environment.Half-Life 2 presents a dystopian alternate history of Earth, where the resources of the planet, including the human race itself, are being harvested by an oppressive multidimensional empire, known as the Combine. The game is set around the fictitious City 17, roughly 20 years after the events of its predecessor Half-Life.  During Half-Life, the scientists, including Gordon Freeman, at the Black Mesa Research Facility, accidentally caused an inter-dimensional instability known as a resonance cascade and later as the 'Black Mesa Incident', when an experiment on an alien crystal sample went wrong.[1] Alien creatures, such as the Vortigaunts and headcrabs, from the borderworld of Xen, flooded into the facility. Gordon fought his way through them and the government cover-up response combat units, making it to the Facility's Lambda Complex. There, the Lambda scientists helped Gordon teleport to Xen, where Gordon destroyed a large alien entity keeping the rift open. Gordon was then suddenly extracted by the mysterious G-Man, who had been watching Gordon over the course of the game. Impressed with his ability to survive against all odds, the G-Man offered him a job before placing him into stasis, which Gordon had no option but to accept.  Some time after the ending of Half-Life, the instability at Black Mesa had attracted the attention of the Combine empire, and they invaded Earth. Humanity surrendered at the conclusion of the resulting 'Seven Hour War'. City 17 became the home of the gigantic Combine Citadel, and Dr. Wallace Breen, the Administrator of Black Mesa who had negotiated the surrender, was appointed representative and Administrator to supervise the survivors on behalf of the Combine.[2] Unable to breed due to a Combine suppression field, humanity matured. The Combine implemented a brutal police state of Civil Protection officers and Overwatch soldiers by recruiting and biologically assimilating humans and other species. Meanwhile, an underground 'Lambda Resistance' of humans and Vortigaunts, now working together, was formed. This saw Freeman as a saviour who would lead them to freedom.20 years after the Resonance Cascade, the Combine emerge from the portal with advanced technologies, enabling them to conquer the world in 7 hours. Gordon Freeman is brought out of stasis by the G-Man, who inserts him into a train arriving at City 17.[3] After arriving at the station and eluding Combine forces, Gordon joins Lambda resistance members including Barney Calhoun, a former Black Mesa security guard now working undercover as a Combine CP officer, and Alyx Vance, the daughter of one of Gordon's former colleagues, Dr. Eli Vance. After a failed attempt to teleport to Eli's resistance base known as Black Mesa East from Dr. Kleiner's makeshift laboratory in City 17, Gordon, re-equipped with the HEV suit and a crowbar, is forced to progress on foot through the city's old canal system. After obtaining an airboat, he battles his way to Black Mesa East, several miles from the city.[4][5]  Gordon is reintroduced to Eli and meets another resistance scientist, Dr. Judith Mossman.[6] Alyx introduces Gordon to her pet robot D0g and gives him a 'gravity gun', an instrument which allows Gordon to easily pick up and move large objects. Black Mesa East comes under Combine attack, and Eli and Mossman are taken to a Combine prison, Nova Prospekt. Separated from Alyx, Gordon takes a detour through the zombie-infested town of Ravenholm with help from its last survivor, Father Grigori. After making his way through the town and a mine, Gordon arrives at a Resistance outpost. He uses a customized dune buggy to travel across a crumbling coastal road to Nova Prospekt.",

Pros - Looks great even today while on max settings - Interesting world with great characters - Cool yet Creepy alien bad guys :The Combine - Simple, effective controls - Good variety of everything (enemies, weapons, locations etc.) - Length: HL2+Ep1+Ep2= 20hrs+ easily in one playthrough - Fixes all gamplay issues I had with HL1 - Great pacing and difficulty curve - Some of the best sound design and music in videogames - Fun, pure simple fun!  Cons - First person driving isn't great - Too easy on normal (always play on hard) for me anyway - Ending feels too sudden and unsatisfying without Ep1 and Ep2 (seriously get Orange Box!) - Needs at least 2 or 3 more guns - Enemies are a bit too easy to kill - AI squad just gets in the way - Some minor bugs and glitches All very minor things  If you love shooters you should get this as soon as possible",

This game was the bomb when it came out in 2004 and it is still known as one of the best FPS games on the market but this game has a huge bit of history behind it when Valve finished Half-Life 1 they wanted to make a sequel right away but in 2003 after the E3 showcase of the game an ANON German hacker had leaked the files onto the internet and at the time the game was virtually unplayable. This also leaked some CSS BETA content and TF2 ALPHA content but this was one of the biggest thefts at the time and it will stand out in gaming history for a long time and it will always be with the people that have lived through 2003. Finally in 2004 this game was released to the general public with an outstanding physics engine, astonishing shader detail, a jampacked level editor in the files and daziling facial posing NOW can you see why this game is defined as a classic.

Best way to buy it is through the Orange Box, not just do you get Half-LIfe 2 but also Episode One and Two, plus portal. An action packed game with great moments such as entering the Citadel and getting the Super-Charged Zero Point Energy Field Manipulator, or dashing through Ravenholm.  Earth in this time of story has been taken over by Combine forces, but Half-Life isn't one to tell you the story uphand, that can be found with uncovering the deeper story.  No time for cut-scences, well there aren't any but that's okay as it keeps you being the Gordon Freeman, it realy does imerse you in the game. Not just comat based based but also Physics too, with some here and there small Physcis puzzles. Later in the game as you progress, gather more weapons and more harder Combine enemies hunt you down you can take control of Antlion insects (something that was once an anoying enemy) and members of the Resistance (People like you who are trying take back Earth and their lives).  Throwing and shooting explosive barrels is aways fun. Weapons of Crowbar and Gravity Gun, Glock and Magnum, SMG and Pulse Riffle (both have alt shots), Shotgun and Crossbow, and Grenades and RPG. There are two veichles in which you'll encounter in the game, the Boat and Buggy, personally I never liked the Boat and Water Hazard is one of my least liked chapters in the game, but the Buggy is pretty cool. There are boss battles (if you would call them that) from Hunter-Choppers, Gunships, Striders and Antlion Guards. Over coming these challanges is always an amazing thrill. Each place is always destinctively different and fun.  The main problem I have with this game is that even with all this action, a lot of it at times felt a bit samey, but that is dealt with costant upgrade of tools and weapons. Another fault with the game (Both are fixed in Episode One and Two) is that you never seem to stay in one place, always constantly moving from a-b and no c, even though places are memerable.  An amazing classic game and experience, with a rich story and lore. I loved it, if this is your first FPS (doesn't count only online ie. Counter Strike or TF2) then thats okay too as it was my first one, more amazingness then flaws, still holding up today in our modern day (Still doesn't have Valve's HDR) gameplay and graphicaly, a game that most FPS inspire too, the amazing, Half-Life 2. A must have, a must buy. Make sure you also get Episode One and Two (they are expansions), and best way to buy is through the Orange Box.  In short words, an amazing Sci-Fi FPS and in all an amazing game, but not as good as it's sequals, amazing. You need to play this game.",

I believe this game aged well and it looks good even today which marks the 10-year anniversary of this game. Valve later on released some updates to the Source Engine so the game support widescreen and has some extra features to make it look and run better.  Story-wise it is an excellent follow-up to the first game as now we have an alien race called Combine who have already invaded and enslaved humanity. Freeman - our numb protagonist - is now tasked with aiding those people who rose up to defy these visitors from space. While some of the creatures we encountered in the first episode return in Half Life 2 you mainly fight against humanoid-like creatures. It's a nice touch and it also showcases the artificial intelligence which is also superb in the game.  There are varied environments in the game and there are two things that keep you interested throughout your progress: occasionally you can hop into a vehicle and drive to your next destination. Early on you cannot access this car but you can use a boat to go through a sewers-like stage. The second - and probably best - feature of the game is the Gravity Gun. A gun that does not have ammunition and requires objects - objects in your surroundings that you can pick up and launch at your enemies. There is a level specifically designed for this weapon; a level where ammo is a scarcity and you rely on the precision-aiming skill with the gravity gun.  Single-player campaign offers a long (10-15 hour) experience and the game has two expansion packs (the two provide you with roughly 8-9 hours gameplay time). While Episode 1 is a bit of a letdown Episode 2 is an excellent expansion pack.  I wish Valve concluded the story of Gordon Freeman with releasing a final episode (Episode 3) or a 3rd sequel. I believe this request - coming from not just me but from the community - is well justified.",

            "review_text": "Half-Life 2 is , in my opinion, one of the best shooter games released in 2000s for PC. It begins with our protagonist, Gordon Freeman, arriving at City 17 via train , which is really awkward because Half-Life 1's story ended with him waking up in front of the G-Man, then being teleported to various places, mostly filled with aliens, and forced to accept G-Man's offer knowing that he has no chance of winning in a battle against him. The first chapter of the story continues with Gordon facing Civil Protection officers and later getting into chapter 2 by meeting a woman, named Alyx Vance, daughter of Eli Vance, a former Black Mesa employee now leading the Resistance against the Combine, who is going to introduce our protagonist to the Black Mesa East where will be teleported to work alongside Alyx and other scientists. But the teleportation failed due to the interruption from Kleiner's pet headcrab, Lamarr, which caused a malfunction in the teleporter leading Gordon to Dr.Breen's office, which recognizes him as a threat and puts the Combine forces on alert, so now his only option is to go on foot through the old Canals, with Civil Protection officers in hot pursuit but not before being given a crowbar by Barney. So, if you want to know how the story will continue, how Gordon's journey will be, you'll have to buy the game and play it yourself because it has a great story, which gets you excited and mind-captivated. It can truly be called a masterpiece of it's time which I strongly recommend.",

I remember when I bought the Orange Box on PS3 I was just amazed! 5 years later replaying it on PC it just adds to the amazing quality of the game. I loved every single second of it and is one my most favorite games of all time. Half Life 2 is a tense, thrilling, and all around amazing game that should be played by everyone.  NOT FOR: People who don't like FPS's. I would still recommend trying it out, but if that's not really your thing, I don't think Half Life 2 would change your mind all that much. However keep in mind that this is more of an old school first person shooter, unlike say Call of Duty. This game doesn't tell you where to go or how to get there, maybe not as much as the original Half-Life, but still a far cry from the crazy hand holding a lot of modern games have today.  FOR: People who want to play or try out a different stlye of FPS. This is not Call of Duty. No constant checkpoints or arrows showing you where to go. While this may prove frustrating for some...(It was for me the first time I tried it.) It proves to be extremely rewarding. On a other note this game doesn't have regenerating health which up's the challenge factor considerably. Even on easy you can every easily die if you don't react fast enough.   IN CONCLUSION: I hope this review finds you well and if you want some other games like Half Life 2, make sure to get it's sequels Episode 1 &amp; 2 . Also try out Portal and Portal 2 as they are in the same universe. (The Portal series is a puzzle game so it's different, but it's in the same story universe.) Lastly play the originaly it'll be worth it.",

Of course this was my second FPS experience after Portal so having an actual gun this time around was new for me. I could go on for hours about how wonderful this game is. It's got humour, excitment, danger, freaky monster zombie crabs and holy cow those things sound awful.   Helpful tip: Don't play Ravenholm at 4AM.",

I couldn't put a finger on whether it was the immersive storyline, the combat, the soundtrack (plenty of the scores I can't stop listening to on YouTube), the overwhelming graphics (judging it is a 2004 game), the scenery and exploration. The list just goes on. Whatever combination of things to fight - combine, headcrab zombies, antlions - it will at some point or another feature such a scene. It never disappoints. You're taken to a vast spectrum of places, with puzzles and combat and inertia to sustain your interest. Finally, without trying to be so, it feels more personal an experience; and yet the only thing Valve did to allow this to happen was to not feature the image of Gordon Freeman or give him a voice throughout the epic (which it pulls off perfectly where games as, say, Skyrim or Saint's Row, always give that impression that it isn't you playing, but someone you designed: that is nothing on how HL2 ensures there's no middle medium between you and the game (the gem of Valve)). Consequently, it gave the sense of reading a novel, with plenty of replayability, not to mention value for money. To this day, whenever I think back to it, I feel those exact same chills, goosebumps and emotions as if I were playing it right now. This review doesn't do it justice. What a game, simply.",

First off, you do not need to have played the first half life to appreatate this one, and in fact the first time I played HL2, I barely even knew what the first one was about. The dystopian setting has always been one of my favorites, and this game protrays this perfectly. Everything in the game seems as if it is barely working and is about to fall apart. Although the game is now nearly 10 years old, its graphics still look pleasing, and the art style is as amazing as always. The level variety is stunning, and thoughout the ten hour campagin, it never begins to become boring. The characters feel like people, and you begin to genuinely care about them. Each weapon feels unique, and I ended up using almost all of them at one point or another. (Something I think they improved over Half Life 1) This game is basically created Steam, so please buy this wonderful game! And if this game doesnt sound interesting to you, there are litterally hundreads of mods, so almost as great as the orginal game. There is no reason not to buy this game, though if you have the money, get the Orange Box for sure, as it has much more value.   Pros: +Story +Gameplay +Characters +Physics +Litterally everything  Neutral: *No multiplayer (But it doesnt need it)  Overall: 10/10 I love this game, and have played though it about four times. I can find nearly no flaws, please buy this game, you have no idea what you are missing.",

Half Life 2.2004.No wonder why so many reviewers call it a masterpiece.A game with a really strong plot,atmosphere,and mystery.Some people disagree with the Developers who call it an Action-Adventure,and they say that HL2 is a Horror FPS.Well,who cares,as long as you enjoy it,right.Personally,i loved it,this game had some creepy moments,and easter eggs,for example the voices from the Crub Zombies,and the Gman himself.i ended this game in 15 hours,on normal difficulty,without rushing.    Gameplay : 8/10   Half Life 2 is an FPS Action-Adventure game,broken in 14 chapters/parts.There are many optional/hidden areas which are very rewarding,and some of them contain easter eggs.There's a variety of enemies,from Aliens and Zombies,to Soldiers with gadgets.Sometimes,Gordon Freeman (You) becomes the captain of a group,which contain people who want to help you.In Several areas,Gordon drives his Scout Car which is very useful in long roads,or when you are surrouned by enemies,since it possesses 2 machine guns with infinity ammo.HL2 has a collection of weapons,YOUR POWERFUL CROWBAR(pistols/submachineguns/shotguns/sniper(?),a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ball who controlls several insects,and you can use them to raise your army,and of course,the gravity gun,a weapon you use to drag/throw objectives,which is pretty hitlarious.

Freeman is thrust into the unenviable role of rescuing the world from the wrong he unleashed back at Black Mesa. And a lot of people he cares about are counting on him.     Graphics : 10/10   Half Life 2 was Released in 2004.10 years before,and this game got stunning graphics.i mean seriously,VALVe made an excelent job with this.Amazing Shaders and Atmosphere.

It also leaves you feeling like a badass sometimes, taking down gunships. This isn't just a run and shoot game, it's a puzzle. You sometimes might be sitting in this one area for 20 minutes or so, playing around with plugs and gears. The gravity gun is very fun too, it gives you many ways to kill the 'zombies' that roam around. I found myself picking up random objects from a chinese food container to a big saw to see what would kill them. You might also play around and experiment with the amazing Source Engine that Half Life 2 runs on. This was a short review, but trust me when I say this, it is worth the $10 you pay.",

A wide variety of foes that range in difficulty and many weapons that if used correctly vanquish any foe, the game serves as the basis for Counter Strike, a popular multiplayer FPS, and gives an excellent example for what can be called a 'variety'.

Gordon finds his beloved planet invaded by an inter-dimensional alien race called the Combine, humans are inslaved or made into political or military puppets. Gordon finds himself working with his old Black Mesa friends as a Resistance to put an end to the Combine.  . In this game you will find yourself: . Killing well-designed enemies, from Alien humanoids to parasitic creatures like the Headcrab. . Navigate through well-made levels that include action-inducing chaos and automobile stunts. . Cry out tears as you see your beloved Earth inslaved by foreign persons. . Love Alyx. . Chuck your everyday items at ultra speed to cut a Zombie's throat. . Disintergrate enemies, and even throw them!  It also includes:  . Half-Life 2 Deathmatch which provides hours of fun with family and friends. . The Source-SDK if you are interested in making your own levels. . A reason to not go outside.  But as with every game, there should be some things in the game that arn't 'perfect' so I'll put in my 2 cents. If you are a maniac in your own right, you will not be really fond of the parts of the game when there is a physics-puzzle. Now don't get me wrong, I love these parts of the game, but to some of you, you may not like it. You could even get stuck in a level and it could take hours to figure out how to solve them to continue if you arn't going to cheat or use walkthroughs or even ask your friend (I personaly find it f***ing annoying when friends ask me how to pass a level'.  But don't worry. Half-Life 2 is a great game, it is worth your money and your time.",

Running on the Source engine a revolutionary Physics engine that allows for limitless possablities of creative gameplay choices &amp; fun, it is quite possibly the greatest First Person Shooter ever made, but it has shown a tad bit of age in some areas of the game. Not only did it set the graphics standards for over 10 years, but it is a testement to how they STILL hold up today.  Now people say Half-Life 2 is over-rated. But they're idiots. They only play up until the 5th mission, which goes n a bit long, &amp; they say 'It's only driving sections &amp; it's boring, it shouldn't recieve all this aclaim' So I say: Those people can go ***** themselves, because 10 years old, &amp; Half-Life 2 is STILL one of the best First Person Shooters EVER MADE in recent years.  To this day, Video games try to have awesome graphics &amp; realistic gameplay, &amp; innovation. But what this REALLY means, is 'We are trying to catch up to the standards of VALVe.  Half-Life 2 is one of the best games EVER &amp; a testoment to how well VALVe is the best videogame company on the PLANET.

Longer Review: A great milestone in the progression of First Person Shooters. Gameplay is intuitive in the controls, navigation through from start to finish, audio and visual hints. The dificulty, pace and scale progression are fantastic and make for great replayability. While all this may seem standard in any modern FPS, this is where it was originally mastered. Story is huge in this game. It follows on from the original, Half-Life, set in a future after the events of the original game advanced from the on-site effects to a global change. You are the central character in potentially fixing the situation. The techniques used to tell the story are all through observation. Your only input is with your weapon or to prompt the action of a device or NPC. Exploring or speed running through the game, it's an experience with a lot of depth. Graphically this game has aged, though it was ground breaking when it was released. The model rigging and animation was beyond anything else for real-time rendering. Now, it's less detailed but still better executed than most games on the market. The visuals in this may cause mild headaches at points, but that's probably because you're still playing after 10hrs without grabbing a drink.",

I wouldn't recommend downloading the demo, nor looking at longplays on youtube and the like, just make sure you got around 3 days to yourself, tell everyone you're busy in that time, switch off your mobile, lock yourself away from civilization, and get a good PC and the rest is history. Maybe buy Black Mesa Source before jumping into this, there's not much of a need but atleast your playing the first game at its highest spec prior to this one.",

            "review_text": "Half-Life 2 is a piece of gaming history, much like its predecessor. When it arrived on the scene in 2004, it pushed PC gaming--and first-person shooters, in general--forward by leaps and bounds. It told a story with characters that were endearing through moments of action, horror, poignant exploration, and clever puzzle-solving. The game never takes the player out of the world--cutscenes don't exist in this series. Everything is viewed through your eyes in real time. Gordon Freeman is not a character; Gordon Freeman is the player.  This feature, among others, keeps the player grounded in the world of Half-Life. This makes the battles more real, the exploration more intriguing and poetic as the human stories around you are told by the people and the environments you encounter. Visually, the game is stylistic yet grounded in reality. It is science-fiction, after all. The facial animations are one of the shining moments of the game, despite other technical aspects showing their age. The sounds make you feel like you're in this defeated but hopeful world. The controls are fluid and intuitive.  All in all, the game is still fun to play after ten years, still looks and sounds good, and still has a few features that pull ahead of some contemporary games. Old fans feel right at home with Half-Life 2, new fans will find something interesting to dive into. I recommend new fans try to play in the frame of mind of PC gaming circa 2004, but even without a bit of mental time-travel, the game holds up well enough. Love it or hate it, PC gamers owe it to themselves to experience this milestone in history.",

I've just completed Half-Life 2 and find there is so much to say about this, it would be impossible to do it within the amount of time I'm wanting to spend writing this review, and so I'll make a short..ish review - or I'll try to anyway.   This game is very interesting, for it was made years ago and contains so much... thought and creativity. I must admit, through the first half of the game, I was becoming bored. It just seemed as though I was doing the same thing all the time. However, one thing I did pick up was the puzzles. There were some puzzles that got me confused during the first half of the game, and I find that to be a very creative thing to add in to this kind of game. It has a sci-fi element, and when puzzles and sci-fi are put together, it really does create an amazing experience.   During the second half of the game, I found I was starting to enjoy the game more. I'd began to rush through the game due to it's massive story line. By rushing, I mean I sprinted and jumped and just full-out went in shooting enemies and picking up those health kits ASAP. It really was a big help and I died a lot less - believe it or not.   New enemies were introduced in the second half and I found it really cool about 3/4 into the game where something special about one of the enemies had came up. I won't say any more due to the fact that I don't want to give spoilers.   At the end of the game, I felt amazed. The last level really was something, and it was totally worth the wait, as I had been told by a couple of people that have played the game before me. Everything they said was true. The last level really is worth the countless hours of gameplay to get there, and the main enemy behind all of the... chaos... was amazing.  The ending made me a little bit confused - but I think that was supposed to happen. You can find out for yourself when you play the game. ;)  During the game, there are a lot of conversations that you have to stand and listen to (or ignore) before you can continue the level. This was very fraustrating for me, and you may fidn it fraustrating as well. A couple of friends have told me that it was also very fraustrating for them, too.  Overall, I'd say this game really was a big step towards the new games that are produced now. All of it's creativity seems to have been expanded into lots of AAA games out there right now and improved. I'd rate this game 7/10 due to it being a little bit long-winded - but trust me, it's totally worth it. Also I deducted another point due to the un-skippable conversations that you have to go through.  Also, there is a free update for the graphics. I have not used it for my gameplay experience, but you, personally, might like some better graphics. So go on the Steam Store and get 'Half-Life 2: Update' for free once you have bought the main game. :)",

            "review_text": "Half-Life, what is it, is it a video game, could it be a tale that no other game could do without getting it wrong, yes...  For me, Half-Life was the first ever game I bought an owned, I remember that day. August 2nd, 2007, my father got me my very own steam account, and this game, my first game, MY VERY OWN GAME! It was amazing to me, I remember fearing for my life, crying as the civil protection was 'clearing' the apartments, or when I first encounter Alyx Vance, Barney, Doctor Kliner, and his pet head crab, Lamar. Or when I first saw the Air Boat, and realizing that something epic will come, and it did, yah, an air boat is cool, BUT WHAT ABOUT A UPGRADE THAT WOULD MAKE ME AND THE HUNTER CHOPER EQUALS, AND ABLE TO FIGHT IT ON! Later after that, I fought with the metallic flying beast, and we both knew only one of us would survive to tell the tale. I remember when I first met D0G, a robotic canine, well, similar, but more then just a yaye-high pet. Then I grew of anger as the combine destroyed everything that was of Black Mesa East. I had to go to Ravenholm, a place that even my most cherished companion, Alyx, feared and avoided to look towards that direction, I wondered why this was the case. But I had to put my friends fears of that pace aside, and march in, and continue my journey towards the end goal. As I slowly put my foot on the old, and ruined grass, I see death, despair, and danger. I feared Ravenholm a lot, I guess you could say, it was too much for me. Ever since, I never escaped Ravenholm...  But then, in the summer of 2012, I returned to Half-Life 2, played through it again, and looked towards that dreaded place as Alyx was explaining about it, before the combine attack. I knew I had to finish Half-Life! And so, I got a ♥♥♥♥ing huge 2 L bottle of Coca Cola, and journeyed through that place, I remember my hart beating as those Fast Zombies were clawing at me, and waiting for that small platform to carry me away from danger. Then me, and a creepy religious man with a double barrel shotgun walked through the graveyard, and at that last moment, he sacrificed himself for ME! I remember my shocked mind as he ran through fire, laughing and killing the zombies. I turned towards the exit, and ran without looking back. I remember seeing the sun again, and never felt the same ever again. I remember seeing the Jeep and was shocked, first an Air boat, now a Jeep with, a, umm, laser gun, oohhh boy, the looks were deceiving, I then killed my first gunship, and crossed the large, shaking bridge, and avoiding the train as it did its routine...  Oh yah, then the sand traps, I ran right through that, then the prison, boy, I remember laughing as I saw the antlions take down combine and/or the turrets, and seeing how loyal they were to me, this was just the beginning, then me and Alyx teleport in the FUTURE, well more like a week, but then all of humanity decided to start an uprising due to the signal after teleporting from the citadel. Then I fought lots of striders, soldiers, CP's, gunships, till I got to the citadel. That first moment where intense music started right as I exit a sewage pipe, to see the citadel slowly mining into the planet, I had to stop them, and so I did, with the help of the combine and their ♥♥♥♥ed up anti-weapon device, they modified my anti-gravity gun, to grab soldiers, and also, have an higher carnage. And I fought with Breen, destroyed the citadel, and saw the Gman again, this all felt amazing ,the carnage, the intense finally, and the perfect cliff hanger for the next 2 episodes, that I got later...",

Those features may not sound like much, but after all these years, in-game facial animation and player tracking are two things that countless 'AAA' developers rarely hit or in many cases ignore completely and are substituted with cutscenes or scripted events and QTEs.  All those things that developers miss nowadays is what brings me back, not just to Half-Life 2, but to many of Valve's other amazing games. 2 out of 2 thumbs up, would synergize.",

The making of HL2; I love how you can change Gman to Gman 2.0 (GMan in HL2) with the Graphics, The weapons in HL2 are just like in HL1, and now, HL3.

Game is set in a distant future, somewhere in Eastern Europe, about twenty years after the Black Mesa Incident from the first game.  The main character is a scientist named Gordon Freeman, who's kicking some major *** with his partner Alyx Vance. Freeman, who hasn't aged a day since he disappeared after the Black Mesa Incident because he was in stasis, appears on a train heading to City 17. A couple of citizens talk about city life and the process of being transferred to City 17. Arriving there, Gordon meets armed police officers known as Civil Protection. Gordon is forced to escape City 17, with Civil Protection officers in hot pursuit.  +Game is aged well in the year 2004, it can also be placed near new titles with AAA graphics which we got now. +Controls feel great, movements are very solid, no mouse skip or autoaim. +Storywise this game is like a blockbuster filled with action. if we get to the last part of the game, you can really be excited using your super powered weapons. It's not an immersive storytelling like game wants you to believe but you feel like you're into this game yourself and play as you rather than Gordon Freeman. +Soundtrack is well made, give you that special mood for killing zombies abd combines, same goes for sfx +First Valve game on this engine, presentation and the beggining of source engine legacy began with this. This game is a father of Team Fortress 2 and Portal francise.  Final Verdict: 9.5 AWESOME (it's totally nine and a half, half of enjoyment counts twice as fun)",

So often the game makes you chuckle in disbelief, press the 'F9' (load last save) key because you feel you *must* see that breathtaking sequence again and in overall it makes you replay it time and time again. This game is, in simple words, an astounding accomplishment.   Exceptionally well thought-out storyline and immersive experience; we see everything from Gordon's eyes. Half-Life is unique in the sense that you are not the intended game's protagonist, the game's protagonist is YOU. Everything is left up to your own interpretation, understanding and words. There's so much to say about the saga of Half-Life (because yes, the Episodes as well as the first game and its two expansions, OF and BS, are just as fantastic), but words are weak to convey justice to such a magnificent game. In my opinion, it is simply the best first-person shooter of all time. The most well thought-out and influential, at least. Even though the typical 'dystopia-alien invasion' storyline is quite common these days, Valve found a way to make it unique. I believe what makes Half-Life stand out from everything else is that Valve grabbed a storyline which is now common and sometimes hackneyed and made it BELIEVABLE. They made it feel REALISTIC and BELIEVABLE to the player, and crafted a wonderful, unusual protagonist which was given somewhat of a story but the rest is filled by you; this protagonist makes this absurd world of aliens, torture, blood, fear and dystopia work, no matter how unrealistic it may seem.  Half-Life, the entire franchise, has haunted me for a long time. The story is as rich and big in complexity as it is in enigma, so many questions are conveyed and yet left unanswered. I love the game, I'm in complete love with Gordon Freeman and the other characters (specially Barney) and with how well all the chapters in this game were made. Ravenholm is capable to fetch a perception of sadness and fear, the rebellion and the uprising elude feelings of both hope and doom, questions of *what* is going to happen arise and more disappointment appears because there are *no* definite answers, at all. Valve keeps throwing stuff at you and you don't ever have enough time to process it. And when you sit down to think about it, too many answers are possible. Valve takes the whole 'open to interpretation' notion at a whole new level.  I'd recommend this game to everyone, and if you don't have this game in your Steam library, I'M JUDGING YOU REAL HARD HERE. No, but it's a must-play, even if it isn't your type of game. Even with how exceptional the game is, however, many people may not and do not enjoy it, not only because it might not be 'their cup of tea', but because Half-Life 2 is a game which requires patience (not as much as the first, though!), and it may not be a good game to someone who plays games to slouch or relax a bit, or to play for a short while. It's pretty intense and hectic. However, I'd still recommend it nonetheless.   Half-Life 2 gets a 10 out of 5 from me!",

I remember playing this on his old xp computer, throwing cans at the police. Such simple times. What todays games don't have is a linear story, a story that can truly hook the player,,, And from what games I'm basing from is battlefield, far cry, and even call of duty. Nowadays, people just depend on the graphics, which I think you can't get anymore realistic then the cry engine for that matter. So my question to the developers is, Why not? Why not make a game that actually depends on the story and the gameplay instead of just having 10 minutes of gameplay with Over saturated lens flare and grass moving a pixel faster,,,,, HL2 is perfection, graphics are still great, the story is hooking, and if you're reading this, you can see how many positive reviews. Cause it has made many people jobs, money, and most importantly,,, memories. Valve is brilliant with the gameplay as I've said it numerous times. Honestly, if there are rumors out there for hl3,,, I would leave it alone, Valve is getting pressured to literally change history again. To be practical, I think they should just maybe just make an episode on the exisisting engine or source 2, and make a plot that seems entising to the fans. Or they can just leave where they are standing. Which is also not a bad idea, cause I don't think Steam or Valve for that matter is gonna get bought out by sony, or any other company. Again, this is a great game. I will never forget it. Thanks for reading.",

Not in a long time has a game had me wanting to play it for hours the moment I woke up in the morning. And then have me wanting to play it again right after to get 100%! Now I can understand why everyone wants Half-Life 3 so badly and once I beat the game a second time to get all the achievements, I'm heading off to play episode 1 and 2.  This game has rightfully earned it's place as one of the best games of all time. 5/5",

Half-Life 2 does everything right that Half-Life does... and then goes even further, doing an even more fantastic job with its story. The graphics and level-design are both very aesthetically pleasing, and the actors all do their job very well (Though the best voice actor would definitely have to be Dr. Freeman's. Very excellent job). And the story, like it's predecessor, tells it completely through animations and no cutscenes to be found, giving the game a nice steady flow. The game also has a great atmosphere. It can feel hopeless, empowering, and frightening at appropriate times. And the world that is created outside of Black Mesa labs is well shown and characterized, to be a very believable place.   Honestly, I only have two very small qualms with this game and that would be the loading screens and occaisional glitches. I never found an actual in-game glitch in graphics or animation, but rarely the sound would cut out of a random NPC's dialogue. And for a game that flows so well, the loading screen for the next section of a level can bring all that build-up to a halt. But these are only minor problems, that didn't take away all that much from how great the game is. Half-Life 2 is definitely one of the best video games I've ever played, and I can guarantee it'll be one of the best games you'll ever play as well. I cannot recommend this game enough.",

I'd also suggest you pick up the original Half-Life to better understand the characters that are introduced to you in this game, as I originally started with HL-2 and had to piece things together as a wee lad.  There's also expansions for the original Half-Life, I haven't tried Blue Shift but I have played Opposing Force.

She has THREE houses on her block. I went up to the door, which had THREE chips on it, and knocked THREE times. After THREE seconds, she said: 'Be right there!'- it had THREE words in it. She came up to the door and took off THREE locks on her door. She invited me into the kitchen for cookies, while all of her THREE cats ran past me, one of which had THREE spots on him. She told me to sit down next to the table, which had THREE chairs. She handed me the platter with THREE cookies on it, and said that her THREE cats took THREE of the cookies THREE times. So we sat down for THREE minutes, and talked about THREE subjects: Major companies, Games, and Numbers. After that, we sat in my grandma's living room, and watched THREE different channels. After a while, she started to get thirsty, so I generously got up from one of the THREE sofas, went into the kitchen, and opened the fridge. I spilled THREE drinks, but I got more for my grandma. When I came back into the room, she was watching a commercial for a product that said: 'If you don't get it in THREE days, it's free! Only $33.33!' I sat down and started reading a magazine for children- the THIRD issue. It was on how to add. 1+1-1+1+1=3. That didn't seem appropriate for a children's book, so I went on the computer in my grandma's bedroom, and found out the company had been in buisiness for only THREE years. Now it made sense. It was time for me to leave because I was going to a party with THREE of my friends. My grandma gave me THREE seashells as a present, which I thanked her THREE times for. So then I left out the door, walked to my car, and drove away.   So, what I'm trying to say is that I had a great time at my grandma's house. ",

The concept is great, but there is no actual material in the story throughout the game. I never really though about the story, as I had with games such as BioShock, System Shock 2, and The Walking Dead. It could be improved greatly with the addition of more important characters and plot twists, which fortunately are more prominent in the episodes. -No connection to the first game, save for a few subtle references. If you were a complete outsider to the series, you would not know that HL2 was the sequel to Half-Life. I would have liked to have seen an immediate continuation of Half-Life's story rather than a completely new one set many years later.  Due to all this, HL2 does sadly feel like you just run-n-gun. There's very little thought involved, you don't care or know much about any of the characters, and story is almost nonexistent. Say every character (other than the enemies) was removed, you would not notice much of a difference.  However, it HL2 is GREAT run-n-gun. It's action packed the whole time, and most of all, it's fun to play.  Not as good as Half-Life, but the episodes are excellent and contribute to the plot much more. 7/10",

In terms of sound and graphics Half-Life 2 maintains the high standard we have come to expect from Valve, even the voice-acting is bearable.  Now, the biggest deal with Half-Life 2. And the reason most people will be interested in it in the first is of course, mods. And there is plenty of them. Unfortunately, not nearly as many or as much quality as in the original, and that really is what it comes down to. All the great games and mods that got their start in Half-Life 1 have become full fledged games already.

Especially after the numerous re-creations the original has seen. Half-Life 2's atmosphere is too chaotic and it's plot is too generic for it to be considered a masterpiece. But even beyond that, it's a well crafted shooter. It often forgets to be fun or itneresting, but it still holds itself tightly, so sci-fi and shooter enthusiasts should not skip this one (funny how I say this, like they have or might). Those expecting a good story or interesting, varied gameplay, can afford to skip. And those of us who wanted more of the horror aspect... well, there's always Half-Life 3. Right?",

The game is very famous, it has become a part of global mass culture, and it would be really hard to find someone who had never heard of it, at least. Still, I've got a habit to write a couple of words about games I've played, and there's no reason for this one to be an exclusion.  So, this is half a shooter, half a puzzle. You are supposed to use not only your guns, but also your brains, and that is most probably the reason why it's been a hit. I can also see how the game defined the shape of future shooters that appeared after it. I can now understand why it's always been considered as classic.  It's tough, and it demands concentration. It's not just having fun, it's surviving (by the way, I am totally sure that a normal living person could not have possibly survived all that story). No matter how often you save the game, it's always not often enough. In some of its episodes this game can be badly annoying and irritating, making you want to catch one of those metrocops or soldiers by his throat and punch, punch, punch his face until there's nothing to punch. (Well, maybe I'm exaggerating a bit.)  Solid product; challenging, involving, lengthy (it took me 20 hours to complete it). Nice companion girl included.",

Set in the dystopian 'City 17,' physicist gone action hero: Gordon Freeman is tasked with stopping human ambassador Dr. Wallace Breen from doing something evil probably. Who can honestly say in today's economy?  Half-Life 2 is a game that I would only really call good enough. It's clear that the form of story-telling and gameplay the game uses was pretty out of the norm at the time of it's release, but when it's played in retrospect it can feel a little cluttered and unproffesional at times.  I'll be fair to Half-Life, it's not IT'S fault that it was so influential. And it's probably worth at least a little bit of limelight considering that it managed to fit so much innovation in such a bizzare sequel, but if you ignore the enemy AI, real time facial animation, half decent physics system, and that plot twist that you defintely saw coming, than all you have is a broken shooter with the plot of a semi-decent teen dystopia novel.  The combat itself isn't terrible it's the scenarios the game bats you with that are the crux of the problem. It is objectivley unsatisfying to be slowly staggering your way to a gun turret/sniper by dodging between cover. It is objectively not fun to use the rocket launcher on a helicopter that shoots you the moment you try to properly aim. It is BAD game design to distract the player with enemies when they are supposed to be focusing on something tactical instead of action based.  The level design is bland and unfocused, without a lot of setpeices that stray from the very basic visual aspect of fun. And although the actual designs of enemies and structures are interesting and dynamic, they do a poor job at guiding the player through them towards the goal. There were too many times when I simply got lost in the same couple looping rooms, not realizing there was an entire other segment hidden behind a ledge somewhere. If I can't progress in a video game, want it to be because I was too inadequate to follow it's orders, not because the video game did a poor job at ordering me in the firt place.  There are too many gimmicks that stray on for far too long. Instances where I say to myself, 'Sure it would be cool to [Traverse the mechanisms under a bridge] [Fight a helicopter that spews bombs in a motorized boat] [Command a squad of allies through dangerous terrain]' but I ended up being sick of it by the time I met the halfway mark of that gimmick alone. And that's not including the gimmicks that DIDN'T seem like fun ideas. (I'm looking at you Ant Lions, Head-Crab Mine, and driving section!)  None of what I said is meant to imply that Half-Life 2 is a terrible game, heck it's not even a BAD game, it's a good game, maybe even a great game, but it definetly isn't a perfect game. It has it's fair share of entertaining fights, sure. And even some gripping bits of story near the end. (Heck the entirety of the climax is the most fun I've genuinely had in this game.) But that doesn't mean that praising the game with perfect scores is going to make Valve any better at video game design. And heck, it isn't going to make Half-Life 3 any better. And let's be honest, if THAT game doesn't end up being perfect...  ... ... ... ..Naw we'll probably still love Gaben",

            "review_text": "Half-Life 2 is a nice little FPS game that lets you think outside the box when it comes to gameplay. The game was a big deal when it was released, being the successor to the original Half-Life, which was just as critically acclaimed as the sequel.  GAMEPLAY (8/10) Half-Life 2, like I said earlier, really lets you think outside the box. It's one of the few games that integrates the physics engine into the gameplay. You can use your 'gravity gun' to hurl projectiles at the bad guys, or use physics objects to aid you in the gameplay, like quickly scrabbling together a makeshift barricade from barrels and wooden palletes. The gunplay has aged a bit - Half-Life 2 doesn't have a cover system, leaning system (really wish it had this), iron sights, steady aim feature, or many of the things that are common in modern titles. The game was fairly classic-styled even at the time in this way. Sometimes, the classic style serves the game well - other times, it just makes it not as up to par to games of today.  PRESENTATION (9/10) Half-Life 2 is great in this aspect, especially for its time. The game has really great music that gets you pumped up for action. The graphics looked pretty good for 2004. The characters look extremely realistic and have really great animations, too - something that was revolutionary when Half-Life 2 came out. The voice actors are pretty good and deliver lines believably and with emotion.  STORY (9/10) The game has a unique storytelling method. It rarely reveals detail directly. However, that does not make the story have any less depth. The developers left around many clues that leave you guessing and speculating about the backstory. Put all the clues together and you have a really well-crafted backstory. The game has an interesting cyberpunk, dystopian setting with believable characters. The main plotline is good and fairly realistic. Control is never taken from the player, except times where it makes sense - That's right, they don't interrupt the gameplay with cutscenes.  Good game. If you haven't played it already, it's considered a classic. If you have ever enjoyed a FPS, you'll like this one.",

            "review_text": "Half-Life 2... I wanted to get this review out of my system for a very long time. Back in 2004 when this game was released, I got hooked. It was another game changer, it paved the road for fps games to come, and it made history with it's many aspects that still hold up to this day... or do they? Looking at it now, Half-Life 2 is one of those games that has aged a lot since it's release 11 years ago. I think it's safe to say that in some aspects it's aged well, but in others... well we'll get onto that very soon.  Gameplay in Half-Life 2 is relatively slow, with your standard pace of walking. This sets the pace of the game itself, where you're mostly walking down your path fighting your enemies. I think this slower pacing helps the game, by letting the player appreciate it's atmosphere and visuals more. However I must admit that the visuals don't have the power they did back in 2004. They can't hold the player's attention as well as they did. The game could've made up for this by also focusing on it's ambient atmosphere. Most of the time it gets that right, but there's times where I felt that certain areas lacked atmosphere to them. Gameplay has a certain variety to it, that I think most games lack even today, and this is a plus. Valve is very well aware that a game needs to alternate between it's gameplay styles for it to remain fresh for the player. You have sections with platforming, exploration, high intensity combat, sneaking, physics puzzles, and driving. Most of the time, the game does a decent job in keeping this variety up well. However there's times where it fails to do so, and you get drawn out sections like the coastal levels. It is here that Valve's focus on the physics sensation of the 2004's really drags the game down. Had this chapter had more variety, and less focus on 'look, we have driveable vehicles', it wouldn't have dragged the game down so much. The same could be said about the boat riding segment, but the problem there was less prominent. Back in the day, these problems were less prominent, because the sights, the expanses and the physics really tied your attention down, but today, that part of the magic is gone.  Story-wise, this game improves upon it's pedecessor's storytelling by bringing in unique characters, who are all interesting for the most part, and the developers obviously focused a lot on the depth of the story. I must admit, my favorite part of the game were the Breencasts, which showed an obvious devotion to a certain philosophy behind the propaganda spread around by Breen and his overlords. It had spirit to it. I just wish such a focus was given to other aspects of the story. This is where I'm gonna go onto the negatives. The problem with the characters, is that their introduction comes out of nowhere. We're to assume we knew a lot of our characters before, like Eli, Kleiner, Barney, who were all just stock models back in the original. I think if the game actually built new characters from the ground up, it would have benefited the game more. In this game, Alyx was a more interesting and well made character than in the subsequent games. She wasn't as clingy, she knew her way around and could operate alone. Her time with Gordon was minimal, and there wasn't the uncanny romantic tension between her and the player as there was in the episodes. She was bearable.  Still, I think one of the things that hurt the story the most were it's shortcomings from the original game. Gordon Freeman was originally a silent protagonist in Half-Life 1, because the role didn't need him to talk. Character interaction was limited to unnamed characters who all sounded the same, and looked alike. There was little to no character development in the original. This however, is no longer the case in Half-Life 2, here characters directly interact with the player on a personal level, and it's so obvious that Valve tried their best to form the dialouge around the silent protagonist concept, and it falls short. Without Gordon deciding for us what to do, the player really gets to feel the confines of the linear progression of the game, as he is practically forced to go through everything in the game, to the last detail. Would we at least hear him acknowledge, approve, or decide to do what is ahead of him, it would at least dull the feeling of linearity.  I think this is perfectly apparent when Alyx thanks Gordon at the end for coming after her father and her in the citadel. Gordon, even from the player's perspective, really had no choice in his actions. It feels like he's completely forced to do everything by the rock-solid linearity of the game, without any choice. This really detracts from the immersion of the game.  Valve obviously wanted the player to feel like he's in Gordon's shoes. The game's ego-pleasuring way of revering Gordon Freeman, who is really the player in this case adds to this aspect. I found that this also detracted from my suspension of disbelief, because in the original game Gordon Freeman was just an everyman facing hostile aliens and military with no training behind him. He was just another survivor trying to get out alive. Half-Life 2 abandons this, and turns the player into an object of worship. Gordon is no longer an everyman, he's no longer the average joe who's just trying to stay alive. He's a legend, he's a savior, a messiah. I find that this distanced me from Gordon, because I can't immerse myself into that role. At the same time Valve wants me to feel like I am a hero, since Gordon is supposed to be me. There's a major conflict here arising from the silent protagonist concept, and it's datedness shows in this game a lot.  The ending in this game has been criticized a lot by many, but I think it's the least of the game's problems. The game cuts out after we've defeated our true enemy, Dr. Breen. We've disabled the citadel's portal, we've defeated Breen, and the Combine are falling around us. We're saved from an explosion at the last momment by the G-Man. I think that the ending, in a way, was very well done. It marked the end of the human effort by Gordon Freeman, the momment where the great savior, the hero meets his end against something he triggered unwantingly. His journey would've been over, had it not been for the G-Man. It was a kind of poetic seal, because had he not been saved, he would've died instantly. His life in that line of events was over, and I think that at this point, a sequel might not have been necessary at all. The series could've ended here. The G-Man's words also provided an epilouge to the game that I felt closed it in a way that fit with Half-Life.  Overall, I think Half-Life 2 hasn't aged as well as other games have. Time has withered it's edges, when it comes to the original awe and freshness of it's engine that amazed us all back in 2004. Still, does that mean it's a bad game? Not at all, it still holds up in many aspects. I recommend it, because it's a piece of gaming history, and overall it still has the spirit that made it really good.",

It featured a form of storytelling that was far more in your face than the original but not too in your face to drive away any fanbase. The music is centered onto events which i though were appropriate for an audial playback however I did have one point in which I felt the music wasn't right, it was close to the start when you re-acquire your suit I had the same problem with Half-Life 1 though, but 1 meh didn't deter me from the game. Half-Life 2's gameplay is quite like the original in a way that includes the same puzzle-inspirations and various other things including a more intense combat experience with a few more guns. The thing that made HL2 stand out at the time was the physics engine which for its time was revolutionary but the physics engine included in this installment is (in my opinion) better than any other physics engine to date (Portal and Garry's Mod include the same physics engine). For example if i take a look at Fallout 4, a game released this year its got nothing on HL2's physics (Gordon Freeman is a theoretical physicist so that is why they added a physics engine (totally not to make money)). All around it was revolutionary in its day and nothing less than enjoyable today.",
