            "review_text": "TL;DR: Its not quite as good as LoG 1/2, but its still good. Graphics and ambient sounds are nice. One thing, the female voice's 'oof' when you get hit bugs me, especially when you get hit with a DoT and it 'oof's every second. MAJOR flaw is theres no alternate weapon sets, making ranged weaps useless - you actually have to go into inven and re-equip everything to switch ranged/melee, suicide since the game doesnt pause in-menu. Combat &amp; magic is simple, the magic system is just a click to cast, instead of runes or whatnot. Still, in a genre that hasnt seen many decent games recently, Ruzar is a breath of fresh air and worth picking up. Longtime fans of the genre will enjoy it, but its also accessible to new players of the genre.  ______________________________________  Long review in which I compare Ruzar mostly to LoG and DM- the two major standouts in the genre  I was born in 1981. I grew up playing turn based and realtime grid dungeon crawlers like Eye of the Beholder, Dungeon Master, the Wizardry series, Might and Magic, and so on. Unfortunately, with the exception of Legend of Grimrock 1/2 (which I had minor issues with, see below) the genre of realtime grid crawlers has been pretty much neglected. Not much of note coming out.  Ruzar, fortunately is good. Not *quite* as good as LoG, but a good game nontheless. The graphics and ambient sound are awesome. For instance, in the mountain level, you really feel like you're wandering around in a windswept lonely maze on a wintery mountain. Combat sounds are exactly what you'd expect, sword swings, spells wooshing, and a 'ugh' or 'oof' type sound when youve bumped into walls or get hit. Enemy sounds are cool, spiders chitter and spit, armored skeletons groan and clank about. Every enemy so far has noises that you'd expect that type of enemy to make.  The gameplay is familiar to anyone who plays RT grids, and one thing I like personally: (deserves a little bit of explanation so here goes)...You can get away with not constantly &amp; precisely step-dancing.   See heres the issue. My left hand is partially paralyzed. My *one* MAJOR problem with LoG 1/2 was the fact that the enemies were so tough &amp; fast you had no choice but to stepdance constantly, accurately, and quickly. Going toe to toe with most of the enemies from the midgame on was sheer suicide, even on the easier difficulties. You couldnt even take a few hits. Not so good if you are only using your index finger on a paralyzed hand without much spatial relation.   Ruzar doesnt have that problem. The monsters seem a bit faster tham the oldchool ones like DM but not as relentless as LoG although the AI is decent enough to do things like try and come at you from the side, and dodge out of the way when youre step-dancing. I saw people mention they didnt like the slower pace, but for me its awesome. People who really really enjoy the greuling tactical stepdance might find it not as fun, though. It does have a difficulty level, but I have yet to see if that improves the AI or just makes each monster tougher.  The story's pretty simple so far (as most grid realtime crawlers are), but not bad. There is an NPC that you can talk to with a shop (also some interesting backstory, you know who she is if you read the intro story), with a storage box nearby for all your extra gear - pay to unlock slots. First is 10 for 1 silver. Thats cool. Theres also a teleport mechanism so you dont have to backtrack all over hell and high water to get to the shop &amp; storage. I'm looking forward to seeing more NPCs to add to the story. There appears to be quests as well.  Now about the levels. They are your typical grid-dungeon puzzles such as riddles where you have to drop an item, 'run through here quick to avoid traps', walk in the correct pattern to open the door, find the secret button, put a rock on the pressure plate and so on. They are beautiful, and very large, but it seems like theres not much going on so far. Enemies here and there, and a few items. I'm expecting it to get crazier as I progress. Theres a good automap with a nice note feature, as well as the ability to move while looking at the map. Note that in Ruzar going into the char sheet or map does not pause the game, like DM.  I like how the audio works, similar to LoG diferent enemies make different idling sounds. You can hear them off in the distance and know when youre approaching.   Since you only have 1 PC, combat is a simple matter of clicking your weapon/cast icon to attack or your quickbar to use an item (or hotkey - thats a nice feature, theres a hotkey for everything!), and I do miss LoG and DMs 4 party/2 hands each system. Ruzar is much simpler in this regard.   The magic system is simpler than either DM (still the all around best skill/magic system IMHO), or LoG. It runs very similar to the combat, click the cast button to cast. You can switch spells on the fly by clicking the spell's icon as well. Theres a magic/melee toggle you can hit to switch back and forth (and a hotkey), they arent on the same UI. To learn new spells find magic scrolls, and you must memorize them at a 'binding stone'. Then you have them in your magic list. You can also unmemorize them at the stone as well if youre full up.  The menu UI could be better. My absolute biggest complaint is that you cant have an alternate weapon loadout (at least AFAIK, correct me if I'm wrong), say a) a crossbow and b) a dagger and shield that you can switch with a keypress. You actually have to go to inventory and double click the thing you want to equip. Thats fun when you've got a sword AND shield to equip and theres a skeleton 5 feet away trying to tear your face off.   When coupled with the no-pause-in-menu, its just annoying and makes it so ranged weapons are pretty much useless, unless you want to go running ridiculously far back when youre out of ammo and then run all the way back to the fight with your melee loadout equipped. its much easier to step-dance in melee than ever used a ranged weapon.  One of the things I didn't like about LoG was the 'static class' system. Unlike DM, fighter types couldnt use magic. No having your fighters gain mage levels by casting light over and over, or your back row chucking swords to gain ninja levels. Ruzar is more like DM, you can specialize, or be a jack of all trades. However, runs off an XP-from-kill system like LoG so just throwing stuff and casting fireballs at walls does nothing (ahh, the memories of flinging cheese all over). It does have a lightweight skill tree starting at level 5 to specialize your char more. I like that.  Overall, Ruzar is worth playing. Its not quite as epic as LoG or DM, but its good and if you consider yourself a fan of the genre, pick it up!",

I did not see a texture that was messed up. Or a model that was poorly made.  The person who coded this game did a ♥♥♥♥ poor job. Why do I move so slow that each action feels forced. There are not enough monsters to fight. So I spent most of the time filling out the map. The things that are interactable need a key or lever to use. There are things in this game that I think could have been smashed by my weapon. Also the models of the skeleton warroirs that are on the ground. I wish I was able to pick up the weapons and armor they had. Why am I not able to destory boxes? The traps where just annoying.  I did not enjoy playing this game. It is nice to look at but not fun.
