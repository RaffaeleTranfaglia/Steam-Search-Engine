But all in all, a pretty standard Lego game. You collect studa, characters etc. Once you've got the studs multiplyer though, the game becomes far less challenging.",

            "review_text": "If you are a fan of Lego games this one is pretty much similar to the others. It looks nice, has that classic Lego humour and play feel, however the game is short and you can expect lag every so often and a number of crashes.  I'd suggest buying it on sale because the crashes and lag can be annoying but don't ruin the game completly.",

            "review_text": "Like all LEGO titles this is a great game, esopecially for playing with someone using controllers like I did. Great graphics and it runs on 60 fps.  However, the story is very short and the fact that there are no achievements makes me not want to finish it 100%.",

            "review_text": "I probably would have given this game a 9/10 back when it originally came out. Now? Well, the graphics are poor (even maxed out) and the storyline is confusing, especially without voices from the actual game. The gameplay itself is fine but doesn't really doing anything special to separate it from the large collection of lego titles. There's nothing special, it's just another lego game, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. I recommend you should buy it if you like the series and you think the price is cheap enough. It's playable, but there are definitely better lego games out there. 7.7/10",
