Dude constantly moans - about his love life, his career, his friends (I can't believe he has friends), the soup getting cold, that hydrogen atoms only contain one electron, everything - and it gets incredibly monotonous just listening to the guy gripe his ♥♥♥♥ off, while not being able to do anything but glance at the wall clock, eat bread, get progressively more drunk (the guy is staggering after just three glasses of wine - lightweight), light up some smokes by the window (he's not even allowed to smoke in his own home. WHAT.), crick his neck, and other minor actions , all through pressing keys on the keyboard (though, if you leave the keyboard alone, he'll do his own thing anyway, so why even bother). And through all this, this pretentious cunny-dribble assaults the player with his odious opinions on friendship, love, his own feckless introversion, and how the japanese girl he wanted to 'shag', as he so charmingly puts it, is a ♥♥♥♥♥ for not turning up at his pokey little flat for nasty-looking bread, cold oxtail soup and, probably, a less significant dicking than even a Japanese flea is used to.  Well, I say good for Meiko. I wish I'd stood him up, too. As it is, I'll just have to remember this game as a boring night in.",

It was funny to me but I knew that wasn't right so I guess I should feel sad because Julian can't 'Shag' his new girlfriend but that sounds stupid to even think that.  3/10 Its novelty prize worthy but I can see the potential for future games like it. Maybe some better dialougue, better setting, better interactivity and it will spawn a new idea of storytelling in video games. Until then have a drink and enjoy Julian's crappy mopping of being alone.",

Aside from that however, I take issue with what is stated in the About section of this game. It claims that controlling the subtle subconscious actions of the protagonist will resonate 'with Julian’s thoughts to form an absolutely singular form of intimacy.' Resonation is a reflexive action, which does not translate to this game. This game is idle animations and camera controls set to a monologue. If these animations and controls did in fact affect anything, this 'game' might have done something to that effect, but no, in reality, there is nothing to relate to in the pretentious character of 'Julian,' not his affinity for east asians, not his affinity for dinosaur comics or poetry, nothing.",

One must ask thesmelves.  Second of all is the appealing visual effects. I was absoloutly blown away by the look of the food and cigarettes. I could feel my stomach filling as I dined alone, on my bread and wine. What a beautiful nod towards Jesus. I was blown away.  Lastly, I want to mention the dialogue. While not 100% clean, it really struck me in a deep way. Showed how much of a hard time the character is having. My daughters hamster died recently so she can relate.

So, first things first: I actually enjoyed Dinner Date. Finally I can be lonesome, even in the virtual world! :)  The game, obviously doesn't come with its shortcomings-'short' being the keyword here. Like the description says, it is basically a 25 minute-very well recorded-narration on the life of Julian Luxemburg, who is, sort of, your avatar in this game, except he isn't but his subconsciousness is. This game is an experiment, how much elements of interactive story telling you can take away from it to still be interactive. And it actually left an impression on me. Not the interactive part, but the story, I could relate with the poor guy in a way too good way. The music is produced well and fits the mood perfectly.  On the graphical side, however, a lot more could have been possible. I am actually not sure, whether the author wanted it to be sort of realistic or more in a comic look. If the game shone on this side, I would not hesitate to recommend it for full price, however, you will probably want to look when it is available for a reduced price. I believe, experiments, such as this, should be supported and as such it is okay for this game to be free. And the author probably still needs to fully pay the voice actor and musician, so...  In the end, I imagine, this is one of the first games, where Steam refunds will be exploited, as there is practically no replay value. (I did replay it and enjoyed it a second time, but there was a long time in between.) So please, don't be a jerk and keep the game, if you appreciated it in any way-even if it just got you the realization, that you don't like this sort of games. :)",

If i had to give this game a rating, i would have to say infinity out of 10. 5 stars, and a round of applause, for the most innovative and brilliant game ever!",

I went into this game knowing absolutely nothing about it. I received it as a gift, and had not heard of it prior. I expected it to be a lame dating simulator, and it's probably the best praise I can give to say that it is not that. Instead, you play as the inner subconscious mind of young-ish man who's set up his small kitchen for a date. As he sits at the table and waits for his date arrive, you can influence his actions by focusing on different parts of the scene, all while listening to the man's thoughts as the night grows later and later.  Unfortunately, this gets monotonous very quickly, and you're stuck following a very linear path as you pick your way through all the interactive parts of the scene. It also becomes very obvious early into the experience what will happen, which doesn't help the game feel more like work than play.  It's too bad, because the premise is interesting, and it could have been enjoyable, even if only as an art piece. As it stands however, Dinner Date is too slow and predictable to be any fun, in my opinion.",

Although it gives you the illusion (at first) that your input advances the story that same illusion is shattered when you realize that you have to select preset choices to get new ones...   In the end I still liked the experience as it was odd &amp; refreshing but felt more like a psychological tool than a game...   Buy it for 2 reasons : when it's dirt cheap and/or to show to skeptical people that games can be more than just run &amp; gun like those blasted Call of Duty kiddie thingies... ",

Was I supposed to be able to connect to the protagonist on some deep level?  ... Because I sure as hell didn't make any connections here. This lacks the production quality of a proper game and feels more like it ought to be just a 10 minute 3D short, you add absolutely nothing to a short video by letting the person look around. The entire production just wreaks of mediocrity, and the most interesting thing about this game is that they are attempting to market their game in such a way that they can make money from this.  This is just laughable and gives me diarrhea at the same time.",

When she arrived at the crime scene she found multiple bodies all requiring immediate autopsy, those added to the backlog she already had meant she was certain that she was going to miss her and Donny's dinner date that coming evening.  Donny was understanding and forgiving when she cancelled. Being in the same field than her, he more than understood, though Ducky was working at the federal level so he got the benefit of an assistant whereas Jordan did not.  Jordan tried not to get upset about the rain check, but it was the second date they had cancelled in as many weeks. The other cancelation had been due to NCIS getting a case. Jordan was beginning to wonder if it was all a sign that despite her and Donny's affection for one another their jobs meant they were incompatible.

It is about 15 minutes long and there's basically nothing to do or affect. The subject matter was so banal that I spent the whole time waiting for a breaththrough that just doesn't happen.  I think it is also misleading by saying you 'become the subconscious' of the main character. Because you don't, you just hear it, and the only think you control is some conscious decision making (like pouring wine) and order of operations. In that way, it's a kind of interesting slightly experimental movie, but it's far from any roleplay possibilities offered by using a videogame over a short film.  I did like a lot of the visual design. The objects were well designed and the icons conveyed their points well while working with the theme. The acting was good.  I really wanted to like it. I think it's an interesting portfolio piece for all involved. But it's not worth paying for.",

It's a nothing simulator. For me, it wasn't thought-provoking or moving or even interesting, like most of these types of games aim to be in place of traditional gameplay. If you're going to remove gameplay elements like combat, leveling, etc you need to replace with them *something*. A story is usually what developers go with. Here they decided to go in a much more experimental direction and just replace all gameplay elements - including story - with nothing. Also, the game is incredibly short (this might be good, though). The time that I have on record is exactly how long it took me to complete the 'story' without rushing. This should have been a free game and even then it would have been hard to recommend.",
