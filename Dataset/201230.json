            "review_text": "I'll be honest, to me, EverQuest II really enhances the feel that rather than a game it's a world. While you can follow the quest line and get pretty high soloing, the game in my own opinion is more fun just running around with a group killing camps and dungeons.  I've gotta say, right now, in comparison to other MMORPGs, this game's graphics are very nice. I've always loved that feeling of such darkness in some places in Norrath, and such light in others. Personally, it's worked charms on me. I love the style.  You may be thinking 'this guy has spent tons of money on this game', but really, I haven't spent a dime on EverQuest II, though it definitely deserves it. With tons of races and classes, this game reaches maximum variety of choices. It has many little features that are cool like SOEmote with face tracking, now it has voice chat for groups/guilds, and it's graphics are stunning for a modern MMORPG.  Also, I thought I should mention... There. Is. A. Ton. Of. Content.  I play this with a few friends, so I suggest doing the same if you can!",

The good  Bright, vibrant world NPC animations are awesome - they turn to look at you, they emote and occasionally make snide and amusing comments Animations in general are good Good and varied classes Runs well on fairly old hardware Addictive (this is arguably a bad thing too) Great music Has a tremendous amount of depth to it Free to play model is decent, though you do get nag screens and prompts as to what you're missing out on Complex and involving crafting Shinies! Lots of titles and achievements Lots of cosmetic stuff Best housing system in an MMO by a light year. Nothing else comes close. Extremely solo friendly But it also has extremely challenging group and raid content Excellent sense of progression   The bad  Game is in a long, slow decline - fewer and fewer people are playing it Very pay to win - it's not forced on you in a major way, but spend a little cash and the game becomes a 99% faceroll Many zones are deserted, game feels empty at times Still has issues alt-tabbing out of it in fullscreen Graphics are showing their age Can be a serious timesink for those so inclined. May not be a bad thing necessarily.",

The audio is best turned off and listen to music because it can be boring.   There is one major problem with the game is that there are many many missions you complete and then to choose your reward you NEED a paid account.   In some ways you need very specific items which force you to go and pay to play this game, but you can get kinda far without paying but you are restricted and I mean restricted in massive writing.   It is a fun game to play with your friends or family together with a better alternative to WoW. If you can afford Guild Wars then get that. If not then this game will suit you perfectly fine.",

They are both extremely similar, with their own pros and cons evening out to make them both equal. At this point in time, though: WoW has a subcription fee, but also has more players, better support, better graphics, and Blizzard behind it. EQ2 has more classes, more races, is more complex, and is free with an optional paid service and a premium shop, but doesn't appear to be pay to win. Pay to have convenience perhaps, but not pay to win. For that reason alone, I'd highly suggest trying it out if you're a WoW fan, or if you're new to the MMO genre.

            "review_text": "I purchased this game back and 2008 and only played the 30 day free trial but didnt feel like it was worth the subscription fee at the time as I probably didnt put enough time into. When everquest 2 extended came out I downloaded it too but never ended up really playing it as I just couldnt get into it. Finally I decided to play it again now that it was Free to Play. Fist I downloaded the standalone client and played for quite sometime and began enjoying the what I was able to do in this game and what the future had in store for this game. When I noticed it was on steam I reinstalled it on here and Iv been playing non stop eversince.  One of the huge perks I found as I was playing was I had recieved tons of free ingame goods such as housing items, 500 Station Cash I didnt know I had and tons and tons of other bonuses I had recieved from purchasing and registering the game back on 08. This really had me sucked in now as even though most of the goods were not entirly powerful or usful for adventuring it really gave me a glimps of what I could do in the game. Especially with housing.  Graphics: This is obviously a game that is getting up in age and the graphics do show in this way, however it seems like this was the perfect time for graphics engines because a lot of these games still look really good. Its not all blocky and cluncky like a ps1 game or everquest one but its smooth and has really nice looking landscapes, armor sets ect. It all just rolls out to look so good for its age. There are tons of settings that you can dink with to make it look as good good as you need it and its garenteed youll probably be able to find what looks best for you depending on your pc spec.   In some of the main hub towns, especially freeport, the frames dropped crazy low. Im not sure if its a server issue or my internet. Its not so laggy that its unplayable by any means especially due to the fact that main cities are more or less used for grabbing quest, crafting, trading which means you wont need as many frames anyways to do these smaller faster taskes.  Gameplay: Iv sunk so much time into this game so fast too. I dont think iv been able to dedicate myself to an mmo from the start as quick as I did with this game; despite me not giving it the chance in the first place. Im still not even at the level cap of 95... Wait I read they raised it to 100 hahaha. Thats pretty awesome in itself to me because it means i still have a ton of content to buzz through plus the latest expansion pack. So far as of this review Im level 54 and I dont even really feel the game is a grind. It just leaves me wanting to play more. The questing type for the most part is standard kill so and so or get me this many of this thing but it does thow in some quests where unique items are given to you and that item is used to summon a boss for instance or special goggles to help you find clues. Even though it has so many of the standard quests I actually prefer them over the other quests wheree the special items are required. There usually less tetius and go quicker and this results in faster xp and gold and sick ♥♥♥ quest item rewards. This being said I still love the bit of variety it does have and it keeps me wanting more.  This game has made me fall in love with running dungeons. In the Guildwars games dungeons were always pretty fun with friends or a good group but they generally require you to wait around for a group or use there sick ♥♥♥ dungeon finder to get a group together. This is all well and sweet and pretty flawless for guildwars 2 but I like how I can freely run a dungeon alone or with a group here in everquest 2. It just depends on your level and ability. Theres the flipside to that. You can also run the dungeons with people when your at a lower level or whatever so that option is obviously still there I guess the problem with it is though, is finding a group of people around who want to help you and not just clear the whole place out a few seconds before you. I tuely feel that there dungeon matchmaking needs to be improved because I find it confusing as ♥♥♥♥ or not very functional at the time. It would be amazing if they incorperated a mega server type idea like Guildwars 2 as that solution in my opinion is ♥♥♥♥ing brilliant. I swear if Everquest 2 and Guildwars 2 had some awesome ♥♥♥ sex, that would be my dream game born. The game is free to play and is probably one of the most honest free to play games I looked into for the most part. Although most f2p models are coming around. It never forces you to purchase anything and you honestly have little of a need to spend a dime. I however got sucked in a bit but paying to research some skills faster or upgrade them to the Master Tier. I also bought some cool white armor skins which you obvously dont need. Iv also spent some station cash for instant repairs of my armor because I didnt feel like traveling back to town but repair men are all over and not to hard to find for the most part. I also sub'd last month and this month so I could adjust my alternate experience slider to give me more adventure xp for a few months but this was just something I wanted to test and it is a nice added feature but the free 50 percent option is still more the viable and works behind the scenes so you dont even need to think about it. Being at 50 percent Adventure experince also didnt feel like a grind when I was playing free, it just felt standard and A nice shinny option that was there if I ever chose to pay to use it.  My best purchase so far though that most people may want to concider adding is the Mercinaries pack which allows you to hire an AI companion that helps you in battle. Not only does it make leveling a little faster before level 50 it also makes it alot faster and combat will be alot easier with a merc, escpecally when when fighting mobs of heroic characters. I chose to purchase this extra fairly early on in the game with my real world cash as the higher the level you are in the game the more ingame gold he will cost to hire. Buying this pack also allows you to summon tour merc no matter where you are. I dont use him a ton unless im running a dungeon alone so he is not to pricey for my in game budget but it is something that I sort of felt like I was missing before I purchased the addon. This just might be me though. Playing the game without a merc is entirely doable you just might need to find a buddy instead and be a little social or if you have the addon find some buddies and bring mercs too. ♥♥♥♥ will hit the roof im assuming. I guess I was a little slow in the head because I didnt find the storyline quests in my log until my early 20s I think. Man I was jacked when I found these though. They gave me more to shoot for. A reason to play and read these quests. I was having a ton of fun just running sidequests and getting the rewards and when I found the storyline quests and they even better loot they offered I got pulled in more and it gave me all new reason to keep playing. One of the story missions game me a Raptor like mount for a reward. I was pretty pumped about that even though I already bought a horse. The raptor was slow though and had the ability to almost jump and glide. The gliding was cool but I was like ♥♥♥♥ this things way to slow so i never used it. Now however im in higher level areas which require more climbing or going around mountains. While I swapped to my raptor and there was no more going around big long hills I could now set my tracker to where the mobs were and jump right over the big cliffs until I got there. Its been saving me a ton of time. Now im just in the middle of the content and im still having a ton of fun. Daily achievments are also pretty fun and quite easy to get. Completing 2 will give you loyalty tokens that you actually want to spend. Now I have 33 token and im saving up for a wild ♥♥♥♥ing mansion for 65 or something. Its worth it and easy to collect. Cant type anymore :( STEAM! LOL",

If you're looking at this game thinking 'Oh, it's like WoW, but free!' You are wrong. If anything, it's more expensive in the long run. The 'dlc' that you NEED for anything decent costs an arm and a leg.   Long story short, do not play this game, it would be a waste of your time. However you'll most likely think that the positive comments are the gospel truth, however they have played the game far too much to turn on it now.    Now, down to why I don't like it.  The gameplay is very boring and the starting areas are desolate.  The combat system is terrible, who knows how they managed to go wrong with a template MMO combat system.  The game is ugly.  The characters look terrible and you're often left feeling the 'I'll just randomise my character and see what i get.'  Within the first 10 seconds being in game, i was bored.
