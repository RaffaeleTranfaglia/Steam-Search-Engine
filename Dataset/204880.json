            "review_text": "So what's good about this game? Well let Swerve tell you! This is going to be long as hell since I used to play the orginal a crap ton 3 years ago! So gather round children! Grab a seat and listen to the great story I am about to tell!  Diplomacy:  The game provides a pretty solid diplomacy system that fits in very well with the backstory of the game. This means that it's harder to ally with Vasari rebels when you're a Vasari loyalist, unless you already premade the teams ofc. The computer or player can give you missions, if you choose to do them will improve your relations with them. Eventually if they like you enough they ask for peace treaties, powerful pacts (These buff both of your factions), trade agreements, ect. Even though diplomacy is useful in a game, it's not the core aspect of this game, you shouldn't buy it expecting it to be a game like Anno 1404 where war is only an option. Your goal is to kill everyone, not to make peace with them.  TL;DR Overall it's a nice mechanic, it fits with the story, highly dynamic, and very diverse, but not the main focus of the game.  Combat:  Personally, I think the combat is very simple. You have your ship types:   -The Frigate : Light, fast ships. Most are used for offensive means such as taking out strikecraft or bombing planets. Some are better at taking out other ships than others. I wouldn't call it rock paper siscors but it's kinda close to it.  -The Cruiser : More expensive, but provide much more firepower and/or support than frigates. Enforcers/Crusaders/Kodiacs are probably going to be the front line of your fleet.  -Srikecraft : I feel I had to put this in somewhere. Strikecraft can only be created by Carrier Cruisers or Capitalships/Titians. They cannot be targeted by normal ships so you either need to counter them by using more strikecraft or use specialized frigates to take them out. They do a crap ton of damage if you leave them unchecked.  Strikecraft have 2 types: -Bomber (Good at taking out bigger ships) -Fighters (Good at killing bombers) -*Advent only* homing mines (They're mines)  -Capital ships: These are essential for any fleet. They are very expensive *You get your first one free, so pick wisely' and very powerful ships that provide ALOT of utility and/or damage to the fleet. They are tanky, and usually the first, or last to go down. They act like Warcraft 3 heroes where they level up if you gain enough experience from killing things. These levels unlock abilites for your capital ships that do various things. (Ex. Kol Battleship, The ability 'Finest Hour' gives him massive Health Regen and lowers cooldowns on his other ablities)  -Titians : These things a freaking scary. Huge warships each faction/subfaction gets a specific one. They do alot of damage, they provide HUGE utility (Ex. The TEC Loyalist Titian buffs his allys with reduced weapon cooldown and gives them all more shields). It takes 5 points of research to fully build one, and even then It costs alot of money. It's best used in late game.  -Starbases : These things are broken. I've turned around entire games using these things. They do LOADS of damage. You can counter them with a ship specialized in destroying buildings, because they out range them, unless you put them in the middle of the damn phase lane! Thats right, you can place them right where you enemy will enter and they wont even get a chance to say their prayers. And if you're TEC Loyaist, you can have 2. gg  -Pirates! If you ever play TEC Rebels you need buy a pirate fleet. Seriously. They have the best voice acting N/A. It's hilarious. There will be a pirate base on almost every map, you can place bounty on annother faction and they will attack the person with the most bounty. They don't have shields, they're kinda easy. Cool feature tho.  Diversification:  I think the ships are very well-designed. Each have their own jobs and none do the exact same job. They all look very different from one annother and are very detailed. They're voice acting is very professional. Overall they did a good job in diversification the different ships.   Mechanics:   The victor of a battle is mainly determined by whoever has the best ship composition and the most research. It's very rock paper siscors-esk. It's simple, you have shields, that protect the ship for so long and then breaks and then it does health damage, if it reaches zero the ship splodes. There's no complex locational damage, They all just kinda stand still and hit eachother until they die. Realistically, no captian in his right mind would just stand there and let his ship get rekt. But it's based off an old engine so I'll let it go.  However! The battles are epic as hell! Pretty lasers, Strikecraft flying all over the place, Capital Ships using they're cool  guns. They look very pretty, but nothing else.   Economy:  Economy is simple as well. The 3 resources you have is Credits, Metal, And Crystals. You can get credits from planets, which you can upgrade to house more people to tax. You can get metal/crystal from extractors that can be built on asteriods orbiting the planets. You can also research and build trade ports and oribal refineries/Matter Processers. TEC are very good at amassing credits. The Vasari are very good at getting minerals. The Advent are mixed.  You also have a thing called 'The Black Market' where you can buy and sell metal and crystals. It acts like a regular economy and if you sell too much the market crashes and it sells for literally nothing. If you buy too much the market booms and I think the price goes up by alot. Doesn't stop me from buying crystal tho, because lord knows I always need crystal. &gt;.&gt;  Every resource is renewable. It will never run out. However the more fleet upgrades you invest in, the more it will effect your economy (7 to 80% deduction without pacts/supply reductions). It actually makes turtling viable, and I KNOW EVERYONE ABSOLUTELY LOVES PEOPLE WHO USE THE GOOD OL' TURTLE STRATEGY.  Overall the economy is like every other RTS. Just without gatherers or giving a damn about exhausting resources.  The Art:  This game is beautiful. I love it. Every planet, ship, and building is 1080p and professionally crafted. The battles are awesome because of all the colorful lasers. Every race has different ships which look just as professional as all the others.   Voice Acting:  Good stuff mayne. Professional voice acting. The voices fit the theme in ships ( Ex. TEC Rebel Titian 'I put the laughter in slaughter!'). Everything just fits.   P.S. Whoever voiced the pirate ships deserves a metal.  Story:  Even though this game has no campaign the opening cinimatic really gives you a good feel of the current state of the universe. The whole ambiance of the game gives off a desperate feel. Every race is tired of fighting, but cannot forgive eachother for the horrible atrocities that they committed against eachother (Hence the name Sins of a Solar Empire). Every side will do whatever it takes to win.  If you want to buy this game for story, there really is none besides the opening, sorry, play Mass Effect or something.  Conclusion: This game brings a unique twist to the 4x genre. Providing a slow pased game that keeps you interested and on your toes. It includes a large research tree, many ships to choose from, very diverse races, and very pretty art. Though kinda simple it still holds a place in my heart. This has to be one of the best 4X games I've ever played.  I'd say it's worth buying.  (insert X/10 joke here)     ",

            "review_text": "This game has all the set ups to be one of the BEST strategy games I have ever played. I have been a fan from 2008 of this game. All the way from first release. It has grown to be pure AWESOME when steam got it on its list!  The strategic possibilitys are as endless as are your skills.  -Full out assault (Recomended to beginners) -Increased fleet size and control of planets (Mid style) -Building bad ♥♥♥ star bases to protect your planets and building superior TITAN to increase fleets fire power while maintaining pirate missions on other players trouble and keeping trade routes safe (HARDCORE) -Only your style is the limit!  The games scale is insane in good way! From strike craft size to full galazy just by rolling the mouse wheel 4 times... WOOT?? Yes, you read correctly. The best part is the total control of your full area by super easy way.  Oh yes, did I mention this game is real time. So no need to wait what is gonna happen. And believe me, alot will happen!  I highly recommend to buy those 2 DLC pacs (Forbidden Worlds, Stellar Phenomena) too for they increase the variety of game styles and makes your game even more different with few twist (NOT GONNA SPOIL)  And community drives hard! Online is the best choise for that is where the knowledge is!  Some information about the game itself:  - Tutorial goes from basic to advanced - No missions to play, just full galazys to conquer - Up to 8 factions to choose from with own unique strategys to offer - Unique ship styles -Up to 2000 (!!) fleet supply and that does not inclue strike craft supply! - Up to 8 player maps - Very good selection of maps to choose from. From small map to INSANE over 100 planets and if DLCs inclue... (SPOILER!!)  I let you ofcourse to make the decision but there are only two sides, Allys or rebels... No between!  But to make this bowl of overflowing honey some bittersweet I must warn you: THIS GAME EATS ALOT OF RESOURCES FROM YOUR COMPUTER!!  HARDCORE VETERAN",

            "review_text": "tl;dr: This is good game. Cheap for what you get, lots of mods. Good optimization, much pretty. Music nice, gameplay nice, must play for space RTS fans.    Sins of a Solar Empire is a space RTS with no campaign, but endless replayability. Every game, the universe that the game is played in is randomized, or selected from a premade map (which offer specific challenges to make the game more interesting). There can be many stars in one universe, and each star can have very few or very many planets, asteroids, wormholes, etc.   The game offers a very nice blend of combat, research, and dimplomacy. But research really trumps everything, which leads into one of Sins' flaws...  the difficulty curve . This game will kick your ♥♥♥ if you are a newcomer to the RTS genre, and even if you are a veteran, you will find a good challenge. This game is not for the easily frustrated, because going against AI, or other players, can really pump up the blood pressure sometimes.   The game itself runs very well for my system. I'm running it on an AMD FX 6300 Processor, NvidiaGTX 660, with 8 GB of RAM, and it runs perfectly fine. It is very well optimized and looks beautiful. The backgrounds of space look phenomenal and the ships look pretty good too. Watching the space battles can be so nice to look at that you forget to make sure they are actually doing alright.   Anyway, This game is worth the $40, but I would also cash in for the DLC, because they are very good for the price. The modding potential for this game is amazing as well. If you ever get bored of the basic game, you can just browse the giant selection of quality mods on Moddb. If there is a popular movie/TV/game/book series taking place in space, there is a good possibility that there is a well made mod already created, or being crafted of it.   Thanks for reading, if you got this far, and I hope this review helps, although the fact that there are already 1,000's of positive reviews made for this game should be a clear indication of the quality of Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion.

            "review_text": "I, personally, enjoy this game, and if you are into space combat games at all, you will enjoy Sins of a Solar Empire. The original game was fantastic, and with Rebellion, comes even more fun! Take command of one of three factions, and choose whether you are a Loyalist or a Rebel. Each faction has their own backstory and reasons for why they are fighting, and the sins they are paying for.  The technology trees have been expanded ever so slightly, and the tech from before has been reworked. Perhaps you want to upgrade how effecient your mining is or maybe you want to start broadcasting how amazing your civilization is across space. Choose whether you want to upgrade your ships' weaponry or armor, to field more variations or ships, or build your defenses.  Speaking of ships, they have added in two new classifications: the Corvette and the Titan. The Corvette is a fast little attack ship, sporting a few weapons, and a debilitating effect. They take only a research upgrade to start producing. And then comes the Titan. These behemoths take several research upgrades, not-to-mention an arm and a leg worth of resources to start producing. You can only field one at a time, but these monsters are devastating.  Each faction has one new capital ship as well, which can be of varying use in certain aspects of the game. The original five capital ships have been revamped, with their abilities being reworked and revamped. Not everything has been changed, but a few tweaks have been made, to make sure they are still viable and fun to use.  This is the only part that I still have a problem with: the planetary upgrades. Planets can be upgraded in a handful of different areas, and different types of planets can receive a different number of upgrades, up to a maximum of four. These upgrades can allow a larger planetary population or increasing the number of tactical (defensive structures and the like) or logistical (research platforms, broadcasting stations, shipyards). It could increase the health of the planet (and thus how much damage it can take from enemy bombardment), or explore the planet. This could lead to planetary anomalies that could be beneficial or penalize the planet, or even discover a long-lost artifact, which would have beneficial affects for your empire as a whole. The reason I have a problem with this is because it is too streamlined. Once a planet is upgraded, there is no reason to keep coming back to it, unless it is being attack.  That being said, do I recommend the game? Yes. Absolutely. Gameplay is almost never stale, as the game changes every time you start it again. Anyone that enjoys the aspect of large naval space engagements would positively love Sins of a Solar Empire. And with this 75% off deal going on for this weekend, I would jump at the opportunity.",

            "review_text": "If you noticed the game on a sale and you are either struggling to pay the required amount of money or just looking down the comment section to see if it's worth it... BUY IT. Like a great person and an ultimate memelord once said: 'JUST DO IT!'. This is an RTS video game which main goal is to rule a growing space empire. The game is filled with content, it features real time combat (the unit limit is seriously high, so the battles are not only challenging and exciting but also huge and spectacular) which requires input from the player since you can manage every single ship on the battlefield separately, especially capital ships that will level up after gaining enough XP points and require the player to put some input in the direction of where the upgrade points go. However the game is not only focused on combat unlike the majority of other RTS games with such massive battles. While the battle is going on you can just zoom out and control your empire, send reinforcements or either start an another battle in a different spot. As I mentioned before, not only you have to fight and conquer, but also do research, gather resources, manage the planetary and orbital infrastructure of each planet you own, run a diplomacy between you and other players, give missions to factions or pirates, bribe pirates to strike empires other than yours and do other stuff that a space emperor would do. The point is, there is so much content, such a huge game world (if you feel like a single solar system of 30+ planets isn't enough for you, there is an option to play on a map based on several solar system each one with tens of planets ) with so many planets/sectors to rule and various ways of victory (diplomatic,total annihilation etc.) that it's hard to put everything into a smal steam review. Even though it is an RTS game, the matches can stay up to several hours or days as it is in Civilization V. It makes the game a fun multiplayer production with an option to host a multiplayer lobby and save the game progress so it can get loaded next time you want to play, that's why the game plays the best if you have friends who are willing to play it with you. In a nutshell - it is a fun RTS game with many gameplay possibilities and a great multiplayer module. If you are a fan of RTS games you should definitely get it !",

There isn't much of a story to it except what's told in the intro video. So, there's no story mode, it's just like a skirmish mode, choose a map and go. That kind of sucks but the gameplay makes up for it, there's a lot you can do once you start a game. The game tries to make diplomacy a big concept but fails because diplomacy can largely be ignored. At least for me, diplomacy could have been done better.  It comes with a 'map editor.' I use quotes because it's not really a map editor. It gives you a screen with various settings that you can modify and it auto-creates a map based on those settings. It's essentially just a fancy random map mode.  Not really much else to say... If you want a detailed story mode then this isn't going to be very fun for you. But if you like galactic RTS games then this works great.",

That being said, the games in Sins tend to take anywhere from 40 minutes, to 4 hours, so anyone who wants a shorter, more fast paced experience should look elsewhere.   On a very important side note, the multitude of mods out there can REALLY improve the experience. Three I'd personally recommend are: Sins of a Galactic Empire (A Star Wars based mod), Enhanced 4X, and Sins of the Prophets (Halo based). ",

The basic premise of SOASE is to build a giant army of death bringing spaceships, and ram them as close as you can to other giant armies of death. Repeat steps 1-2 four hundred times and eventually you might get somewhere.  PRO TIP: Have a bigger, more expensive, giant death army than the other players. More likely to win that way.  It may sound repetitive, and it is, but you won't notice as giant lazer beams of death come out of your giant space ship and kills 4 spaceships at once.

Ok Fine  Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion is a unique space RTS games that centers around moving from planet to planet conquering and establishing your empire. The closest thing you can compare this game to is like playing CiV 5 in space, but its in real time.  Other than the homeworld franchise and a little nastalgic empire at war, this is one of the only space RTS games in existence that not only does not suck more than a tai hooker, but it actually pretty well done. Featuring massive and i mean massive battles between fleets of ships by the end game your ships will probably ram into eachother from a siezure because of all the laser beams flying everywhere.  As previously stated you start on 1 planet that revolves around 1 star, you then migrate to neighboring planets exterminating anything you come across around the planet, then you invade and conquer the ♥♥♥♥ out of it like a space age christopher columbus. Maps however can be extremely large, featuring multiple stars, each with their own set of planets revolving around them to conquer and add to the might of your empire.  Oh did i mention when you attack a planet already controlled by another main faction of the game you literally nuke it from orbit (because its the only way to be sure) until everyone dies and you can recolonize it, if that isnt enough for you then i dont know what is.  The reason i also say this game is a real time space version of civ 5 is because the game moves at a slow enough pace that you are playing an RTS, but at the same time you can manage your empire and economy etc with ease. The game also has one of the most well done camera systems ive seen in an RTS game, allowing you can look and go anywhere despite the map being gigantic, all with the simplicity of a scroll wheel.  But seriously, one of the best space rts games in existence, So if you are into either i would absolutely recommend buying it. Ever since i bought the original game its given me YEARS of entertainment.",

You can zoom right in and see your ships shoot lasers and rockets at the enemy, watch your fleet jump into an intense 3D fire-fight, and zoom in on a building that you just destroyed to watch it explode.  You will always be researching armor, weapon, mining, colonization, and diplomatic sciences to improve your empire. Build a variety of ships, defensive structures, and planetary upgrades to improve you empire's spread rate and combat effectiveness.  Overall I would rate this game 9/10.

            "review_text": "WARNING: If you own the other sins game, with expansions, you might want to wait till it's on sale. While this game is very expansive and offers a decent amount from the earlier game, it just feels like an expandalone. Comparing Sins:Entrenchment to this game, not much changes. Yes, there are 'more' factions, yes there are titans. But, thats about it. The mechanics don't change, and the gameplay is about the same. The only thing worth mentioning is that if you play multiplayer, you will most certainly not be allowed to build corvettes in game. This is a result of corvette rushing happening, and the overall cost effectiveness greatly outweighing any other ship. However, that being said, I ♥♥♥♥ing love this game. If you decide to get it, I would reccomend the purchase of the expansions packs. They add quite a bit more depth to the game and make it an overall better experience. This game has everything from a working 'stock market' to galaxy vs galaxy space combat. If you are interested in the RTS genre of games, this is a game for you. While there is a 4X aspect of the game, it is not worth mentioning. Given the only such element of the 4X genre implemented is tech research, which is almost standard in newer RTS games. This game allows you to govern a race of your choosing, then choose a sub faction within that race and start the game. Your goal can be either conquest, diplomacy, economy, research, or even exploration. With a variety of win options and a very in depth diplomatic system, this game has it all. It is very hard to play this game and not enjoy some part of it. Despite it's almost civilization esque times for games, Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion will go down as the greatest space RTS ever created, and my personal favorite.",

            "review_text": "Sins was a game that honestly had me relatively surprised in a number of aspects. Here's my thoughts:  Graphics: 7/10; For a game made more than a couple years ago, it manages to push a rather impressive resolution, detail and ambience. Everything from massive capitol ships and Titans, to small units such as fighter squadrons are well textured, clearly defined and able to give a good visual experience that's both impressive, and incredibly well optimised. So well in fact even older PC's can handle the game on higher graphics levels. Sadly in large scale games with multiple players the game does tend to putz around a bit with the number of items and commands being issued but thats simply a common feature among RTS games.  Gameplay: 8/10; RTS at its finest, with a bit of micro-RPG elements attatched to each ship, the game is fun to play, flows well, and encourages good strategy as well as economy management. The controls are a bit much to take in all at once, and it like many other games involving a 4 tier RTS, requires a bit of a learning curve. However, once understood the game is able to flow well, it rewards tactics and an understanding of your opponent, and a satisfying feeling of accomplishment.  Sound: 5/10; Its an older game, but the sound effects hold up, and are fairly solid. Listening in on battles is an enjoyable experience and the sound levels are accurate. However some of the more notable abilities used by the Titan units seem unnessecarrily loud, and if listening with headphones can be somewhat deafening if zoomed in close to observe the battle.  Addictiveness and Depth: 4/10; The game suffers from one major flaw. Its absolute lack of a single player campaign. The game has all the makings of what could be a very entertaining single player space domination game, however it is restricted to arena style RTS combat over a set number of worlds against 1 - 7 opponents. The game does have an interactive level up system for Capitol ships, which are allowed to level in a manner you can guide them in by increasing their abilities, and the games heavy amount of depth via a diplomacy system, a working active and live economy, as well as player issued missions, falls by the wayside when faced with the knowledge that the entire games structure is simply a Starship based battle arena.  Overall: 6/10; The games very fun if you can settle into its niche setting. Enjoying well detailed space battles happening in real time is difficult to manage especially with the graphical quality this game manages to provide. However the lack of a single player campaign hits this game hard, and pushes it onto a back burner if you're looking to pick it up. Best to get if you know a friend that plays it as well, or if you enjoy the competition of facing down another player in a 3 Tier RTS game. Only reason this game isnt being reccomended is its heavy reliance on other players for any sort of content.",

It improves graphics and mechanics, while adding new ships, technologies, and planet upgrades. its a real-time, 4 dimensional, space strategy game.  you capture planets, and gather resources, while building a fleet to defend your territory and making or breaking alliances with the other factions through diplomacy. you can win a diplomatic victory if you get enough points, which only happens if you keep the right factions happy and attack the otherrs.   now planets can specialize, which is a great addition to a game that needed a focus on the planets. now you can focus a planet on industrial or social production, that gives bonuses to ship production and trade or culture (which sacrifices the other two). this lets you boost production at the heart of your empire while spreading culture at the fringes fast enough to push out others. there are also new types of planets that tend to have increased resources, for example a greenhouse world will have a lot of metal asteroids that let you extract metal faster than other planets.  then there are the new ships the titan and the shriken corvettes (of the terran players) add a new, somewhat irritating element. if you are caught without a titan, and a small fleet, the game is over, they are massive ships with huge health and weapons abilities that have to be researched first and are kind of expensive (each faction has its version). the rebel and loyalist forces now have differing abilities that give bonues to various aspects of gameplay.",

I hated it so much that I actually wrote a script to copy those sounds out to be replaced by sounds that were neutral.  ----- ENOUGH RANTING ALREADY -----  That said, there is also some good voice acting, like 'I hope this isn't another suicide mission!' and when a new colony is founded 'A new colony has been founded' and there's some dramatic orchestral music. 'The price on our heads has increased!' Those I really like, and the more I play the more it grows on me.   The gameplay is simplistic - all the ships do whatever it is they do, and there are minimal choices for changing how they work. And the capital ships have level caps (maybe that's fixed in some mods).  There are a number of mods which I still have to try.  What I like about this game: it goes pretty fast. Unlike SotS or Star Ruler or GalCiv - this feels like it plays much faster. Maybe I'm hallucinating too.

He sees it and thinks it's amazing, I tell him that it is. He gets the game and we immediately begin playing. After about 5 hours of teaching him how to play, he gets tired and leaves.  Now a little bit ago I say we should play again, he is hesitant, but he agrees to anyway. We start up the game and I set everything to faster so he can play a quicker game (faster training, mining, culture.) Everything is going great for the first 10 minutes or so, until we establish first contact.  Now since he is still learning, I have had to teach him up to this point and our technological advancements and colonization have been slow. Not to mention I had to help him learn how to play the Advent as I was playing the TEC. I expected that star to star jumping would be reached within 10 minutes, but they are already here. A couple scouts are not really an issue, so we continue to expand, then my friend is alof a sudden really scared because he had lost one of his colonies. I simply thought he accidentally scuttled it and he was paying attention to his (small) army fighting rebels. It wasn’t until the third colony that I went to investigate. There, I found a HUGE war party in his late colony’s system.  Im freaking out and Telling him to Bring his army back to defend his home world, and that's when I notice that the same this is happening to me. With an army of that size, they must have been expanding into the other galaxies without much trouble, and now we were paying for it.  About 20 minutes later, and 20 minutes of constantly defending our colonies, I have a great idea. I immediately start rushing siege frigates and my titan (the Ragnarov titan is personally my favorite, which is basically a giant rail gun, with engines and smaller guns all around it) and I tell him to do the same. Confused, he has to listen because he has no other ideas.   My idea is to win by sneaking 100 siege frigates and a titan into the enemy territory, and take their home planet before they can gets troops back from the front lines (our colonies). And very soon, the pan is under way. We have literally every single ship, which added together is only a fraction of our enemies army, and send them on a straight shot for his home world. During this time, he has taken almost all of our colonies(be both have about 2 left) and they don’t seem to care that our armies have disappeared.   5 Minutes later, we make the final jump into a heavily fortified system with gauss platforms and mines EVERYWHERE and a fully upgraded starbase. Note that at this point, all of his ships are flying back to save his home planet, but by then it's too late. we destroy his defences and being bombing the planet. Sadly, about half way through destroying it, my friend lost his Capital, and his ships lost all ties with me, but is was too late. The final nuke was fired, sealing his fate as the first of his ships jumped into the system. We had won in probably the most dirty and underhanded way, but we had won.  10/10 would accidentally understand the plot to Ender’s Game. ",

You just have to spend 2 hours building up, so you're ready to fight the enemy, and then it's all settled. The last half hour is just cleanup, or tears, depending on how the big battle went.

Think Empire at War, Endless Space, Galactic Civilizations, or Master of Orion with an updated, streamlined interface, in full 3D (you can zoom to almost any level of magnification), and in Real-Time, and you'll have a good idea of what to expect. The game eschews a traditional single-player campaign in exchange for more emphasis on instanced gameplay, and provides a wide variety of pre-designed maps along with random maps in various sizes and a scenario builder for the more hands-on type. In Rebellion (over and above SINS: Trinity), the three races are here split into two factions apiece, each with unique technologies and units, without sacrificing the careful balance among the factions. Additionally, Rebellion includes the immense Titans, a large, expensive combat ship which moves and levels like a capital ship but has the strength and stamina of a starbase. The Forbidden Worlds DLC adds three additional planet types (all of which require research to colonize and have particular strategic value), while the Stellar Phenomena DLC adds a number of non-colonizable objects, as well as some hazards and environmental events to create a less predictable experience. Both are a little expensive for what you get, though they're interesting additions nonetheless.  In short: Sins is pretty much the best game of its kind out there - if you're a fan of the strategy/4X game, you should absolutely give it a look.",

            "review_text": "I like the idea of this game, 4X mixed with RTS. But I just don't like this game, I wonder why. I hate double DRM, but it's not the reason. This game lacks a complete tutorial or campaign/story mode, but well it's OK, I normally only play a few campaign battles in RTS games, then only play skirmish once a while.  As a 4X game, SOSE don't give you much time for planning. This game has a big tech tree, and in 4X games I usually take a few minutes to think about which tech direction I want to go at the beginning, but the realtime gameplay just doesn't let me. Well if you played a lot it could become as easy as muscle memory but still, if it is a 4X game, player should have some time for planning.  Star development and ecnomics are simplified a lot compared to other 4X games. More like RTS: Build mining drones, improve the population, build factories, build defence platforms. And then, build as many ships as you can.  Diplomacy seems totally broken. AI hates you at the beginning if you are a different faction. In most 4X games when you meet alien ship, the first thing is a greeting, but here when your fleet meet theirs, they just start firing at each other AUTOMATICALLY, and it hurts relationship. You have to research technology to communicate with AI, before that you may already at war, and even when you finished that technology and offer AI pacts and trades, they just laugh at you and refuse. The only thing you can do to improve relationship is complete their missions, which are usually to attack others, so there is actually no peace play. (If you don't complete them, relationship also gets worse) And AIs just gradually become friendly with each other, because they don't do missions.  As a RTS game, SOSE's battle is very slow paced. It could take a minute to move from one star system to another, with normal game speed setting. And you can only move through certain lanes. So it could take minutes to send reinforcement, and when your fleet gets there the battle is already over.  The fleet battles themselves also looks boring: you move fleets into a star system that has enemies there, and ships just automatically move to each other and start firing. You can control ship movement and manually choose target, but it doesn't help that much: Ship maneuver is super slow compared to projectiles and lasers attack range, you always fight in open space, and often get surrounded at the point you enter a star system. You can't see formations in traditional RTS games here, it's mostly just numbers and rock-paper-scissors that matters: You get more ships, you win. One ship type is stronger against another, you build right things, you win. Furthermore, you upgrade to more advanced tech and get more big ships, you win. Once the battle starts, you can only retreat your fleet, or watch the result. That's good if this is a pure 4X turn based game, but RTS elements are added in, and doesn't work as expected.  The graphics isn't bad, it's quite good considering this is released some years ago. Problem is, you don't have chances to really see details like the screenshots above, if you're playing normally. You would take half your time watching the star map. Clicking on systems to build ships and upgrades. And another half, controlling your fleets moving from here to there, (and this can also be done in the star map interface) and micromanaging fleet battles. Even when you zoom into a star system to control your ships, they look as small as ants. Ship attack range is super long compared to their size, when you zoom in until you can see details, you can't do anything but only watching.  Combining 4X and RTS looks like a good idea, but the 2 elements turn out to be conflicted with each other in many aspects. I think this game did its best, but I don't see it solves all the problems. It's like they put a simplified RTS and a simplified 4X together, and I can't enjoy either of them.",

I can't even give it away because of the painstakingly long gameplay that everyone else seems to be aware of. I'm 13 hours in and I still have no grasp of the game. Even worse, an average game lasts 3-4 hours at regular speed and I have yet to claim honest victory to a single match, let alone completed one.

            "review_text": "In Sins of a Solar Empire the most defining feature is that it is very complex, while staying very clean and almost simplistic, not letting s**t get in the way of your 4x rts experience. The game is built for online team vs team pvp. It is not my cup of tea which is why I did not give it my recommendation. But for some people it will be the perfect game.   Best part: Many different and viable strategic approaches to playing, allowing different styles and forcing adaptations to win. Also on a small note there are detailed graphs and stats collected then presented at the end of the game that my friends and I would just pour over for fun.   Worst Part: each game is the most awkward of lengths, usually most good games are around 5 hours. This might not sound like much, but it has been killer in my appetite for the game as it is too long to play in one sitting, but too short to really justify splitting it into parts (and good luck doing that with a multiplayer game anyways). And on a side note, most of the game will be spent zoomed out pretty far so you will just be looking at boring little colored ship icons instead of the actual vessels or graphics.   Overall, the thing that really ruined my enjoyment of Sins of a Solar Empire the most is the lack of immersion (for some people this might be a benefit). The clean, ordered, and perpetually zoomed out nature of the game may benefit smooth and efficient strategy, but it comes at the cost of any real sense of immersion, and so I find it really hard to get into. When your capitol planet is being bombed into the dirt and your cities are being nuked from orbit as your people die by the millions, all you really see are decreasing population stats and movement of an indicator on a slider. Plus, the voice actors are terrible.  UPDATE: I have played a lot more 4x space strategy games since my first review, and have found that many of the things that I complained about here are standards of the genre. Which kind of sucks. And it also lets me see that this game is even more weird than I first thought. It exists in between the kind of 4x games that are campaign games that explore empire building and rts games made of small matches like Starcraft, and instead of being a cool blend its an awkward hybridization and it shows us why such games do not exist.",

I was intrigued and I wanted to play the game to find out more about the story. After buying this game and playing it, I found that this has no story, no single player to further the back story or plot. Instead it has an incredibly stale tutorial, and fairly boring pvp game play. I guess maybe I should have bought the original game from 1998 or whenever. Maybe if they had a single player aspect to the game to drive the plot, that they have on their website, then I can be excited and want to play it more. As it is, this game gets a double thumbs down.",

Disbelieve all reviews that claim it is epic space strategy like a MoO or something. It's not  Review: Sins of a Solar Empire is time and resource management RTS focused primarily on multiplayer. There is no single campaign, only skirmishes.  As the game focused in this area it lacks depth pretty much everywhere.   Pros: Good graphics. Different factions, ships, techs. Average sound. Overall faction balance, except pirates.  Cons: Everything else. Really. - Shallow, silly research trees.  - Limits on the space construction in the system. - AI cheats - no Single player campaign - dumbest achievements ever - overpowered pirate faction - ridiculous maps - very severe limits on the amounts of ships in game - price, DLC prices - very clunkly and messy UI. I had to lover resolution on 24' display to be able to read fonts and see icons from a meter away! - diplomacy, totally pointless and confusing as hell  Conclusion: This is a game for quick online skirmishes, and if this is your thing, go ahead buy it. But if you are like me, fan of strategies with deep elements and ability to manage and plan and conduct spying and diplomacy missions, this simply is not your game.  For me, it's money wasted :(",

In conclusion this game is fun. It is fun to watch your newly outfitted starbase destroy a small hostile fleet. It is fun to manipulate pirates and other empires into serving your every whim. It is also fun to create vast fleets and titans in order to slaughter your enemies. It is not without flaws and takes several hours of dedication in order to mastermind a huge fleet vs fleet battle, but when you do it is glorious to behold. Worth your time and money.  8/10 fun, beutiful and addictive but not quite perfect.",

They all have their own Titans too, which are essentially a fleet within themselves; none of which are overpowered or god like. Although some do come close *cough* Ragnarov *cough*   Every playthrough is diffirent, none will ever be the same thanks to the random events and generation fo planets and what each planet contains, sometimes a planet can actually be a hinderance to keep ahold of, costing you money and resources just to keep a nice supply route open or an advantagous location. This offers the game some reality. Finally there is the AI, you can have it low were it's barely a sweat to defeat them. And then there is the highest difficulty...

You develop your planet to increase income, build structures in the perimeter of the planet, you build fleets, expand to new planets or solar systems and fight against your enemies in big ship to ship battles and try to destroy all their planets. What I like most of this game, is the great amount of mods, available for this game, introducing popular sci-fi genres to the game, which is a lot of fun. The best experience, at least for me, comes from the multiplayer. You can open trade alliances with others, you can form pacts and go for stronger enemys together. Best played eith friends for some fun rounds of back and forth. Note, that rounds usually take several hours to finish, where the functiunality, to save multiplayer games comes in handy. If you are into big scaled space combat, I would definitely recommend, giving this a shot, if you are fan of those big sci-fi genres out there, like Star Trek for example, there are several good mods, that add a lot to the game.",

But it has a few large downsides such as your large dependance on warfare tactics. Of cource you can put in a lot of efffort to win via culture or economics, but chances are the Ai will be massing just off screen. Again i like warfare strategy as much as the next person but it always seems to boil down to 'my gun is bigger than your gun' which can get a little tedious. Sins has tryed to bypass this by adding experience and abilities to your larger ships so they have a chance of winning two vs one.  For all you backstory lovers out there; Sins has a little of that too explaning who the different factions are and why they came to be, this cauld foreshadow a next Sins as we have yet to meet the fore that wiped out the Vasari.

You build resources by capturing and colonizing planets. There isn't a tech tree so much as a research library you unlock as you colonize planets. Capital ships gain abilities and are upgraded as they gain experience. The planet-by-planet map style lends itself to much more strategic planning. And the large weapon, the 'Titan,' each civilization can build is an immensely valuable asset which is balanced really well. Units are controlled in a 2D plane but move in 3D on their own.

            "review_text": "Sins of a Solar Empire – Rebellion: This title is too long already  I was originally going to name this review, “Hold on, I just need to nuke their entire population” But then the title would have been like an entire paragraph and… Honestly, I couldn’t be bothered. But that would have been a great title because that’s basically been my experience with this game so far. Casually asking my friend to kill entire planet’s worth of people in exchange for military support, resources, or just because they’re annoying.  Just because I am bad guy, doesn’t make me a bad… guy.  I bought this game during the Christmas sale on Steam last year, but hadn’t played it until like Tuesday of last week, that is to say on or around the 15th of March. Remember when I played Helldivers for like fifteen hours over a weekend with my buddy? Yeah… Same thing here. Sins of a Solar Empire is pretty dope. I played about five or six games over spring break, and enjoyed every minute of it.  Sins has been on my radar since the original came out back in like… 2008, wait let me check… Yeah it was 2008. I’ve always thought it looked dope, but never took the plunge. Well, I can say that it was definitely worth the wait. It’s a lot like a real time Endless Space, crossed with Supreme Commander. Except it’s approachable and is just deep enough to be rewarding, and ‘lite’ enough to be easily grasped without being daunting.  The game centers around … well I actually don’t know the story, but what I do know is the game sports three factions, each with a Loyalist and Rebel side. Which means in gameplay terms, that there are six factions. Although the Loyalist and Rebel sides are similar, they have different research that allows differentiated gameplay. Like for example, there are giant fleets of space Pirates present on the star map. They will put bounties on players and eventually attack them. And although you can manipulate it by placing bounties yourself, if you’re on the receiving end of the attack, it can drastically hamper your success in the game.  The TEC Rebel faction can become allies with the Pirates, completely negating the disadvantage. Not only will they not attack you, but the Brigands surrounding un-colonized planets basically become free body guards. It’s incredibly powerful, if not a bit overpowered.  And although each faction has ships that fill the same archetypes, their style of play definitely makes them all feel distinct. After playing each, one you will quickly get a feel for their strengths and weaknesses. They all feel unique but familiar– which is nice. It’s not hard to jump from the TEC to the Vasari, or the Vasari to the Advent.  And while the game does have many different win conditions, I found that it’s best suited for ANNIHILATION! Or rather, that’s how we played, because we’re noobs and blowing things up is easier than talking to them.  And while the game is definitely more approachable than other 4X games I have played, it does still have many of the quarks that that are always present in the genre. Such as the ‘culture’ system, which is interesting to say the least. You build massive orbital Media Hubs around your planets and they blast your Media through the star systems, spreading your culture into the surrounding planets. This will lower the enemy planet’s allegiance and presumably convert them to your empire at some point.  Hearts and minds.  But all that aside, my twenty hours were spent committing horrible genocide across the galaxy. Paul Atreides, Muad’dib– lamented that his forces spread across the galaxy and killed sixty billion in a needless Jihad.  Child’s play.  Why go to an enemy planet when you can bombard it with interstellar nuclear missiles? “Hey, I’ll bombard their capital if you send reinforcements to my planet.” And then billions died.  The scope of Sins of a Solar Empire is certainly one of the stronger points of the game. The maps range from a handful of planets around one star. To Hundreds of planets around dozens of stars. In some cases the game feels intergalactic rather than merely interstellar. And it’s definitely compelling to think about launching a massive three fleet invasion into another galaxy. Taking it one hard fought planet at a time, systematically dismantling what could only be centuries of hard work. But I have an overactive imagination… Also they started it.  Sins focuses heavily on the Macro aspect of things, which lends itself well to the Supreme Commander comparison. There isn’t really much that you can do on a micro level; other than the positioning of planetary defenses, such as mines and missile platforms. But other than a few abilities the Capital Ships have, most ships are capable of taking care of themselves. They don’t require commands other than to retreat or to focus fire. If you’re more into the micro aspect of RTS games, then sins might not be for you. It’s definitely more of an abstracted “Big Picture” type of game.  But despite there not being a lot to do in moment to moment combat, there is a surprising amount of plates to spin. Especially when you’re Empire stretches across more than a handful of worlds. You need to make sure your trade routes are properly constructed, that your outer planets are properly defended, while also defending your inner planets. You need to be sure to actually develop your worlds to increase the population and rake in more tax income. You need your centers of production to be near the active areas of your empire; otherwise your fleets won’t be able to respond in time if there is an attack.  One of the things that really adds to the scope, but could definitely turn people off… Is that it takes forever to get anywhere in Sins. And while it doesn’t necessarily bother me… It could take upwards of ten minutes for your fleets to arrive at their destination. Maybe even longer depending on the size of your Empire. And as far as I can tell there isn’t a way to make them travel between planets faster, other than being the Vasari– but that’s a different story.  There have been many occasions where my friend needed support to defend a planet from an invading fleet. And I would try to send reinforcements, only to have the battle be over by the time I reached the next system over…. Space is big, yo.  But I really don’t have a lot of negative things to say about this game. It’s just a big fun space war simulator; and I really enjoy that. It’s not trying to be something it isn’t. There’s enough there to be entertaining, and it’s just deep enough to hold your interest. It’s like a lean beef Po’Boy sandwich, it might not be the best sandwich ever… But it sure does hit the spot…  You should check it out, at the time of this writing it’s currently on sale too!

I've played all factions, but my favourite are Vasari Loyalists. With them I'm able to play Battlestar Galactica style games on highest difficulty, where I'm quickly conquered and remnants of my fleet (VL can survive with no planets as long as you have necessary techs and a Titan-class ship) have to fly from one planet to another to escape their destruction, regroup and crush their enemies.   In some games I was left with only one, badly damaged Vorastra Titan and no other ships and after many hours of mostly running away from my enemies, finally crush them :) With right techs, Vorastra has the ability to 'construct' ships in deep space, so as long as you can find resources, you can rebuild your fleet.   Other factions are fun too. Advent with their psi-technology was my favourite faction until Rebellion expansion, which introduced Titan-class ships and Vasari Loyalists enabled BSG-style games.

Starting criteria such as fleet sizes, economy rates, research rates, and many more can be tweaked. -Real time combat: Battles can be long, drawn out, and at such a large scale - very rewarding. Fleets of hundreds and hundreds of ships can meet each other in battle if you time it correctly. -Research: Research differs quite a bit from race to race, with each having strengths and weaknesses. The research trees are fairly extensive and divided into subgroups (such as economy, military, civilian, defense, etc), so you can choose the path you wish to follow first. Research isn't fluff, and has a significant impact on gameplay. -Aesthetics: The fleet of each race differs greatly once you get into making larger ships, and the graphics are more than passable. The game also runs very smoothly even during intense combat. -Diplomacy: Coming very close to a Masters of Orion style diplomacy, with unlocked teams you can sway your opponents or allies to perform tasks for you or manipulate them in many different ways. Some research is dedicated solely to diplomacy.  Weaknesses -Online Play: Finding a community of players to game with can be difficult. Often, there are very few people to game with and IronClad online goes down sometimes... this also leads into next weakness. -AI: The AI in this game isn't the worst I've seen, but it could be improved. Because it's hard to find other players, if you want to play you are often stuck with AI. The biggest difficulty in this is the differences between AI settings. The AI can be somewhat inconsistent. Weak to Normal to Strong is a huge jump, and if you crush Normal settings, there's a very good chance you'll get crushed versus Strong settings. The small bonus to this is that the AI isn't too easy across the board, and if you crank up the difficulty it will mostly likely smash you. -Planets: While controlling planets is a primary goal in the game, planet customization is very simple and takes a back seat to fleet research and gameplay in general. -Endgame: This game can play out many different ways, but often you know you're going to win well before you wipe out the other factions and the game ends. Sometimes 20-30 minutes beforehand. This can lead to very anti-climactic victories.  If you like RTS, you WILL like this game. Replayabliity level is high if you're a RTS fan. If you have fond memories of playing Homeworld or Homeworld 2, you should definitely pick up this game.",

As an RTS it is somewhat simplified in many of its strategic and logistics elements (most notably with planet management); this frees your attention to manage the fights. And they can be huge towards the end game, as fighters, corvettes, frigates, cruisers, capital ships, and maybe even a titan duke it out. The capital ships in particular are a unique take, borrowing the 'hero unit' standard from fantasy RTS's and bringing them to 4X. Besides being bigger and badder than regular ships, capital ships have unique powers on cooldown to damage, stun, heal, and more. Fortunately, most can be set on 'autocast' to reduce your micromanagement load.  The battles themselves are really pretty to watch. The game lets you zoom out to see the entire galaxy, then rapidly zoom in to a ship or even a single fighter craft. Enjoy sitting behind one of your laser frigates as it goes toe-to-toe with the enemy. (in reality you won't have time to zoom in like this during the game, unfortunately -- good thing you can save your replays!) The engine is a little dated, but Stardock has done a good job squeezing all they can out of it with successive expansions, Rebellion being the latest version and, probably, the last.  The scope of the game can range from fewer than 10 systems with 2 empires, to 10 players fighting over literally hundreds. There are plenty of dev-designed maps that come with the game, or you can easily create your own with one of two map-creation systems (one easy, one harder but more powerful). You can establish front lines once you are dug in well enough with starbases, or you can rush the enemy before they can dig in themselves. There is diplomacy with the AI if you want it (mostly involving bribing them to be on your side), or you can lock teams at game creation.   I could go on, but you really need to play the king of the 4X to make up your own mind. It is on sale frequently -- it is worth the wait!   (Its only real competition for the title of king: Sword of the Stars, which self-immolated with one of the worst sequals since Highlander 2, and GalCiv which never really struck a nerve the way Sins did.)",

A lot of games have one bad faction that no one likes, well there are no bad factions in this game. *Beautiful graphics. For the scale of this game, the visuals are amazing and you don't need a super computer to run it. *High replayability. I love how every game turns out differently, even against the same AI on the same difficulty on the same map multiple times. *I have never expirienced a glitch the entire time I played this game.  Cons Very minute and no adverse effects on game play. *The price. While I feel this game is worth $40, a lot of my friends are unwilling to pay that much for a game they don't know very much about. *Some features are a little off as far as graphics go. The ship to planet size ration is off, but that's a good thing for game play, a massive planet would dominate the screen and get in the way, so this one benefits game play. *DLC is not very exciting  Overal: 97/100 If you are looking for a new game, look no further. this game will absorb you. It is by far one of my favorite games and outstanding edition to the scifi/space genre as well as the 4X/RTS genre.",

This game can be so simple or advanced, which ever you want. if you want a simple game just do a smaller map with fleet size, resources max. if you want an advanced game do a huge map with normal or low bonuses.  One of my favorite parts of this game is the diversity. 3 races with unique bonuses and 2 factions with race, both having more specific strategies. like the tec. there are the tec rebels and loyalists. the loyalists want to stay by themselves and have huge defensive bonuses. But the rebels are very aggressive and have aggressive bonuses, like being allies with pirates. This huge diversity causes each game to be different and random.  The combat system is good, the only complaint i have is how easy it is to spam, especially in the start. There are regular ships, capital ships and then titans. each race gets unique capital ships and each faction gets a unique titan, further increasing the diversity. You get your first cap free so you have to decide with one suits you best, rushing to your enemies with a heavy or settling the planets around you with a colony capital ship, the choice is yours. The leveling up of the titans and capital ships is another thumbs up. It allows each capital ship to take a certain roll in the fleet by unlocking and upgrading skills. Like the Advent colony ship able to restore shields of friendly ships around it.  The research trees i find amazing. there is so much research options, each race having a unique one that can suit a number of strategies. you guessed it, each factions get certain unique research options, like the tec rebels able to research nearly every tec weapon with tec loyalists can increase armor in friendly planets or having two starbases around a planet. Very well done.  Overall i give this game a 9/10 only for the huge learning curve and some balancing issues. Warning, if you do get this game there IS a huge learning curve, just be patient with it and it gets SOO much better. If any newbies have any questions i would be glad to help!  Funny story, when i first started a game in this i kept trying to put down a building and trying to build a ship, it wouldnt so i rage quit and didnt try the game for another few days. looking back on it i realized that i wasnt in my system! so it wasnt my stuff i was clicking.",

It has so much deepness in every aspect in this game that I played more than 60 hours and still didn't get it all, not because it's complicated, but that I tried to play at least 2 times with all the 6 factions in the game, and they are soo different from each other, even from the same race like the rebels and loyalists have unique gameplays and strategies with their unique researches and boosts(i had to stop playing few moths ago and returned now, this may be turned more difficult for me to get better in this game)  The research tree is huge and so complex, since the amount of resources are not so easily given, and you must find out the best ones for your gameplay in the early game.  You may think that combat in this game is simple, build ships, select, and hit the button but it isn't. So many ship types in this game, each one with their weaknesses and strengths. Positioning in the gravity well and around your empire is crucial to have a good offencive and defensive game.  Difference between races are so great, and i can't decide wich one i like most, even though I'm beginning to realize that my favorite are the Vasari, with their Phase Stabilizers and Mobile Starbases, are more suitable for my type of gameplay, but the abilities of the Advent and the commercial and army capabilities of the Tec are very attractive as too.",

As far as the gameplay goes, this will delight newcomers to the genre and hardened veterans alike, with the various factions and different playstyles you have access to, each with their own benefits and drawbacks. I personally find the Advent Rebels the most fun to play, but that's a matter of opinion. :) Combat in this games takes place over the span of one or several star systems, each with a wide variety of planets. The map size is nothing to complain about either, up to 10 players and 132 individual planets. There are many types of ships at your disposal to conquer your enemies with, from the humble scout frigate, used to explore and find new planets, to the Titan, capable of taking on entire fleets at once. Micromanagement and fleet planning is definitely reccomended to get the most mileage out of your ships during battle.  The only true downside to this game is the sheer amount of time that multiplayer games can drag on for, depending of course on the skill of your opponent(s), and the map size. The ability to have a vote to change the speed of an MP game, similar to Empire Total War, would definitely reduce the drag of playing online matches.  Have you always wanted to rule the galaxy, and have a blast while doing it? If so, this game is for you! 9/10   ",

It's got very deep strategy at play here when you're looking at trying to beat the game at higher difficulties or against palyers.  A massive, expansive, multi-tiered, multi-way tech tree. It requires scholarly study and in game experience to actually understand which path to go down... or which ships to build, which planets to take, when to attack, how to attack etc. This game requires the user to play a good 15 hours before they actually have a good grasp of what to do.  but once you have your game plan it's incredible fun.  No one part of the game is highly complex, but, there are so many slightly complex parts interacting that the whole can become un-managable and before you know it the normal ai have slaughtered you. Start on easy difficulty to learn the ropes.  the battles are a spectacle, enable cinematic mode and sit back to see your massive ships fight over worlds. It's graphically pleasing though late game, due to problems with the game engine not registering multiple CPU cores (or something) the game lags. I reccomend playing the game on normal or fewer ship numbers.  It's not the sort of 4x game you play then throw away, I'll be comign back to this bad boy time and time again.",

            "review_text": "Let's talk shop here. I have played the original Sins of a Solar Empire, long ago when it was just a disk game for the PC, long before Steam was even a thing. I was amazed at the flexibility of the game. I loved how you could choose how to play and win. Sure you could be super agressive and just go out and kill the enemy, or you could be super slick and just flood the enemy planets with your culture and just wait for the inevitable. And there were many other routes you could take. This has transfered over amazingly well to Rebellion. I have been keeping my eyes on the series for a while now, and while I may not have been able to play the other itarations (all of which I hear earned star studded accolades) I will say this about SoaSE Rebellion... this game is the quintacential space RTS. They developed a winning strategy with the original Sins and have only perfected it over the years. With stunning visual quality for a RTS, a delightful soundtrack (also the use of a dynamic sound playlist), robust AI's (playing on anything higher then hard is still almost impossible for me), humorous and interesting voice acting, and DLC that actually warrents its price tag... Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion is a must have for any RTS fan. The addition of Titans is the most interesting and rewarding part though. With their immense size (and cost) the feeling of accomplishment when they are finally constructed is palpable. So, let's talk about multiplayer. Like any good RTS game, the fun does not stop at the single player level. The community may be small, but there are players out there who love to play against one another on Sins, and I must say, teaming up on a cruel AI or against one another is supremely satsfying. Although, there is something that needs to be noted... the difficulty of setting up a lobby on the game is notable. Beware, if your computer is not very amazing, you would be best to just join a game. Final Verdict? 8.5/10 Insanely fun, and plenty hard. (though a bit too hard for the more casual gamer) If you like space, or RTS's... you need this in your collection, hell, go back and play the first one, it will blow your mind at how old it is and how it's still so good.",

It has realatively good tutorials, however they could've done a tutorial on how to manage your empire's fleet upkeep, for that was my worst enemy when I first played. Once you build up your empire and engage in other players or AI players, you can sit back and turn the cinematic setting on, adoring the beauty of your armada triumphing or watch it's spectacular destruction. The unit voices are passable, but they could have done more effort for voice actors and there is some wasted potential for this game. For example, they could have expanded the lore of the game aside from some scattered loading screens.

If you're looking to hop into a space battle with your buddies or against a bunch of A.I players, this game is for you.  Update: The above review still stands today(6/27/16), however due to the age of the game, the modding community has dried up to nothing. Also pay no mind to the 'hours played' on here, I've been playing this game far longer than it has been on steam and only repurchased it a couple years ago.",

            "review_text": "So I do not usually do reviews, but this game earned it. I have been getting tired of the half completed or just plain old spent more time on the trailer then the game, space RTS/4x games.  Pros: Game feels complete. DLC add to the game, not just finish it. Game setting really changes the pace and how a match is played. Its a quick learn but gets quite deep when you start to learn complex strategy. Great AI, not sure if it was random but i actually got my superior fleet baited into a dead end system away from the jump point. Space battles can take time but thats cool, you can use the time send reinforcements or gauge how much damage will be done to your fleet. Im sure your getting the point  Cons: I have to suggest a SSD for quick game starts and map building. Late game performance suffers on large maps. Fleet formation could use some work with getting them to face a direction (my thoughts are on this because fleets do better when settled down facing a charging fleet). Diplomacy does seem like an after thought.  Final thoughts: Considering I bought this game only for the purpose of playing the ST Armada 3 mod as well the Galactic Empire mod, and i havent even installed them yet. I must say im enjoying this title far more than I would like to admit. If your looking for your next Space Empire RTS give this one a look.",

It does lean more towards RTS than 4X, with limited planetary developement and no ground invasions. And no ship designer. But exploration and space battles are aplenty. Ignore my hours played, I spent hundreds of hours on the non steam version from stardock from back in 2008 or so, long before they introduced the super capitol Titan ships. And loved it enough to buy it again.  Anyway, it's a beautiful game, runs on old systems fairly well and with multiple factions (6) that play fairly differently. And have I mentioned the space battles? It's well worth a look in. And certainly a good buy if you can get it during a sale. Now I just have to wait for a Sins of a Solar Empire 2.",
