The game is clunky and hard to build. Selling items isn't automatic and just becomes annoying after awhile. I tried the campain which was lacking any substance and didn't give me the desire to contiue to play. Simply put, I'm horrified that I spent money on this game and beg steam to give a refund.",

            "review_text": "I cannot judge the actual quality of the economical simulation, if you don't mind the game slapping you accross the face, you may proceed and play it. The problem is that Industry Empire isn't fun to use/play. I admit I didn't go as far as actually finish the whole tutorial (played half an hour), big flaws emerged far before it ended.  Claiming a land requires drawing a free polygon within which you can construct only rectangular based buildings. This system implies messy placement, clumsy space optimisation, lack of 'snap into place' that'd have actually helped the player play the game (maybe the devs thought using square/hexagonals cells was so 90s... I dunno). Drawing the roads is a nightmare, without any clear indication whether they effectively connect or not with the building. Again, free placement, no hint, no idea what you're doing right or wrong.  The GUI doesn't completely work either. I suspect some bugs, but it also doesn't work on from the ergonomy standpoint. What's the use of both a Reset button and a Cancel button where the Reset button actually Cancels everything you just did? And do we really need scrollbars on which you cannot click to page up/page down?  During placement, say during road placement, you can select buildings on which you missclick without even leaving the placement tool. Now what?  The game looks and feels like a pain to play. I would recommend playing Banished again. Good UI, solid, fun to play. It might not be as rich as this one but it works just fine.  I can't just have a clear opinion on the price tag, but it feels like 30€ is a bit too much for what we end up with.",

But i have to add the game is NOT that horrible as you may think on the basis of reviews. So if you are a fan of a genre and like steam achievements then wait for a discount and buy. If you like such games and don't care about steam achievements and do not oppose piracy then torrent it If you are not a fan and just looking for some game to play then look somewhere else.  Still i think this game is worth a try but i vote for not recommended since it still has many drawbacks",

            "review_text": "Broken and tedious with a clunky interface.  Among the bugs I've encountered so far: Tutorial won't advance, Can't get milk resource (thus disallowing everything you can make from milk) and a random clash bug. Since I've played for 6 hours, that's 1 bug every two hours.  The graphics are the latest 2004 has to offer (minor complaint)  The interface is reptition and click heavy. You'll find yourself doing the same tasks over and over requiring far too many clicks to do the simple things (like sending a truck on a delivery)  The sandbox mode, 'Freeplay,' allows for just 3 different maps. But I suppose that since there isn't much to this game anyway, that's more than enough.  Anyway, as far as game play goes, you build your buildings, connect them with a road building tool that takes a lot of getting used to, make sure the buildings have enough workers, power and water... then flip through the market looking for good prices that you have enough resources to fulfill... And that's about it.",
