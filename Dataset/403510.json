            "review_text": "The name alone caught my attention, I love fairy tales! The game proved to live up to my expectations and was a lot of fun.  The story is simple, you're on a quest to stop an evil force from bringing Giants back down to Earth and also save Jack. Jack is a young boy who traded his cow for magic beans, when one of the beans grows into a huge beanstalk he is captured. You proceed to meet the Guardians and aid them on your journey and they help you to stop the evil one and free Jack. With the giant destroyed everyone is happy! The bonus chapter is basically you finding the remaining magic beans so the same thing doesn't happen again.  There aren't many surprises in the story, even the identity of the evil one isn't a shock. The game play is solid hidden item fare, though items are scattered around main areas for you to find so it all feels like one big hidden item game with a few puzzles thrown in. Oddly enough, the bonus chapter does not follow the same formula, it's more traditional. Either way, it's fun and offers some challenge. Though the game is a bit easy, especially if your a veteran of this genre.  It's fully voiced with lovely artwork but it's short and easy. It's still a great game and would be a great one for young children. Older players may want to wait for a sale price, however.",

I love the fact that you have to create items of use instead of them just being there for you to click on. Absolutely recommend this if you're looking for a twist on the normal HOG!",

Pros: Gorgeous graphics  Cons:  Lackluster plot Puzzles were too simplistic  I've played a lot of this publisher's games, and this one just doesn't do it for me. I never really felt invested in the game, mentally or emotionally, and completed it just to complete it, as opposed to finding out what happens in the story. Not the best Artifax Mundi has published.",
