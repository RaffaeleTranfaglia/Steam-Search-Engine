            "review_text": "Watch Dogs provides a rather enjoyable experience once you get past the rather shotty performance that this game provides along with other nusances. The story is enjoyable although appears to happen at a faster pace then what should have. I did have a lot of fun with this game but I will not recommend this game because of the technical problems that this game has. If you have a new computer with top notch performance then this performance problems might not be there at all but that is for another discussion.  In regards the the performance, the game provides tons of microstuttering and frequent framerate drops that can harm you ability to perform well in the game. This is after the game has been out for a while. Actually, recently after taking a break, this game just randomly freezes and becomes unplayable. I have seen no improvement but actually a degredation of the performance.  The rendering distance for static objects is perfectly fine but there is absolutely horrifying draw distance for dynamic objects such as cars, bikes, and things that you could crash into when doing high speed manuverse in a vehicle. This is utterly annoying and ends up being a slap in the face because it ends up being entirely random to when you crash rather then based on your ability to drive.  The driving mechanics for a keyboard are good but could be better but the crux of the problem is that the physics for your car as compared to others feels different. What I mean by that is you can run right into a car and then drive off while leaving the other car completely destroyed. Somehow your car altough being the exact same in every way can simply drive off. Your character can simply get up from anything and there is no feeling of vunerability.  The gunplay is good in that it doesn't have any major problems but it doesn't excel in any particular way that any other game hasn't already done equally as well. The number of weapons feels just about right and they feel unique in their own right. Unlocking some of the weapons and having others weapons readily purchaseable feels like a nice touch.  A variety of minigames are there throughout the game. Some of them may not be enjoyable depending on your tastes but I essentially see these games as pretty in depths games in themselves. Completing these can unlock things for the main game. I personally enjoyed them quite a bit.  The storyline is a moderate length and begs a sense of urgency so I found myself completing several missions at once then forcing myself to take a lengthy breaks from the main storyline so that I could unlock other guns and tools that I might need during the main storyline. Certain plotholes are in the story that could have been avoided by not attempting to simply write off all other possible solutions especially when there are perfectly valid solutions taking a different route.  Multiplayer works out pretty being seamless for the most part. I did not participate very much in this because I did not personally find it to my tastes but it is pretty cool to realize that someone is tailing you and then take them out.",

Furthermore the aim assist is forced, which makes aiming with mouse at enemies even worse. Another issue with mouse control is random slowdowns/speedups, which make you miss even more shots. It's like the game shows you the middle finger everytime you try to use a mouse. The only way to play this game is with a controler, which defeats the purpose of even playing a third person shooter on PC. And yes I did try all the available fixes online, like editing the config file, it just doesn't work, the aim with mouse in this game doesn't feel right at all.",

            "review_text": "I bought it the day after it came out, and it was a disaster for everyone. As a Chicagoan seeing all of the trailers and the view of the skyline from Millenium Park (in-game), I expected a realistic map of Chicago. Besides the view from Millenium Park, nothing is the same as the real city. The game places Chicago on a few small islands with mountains all around it besides the one suburb in the game. The suburb (I can't remember what its called) is much too country-ish considering the Chicago area's urban crawl radiates from the city. There aren't mountains anywhere near Chicago, either. The game's 'South Side' isn't really a spectacle, either.  As many other people have pointed out, the graphics didn't live up to their hype either. The skyscrapers should be casting long shadows over the streets, but instead, the sun shines over the whole city! At E3, Ubisoft presented remarkable graphics and shaders.  Other than that, the game lacked features that many people call essential. For one thing, there is only one save slot, and within that save slot is both your data for offline AND online play. This means that you could have maxed out everything in both, and upon restarting the campaign, you lose all of your online progress as well. You also cannot replay missions without going through the entire rest of the campaign again. Additionally, there is no console or modding ablility to resolve the game's issues.  As an added bonus, the campaign is exceptionally... short. Once again, the advertising was misleading. I expected a long story about cracking down on human trafficking and illegal drug use, but instead it follows a guy killing everyone in his path to avenge his family's murder. The side missions are all cookie-cutter copies of the same thing in different locations around the city, and they all provide similar benefits. Earning money is incredibly easy in this game, too. Just walk up to someone, hack their bank account with just a few short clicks, then collect their money from the nearby ATM. There are no downsides to this, unfortunately. The CPD and Blume don't have any way to track you down, so you get away with it every time.  Now, I might as well list some of the positives. The Chicago Police Department is relentless, and their use of CtOS allows them to track you across the city. For this reason, you must have a fast car. However, if you want a quick getaway, just steal a boat and sail out into the middle of Lake Michigan. You'd think a port city would have police boats, but they don't. The hacking puzzles were fun as well. I wish there were more of them in the game. Finally, there are some parts of the map that provide pretty, scenic views. The campaign missions, despite the shallow story, were pretty fun as well. I especially liked hacking CtOS substations and sneaking out of Cellular Field.  In conclusion, the game was fun, but lacked many things that could have made it worth buying such as a realistic map, the E3 graphics, a better story, multiple save slots, and moddability. While Ubisoft did a good job at implementing unique gameplay elements, they could have done a lot more with it. If I were you, I'd wait for the PC release of GTA V in 2015.",

This game looks like a 7 year old designed the textures while under the influence of heroin.

I'm sure Ubisoft is so over the GTA comparisons but really, it is the best frame of reference especially when attempting to recommend the game. Imagine a near future where everything in your city is linked to a central surveillance system and THEN imagine you're in Chicago--that's Watch_Dogs. Y'know the map in GTA IV? Imagine that city map, except instead of trying to mimic New York, it's Chicago. Now imagine a virtual TON of content littered across that map (that consists of something like  five  six 'islands' or burroughs). But wait, dream yourself into the role of the city's protector, a bonafide 'Batman Vigilante' without the cape and cowl, recall the map, and then you have Watch_Dogs in a nutshell.  Do you lke hacking? Then you'll probably like this game. No, it's not real hacking BUT the hacking consists of little puzzles and non(well, not always)-lethal tactics to use against your enemies. Do you like stealth? Then you'll like this game. I've only played it on normal but I would assume it will only get better as the difficulty increases. In stealth and in all out open combat, the cover system works. That's a big deal. The shooting is wonky cuz third person but... Y'know, that's the price we pay for the immersive, expansive, OCD inducing overall experience. Don't rely on shooting (even in PVP--yes, there is PVP AND it totally works, effortless implementation).  Is there a story? Well, it's a vengeance tale... Aiden Pearce utters the words: 'I need to know WHY', in Act I. Does that sum it up? Because it really should. Have I finished the game? No. What? I don't understand the question. Irrelevant.  So like, it's GTA except you're a gruff, unshaven vigilante fighting a corrupt city with a lot of Big Brother aspirations. You can literally ignore the single player campaign and get lost in this game fighting/stopping crimes and spying on people and investigating weird ♥♥♥♥ and stealing cars and then this guy just straight up executed someone right in front of you and now you're chasing him down... I'm sure the story is servicable but honestly I don't give a rat's ♥♥♥ since I already got my money's worth doing optional side shtuff.  Yeah, there is uPlay. It sucks. Adds nothing. Luckily, also doesn't negatively impact the game either. It launches and then it disappears. I would suggest running the game on 'high' settings, rather than 'ultra', since it stutters SO BADLY otherwise. Car chases are impossible due to the stuttering--bad. If you're running a major rig with SLI or Crossfire, you MIGHT be able to ignore this advice but I've seen stuff in the forums about the game not recognizing those kinds of hardware setups so tweak/demand at your own risk. Currently, I'm running the game smoothly with an AMD HD7950, 1920x1200, borderless window (available from MENU!), and stuff with stuff and anti-aliasing. It runs smooth and looks great--also, the ambient music is great! Yes, there is actual music that will play on the car radio, by real bands, but it's not Vice City good or anything. The actual score of the game is really good though, reminiscent of Mass Effect, in fact.  So think of a sci-fi version of GTA IV and you have Watch_Dogs. Does that idea appeal to you? Maybe?

I know some people are complaining about that but in my personal opinion taking all the parts I love from other games and making a new one is a good thing. Fair warning it is an UBI PC game so that means you have to tweak it to get it running properly. I just added this -windowed -noborder -disablepagefilecheck to my launch options and it is working great.  Edit. Never listen to someone who says they hate an open world game after less than 4 hours of play. So look at those negative reviews with a grain of salt. I NEVER review a sandbox game until I have at least 10+ hours into it, there is too much content to form a real opinion that quickly.",

            "review_text": "Most disappointing game of 2014.  It was announced with quite a bit of hype, and not only that, it was looking pretty great. What you get is not even a slight bit of that.  I see a lot of people claiming about the lack of optimization. Well, that is the least of it's issues.  What you get is a game that lacks basic features that gets pretty dull pretty quick. Pressing Q becomes rather dull, and I am quite sure you do quite a lot more than press a button as a hacker. You have a smartphone that hacks into the ctOS network giving you full power of everything, and all you really use it for is steal from innocent people, eavesdrop on innocent people and put traffict lights on green. It is pretty cool to do all of that, for about 5 minutes, then it becomes such a drag.  Hacking is something exciting and so is privacy, yet Watch_Dogs doesn't portray that all that well. There is fairly limited ability to use for such a big system, and even your smartphone itself has very little use, even though that plays a giant role in it's setting. Everybody can make calls in the world, everybody can make pictures. Why can't I? It would fit incredibly great in Multiplayer.   The game is lacking some fairly basic functions too. Where is melee for example? I have this beautiful stick that I can use in exactly two settings. To catch a criminal, and to sneak up on an enemy. I can't use it on civilians yet I can shoot them all dead if I wanted to. Oh, and shooting them dead, don't expect something fancy there, it's all one shot, one kill. And then the police, I don't really get it's system in general, nor the availability of the police. I have yet to see police actually patrol, which makes sense, but when the ctOS targets me, police are in the region pretty damn quick. Not to mention they can't chase you on water in a world that has quite a bit of water.  half of the gameplay mechanics have been ripped off from other Ubi games. Animations are straight from Assassins Creed IV, and the funky radio towers are straight from Far Cry 3. And when I say half, I truly mean it, there isn't very much more to it.  The game physics are absolutely abysmal, and I'm being nice by saying that. Absolutely horrible. It makes me doubt if they even had a physics crew. You make huge jumps with no speed and destroy everything in your path with ease. Some objects are destructable, and that is just as bad. Search a few glitches on youtube of it, and you'll find enough.  The only good thing I can name is the sound. I truly enjoy the phone calls that you can listen on, they sound incredible. The same goes for emergency calls. They sound incredibly believeble. The human interaction has been voiced incredibly well in this game. Also the sound of collisions are pretty good, there is some actual weight in that. And instead of a broken glass sound, you get an actual sound of metal colliding and deforming. It sounds really, really great.  I guess i at least have the luck of not having to witness the horror stories that were spread before the release, as the release version was more positive than those horror stories led to believe. But as that died down so did the enjoyment in this game. It's not worth 60 euros, not worth 50, 40, 30 or 20. It's an absolute piece of garbage that is carried by it's hype, and I am really regretting my purchase big time.",

The campaign isn't the best, no, but it has it's moments. It's good enough that I don't find myself not wanting to continue the campaign, and occasionally has parts of it that I really, really like. Some parts are tedious though, but like I said, not enough for me to put the game down.  The gameplay itself is pretty much.. there. You're given most of what you can do at the start and you can build up to the bigger things using the skill tree. I'd say I use the hacks in the game pretty regularly, just as the game intended. If you don't you're probably running around like an idiot gunning things down, and that's not how the game is supposed to go. It's stealth, and that's right up my alley.  The multiplayer is definitely a fun aspect of the game. It gives more meaning than 'dudes fighting' like in Call of Duty, because you're either hacking another person, trying to get a file with or without a team, or.. well, I haven't tried the other modes. It's pretty easy to play for me and I haven't encountered a single (literal) hacker, so... Although, my experiences with the multiplayer hacking thing were fun. This one guy tried to hack me but was driving in plain sight, when I saw him he drove off, so I chased him. He drove off a cliff into the water, so to shoot him I jumped out because there was still land for me to fall on. Fell a bit too hard though. Still won cuz I found him.  The sounds. The ♥♥♥♥ing sounds, man. The vehicles are decent, the sounds the player makes (walking, running, climbing, etc.) are decent, animation sequence sounds are decent, UI sounds fit and are decent... but the ♥♥♥♥ing gun sounds. They didn't even take the time to randomize pitch, it's like one ♥♥♥♥ing gunshot sound that replays over and over. Seriously? You didn't record ANY more sounds for each gun? Just shot once and said 'ok, next gun'? Jesus.  The game's good enough for me to say it deserved the $29.99. Although every time I play it my friends are like 'LEL WATCHDAGS,' I'm usually stuck to it for a couple hours each time I play. All it needs is better optimization (not that much of a problem, lags only when driving really fast), and a bit more of what e3 has shown we could do.  Oh yeah, this game does a really good job of allowing players to act normal. You can walk at an actual walking pace and it's not just slowed down like in most FPS games, so it doesn't feel unreal or something. You can turn your car off before you get out if you really wanted to get down to the bones, which I sometimes do if I don't feel like I'm in a hurry.",

Watch_Dogs is a very strategic game, the aim of the missions are not straight forward. Let's say you are in pursuit of a criminal in a car. You can hack traffic lights to cause accidents or blow up pipes underground to takedown or slow down the enemy. This game features a good storyline and superb graphics (of course you will need a good rig for that) You can literally hack anything electronic in the city, including steam pipes, phones and more.  Theres not only the campaign in this game. There are sub-missions. For example, when you hack someone, it collects data from them. So if the guy is being suspicious, you can take them down to save a life. Of course theres more.  The multiplayer in this game is something I've never seen before, if you're playing singleplayer in your own world, anyone can go into your world and look like an NPC and he can try and tail you, collect information and report it to the cops. The best feature in the multiplayer is that you can play Watch Dogs with a friend that doesn't have Watch Dogs, He can download an app in his phone, try and stop you by hacking obstacles while you have to drive to checkpoints.  I feel sorry for AMD users, as this game is really well made and I would really recommend it. If you have an Nvidia card, do not hestitate!",

Nothing groundbreaking in terms of a game here, unfortunately: Hacking traffic lights does nothing for gameplay (cops just blow right through any pileups you have caused), Hacking NPCs to get money is nothing more than a new way to 'take gold from a container' in any other video game, Receving missions via phone was old after GTA: SA. Etc.  I will still clock some hours playing it, as it will be my go-to game for wreaking havoc and chaos when the mood strikes due to the Chicago setting... but still, I'd wait for a cheaper GOTY edition in the future before I would re-waste money on such a familiar type of game.

I understand that people were very disappointed, and I agree that it could have been MUCH better.  Instead what we got was a lot of rehashed Assassin's Creed design elements, and a shallow 'hacking' system that seemed to cycle the same pool of generated data over and over. Ubisoft had a huge chance to make bold, truly innovative, game design but instead gave it the 'good enough' treatment and reduced anything unique in the game into cheap gimmicks.  However, taken at face value, it's still entertaining.  Driving is a bit hard to get used to, and can be wonky at times. Story is pretty cookie cutter, and characters can be kind of bland. Despite all of this, I'm still going to recommend it. There is a TON of content released with the game. While it's true you can zerg through the main story line in probably 6+ hours, there is plenty of fun minigames, and side missions.  And as far as graphics go, you can find some nice mods out there that brings it almost up to the E3 level we were originally shown.  Get it on a super cheap sale.  7/10",

Eventually we got into the game only to find the graphical settings all messed up and horrible framerates. Many members of the community banded together to fix these problems but the random crashes is what killed this game for most people. I soldiered on for another month I only got the ocassional crash, I completed the game and was almost done with the side missions when an update wiped out peoples saves. That was the last straw. Luckily Assassin's Creed Unity came out so I had another headache to deal with.  After a year of waiting for all the patches and DLC to roll out and bugs to be fixed I can honestly say I really enjoyed this game. The storyline was great, I personally loved the vigilante portion and if you feel so inclined you can go on the classic GTA style kill all the cops and have a car chase. I would highly recommend this game to anyone. The audio logs and other collectables are worth listening to, Multiplayer which is still highly active is like a GTA Multiplayer experience and it is incredibly fun. Even the time killing mini games are fun. Piloting a Mechanized Spider Tank and you destroy the city in a Digital Trip or even playing the cup game or some chess there is a lot to see and do in Chicago.",

Lack of blood spatter/blood and car damage is almost non existent. Not had these sorts of issues since the release of BF4. Stuttering is significant, which is consistent when driving at high speeds. Tried all sorts of fixes with little help, but with the long delay of the game these sorts of 'fixes' shoudn't even need to be attempted.

It hits on most of the major features of other open world games, but also misses several notable ones like character customization (no, 20 outfits that are mostly the same style but with different colors is not customization). The story it crams down your throat in the campaign and side missions feels like they lost track of what point they may have ever wanted to make and it just comes off as completely cliche and forgettable.  The major feature it has that other open world games do not is 'hacking', which is done well and integrated into nearly everything you do in the game. It is often used for light 'puzzles' which require you to follow the flow of power or find security cameras that can see access terminals to hack, but it also has many uses in combat and car chases which feel fun. You also use it for scanning civilians and criminals, but I think they dropped the ball on how much you use it for any serious investigation. Sometimes you get a tip on a 'crime', which is just you either getting a package with minor items in it, or you chase down a purse snatcher. Mostly just steal money from average citizens, which likely makes you a worse guy that the purse snatchers, and there isn't even that much you need or want to buy.  There is also an online 'invasion' mechanic, but I hated it. You are forced into a timed hide and seek game against another player hiding from you, and you need to find them and kill them before the time runs out. Most of the time, you can't find the other guy and you just feel like an idiot before you're allowed to go back to doing whatever it was you wanted to be doing. It would've been more fun as an opt in thing like the other online competitions.  The graphics are pretty good, but again, nothing revolutionary. The style they went with is pretty realistic, which sometimes makes things look amazing when taken as a whole... and sometimes makes thing look like awful garbage like fields of billboard grass.  I do think it's a decent enough game, I did have fun playing it for 35 hours (completed the main campaign and major sidequests), but it can easily be skipped. I also advise you to skip it if you want to avoid UPlay, as like any other Ubisoft game, it requires you to use it. Get it on sale someday in the future.",

Firstly, even if the game was good, buying it in preparation wouldn't be necessary. The sequel is in a different city with different characters. If there even was any connection, which I doubt, it would be nothing more than a nod to this game through subtle references or easter eggs.  My second point for why you shouldn't buy this game: it  sucks . Watch_Dogs is an unfinished, bland, boring, horrifyingly unoptimized piece of crap. Playing this game feels like playing a pre-alpha. The lighting is atrocious, the physics are terrifying and game-breaking, the controls are blocky and uncomfortable, civilians and civilian cars are nightmarishly inhuman (civilian lips don't move when they talk, the AI of both walking and driving civilians is wonky and laughable, etc.), attention to detail and polish is nonexistent, and so much more.  If you've heard of Watch_Dogs, you've probably heard of the completely inexcusably terrible driving physics. I had too. But I'm a forgiving gamer, I thought I might be able to look past it and appreciate the rest of the game. It wasn't until I bought the game that I realized 50% of the game is driving. Uncomfortable, blocky, loose, developers-must-not-know-what-cars-are driving.  Watch_Dogs is the most extreme example of Ubisoft's horrible business ethic: start making a game, call it good in the Beta phase, pretty up the game ONLY FOR THE TRAILERS, trick fans into preordering, profit, and repeat. And when I say 'most extreme example,' note the word  example . They've done this for every game they've 'developed,' and I use the word lightly.  When it was on sale, I paid $12 for this horrible excuse for a game, and I think $12 is far overpriced. I made sure not to play more than 2 hours in order to fulfill the requirements for a refund, but it really only took me half an hour to witness all the madness I needed to see. I'm so glad I refunded.  Don't preorder Ubisoft games. They aren't developers, they're criminals.",

After that much, this is basically a modernday Assassin's Creed test, that just doesn't have a series title on it.  The vehicle controls are worse than I expected, and include fun things like flying perpendicular to your original path the instant you clip anything, invincible saplings but telephone poles that break away (The things made of 12' diameter logs).  Other than that, the controls and basic gameplay are basically the same as the assasssin's creed series: find mission on and overworld map, find towers to show the map, get gadgets to do different things in and out of combat. The main issue here is that the weapon select wheel is cluncky, and worse, doesn't pause the single player game. Good luck selecting the item/weapon you want quickly enough to not die. There's also the issue of massive mouse acceleration in the menus. If you have the sesitivity set for decent aiming, the mouse moves about 30 times faster in the menues.  Then there's the invasions. These start on by default, stop whatever you're doing with inane ♥♥♥♥, and an 'offline tutorial' requires you to start looking for an invasion of another player's game as a requirement. Luckly you don't have to actual do the invasion, but it's still ♥♥♥♥ that you cannot set them off as part of the options. To be clear, oyu can turn off normal invasions, but as you hack random civilian's phones, you can get a bounty on your head which allows invasions anyway.  The last big issue is Uplay. I havn't had issues with Uplay up until now. Now I'm willing to accept that the company was to cheap to get extra servers for the first week, and has been ddosed. I'm not willing to accept that Uplay cannot connect to the internet, and claims that it's an issue with my connection. I'm guessing that it's a default message, when it really should say: 'cannot connect to the ubisoft servers', if it really is a ddos.  I currently have a support ticket with ubisoft, and if they cannot resolve the Uplay issue I will be seeking a refund.  If you like assassin's creed and a modern setting, you'll probably like this game. Don't buy it if you can't get uplay to work.   EDIT: Almost immediatly after I placed my support ticket, I was able to actually use uplay again. No idea if they got their more servers up, or if people had just stopped playing.",

            "review_text": "First of all don't bother reading all the bad reviews. Most are by people who either could not be bothered to read the minimum spec for this game or don't even own it. Many are from people who have the attention span of an armchair and zero patience.  First things first. You will need to connect through 'uplay' to to play the game. The majority of issues reported by impatient 12 year olds were caused by launch day connection issues, this happens with nearly every game so it is to be expected and to be honest if they waited a few hours the connection became stable as Ubisoft worked on their jammed networks.  Secondly this game requires a card that supports DX11, it is clearly stated in the minimum specs for the game that were posted months before release, if you have a card that only supports 9 or 10 you will NOT be able to play it regardless of how powerfull you PC chipset is! or how much ram you throw at it, end of story. Also the game only runs on 64bit OS's.  Now to the game. I connected almost straightaway to the uplay network with no issues. The game loaded quickly with no graphical issues, my only criticism is a small one and thats the mouse acceleration, obviously this can be sorted in the setup so all those people moaning about the driving mechanics of the game, try looking in the settings before you rage against the developers. Anyway the game looks great and runs smoothly, I expereinced none of the reported micro stutters and or graphical glitches that many have complained about. Again if your drivers are up to date and you meet the specs the game plays fine, I am using an AMD card with 4GB VRAM running the latest beta drivers from AMD and there is no choppy graphics or tearing to be seen. The driving mechanic and gameplay is on par with GTA games but what makes this more fun is the interaction with your surroundings, ie cctv, traffic lights etc etc to aid your getaway while running through the missions. There are tons of little side missions to keep you going alongside the main plot.  There are skill trees for upgrading your hacking abilities as well as lots of little perks and unlocks for completing tasks as you play through the game. I have not experienced the MP aspect of the game so cannot comment on it yet but from what I have seen so far I can honestly say I like what I see.  Again don't be bothered with all the pages of thumbs down, make sure your system is up to the job and up to date on all your drivers and you should have no issues.",

The only things that really needs improvment are the quality of side missions. There's no drive to do side missions, unless you're a completionest.   The game plays really well and the enire concept is enjoyable. I appreciate Aiden's inner monolgue as I continuously compare him to Batman(who's the coolest ever) though Peirce himself can range anywhere from Batman, nearly to the Punisher. All of the mechanics and central story in the game work.   Something I'd like to point out is that most high quality new games, have mechanics and story that most everyone falls in love with, yet are somewhat primitive or unpolished(may even feel a bit incomplete) but nonetheless are still great games that go on to have fully polished sequels. I think, the mistake ubisoft made was giveing it hype... at all.(All it needed was a few trailers so that people knew it exsisted) If it was released the way Assassins Creed was, I think people would have had more poitive reviews. Because of the, clearly very expensive marketing of the game, people wanted something fully polished and brilliant. In my opinion Watch Dogs has brilliant concepts and voice acting. I don't think it's quite primative but I don't think it's quite poished either.   I hope to see a sequel to this because I know what this game could become and it would be better than brilliant. I would recommend this game to anyone but I would also teel them to IGNORE the hype.  BY THE WAY, I cannot fathom the idea of this game being a GTA clone. The concepts set it apart and it plays very differently. Furthermore I played Watchdogs to completion and not GTA5(It got boring).",

Sure, some people may think differently, but personally, I really like the game (so far, having played 2-4 hours).  Why do I like it? The game feels quite alive (about the same as GTA V, for example) if you look at the people on the streets. Some play football alone, some have a beatbox/rap battle with other people... overall, the game feels pretty vibrant.  Graphics-wise the game looks good. Maybe it's not as good-looking as it was firstly thought to be, but it does look good either way. The framerate may sometimes go down, but it's not like that constantly, at least for me. I know that some people are experiencing it worse.  And then to the main point of the game... hacking. It is done well. You don't have to really 'lock on' to the hackable things (such as cameras), but instead you can just simply look at the general direction of the thing you want to hack and you can do it nearly instantly. The Profiler also knows what person you want to see most of the time. Overall it's good.  In-game radio soundtrack feels a bit meh. Of course there are songs that are good, but generally it's not really my favorite radio I have heard. The soundtrack (apart from radio) is alright. No complaints but it doesn't really stand out either. Sounds sound great in my opinion.  Gameplay feels just as good as in GTA-games. Aiden moves realistically, but the cover system feels a bit buggy at times. The controller (yes, I use a controller on PC for it) layout takes time to get used to, but it's alright.

The main character handles like a drunk and you often find yourself clicking a button and having him do something completely opposite of what you wanted him to do. It's unbearably frustrating. The city is okay, but the driving and police chases (which happen just about every mission) are horrible. Whoever's chasing you sticks to you like glue and as they crash, they seem to speed up right behind you, need for speed, 200mph cop style.  I spent 7 bucks on this game and feel ripped off, that's how poorly this game really is.",

It's still good! Hear me out.  It's a well made game, and it's pretty good. Of course, the story and sense of exploration isn't on par with what GTA V gives. Graphics and audio are top notch! I love it. Driving isn't that great, but definitely not the ♥♥♥♥♥iest driving out there. There are a lot of things to do, but it just lacks some kinda feeling of exploration. It's quite irrational on my part, but perhaps I feel that way is because the game is too goal-oriented. Everything's on screen and you'll never wander around aimlessly. Other than that, it's really good and the sense of exploration probably is just a taste of the game's user interface. Afterall, it's a game that is themed around transparency.  Definite buy, in my opinion. It didn't surpassed my expectations since its first teaser footage, but it's still great and different from other games, and you owe it to yourself to check it out!",

I finished the story line in like 24 hours and no i did not play it for 24 hours straight. I think the story was too short and it should have been at least 40 hours. There is very little to do after you finish the story even the online free roam is really boring with no things to do at all. Lets not start about uplay a horrible service by Ubisoft which i think they did just to screw us over. I recommend this game to people who like good stories and dont want to do any thing else. My rating for Watch Dogs is a 6,5/10  And English is not my native language so sorry if i misspelld something.",

The storyline is one of the best one from 100s of games that I've played.It has such a good story that I can't leave the computer,but I've stopped the campaign to play multiplayer. The multiplayer option is awesome,especially the decryption mode.The concept is very good,but they must make some improvements,for example:the sniper rifles are OP,and ou don't want to play when you get killed a lot of times.  Another plus of the game is the hacking.It makes you feel like a magician in the modern world.Obviously you can add some to that,because you ca stop the train with hacking but you can't start it again,so you can run away from the police. The world is really big as well and it has a lot of activities you can do rather than campaign(chess,poker,crime detectionsetc.) The problem is that it gets quite repetitive when I do crime stopping.  It's really good that every single person's profile is randomly made to make the game variate. One minus of this game is that you are vulnerable in the car,you can't shoot.You can just drive and find stuff to hack to get rid of the police or whatever.  In other words,this game has got a lot of good things,but is not perfect.",

Exploreing a new world is part of the fun in an openworld game. If the map is shown to fast it takes away enjoyment of exploring. After playing the game I cant really remember any of the locations names. If someone was to ask me to say the first thing that came to mind if they said 'Riften, Whiterun, or Solitude' I would respond with Skyrim. I explored those cities and did plety there to have it form a memory of it. In Watch_Dogs this exploration was lacking. Once you unlocked a CTOS tower it showed you everything there was to do in that area. Eliminating any need to go find out what was there for myself.

If you are someone who enjoys open world games like GTA then you may enjoy this game.  What killed the game for me was the CONSTANT crashing. Like, I couldn't even play more than one hour at a time without experiencing a crash and that was on good days. Most of the time I could play between 20-30 minutes before the game tells me to go screw myself and closes.  To say I am disappointed is a major understatement, I loved everything about this game and followed it for 2 years. I bought the Deluxe edition and was there at mid-night ready to play the game. After I got in-game the crashing started, it took me three tries to get past the intro cutscene, and playing after that it took me another 7 tries to finish the intro mission. Safe to say that I was beyond annoyed.  To explain, I have a really great PC. I7 Intel Processor @3.7 GHz, 12 GB RAM, HDD of 2TB. The only component that was 'crappy' is my GPU aka Graphics Card: HD Radeon 7570. Now I put the game on minimum settings for graphics and still I crash, My graphics may not be above the recommended specs but it is above the minimum. Which makes me think that the minimum specs aren't actually what they say they are.  So because I have an AMD graphics card it crashes the game (Its A Graphics Card Crash)...I read storys around the internet and its a big feasco on he said, she said. I understand that UBI has something going on with NVidia and thats cool, but if your game won't work with AMD graphics even when above the minimum requirements then just don't release it for AMD machines. I would rather be upset that the game wasn't availible for me than to purchase a 70.00$ title to keep in my library that absolutly doesn't work.  I tested the game out today (September 7, 2014) to see if those 2 patches that were released for Watch Dogs does anything to fix the game but it only made it worse for me. The game doesn't even launch anymore, BEST PURCHASE EVER (Sarcasm)!  Since it is completly broken for me I wanted to write this review for anyone else who is thinking about buying this game:  If you have an Nvidia GPU then I would recommend it because it is a game that does something completely different from any other game out there.  If you have an AMD GPU then stay the hell away from this product and I don't recommend buying this game until it is fixed for AMD piecies and there is a 100% guarantee that the game will work. Trust me you don't want to have a 70.00$ purchase that doesn't launch in your library.  To everyone who read this complete review I congradulate you and thank you for your time. Have a great day!",

            "review_text": "To start things off, I only recommend this game if you like open-world games and you have the system to run it. If you like open world games like GTA, Saint's Row, and the like, you should enjoy this game.  I liked this game, but it plays to my sensibilities. I like stealth, I like being clever and sneaky and I love cyberpunk. Make no mistake, this game is a cyberpunk game wearing a modern day skin. You are a Netrunner, a Slicer, a Decker. You have cybernetic enhancements that let you wirelessly control the world around you. You can slow time down with enhanced reflexes. You're an Edgerunner (or Shadowrunner, if you prefer). The game calls you a 'Fixer', but that's just another synonym. You fight evil corporations, corrupt politicians, and criminal organizations in a quest for revenge. It's so Cyberpunk it almost hurts that there's no chrome or neon in sight.  Would this game have been better as a proper cyberpunk game? Maybe, maybe not. Updating the cyberpunk look to the modern day is hardly a terrible idea, and more people likely played it as a result. That said, let me get to what I liked and didn't like about this game.  Pros: -The city is large, and yet varied. You have the financial districts, the dock area, the industrial zone, the residential suburbs, the inner city slums, and the oddly rural region of Pawnee, all of which give you a lot of variation in where you go and how it looks. Having been to Chicago, I'm pretty sure they scaled the whole thing down, but that's always difficult to tell when you spend most of the game blasting through the streets at 80 MPH. This though, is to be expected, but what is nice is the degree of access you have to buildings, tunnels, and the trains. I'm still waiting on the game that gives me full access to these things, but Watch Dogs has a decent selection at least. -The Hacking is really cool. You can do a lot of fun and creative things with the tools at your disposal, and the other toys you get, like the communications jammer, the blackout hack, and the noisemaker are a lot of fun as well. -Combat works too. You can go quiet or you can go loud, it's your choice, and the result can change the game's experience for you. I found it usually more fun to sneak around, use hacks, and outsmart the AI, but blasting through them can be pretty satisfying as well. -The game is very pretty, especially after downloading the graphics 'patch'. Before that, it was just decent looking, but after, it was marvelous. -Invasions are tremendously fun and a great way to break up the missions. The multiplayer in general is a good amount of fun, but it has some drawbacks. Fortunately, it's more fun than it's not. -The soundtrack has some great songs in it and the ability to set your own playlist, while not that intuitive, let you set up everything rather nicely.  Cons: -Combat + Stealth is perhaps too easy. Silenced weapons and decent stealth techniques result in trivial combat most of the time. Once I got the silenced pistol, never mind the silenced assault rifle and submachine gun, the need to pull off clever tricks in fights was limited to just about never. -Money is not an issue. Early on you may scrape by for cash, but a couple of upgrades into cash hacking and some rich jerks later, and you're rolling in it. I started leaving behind $1,000 prizes at hotspots for other players just because I couldn't spend it on anything more if I wanted to. I stopped hacking people's bank accounts unless the profiler told me they were particularly contemptable individuals. -Clothing is weak. Nearly all of the outfits are just reskins of the main outfit Aiden wears with the coat and the ballcap. Not cool. The best clothing option is the one with the fedora that makes you look like you're out of some Noir story, which fits the theme of the game much more closely. But seriously, there are something like thirty outfits and they're ALL JUST RESKINS. That's unacceptably lazy. Of course, I got all the ones I could because I was looking for excuses to burn money. -Gun Selection is...decent. Honestly though I just didn't care much about some of the guns. Silenced Weapons were so good that basically anything else didn't matter. I mean, sure, if you want to run around and do a GTA styled rampage with the semi-automatic grenade launcher, you can, but your reputation goes down the tubes, and that's about all it's good for. You can't carry enough ammo for the really devestating stuff, and the cops never call the national guard on you or anything, so the need for the heavier hardware is limited. -The story is, at best, decent. You will find no grand revelations here, just the usual 'Man has been done wrong, gets revenge by doing more wrong.' Even if you max out your vigilante meter, there is a shockingly good case for you being the bad guy here. Also, it's predictable and boring at parts, and the few times it appears to give you a moral choice ultimately don't matter until the very end of the game. -Lack of feeling like you control the narrative. This is about player agency, and I know, big deal, the story is linear, and they don't really hide this. From mission one, you are given a cutscene that puts you in control of the character, but you really have no control. If you don't do the thing you're supposed to do, the game doesn't progress. This happens multiple times throughout the game, where I am not given a choice in what to do, but at the end of the game, I finally get a choice. Maybe that's a grand statement about something in the narrative, but I couldn't help feel cheated that moments like that didn't help define the game. -Music selection is limited and there are a good number of songs that aren't that great. That's personal preference, but what do you want? -People cheat online and there's no in-game way to report them, even through Uplay. You have to remember the cheater's name and make a ticket submission through ubisoft's support. Weak. It's really bad when people have aimbots and invulnerability cheats on for singleplayer that then get transferred to multiplayer. -Every collectable and side mission is basically skippable. Most are fun, and they're all marked on the map and relatively easy to collect, but it is always somewhat annoying when you go through the trouble of picking up all the audio logs in the game and then do the story and are surprised by things you already know. -Game needs a fan-made graphics patch to turn on features disabled for reasons knowable only to the developers at Ubi, though I can guess. Either way, it was a bad idea and I'm going to dock them for it.  Conclusion: There's a lot I'm critical of here, and probably some points that I missed, but all that said, it is a fun game. It's just difficult to put points like 'It's like GTA but pretty and with hacking and gunplay and invasions' without just sounding tired. Like I said, it's a GTA styled game and if you like those you'll probably like this one, go play it. If you like the idea of cyberpunk no matter the window dressings, get this game, you'll probably enjoy the hell out of it. If you do not like open world action games or cyberpunk, skip it. There's really nothing here for you.",

(havent played with T-Bone yet but cant find a way  to play with him.....).  all in one that game is pretty much fun and brings some new view to the open world games.  like skyrim with its economy system and npcs adding life to the world so does watchdogs npcs a great job! the multiplayer is fun and it is possible to spend countless of time in there.",

            "review_text": "I'm pretty sure that none of the people who like the game are writing reviews and that's what's going on. The people who aren't happy probably feel particularly motivated to speak out because 1) it was hyped so much, 2) the delay tends to make people feel like they better have made the game better than perfect with those 6 extra months, and 3) a lot of the problems are technical so you literally have nothing else to do but write a bad review while you wait for a patch.  I've only played for a couple hours but this is definitely the exact game I expected, and I think my expectations were pretty high. All the capabilities I expected to have are here - it's basically like GTA with a form of magic. There's also other stuff I really appreciate like the ability to turn off your car and duck to hide, and the numerous different forms of multiplayer. Even the mini-games are better than one would expect - that's not chess you're seeing in the screenshots, it's chess-based puzzles, which are really fun and feel a lot less silly than playing a game in a game that you could just be playing somewhere else.  The only downside that I've encountered (since I've gotten lucky with the hardware problems) is the uPlay connection, and even that, I gotta say, has been very minor for me. I had to hit the logon button four times the first time I played. Then it worked, and has worked fine ever since. Multiplayer is dodgy, but it does work - I've never been able to find a game while searching for one but I've been successfully invaded to completion (I loved it) and my friend has done the iPad vs. mode with me (we lost connection before it ended, which did suck, but it was really fun for both of us while it lasted). There's another important point: the stuttering during the driving is not a graphical/hardware problem, it's the uPlay connection being unable to keep up with your character's speed. This is good news to my ears because it means that once the network adapts in a few days or Ubisoft shells out for more servers or whatever, it'll go away. If you really can't stand it (I don't think it's game-breaking, myself), just play in offline mode. You can do that, you know! It's not Diablo 3.  Bottom line: I can't imagine implementing the hacking powers better, and overall, it's the best free-roam game I've ever played. Yes, better than Red Dead Redemption (the gunplay isn't as good but that practically goes without saying). I'm really glad I didn't get scared off by this torrent of bad player reviews. The professional critics' reviews are actually more accurate on this one.",

It electrifies you with the tumultuous sneaking/gun blazing/hacker's playground play style with a nearly polished finish. The story is well thought out, but all in all lacks real imagination, emulating The Punisher, or the better known Max Payne franchise and the game has a constant feel of an Assassins Creed air. Watch_Dogs is so close to these it's difficult not to see the similarities. Where Watch_Dogs is lacking is in the poignancy of events(linear play style). This I think comes from the stiff interaction the main character (Pierce) has with the NPCs he teams up with to defeat the antagonists. The problem is not with the characters or their portrayal, but with how Pierce invites them and then simply forgets them. The game tends to rip them away just as the player begins to get a feeling for the NPC. This casts them as if they're an after thought. This especially impacts the game when very interesting characters come along, leaving an unpleasant hole where interaction seems appropriate. At the end we're left with only the main character and the careless city's AI along with the randomly occurring events for activity. The next hang up is with the driving mechanics. They are pretty bad, and it's unfortunate since the game requires a car to get around the expansive city. I've played around 40 hours and completed the main story. I suggest this game, but the amount of hype and chatter this game came packaged with was misplaced.",

I had absolutely no interest in playing this game from what I watched on Youtube, from the formal and informal reviews I read, to all of the promos, to a few of the (hit and miss) vids that I was unimpressed by. Even my friends told me to try it, and would say something about running away from cops, shooting up and blowing up crap, riding around hunting down drug lords in different types of cars you can steal. And I'm like, 'I'm NOT interested in Grand Theft Auto, racing games, hookers, robbing people, or any kind of thug mentality!' The name itself was a complete turn off for me! Until finally the sale price was just right, I understood that I am a Stealthy-Rogue-Hacker, choose my own demeanor in the game, and that 'I create my own kind of gameplay in Watch Dogs!' This game is so much more than ALL OF THAT, really?! You can choose stealth, go in guns a blazing, and/ or everything in between. Different scenerios calls for occasionally differ measures. There are rewards for all types of behavior ingame. You choose what you are going to do. It is YOUR WORLD and OPEN WORLD here! But I would say most importantly, you are a very skilled 'Computer &amp; Network HACKER that will not let anything or anyone stand in your way and/ or threaten the people you love.' You play a modern day Robin Hood in the heart of America, Chicago, from the rough side, thugs side, and poor side of the tracks all the way to the elite, discreet, privilaged executives that run things from the very top of the city back, all the way down to the sewers, literally. You are a one man show but will work with others to get what you want. They cross you and you have a whole host of resources at your very disposal... This game is a trip, quite a ride, and will leave you longing to do all of the things that your character is fully capable of doing. As you skill up, scale up, level up, and put down, you will be begging for more gameplay by the end... This game will have you cussing at the game and your PC on failing certain missions and cheering [*YEAAAAH!!!] when you completely those same missions. The game is replayable, enjoyable, quite a lengthy game, and you get to choose how hard of a game to go for or how easy. And how you play and the choices you make effects the outcome of the game, with every choice you make... I have around 120 hours in on completing the Deluxe Edition, and didn't even nearly get to play all of the side missions that I could have played, and still can continue to play.

There aren't really any side missions to speak of, just side activities that get you bonus points or cash, and after a while they aren't worth doing. The main reason for this is because in Watch Dogs, hacking makes you God.  Generally, the game is quite easy, mainly because of the afore mentioned godlike abilities granted by hacking the environment, but also because most of the weapons and craftable items are entirely unnecessary. I honestly used 2 guns for the entire game: silenced pistol and MP5 for when ♥♥♥♥ got intense. The most useful craftable items are explosives... I think I used a 'lure' maybe 3 times in the whole game.  Its difficult to understand exactly  what  Aiden Pearce is.. Spec Ops? Ex Police? its definitely something like that but he also knows a massive amount about hacking...? It doesn't make sense that he can completely ruin an army of para-military private security types or lethal gangsters..

You can shoot and kill citizens but you can't melee attack them like enemies? Nonsense.  This game has a terrible main character. If you hated Johnny Klebitz from GTA4 Lost and Damned. Well this guy is about 100x less likable. By then end of the game I was just hoping he would die.  Biggest offense is if you use a controller some on the default controls are just plain poorly though out, or more likely diffrent just to be diffrent - which is BS. I gave up on keyboard and mouse the first time I stepped into a vehicle, this game driving is terrible no matter what.  Most of the side missions are relatively lame but there are alot of side missions which is nice (espically if you find types you enjoy).   This game does have some great qualities though. The shooting mechanics are some of the best. The first few hours are hacking devices is really neat...until novelty doesn't balance the other faults.  If it is on sale for a ridiculous deal, buy it. You should get a solid 10+ hours of fun out of it. Otherwise consider waiting for GTA 5 or try Assassins Creed 4 Pirates creed for a better and lively open world experience.",

I expected more from this game - at least for it to run and not crash the moment i start a game or continue a game. For a game at this calibre and price with that much publicity is just a major dissapointment. Ubisoft if you ever create another game, MAKE SURE you run your test properly and not just throw your games away like some half-finished product.

I've seen a few steam reveiews where people are knocking Watch Dogs because of graphical issues, game breaking bugs, useless mechanics and above all else, UPlay. Let me set the damn record straight. 1- I have 1 AMD 7850 graphics card and the game runs fine. You may have to update your drivers, but that's about as much of a hassle as jerkin' off.  No, it doesn't look like a Van Gogh painting, but if graphics are a dealbreaker for you, and Watch Dog's graphics in particular aren't good enough for you, then maybe you should stick your head in a cattle grate. 2- I've been running this game in a hot, sweaty, muggy, closed off room to the point where my motherboard is screaming in agony and the game hasn't so much as dropped in frame rate let alone crashed. Again, if your game crashed or isn't running properly, try updating your drivers.  3- The actual gameplay is the ♥♥♥♥. Once you get over the fact that it's one of those open world games where it's the side missions and stuff that make it an enjoyable open world and not the fact that you can pop random civilians and run away from the cops (even though that's just as great) it makes me want to have Ubisoft's babies. The stealth is incredible, the gunplay is fun, chasing down fools that broke the law like Batman is sweet, figuring out if I want to stop a convoy by driving a car laden with explosives straight at it or if I'd rather just hide behind a dumpster and send a grenade launcher shot at it is what makes Watch Dogs so much fun.  And those people that are telling you the street light mechanics are useless...yeah don't listen to 'em. If you're not a three year old with no arms you'll be able to figure out how to use the street light mechanic to destroy a horde of cops chasing you. But if the idea of sneaking around a parking garage, trying to take out a singular target when you have control over everything with electricity sounds fun to you, or if picking off twelve bad guys and then hiding in your car from the cops in an alleyway only to be spotted by a helicopter you didn't count on that makes you run on a sweet ♥♥♥ car, free-run, motercycle, boat chase across Chicago sounds like a good time, then get Watch Dogs. Because if that doesn't sound fun to you, you need to check yourself into a mental institution. 4- UPlay. Yeah I get it, it's the antichrist.  But if you're really going to let a cumbersome, poorly polished, crappy excuse for a piece of software get in the way of this otherwise perfect game, you're punching yourself in the balls.  And no one likes getting punched in the balls.  So buy Watch Dogs.",

You're trying to have fun so you switch up your weapons/gadgets but the heavy kills you with a long range shotgun before you can fight.  The story has more fallacies than a five year old's lie. Aiden loves to murder people; he has no conscience nor qualms about hurting people if it salves his own sense of accomplishment. He hears the tapes of his would-be assassin and shows no empathy. He plays along with the hacker who betrayed him when there are very many more efficient ways to deal with him. Aiden Pearce's idea of caring is to annihilate everyone who even dares to look at his nephew Jacks. If that isn't a sign of psychosis then I don't know what is.  Gameplay-wise is the biggest flop. The mission parameters often force you to go into heavily guarded areas without killing anyone. Shooting and moving are fairly straightforward, although most firefights are from cover because this man has a glass jaw. That being said, combat is far too complicated and really has no synergy. You can hack, which manipulates objects and overrides cameras for surveillance. You can use gadgets, which mostly cause mayhem and will likely spook your target or alert the enemy who then add more defences. You could use one of your many guns, but then you accidentally shoot your target and fail the mission. Seriously, why are we still pretending that leaving one person alive and fifty people dead makes a difference?  The cars all have speed muzzles.  You'll probably just use Jam Coms, the Grenade Launcher, the Destroyer, the 1911 Silenced, and the ACR exclusively.

I can't say enough about Watch Dogs. I won't say my age but know that I loved my Commodore 64 and even earlier my Colico pong console and have played everything from red storm rising, to wing commander, and every genre since.

GTAV was a omen, terribly written story and catered stricking to their online children with their shark dollars or whatever they are.

It checks all the points when it comes to an Ubisoft Open-World game. A grand conspiracy, some sort of tower/place to unlock to allow further unlocks, and hundreds of worthless crap to unlock that never rewards the amount of time it actually took to unlock... But the main character you are playing is just not a person I like to represent. His whole demeanor is just 'bad'. He feels like a very narcassistic person, a person who in real life I would never assocait with. How can I dig into a game and really feel part of it's universe if I do not like the person I am? The game mechanics are okay, the shooting is about as solid as most open-world multi-role games like this usually are. The driving model is horrible, which is strange considering Ubisoft's racing game experience. People were initially let down with this title because Ubisoft dangled an unrealistic shiny, perfect, photo-realistic carrot in front of us, then switched it out with a carrot that had been sitting out on the counter too long. Looking back at it without those expectations of greatest though, this game looks and plays like hundreds of others post 2012 open world titles. Somewhat resembles the city they take place in? check. Has important landmarks of said location? Check. Real world life-style and social cues from that era? Check? AI feels lifeless and less like an actual city and more like a computer simulation? Check. To sum of it up, this game does what it says on the tin, but it doesn't do anything great nor does it really do anything new outside the 'hacking' component, which any IT person would tell you is nothing like real world hacking. Real world hacking involves hundreds of late-night reading, studying and coding. Not a magic 'hack' button as depicted in this. The story is so full of twists, turns and nameless people that with over 90 hours I still only understand the very basics. Bad guys are trying to get me, I'm trying to find bad guys. Roll Credits. If you want a rating, then comparing to other open world games of this ilk (Grand Theft Auto, Assassin's Creeds, etc) I would rate this a 6 out of 10. COmparing to games in general I would bump it to a 7 out of 10. ",

            "review_text": "Watch_Dogs. Liked/Enjoyed by some; Disliked/Hated by most. This seems to be the general feedback I'm witnessing over time. I guess I'm part of the minority here.  Let me state that:  No, I don't have any AMD products (due to a 5+ year old grudge I have with them). Yes, UPlay is a bummer, despite me having no problems with it (except for a three minute period where I couldn't start the game but whatever-no big deal). And that those are not proper reasons to bash the game so I won't dwindle on them too much. *Also I have yet to touch the multiplayer because that's not what I bought this game for.   I don't hop aboard the 'hype train' for games until they are about to come out (so like a week before or so). This was the case with Watch_Dogs. Heard it was finally coming out, watched every trailer I could find, bought the $70 edition two days prior to release because 'I have money, why the hell not?' Launched it. Played it. Beat the story over two days. Thoroughly liked it. Still hop on every now and then just to walk around stealing bank account information off of nice people and drive recklessly.  Looking back, I suppose the story was a little bland. However, I do believe the developers also intended that all the stuff you do when not on a mission makes a story for itself. For example: I decide to drive across map to activate a ctOS tower. On the way to a parked car, I read into someone's texts about a package location. I take a detour to grab that. While rerouting to my original destination, I see someone get mugged and decide to thoroughly beat the crap out of the mugger. Few blocks down a car accident happens and I see a nicer car stuck in the traffic. Taking it would possibly mean dealing with the cops and_... So on and so on! Make your own story if the main one is supposedly bad. Oblivion had a boring main questline but nobody talks about that. They were off doing their own thing on their own time.  Driving mechanics are fine. They've got a Saints Row feel to them. Saw some comparisons saying they were worse than GTA4's. That's rather opinionated. I liked GTA4's driving mechanics, it just took a while to learn how the car reacts to certain situations...like in real life. Cars in Watch_Dogs have some weight to them and slide a lot, leading to a lot of drifting around corners at high speeds. That I can dig. All that time playing DriverSanFrancisco came in handy.  Gunplay was fine. Cover system was pretty good; hopping from cover to cover was never a problem. I stealthed most missions (if you count shooting everybody in the head with a silenced gun stealth) with minimal trouble. Guns all sound good as well. That was a definite plus for me. I like my guns to have a nice snap, crackle, pop to them.  Hacking was a cool concept. I'm usually god-awful at any form of puzzle and yet the hacking minigame was no problem at all for me. All the hacking in Bioshock2/DeusExHR must've helped. That's at least for the more involved hacks. The general 'Hold Q to make stuff do stuff' was fun. I saw a complaint about how hacking stuff on the road never stops the cops. Perhaps you should keep an eye out for those occasional 'Hey, an enemy car is near this thing, press Q right the hell now' prompts. Steam pipes are very good for those. Don't waste your battery on traffic lights unless it prompts you like that. Heck, driving through a garage with activatable doors is even easier.  Overall I really enjoyed Watch_Dogs. It's a shame not everyone can enjoy it as much as I did whether that be because of unfulfilled self-hype, owning AMD products, or extreme hatred of UPlay. Tis a shame really. I easily rate this as one of my favorite open-world GTA-ish games. If you want some numbers, how does a 9/10 sound? Sounds good to me.   *Also as a side note for those who hate UPlay: Everybody hated Steam when it started. Took Steam roughly ten years to become the beast that it is today. Everyone now loves Steam. Origin and UPlay are still rather young. Give them time and perhaps they will become more tolerable if they are worthy. From what I see, they've got the same ten years that Steam had to get good. Digital distribution services like Steam are a troublesome endeavor.  So now I guess I'll ramble a bit seeing how I already started...  UPlay caused me no issues. I would always have it in offline mode seeing how the whole 'random jabrone hacking into your game to kill you' concept made me think DarkSouls, in which I quickly said 'F that' to. Otherwise, over-the-shoulder multiplayer shooters were/always will be easy to abuse. Peaking over/around walls without making yourself vulnerable is pretty cheap.  My GTX660 was running the game at reasonably high settings. I sacrificed some FPS to make the game look better because that's just me. Generally played with the graphical settings for quite some time to get the perfect combination of running decently smooth and yet lookng pretty good. I've gotten rather used to doing this with more recent releases as my card is getting some age to its name.  A lot of people said this game looks like utter ♥♥♥♥. I beg to differ. The lighting effects are great, the weather effects are phenomenal. Easily some of the best rain I've seen in a game. Models all seem reasonably high-poly. I did spot a few 'way too low-res for this game' textures here and there (cockpit view of the firetruck for example) but they were only noticed because I went out of my way to find them. I also managed to get a car up on a roof where I was clipping through the AC units. I got a laugh out of that. Oh the horrors of the map making process. I've got roughly eight years of experience in mapping so I know a lot of the quirks and have learned to appreciate them. Once again, that's just me.  Another comment was that the city felt lifeless. Hmmm. Parking lots full of cars. Cafes crowded with hipsters on their phones. Those same hipsters noticing it starting to rain and leaving the outdoor seating area. Preachers waving pamphlets on corners. Drunk people hobbling out of alleys. Homeless sleeping in dark corners. Athletic people out jogging. People doing yoga on their balcony. Firetrucks screaming by and people looking at them with a worried look. Randomly occuring traffic accidents (as well as forced ones) and the 'Look at my car!' hustle and bustle afterwards. People getting mugged, beat up, and shot allowing you to intervene. Groups of people jammin' with a boombox. Groups of people freestyle rapping. People reacting to you holding a gun. People reacting to you aiming a gun. People reacting to you firing a gun. People calling the cops on you for multiple reasons. Friends taking group photos. Couples making out in public. People sneezing. People tying their shoes. People dealing with a drunk friend. People doing this. People doing that... ...And you still call it lifeless. Obviously you haven't been looking around.",

Lets get the cons out of the way first. Ubisoft, creator of 'Watch Dogs' have failed us with this service named 'Uplay' It looks like it's just used to annoy us and for little reward purposes. This game should just launch not have a 'Uplay' launcher. Nivida Graphics cards work fine with this game, make it look beautiful actually, but if you have an AMD GPU then your out of luck without the AMD Catalyst it seems. Many glitches and laggy problems with the Multiplayer make the mode bad for some people. But it is also very fun multiplayer minus the glitches.   Next the pros. Watch Dogs looks great many good little feature such as water droplets make this game very dynamic. Hacking is ok. It is too simple though, you press Q to hack everything and Z for the 'Profiler'. The Skills Tree is very big allowing you to build Aiden to how you see fit. You can also buy new outfits for Aiden, but they're all the same style except for new hats and colours. Many weapons keep the game fun, but they're slightly similar. The story is amazing. The story follows protaginist Aiden Pierce on a journey to find the person that sent a man to kill him, but killed his 6 year old daughter instead. Stealth is also a good feature using cameras and distractions to sneak your way around.  Time for the Verdict. Is Watch Dogs as good as a franchise such as the infamous GTA V (Grand Theft Auto Five)? The answer? No. GTA V offers a bigger map and more variety in vehicles. But, would I reccomend Watch Dogs? Yes. It offers alot of fun stealth gameplay along with many weapons and vehicles, but still does not lived up to the hype that it claimed to be. Watch Dogs as of now is 60.00$ and does not look like it's dropping anytime soon.",

        {
            "review_text": "Lets get everyone's favourite sticking point out of the way first; Aiden Pearce is the colour beige in human form. He is a boring, bland, bromidic, brooding bollock of a man. He is not interesting, likable or engaging in any way. He consistently makes the worst choices in any given situation where control is taken away and proclaims to be protecting those he loves while simultaneously going out of his way to put them in danger, ignoring sound advice and even desperate pleas. Of course there's the opposite view, that Aiden is a driven man seeking to right a wrong done to his family in the past, but even that wrong is his fault. It's impossible to hate the villains of the piece when the main character and all his acquaintances are thoroughly unlikeable ♥♥♥♥♥.  So, back to the usual review format then, shall we? First up is gameplay. Short story: It's a cheap GTA clone where you can push buttons from a distance. Long story: the gameplay is solid but repetitive, the controls are slick and simple, responsive and accurate once mouse smoothing is disabled in the config file. One outstanding aspect of the gameplay is how the camera doesn't snap or lag behind turns when driving but instead remains entirely mouse controlled, giving the driving a feel that even GTA and Saints Row games lack. Repetition however rapidly sets in when partaking in side missions, distractions and deluxe edition/DLC missions. There's only a handful of tasks present throughout the campaign; tail this guy, knock this guy out, kill this guy, drive here, play with some cameras, hack this, hack that and that about sums up all of the available tasks. Throughout the campaign you'll end up doing each of these tasks a dozen or more times each and the side missions rapidly become grating when they ask you to keep repeating the filler.  Graphics stand up to modern standards but aren't anything special. The city is believable and pedestrians have enough physical models to not destroy the illusion on busy streets. Cars are plentiful and effects such as blackouts, exploding steam pipes beneath street and actual explosions are all moderately believable and entertaining but fail to be anything special. Perhaps the largest let-down then is the performance of the game when Antialiasing is enabled to a significant degree, even on a top-end gaming machine anything higher than 2x AA brought the engine to its knees with anything but a wall filling the screen and even on lower settings stutters, momentary lock-ups and outright glitches are fairly common. On one mission in particular, about two-thirds of the way into the campaign I found myself driving what appeared to be a crimson tesseract. My car wasn't even red and dibs on the awesome band name.  Speaking of glitches, the physics engine isn't the most cooperative. Occasionally taking a sharp turn at high speed caused my car to enter into a breakdancing competition, spinning so fast it appeared to generate its own pull enough to draw in other vehicles and debris from the surroundings. Other times your flimsy sports car can hit a wall at 100 miles an hour and be barely scratched while slightly nudging a chain link fence in a truck may cause you to explode like the world's most inept car bomber. While driving, any vehicle you take the wheel of also appears to turn into a bulldozer against civilian vehicles but God forbid you actually try to throw your weight around against hostile vehicles, the game expects you to take your licks until the opportunity presents itself to deliver a take down in the form of convenient traffic lights of bollards that you can remotely activate. Neat segway... wooOOoo!  Hacking in Watch Dogs is largely just holding the 'hack' key to remotely activate various objects in the world. There's a decent, if limited selection of things to play with and the small selection enables you to keep track of what everything will do without having to stop and think. However, hacking while driving becomes redundant unless the game gives you a 'Neutralise' opportunity where you mash the hack key in a split second to make someone crash their car. Hacking bollards is pointless since they're always down, garage doors provide a useful way to escape from cops or access vehicles easily but traffic lights and steam vents provide nothing more than a chance to make driving around Chicago more difficult than it has to be. Activating the traffic lights without a neutralise opportunity popping up is akin to a child smashing two Hotwheels cars together, you do it because in your mind there'll be a cool crash but in reality it's a couple of stiff models banging ineffectually into each other like an awkward Transformers sex scene. There's another hacking mechanic where you solve maze-like doodads by rotating stuff to let power or data or whatever the blue ♥♥♥♥ on the white lines represents to get to a goal node but it's simple, unengaging and uninventive.  Sound design is almost as bland as Aiden, with some hacking sequences accompanied by the muted, grating sounds of a tortured dial-up modem. Most of the cars sound like lawnmowers and the bikes are especially vile perpetrators with a top-speed sound akin to a malfunctioning fluorescent light bulb being piped through an amplifier. Guns are equally unimpressive, with generic firing sounds that at once feel very familiar but unplaceable, they're just bland and lacking any kind of well, bang. The final nail in the sound design coffin is more of a personal choice but the musical assortment is full of pop, hip hop and other trashy genres that only serve to irritate rather than engage. Aiden does not seem like the kind of man who would listen to Wu-Tang Clan, or any of the songs on offer for that matter. In the whole soundtrack I found three songs that were to my personal liking and of those three only one was actually something I wanted to hear more than once.  Online functionality has been broken for a good portion of my playthrough but I got into a few contests with other players. The objective was to simply play a game of hacker cat and mouse with the invader finding the hosting player, initiating a hack and then attempting to avoid detection. In the times I was the invader I admit I got a few laughs out of slinking low in my car-seat while the host frantically ran past several times trying to find me and as the host I took quite a bit of satisfaction from finding the invader and gunning them down while they run for their lives. That satisfaction is short lived though, the online modes are limited and barebones and I never wanted to actually seek them out again after taking a couple of shots at each role no matter how much the little pop-up at the side of the screen (wrongly named Online Profiling, it didn't seem to profile me at all, it just ignored that I kept refusing its suggestions) kept pestering me.  Before giving a final verdict I would like to address the deluxe edition's additional missions and their boasts of '20 minutes extra gameplay' etc. Taking 'Signature Shot' as an example sure there's 20 minutes but 18 of them are following a slow-driving car and 2 minutes of them are sneaking up to a box and taking the contents before walking away. There's no shot, no signature and no reason to buy an edition that includes the extra busywork.  Conclusion: Watch Dogs isn't bad. It isn't good. It's just there. All the hype building up to the release may have contributed to the overall letdown but that's no excuse for being boring. To borrow, and twist a popular phrase - Watch Dogs is all filler no killer. The supposedly ultra-cool moments fall flat throughout, characters are unlikable, weapons, driving, missions and sounds are busywork and unengaging. The plot is full of unresolved threads, contrivances that are at odds with the availability of information and vice-versa and people and places most players likely won't care about.  Watch Dogs scores 5 out of 10 shades of brown.",

With TheWorse-mod/patch/whatever I can play with Ultra/high settings and enjoy the driving. The story is corny but enjoyable. Kind of a summer action flick, where you don't care that much about the 'wrongs' in the story, as long as the effects are there and the explosions are big etc.  In the end, I do enjoy it. Just remember to google and use TheWorse patch. Trust me, it really does make a difference!",

Only nuisances I had were with uPlay being a requirement (of course it would be), and the fact that if you try and run things at the maximum possible graphics, after a while, the game will likely stutter like hell. Turning a couple of settings down will likely eliminate stuttering, but it wouldn't surprise me if you still got the occasional stuttering.  Definitely don't expect to be web browsing (*cough* Chrome *cough*) and playing this game at the same time though - it's a RAM hog, and Windows will ♥♥♥♥♥ and whine if you attempt to do so. I would go as far as saying recommending having 12-16 GB of RAM on hand even with stuff closed.

It looks better than I had hoped but it makes no sense. You're dropped into the game properly after an intro with no real understanding of who you are playing. So that part is bearable as you'll learn more as you play however he's a vigilante and for some reason wants to hunt down and kill people. If I knew his reasoning then maybe I'd be more on board with his agenda.  Hacking is so minimal and consists mostly of stealing money from random people or spying on them. This is a big let down as there was potential for so much. An example being that you don't really need guns or need to kill anyone. Of course you have to in order to progress but had the emphasis been more on stealth and hacking; then it would have stood out more.   It's essentially a GTA clone without the humour. Except when you kill someone, either intentionally or by accident, people can &amp; will call the police to hunt you down. The difference here is that you can evade them fairly easily and even craft items to block communications.  There are some wickedly fun minigames involving a giant spider tank and some cyborgs. I've put more time into the minigames than I have the main mission.  In short it lacks its own identity and comparing it with GTA is impossible not to do as the parallels are already there. That's not Watch_Dogs fault but it does nothing to stand out and that says a lot considering it is meant to be about a big time hacker.   Get it on the cheap because it's not really worth full price. However be warned that you need Uplay in order to launch the game and Uplay makes me want to demand a refund so often.",

            "review_text": "How many of us, time and again, have anticipated a game, heard the hype (even if we didn't watch any or at least all of the previews of it) and found ourselves getting it on launch (or close to it)? How many of us have then played it only to be disappointed when the game doesn't meet up with the expectations the hype gave us?  As with so many others, I find myself disappointed with this game. The game is not terrible per se. However it is also far from the amazing experience the hype wanted us to believe it was going to be.  The missions (both side and main) quickly get repetitive. The stealth is similar to Assassin's Creed 'sneak and don't get caught' type missions. There are also limited checkpoints on some missions. So, expect a lot of annoying repetition if you're not good at stealth or just not good at this game's stealth in missions where getting caught is an instant fail.  If you go for combat rather then stealth, well, let's just say the combat isn't all that much fun in my opinion. While there is an upgrade to decrease the damage bullets do to you, even with said upgrade, you can still die pretty quickly.  There are some missions where you need to take out a target (or more then one). There are plenty where as soon as you get close to the target (or final target), said target will flee, often jumping into a car and triggering a car chase. While one might ask 'why not just shoot him?', there are missions where you must do a non-lethal takedown. This leads me to the next point.  Driving is annoying. As odd as it sounds, you cannot shoot while driving. You can however use your hacking to set off traps for pursuers (or people you're pursuing) in the form of traffic lights and other things. Sometimes it works like a charm and you take your targets) down quickly. Other times, it can seem like a nightmare where you simply cannot catch a break.   Enemies drivers are very good at evading and will try to trick you by seeming to be heading to turn one direction only to go in another. They can and will avoid pileups and other cars with precision driving that gets into eye rolling territory at times. Enemy cars that are after you (sometimes they will come in defense of a car you're chasing) are very persistent and will ram you and can overall be very annoying. While it does make sense when you're dealing with highly trained enemies, there are times when more realistic doesn't mean more fun. This however, is a matter of opinion.  Failing using traps to stop pursuers, you can escape just by breaking line of sight and getting out of a wanted type circle. Again, sometimes this goes well, other times, it seems almost impossible.  The various forms of hacking are interesting but they do get repetitive.   One example is being able to hack into one camera and then another from there and another etc. to break into whatever. It's a cool concept. However, it too gets repetitive.  Another example is trying to find ways to unlock doors in order to gain access to an objective. Sometimes it involves using cameras to get line of sight with a box you then hack. Other times, it involves Assassin's Creed style climbing with plenty of both. Again, it's a cool idea but when you're doing it for umpteenth time, it starts getting annoying.  However, it feels like something that I would have gladly done without if they'd instead spent time on making the combat (perhaps give more non-lethal options) better, the missions more varied and the driving controls better.  It's not that the game is terrible. Watch_Dogs is an okay to good game with moments of greatness but also moments of being at times really annoying and/or meh as well as a lot of repetition.  The controls are okay but nothing special. I used a game pad to play. A mouse and keyboard however should be all right.  As with so many other games however, I don't think this game could ever have lived up to the hype.   Everyone's experiences and opinions will naturally vary. Some will love the game, some will despise it, many will be somewhere in between.  If you haven't bought Watch_Dogs, I recommend waiting for a Steam sale or if the option is open to you, first playing it at a friend's house to be sure if this game is for you.  In short, to be honest, my experience with this game is they focused too much on the concept of hacking as a gimmick and built the game around that.  I think that's where Watch_Dogs fails. Instead of worrying about building a world and game around a gimmick, they should have build it around what I think is the most important thing for any game to be: fun.",

Watch_Dogs has an awesome, alive, city to explore and mess around in. Most of the environment is pretty interactible without being too overpowering. Tons of minigames and/or sidequests. The story took me about 13-14 hours to complete alone (without any sidequest). Gunplay was fun, for me at least, manipulating the environment for fights was fun and interesting. The story was a little above average, mostly just a revenge tale. Morality system is a nice little bonus to the game. Multiplayer was interesting. I felt like it was like Dark Souls, in the sense of invading a single player game, but at the same time I enjoyed the whole cat and mouse concept to the multiplayer. I would honestly recommend Watch_Dogs to someone who is looking for a fun open world experience, unless they run AMD (Unless they have fixed it yet?).",

That means that even though you got some decent computer specs, you might not run the game higher than medium for some acceptable gameplay.   The thing that had me stopped playing the game, was that after about 30 hours of campaign gameplay the graphics began to spasm or go really weird. It was kind of like you could slightly see through walls and the ground, especially roads, were lifted to about knee level and they were also fading out a little bit. It was so hard to orientate where I was. (Might sound a little weird, but it's hard to describe).

That being said, probably not worth the full price, but hardly any game is in these days i think.  Now I haven't finished the game yet, so I might update this if i discover anything that will radically change my view on the game  === GOOD STUFF ===  Graphics are great; but -alot- better with 'TheWorse Mod'(weird name i know, but it basicly unlocks the graphics you might've seen in the earlier gameplay trailers, google it, its surprisingly small and pretty easy to install)  Great open world; now I haven't myself been to Chicago where the game takes place, but I've been told that it's pretty accurate and it feels really alive, all the people react to what you do, driving close to the sidewalk or directly at them will make them a little scared and try to get away, among the usual AI responds, you can take the intercity train to places instead of using cars or bikes, you can go down strange alleyways, your phone can scan and profile --ALL-- citizens with no exceptions, get basic information about them, and some of those you can hack and intercept calls or texting, most of the time it's irrelevant, but sometimes it leads to crimes that are about to happen, which you can then intercept with the right timing  Other Gameplay; The combat of the game is fairly simple, you have Pistols, Shotguns, Rifles, Granades and all that ♥♥♥♥, in a toggle-cover format with the cool little extra feature that you can Hack some enemies or objects near them to disrupt or kill them, sometimes you can Hack their explosives so they suddenly have to get rid of them, which they dont manage most of the time without dying, you can hack their radios to disrupt them. The Stealthy approach is also an option, where you can lure the enemies into other positions and take them out of sneak by them, if you start blowing ♥♥♥♥ up with hacking they'll of course become agitated and paranoid at first and later try to search for you as it can't just keep being accidents.  === BAD STUFF ===  The game doesn't run extremely well, you can get a fairly consistant +45 fps on most decent systems, but there is probably always going to be the occasional drop, doesn't happen too often though.  The Campaign does have annoying instant failure states, usually by being discovered during a stealth mission, although most missions allow you to choose how stealthy you wanna be.   Most weapons only serve one function and so far it doesn't seem like you can mod them, however you can carry as many as you like, so basicly you'll probably be changing weapon alot, from silenced pistol, to SMGs and shotguns for close to short distance, to rifle and sniper rifle for medium to long distance and to the occasional grenade luncher if you need to blow crap up.  You can't use weapons while driving, pretty annoying that all you can do to stop a moving car is to wait for them to drive into something you can hack, although it looks cool, it would be pretty nice just to have the option to just shoot them.   ===   Haven't gotten so much into the online mode yet, seems interresting but a little annoying to get invaded while doing stuff, luckily you can disable it.  The story is.. good enough, but fairly generic, so far from what i can tell.  All in all I would give this game an 8/10 maybe 8,5/10, it's a great open world game, but it might not have been -as- amazing as all the hype would have us believe, buy it on a sale, if you're into a mix of Ubisoft's blend of the more usual Assasin's Creed and GTA games",

Or that bad guy who you were expecting to get out of his vehicle and then shoot at you will teleport out of it. Or shoot you through it evne though the vehicle would be 'cover' if you were hiding behind it. On the whole it feels like a crappy console port.  Then there's the story, it's just a hot mess snf goes for intrigue and conspiracy but in the end just ends up getting pointlessly complex. Too many characters are for the most part unlikable and the 'drama' is forced and clearly telegraphed. Entire sections of the story arc felt they could have been cut completely as they are only tangentially related to the main plot.  Mechanics wise: There's an obligatory bullet time ability that was never even touched on it's just something your character does. The gunplay feels clunky, the driving is uninspired. THe online games seem neat although kind of frustratingly random. The games selling point, the abilit to hack and controlt he city seems novel at first and then they promptly run it into the ground. On foot it becomes a matter of what guys can you lure over by things that explode or blow up their own grenades. Be very very careful to not kill the mission critical enemies that your character arbitrarily decides he needs to take down non lethally even though everyone else can be killed without a second thought.  The open world/sandbox portion is arguably the games strongest point, the ability to peek on phone calls, do interesitng collectables and side missions etc.   On the whole I'd say skip this one or at least wait for it to come out on sale.

For the record... i am on a GTX 760 2GB, Intel Core i7 930 @ 2.80GHz (8-core), 14GB of RAM. At the moment in it's terrible state of sloppy optimisation, I run it with a blend of medium to high settings and get a minimum of 45fps. and average of about 55-60 though- depends where you are, what you are doing, and if you are driving a car or not...THE DRIVING IN W_D IS NOT AS BAD A PEOPLE SAY... well maybe because i use an XBOX 360 controller for Windows. Also, keep this in mind: THIS IS STILL A NEW GAME, UBISOFT MONTREAL ARE WORKING HARD TO IRON OUT THE GLITCHES AND ROUGH EDGES, because there are a lot! I have been hyped for Watch_Dogs since the 2012 Trailer.... does this game deliver? The honest answer is... NO. Graphically? This game can look like an old Need for Speed game at best, which is really dissapointing. Story any good? From the frist frame... EVEN THE LOADING SCREEN, i was completely intruiged by, once you ge over the graphics of this... you will have so much more fun. Gameplay? Wow... this game has some of the best fluidity i have ever seen!  This really is one of those games you get lost in... in a good way. That feeling you got when you explored SKYRIM for the first time? remember? well this game will bring out those feelings again.   People are just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off that the graphics got degreaded... but those fools only bought this masterpiece for it's graphics.... or they are with AMD... which they are fixing too! But if you remember why you play games in the first place, you will have a very good time!  Worth the price? Deffinitely. I judge games on how much they can keep my attention span, and this does that very well.   10/10",

The Perfromance and frame rates are terrible, and no matter what level you set your quality to, the graphics still look like baby barf. Sleeping dogs had better facial graphics than this game for god sakes. Other than the cons, It had a fantastic story, fantastic voice acting, and over all a fun experience (Which was ruined here and there by the frame drops).  I would give this game a 9/10 were it not for the terrible optimization of the game. (Police chases were more of a punishment than an enjoyment due to frames dropping down into single digits not just for me but about half a dozen of my PC friends who all have top of the line builds.) But I do have to take it into cosideration so my overall would have to be a 6.5/10.",

            "review_text": "As of this writing I've logged about 130 hours into Watch Dogs. I am currently on my third playthrough, realistic difficulty. Just to give you a general background of my involvement in this game. I've had a very close and keen eye on it since E3 2012. Ironically enough, Ubisoft 'nerfed' the PC version a bit probably to accomdate for cross-gen similarity. Idk, and I really don't care-Watch Dogs is an excellent game, with a few negatives that SERIOUSLY drag it down.   Most of those negatives have to deal with online, which I think is just uneeded and seriously pathetic in that the great bulk of the game's online advertisement is in a game mode that is essentially playing hide and go shoot with another player. I'm talking about invasion of course. You've seen the ads for it-some guy invades your world, initiates a hack, and then waits for you to go crazy while you try to find him with your rocket launcher. Meanwhile, he's on the roof, and there's no where you could have gone to get him.   It's lazy. We can all easily think of 10 game modes to utilize online resources in a much more user friendly community. I mean COME ON! It's a laucnh title, so I would have expected them to at least put some originality into Watch Dogs' multiplayer. There's racing and 8 player free mode. These two kind of make up for it.   And that's my problem with online. Now, on to the Single Player!   Ubisoft has created a large and highly detailed rendition of future cTOS controlled Chicago. It tuly is impressive, even if the landmarks are completely off from their real life conterparts for example. Who really cares? Monumental accuracy is appreciated, but I'm not killing myself over models. Gameplay is my fortay, and Watch Dogs leans pretty nicely int that direction.   You play as Aiden Pearce, aka The Vigilante, aka The Fox (Can you guess why he's called that?), a super sly, super spy badass with a cell phone that can get him pretty much anything he wants. Environmental destruction? Activitating large structures and large explosive obstacles? Absolutely! Need some monay? HACK THAT ♥♥♥♥!!! It really is too simple. So simple that money means literally nothing after about five hours into the game. Was this a lazy element by Ubisoft or did they want us to truly see how vunerable the cTOS network really was?   Try to remember that according to the game's lore, Aiden is not the only one with control of the cTOS network through his phone. The network is in essence a gigantic local spider web of connections that reach out to traffic lights, cars, phones, weapons, explosives, eletronics, etc. You name it, the cTOS network connects the entirety of Chicago. Because of this, anyone may have their information and money stolen, their vehicles stolen, their credit card information, phone calls, and text messages stolen from them by any other group of people.   This is the vunerability of Chicago. Aiden is a kick ♥♥♥ gun man with an expertise in driving and firearms. On the battle field without his phone, Aiden is unstoppable. With his phone, Aiden is invincible. The city is your playground and its waiting for you to press its buttons. If you appreciate Metropolitan free roams then I advise you take a serious look at this game. It truly is massive in scope and its scale only excites me to what they're going to do with the sequel!   The number of guns is rather impressive, but the sound effects on them aren't as solid or as powerful as previous shooter games. You'd think Ubisoft wouldn't have a problem with this since they kicked so much ♥♥♥ with Far Cry 3?   Oh well. The guns are still an amazing addition and a wonderful compliment to pretty much any gun style you're going for. If you're into running and gunning you'll love Aiden's navigation style. He runs in a ful sprint parkour style on most terrain, never needs to stop to catch a breath. Navigation is pretty much what you'd expect from a compasny who made AC. That's cool, I think it works.   There's a skill tree that goes pretty deep for about 40-50 hours of gameplay +10 to +30 hours with inclusion of mini games.   I'd say its a rather impressive game. Waiting on DLC and sequel!    P.S. Stealth is the name of the game on Realisitic. You have been warned.",

Also you can hack their bank accounts. Run around for a 15 minutes and hack everyone will lead you to more money than you can spend, so that's kind of useless. The best part is the multi player. I spent a whole night of hacking people and getting hacked. It's tons of fun. The races are pretty cool, the online decryption can be a b**** if the other team are half decent. Free roam leaves something to be desired. The story is pretty good but not a nail biter. Online hacking is where it's at.

            "review_text": "Watch_Dogs is a story of a modern-age Chicago city and its surrounding suburbs. Despite the hyper-connectivity of the ctOS network and assurances from the company behind it, Blume industries; crime runs rampant, ctOS systems malfunction and whistleblowers cry foul. This game is focused on a moral system that reacts depending on the actions of the player. Will you be a dangerous fugitive, or hero of the alleyways?  WARNING: Consumers please note that this game contains high levels of violence, nudity, drug use, and extremely foul language. Very little censoring exists in this game, and it adds quite a lot to the atmosphere. If you have read this and still buy the game, you forfeit your right to b*tch about it.  NOTE: A large collection of people who have bought this game have had complaints of a 'Stuttering' problem when it comes to playing the game. I too had this problem, but was able to remedy it with some quick googling and assigning the game high priority for the CPU. Because I was able to fix this issue, it had little impact on my experience and will not be included in the Con's section of this review. This note is here to acknowledge the issue and warn future consumers of it.   Pro's:  + Moral system that reacts to the player, and gives the player plenty of choices in the storyline to affect it.  + Realistic and authentic environment and voice acting. Gang wars and serial killer included.  + Randomised environment situations that keeps the player on their toes. Eg. Street muggings, car crashes, murders, arsonists, etc.  + Missions are fun and interesting, they range from intellectual challenges that have you trying to unlock various doors, to infiltrating a gang hideout, to hacking ctOS networks, to racing around the streets (avoiding or plowing through pedestrians, depending on how you play).  + Strong storywriting has the player experiencing the lives of those around them. Allowing the player to immerse themselves into the game and truly connect to the people they interact with. The ending of this game (no spoilers) is very strong and feels satisfying.   Con's:  - Stopping minor crimes can be a little slow for gaining a reputation as a vigilante. This is likely intentional and isn't really that noticable.  - Aiming at helicopters while they're above you is impossible, therefore cannot be disabled while on foot. This is a very irritating mechanic that you will need to avoid. Usually finding a roof of some kind will be enough to protect yourself from the sniper and hopefully make it lower into your range.  - Money seems almost TOO easy to come by, but this is little impact on the game, as money is used for replenishing consumables and getting cars in a hurry.   Watch_Dogs is one of those games that you have to have a long weekend to play, because once you pick it up, it's hard to put down until completion. Players will be pleased with the dynamic and very authentic environment that tells the player where they are simply by looking around the neighbourhood. With a great variety of missions to undertake and a challenging main storyline, Ubisoft has made a glowing example of how Quest/Mission structures should be done from now on. 9/10, and very much hoping for a sequel.",

ABSOLUTELY NOTHING is done by ubisoft or uplay to prevent cheating. It is almost impossible to find a session at any hour of the day in which there aren't players trying to rig the game in their favor using steroid cheats. Worse, they will sometimes turn from semi-discreet (no recoil, no reload, turning their immortality on and off) to completely obnoxious (superman speed, teleportation, unlimited instantaneous explosives and explosives launchers, always immortal) in order to purposefully prevent anyone from playing and ruin people's game and mood until everybody leaves.

The police are annoying, the water looks like crap. I wanted something fun to play but it really wasn't that great, you do the same stuff over and over.

She even sends you a video of herself doing unspeakable things, so you're sold. Unfortunately, she's out of town, so you have to wait a few months until you can actually meet her.

The only bug in general I had was when I set my textures to ultra and half of the peoples faces ended up being jet black. The gun play is about as stiff as a board and you will fight to stay alive in almost every encounter, so at the moment your best option realy is to stealth as far as you can. Besides the bugs and gun play, people have complained about the driving. Yes it does feel arcade-y but after a while you realize it gets its job done. mabye Ubisoft could take about 100 horsepower off all the vehicles because they sound like they have the engine of a Bugatti. Hacking is solid and responsive. Some may say there is no 'challenge' beyond some easy minigames but if the hacking was as hard as Hacking Revolution you wouldnt expect many people to hack in game much less buy it.

I can only imagine that a corporate polling group is responsible for 'Aiden.'  Hitting 'Q' a lot to 'do hacking' on your magic smartphone seems like it would get boring fast and could have been more intricate. Driving is nothing special. The lack of any impressive graphics (I'm running the game on ultra with a gtx 970) detracts from the experience.  The one interesting thing is the ability to affect the city by hacking and read information about every citizen you come across. Maybe the game will get more interesting but unless the story improves drastically I doubt I'll change my review after finishing it.",

            "review_text": "I wanted to like this game, I really did. I went in with an open mind and an open heart and I left 40 hours later severely disappointed. Watch_Dogs has everything I love in a relaxing game: a big open world for getting lost, driving, stealth gameplay, cyberpunk, all sorts of elements. For as big and complex as the game world is, however, Watch_Dogs is incredibly empty.  Watch_Dogs has you controlling Aiden Pearce, master hacker and parkour enthusiast, as he hacks his way through a futuristic security network linking all of Chicago. The game world has, by far, some of the best object modelling and NPC generation I've seen to give the urban environment of Chicago a living, breathing feel. Yards and sidewalks have clutter that changes with the socio-economic level of different parts of town and as Aiden free runs through back yards or across apartment complexes, it's not unlikely you'll trip over barbeque pits or shopping carts reasonably placed in real world settings. NPC's look varied and react differently to your actions and, after a while, the environment does feel sentient.  The fantasy stops there, however, as the graphics, which you've no doubt heard by now, have been so watered down from the E3 demo that they look almost cartoonish. The color palette is off with a base-level shade spectrum you don't see in the real world, and the textures are clean and flat to the point of almost appearing two dimensional. Shading is apparent but thin, debris is minimal, and even in hot and heavy gunfights and car chases, everything just looks so mild. There are a lot of objects being rendered and maybe that's why the textures are so muted, but when Grand Theft Auto 4, 2008, and especially Assassin's Creed, 2007, look better than Watch_Dogs, one wonders why it was released at $65.   The driving, a major part of the game, is just absurd. Almost all of the cars are modeled the same way, poorly. Whether it's a 70's muscle car or Euro exotic, they all have back ends that float away on the corners and send you crashing left and right. I stuck to the same motorcycle throughout the game, wasting some beautiful artwork crafting dozens of useless cars. Collision detection was almost non-existent except for head-on impacts, and body damage on vehicles seemed almost random at times, with odd dents appearing on places where the car was not touched. Very poorly done.  The gameplay mirrors the graphics with a dull story that ignores the surrounding elements of advanced technology, privacy, illegal searches, totalitarianism, and even human trafficking, and settles on a simple but convoluted revenge story. The voice acting is decent but story elements are for naught and some are just stupid, like a main character dying in an odd setting for no reason, and a plot twist at the end that bears no consequences. I'm curious if the people that wrote the plot were even shown the game they were supposed to be following.  The game is divided into several smaller missions that almost play out exactly the same almost every time. The same objectives, the same enemies, it's just tedium after a while. The 'hacking' is non-existent as checking people's phones or activating cameras is done with the Q key automatically. Breaking into a system uses the old water pipe puzzles from Flash games you could play for free on the Internet. PC Gamer reported in 2013 that the developers were utilizing real cybersecurity experts to consult for the game, and I really can't see where their tutelage was utilized. At least the gunfights were fun, which they better be considering you can carry an obscene amount of guns and explosives on your person. The worst of all this, however, was when the objectives were completed and I was given the option to kill all the enemies or leave the area. I walked away almost unchallenged, and I did this repeatedly on the hardest difficulty setting. After doing what I was supposed to do, I just ran from the area with maybe a short car chase or helicopter pursuit, but in the end I truly just left the scene unchallenged. There's a 'bullet time' mode for when the going gets tough called 'Focus'. I made it through the entire game on hard without having to use it once.  Watch_Dogs offers no challenge, not as a game nor as an intellectual topic. I put 40 hours into this game feeling like I had wandered about a beautiful, yet flat, setting for no reason whatsoever. It saddens me because I know the painstaking detail that went into developing the game world, but in the end there's no reason to go back to it after finishing the story. I could go wrap up the massive amount of side quests and secondary objectives but why? If you played one you've experienced all of them. Watch_Dogs is a pointless trip down busy streets, and in the end I felt less of a hacker and more of a digital tourist.",

I would rate this 9/10, it requires you to think quickly upon what 'traps' you will use to dispose of any opponents wether it be lucky Quin and his gang of corrupt misfits or the chicago police department there is always something to take down.  Also there is a good mix of Characters that has a mix of comedy, tragedy and action! Aswell as this side missions such as fixer contracts are fun, and i always enjoyed stealing some cars for targets!  This game is excellent, apart from a few flaws such as the driving being hard to get used to, acceleration and reversing seems to have a kick buff for some reason? and the handling of cars is jolty its like saints row the third's driving, this means AI such as cops can have the upper hand providing you dont flip then over using some back lane bollards, i also believ that the campaign could have been a little longer... at the end you deny a quest to help DedSec, accepting to help them might have made a few more missions. there is also a problem if you drive to fast the textures break and you cant see a thing, i believe they are working on this. However ignore all that crap, this game was un to play a compelling story and it is fun leading cops into unsuspecting traps such as steam pipes, spikes, crossroads and more! it is a real fun game to play and you get drawn in to the campaign so you want to do moreand more!  There is a small problem, its helpful to players but there are no such things as police boats so if you have a 5star wanted level hop in a boat and in a bout a minuite or so your fine!  I would recommend buying this game if your looking for something like GTA but less terrorist and more hacking genius.",

In your mission to avenge her, I killed probably well over 1000 people for you.

PLAYABLIITY - There are many people complaining about optimization with mostly AMD I guess, and I cant say anything about AMD products as I do not use any and never will (NVIDIA and Intel all the way) but anyone having issues with Nvidia cards please just update to the latest driver... thats all that needs to be done. Otherwise the game runs fine for me.  UPLAY - Seriously? this makes or breaks a game for people...? I had no problems with UPLAY and it takes a couple extra minutes of your life.  STORY - Its there and its great from what ive played, you will just have to play to find out :)  GAMEPLAY - This is not an ordinary open world game, the hacking in the game can be really fun, useful and funny at times and besides the story there are so many little things that catch your attention like minigames on your phone and around the area, including digital trips which are some interesting stuff I must say. The only problem I have is the driving is a bit off for my tastes.  FINAL - In all, the game is great... not amazing but great, and people going on about 'Over Hyped' its all about your perception of the game, becasue every trailer you watched... its all there and executed the same way, so it may have been 'Over Hyped' for you but not for me. And anyone saying that its boring might have to actually play the game, because I had a blast just walking around profiling people...  So give it a try, I guarantee you will like it... and im not going to give it a 'Rating' because I look at movies and games as either 'Good' or 'Bad'. ",

The story is good, the side missions are great, and the mini-games are actually very well crafted and enjoyable to play (much to my surprise).

I have experienced no crashes or groundbreaking bugs (no bugs in fact).

My PC at the time of writing this is probably a slightly better than average gaming PC, by no means top end, but close enough that I can run almost any game on just about max settings for everything and maintain at the very least 30fps, except Watch_Dogs. With this hunk of steaming turd the only way I could get it to even run consistently over the low bar of 30fps without the kind of screen tearing I haven't seen since the PS2 days, was to crank the graphics and AA down so far it looks like a game from 10 years ago. Thats a real 'next gen' experience alright.   Even then the controls using a mouse and keyboard felt like trying to run and aim through treacle with no option that I could find to better customise whatever kind of interference was going on with the mouse movements in a way that made a difference. It plays well enough with a controller but if I really wanted to use a controller with it I would have bought it on a console.   After starting the game I tried some of the minigames which consisted of fighting with the controls to complete a crappy assault course and doing the Assassins Creed 'climb the tall thing to be able to see stuff' deal, displaying that this game only had one unique idea in push button to hack... oh wait that exact mechanic was in the new Syndicate 2012 game wasn't it? Well then I guess this game is completely breft of all originality then.   And to top it all off, the game uses Uplay, which as anybody who's used it will know, is a completely unecessary obstruction to playing the game and actually being able to use the steam overlay.

I'm also able to run with ultra reflections which make the wet streets during rain and Aiden's wet clothes look fantastic. Hopefully the stuttering issues will be addressed by a performance patch. I would recommend waiting to play the game until the patch has been released to avoid being frustrated and disappointed by the stuttering issues. Once past these issues, I have been having a lot of fun driving and walking around Chicago as well as playing the missions. The game lets you chose your approach: You can sneak around and even remotely invade an area via the security cameras. You can also go in guns blazing, if you prefer. Or you can mix the two approaches as you see fit.  The Metacritic score is much lower than the game deserves. I suspect it is due to the performance problems at launch.",

To be honest I only saw one single trailer about 6 months ago. Thought it was cool, but I don't follow hypes over games in general. That being said, you'll love this game if go in with zero expectations like I did.   My laptop works just fine: an Asus laptop with an i7 processor and an Nvidia GeForce 745M. I guess others with AMD are getting shafted though. I guess that's a drawback but it's nothing I've experienced here. Only problem I ran into as far as running the game is sometimes it'll get low on memory, however closing others programs remedies this.  As far the car physics go, I haven't had too much trouble. There's many folks who are all saying 'WTF THIS SUCKS, WORSE THAN GTA IV' but I think the developers purposely made the overall feel of the cars nice and diverse. Is it the best? No. However I think it's forgivable. If the controls were really tight, it would defeat the purpose in even having a large selection of vehicles to choose from.  My only gripe would be the music selection. There's a huge amount of rock and punk rock, but it lacks in other areas. That and I wish the game would feature more Chicago's music scene. Lot of good music acts have come from the city and whereas there might be a nice selection of rock, it seems like they just put together a bunch of songs in other genres like an afterthought.  Overall, it's a great game if you go in with no expectations and if you like games with immersion. Great diverse gameplay, and fun multiplayer too.  8.7/10",

From the new idea of a game about hacking in a big city I don't really see how that isn't creative enough for everyone else but for me its pretty damn good. Yes I can say that after a while things can be a bit repetitive but again there are games like GTA that are in somewhat of the same style that are also repetitve that are in turn responded to in a very postivie way.

I would expect a flop from a upcoming company who are trying new things to see if they can generate an interest, but there is no excuse for a well known company like Ubisoft to put out this piece of trash.  The driving is poor and the cops seem to phase to your location with no trouble. The story is dull with the characters making no sense. I.e. Main character being more depressed over the murder of his niece than the mother.  You can disagree and say I need to give it more time, but I shouldn't need an eternity to like a game.  ",

I am able to throw it into ultra and get 30 fps (or 60 at medium settings @768p) The graphics even on medium look great. The game runs fine. The game is fun and its challenging as well. I died multiple times just tryin to do a side mission on NORMAL difficulty. Of course it was 10 on 1. Regardless, the game is great, no problems what so ever and I have been hearing issues with Uplay. BUY IT THROUGH STEAM! The only thing you have to do that involves Uplay is put in a code. And you are never bothered with it again (except just having it run in the background while you play). There is a lot to do and many missions to play. More than 30 main story missions i believe. Each averaging 10-15 minutes with cutscenes that is. Shortest mission ive done was about 7 minutes. There are I believe like... 60 or more side missions with a variety of modes. Not to mention is always to watch people get into a NONPLAYER CAUSED accident and then yell at each other in the middle of the freeway. The multiplayer (that isnt free roam) can be intense and you can get really excited and scared at the same time. Of course I am going off my own experiences and I do not get scared easily. I recommend this game. My only real complaint is it takes a little while to get into a multiplayer match at times. I bought the digital del. No regrets. Good luck with Uplay. And I hope this helped you.  (P.S. if you are constantly crashing like people say, buy a new computer and stop playing on 32bit systems. In the fine print this game needs a 64bit OS to play!)",

The main reason I bought a new video card was because my older one was very outdated. Previously, I owned the GTX 460 SE, now I own the GTX 780. I bought this card mainly for Watch Dogs gameplay. But, was a huge dissapointment. I'm getting freezing and stuttering issues all over the place, making this game completely un-playable.   Also, UPlay? Seriously? I feel like this is part of the problem. Meanwhile, UPlay is trying to be unique and edgy by offering all these 'exclusives' and 'points' trying to make you fall in love with UPlay, but the whole time it's just taking up as much memory as a game like Team Fortress 2 would be, just by running in the background. If it's on Steam, it's already taking up memory. But running on both Steam AND UPlay? Who thought that was a good idea?  Now that all of the bad stuff is out of the way, lets talk about the good stuff. To be honest, it's actually hard for me to rate the game badly, since this game actually seemed very fun. I loved the map design and the ability to help civilians in their time of need. The story seemed pretty good too, but it's kind of hard to play when the game freezes every 5 seconds.  So, in conclusion, this game WOULD be good, but thanks to the lag issues and stuttering problems, it's not good. I do recommend this game, but only after they release the patch that is supposed to fix lag and stuttering issues. So currently, in it's state, I do NOT recommend this game. Honestly, it amazes me that people are even able to run it above 20 FPS.",

Don't give Ubi the satisfaction of 'letting it slide' and maybe next time we'll see a decent game.  For Russian players: Перевод на русский - полный ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ос! Озвучка тоже. Ни черта невозможно понять в некоторых диалогах - такой бессвязный бред.  -------------------- Original review below --------------------  Had my doubts at first. You know, stupid Uplay, strange system requirements, GTA lookalike etc. But after some 24+ full hours in game I can tell you that this one is good. Not something amazingly fresh or mindblowing. It's basically a mix of GTA and Assassin's Creed (and not as boring as either of them). But it is done quite well and is well worth the preorder price. To me that is because I only saw one trailer and didn't expect all the stuff angry kids are ranting about these days. Just saw a game with appealing concept and 'what the hell I'll take it'. Of course if you look at it from the perspective of Ubi's promises it's a damn shame and a failure. Otherwise not a bad game.  P.S. Single language policy for Russia sucks. Shame on you Ubisoft and shame on Steam for supporting this idiotic approach. This is what's going to turn me from buying another Ubigame more likely than Ubi's broken promises.  P.P.S. Uplay does suck really hard. About as hard as GFWL.",

I'm patient, I figured I'd wait it out and trusted Ubi to come out with a patch to solve the horrendous issues on PC. Several attempts to play it since then and it is still crap. The only way I can even launch this thing is on windowed mode with the smallest resolution possible. After that I can change it and max out and/or play with the settings. Heck I've even tried the myriad of fixes recommended across the internet. Around its launch it would simply crash every few minutes. Granted, it does not crash as often now but the stuttering and FPS loss continues to render it unplayable. Months after and buyer STILL BEWARE.  As for the actual story and that ilk, I can't say I can give my opinion on it since the only part I've been able to play were the first few torturous, crash-laden missions.",

The hacking is so incredible, every time you feel like there's nothing you can do but run in guns blazing, you'll spot a little hacking node you didn't notice before and start screwing with the guys as they run around trying to figure out what is going on.  It's fun to mess around with people but the story is also very interesting. Aiden's friends are all really messed up and really awesome. They have sick, twisted senses of humor and it makes them humorous to listen to. I definitely recommend this game to any fan of Grand Theft Auto, Deus Ex Human Revolution, Assassin's Creed or really any open world action game.  The only issue I can bring up is Uplay. It's been down since the game came out and I haven't been able to play online with friends yet. This is very disappointing and I wish Ubisoft would just let us use Steamworks as it actually functions the majority of the time, unlike Uplay. Stop forcing us to use Uplay, it sucks!  Also, I have played this game for about 42 hours and in that time the game has crashed my PC to blue screen at least 7 times. My drivers are all up to date, I turned down the graphical settings, it's a brand new, recently built PC and it still keeps happening. Until they fix it, I've stopped playing the game.

I know is not amazing but for a GC like this one is still nice.  The story is not something that will blow your mind, but is still good, although predictable. The voice acting is good, and they fit the characters well. The music on other hand is a weak point. Not that the music is bad but it's diversity is not even a fraction of a GTA game.  The gameplay is fun, speacially when we use the hacks to take out enemies, although it could had been worked on more. As for the combat, it's not the game's stronghest point, beeing average at best. The driving is not bad after you get used to it, and the cars drive differently depending on the kind of the car, with some being hard to handle, but still way better than the boat-cars of GTA IV.

I don't know what every one was expecting this game to be but its in no way GTA on steroids. You have to come into this game with the right mindset. If you are a fan of Person of Interest I would highly recomend this game. But to the average person no.  The graphics are okay. They pulled a Far Cry 3 on this. Nothing like the E3 demo. But I'm not here really to complain about the GTA Vice City textures ported over to the AssCreed engine.  The game was advertised as everyone and everything is connected. And that you actions will have serious repercussions based on what you do. Not only could I just walk into a gun store and buy an assault rifle right after escaping the cops with no question asked and hang around for 10-15 minutes. Nothing happened as I hacked another 20 bankaccounts during my casual stroll through the Park for the 40th time. I tried not to kill anyone during the game by either using melee or shooting them in the leg. Unfourtionaly no matter where or how you hit them they will die. As I discovered this by shooting an officer in the leg to where it said Officer homicide and knocking another one down with the melee to where it also said office homicide.  On a postive note the enemy AI is pretty advanced. They will give supressing fire while their team mates flank around to the other side. However the saim can't be said for the Allied AI. They will stand around and take bullets thinking they are ♥♥♥♥ing superman. While you are forced to try and protect them from their own poorly coded thinking 'skills.' But by far the worst is the civilian AI. I'm in a massive shootout between several guys and some how a small group of ♥♥♥♥ing civies keeps walking back and fourth between the crossfire avoiding every bullet. And for some reason the people 5 feet away don't get the memo and proceed to walk into the crossfire only freaking out as a bullet or 2 wiz by them. Slowly building up the amount of civilians trapped in the crossfire. Seriously one time there was 15 of them I couldn't get a shot off to save my life. So I just gunned all of them down.  I never really thought of Hacking as something big in this game. Just a gimmick. And while it is really a gimmick it also very useful and funny at times. Remeber when I said the civi AI is out right stupid in the last paragraph. Well when you hack the traffic light to make them all green. All cars will proceed to drive foward or make wide angle turns regardless of what is in front of them. I saw a lone car at a traffic light. I decided to do something nice and change it for him. He proceeded to make a wide angle turn into a wall. Note there were no other cars around. A second time I parked a Dumptruck infront of an intersection. I hacked the light greed and all the cars proceeded to drive stright into said dumptruck despite the fact it haddn't moved at all.  The story while meh at times really make you feel like an action hero. In my case Mr. Reese from POI. But after the story is over there is really nothing to do other than stop petty robberies or play chess. This game needs a level replay function. Something that should be standard in every game. This is a game that honestly need mod support. A reason I keep going back to games like GTAIV instead of something like Sleeping Dogs. With out a big mod community even with all its Multiplayer Features I see this game dieing in a few months (at least on the PC) with only a handful of people comming back to it to get their Batman with guns stopping petty crimes fix.  Also if you have an AMD card. This game runs like a blind paraplegic walking up a flight of stairs if you don't have a Nvidia card. I would also like to note that this game is currently ported (or in the process of being ported) to all the 7th and 6th gen consoles (excluding the Wii) Only the PS3 is using a Nvidia Graphics Chip. The PS4, BXO, 360, Wii U all have GPUs made by AMD. From what I've heard they run perfiectly fine on those AMD based systems. Yet my Overclocked 7970 seems to be having a hard time pulling off High Setting, Medium Textures, AA off. While Nvidia Users with a less than equlivant card seem to pull off Ultra setting with little to no problem. There is perfered optmization, unoptimazation, then there is this ♥♥♥♥.  Unless you really need a Person of Interest type game like me. Avoid this disapointment espically if you are an AMD user. At least for now.",

            "review_text": "Buggy, terrible port that cannot run on max even with up to date software, campaign was too short, repetitive, and the replayibilty is low.   Also money means nothing in this game. The weapons have no variety or customization and I never see any cops on the street. I have seen more firetrucks roaming around than cops. No repurcusion for stealing money from people's phones. You can kill people in broad daylight and the worst that happens is some people run away. Off occasion they call the cops.   Side missions are ok but when doing some they ask you to 'knock down' the target. Why would I knock out the gangster leader if I want to stop his illegal activity? The AI feels awkward when you kill a enemy and his friends find him and just carry on normal without calling for backup. Why can't we move the bodies for better stealth gameplay? Why do the enemies just get a little more alert after seeing dead bodies of their comrads?   Overall it was decent but so many things should have been done to make this game good and unique. It is just GTA with x to hack some stuff and ♥♥♥♥♥ier story/gameplay. Don't buy it unless Ubisoft patches and fixes a bunch of the issues within this game. Annoyed to see AAA companies making sub par titles. This is happening too much and I hope it stops. I want games that live up to what we are shown/told about it.  Multiplayer works fine if you can get it to work but even then it does not offer anything over the top. Yes hacking and tailing are new interesting multiplayer modes but they fall short in keeping you interested for numerous reasons. Why race if you could play an actual racing game? Team Encryption is just a 3rd person shooter and gets extremely boring when the match turns into everyone chasing the one guy with the data in a car, which takes forever to stop if you are able to catch up top them. Free roam is free roam nothing new and nothing great.  Edit: Want to add that clearing CTOS buildings to gain access to certain areas will permentantly despawn the npc there. This makes no sense and for me made it boring since I could not revist those areas if I wanted to fight them or create conflict. Same goes for gang hideouts. Also worth noting that enemy npcs never spawn in the world unless you are in a mission. This makes the game rather boring when you want to hunt down some fixers or gangs and all you can find is civilians. Makes the world seem empty and kills the mood to play.   Shame I enjoyed gang hideout and convoy missions but there are very few and cannot be replayed. If they can I have yet to find out how besides starting a new game.  EDIT#1:  Due to the roguh launch of this game I did not recomend the game. Now that most of the problems have been resolved I suggest trying it if you want a game to occupy yourself with. Still stands that, at least for me, the gameplay and lack of content or variety of content besides the story does not make the game have much replayibilty or playtime once you beat the story. Since the story is not that long or good it makes the game feel empty and unfished. If you want a game though that will keep you entertained for a little then maybe try this game out, maybe.",

Everyone seems to forget that the game is being developed by Ubisoft and they're also forgetting the failures the company always makes. The same games, the same stories. Watch Dogs aims to have a different story with different gameplay. So far, it does that without fail. I honestly don't understand the accusations that Watch Dogs is just 'another Assassin's Creed.'  There are no similarities between Assassin's Creed and Watch Dogs, I can not point out any.   You can't climb buildings. You can't climb higher objects. You can't jump off of a building and lay in a hay stack. You can't execute stealthy moves in the game as easy as you would in Assassin's Creed.  The game is definitely not worth the weight of $60, but it's definitely worth a play.

I have played it for some hours now and have realized this shooting everything is not always the best option. The textures and graphic are really amazing and the AI in this game are not dumb. The best suprise i had was with the driving mechanincs of this game. I had like a billion of crashes initially and took me awhile to master driving in this game, Unlike other games the cars have an initial thrust when accelerated for the first time. Every bump and hits actually affects the control of the car and is something that will take sometime to understand.   But there are some draw backs of this game. The most crucial one is clipping issues. Most of the time when your driving and you bump another car, one can clearly see the clipping issue there. Drop in frame rates. Loading of the map creates lag spikes in game and certail areas have color issues and bloom effects making it impossible to see.  But essentially is a very enjoyable game. And i would definitely recommend this game and also hope devs will in future provide certain patches to deal with the issues ingame.",

Okay so lets get some things out of the way, you are a hacker vigilante by the name of Aidan Pearce. Pearce has basically no personality, but has a thirst for revenge. The entire story takes place in a highly connected Chicago, and involves lots of hacking, the occasional puzzles, lots of driving and more. What this game reminds me of most is likely Mafia 2, just in a modern day metropolis. Now many people are saying that this is a very repetitive. But there are a lot of fun things to do, there is interactive graffitti, digital trips, coffee shops, chess, shooting, hacking, lots and lots of driving, the occasional parkour. As well there are sometimes visual glitches, i.e. light flashing, lag spikes. It boils down to your choice, but I would say at least try the game, if you dont like it you can return it.",

The story is ok, but nothing that makes you want to keep playing mission after mission, but the biggest let down is the 'open world'... it's open, but honestly the game may as well be on rails... there are some very basic repetative side missions that give you a bit of money, but not enough to make them a must, which is good because they are litterally 1 liners done in 5 mins, max! You can earn all the cash you need wandering round hacking peoples phones! There is literally no reason I've found to do anything other than the missions. So you just follow the rails around, ignoring everything else as its just pointless.  It's not a bad game... I got it for a tenner... but it wasn't even worth that IMO. If you want a cheap open world I'd reccomend Sleeping Dogs. Far superior and a great game sadly overlooked.",

You can't wait ten seconds of inconvenience? 99% of people on Steam will just spend hours in the same position regardless, a few seconds is no harm.  Bugs: I still haven't encountered even one crash  Characters: Aiden isn't the most fleshed out character, but there is definitely changes to him throughout the story. Although it could have better character development, he isn't just a cliche character  Driving: I don't see where the complaints come from about this, it is one of the most enjoyable driving experiences I have had in a game. To be fair this is a matter of opinion, but shouldn't define the entire game if you don't like the driving.  Optimization: Oh yeah good idea just buy a game specifically advertized about its high end graphics and then complain when it doesn't run on your budget system that's supposedly 'adequate.' You shouldn't be surprised that this is an intensive game which won't run on your laptop. A GTX 650Ti can run this at about 40fps on minimum settings, and if your card is lower than a 600 series you shouldn't be claiming to have a good gaming PC.  The multiplayer mode is undeniably iffy and is the only review I can agree with. The free roam is simply chaos. However, this game should more than make up for its multiplayer mode, and certainly isn't the first good game to have bad multiplayer.",

The gameplay is somewhat clunky, the car physics and mechanics are simply not there, you will find yourself ice skating your way from quest to quest. And i would even go back as far as to say Driver had better car physics.  The missions feel more like daily quests found within MMO's, drive here, kill this group of people, rinse repeat.   The gun play is OK with the aim assist as low as possible, its still clunky and no where near as good as some of its earlier rival games such as GTA, Sleeping Dogs.  There is no 'REAL' stealth play in this game, on realistic mode i found myself forced to fight groups of enemies simply because they one shot you, at this point it became a cover shooter until i finished the game really.  The hacking is at best a gimmick. generally the tools you have are simply not as useful as throwing a frag or headsahotting everyone with your silenced pistol.  Or if you wanna go loud pull out a shotgun and its pretty much GG.  The police mechanics in this game really confused me, they are nonexistant, until you pull your gun and shoot a bullet, at which point some random npc will call them, they are like ninja detective cops that will find you in the deepest alleyway inside a garage with the door closed, the best way i found to beat them was to drive in circles till they killed eachother or use a steampipe whioch simply insta killes them. By doing this you don't increase your crime level since they killed themselves and no more will come.  The shops are relatively poor in game, i had every outfit, gun, and car by the end of act 2.   And around half way through act 3 i unlocked the last skill .  Skill trees seems nice at first, but the driving one, and crafting one seems a bit pointless. Just feels like they added it to make it feel like you had something to unlock.  I found some missions were far too easy, and offered zero challenge even on realistic. whereas others, instead of adding intuitive mechanics to make it harder they just shove a wave of enemies at you that can one shot you from 300 meters with a shotgun. (this can easily be overcome by the simple sit in corner, pop out of cover and insta kill one then go back down again.)  Overall 4/10 would not recommend and will not be playing again.  Poor quality title, no optimisation, poor physics,mechanics,story etc.",

While most games will let you silently take down a target in close proximity, and Watch Dogs does this too, not many allow you to stand outside of a building, hack security cameras to profile your target, and then laugh manically while you explode them with their own grenade and watch the rest of the enemies flip out because they can’t find you.  The gameplay is fantastically fun and unique, allowing you to hack a large number of combat and stealth devices, giving you the choice to either sneak by, silently take down, or full-out assault a group of enemies, and the game doesn’t penalize you for your choices. You also have a number of thrilling hacks while driving, like exploding steam pipes to take down your pursuers or changing traffic lights to cause mass-accidents. It was very rewarding to unlock new things to hack and new combat skills as I progressed through the game. The story was average (albeit with great voice acting), and the earlier tutorialized missions were too drawn out like most Ubisoft games.  For the most part I decided to stay focused on the main missions rather than most of the fun, but overwhelming, side content. The game itself is plenty long enough to enjoy without even touching the side content, although I recommend at least trying some out because a lot of them are quite fun, like missions where you must destroy a moving target before it reaches a destination by booby trapping the route or chasing the enemy down. There's a lot of something for everyone.  If you're looking for an Open Word game where you can run around and cause mass chaos, you'd be better off with the Grand Theft Auto series or Just Cause 2. There are also some bad stuttering graphical issues that made me restart a checkpoint or two.  P.S. People that complain about the cars -- some cars handle better than others per design (just like GTA), and you need to learn to use the hand break and have a subtle touch to the joystick. Then no issues. The motercycles are nice too.  4/5  TL;DR: FUN combat with your choice of stealth + action; intense car chases; average story; not a ton of sandbox elements in this open world",

This is one of the few games that has been released in recent times to have caught my attention so well and for so long. The only downside of the game is that the mission becomes tedious as you progress through the game. The layout of the mission is different and that is the only thing. If the game featured more different style of mission instead of just using your hacking skills to infiltrate, eliminate all the enemy, and get out before reinforcement comes, this game would be 10/10.

Sadly it didn't live up to the hype it made back 2012. This is very promising game and full with potential to surpass it's competitors like GTA V.   Watch_Dogs is game wanting to be played but it fails to deliver that most of the fans expected in this game. Watch_Dogs focuses more on quantity over quality. Some people are still fooled to what the developers are saying, and I for one is included. I bought the digital_ deluxe edition and the season pass, I felt really embarassed that I bought the deluxe edition because there is really nothing special about it. Same thing goes to the DLC of this game but I have more fun in T-Bone campaign.   The singleplayer is boring and very linear, and I wish they made a better story for a vigilante saving/protecting a city. The only thing that this game stood up, is the multiplayer or should I just say the invasion of another ones game. That game mode is great and it reminds me of dark souls. All in all I will not recommend this if you really want something new to the open world genre. I still have fun, given the hours I spend playing and exploring it.

The game looks great, the interiors are very polished...can't wait to see the city! That's when it goes downhill graphics wise. The first car you get in, it's like you've bought a cheap knock off of the original footage of Watch_Dogs (which, really, you have). The cars are horrid on the graphics side of things. And they all have an annoying screen vibrate and burnout every time you take off. Is this 1997?  Now we get around to the story. You don't feel immersed, you don't feel attached to any character, you can see the deaths coming, and you see how each and everyone fits a cliche. Some of the jokes the hitman (see I can't even remember the names) accomplice makes just make you cringe. Not to mention the lame memes you can hack on to road signs.  Gameplay. This was the only thing I enjoyed. I loved sneaking around gang hideouts, and using the hacking mechanic to my advantage. I enjoyed the charge-in firefighting when intercepting a convoy and the realistic way the citizens reacted. I knew this wasn't GTA going in, so just randomly running over people on the sidewalk actually made you not want to do it after the first time you drove around like a maniac. Unless you wanted your rep to be bad anyway, which I did play with after finishing the campaign.  After the campaign (which is very short at 12 hours give or take) all that's left is the gang hideouts, contracts, convoys, etc. Pretty much like Far Cry 3 but a way shorter campaign. I completed most of it, but didn't really care for the fixer contracts.  At glance, it looks like I wouldn't recommend it. After installing the 'E3 2012 mod' it helped out with the city look, but those buildings at night are just no where near what you expected. The game without the E3 mod looks like GTA IV with iCEhancer...except it's Chicago...and the car graphics are bad.   All in all though, I do recommend the game. Yeah, it's 60 dollars, but I got my money's worth out of it. Graphics/story/longetivity aside, it's a neat take on GTA style sandbox games and it's fun. Maybe they will learn from this and put out a decent sequel with the original graphics they show for it.",

All of the little things that you can encounter in the city by profiling people was fun and I honestly just loved walking around and dealing with things as they came to me. The single player was mediocre because there was very little character development. I honestly couldn't take Aiden too seriously because he was sounding like Batman like 90% of the time, but some of the villains in the game were solidly cool.   When I saw that Chicago was different, I honeslty was not surprised because they kept on showing 'the city' off in trailers so I knew they did something. If Ubisoft would have just made it very close to Chicago and not Chicago-like, I would have enjoyed the game a lot more.   I would give Watch_Dogs an 8/10 because of the solid gameplay and vast amount of activities that can keep you playing and the many memorable moments in the game. The Ditigal Trips were also amazing. Spider Tank is a blast and I sometimes cant stop playing it. What keeps it from a perfect score was mediocre single player campaign and the rather buggy driving physics in the game that can rather silly.   I got it at launch and I am pretty glad that I did.

The game looks great, people are just complaining about its E3 2012 debut look and its not too different so as far as graphics, look and feel go they are what make this game in my opinion. Storyline is lacking and kind of quick you can knock it out in about 3-6 hours depending on how you feel and if you knock out any side missions, but to what alot of people say, yes its very 'Cliche' so if your in the mood for a very action packed hack hack hack everything in sight cause everyone has turned against you and they have crossed the line well, then this is for you.  but to give credit the game is open world and looks great and there are a lot of hacking features, multiplayer modes, side missions and something different from other sanboxes as far as im concerned so if the bad storyline and downgraded graphics are whats keeping you from purchasing this title, well then wait till its on sale cause its worth a buy.  now on the bad end the games driving is clunky as hell, you still need uplay for this title which is annoying and there is not too much physics in the game as far as crashing and such. when you hit things on the sidewalk other then trees they tear almost like paper and your car is not damaged at all. but other then the horrible driving physics and uplay nothing really stands out.

I'm going to start with the cons. The game's world is really nothing special. There are so many other games (AC4 and GTAV) that offer a much better open world sandbox experience. The side missions are super boring after a while, you're probably only going to do them to raise your notoriety level to Vigilante (which barely does anything) or some extra cash (which I never found myself buying anything to be honnest, finished the game without spending money). The online games are fun, but a complete mess on PC (might be different on console). The Uplay servers, in true fassion, will make you wait about 3 minutes to tell you that the lobby is full; unreachable; not even there; oh and you can't invite friends without it messing up. THE HORRIBLE PC PORT. My god, I can't stress this enough, it's annoying as hell. Somtimes it's very smooth and fine, but then it drops the frames like Uplay drops its support. They're working on a patch, but most people are going to be done with the game.  Now time for the good stuff. The hacking. At first I was very disapointed in the hacking, thinking it was missing something, it needed this oompf, but after I played more of the game, I came to the conlcusion I really liked the super simple hacking, that everything is connected at one touch on the screen. The weapon and vehicle variety. I really liked the 'car on demand' app, letting you have a car (outside of missions) whenever you want, with a nice variety of car types. Same goes to weapons, 4 kinds of guns, and it's all you need. Each and every single one of them being fun. The story (this includes the characters). I enjoyed the story, except the odd 'plot' twist ending. I liked the idea of getting with a small gang and hacking the city and its people to conclude a missing link in Pierce's life. The characters were amusing. My favourite has to be Jordi, and then Clara. I liked them for their contribution to the plot and their nice humour. Even if Aiden was kinda of a let down as a character, he wasn't too bad.  To conclude, this game suffers from horrible servers and boring side quests. But to back it up, interesting story and characters and gameplay mechanic. If you like open world games, you might concider buying this after a price drop or after the patch. I give a 7/10",

            "review_text": "It's a nice game, but not really worth it.  Against: 1º First When it comes to open-world games I preferred playing GTA V : in the beginning I thought that the Hacking mechanics would be awesome and game-changing and would make this game better than GTA V in intereactions with the world , but in the end it felt like there weren't as many things as I had hoped when I saw the trailers . The Hacking mechanics felt a little glitchy sometimes ( this opininon can be ignored for the reasons in nº2) , and would sometimes end up having opposite effects to what I initially hoped for. 2º If you really whant to enjoy this game you must have a top notch gaming PC: Part of the reason i felt unninterested is because my PC is not the best gaming PC ever , it's a medium gaming PC , but It lacks RAM memory , while games on average have as their minimum 4 GB ram , that means I get to play (even if it's a little less HD ) but the need that this games has of 6 GB of RAM makes it almost impossible to play at times. I have about 8GB RAM , and a huge part of it (about 3-4 GB is used for secondary processes) and that leaves me with 4-5 GB RAM , and that sucks ,seen as GTA V has amazing graffics and the minimum required is 4 GB it's playable even for people that don't want or can't afford a top notch Gaming PC. In Favor: 1° Hacking : The hacking mechanics althought glitchy and sometimes broken they can , if used correctly , bring life in the game. This brings some humor to the game , wherether looking at a funny conversation about a guy who got the wrong toy model or seeing a Blood donor that has HIV positive , it makes you laugh . and can even give you an edge on combat or in stealth missions. It's an ok machanic but sometimes broken , but when it works , it's awesome. 2º On-line mode: One of my favorite thing about this game is the on-line mode, It's such a good feeling when you invade a friend or a random player and you blend in with the crowd and they never find you while you're hacking them unnoticed. Also the Game-Phone car thing , was really interesting. Sometimes when you are invaded some weird stuff happens , for example I just got in my motorcycle , and as I was starting to accelerate the screen warned me I was being invaded and so I started the engines and started to ride but I accidentaly ran over a pedestrian , turns out the pedestrian was the invader, what a surpries. Conclusion :  In the end the game is fun and interesting , but could have been a lot better made and it was unlucky because it had to live by the shadow GTA V . I recommend it but only if you have a PC that is capable of running it , and you have extra dollars in your pockets , otherwise I fell as other games such as GTAV or Assassin's creed series are a better sugestion  ",

Even though I’m not playing the main story there are plenty things to do as well.

When sneaking through restricted areas there really isnt a penalty to killing anyone so you can shoot everything or go through MGS style.  My only complaints would be that it's a bit too easy getting 5-star weapons early in the game without needing grind bank accounts or side missions, the side missions themselfs not feeling too important and mostly repetitive.

The story so far is partially cliche however it isn't terrible and the missions vary greatly and each are interesting in their own way. Hacking is much easier than Ubisoft originally made out however it's effects are still satisfying. The world is incredibly detailed with side missions and little gems of funny or dramatic moments.  However, up until the eighth hour I had been running with the graphics set on high except motion blur was off (I just hate motion blur) and the game had been running fine, there were no problems with Fps and I had seen very few graphical, or any, glitches at all. However in this past hour where I have tried to boot the game, with the same graphical options, I am met with Fps lag galore and lighting glitches to cobble dogs with.

Ubisoft turned her back on AMD and let Nvidia do all the job, the game is simply unplayable, if you manage to get out of the first loading screen, you are a hero, but don't worry, the game will crash in the next 2 minutes if you're lucky. I've been trying now for a very long time, fiddling around with the settings in the game, I have a pretty decent rig, can run Battlefield, Assassin's Creed and other such games on high settings with nearly no problems at all, now this... this is a whole different story. Frame drops everywhere on low quality, flickering textures, freezing cutscenes, crashes left and right, I've had less crashes with early access games like Rust or DayZ rather than with this game, and even Nvidia users have been having some trouble with this game, so here's the final verdict: Do not, by any means, buy this game if you're an AMD user unless AMD releases a driver update or Ubisoft does so if it manages to get off it's ♥♥♥, do not buy this game if you have a medium to low specs Nvidia computer, only if you have a high end one, and make sure you have no AMD components in it, or get it for the consoles, I'm sure it'll be much better.

I'm lucky, it plays seemlessly and does not lag, freeze, crash or any such system related issue.   My problem for once is uPlay, normally I don't have any trouble and love some of the features uPlay offers. I spend half hour trying to login only to realise I didn't switch my sound back to 2.1 so I have to quit and try logging in all over again. All in all it took me nearly an hour to get ingame.  Now the game itself is so so, graphics get the thumbs up (not running on ultra yet...) but the game itself, typical open world boredom after a while, will they never learn that bigger is not better, bigger is more boring. Give me more things to do and maybe just maybe I may play for more than a few days.  Online system sucks, can't seem to find an oppenent in 80% of attempts so far,and when it does, it appears that I'm not the only one slightly confused at what to actually do.  So do I reccommend this game currently, no, is it worth the hype and the current price, certainly not. Give it a few months to find itself in a sale of some kind, let others moan and groan till the issues are sorted and then maybe it'll be worth £30.

I was getting horrendous FPS on even the lowest settings, however a quick driver update from the fellas at AMD soon sorted out all those problems.  I'm enjoying the game so far, driving could do with a few tweaks as it feels very sluggish, almost like i'm driving a tank. Aiden also moves very slowly in certain situations, for example in your hideout he moves at a snails pace, i know it's a safe zone but it slows down the pace of the game while he crawl about his apartment like he's ♥♥♥♥ himself.   The game still suffers from FPS drops now and then, but it is more than bearable thanks to AMD's recent driver release. So i've changed my review to recommend the game as i'm actually enjoying it now.   However.... UBISOFT!!, please... for the love of god Stop using Uplay... it is the crappiest, unnecessary, annoying, buggiest fragment of nob cheese that i could ever imagine. Having to log into Uplay (when it actually works) is extremely annoying. All other Steam games are pretty much click and play instantly, but Uplay reliant games take a good 5 mins to actually play them, Watch Dogs takes me about 10 minutes because your crappy servers are overloaded and i can't even log in.  Apart from that, i recommend the game. Not quite as good as i thought it was going to be, and it didn't really live up to it's hype, but still a good game.  7/10",

            "review_text": "About two years ago, a game named Sleeping Dogs came out. In that game, you played Wei, an undercover cop operating in deep cover within Hong Kong's Triad underbelly. There were plenty of things for Wei to do (read: optoinal side quest objectives) which spanned the gamut from racing, to gambling to takedowns. You, as Wei, could also cruise around town buying (or stealing) cars, outfits and the like.  Watch_Dogs is almost exactly that game, even down to the name. Instead of a cop, you control Aiden, a hacker and vigilante, meaning that you also are running in the dirty underbelly of the city (Chicago instead of Hong Kong). There are, however, a few things that set it apart from it's spiritual predecessor:  Aiden's phone: This little gem is the source of all of Aiden's hacking powers. With the city linked into Chicago's citywide operating system, the whole game world is Aiden's hacking playground. It can be used for tasks as small as changing the channel on a shopkeeper's radio all the way up to things like turning the power off in a city district. When in Scan Mode, it even lets you scope out detials on NPC's, presumably by raking up data on them from their phones as well as by notes made by the ever present CTOS (network). While knowing that the guy ahead of you is a 34 year old line cook that gives to schools might not sound like much, it goes a long way into making the world seem that much more real and interesting.  Online play: A very short time into the main storyline, you get forced into an 'Online' mode tutorial, which introduces you to the whole concept. Essentially, this pits two players against each other as they race to accomplish individual, competing mission goals. These little contests can crop up just about anywhere at any time, and adds an interesting dynamic flair to the game. Sometimes there's a trigger: a NPC you've hacked places a hit on you which is then offered up to a player. Mostly, however, it's a bit more free form than that. You'll be cruising around town when all of a sudden you notice that someone's hacking you, or you are informed that there's a street race about to happen. All in all, it's another interesting level of immersion that keeps you on your toes.  In the end, Watch_Dogs doesn't feel like it's innovating so much as parroting. Still, it's a fun, engaging title that will hack into your life as you explore what this digital version of Chicago has to offer.",

While it is fun and I am enjoying myself, it is obvious that the developers ported this game over from console to pc with no intent of properly optimizing it. I know this because I have a decent specs and am, aside from crippling lag spikes, able to run the game at a steady and fluid 50fps. The game performace lags to a crawl whenever I try to listen to a song on the radio, and the graphics are not what Ubisoft played them up to be. I would be more than satisfied with the game if Ubisoft had shown it off as is, but I was led to believe I was waiting for a surreal open-world experience like no other. Shame shame Ubisoft.  *This is an edit after the initial review. I'm changing my rating to recommend because after playing more I have realized that all in all this is not a poor quality game, but as I stated before it is not on par with what Ubisoft promised us. Sadly it is a common practice in the game development community, and frankly it is shows that most of them think we are stupid, in my opinion. I would not mind if a game is delayed because they need more time, as I know that they are not rushing the game and intend to make it better. But games like Watch_Dogs that are delayed for months even years and still don't come close to their early gameplay reveals are extremely dissapointing. And I hope that soon Ubisoft and other companies hear the consumer's complaints and change their ways. Aside from those issues, the game is an incredibly fun and unique open-world game, with an engaging storyline and an awesome underground gritty feel to it. If you can live past a few lag spikes that hopefully will be patched soon, and awkward driving physics that feel like you are driving a zamboni machine with jets strapped to it on ice, you will enoy yourself immensly.",

You will get 30 FPS running on Medium even though your computer can handle Ultra.   Secondly, to address the major elephant in the room: Yet again Ubisoft's servers can't handle this game. I think I've only been hack attempted by REAL players (You have two missions where you chase after disguised bots) once, and even then they disconnected within a few seconds.  Now for the major plot points. Aiden Pearce is essentially Bruce Wayne with his mask down, and Batman with it up. The story seems peeled right out of any of the Arkham games. Yes it's an accurate representation of Chicago. Yes it does have multiplayer. Yes it does look nice if you can manage to pump the graphics before you crash.   The point is, it lacks quite a bit, and Ubisoft has done much better. This game is plagued by the open world problem of 'side quests consist of game time so lets make a 10 hour story.' I personally had no real problems with 'Press X to be cool' until you realize most of the free hacks are instant kills in a bubble area. For those of you averse to it, there are cover based shooter mechanics, and the stealth system only turns on automatically, you can't choose to activate it.  Cars handle like you're playing Mario Kart. Essentially with the hacks, it is Mario Kart and the blue shell is the steam pipe.   Plot wise, most characters have sub-par voice acting, and Aiden constantly sounds like he's trying really hard to crap his pants. The only decent voice actor I found was the female hacker, but she falls victim to the sexual tension trope because she's the only female in the game whom Aiden interacts with frequently that isn't related to him. Not once have I been surprised by the plot, it's all predictable and taken from most crime dramas/Batman comics.  Honestly, there's more but I don't really keep track. Point is, save your money. Buy A Cool Story About My Uncle or something.",

            "review_text": "Best way to explain Watch_Dogs is Grand Theft Auto and Assassin's Creed with a pinch of Metal Gear Solid.  But really it doesn't use the best of all 3.  It's a weaker version of GTA with less attention to detail. The Motorcycles, Cars, Music, and Missions are like a watered down but still okay version. It's kinda fun, but there is no life to it. There are far less easter eggs and the side missions are mostly annoying and extremely similar. Part of what made GTA amazing was it's massive attention to detail and freedom to just go out and have fun. Watch_Dogs just pales in comparison to the game that obviously inspired it.  The Parkour and styling of Assassin's is in there all over the place too, but not fully. It's frustrating at times using the cover system, and there is virtually no melee attacks/weapons. It's kinda clunky and doesn't work well. After several hours, you get the hang of it and work with it, instead of it working for you.   MGS but only in spirit. Trying to be stealthy almost always becomes too much work with little reward. With it's futuristic feel with the stealth and technology, it will remind you of the good ol' days with Snake. Sadly though I've given up with being sneaky in the game all the time and only do it to get an advantage over enemies until literally blowing everything up with grenades using machine guns. There are a few 'Stay out of sight' missions, but they are too easy and predictable as well.  What's good? The hacking portions that act as sort of super powers are fun, and the gunfights are fun as well, but I wish I wouldn't have paid $60 for it. There is just too much filler in the story line involving almost identical missions and no sense of urgency. The Story line is really weak as well. Your character Aiden Pierce is too much of a cheesy mysterious tough guy and the plot is really contrived. It's all really predictable. I could write about how the plot is really bad as well, but that would just be the cherry on top.   It's not what it could have been. It could have been gripping, suspenseful, action packed and detailed. But nope. It seems like it can't decide what it wants to be. a Sneaky Espionage game with futuristic powers? A run and gun have fun 3rd person shooter? An Open world sandbox where you can do whatever? how about all 3 but not as good as they could have been separately and for that matter you'll beat it in just 4 days.  Not worth $60",

I had no issues so far besides the fact i have to have Uplay open to run the game each time. So far I've had no stuttering no framerate lag or drops with the most updated Nvidia driver (337.88). For people crashing every so often go ''Offline'' on Uplay before starting the game, as well as turning the Uplay overlay off, that seemed to fix it for a lot of people. Don't use Dxtory with this game it seems to be causeing crash issues as well, though personally i never experienced a single crash.   Overall right now i personally do not reccomend this game, I personally have not experienced many issues and had a smooth overall gameplay experience so far, but i might just be lucky. Right now a lot of other people are having trouble with crashing, stuttering, audio drop outs, and all out failure to run. This may not happen to you, but I'd let a patch come out to fix some of these issues before considering buying this game for pc. Other then that, the controls for keyboard and mouse takes sometime to get use to since they're many different functions and abilites in this game, but they can be rebinded.  I will compare this to GTA V since its the closest match to this game as a competitor. The physics in this game is a bit of a let down, not as good as GTA V In terms of car handling, and damage, with a arcade feel. Though still having It's own unique style which you'll get use to quick and start to enjoy. Not nearly as much envriomental destruction some things you think a car can easily get over like small bumps/barriers/rocks it can't, and goes to a dead stop if hit. The graphical fedelitity is quite appealing to the eye, not as good as the hyped up trailer with It's overdone partical effects, but still pleaseing for graphical enthusiests. Other then that, The GUI is more ment for a console and not so sutible for a keyboard and mouse which does get pretty annoying, they really need more pc optimized friendly GUI instead of holding tab and dragging your mouse eveywhere.  Overall me playing this game I'd reccomend it, since i never had any major issues which stopped me from playing or ruined my gameplay experience. But for right now save your money and buy the game later on after a patch arrives, which fixes these minor/major bugs people have been dealing with and frustrated with.   Edit: Nothing in multiplayer actually works, It's almost impossible to get friends into your private freeroam lobby, with uplay servers being down or the invites not being recived. Hackers already on servers in multiplayer gamemodes. This game would be a lot better with out the Uplay client. Single player is the only good thing in this game for at least PC multiplayer is not worth it. Buy it cheap from somewhere for the single player, but not the multiplayer.  Overall I'd give it a 7/10.",

We already have a game management program thanks to Steam, we dont need another one. That aside, I finally get into the game, I have NEVER, in my years of gaming, had to turn up the sensitivity...let alone max it out. The looking feature is so slow and rough, let alone driving the cars...yeah....trying to spin a slow camera to take a corner in a vehicle that handles like ♥♥♥♥ is no easy task. Beginning missions, its like they want you to play splinter cell style where you are to hide in the shadows and take your time. Ohh wait, if your too slow you will miss the crime and not be able to stop it. Graphics are great in the game, when there is not some weird texture popping up in the middle of nowhere (I checked my drivers and settings, changed multiple things, still happens) Or even better yet, when I am in the middle of a car chase and I get the ever helpful windows error saying I am running out of memory. I look and I am running at 30% of my 16gigs, what the heck is spiking my stats so much? no idea. The menu....ohh yay....Trying to use the menu with a slow / rough mouse sensitivity is so much fun. I have run out of mouse pad so many times trying to get to the far edge. Most of the problems can be patched thankfully and with any luck they will be soon. Until that time however I find that this was a complete waste of my money.  ps: dont believe the 0hrs 0minutes thats another bug that needs to be fixed, I have around 6hours played at this time and I believe i will wait till it is fixed before I continue playing.",

Shallow gameplay - other than hacking, the game has nothing new - it's like a grinning turkey that cost £45.00 just to press a key and auto-hack a target to get their money, whether you want their money or not.

Conspiracy is probably the worst idea for a game I have ever seen, and I bought Ampu-Tea.   Yes I recommend this game, but only by a hair. For shame Ubisoft. For shame.",

Some people say the graphics aren't good and that uplay is annoying but if you've ever been to Chicago it looks to be honest better than Chicago and if having an extra service is make or break for you than you're likely not going to change your opinion based on a review so stop fooling yourself. uplay is insignificant and can be ignored. The hacking is fun, the driving is fun even in extreme lag (ending up in the middle of a bistro trying to use the hide in car feature as cops surround you and you think to yourself 'they don't see you it's fine just keep hiding' is priceless), and while the main character is slightly bland and the story has been done it's equal in quality to any non-groundbreaking network drama (they get high rating than the groundbreaking ones so you as part of the masses might enjoy it).

After your grandfater kidnaps your sister, you embark upon a mighty quest to discover useless trivia about your city's inhabitants using your state of the art Motorola RAZR. But your leek skills dont stop there, 'cause this games a whole different vegtable. With that same nokia home phone, you can become the public servant mr. Watch underscore Dog was born to be; raise bridges to let boats pass, help security staff by monitoring their cameras for them, and even go so far as to burst unstable pipelines (since pipelines run on electricity and require TONS of wires) so thankful construction crews can earn a living. After learning that your blackberry company phone is a prototype, and little more than a gimmick, you can move on to where this game truly shines, the driving! Ubisoft partnered with the creators of 'The Urbz: Sims in the City' to bring the most life-like driving straight to the Gamecube. Go from zero to 60 in .5 seconds and stay that fast, since Ubisoft realised that driving any slower, or faster, or even turning in any direction, is not what people want out of the high octane world of virtual car handling. But enough about Ninten-dogs, back to the engaging story. After you rescue your sister from your aunt by staring at your phone all day, Watch underscore Dogs is free to roam around the bustling city scape at his leisure. And thank god he likes to walk around, (he tried driving, but 60mph was too much) because this Chicago is emptier than a strip club on a Tuesday afternoon (developer note: buying the season pass for $19.99 gives you immediate access to 'Your Pole, My Heart', a dating sim featuring five strippers of questionable health and genitalia). Since Ubisoft saw that games like GTA had an open world, and they sold well, they'd try making an open world Chicago, except instead of putting any form of co-op goofieness or well thought out minigames, they added the ever popualr 'stare down at flip phone: wait for artifical gameplay' to give you a nice break from the main story's 'Stare down at my pay-as-you-go phone'. All in all, Ubisoft once again gave it their best, and produced a game that could only come from the same company that brought you stea- i mean uplay and 'Open Season: The GAME'  I give it 5 phones out 60, buy it today and support upla- i mean Steam!",

How is it that after waiting so long for its release, including pushing back the release date, Ubisoft can STILL manage to screw it up? I wish I knew the answer.  I have not been able to play one single second of this game. I've updated my Nvidia Drivers, disabled certain features inherent to Uplay, checked the integrity of the game cache numerous times...all to no avail. The game crashes on the loading screen every time. Having spent $59.99 hard-earned American dollars on what I though would be a great game, I thought the money would be well-placed. Instead, it went down the drain. Supposedly, they are working to fix the problems, but the fact is this: there shouldn't have been any problems to begin with.

The games built in 'assist' is so counter-intuitive it may as well be aiming at your character. When you turn it down to minimum it appears to be worse. And yet another example of how a silenced .45 becomes utterly useless beyond 20 ft. I didn't even bother with the shotguns after the performance of the pistols in general. 3) The Story....

            "review_text": "I was really looking forward to playing this game and pre-ordered it, which isn't something I do very often anymore. Unfortunately Ubisoft has shoveled out yet another game with no regard to product quality. This is a company I once held faith in to release excellent quality, well designed games, but this isn't the case anymore. FC3 is the only quality product they have released in over two years. AC3 was horribly buggy (the DLC particularly was so riddled with bugs and poor design that it was mostly unplayable), and while I enjoyed Black Flag, it wasn't much better (the free running on ships was so broken that it felt like it hadn't even been tested). While not nearly as broken as AC3, Watch Dogs is still a disappointment. Below are some of the major problems.   - The game regularly crashes (running on a Win7 rig with an intel i5-4440, GeForce GTX 650 Ti 2GB with latest certified drivers, and 8GB RAM), regardless of what video settings are used. - The Driving mechanics are horrible. Overly sensitive steering, even using a 360 controller, and the camera takes far too long to snap back behind the car, making it difficult (and in some cases impossible to see where you are going). Since a significant portion of the game revolves around driving, more care should have been given to the controls to make sure they felt right. As is, driving can be an excersize in frustration. - Broken/useless game mechanics: One example - Players can acqure an ability to disable police/enemy helicopters, and the ability is practically required for escaping police with a high wanted level, but police helicopters hover directly over the character (or car), which prevents you from even using the ability. - Tons and tons of map bugs. - Game settings don't save when set in-game. If you change settings from the pause menu, they will revert back the next time you launch the game (this should be a standard test case for any game that has settings that can be changed during gameplay).  There is much more, I could easily go on all day listing all the bugs I've seen in the game. However, I could fogive many of them if the game didn't crash and all of the core game functionality worked right.   Now, there is a lot that works really well in the game, which is why I keep playing. The hacking mechanics are fun (particularly the offensive/defensive environment hacking during car/foot chases), Combat works well (though, it would be nice if the game paused while accessing the weapon wheel, like most games), the stealth mechanics are relatively smooth and really help this game stand out from all the other open-world games out there. Also, (for the most part) the story Missions are well designed and fun to play (at least the missions that don't involve car chases). With all that said, I really, really want the game to be great, but everytime it crashes, or I have to deal with a driving mission, I just walk away feeling frustrated and disappointed. In it's current state, I would rate it a 4/10. However, if they fixed everything I mentioned above, I would easily give it a 9/10.",

It includes an ability called focus which is used to slow time down. Would be more impressed with it if such a gimmick wasn't as old as dirt by now. Combat AIs aren't bad, but they're not particularly dangerous either.  2)Hacking, basically find something to hack, then hold down q for 1 second. Somtimes involves a little puzzle for more 'secure' systems. Can affect some physical objects, which can be amusing the first time. 10 minutes into the game, it is repetitive and boring, though occasionally useful when paired with the 3rd mechanic.   3)Driving- I probably spend over 3/4 of the game in one car or another. So many of the main quests and side contracts require a car chase, either as the pursuer or the rabbit. Its a little fun at first to drive some of the faster vehicles through traffic, but again, it gets old a bit quick. Traffic is ridiculously light for a major city like chicago. 90% of the time its perfectly safe to blow through intersections without slowing. There are no police on the streets unless a citizen calls them. So literally it becomes set the waypoint on the map and follow the arrows to it at full speed.  Story is so-so. Starts off weak and cliched, gets a little better as it goes on, but still not great.  More points off for having to install Uplay and login to it every time I want to play. I recognize that it's a week after the release of a major title and that the login servers are going to be a bit overburdened, but really? I don't see the point of having to use Uplay in the first place.",

The Bad:  -Main character is boring, and horribly realized. He's genuinely a horrible person with almost no likeable features.   -Supporting cast is all right, but again poorly realized.  -The radio stations/media app were all chosen by what I assume to be a 12 year old emo boy. Music sucks, and there is not enough variety.   -Over all sound design is ok, but nothing special.  -POORLY OPTIMIZED PC GRAPHICS!   -Boring mission design.   -Boring story and writing.   -Complete lack of technical terminology and a lack of interesting hacking applications.   -Side activities often appear as *Not Available* for no apparent reason, and without explanation.   -Driving mechanics are horrible, and incredibly annoying.    So to sum it up I would say if your interested in Watch Dogs wait for it to go down in price. This games is not worth the full price investment. The buy line for me would probably be $19.99 or less.

I spent time searching and using the ctOS system to get around without going in guns blazing... The story line was ok, it had one compared to GTA... Multiplayer is also is a nice change... being able to hack into someone elses game was different and fun, and I didn't feel I was having to choose like Assasins Creed  I have enjoyed this game and hopefully Ubisoft &amp; Nvidia sort out the Graphics issues which will make Chicago look Stunning and I hope you do too",

This game has the same tendency as every Ubisoft game unfortuantly. That being that you're just sic of the game by the time you finish it because while there may be a lot of content, most of the missions in the story involve doing the samething over again just in a different setting, which is what all the side mission are. There is probably no more than a dozen different things to actually do, just you repeat them over and over in 'different' missions. It's still pretty buggy at this point so be prepared for that. The driving is not the greatest which I guess is what they were going for(can't figure out why.) But once you get used to that it's a decent game. Story as most Ubisoft games are was fantasic. I thought the items were too easy to achieve. Money comes by very easily. Bottom line it's like Assassin's Creed, half heartedly mixed with a techno GTA.

The only patch they've released since is a DLC patch for 'new content' (read: pre-order bonuses repackaged as fresh content).

But, the game is still a very enjoyable game, it may not be as good as we expected to be but it is still an amazing game for me at least. The graphics are still quite impressive, and the idea is original. Here are some pros and cons,  PROS: Great Visuals and Graphics Fun to explore the city of Chicago Good AI system Great Storyline Hacking is fun Map Size is Pretty Good  CONS: Driving isn't exactly bad, its just not too realistic, so i'm not sure if this would be a CON, but its not PRO The Hacking Puzzles annoy me, but they aren't hard at all, just feel like a waste of time  I also heard a ton of complaints that the game was terribly optimized, I understand that it may not be as optimized as it could be but I also feel that a lot of people just do not have the graphics card to run this type of graphics, and I bet they couldn't run other visually amazing games like Crysis 3 or Battlefield 4. Not saying this is the case with all of the people complaining (I use Nvidia therefore I cannot speak for the AMD users as I heard it was not as well Optimized for those graphics cards). But I use a Geforce GTX 860M and I run the game on High with 40 FPS or so. The graphics card is not too expensive so I think some people just need to upgrade for certain games instead of blaming the gaming industry for getting better graphics. So overall I rate this game 10/10 to be honest, I know many people do not share this opinion but I personally really enjoyed this game.",

About the gameplay (as far as I could play): Can't tell you about the story as I didn't get past the 2nd mission, yet the hacking possibilities in that stage of the game seem rather simple: Switch traffic lights, open draw bridges, blow up steam pipes, maybe two or three more.

Also, you never see any cops around (even when driving over people and causing general mayhem) until you break any scripted 'laws' which causes them to spawn all of a sudden and swarm all over you.

The story could be from any game. I want to be fighting a maniacal corporation; battling rival hackers. Instead it's an average story that doesn't connect with his life as a hacker, and the writting for what's there is pretty weak, too: For example, one part has you track someone down to a poker game, and you have to slueth out who they are. The game has a fully built poker mini-game, so this could be a really fun moment! Instead, the game never happens, and the guy just runs out for another chase sequene. . Good things in this game are not utilized to their full extent.  The hacking, overall, feels lost: he's stated to be a master hacker, but about the most you'll do with it is to flip traffic lights around and cackle evily. Why doesn't everyone do this? As well, you always have to look at what you're hacking, which just doesn't make sense for hacking computer networks.  I'm frustrated by how slowly computer drivers drive. It's indicitive of how much polish this game still needs: I literally cannot drive slow enough to match pace with other drivers. I like roleplaying, and want to assassinate someone, and then disappear into the crowd, but I can't have that immersion here. Everyone drives so slowly, that I can only go that slow if I let my car idle down and stop. Every other driver is literally driving at the verge of being stopped! It's really frustrating to me. :|  Frankly, the best part of this game is right at the start. You have to evade the police who are searching the streets, but they don't know where exactly you are. That part was great: watching where cop cars are going, and slipping around behind them. . Any other time, the enemy has homing on your location, and goes directly to you. You have to just out drive them--essentially--and once you have, they're all out of your range, so it's not like they're milling about on the street for you to evade; maybe one car, but that's it. I see glimmers of designs I like in this game, but I have to think 'maybe a future game will do this better.'  That's what I think about this game. Maybe the second one will be better; it certainly could be. Ideas like the virtual trips are fun here, but the lame story, annoying controls--which I didn't discuss in depth here, but they are quite bad--and the unpolished face of this game really hamper the good moments in here.",

But for the game itself: I enjoy playing it thus far, I like the story, I like the hacking opportunities you have and the love for the detail. Civilians aren't strolling around with one animation, aren't always doing the same and have their stories, sometimes you see them sneeze for example, there you can find a beggar under a bridge, over there a worker at a building site phoning with his wife, telling her what he'd like to do with her next night etc. You can rescue civilians from criminals, thus increasing your reputation with them, which leads them to not calling the police when they see you or atleast doing it only rarely. This works the other way round though, if you walk through the city massacring civilians, they're going to hate you with all the proper consequences ;) The peak of this is, that certain civilians, I don't wanna spoil here too much, react, when you hack their phone and call Blume, the company that is responsible for ctOS, thus increasing your bounty, if you don't stop them from calling Blume.  That leads me to the next part, the multiplayer. It is set in the living world, the streets aren't empty or something like that, it is integrated into the world. As said, some civilians set a bounty on your head for hacking your phone, which makes you a more attractive target for other players, who want to hack your phone or want to tail you, so you got to put a stop to them by finding them and killing them. But this isn't all, there's also the classical Team Deathmatch mode or a Race mode for NFS-Fans and a Free Roam Mode, I haven't tried out yet, I assume, it's some sort of Co-Op-Play but can't guarantee, that this assumption is correct. Also there is the 'ctOS Mobile Challenge', that is linked to a smartphone app. The smartphone player controls the police and another player in the game itself has to escape the police units and drive through checkpoints. So all in all, there is a bit of everything for everyone and It's well made.  Now for technical things: You can use an Xbox-Controller, if you like, don't have one and won't use one. Graphics are amazing even on low settings, I would compare it to GTA 4 even on Low, got no stuttering or anything else on Low, my computer can't take more but if it alrdy looks very good on low, Imagine what it looks like on Ultra, if your PC can handle it. Sound is nice, I don't think, that it has a low quality. The Music you can listen too, well, don't expect too many prominent stars there, Alice Cooper has one track in it but besides that I didn't recognize anyone so don't expect a musical repertoire like in the GTA-Games, Watchdogs is on the loosing side here. The Handling of the Vehicles, well, on Keyboard it is a little edgy, not that smooth as it could be, in comparison to GTA the GTA games do it clearly better. I heard, that you can handle cars more smooth on a controller but since I don't own one, I can't confirm or deny that. A huge downside I experienced is a random crash happening, when Firefox is opened in the background, I don't know if this has to do with my system or the game but I assume the later, since I didn't experience anything similar in other games.  Now for the Price: I bought the game during the sale for -50% off, the digital deluxe edition + Season pass, totalling all in all at around 44€. The standard edition all alone, without any dlc's or digital deluxe content would've cost 29,99€.  To be honest, I'm a little stingy and a university student, I can't afford much for games and wouldn't have bought the game for the full 60€ before the sale.  It is clearly worth the 44€ I payed for the full package, I don't regret that and the game offers many features more, I didn't mention in detail, for example funny minigames , side mission and such stuff. Is it worth the full 60€ or even around 80€ as full package outside the sale? For me no, since I can't afford that but that is my personal opinion. I recommend, if you can afford it even for the full price, that you first try the 60€ version or get it on ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (Steam censored it in the original spelling) or whereever at a discount price and decide afterwards, if you like it that much, that you wan't to buy the DLC's, I recommend the Season Pass here, since even outside the sale, you safe a little money here, because the Season Pass consists out of the three DLC's for a lesser total price than if you buy them seperately.  But all in all, it's a good game, I recommend it and In my personal, honest opinion, most of the bad reviews and forum posts on the community hub are exaggerated or troll posts, don't listen to them that much.",

If you have a hacker side to you then you'll like this game, almost no matter what. The side missions are fun, but should have been more in depth. In this game you'll be given a specific amount of missions that require very little brain work, and more just time and perserverence, and that's kidna the way the plot leaves you. The plot is realistic yet so far fetched at some points. This game really is full of wants and desires, mixed with annoyence. The multiplayer is joke, absolutely terrible. The multiplayer hacking is fun but not diverse enough, there are only a few game modes, like following/tailing, intrusion, racing. All in all its a fun game, but compared to the possibilty of what it could have been, it'll just let you down.

I bought this game when it was on sale, and I have to say that I got what I payed for. A fairly good storyline, some pretty intense online battles, and a open word sandbox for me to play in. However, having played games such as GTA 4 and GTA 5, I expected so much out of it. I expected this game to trump all of those games in one fell swoop. This is not that game, though. The contols for this game isn't so great on the computer mouse and keyboard, so don't even try. Just play the game on a controller to save all that fuss. But other than that, it's a faily enjoyable game. If this game is still on sale, you have a controller laying around (either ps3-4 or xbox), and the idea of hacking s' appeals to you, buy it.",

Here's a list of some of the innumerable shortcomings of this game:  -Game experiences giant FPS drops out of nowhere -Graphics don't even come close to looking like the trailer, even on a high-end SLI-Titans rig -Glitches everywhere, anywhere from wonky camera angles to falling through the world -uPlay is STILL entirely useless and unnecessary, and should be put out of its misery -Story is incredibly tasteless and cliché, full of one-dimensional characters, boring dialogue, repetitive NPCs -STILL COSTS MONEY  Ubisoft has become famous for overhyping its games, but this is an all-time low. I sincerely hope that nobody else pays money for this game.",

Hacking makes up a big part of the game with the ability to hack cameras to observe enemies or to hack traffic lights to cause pursuing enemies to crash. Everything else in the game though just feels tacked on. The combat and stealth gets boring quickly. Missions are repetetive and mostly similar. I dont like the way the DLC was handled either. The only way to get it all is to buy the deluxe edition and season pass but for the most part it's not worth buying anyway.  Good points: -Hacking is fun and the most original feature of the game. I had more fun hacking cameras in areas where enemies were patrolling and causing things to explode to kill them than i did killing enemies the traditional way. - The game looks nice and the city is quite good as well.  Bad points: - The protaganist Aiden just isnt likeable at all and the story isnt very good either. - Stuff like combat and driving could have done with more polish. - Story missions get repetitive as they mostly seem to follow a formula of sneak into an area, hack something then try to escape from pursuing police or fixers. I feel like they could have done so much more with the hacking to add more variety to missions. - As it's an open world Ubisoft game there are of course loads of filler side missions. - The game was quite buggy at times with one particular bug causing me to repeatedly fail a story mission. Luckily i found a workaround on the internet but it's pretty unforgiveable to have something like that left unfixed. - The way DLC was handled in a pretty greedy fashion. Want all the DLC? Well you have to buy the season pass and Deluxe Edition. However excluding Bad Blood the DLC is mostly crap and just adds cosmetic stuff of a couple side missions which aren't great anyway.  Overall i cant really recommend this game unless you can pick it up really cheap. Dont bother with any DLC apart from Bad Blood which adds a new campaign and isnt too bad a campaign at that.",

Gameplay: I like the main characters ability to hack into most things and actually get away with it. Fool ppl and steal stuff like money, cars etc. The aiming of the guns is pretty cool and accurate, can kill ppl from a pretty far distance.. snipe them away. There are minor missions like hacking to invade someone privacy/money, killing off gangbosses, stealing cars while evading the cops, chasing ppl to kill them in the end (as soon as you downloaded their data. And there is more..  DLC wise.. DLC - Bad Blood, is fun because you do not get bothered with defending ppl on streets like you do wih the main story. Theres extra missions to earn extra clothes and traits, varying from placing bombs to car chases and killing badguys.  Online play? As for online play, I been hacked once by someone online killed this person and chose to not play online because I do not like it. My Uplay is in offline mode and I use none of the online play options for that matter.  As for bugs and crashes.. I haven´t gotten any bugs since it was updated.  More tips to get it less jerky?? Try lowering settings, helped me a lot on my old pc and it is fully playable. But can´t say that it helps for everybody, not everyone has the same exact pc. Update your videocard through software.  Edit: On my newer pc, vsync on full and the other buffer option on one makes it completely smooth, even when driving. The rest is on ultra.  Recommend it?

            "review_text": "REVIEW ON WATCH DOGS   (spoilers In a way)    Ive been playing this enough to know the main importance of the game. Lets start with the good things, The concept of the hacking is amazing. There are so many things to do with hacking going from destroying a whole gang with just the things around them or doing a complete chase where you have the advantage from putting bridges up to putting up road spikes to block their path. Also I love the details, I love how much effort they put into making it feel like your just another criminal or vigilante in chicago. With all the different types of areas there are to all the different hot spots and stores there are. The final great thing about this is the all of the side quests you can do. There are side quests everywhere going from random criminal activity to destroying a whole gang going all the way to transporting cars while getting chased by the police. It adds so much more experience without having to do the campaign. Also its a good way not to get bored.  Now lets get onto the bad things about Watch_Dogs, We all know when a game first comes out it will have some bugs here and there. Until the next couple updates expect some of this, You will experience lag when drive to fast, sometimes when you go to a new location it will lag, and sometimes it will take forever to find people online. Another bad thing are the AI's They are terrible at reacting to things. When you see AI's you would usually open a profiler and see what they are like or who they are or what type of aids or etc, but no one realizes how they react to things. When you run into them and their car is severly damaged or just is not on the road wouldnt u think they should get out of that car and see whats going on or would you just let them act normally and drive like it was any other day. Also when a car is on fire they just run away and no one else does its just them. Its common sense to run away from a burning car isnt it? Finally I think they need to fix how easy it is to get money. If you just keep your profiler on and just go straight in the downtown part of chicago it is so easy to find people with bank accounts/rich bank accounts. All you do is hack them and make sure its not a blume affiliate. You can literally make 50k in 5-10 minutes by walking. You can do this right after the first mission too so my recommendation is try and make it feel harder to get money by either not using profiler as much or just dont hack bank accounts.   My rating: 7/10 By the game? !YES! p.s try and focus on the good things A.I's dont matter most of the time anyways",

I get annoyed with the game when I can't finish a mission, but not so annoyed that I stop playing- it's a perfect balance for me- challenging enough that I fail once in a while but engaging enough and not so hard that I don't want to keep trying till I get it. Not too hard, not too easy. (you can choose to play a higher difficulty if you want)   There is usually a way to accomplish a task without shooting people, often it's easier to take out a few with hacks and then blast the rest.

The game is no longer receiving updates, which is frustrating because it still has numerous serious performance problems even on powerful computers.  The game elements are completely identical to that of every Ubisoft game, and the ending was completely given away by a grade-school attempt at foreshadowing.",

In the time it takes to to disable a guy, after you chased him down, who isn't slowed by a shot in the leg, people in cars drive up do you and shoot at you while they drive...which you can't do. At the very least make the character invulnerable while you run the cinematic take down.  You have no tools to disable large groups of people, or even a single person at range. No tools to disable cars without potentially killing the driver.  All of this leads to a lot of 'You killed the child rap ist you terrible person...try again..and again...and again'. I'm fine with a bigger reward for take downs, but mandatory no kills just make the game un fun. Repeatedly trying to hit a guy with a stick while he blasts you with a shotgun is dumb.",

Occasionally, you'll press a button to hack or do a takedown and it won't register that you pressed it, even if you visibly mashed the key into oblivion. If you know anything about networking, the 'hacking' is hilarious, but in a way, it adds a lot of comedic value to the game. Some of the missions make downtown Chicago feel more like downtown Baghdad, and it really breaks any feelings of immersion. Outside of those issues, it's an okay game if you just want to mess around, do some decently fun missions, maybe take down some civilians, and outrun the cops, but don't expect it to be the next GTA or anything. 7/10 decently playable.",

It reminded me of the GTA and a little bit of the Far Cry series (being in third person shooter and relying on stealth). If you really like sneaking around and subduing enemies quietly or if you liked the GTA series, I woud highly reccommend this game.   ",
