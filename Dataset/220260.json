It's also fully moddable, with a thriving modding community. It's bug free, and runs on relatively low end machines. Works on my four year old rig.",

I highly recommend modding the game with simple things like trailers, extra tractors, and trucks these will make the gameplay much more enjoyable.",

I also think that the vehicle simulation is pretty good. When you drive tractors, you actually feel like you are pulling something and the harvesters are really fun to operate. There is also a good variety of crops and getting to all of them takes some effort.  What I dislike is the fact that you start out with a really big farm in terms of buildings and stuff. I would so much like to build everything myself, just starting out with a small field and some equipment. I also miss seasons and crop rotations, as well as fatigue.  While the game is somewhat shallow in terms of the overall mechanics, it is still a lot of fun to play.",

At first, it seems like a simple farming game, until out of nowhere there are North Korean soldiers overrunning your peaceful farm. Fighters and bombers soar overhead, aircraft drop legions of paratroopers onto the farmland you so meticulously tilled as you realize that you, a lone farmer, are the last line of defense from foreign invaders. You prepare for war by breaking out that rifle you kept to ward off thiefs, along with thousands of rounds of ammunition, rocket launchers, grenades, anti aircraft guns, and that Davy Crockett you kept for those special occasions. As you fight through your blood soaked little property, you must continue to make those crucial crop deliveries in order to help sustain the crumbling war effort. The delivery missions are brutal, as you must guide your tractor convoy to its destination through complex ambushes, IEDs, and indirect fire. If you want a raw, relentless, and authentic farming/Red Dawn simulator, look no further. This is the game to get. 10/10",

            "review_text": "Summary: A game for those who don't care whether their farm has aliens they need to fight off, or NPCs they can romance. This game doesn't have that. It has farming equipment and a great environment for people looking for a relaxing evening or a great co-operative experience with friends who enjoy simulated farming with heavy equipment.   Hours of fun: *Varies - If you like simulators then it may well be infinite Suggested Retail Value: $20 Graphics: 7/10 Voice-acting: NA - No voice-acting Music/SFX: NA - Calm music on menus only Uniqueness: 5/10 First Play-through Experience: 8/10 Replay Value: 9/10  If you have any love for simulated farming then I doubt you would regret paying up to $20 for the full version. I was introduced to the game through a friend who had put in 100s of hours and just convinced me to give it a try so I could experience what he loved so much about it. I didn't expect it to be this much fun, but it's a blast on co-op play.  After a stressful day, I can sit back and relax and handle issues as they rise. Choosing to pace myself in the game by switching it to real-time and literally doing needed chores then watching the beautiful sunset or... whatever.  Then, when I'm feeling ambitious, we both hop into our private server and divy up the tasks at hand, co-operating in beautiful harmony to bring our farm ever closer to being a mega-success.  It's hard to describe how it feels to grow a farm from humble beginnings with one small field to a booming business with dozens of fields, 1000s of tons of equipment, and a ranch boasting hundreds of animals, but I highly recommend sharing it with friends.  To help with that, the game has an incredible community. Whether you're looking to see the mods that are available, wanting to create your own, looking for a buddy to chat with while you drive the harvesters, or wanting to join a sever with dozens of players trying to achieve a shared farm (even splitting up the tasks, creating jobs, dolling out wages, the whole deal!) the truth is you'll find it all here.  I say this about few games (Skyrim readily comes to mind) but FS 2013 feels less like a game and more like a world you visit for as long as you like. Highly recommended if the above sounds interesting to you.",

You simply choose a crop from four possible seeds to start your career, plant it in your field, harvest it, sell it and put that cash back into the farm. It’s almost impossible to damage your crops unless you’re not paying attention, so it’s difficult to fail or find yourself in a no-win situation.  It's the best game you can play in co-op strategy",

            "review_text": "As a little boy whose parents and grandparents farmed, I grew up in the 1980s pushing little diecast Ertl tractors around on the carpet and making my own tractor sounds, pretending to be a farmer and working my own imaginary fields. Now that I'm an adult, I have enjoyed hours and hours of challenging farming satisfaction thanks to Farming Simulator 2013.   The Titanium add-ons have added literally hundreds of hours of fun trying out new equipment, and the Westbridge Hills map was a terrific purchase because it more closely resembles the area where my family farmed in Michigan.   I'm currently downloading FS 2015, and while doing so I thought I would put in a good word for FS 2013. Some people might not understand the appeal of a farm sim, but once you begin you're almost immediately hooked. I became bored with Facebook-based games like Farmville within minutes, but I was blown away by how engaging and realistic FS 2013 is, and having seen gameplay footage of FS 2015 I realize it was just the next step in the evolution of farming sims. You plant crops, care for animals and slowly amass a fortune as you build a business in a very realistic manner. I told my parents I started a game and had three tractors, $50,000 in the bank and $150,000 in debt and they said, 'Well, that sounds like real farming!' The mowing missions give you a quick boost financially, for example you can earn $11,000 for mowing a patch of grass at the golf course. That's slightly unrealistic, but considering my mowing rig costs about $70,000 it's realistic in that you have to buy the equipment and then do the work until the gear 'pays for itself.'  Farming Simulator 2013 is seriously challening on the Hard difficulty level. Your crops are worth very little and money is much more difficult to come by. Even on easy mode where the cash flows a little more freely, I've wasted entire days trying to reach a certain dollar amount. There's always something to do, there's always something to buy. Every thing you want to do - i.e. raise cattle to sell milk daily -- requires specific equipment and the know-how to use it, sometimes trial and error -- and while the game cannot be absolutely true-to-life, I think it does a terrific job conveying the experience of trying to make a living as a farmer. You can even buy a few wind turbines and let the cash roll in as you amass a collection of classic tractors like a lot of the old-timers around here have been doing for the past several years. Likewise, you can invest in more land, more gear and more employees like a lot of the bigger family operations around here and turn yourself into a business-savvy Ag baron.  BOTTOM LINE: It's a big -- no gigantic -- sandbox full of almost every real life piece of gear you could hope to purchase from many notable brands -- except for John Deere, of course, which publishes its own game that I haven't played because it costs $80. Since I've begun playing FS 2013 I've noticed real farmers in my area using the same gear that I've purchased in the game and I admire the detail the designers put into each round baler and Case IH harvester. I get to play along without having the financial responsiblity of purchasing a $500,000 Grimme self-propelled sugar beet harvester. If you were a farm kid like me who went to college and found a career in the city, this game lets you experience what might have been had you chosen to try to turn the family farm into an Ag empire.  Highly, highly recommended. I have spent nearly 450 hours playing this game -- which is a little shocking -- and honestly, I still haven't planted every single field the game has to offer. Some gamers complain about minor imperfections, but I grew up playing an Atari 2600 and the original NES. This game is sweet!",

There are a few minor comments to make, though. I might be a city gal, but I do know that chickens do NOT feed themselves, and that a henhouse needs a door so that the chickens can actually get in to lay their eggs and keep them safe against Mr Fox! I haven't bought any sheep or cows yet, but from the manual I get the impression that not much work, apart from making fodder, is expected there either.  Also, I doubt whether even the most dedicated farmer can do without any sleep at all.  Secondly, the world of Farming is a bit 'dead', In the town and on the campsite there are a few people shambling about, but that's about it. There's never anyone on the golfcourse, or in any of the other fields. And where are the birds? Where are the crows? On the good side nature, landscape, sky and weather patterns are a joy to see and watch. Machinery and crop are beyond perfect. So, all in all, 9 points out of 10, and highly recommended, nevertheless!",

I also think that you should not be able to clip through the people walking around the map and you should be fined for things like hitting them or driving on the sidewalk or doing other things that you shouldn't be able to do in real life.

I enjoy the rewards of raising crops and animals to earn money in order to further grow my farm, buy land, buy animals and add more equipment. The other aspect that this game really expands on is the mods. Almost limitless modding.  I would rank this simulation game just above Euro Truck Simulator 2.

CONS: - I wanted to die while I played this... - It's a simulator about farming - and yep, you guessed it, it's 'somewhat' realistic. That means it's so frightfully boring and dull you'll have trouble stopping your brain from exploding. - There are in excess of 3000 people who own this game who gave it the thumbs up... Why is that a CON? Well... let's put it this way, the type of people who'd most likely give this a thumbs up probably like watching grass grow, and can't get enough of farming so they turn to a simulator to continue the experience into the evening. I'm shocked. Seriously I am.  SUMMARY: It's not that the game is terrible. In fact, you could very reasonably argue that in playing a farming simulator, you need to set your expectations lower than a crack ho' turning tricks with Jack the Ripper. But here's the thing - even knowing it's a farming simulator, it still was so awfully dull, so painfully boring that I can't believe I played as long as I did.  I mowed some grass at a golf course, I drove a tractor with a trailor perfectly lined up next to a harvester to catch wheat, then dumped said wheat in a grain silo, I took a load of peanuts to a place so they could attract a runaway elephant back (yep, you heard me right), i sold a tractor, I ploughed a field. Then I realised I was SPENDING MINUTES OF MY LIFE, JUST WASTING AWAY DOING THIS!!!!  The tutorial was mildly amusing for 5 minutes, then the game just continues the awful, mind-sapping exercise.

Meanwhile there is no way to automate anything, you literally have to drive your tractor to the chicken yard then get out and run around picking up eggs. OK there is one thing you can automate...a half ♥♥♥♥♥ worker to drive the harvester. Did you want to sell eggs? well IF you can find the place to do it (since the ingame map barely functional) after you ran around like an idiot picking them up THEN you drive your tractor to that place and sell them. Same silly plan with sheep and cows. And crops for that matter.
