            "review_text": "The game itself can be enjoyable, however there are a bunch of things holding it back:  - The camera control is super clunky and sluggish, no way to rotate too.  - No speed-up time feature, you have to watch the ball slowly make its way to the end every time, if you failed too bad you're gonna waste your time just sitting there watching the ball again.  - Every time you place something you gotta click on inventory to open it then click on the thing, over and over, doesn't matter if you're gonna place the same kind of gadget. It sounds minor, but gets irratating after playing for like 15 minutes.  - Sometimes the ball would stop moving for no reason, and you have to reset the level and watch it slowly make its progress again.  - Gadgets glitch out and you can't click on them after reseting the ball, so what you need to do is reset the whole level and place every gadged again.  - The ball is constantly slow-ish, no matter if it goes through speed boosts.  - There is no indicator of how far the ball will be thrown by some of the gadgets, so you're left experimenting until you get it right, not because the puzzle is hard, but because the game failes to give you useful information.  - First 30 or so puzzle were really easy, don't know if they become hard at some point, but I personally don't have the patience to play anymore.  That being said, the game can be enjayable for those with patience and high tolerance. I personally won't play much more and can't recommend it because of the reasons stated above.",
