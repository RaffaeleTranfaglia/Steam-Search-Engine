So you're paying for something where you get blocked from accessing half the content.  Game also has fairly frequent desktop crashes.  Buy if you enjoy throwing money into a fire.",

            "review_text": "Excellent game. The entire series is one of my all time favorites.   Essense of the game play is to Gather creatures as an army and fight an opponent with their army in a turn based hex grid. Has some extra gaming features by the addition of the Valkyries and Runes compared to prior King's bounty games. Has three skill trees to build your character thereby offering replayability, similar to prior King's bounty games. Some skills remain, some have changed.   Has numerous achievements to drive towards if you're that way inclined.   Takes about 80-100 hours to play it through to completion doing most quests.   Gold is easy to come by, so buy all equipment/artifacts. destroy for crystals or feed to the valkyries to raise their level.  Make sure you have the Valkyries all at level 3 before entering Demonis otherwise you have to play again to get that achievement. Also to get to level 70 you can't allow the Elf troups to become Neutral in the second act (so avoid going to Rezo in Arcania until you've cleaned them out) otherwise even with the skill that gives 15% extra experience you still won't get to it. (I finished the game at level 66 and quite simply there was nothing left to fight).     ",

A spell the lizardmen cast reliably drops to desktop. Saving after every fight isn't enough.  Even with a patch, which I wouldn't expect for this miserable cashgrab, it still would be a step down from an already pretty dissapointing retread.",

The bugs have been ironed out, so if you're a KB player or it's on sale, I would buy it for some viking fun in the frozen north.  If you are new to King's Bounty, pic your flavor. Original is classic. Princess (which comes in two forms, regular and Crossworlds- crossworlds being a larger and more complete version) you can play with your pet dragon and fly your pegasus. WoTN is obviously viking and has all the improvments of the series and some new features incorporated into it.",

The game even gives you a gimmick item that can be used to help against the enemy.  There is only one bad point: Boss fighting. That gimmick item that helps you partway through the game? It's useless against the boss. The devs went and disabled it saying that the boss needs a 'Fighting Chance'. If they wanted to give the boss a fighting chance they should not have given us the gimmick item in the first place. Either that or they should have at least did some sort of nerfing on the effects of the item when fighting bosses.  For the price it's worth and the length of the game it may be worth it. However, the fact that this happened feels like this game needs to be worth a bit less. I'd suggest getting it for a discount price.",

It takes some time to get used to it especially the battle gameplay, it has its flaws like the camera system but overall it is a good game.  THE GOOD: -Nice graphics -Good music -Interesting battle gameplay -Full of sidequests.  THE BAD -The camera system -It can be complicated to understand at the beginning  -No voice acting or cutscenes, there's a lot of text -After a while, it may feel repetitive and a little tedious",

The new tale takes place in the familiar world of Endoria featured in the previous games, but begins in the Viking lands, which the celebrated hero Bill Gilbert never visited during his famous quest in King’s Bounty: The Legend.   The Mighty Olaf, son of the Konung of Northlings, has dedicated his life to battling the undead who have infested the northern lands of Endoria. He seeks to liberate the snowy wastes, dwarven dungeons, and the very heart of Endoria, the kingdom of Darion itself, from the dark grip of necromancy. On his quest towards immortal glory he will encounter cunning foes and new friends, hard battles and amazing adventures.",

I had a hard time clicking yes to recommend it because honestly, I love the KB games but this one went on for 50 hours too long. This is the game that put me off the last game they released and possibly future editions. I really want to support this franchise but it needs to look back at its roots about why its a good game. One of the reasons was never because you play it for 120 hours going back and forth delivering messages to people you dont care about.   Honestly, drop the story lines and just have me look for the treasure like in KB the original. That was all I wanted to do. treat it as a 4X game without the Roleplay.",

I found no solution online. I heard others had unplayable crash to desktop issues later in the game as well so I just uninstalled the expansion and played the vanilla.   The vanilla game is better but it's clear the company is milking this game dry without improving anything. The developers are getting really lazy. It still crashes a lot. Some new spells are unplayable. They reuse the same EXACT maps from the previous games (yet again). The story is boring. Most of the quests, as usual, are also boring and require you to go back and forth endlessly. I'm pretty sure this is how they boast of a 'long play time', half your time is going back and forth for stupid quests or fighting just tons and tons of mobs for pitiful xp instead of giving you fewer battles with more exp, for example.   I'm slugglishly trying to finish this game. There is no way I'm buying another expansion based on this same game engine. They need to invest in this franchise with all the money they made and build a new game engine; make this game quality again like it was with the 'Legend'. This franchise is going down the tubes just like Heroes of Might and Magic, ironically, since they are similar genres.",
