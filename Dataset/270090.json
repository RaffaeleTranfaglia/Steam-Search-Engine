            "review_text": "I don't even know where to begin. Between the horrible pseudo-retro graphics and below-average run of the mill twin-stick shooting, this game is contender for one of the  worst  I've ever played. There were no positives to this game except that it had trading cards, and even then that was stiffled by the fact you have to play this game for around two hours to get them.  I  genuinely  like video games and can find even the  smallest  smidge of entertainment in them, even the bad ones. I was unable to find any such entertainment here. The game is a chore to play and there is no real incentive to actually do so. No plot, no real motivation besides 'do that'. Now, 'do that' isn't such a bad thing in and of itself. Mario would still be just as good of a game if it had no plot due to its addictive gameplay and responsive controls.  This game is no Mario .   With a game that has no real story beyond a few lines of text, you would expect the gameplay to be unique or interesting. This has  neither  of those things. You simply shoot at enemies that could only be described as something the designers doodled up in the allotted hour of time they were given before the game was shipped to release and save junkies. They're reminiscent of enemies from a bad flash game you could find on a website that hasn't been updated since the year 2000. While struggling to find out if that blue blob you're shooting at is actually meant to be something other than a blue blob, you're also struggling with the controls themselves while you try to save junkies left about the city.   In a Shoot 'Em Up styled game, the  most important  part of that game are the controls. Why in God's green Earth would you release a Shoot 'Em Up that has blocky controls? Why in God's green Earth would you release said Shoot 'Em Up with  NO  gamepad support? Why is this still a thing in the year 2014? I can only hope and imagine that the developers were unable to provide players with such amenities because they had run out of time within their one hour deadline to get the game finished. It's completely unacceptable in this day and age for these things to not be resolved or dealt with.  Overall this game is rubish and that's putting it  lightly . Most of whatever trivial amount of time they spent on developing this game went towards the graphics that are more cringe inducing than they are interesting to look at, and sadly that's probably the main selling point to anyone who's interested in purchasing a game like this. Skip this game, as it's not worth the time or money.",

            "review_text": "//N.P.P.D. RUSH// - The Milk Of Ultraviolet... The title of the game already suggests this probably won't be the most standard game you've ever seen. Well let me tell you this game is far from standard.  Like Rail Slave Games second game 'Uriel's Chasm' this game tries to be unique with their retro look, which is OK as long as the game is fun to play, but that's the part where this game fails miserably.  You play as a robot (at least i think it's a robot) and ride around and shoot other robots and other vermin. The real problem of this game are the graphics. You hardly can see what is what, which makes the game almost unplayable but even if the graphics didn't put you off then there's the hard difficulty and the time limit.   To be honest for me there's no reason why I should want to continue playing this game but perhaps there are some people out there who like this weird style of games.... i'm just not one of them.

Every kill is accompanied by a large blood splatter on your screen, regardless of your distance from the target. This is constant, and is hugely distracting. There are enemies that emit familiar bullet-hell patterns, but the jittery movement of your bike and the zoomed-in camera leave you utterly unable to deal with most threats. If the camera were adjustable and the blood splatters were turned off, this might be a decent game.",

            "review_text": "So, it's ostensibly a 'retro' shooter, in the twin-stick style, comeplete with odd colour palletes and scanlines, but 'N.P.P.D. RUSH' (I'm not typing the full title) has some major issues.  Old/retro games had to work with hardware limitations, like the nunber of colours which could be displayed at once and per sprite, scanlines on the display hardware and so on, and this tended to lead to cleaner but more abstract display. Unfortunately that's not the case here.  While the noisy display this may be the art style, its done terribly. What you get is a confusing mess which means you can't instantly tell enemies from the backgrounds. The scanlines don't help, either - they seem to be applied on the display when its being rendered, and then again (optionally this time) on the final result, leaving a terrible moiré pattern mess.  Add to this a camera which zooms out slowly when you move, but almost instantly snaps back to a close up (meaning you can't even see the thing you were shooting at any more), and the mouse movement being locked to the player, so you need to constantly make adjustments, and you have something which is unfortunately signficantly sub-par.  Nice concept, poor execution.",

            "review_text": "Graphics: The art style is reminiscent of 80s arcades, but the execution isn’t near as crisp as many of those machines had. With a generally muddy palette in ones way, there are smog clouds that will obscure your vision of anything beneath them, including some of the more camouflaged enemies. Even in some of the brighter areas, of metallic and blue floors it’s easy to miss a lot of the information presented to you. The enemies are easy enough to identify from each other, but more often than not hard to identify from the environment. Other than the hard to distinguish enemies and muddiness, another issue with the visuals is the weird overlays that happen either when you’re hit or you kill an enemy. When hit the screen gets a lot of blue flashes, which wouldn’t be so bad if it were restricted to the edges but goes all over and makes it very hard to see. This also happens with a blood splatter overlay that happens when one kills an enemy. It’s horribly distracting and possibly seizure-rific. The standard paint job of your Rush unit is very pink/purple, which makes it very easy to distinguish from everything else, and the junkies you are to rescue are bright purple, making them beacons for easy pick up. The paint job of your Rush unit however can be changed in the games ‘Config’ menu, if the standard colors just aren’t for you. That being said, the one time I changed the colors, I got set of grey and yellow, which got lost in the environment just like mostly everything else. That being said, I hope you like the default resolution and quality settings, because you can’t change them what-so-ever.  Gameplay: The controls of this game are just god awful, with WASD as your movement and mouse for aiming and shooting. While this doesn’t sound horrible at first, the spastic movements from both and the lack of any sensitivity options or even a calibration, will make you curse at the lack of controller support. Without the option to customize anything control wise, you’ll find yourself trying to hit escape to pause, which stupidly closes the entire game. The is no way to pause that I have found, and the only way to get any time to stop is get all the way to the stairs. The stairs are always at the beginning of the level but the maps are so confusing  The stairs, a static little hub, where shops and, for obvious reasons, the ability to go between floors lie. It’s kind of odd that you would use stairs though, as you’re kind of permanently attached to a motorcycle. The shops are pretty over priced for the amount of cash that drops from enemies, and unfortunately the only way to add time to the limit.   Audio: Well at least the tunes are kinda cool. It does set up a hectic cyberpunk world with some decently executed buttrock. You can also adjust the volume mid-game which is a major improvement over any other setting. The stairs and other semi safe zones are calming, while the levels themselves are loud and hectic. The sound effects are not horribly distracting, but you will come to hate the sound of your weapon after a while.  Plot:  //N.P.P.D.RUSH//  - The milk of Ultra violet is a 2D Twin stick shooter. In a cyberpunkish dystopia of an alternate 198X, where a designer drug called ‘Nox’ has completely screwed the city of Nauseous Pines. You play a former Nox addict who now has no limbs, due to said drug making them useless, who is plugged into some sort of battle motorcycle called a Rush. Tasked with rescuing other Nox junkies from the cities hellscape, where enough enemies lie in wait to make it a decently hectic bullet hell.  However rescuing other Nox junkies before it’s too late isn’t your only objective. Through play you will learn the origin of Nox and the identities and stories behind some of the games characters. That is if you can make it that far.  Verdict: I can actually see there being an audience for this, but for me, it’s not worth the 3.99 it’s currently selling for. I also cannot tell you what kind of mileage you’re looking at for completing this game. There are Steam Trading cards but I’m not sure who would really want a badge for this game other than some of the hardcore badge creators.  This is a solid Uninstall and forget for me. ",

First of all, I enjoyed what little I could get out of the game, but that doesn't mean I reccomend anyone plays this unless you're willing to try something very, very different.  There's really not a whole lot about to say about the game, other than the graphics are 'good' for 1980s, the soundtrack is alright but reptitive, and by the time you finally manage to beat the game you'll never want to pick it up again.  Pretty much a 'bullet hell' type game, there's not a whole lot of ways to dodge the bullets in confined spaces at 15-20 FPS gameplay.  If you're really planning on playing this game, buy it when it's 10-50 cents or a dollar, because there's no way this is worth even three bucks.",

Whether this game is worth having depends on whether you like retro top-down twin stick shooters---you move using WASD and have 360 degree range of shooting using your mouse to direct endless stream of bullets. The shooting goes off screen, so one of the basic strategies in this game is to shoot as much stuff as possible off screen, which requires keeping a bit of a mental of map of the area since you only see a screenful at any one time. It does remind me of some old NES games, but has a different flavor, given the subject matter that is a bit dark. Also to be honest, this game is little more than running around shooting and collecting things. The story, as it is, is infinitely ignorable.  Granted the game is not the latest greatest twinstick shooter, but unlike many of that genre, this is relatively easy to play for some mindless fun. While this game has the tag of bullet hell, it does not really fall in that subgenre, since you can generally avoid being immersed in a screenful of bullets, which is typically not an option in a true bullet hell shooter.  The game lacks basic stuff like configuring options, and even quiting (use Q) is initially obvious, but looking past these minor shortcomings, this game can lead to a few hours of mild enjoyment for those that appreciate mindless twin stick shooters.",
