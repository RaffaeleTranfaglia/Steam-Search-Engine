            "review_text": "After playing this game for some time now I can clearly make my mind up to recommend it. Initially I was not too sure about trying out another Zombie-FPS but I can't deny that I found myself playing this game more than I first expected to. Smooth gameplay and steady advancement through the story made it suprisingly fun to play. Especially the fact that you can blow every single zombie to pieces makes it fun to even just keep running around and killing zombies all day long instead of actually progressing through the story :P The game really knows how to set the mood when it comes to level design, for example by making the deserted city at the 2nd part of the story rather dark and gloomy and adding to the atmosphere by adding constant, heavy rain, giving it a way more secluded and opressive feeling.  I admit that the battle mechanics lack a little bit of depth and occasionally though the wall clipping enemies can be a little annoying but the simplicity of the fights has still somehow a almost classic and satisfying feeling to it.  Overall I would rate the game 6.5 out of 10 and some things that should be improved soon would be: -splash damage of the rocket launcher -enemies occasionally clipping through walls -possiblity to change setting ingame without having to return to the main menu -maybe slightly different sounds for dfferent types of weapons  Besides this the game feels rather well balanced, not making any weapon too OP or way weaker than others. Considering that the things I disliked about the game can be easily fixed, I have no doubts that this game has a bright future once it takes care of the earlier mentioned problems ^_^",

Some soldiers shoot through the walls in Bunker so that needs to be fixed as well.",

            "review_text": "In Chasing Dead you play a character named Jack who finds himself in an airplane that is infected with zombies. After fighting himself through the airplane, he jumped of just to figure out that there are even more zombies coming for him.  Chasing Dead shines in setting a mood right for a horror game. It has superb background music that really gets your adrenaline pumping and keeps you on your toes. Combined with some nice jump scares it really reminds me at the old days when I was playing Resident Evil 4:) And there are not that much games that manage to do that.  The voice acting, especially the dialog between Jack and his friend, is topnotch and up there with any AAA title. During the cutscenes that you get after completing mission you see real person talking to you. Usually I wouldn't be a fan of that idea but they managed to surprise me ;P The style of the cutscenes really fit the style of the game and they underline the already great horror setting of the game.  The graphics of the game are decent, nothing special but not bad either. One thing that surprised me tho that the game supported a nativ 21:9 ratio, something that isn't even supported in all AAA titles ;). It is what you would expect from an indie game. Talking of indie games, it does also have a limited amount of setting that you can play around with. You can rebind your keys which is a good thing and switch between preset graphic settings. The only thing that is missing is a mouse sensitivity slider, the option to turn off mouse acceleration and a fov slider. But that's nothing that they cant add through a future patch, also if you choose to play with a controller then it's no problem at all.  So bottom line is that if you are looking for a great zombie horror game that manages to actually set up a horrifying mood then definitely buy this game!",

            "review_text": "Its a decent game.  Pros:  Feels more of a open world when you are outside, feel like you can go anywhere though I dont think its necessary to leave the area. The environment is big so you'll have more open when fighting zombies and mutants.  The weapons in this game is pretty good, not alot but its fairly good.  Interesting boss fights.  At some point, you get to ride the tank, something you dont usually see in a zombie apocalypse.  Cons:  The ending, leading to 'to be continued' with a cliffhanger even though I wish it could have ended it with a bang, but its not THAT big of a deal though. So dont mind this.  The control of the tank, while its fun to ride a tank the controls suck. I had a hard time getting used to it and still not used to it after beating the game. I had to do some strategy since the tank is pretty much invincible when you get off the tank. And if you get on later, it instantly regenerates.  Subtitles are extremely inaccurate, you can easily tell if you listen to their voices and read the subtitles at the same time. Most of a time its way off. You can have a protagonist saying 'Roger that' with a subtitle that said 'Will do'. Thats how bad it is.  Overall:   As I said above, its a decent game. Its primarily focused on missons and it tends to be short. There is no saves but it can save your progress once you beat that level, you can tell with its statistics coming up. Theres checkpoints as well if you die and you get those checkpoints by reaching to your objective, only loss is your weapons you've obtained and you may either stick with your default weapons or no weapons depending on the level. While it is short when it comes to missions, but theres many which is enough for you to entertain.",

Cons: Cut-scenes are very basic and not very interesting since it’s mostly just one person talking to you.  Animation needs a lot of work both in terms of variety and quality.",

            "review_text": "Every now and again I like punishing myself. Sometimes you know that a game is going to be mediocre or even downright suck, but you get in your thicker than a concrete block noggin that you're going to play it and the lord protect the man, woman or beast that tries to stop you. The horror bug bit me in the early 80s at three years old; first with movies and then with video games in the earlier half of the 90s. Eventually, I'll get around to seeing every movie, playing every game, etc. that relates to the genre.   At $20+ Chasing Dead was not even tempting for me to buy. I more or less knew what I was going to get, so I waited till the price dropped considerably. $9.99, hey cool, at least I won't kill myself with Burger King or some other garbage with those couple of dollars...harm reduction my friends. So, I picked this up to plow through another zombie shooter. From the fantastically terrible Land of the Dead to the entertaining Zombi on Wii to the top down slaughterhouse magic of Splatter...I give 'em all a try. So, I laid down my digital cash and spent a night n' a half with Chasing Dead.   First up, this game isn't going to take you long to beat. On the hardest setting (glitches and horse manure included) it took me roughly 4 1/2 hours to finish spread across a day and a half. I could see people rounding up the torches, rope and a tree for a good Wild West hanging if they spent $24.99 on this mess. Yeah, Chasing Dead is a mess. It's a kinda trashy, MILDLY fun B movie/exploitation mess at that, but gamers looking for a gory, well-made time waster won't be having this for dinner.   You play as action movie cliche soldier, Jake, a lousy one-liner spoutin', gun in each hand Duke Nukem wannabe if there ever was one. Ol' Jake kicks off his adventure on a crashing plane and makes a rough landing on doppelganger version of Earth where zombies, ogre lookin' boss idiots, flying robot drones, renegade soldiers and other lunkheads all want to kill you. Simply put, you'll mow down foes with a decent selection of guns, clear the planet of hostiles level by level and accomplish standard mission objectives along the way. It's a simple formula borrowed from a million other shooters before it, but Chasing Dead gets the bare minimum job done in this respect.   The environments on Earth Vol. 2 are pretty crappy looking. Graphics are not this game's strong suit and you've seen better modeled monsters and level design in just about any similar horror game you can think of. It's suitable but it's not pretty. On a souped up Alienware PC things didn't run smoothly; framerates were crapping out during heavily populated frays and boss battles which got more annoying than Chinese water torture the more I played. Ontop of that hit-detection is poor with Jake's shooting on par to a blind man without glasses trying to get a ringer in an afternoon game of horseshoes. You'll blast enemies in the head and they either won't go down (most likely registering hits somewhere else on their bodies) or completely whiff. Prepare to die a few cheap deaths, although the game itself isn't impossible in difficulty, so it won't hold you back too often. Audio doesn't fare any better with cheesy, stock beastie groans n' grumbles and bosses that sound like they are more likely to tickle your feet with a feather than beat you to a bloody pulp. A nondescript soundtrack, terrible voice-acting (sometimes hilarious) and lightweight weapon FX give the game's presentation all of the sharpness of a dull Ginsu that can't even slice a tomato. As stated the cutscenes are done FMV style like an old adventure game which makes no sense whatsoever other than adding to the B-movie stink that permeates every poor of this game. Most scenes are acted in the dark with the actors/actresses looking down READING DIRECTLY FROM THE SCRIPT. It's hysterical at first but this kind of cheese is best reserved for a movie. You'll be reaching for the skip button quick. My favorite parts are whenever the actors have to get up to run from something that suddenly 'smoked out' their location. The whole spiel is the kinda bad they don't make a name for.   Bad animation seeps into the gameplay with the aforementioned FPS dips and rotten hit detection. This can be correct somewhat if you zoom in with the ironsights but nothing is a science in this game. Most of your enemies are dumber than dirt and you'll progress via firepower overload alone. Jake can carry two weapons at anytime and there's a nice selection. Zombies fall pretty easily and are generally wimps even on the hardest setting which will turn off anybody looking for a stiff challenge and a frequent checkpoint system makes sure you won't fall behind too far if you do happen to die. To Chasing Dead's merit the later levels are a bit more fun and less generic (than the standard worntorn wastelands, abandoned industrial complexes, etc.) later on; a ghost town, haunted mansion, a firefight inside and atop a fast-moving train, and a few other interesting locales helping to break up the monotony a bit. Floating wraith enemies add a little spice here, at the trade of the player's wits when pitted against infuriating invisible opponents in the haunted mansion (they go down in three hits and you can find a scanner to detect their presence...still, with aiming and shooting as sh*tty as it is, you're gonna want to take a shotgun to your monitor).   A handful of sinister boss enemies stand in your way. I'm sure the developers wanted to think they are sinister but most of them are mutants that look like goofy trolls/ogres as opposed to zombies. They are wide targets, so even the wonky mechanics won't impede you from mowing them to bits. Again, the sluggish gameplay quirks and imprecise controls will probably get you murdered during the first mutant boss at least once until you find a way to work around them. That's the entire problem with Chasing Dead's 3-5 hour campaign; imprecision...a lack of polish or even the slightest bit of refinement to even the most rudimentary gameplay elements. Oh yeah, you also get to command a Hummer and a Tank in a few levels...the Hummer will probably go down in the history of gaming as the worst vehicle in a shooter on any platform during any era. It's THAT futtbucking godawful. You'll want to commit suicide before the first mile. For honesty's sake, the tank controls better and at least you can tackle the opposition with firepower as opposed to the Hummer's solitary 'run 'em over' attack.   There's a few Steam achievements for those into that sort of thing and getting eight of them was enough for me. Despite it's cheapness due to bad design, if you do play Chasing Dead go straight to Hard because it's not really that tough for the seasoned shooter vet. I consider myself above-average and I had to get my money's worth out of this monument to mediocrity. Sprinkled throughout the crap are a few fun moments and a couple of decent setpiece battles but you'd be wise to get this on a BIG sale if you just have to try it.   Pros:  -At it's best provides some comedic B-movie trash thrills.  -Decent weapon selection.  -A couple of fun setpiece battles.  -The boss fights are amusing when they're not half broken by bad mechanics.   Cons:  -At it's worst a filled diaper of anti-fun.  -Subpar graphics, terrible animation, framerate hiccups, wretched cutscenes and weak sound. -Poor controls. -Horrible hit detection. -Broken mechanics.  -Driving sequences are beyond human comprehension.  -No multiplayer (maybe a blessing?).  -A few hours of gameplay, once and done replay value and pricetag still too high.   Overall: 4/10  Chasing Dead is only a must buy for the most hardcore horror gamers. I'm glad I gave this and Back in 1995 chances for science's sake but if I didn't get to them so late I'd refund them both. There's SMALL doses of fun here but that's it.   ",
