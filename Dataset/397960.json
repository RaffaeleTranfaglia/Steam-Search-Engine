            "review_text": "Your grandfather wanted to find a treasure that he heard when he was stranded in the North Pole. He never returned from his second expedition. But you, you decide to find what happened. And guess what? You're stranded too... and with a traitor in the crew...  The plot is simple though I found the story short. The hours I've spent reflect the guide I've made about objects. But still, if the plot was beginning well, you have some holes: what happened to the captain? How come the mechanic was taken by the evil spirit if he was a prisonner?  The puzzles, if for some, are easy, for others, are quite a challenge. I had to skip some because it was a pain in the ♥♥♥ to try to catch the fish or you need to know the moon phases or you don't have real indication about how to solve that. The HO scenes were normal, though some items are difficult to spot, as they can be confused as part of another (got the case with a German grenade, where the handle was the same as a tool).  The official achievements can be done quickly. Nothing is rewarding you in the end for defeating evil, fishing for the Inuit, etc... But than you have hidden ones: 1 per relic or beyond object (object disappearing and reappearin)... Not every scene has them and sometimes, a beyond object and a relic can be in the same one.  The graphics are alright, but the characters are filmed actors. I would say that it's maybe weird to see them like that in a drawn scene. While it's maybe a nice intention, I didn't find that so... well-executed. The actors are correct, it's not that but how it was integrated.... during these scenes, I had pixels around....  The little nice add is to find coins to buy the pingoo a pool, a tv, a basket-ball. It's making me smile and while it's not very developed, it's still a little feature that is appreciated.  The soundtrack is alright too.  So, while I'm feeling perhaps mixed for this game, I'll still recommend to grab it with a nice discount. It's enjoyable, with 'easy' achievements for those who loves 100%.",
