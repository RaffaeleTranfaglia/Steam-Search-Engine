The Binding of Isaac is a very fun game for me and I love it's art style. That being said here are some pros and cons:  Pros: 1. Precise gameplay (in terms of movement, shooting and the bullet hell aspects.) 2. Wide variety of bosses 3. Randomized everything! 4. Great soundtrack! 5. Wide variety of characters 6. (With Afterbirth) Interesting greed mode with cool final boss 7. Great community!  Cons: 1. Very hard to memorize what _____ Item does. (maybe its just me, idk) 2. Ouch! Alot of bullet hell aspects. (Im bad at those)  Anyway, the cons are pretty much because those are my personal issues with it. Believe me, if you want replayability and a good game to stream/ play through blind then this is it!",

            "review_text": "The original Binding of Isaac was released back in 2011 and was pretty much the effort of two or three people, the game on a chronically horrible Flash interface. The original is still pretty great.  However, comparing the original and the remastered Binding of Isaac is like the difference between a regular membrane keyboard and a mechanical keyboard. You won't notice the difference immediately, but it will stick in your mind if you go back to the original.   Rebirth plays much better in comparison via subtle changes to the formula. The main differences between the original and the remastered edition include 160+ new items, native gamepad support (thank jebus), a new set of gameplay and difficulty tweaks (Hard mode being a big tweak for cool kids who like to unlock more things on top of their already unlocked things), and the game engine running at 60FPS all times every times (except when you alt-tab to something else, I've noticed, but I'm not going to hit the developers for that).  It's a worthy addition to a classic, and I don't know if I can go back to playing the original now, since this supercedes it by a mile. Honestly, the only people I imagine who would complain about this are frustrated teenagers who don't get allowances and those awful pedantic ♥♥♥♥s on Steam who use the forums to complain about refunds every time the pre-orders don't get released on time.",

The main character, Captain Soap Price, callsign Isaac, is on a mission to tackle the deep-rooted fears that all humans have of ungodly things such as poop and basements. Taking a bold step away from a tried and true formula, CoD:BW is no longer a first person shooter. Players do not play as a badass soldier anymore either. In order to connect with the fanbase on a more personal level, the head of Nintendo decided that CoD:BW would place players in the shoes of the average Call of Duty player: a naked child who hates their mother (but ♥♥♥♥s mine all the time apparently).  However, what is most surprising about this CoD is the lovely message that the campaign has. By tackling his fears head on, he dies, meaning he can't be afraid anymore.That's some A+ Ernest Hemingway ♥♥♥♥ right there folks. Thanks to Isaac being a mix of Wolverine and Dr. Evil, however, he can try to kill his mother over and over until he succeeds and gets her to listen to his mixtape. This has the not-so-unexpected result of killing his mom again. Seriously ♥♥♥♥ off with your mixtapes. As you can tell by the pros and cons that I've listed above, this game should be GOTY 2015-2020.  Remember kids, if you throw poop and shoot eyeball sperm at your own mother the Devil spits in God's face.",

How he had to abandon all hope and crawl into the deep depths of his own basement to escape the wrath of his birth-giver, the one that was supposed to love him.   How would you feel? If your mother began to ♥♥♥♥ fury on everything you ever cared about, and your last hope was to run, the tears slowly rolling down your face as you try to survive. Survive and be able to live the next day. Just to repeat the inevitable heat death of the universe from your own mother's hands. It's absolutely heart-wrenching.   The story is similar to my life, my father told me he went out for bread and milk on Christmas, but never returned. When I had finally learnt of his whereabouts, I travelled all the way to New Mexico, just in the hopes that he'd remember me. But when I realised that he had three spanish kids and was paying them twenty cents and two coconuts a day to do absolutely everything for him, I was in distraught. I ran away and I never found my way home. But as I was walking along the bustling, urban streets of China Town, I stumbled upon this game, the Binding of Isaac: Rebirth. At first my thoughts of this game were not too high, but as I continued to play I realised how disappointed Isaac must have been in not just his own life, but also his mother.   I continued to play this game to the point where I'm not able to without tearing up from the wonderful love triangle beheld upon me, and any player.   10/10: Plot Twist - The voice of god speaking to Isaac's mother was my dad.",

It is absolutely brilliant. At first, I thought Danny B's soundtrack can never be topped, but this, it just breaks the world, that's how good it is. No offense, Mr. Baranowsky, but this soundtrack is amazing.  But the game is not all about the soundtrack, but there's a lot more.  Comparing this game to the original, it provides a shining new difficulty for me, quite like when I first played the original game. Not only is this game so familiar, it's so distanced from me that it just blows my mind. It gives a perfect feeling of excitement that takes me to the time I first got the original. Simply amazing. The gameplay hasn't changed too much, but there are tons of new things in this game, including items and mobs, as well as all the secrets I find in every corner. This game is the remake of the game I've played 110+ hours for, and it is jam-packed with basically twice as much as the original game has to offer. Everything is confusing, but it's all in the best way possible.  The reason this game has so much charm is to older players who have a newfound feeling of excitement and curiosity when they play this game. Simply beautiful.  To the actual game, the story is as is, but there's more to it in this version. That will remain a mystery until the first person reaches that level! The cutscenes are fantastic.  The gameplay, as said before, is, in my opinion, more difficult than original Isaac. It's unbelievably smooth, which is unlike the original. When you're at the final boss, it's actually pressurizing, even if you have an overpowered combination. It continues to irk me the fact that this game can remain so difficult even after I had Brimstone+Polyphemus, which, for newcomers, is a powerful combination.  The graphics are more pixelated, with thinner outlines. This was an unbelievable surprise. I thought I would dislike the graphics, but I can easily get used to this.  The game's engine is one of the hype-raising things. When Ed teased dynamic lasers and brimstone, everyone had already had their life savings on this game, ready to grab it ASAP. None were disappointed.  The final verdict I would like to give this game is a full 10/10. It's absolutely perfect. It truly is. The replay factor is turned up to the maximum, the gameplay is beautiful, and it is an overall beautiful game.",

            "review_text": "Binding of Isaac rebirth review. Pros. The main thing you can say about this game is it has a HUGE amount of content. The game has mod support, it is different each time you play, there are thousands of items, monsters and rooms. The game is very challenging, it takes a while to master the twin stick shooting nature of the game and there are very satisfying boss fights in the game And you can challenge your self by forcing your self to not use a good item or to use a bad item.  The replay value of the game is very very high, even if you complete everything in the game you can still replay the game for more challenge as there are so many variables to a run of the game. The game is easy to mod, check out the binding of Isaac mod website. Cons, the port isn't perfect, it is a much better port than the classic binding of Isaac, controller support is great, refundable keys work well, and this game should run on most computers but it is surprisingly demanding but I have had crashes with the game I have had my keyboard and controller not work with the game randomly and the game can crash. Multiplayer, the game does have Multiplayer it has local Multiplayer if you have a controller to plug into your PC then one person can play on the controller and the other the keyboard or two people on controllers but sadly you can't use system link or online multiplayer and you can't use two keyboards. The game can get repetitive, if you keep playing the game it eventually gets repetitive after a while but unique items are supposed to keep it fresh. But I will say after a few hundred hours the game can start to get old but coop, all the content and collectibles makes makes this hardly a issue.   Thoughts, binding of Isaac is a game that was a flash game but then two versions of the game came out, Binding of Isaac the normal version, it is cheaper than rebirth but has less content it is missing rebirth content and the wrath of the lamb DLC, Then there is the rebirth version that has more content than the first. While the other version of the game is cheaper, it is a worse port having less customization than rebirth does. So if you want to enjoy binding of issac this is the best way to.  To conclude this game is worth your money I would say that the game is worth over 30$ because of all the content and how fun the gameplay is alone. Mod support, how the game already comes with Wrath of the lamb DLC and you can get afterbirth if you enjoy a twinstick like robocop or smash tv i highly recommend it and if you have never played this kind of game I recommend starting out with binding of Isaac And if you want a demo of the game look for the flash version of the game and if you want that but 10 times better get binding of Isaac rebirth.",

Overall, I think this game is a huge improvement compared to the original, and was really worth creating, pretty much every aspect of the game is improved:  - Tthe game looks quite different thanks to a new pixalised art style. Some people will like it, some won't. I do.  - The game is even more full of S.H.I.T. Literally. There's poop everywhere.  - The amount of... pretty much everthing is extended: items, enemies, pickups, characters, challenges, levels, rooms... etc - This title also has a better game engine, I have muuuch less game freezing issue with this one. It crashed once, but hopefuly the new saving system (another great improvement!) let me go back to where I was ! - There is now the possibility of choosing between 2 difficulties.  The only bad thing about that game is that THE ♥♥♥♥ING BLOAT BOSS IS STILL IN THE GAME AND I HATE HIM SO ♥♥♥♥ING MUUUUUUCH.   I think this game is mostly destinated to the fans of the original game, fixing everything that had to be  fixed and improving it in every aspect. Maybe the first one stays a better game if you want to start though, since it is cheaper and less complex.",

            "review_text": "This game is...  Aww, who am I kidding? You already know what this game is. This has been on the top 10 list of most-played Steam games since it came out. Chances are you've already played it for at least 20 hours, watched Youtubers play it, or both. Actually, what are you even doing here? Are you looking at reviews for games you've already played, and already have a strong opinion about, just for a sense of validation? Shame. Shame on you. You're grounded. Go back to the basement.  But for the record, I think this game is absolutely fantastic. Improves on the previous game in pratically every way. It's so great to play Isaac without the Flash lag, and all the new items and secrets are wonderful to discover. If the original Isaac and Wrath of the Lamb were a 9.0, this is a 9.8.  Why not 10? Well, personally, I feel it loses some teeny tiny points for some very minor things:  - The new music. Disagree if you want -- and that's fine, I know a lot of people adore the new music -- but personally, I feel it's just not as good as Danny B's soundtrack. Isaac is a very repetitive game -- It's a game where you fight the same enemies in the same environments dozens of times -- and I feel repetitive games deserve catchy soundtracks. Rebirth's music is not catchy and not memorable, but it's moody, creepy, atmospheric, and sometimes downright innovative, but very much resembles the soundtrack to a horror movie rather than the pulse-pounding action game that this is. It does have much higher production values than the original, and the extra music layer that kicks in during tough rooms is a great touch, but as much as it’s grown on me, I still find myself missing the old soundtrack too much. In fact, I’d probably throw money at a DLC that adds the old music back in some form.  - The sprite graphics. All the sprites in this game are not pixel art -- they're actually still the same old flash vectors, but now they have aliased pixels traced over them, making them look low-res. Just... Why?? Why fix what's not broken? Well, I kind of know the answer. It was Ed McMillen's original vision for the game to have pixel graphics, and he eventually came to loathe even looking at the original graphics because he felt they were rushed. I can respect that. But the original graphics had CHARM, dammit. The enemies were deceptively cute, and it was awesome. I loved looking at them. And besides, I always felt that the Binding of Isaac was the ultimate pinnacle of the gross, gory, shocking, irreverent wave of Flash animations that flooded Newgrounds and the internet in the 00's, and Isaac's vector art fit that role so perfectly. Yeah, I know there's a filter you can turn on, but it makes the graphics even worse. At any rate, the particles, backgrounds, effects, and stunning cutscenes more than make up for it in the graphics department, so I don't complain too loudly.  - The game is very, very, very easy. Though I can't tell how much of that is just my skill after having Platinum God'd the original game. But with all the great new items, it seems that Rebirth is less about skill and more about consistently becoming overpowered, and it gives you ample opportunities to do so. I feel like I can always tell if a run is won or lost by the end of the very first level, whereas in the original Isaac I had to stick around for a while before I could tell if a run had potential, because there weren't enough game breakers that you were likely to find one in the first item room and then a good devil deal to synergize with it. But again, I don't complain loudly because repeatedly becoming a god -- especially a different kind of god each time -- is a blast, so maybe this was the direction the game should have taken in the end.  After a few arguable nitpicks, this is still nearly a 10/10 game in my book. But there’s no need to listen to me! Isaac is so ubiquitous now that you either already own it, or know whether or not you want it. Again, why are you even reading reviews? Back to the basement with you!",

I have unlocked every item and am real platinum God, as are many others that have played this game nonstop until their thumbs bled. It's a game you keep saying 'ok, just one more run..' and before you know it 6 hours have gone by. With a twisted plot and dark art style, this game isn't for everyone, but damn if it isn't one of the best games I've ever played. Much more polished than the original, with more characters, items, bosses, and other content, you are guaranteed to get your money's worth. I absolutely love this game (as well as afterbirth), and the only negative thing I have to say is when the game first released there were some bugs with achievements, but they have been worked out now.  I give this game 10/10 pants",

            "review_text": "Just to get this across, this review will be more for those who have played the previous game, in assuming you have played or at least saw a little bit of the previous game.  I usually steer away from remakes, as they don't normally add anything NEW to the game, and what little 'graphical changes' that are done are barely noticable.  This is NOT the case with Binding of Isaac: Rebirth.  Binding of Isaac was a great, rogue-like indie game, with plenty of items and a few interesting combos that you could pull off. I believe I have ~24 hours in that game. When Wrath of the Lamb came out, it made it all the better, new items, challenges, etc. It was nothing short of a wonderful experience hard to find elsewhere.  Rebirth, on the otherhand, is a masterpiece. To begin with, the new graphic style that has been added in is beautiful! I love the slightly pixelated style that comes along with it. If you don't, and prefer the old style, no problem: there is an option to revert back to that. Rebirth adds countless new rooms to explore, making each run truely feel new and fresh, where the previous would feel quite similar after just a few. There are a rediculous amount of items in Rebirth, both new and old. Although the majority of the items ARE from the previous, the combos you can pull off now are completely new, and make the items have a new refreshing feel to them. Nearly every item can combo in some way or another with others, creating some incredibly (OP) hilarious effects. If you happen to be looking for new bosses, they've got that too, as well as the old and memerable ones from before. (I am talking about you Monstro you cute little abomination!)  Alright, I think that about concludes that. I don't believe I have missed anything too terribly. Really, if you enjoyed the previous game, get this. Don't even hesitate. It's an amazing upgrade, and with planned future DLC, I am sure it is going to get even better. If you haven't played the previous, all I can say, is if you enjoy roguelike games, then you are looking at one of the BEST ones you can find out there.  TLDR: First game that motivated me to aim for completing ALL the achievements. Get this game if you like roguelike games, as it is a masterpiece. ",

            "review_text": "As someone that completed this game (yes that is bragging, no I dont feel shame), I think this game is pretty good but i am also able to give a list of the good and bad things that the game trows at you. the good: 1. an endless amount of weird sentences to describe your feelings about the items -yay i have cancer -my god doing number 1 and 2 in your mothers stomach is not good for the evil that lives there. -soy milk sucks(not only in game) -thank god I found 3 items of my death cat so i can shoot flies/ 2. A random generated game that can keep you entertained for hours. 3. gameplay is fair in 98% percent of all situations. 4. a lot of variations in the items you can pick up. 5. A lot of variations in the bosses. 6. some of the best final bosses ever created. 7. After more then 600 hours i still find unkown rooms every now and then. 8. A huge community of players willing to make wiki's and entertaining content for you. 9. Gameplay is fun and addicting. 10. good runs feel amazing The bad 1: some of the bosses/rooms can be unfair with certain builds. 2. despite the huge variation of items, there are a lot of items that just do the same thing. 3. some descriptions of items are vague which forces you to look up information on the wiki.(for example guppy's tail says you are cursed, which means you have more chance of dropping chest at then end of a room). 4. some bosses fall outside of the difficulty curve(the wretched is way to easy, the haunt way to difficult etc). 5. 2 bosses are blatantly unfair(daddy longlegs and mammy gurdy can randomly damage you). 6. 2 of the characters after the expansion are incredebly annoying/unfun to complete. 7. the expansion made the game way more difficult so it is hard for new players to get into this new gamplay without playing the non expansion first(not really bad, but useful to know). 8: bad runs can be frustrating  overal I think this game is probably one of the best roguelike games I ever played and i think it is worth picking this game up if you like this kind of gameplay.

            "review_text": "The premise of this game is that you are a naked little boy whose mother is a crazy Christian fundamentalist that is hopefully not a Catholic. You must navigate your basement and kill aborted fetuses, babies in general, and occassional abominations using your tears. Most of these abortions were not born yesterday, so you must adapt different tactics and strategies and use every tool at your disposal to beat them. These tools include bombs, universal keys, and loose change. You quite literally need to sift through poop to find pennies, therefore players of Jewish ethical descent may find this game enjoyable. You must eventually find your mother and murder her, alongside Satan, yourself, an undead version of yourself, yourself again, and your undead self once again, amongst others.  Christian fundamentalists or religious extremists may find this game to be offensive. This game is more offensive than that time I locked myself out of my car at an abortion clinic and they gave me a dirty look when I asked them for a coat hanger after making a miscarriage joke. When playing, you have a variety of multitasking at hand regarding combat and conserving resources. You must become as adept at multitasking as Helen Keller is at playing the piano with one hand and singing with the other. This game has many features similar to the classic dungeon crawling Zelda games like its predecessor, but with more content and a theme revolving around a Pro-Life nightmare or on the contrary a Pro-Choice wet dream.  Issac, the protagonist, is also a transexual crossdresser. This allows him to take on a variety of personalities that are in the form of unlockable characters, each with their own special multiple-personality disorder themed unique abilities. Alongside this, the game offers a variety of unlockable content in the form of new items, levels, and more. Multiple endings are available that seem to hide a plot of some sort, which may or may not include issac being molested by the pope after murdering his mother with the special guest appearences of Lucifer, Muhummad, and Richard Dawkins.  If you're a fan of mildy offensive high quality dungeon crawling roguelikes with alot of replayibility, I would recommend this game. However, in its current state it is plagued with some bugs and compatibility issues, slightly reducing its score.  I give it 9/11 stars, would offend again.",

The Binding of Isaac Rebirth is essentially a reboot of Isaac Classic, a rogue 2D action RPG shooter, with new enemies, bosses, items, item synergies, floors, and rooms. I've always found that this game expertly balances punishment and reward, as the items you get and the floors you must fight through are randomly generated. Playing skillfully and weighing your options on a floor (i.e. whether to expend bombs or keys to possibly get items) are also crucial, allowing you to control your fate in BoI to some degree. You will have runs that are nearly impossible to beat. You will have runs that will be over on the 2nd floor because of some ridiculously overpowered item/item synergy. You will have runs where you are BARELY powerful enough to beat the game, in which you can pat yourself on the back for playing tactically. Through a mixture of success and failure you will find a drive to continue playing. Games that evoke such a drive are few and far between.  9.5/10",

CONS:   I felt very overpowered from the start even to the end, and only the end boss, 'mom,' is hard to fight and win, while all other rooms and bosses are easy to battle  so from that I would say the game is very amazing, very well done, and I would deeply recomend buying and playing it untill you run out of arcade tokens.

The game is very similar to Zelda 1, where the player tranverses dungeons, killing enemies (with his own tears. I'll get there) and destroying bosses and going deeper and deeper into the sanity of Isaac. The game is very famous for it's controversial story, taking a stab at religious groups.  In the story, Isaac is a little boy who lives with his christian mom, until the mom hears a voice from above, which she assumes is her God, and the voice asks for her to cleanse his son, by taking everything that is fun in his life, such as his toys, drawings and his clothes. The voice isn't satisfied yet, so it demands a sacrifice of Isaac (much like the biblical story), but Isaac manages to escape her psycho mom by going down a trapdoor hidden on a carpet, and going down to unknown depths below, eventually being powerful enough to face her mom again.  The gameplay consists of Isaac killing monsters at his basement with his own tears (because he's sad that his mom left him), dodging enemy bullets, going to item rooms to get items and be more powerful and killing the boss of the floor to get deeper. After certain conditions are met, you get to do a Deal with the Devil, where you trade your health containers (you can get them from HP ups) for usually damage items, with some exceptions. Most of the floors contains a item room and a shop where you can spend money for other resources and items.  Isaac collects pennies, keys, bombs, pills, tarot cards, runes and trinkets (they work like temporary items). Pennies can be used to play on slot machines and buy items on the shop, bombs can be used to make pathways or combat, and keys open locked chests and locked doors. Pills, tarot cards and runes stay on a slot until you use them, and each one of them has a different effect, like teleportation, or a stat up.  Rebirth is a classic rogue-like, and definately worth your money. Most of the complaints are of it's luck based runs, but with enough practice, you can beat the game without many items. And all the runs have a way to turn overpowered, just need to learn and make good decisions.   10/10.001 ",

Isaac is isolated and his play-things are taken away.

When all seems lost, isaac finds a hidden access to a basement. Not knowing what he faces, he jumps down.  Binding of Isaac is prehaps the best rouge-like on the steam service. Smooth gameplay even on the minium required computer specs. A variety of characters and loads of items even in the vanilla game,, the randomness of everything makes for a high replay value- personally I have clocked well over 300hrs on it across systems (ps-vita and xbox).  Plus sides:  -high replayablilty -hundreds of items to use across a variety of charaters with unique abilities and start- from isaac the the blood-beam blasting power of the devils son -Fancy a challenge? try some of the themed challenges -awesome bosses- from the 4 horsemen, to a giant sentient.... flesh pile? -no tutorials- learn it your self -brilliant controler support (I would recomend it)  Down sides:  -some runs of the game can be unforgiving.... but still funs so... not really a downside ",

Unlike other roguelikes Isaac can let you do a whole lot more from beating the game normaly to getting The Real Platinum God achievement to just having fun trying to break the game, this holds a great variety that a lot of players can enjoy. The music is way more diffrent then in vanilla Isaac with a bunch of diffrent songs for every area your in wether it be your basement or a cave system or even a dungeon you'll really feel like you're there. The graphics got a HUGE facelift from the original as it now uses a more 16-bit approach as aposed to a more drawing look, and because of that look great.

The gameplay consists of Isaac killing monsters at his basement with his own tears (because he's sad that his mom left him), dodging enemy bullets, going to item rooms to get items and be more powerful and killing the boss of the floor to get deeper. After certain conditions are met, you get to do a Deal with the Devil, where you trade your health containers (you can get them from HP ups) for usually damage items, with some exceptions. Most of the floors contains a item room and a shop where you can spend money for other resources and items.  Isaac collects pennies, keys, bombs, pills, tarot cards, runes and trinkets (they work like temporary items). Pennies can be used to play on slot machines and buy items on the shop, bombs can be used to make pathways or combat, and keys open locked chests and locked doors. Pills, tarot cards and runes stay on a slot until you use them, and each one of them has a different effect, like teleportation, or a stat up.  Rebirth is a classic rogue-like, and definately worth your money. Most of the complaints are of it's luck based runs, but with enough practice, you can beat the game without many items. And all the runs have a way to turn overpowered, just need to learn and make good decisions.   10/10.001 ",

It's got a definite learning curve, but you also get rewards that are worth it in the long run (unless it's Cain's unlocks, which are garbage).   My advice, though, is if you're looking to get Rebirth, just go with Rebirth in the beginning. No sense in buying the DLC as well if you end up not liking it. That's like going to the store and buying kale in bulk if you've only ever had spinach and decided that 'they are kind of similar and I might enjoy it'.  Anyway, I adore this game. McMillen has made something absolutely wonderful here. Seriously, 10/10.",

The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, and Afterbirth, are a fantastic concoction of fun. You got a wide variety of enemies, bosses, playable characters, rooms as well as the most important part of the games: Items, some good and some absolutely terrible. Luck is a very important factor in this game, you might get the worst items with the easiest bosses, or you might get to fight the Haunt on your first floor ffs Edmund please nerf the Haunt PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD ALMIGHTY (while you are at it, nerf Ragman's spiders too, they have too much health).  You play as Isaac, who is forced down a trapdoor in his room when his Christian mother hears a voice from above telling her to kill her son because he is corrupted by sin. And in the basement he finds all kinds of spooky scary things such as flies... or spiders... or maybe a headless body walking around spraying blood everywhere. Your goal? Kill your mother, before she, or everything else in the basement, kills you. You start out with nothing, but as you progress you will unlock more and more items, bosses, floors and challenges that expand the game greatly to make it worth playing for more than just a couple of hours. You can also co-op with your friends, test your skill against the leaderboard or try out Afterbirths' Greed Mode, which throws you into the same scenario except you must now kill a huge money spewing Jew with a noose around his neck. The game is extremely fun, and I recommend you get it sooner than later, you won't regret it.   The soundtrack is fantastic as well, throw that in with your purchase, and cross your fingers and hope that Afterbirth+ comes out this Christmas...",

There's always something more to unlock, another challenge to attempt, a new and bizarre combination of items to discover. For even more variety, there's a  library of mods  [moddingofisaac.com]  to check out.  I guess there was some kind of furor over the release of the Afterbirth DLC, but as someone who wasn't in the thick of it, I don't see any reason not to recommend it. Greed Mode offers a compact challenge with a number of new unlocks associated. Daily challenges are a ton of fun, especially if you buddy up with someone on  Greedbutt  [greedbutt.com]  to compare scores with. The new characters play very differently from anything that's come before. And while there's not anything particularly notable about the new monsters and rooms, they pad out the roster enough to freshen things up if you've been playing a while. It's not a must-have DLC, but if you play Rebirth and enjoy it, it's a worthy addition.",

CONS:  -if you dont have a controller you are pretty much screwed ( its almost immposible to play with the keyboard...well...at least from my experience );  -luck, luck and more luck are neccesary to beat the game. Because of its random levels and random item generation, some levels are really hard to beat ( no good power ups in golden rooms, no heart drops, the reward of the beaten boss is poopy, etc. ).  BUT, the game is still really enjoyable even with these couple of cons and sometimes they arent even noticable.   My rating on this game is a 9/10 because of its randmoness, challanges and cutenes. This is one of the rare games that made me feel good when i defeated a boss. Thank you developers. ",

            "review_text": "An incredibly fun mixture of Roguelikes and NES Zelda, with a touch of Bullet Hell Shooter for good measure, but it's ultimately marred by rather hamfisted RNG reliance and repulsive visual themes.  First off, this game is really, really fun. It's easy to sink hours into, and each run feels very different. It's also a significant upgrade from the original version, adding lots of new rooms, items, bosses, and most importantly running at a higher framerate which makes all the action much smoother. Even if you own the original this is a great purchase.  That said, a large portion of the fun comes from the random item drops and the synergies between them over the course of a game, whether it's obscenely powerful like an item that replaces your default attack with bombs combined with an item that makes explosions heal you, or fun but impractical, like an item that causes you to shoot dozens of projectiles a second for almost no damage, and various items that randomly cause your attacks to stun, poison, charm or explode enemies. In fact there's a series of challenge runs based specifically on the impractical combos. Unfortunately while runs with great synergy are incredibly fun, the majority of your gameplay will wind up with you getting very boring items or ones that don't work well together at all, like an item that gives you a damage boost at low health followed by a series of max health upgrades. As you start trying harder modes and characters you'll find yourself more and more tempted to reset repeatedly in an effort to have at least the first few items be powerful ones, and that's no fun for anyone. To the game's credit it's completely possible to beat the game with no items whatsoever (this is in fact another challenge), but again it's significantly less fun than finding a really great combo and putting that to use.  And then there are the visuals. The graphics look very nice, and the theming is very solid and cohesive, but unfortunately it's just extremely gross to a point where I think it's honestly a detriment to the game. I've heard it very aptly described as 'body horror'. You play as a naked baby wandering through a maze crying at things to damage them, and your enemies mostly consist of maggots, flies, deformed 'human-esque' enemies, living poop, and so on. The upgrades are along the same lines, you collect things like diseases, implements of torture, and even a coat hangar (a joke in particularly poor taste). It actually poses an interesting case study of both 'graphics vs gameplay', as well as 'graphics vs visual themes'. The gameplay and graphics from an objective view are great, it's the visual themes that will turn people away.  Lastly, a lot of people like to talk about the religious theming of the game. The creator has mentioned that he doesn't intend the game as 'anti-religion', and I honestly believe him. I don't see anything particularly anti-religion about the game, it's simply used as a framing device (based heavily on the biblical story 'The Binding of Isaac'). There are religiously themed items and enemies, but again they tend to be quite neutral in their use, angels and devils representing good and evil, crosses granting protection, Lazarus' Rags are available as an item which will resurrect you, an obvious reference to another biblical story. The 'body horror' themes tend to put you in the mindset of thinking the game is painting religion in a negative light, but I think that it's merely present, not being commented upon in any meaningful way. Isaac's Mother is the villain and is depicted as watching religious TV programs and ultimately hearing the voice of God telling her to kill Isaac, but this feels to me much more like she is simply delusional and crazed for reasons other than religion, and this is hinted at by the story as you analyze the endings.",

Sometimes you'll have an annoying run, and youll take a 10 minute break before you realize how fun another run sounds.   The RNG is a little much with over 450 items in the game. But there is certainly skill involved as well, so you can only blame the RNG gods so much for any given run.   There are so many different ways to enjoy this game, not only are there hundreds of items, but there are over half a dozen characters to play, dozens of enemies to fight, maybe 2 dozenish bosses, a number of different rooms, interesting engaging mechanics like secret rooms or rocks with items in them that make overlooking them one of the factors that can make the difference between a bad and a good run.   Resource mangagment is also a fun way of making sure your runs are optimal; learning how to effeciently save your coins, keys, or bombs for any particular encounter is what makes you a better player.  Despite the RNG giving you a 'meh' run sometimes, you only have yourself to blame in some runs, What i really love about this game is learning how to play each run to its advantages and how to in turn play around its weaknesses.

Azazel is definitely my go-to when I've had a long, exhausting day and just want to see how crazy powerful I can get.  But as in the original, it's really the items that shine. With a ton added and some old favorites updated, it will take most players a fair amount of time to collect them all, and potentially an infinite amount of time to see all the cool synergies. Way more items seem to affect one another and it's rare I've had a run that was absolutely ruined because one item just overwrote another.  I haven't played much hard mode because it really doesn't align too much with the things I find fun about this game, though I will say the recent update fixed the main issue I had with it, which was a complete and utter lack of consumables (keys, bombs) dropping. Be advised though, hitting down or S on the character select screen will pop you into Hard Mode. Don't do what I did and play in that mode for 5 runs, wondering why you're suddenly sucking so bad, before you realize. :D  Overall, I highly recommend this game. It's a no-brainer for fans of the original, and if you like rogue-lites, it's an awesome edition. One of my favorites. Even with a very limited gaming schedule and more games to play than I have time, I've played BoI: Rebirth for at least an hour every day since I bought it.",

As such, whether you should buy this title or not depends on how much you liked or disliked the original game and therefore you should really check its reviews before getting Rebirth.  This version of the Binding of Isaac acts both as an expansion and a major tweak over the original game. The title is no longer flash-based, allowing you to save your progress without needing to clear the game in one sitting: you are also given three save files should you desire to start over.  The graphical overhaul provides the game with a pixel art look, which can be tuned down a bit (but only a bit) in the options. The characters and the effects are noticeably smoother and various floors now allow for bigger rooms to appear from time to time. The music is also vastly different (due to a change in the composer).  Gameplay-wise, Rebirth adds some new characters (among which Azazel is particularly noticeable for being a bit too overpowered, as the time of this review), items, room, bosses, an extra level and two final bosses. While the stream of new features is most welcome, some of the later new content (such as the new bosses) is not easy to unlock and may require a bit of a guide to help you out. It's also worth mentioning that the overall difficulty of the game increased by a good measure (some new achievements are a nightmare to obtain, a pair of old bosses have recived a significan overhaul and some of the new enemies are downright nasty).  All in all, The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is great updated version of the original Isaac and should be the only Isaac game you should need in a very long time",

So for those that aren't familiar with the franchise, The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is a roguelike, dungeon crawler twin stick shooter based on the biblical story about Abraham and Isaac(Wich is why there's alot of biblical references in the shape of both items and bosses) where you play as Isaac and in this case it's your mother that's got the message to sacrifice you. You'll be fighting your way through abominations, lost siblings and literally poop in the hunt for different items to aid you in the final confrontation with your mother. And as you play and beat the game you'll unlock more and more items, bosses and even different characters.  And the 'Cartoony' art style really does a great job on making you forget the fact that you're actually running around naked in the basement, crying on all sorts of foul creatures while using all sorts of harmful things on yourself to make you cry even more while being hunted by your own mother. :3  So yes, if you like games with incredible replay-value then The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is right up your ally! 10/10",

For those that found the original too easy, don't worry - there is a hard mode which (I assume) is harder than the original game's default difficulty.  I haven't played the original much. I mainly bought this version because it has analog controller support. In the original, I was able to use an external program (xpadder) to bind the keys to my controller, but having the main weapon bound to the right analog stick didn't work well. With Rebirth, binding the main weapon to the right analog stick works better.   I think Rebirth also runs better on my PC, but I haven't played long enough to say for sure. I also like the OST better in the original, but I haven't played long enough to say for sure about this either.",

It's a small pickup game that you can almost play anywhere, and it just so addicting. Only downsides are:  1. it's perma-death (don't want anybody to rage quit, although I don't care myself) 2. it's a little dark (but the graphics are so pixelated it doesn't matter)   And the price... c'mon, what else are you gonna do with $15? Buy a sandwch and a drink, or have endless hours of arcade gaming? But really, who cares. It's a great game, so just get it.  ",

One of the best parts of the game is that over time you will unlock new upgrades, new bosses, and new areas that you can access which keeps it very replayable. The coop in Rebirth is great too, but unfortunately it's not viable as certain characters.  I recommend unlocking all of the characters as quickly as you can. Some are definitely better than others.

I can maneuver way better than I could in the first one. The pixelated graphics and 60fps make the game responsive in ways the first one couldn't have dreamed of. The game feels really fleshed out and has a lot more personality. There's more items, more enemies, more everything. The redone soundtrack does a lot to fit the dark atmosphere of the game. There's a timer to keep the speedrunning nerds happy.  Oh, and it's harder.  If I had one complaint, it's not about the things that have been revamped. It's the couch co-op mode. I mean, yeah, that's to be expected with a game like this. I imagine Edmund wanted to make a game that he and his wife could play together. But there should be an online co-op mode as well.

There's a wealth of new items/powerups, as well as many of the old favorites, and the fun of finding out exactly what some of these things do is back!   The soundtrack is to die for: listen to it with some good headphones and you'll see just how well-produced Ridiculon's tracks came out, more of an immersive atmosphere than Baranowsky's sweeping piano riffs (also an excellent OST in its own right).

All the time while I'm playing I'm trying to dislike this game because it's very different from the original but I just can't because I'm just having so much damn fun XD The fact that it got controller support now is really great, I'm a pc gamer but it's just really nice to have that option when you can just layback and play the game in a very relaxed position, and the controls are very good on there too! The visuals, even if I think I would've liked something else than the pixels, are really freaking great, they're darker, they're more fluid, they're simply better. The soundtrack is just gorgeous. In the last one it felt kind of like an old style gothic game but now it's just really moody and dark but style got that great humorous feel. The athmosphere is simply amazing. It upped the darkness but still upped the humor, I don't know how they did it but it's just freaking great. The bigger rooms and different environments are really nice and allow for a different playstyle and different ennemies once in a while while keeping the original feel. Sometimes, in the big rooms, it almost felt like I was playing Diablo 2 XD. It's really amazing. The game is all around awesome, just buy it XD you won't regret it.",

This game would sure be on a top 10 list for my favorites games and it all started with a little flash game, so yeah you should buy this game whenever you can!

Okay so I've spent quite a bit of time on this game so let me tell you a bit about it.  TBoI is a rougelike game where you control young Isaac, a boy going through an understandably hard time due to his mother and everything else wanting him dead. Throughout the game you venture deeper and deeper into the catacombs of your basement, even venturing so far as your own mother's womb, and along the way you fight rooms of baddies grab items to help you on your way and fight a boss or two here and there.  The gameplay is what really sells this game the most. You use WASD to control where you go and use the arrow keys to fire your tears at enemies. Throughout the dungeons you find different pick-ups to aid you including permanent items, not so permanent items, and things like playing cards or runes that offer temporary help. The permanent items can be a bit hit or miss at times. One changes your tears into a laser beam with unlimited range and might was well rename the game to Slapping Isaac's Wrist, then there are some that do jack like one that gives you a temporary heart and makes you smaller.  It's also kinda bad at explaining some things to you. A lot of the items you only discover their use through trial and error, and some just seem to do *bleep* all. This is compensated though by the fact that you will play through this game over and over again before you even beat it one time. The game lives and dies on the random number generator so some playthroughs will feel like a breeze while others feel like trying to destroy a speeding car by using your body. It gives the game an interesting feel as you pick up new items to add to your arsenal and die repeatedly.  There are also several different characters to choose from, and each of them has different play styles based on different starting items and stats. Some are a little overpowered though like one that starts off with the ability to fly and shoot what I assume is the wraith of Satan himself, but again only through repeated playthroughs will you actually be able to use him right. The game has this sort of fun flowing through the whole thing making it a joy to play without being unchallenging.  And speaking of the bosses in this game can just die. Most of them are almost impossible to beat unless you've memorized their patterns fairly well cause some of them will pull moves out of their butt that will make you say naughty words. One particular boss like this is the Bloat who has two floating eyeballs that damage you if you come in contact, but also a high powered laser that he can fire in just about all the directions. Needless to say I was unhappy with that one.  Overall though I highly recommend this game for it's fun gameplay. The store is basically background noise and is just there to connect the gameplay together. It's one of those games you can play over and over again and can still surprise you. If you want play a good game I suggest you look no further.",

            "review_text": "The Binding of Isaac Rebirth is a rouge-lite twin stick shooter set in Isaac’s cellar. After hearing the “voice of god” telling her to sacrifice her child she promptly agrees and grabs a nearby kitchen knife. To Isaac’s luck he has seen the whole thing from the door's keyhole and while searching for a place to hide, finds the cellar. This is where we start the game, armed with nothing but your tears to stave off the unholy creatures inhabiting the place you assumed safe. Why your tears damage the creatures is a mystery but luckily for Isaac he will never stop crying, meaning you have infinite projectile ammo.  You will travel across a labyrinth of interconnected rooms, until you find a boss room that allows you to progress deeper into the cellar. What makes this game addicting is that the rooms, items and situations will be randomized each play-through so it keeps the game exciting as well as unpredictable. Scattered thorough the areas are keys, bombs and money. Keys allow you to unlock doors and treasure chests which may contain something very good or something that may spell your doom. Bombs are both a great form to attack clusters of creatures and an essential tool to reaching areas out of your reach or discovering secret rooms. Finally, we have money we can use to buy items from dead babies or simply try our luck with the inexplicable slot machines found throughout.  These three items all make a unique ecosystem where each may be necessary to the other such as having all the money in the world but no key to unlock the shop. There are some minor passive items to be found that boost your speed or randomly summons Isaac’s mom to stomp on the battlefield. The most important of items will be locked behind golden doors that contain stuff that can allow you to fly, changes your tears substantially such as changing them to lasers or giving you an ally to help you on your journey to name a few. On top of this Isaac has basic stats such as health, range, luck, damage and a few others that can be increased by items. The search of the loot is a great deal of fun and with so much to be randomized it can quickly become an addiction to keep playing and seeing what insane item combos will happen next time you play.  Even the gameplay can change on a whim for better or worse depending on the situation. You usually can only shoot up or down, left or right but some items will allow you to aim your tears giving you the ability to shoot diagonally or making your tears giant but shortens their range by a ton. One has to adapt to a different way of handling situations constantly and with the game's lack of clear descriptions for nearly anything keeps you alert at all times. This same randomness can lead to annoying situations such as dishing out so little damage that it feels like an eternity to take down a boss or a play-through with little resources. There is a steady flow of unlocks such as items, whole new areas or additional characters to play as that keep you motivated throughout.  Most characters play mostly the same but have different stats or starting items while a few such as Azazel do change how you play. Every character has their own requirements for unlocking like going through a few floors without picking up hearts (health) and another just by having a ton of money. Each have their own quirks and upsides though Isaac will never become obsolete. The creatures you will find throughout this disturbing trek through your cellar range from living poop to Satan himself. There are a ton of different foes you will have to face and most are really disturbing. Hanged babies, fetuses and monstrous lumps of flesh are all common sight here so definitely not a title for the squeamish. Bosses will be your biggest threats and each one is very different from the other, requiring different strategies to taking it down with as few injuries as possible.  That is easier said than done. Everything from the environments to weakest of creatures want you dead. Some room combinations and enemy placement can be quite the hassle to deal with without taking damage and on top of that they may have traps. Once you step in a room the doors will close and lock behind you until either you or they all perish unless you want/need to waste a bomb to blow the door open and escape. If you are lucky the boss room will be on the path you are heading or you will have to once again enter that room which now has the door fully repaired. It is a tough and punishing game that without a doubt strikes a perfect mix of cruelty and reward to keep you coming back.  If you want even more challenge you can turn the difficulty up to hard upon starting a game or you can take one of various Challenges that handicap you in a certain way. There are several endings to unlock depending on who was the final boss that appeared for you. Doing certain things can trigger a chance of facing different bosses and like nearly everything else in this title, it will not be explained on what you need to do. Once you lose all hearts it is game over (unless you have certain items) and you will have the choice to instantly restart for another round or quit. Health can normally only be recovered by collecting hearts that may or may not spawn much that play-through so getting hit even infrequently can slowly lead to your downfall.  Rebirth is a remake of the original Binding of Isaac so for those wondering what is new to this updated version and if it is worth it, I can quite easily say it definitely is. New foes/items, different artstyle, controller support, 60fps, larger rooms and a new soundtrack will get you hooked once again. There is an option to smooth out the new artstyle to make it look more like it's previous Flash style. The soundtrack can be hit or miss depending on your tastes. While the original had cheerful and catchy tunes to contrast the dark theme, Rebirth has a dark and grim soundtrack to amplify how disturbing it is.  There is little story to speak of and the endings are very short &amp; cryptic causing many to interpret different versions of what they might mean. Many claim there is actual meaning to them and there is an overall story but it really isn't the type of game that needs a well told narrative to enjoy. What I can tell you is that it is extremely weird and disturbing. How the developers came up with the insanity found in this game I will never know. Just trying to explain the setting and point of the game to other people will likely have them staying far, far away from you. Yet with its weirdness is born a unique experience that can and will likely addict those who take on the grand task of killing Isaac’s mom. If you ever wanted a game that you can gladly play for the rest of your life, look no further.",

Binding of Isaac is an extremely challenging game, you will find yourself frustrated and often, wanting to quit the game, but you won't. Trust me, although frustrating this game is hell a lot of fun.  Binding of Isaac delivers dark humour and I find myself amused and chuckling at them. The games has randomized dungeon and the controls are easy to learn. On some runs you would find yourself having some godly item on just the first level and crap on others. That's the beauty of this game.  There are bosses at the end of every level, some are easy but most are challenging, there are also mini bosses which have their own very unique mechanics. The difficulty of the levels starts to pick up at level 3, and you would find yourself on the very edge of your seat, dodging bullets and monsters.  So finally to my conclusion. Would I recommend this game? Yes, I would highly recommend it. I mean, it's already an awesome game but since it has such a huge replayability it makes the game even better. What's even better is that The Binding of Isaac is recommended by eight out of ten child psychiatrists.",

It is a particular game and a particular type of game, the graphic of this game is 'updated' by the first title.  Duration: It's not great, It's not short, It's enormous. I think that if you don't reach at least like one hundred hours in this game, you can't say that you finished the game... for how much you've played it.  Conditions of the game: Incredible.

The coolest thing is, that when you find an item and have no clue what it could be and after trying some things out you finally recognize the power of it. For example   MOM´s Knive with Quad-Shot  . Just do it if you get the chance! ---- After playing this game for only 6 hours (only because if you know the first one, you know that 6 hours are nothing in this game), i already know that this is a masterpiece. The Sound is epic and creates the right atmo. The Gamplay is perfect. I control everything with my keyboard and i couldn´t find a lot of issues. Just in a few cases i stopped shooting tears. Maybe it needs a little fix there but nothing dramatic. The Items are awesome. If you wanna see whats possible with the right combo and you can´t wait just play the first few challanges and you get some ideas.  I think that this will be my indi game of the year.   So should you buy it or not?   Well if you can answere the following questions with yes, go and give Edmund McMillen his well deserved money. It isn´t expensive and you get a lot for the money you spend on it.... A lot! We need more of these games.   Did you play the first one and did you enjoy it?   Do you like roguelike games?   Do you like hard games?   Do you like Secrets?   Do you like Zelda (the old 2D ones)?  So now i need to get back to this epic game!",

I'm not yet an expert of game criteria or critique, but it's like zelda if it was less mature and more messed up. But ultimately better in my opinion.  I fell in love with the first binding of isaac because of it's difficulty and it's possibility, and that's why I love it's sequel as well, Rebirth. The game does what the first game set out to do better, and more fully. They have plenty of new items, room layouts, bosses, secrets, etc. etc.  Talking about secrets, I have to quickly mentioned this games developers put in a full fledged puzzle inside their game designed to help the community work together in order to figure it out. I won't spoiler anything, even though everyone knows about the secret by now, but I must give credit to this masterful way in which these developers designed this puzzle. In the game you have plenty of runs in which you die over, and over again. Yet the developers put in items, which when held upon death would unlock a little puzzle piece subtly in the death screen. Over a course a time, dedication, and communication between the community, hundreds of runs from thousands of players would have eventually led to the completetion of the puzzle which would've been a monumentous occasion not only to the delight of the community, but the developers as well I'm sure. Yet due to datamining and just down right scumminess the secret was revealed just as the community was learning how to solve the puzzle. It truly is sad and I agree with what one of the developers said on the matter. 'These data miners ruined something. It's like taking a gourmet steak and eating it whole in one bite.' I just want to apologize to the developers more than anything, cause I for one would've loved to have participated in this little treasure hunt. Love you guys and thanks for making such a cool idea, and sorry it was crushed.  Anyway back to the actualy game now that I'm done with my rant. It plays very similarlily to the first game since I was able to jump into my first run and win the whole thing as if I was a veteran of the game since technically I was with the first game.   If you are a long time fan of the original Binding Of Isaac or just like twin stick shooter, strange, rouge like games then this is right up your alley. Honestly if you are this late to the party you should already know this by now. I'm just writing this review out of respect and love for the game. I can't just pour 500 hours of my life into a franchise and not give back to it like that. Edmund McMuffin, you dun good.",

The game is polished very well, and although people complain about the art style, the 16 bit Isaac looks stunning in the 3D world, and the game runs at a solid 60 fps on most computers due to its optimisation.  Nicalis took a great game plagued by disappointing aspects, and gave it back to us shiny and new, ready for us to finish again and again and again.",

The quantity of items in game is just amazing, ull forget the names of items, ill tell you that. Yes, i dont have that much hours of gameplay but ill promise you wont regret buying this game.

In a separate bowl or jug, lightly whisk together the milk and egg, then whisk in the melted butter. Pour the milk mixture into the flour mixture and, using a fork, beat until you have a smooth batter. Any lumps will soon disappear with a little mixing. Let the batter stand for a few minutes. Heat a non-stick frying pan over a medium heat and add a knob of butter. When it's melted, add a ladle of batter (or two if your frying pan is big enough to cook two pancakes at the same time). It will seem very thick but this is how it should be. Wait until the top of the pancake begins to bubble, then turn it over and cook until both sides are golden brown and the pancake has risen to about 1cm (½in) thick. Repeat until all the batter is used up. You can keep the pancakes warm in a low oven, but they taste best fresh out the pan. Serve with lashings of real maple syrup and extra butter if you like.",

This remake takes the extraordinary level of variety of the original Binding of Isaac to a whole new level, with new bosses, new items, new characters, and countless new rooms, including larger rooms to provide new kinds of challenges. Rebirth also fixes many of the bad 'bugs' from the original game, allowing many items to interact in new and exciting ways (just try Brimstone with Tammy's Head and you'll see what I mean), while retaining some of the 'good bugs,' such as the compass effect occasionally occuring with the Liberty Cap trinket.   The game also introduces several useful features, such as multiple files, which would be nice in a home with multiple users who don't want to share, and the ability to resume the last game, if it was exited through the menu, helping in those cases when you get a good run but don't have the time to finishe immediately. The addition of easily customizable controls also allows you to get a comfortable setup for yourself, and fullscreen mode finally exists! There are also a few other options- notably hitting tab (or whatever you set it to) toggles a larger map with a timer of the current playthrough - but I think these are by far the most worthwhile. There's also a local co-op mode which seems interesting, but I have yet to try it.   And I nearly forgot, the music! Rebirth has a beautiful and fittingly dark soundtrack which well accents the gameplay, with the additional improvement of the music adjusting to the current room - so if the room is slowed or sped up, the music will be as well. If there are a lot of enemies, additional instrumentation may join in. It's a nice touch which gives the game some polish.  In summary, if it's on sale, buy it! If it's not on sale, still buy it unless you think you'll hate it! (In which case I don't know why you're looking at these reviews, but you could try the cheaper original Binding of Isaac to see how it suits you.) It's well worth the investment!",

            "review_text": "The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is a fantastic sequel to a also fantastic game. The meat of this game comes with the huge amount of replayability; unlockable bosses, hundreds of items, many unlockable items and secrets.  Although difficult, The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is a highly recommended rogue-like game. I've hardly seen anybody who doesn't like it, but they exist... They just, hide under a rock or something, I dunno. They're rare, okay?  Anyway, about the reasons this game will earn at least a 8/10 as the final verdict: First off, the enemies.  There are many, many enemies in this game. Some are damn annoying, but even though they're annoying you have to give it to the designers: They're well made and have cool weaknesses to defeat.   Second off: The combat system. At first it seems very basic; you shoot tears in a direction, either up, down, left or right. But actually, as you begin to start getting upgrades, it will change more complicated. Heck, there's one item that makes you shoot SCYTHES instead of tears, how cool is that?  Third off: Replayability. If you want replayability, gosh does this game have it. You will have way over 1000 runs, mostly unique. Also as you play on and defeat bosses, you'll unlock new levels and bosses which then let you unlock more items depending on which character you killed which boss with. For example:  Character A defeats Boss B, Character A unlocks Book of Anguish.  However, when Character B defeats Boss B, Character B unlocks Double Shot instead of Book of Anguish which Character A would have unlocked if they had defeated Boss B instead. See? Two completely different items.  Fourth of all: The smoothness and mobility of this game is amazing. You can map all your controls, there's gamepad support, there's a 'flash filter' and don't quote me on this but seeing as all the teasers Edmund and the crew have been giving out, it may come out on many consoles.  BUT PLEASE TAKE IN NOTE: You cannot use your mouse to shoot tears anymore, which is quite a bummer and is actually a flaw. If this gets fixed and either I notice it or someone tells me, I'll remove this section from the review.  Fifth: It has good graphics. It may look like just a pixel game, which it kind of is, but actually there's a lot of shaders, etc in the game.  Overall this is a great game and has hardly any flaws in my opinion. It's just... Amazing.  The final verdict is a 9/10. Why do I keep reviewing such amazing games? Well, I highly recommed this game. You will love it.",

            "review_text": "Dustforce truly is a work of art. I don't mean that lightly. The way it's animated plus its music gives it that title in my book. I can find myself playing one level for an hour, maybe even hours at a time. The frustration of losing levels is filled with relaxation and calmness because of the ambient music. The way the levels are crafted is truly mindblowing. They had a system in which you had to perfect a level to earn a key, and you would use that key to earn more levels. In layman's terms, to earn more levels, you had to perfect current levels. They ditched that and added an XP system in which you gain more XP to earn a key the more levels you play and perfect. I'm very glad they added this system and was skeptical about buying it. But now that I did buy it, I do not regret it even for a second. One thing I really love about this game is how you don't have to unlock base levels. In a sense, this game is open world. That sense is that many levels are available to you, and you can choose whether you want to advance into more challenging levels, or stay where you're at. To get an S in completion, you have to sweep up EVERY leaf, and to get an S in Finesse, you have to maintain your combo throughout an entire level.   Another thing I absolutely enjoy about Dustforce is its expasive community. There are lots of Community Workshop maps for you to sharpen your skills on, and lots of people who can set a good example. I'm sure most of the people who get best times on all the levels have a Youtube channel, so you can probably catch them there. The community may or not be active, but it sure is good and friendly.  Overall, in terms of gameplay, music, artstyle, animation, and difficulty (it's not an easy game, but it's not that hard of a game either. It just depends on how much you want to play it), I rate this game:  10/10 BUY THIS GAME. ",

If you have played the original Isaac and enjoyed it, just buy this already as this is just plain and simple better in every way (graphic preferences aside). This also runs much, much better than original due to not being flash game. So far I haven't had a single FPS drop even when having some absolutely crazy stuff happening.  If not, then let me explain. In Binding of Isaac: Rebirth you play as Isaac roaming through randomly generated dungeon levels crying projectile tears on different kind of abomination enemies while collecting crazy items which make you cry more, or different tears. Sounds fun, right? Well that's because it is.   By the basic definition this game is like many other roguelite games; you roam dungeon killing enemies and collecting items trying to reach the final boss. but what makes Rebirth so different are the solid 'twin stick' shooting mechanics and countless item combinations you find during the game which can completely change the way you have to play. This is what makes this game so replayable and interesting as it really spices up the fighting and can bring some ridiculous twists to gameplay.  This game is hard. This game is frustrating sometimes. But it most definitely is rewarding and fun. There are some 400+ items in the game (many are behind unlocks) and 11 characters to play as. Multiple floors, multiple endings (which also are behind unlocks). There's a lot to do if you plan to 100% this and lot of fun to be had doing so.  Not much to be said about the graphics, it's pixel art. Game has some cool effects though and it doesn't look too retro. Sounds divide opinions, some think original had better soundtrack and I somewhat agree.  I 100% recommend getting Rebirth if you enjoy any roguelikes at all.",

This game is great but not perfect.  THE BAD:  ~ The new music for most part is not as memorable as in the original. It's not bad in any mean but for most part not as good. ~ No mouse control at the menus at all. Also if you have a x360 controller it won't tell you want key do what on the first floor and the config screen shows all up wrong. ~ Some of the graphics are just overwhelmingly inferior to the flash version. Pixel-art or not, the troll bomb doesn't look like a trollface. Some of the changes are just a matter of taste but I don't dig all of the pixel art in this game and I love pixel art. ~ The minimap is useless because you can barely see the icons and you can't see the whole floor like in the previous game. A face that forces you to walk the floor to see further in the minimap for rooms you've been to. ~ There is only 1 resolution for the game. May look really bad (as intended to look like a SNES game) on big monitors. It's more a matter of taste but still... if the resolution was higher then the trollface would look like one. ~ The new sounds. especially Mom's, are just bad. Simply as that. The only good sfx are the re-used ones from WotL. ~ If you liked the gore of the first game then this one turns the dial to 11. Which is good. The bad part is with so many puddles of blood and crawling larvas on the floor (especially in dark rooms) it's hard to tell where you can walk. With practice it's not so bad but it's still bad for new players.  THE GOOD: You can read all of it in the game description. I'll just sum it as 'rainbow ♥♥♥♥'. Because it's a new type of ♥♥♥♥ on the floor you can find in the game. Really.  BOTTOM LINE: If you finished WotL then you probably have this game so why are you reading this? New to the game/genre? You may hate this because the game is not easy. Go play the demo of Bind of Isaac (the first game) to see what it's like. If you liked it then know that the demo is a tiny fraction of this game and you're up for a treat.  IS IT WORTH THEM 15$? : If you like the first game then YES. See bad points above because they may furiate you. If you don't like to spend those dollars wait for it to be on xmas sale or in Humble/Stars Bundle or Indie Gala. Can't say it's not worth a buy at any price. Should be 10$ for most time which is more than fair for the amount of time you can invest in this game.",

            "review_text": "So, Rebirth. Well the game lives up to the title. It is a 'rebirth' for The Binding Of Isaac.  It adds many new items and synergies as well as enemies and bosses. The graphics are fine but they are not for everyone. The music is fantastic and makes every single floor feel different. Having many new synergies makes every run feel interesting and new.   The changes to old bosses make them tougher but still similar to their old selves. Items that were useless before have gotten better with or without the new synergies. The newcharacter Azazel is easier for new players to use if they struggle with learning the game If you didn't get it at this point, I love Rebirth.  But just because I love it does not mean I don't see some flaws.  For example, Bugs. There are many of these. Some of them have already been fixed but some people still cannot play the game. Some of them make the game completely unplayable. Luckily I have experienced few of these.  Also some of the rooms feel a bit 'cheap' as they have a lot of space but only if you have the ability to fly.  This game will be harder to get into for those who have played many hours of the original. Many of the new bosses have combinations of attacks from old bosses or completely new attacks that take getting used to.  All in all it's a pretty good game. Is it perfect? No. But it's a good game. and it's fun. That's enough for me.",

The keyboard controls are wonky, enemies are annoying, and the overall game is just totally unfair or based on luck. The only way to get better items to help you in the game is to beat the game.. How am I suppose to do that if I don't have any good items yet? So if you like possibly getting your sh*t shoved in by enemies that could take a whole one of your three hearts away every time they hit you, and having a chance of not getting those hearts back until you MAYBE beat the first floor boss, then by all means this game is for you. I will admit, this game is addicting because the art is absolute adorable and appealing to look at, and that disgusting side of me that says 'Maybe THIS time you'll get a broken item' keeps pulling me back in. The challenges are fun as well if you play one that starts you out with something super over powered.

It's not really fun playing Rebirth over and over without any new unlocked items or floors for you to discover  Also, 2 of the characters (1 is in the DLC, the DLC also has an unlock which makes the non-DLC easier) are complete utter bull-♥♥♥♥ing-♥♥♥♥   1 insta dies from everything, the other I wont spoil  TLDR if you're a complete slug: Boring game based completely around unlocks with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t characters and OP runs which are not fun, due to them taking any challenge out of the game  Edit: Forgot to mention that some items are automatic run-winners or automatic picks while some can be classified as 'hot garbage'.

            "review_text": "New companions, new abilites, detailed backgrounds and lights, playing coop with your friends... Sure, improvements are always great. But since everyone seems to like The Binding of Isaac Rebirth and I'm completely repelled by it everytime I play, I feel the urge to write down why I still prefer the old Isaac to the new one.  -Animations are worse. They're still and stiff, not even close to lively. -With the worse animations and artworks, cutscenes are not cool as the other one either. As I said, too stiff. (Not talking about the one when you beat Mother, it is an improvement, but you have to dealwith most of the game to see it only once... Seriously...) -Voices. Period. I loved how those bloated guys cry, the sound Isaac did when he died... -Where is all the good music? I admit, there are a few tracks that I've liked in the new one but... Seriously, where did those go? They were brilliant! Especially in the Depths/Necropolis. I'd hoped there'd me reworks of those but instead I found an atmosphere sound and emptiness. -This may count in 'Voices' but... How come Isaac's mother sounds like a 30 year old MILF? -With the new map, you cannot see any items-enemies-etc. at the top right corner of the room. -New graphics. Everyone's hyped about how HD it can be and all but I can't understand how easily you've forgotten the unique style of the original Isaac and how sweet they were. The new one's also stiff and un-living. They could still be HD and pixelish 8-bit style, keeping the original sweetness and liveliness. I too, am a fan of pixel art and 8bit style but this is NOT how you do this, believe me. -So many graphical mistakes... Ever realized wooden spoon's visual effect appears also on the hair? I was only on the skin before, like properly. Duh. ♥♥♥♥♥ of babylon is not even close to what it used to be with broken horns. -There is a thing written in even the worst quality pixel art tutorial: CLEAN UP THE LINEART! I can see you missed this one because everything looks so rushed, dirty and obviously paid no attention. -In the shiny-colorful cutscene's chest's perspective is so wrong it made my eyes hurt. -Too much poop-pee-vomit. It's okay to a point but after a while it stops being funny but gets boring. The old Isaac had the perfect balance for it. Poop, here's a cute sound for it. And after a while you get rolling guts and twisted nipples and screaming babies with carved out eyes. This way it was more horror-istic, now it looks like a preschooler quality humor. -Also, everything sounds a fart-vomit-etc. Meh. -Gut's rolling animation is COMPLETELY WRONG sometimes. They roll BACKWARDS. Couldn't you just mirror the image when they were rolling to the opposite direction? I can't believe you did this mistake... -Though the new backgrounds and light effects are REALLY GOOD, since every other thing is a fallback, it's not user friendly. You can't make out the flies and blood drops flying to you while fighting five enemies because they're not even visible in that background.  Reminder: These are only MY opinions. If you've liked it, fine, good for you, go and have fun, I'm happy for you. But I only wanted to see if anyone else feels like I do.  I may still recommend it because it's still good, especially if you haven't played the old one. Still a unique experience in all those shoot-and-kill games. But, yeah, I still prefer the old one.",

            "review_text": "The problem with the game is in the little and often, small problems everywhere that just seem to just make the game feel worse overall:  There are more enemies, but they feel poorly designed, and just derivitive of each other. The only one that really feels outright different are the wall spiders, and that's because it's doing something mechanically different to any other enemy in the game, but it's still a damn spider. Many of these new enemies use the same sort of AI that charge at the player character at tight angles, leaving yourself taking damage quite often. The original was less like this, and was more about avoiding damage alltogether than just mitigating it and picking up a health container that seem in an almost limitless supply.  There are more items; but many of these new items serve very little purpose, I guess the same could be said of the previous items, but many of them feel out of place, both in name and in use. The majority of these new items outright tell you what they do, the previous game mostly just dropped hints, you had to more or less discover for yourself what certain items did and that was a part of the experience. The old items had significance, in a subtle lore perspective, but now we're getting to the point where Isaac has 4 different dead pets of different species and they all make him very sad in ever more objectively useless ways.  There is a new soundtrack; but it feels very hollow, i've played the game for 7 hours and I found myself turning off the music before the first 2. It's mostly generic guitars and brooding chords that honestly, don't stack up to the original's soundtrack and it's fantastic atmosphere creation.  It is a new engine with a new style, but the art style is now twisted into the curse and cliche of the 'retro indie', where there has to be jagged edges and PIXELS.  I have yet to try the co-op as of yet, and probably will not, but I appreciate how it might be a thing some people may enjoy.  I dislike the fact that you cannot use the mouse in conjunction with the keyboard,(or at all honestly, not even for navigating the menus) especially when there are a few items that would infact benefit from it, I would say that using wasd and the arrow keys in contradicting patterns is not something I can handle.  I strongly dislike how the tutorial square didn't infact show the default keybinds for the game. This seems like a very small issue, but given that I actually had trouble finding which key was the 'drop bomb' key, I think it's worth mentioning. For some reason, despite it being bound to both the q and shift key in the original, and how you can bind multiple keys to the same action in rebirth, it didn't cross the developers' minds to echo the previous game and use a double keybind.  Also, once in game, you cannot check the keybinds in the options menu, god forbid if you change a key before you start playing the game and have to quit to change it, or you spend 5 minutes pressing random keys on the keyboard because once in game you can't even look at the controls.  Although I am 'recommending' this game, it is certainly not flawless, and I would actually recommend the original game with it's awful flash engine over rebirth, to newcomers of this 'series'.",

The fun of this game is seeing how far you can get with what you have, but luck will have it that you have little. Theres many scenarios where you must choose how to spend an item, and in general, make do with what you get. Experimenting with all the different items is alot of fun.  But at the end of the day, you cant win without stat increases. If you only get bad pill spawns or active after active after active items, you can only make it so far without some sort of sheilding or durability. Once you know what all the items do and which characters are the best, you start to notice that some items are better off just not taking, or the game will just not give you any resources like keys or bombs, and only give you gold and stone chests. Then you start to instantly quit and spawn a new dungeon until you get something you like.  But it doesnt matter if you try over and over and over to get a good start or just get fun items, its entirely luck based. I honestly cant say whether or not anyone will like this game because their experience can be fortunate one, or the game just gives you bad items or starves you at every turn, and you just wont complete the game until you restart countless times.

Since you're currently browsing reviews for Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, instead of actually playing this outstandingly awesome game, you're probably not too good at being smart.

Let's find out using our scientifically proven method! Just check if any of these utterly ridiculous statements taken from our very own 'Negative Reviews' leprosorium seem valid to you and/or prevent you from enjoying BoI:Rebirth, then get your results at the end of the page! Here we go!   Negative Review #1   Why nobody told me this game's gonna have PIXELS? Don't you know that PIXELS have NO SOUL?! Let me get this straight: flash = soul, pixels = no soul. How am i supposed to enjoy my ISAAC without a SOUL? Unbelievably unsatisfied. 1/10. P.S. I don't know what 'filter' are you talking about, i've played for 5 minutes and uninstalled this piece of garbage.   Negative Review #2   OMG! THIS GAEM WON'T EVEN STARTE! IT SEZ THAT WTFBBQ.DLL MISSING!!1 LOL SUCH A GOOD GAMNE LAWL UPD. NO I DONT HAEV TIEM TO GOOGEL IT LOL THIS GAEM IS NOT OPTIMIESD FOR NORMAL POEPLE LIEK ME   Negative Review #3   WHAT DO YOU MEAN this is meant to be played with a controller?! I'm a hardcore pee-cee gamer! Also, do you realize how much an xbox gamepad is worth! You know how many burgers could i buy with THAT money? Plenty of them!   Negative Review #4   Duh, i've been playing original Isaac for 12,000 hours now, and i should say i'm totally disappointed by a lack of challenge in Rebirth. Maybe for some lesser 'casual' gamers it will suffice, but to me that's just too easy, geez. Guess' i'll have to speedrun WoL 1000 times more.   Negative Review #5   New music SUX! And it's not like i can turn it off, that would take whole 5 seconds i could've been spending writing comments on Reddit about how much new music SUX! Giff money back now!!   Negative Review #6   I died on the 2nd floor and guess what? NO CONTINUES! The devs are obviously terrible at game design.    Negative Review #7   It's been 3 years, and still there isn't a single black or asian guy in the main cast. Wtf people, why do you support such racist games? If i didn't suspect Isaac of being a latent homosexual, i'd be already sueing this for sexism, too!   Bonus: Negative Review #8   When i paid for this, i was hoping for a *totally new experience*, not the same old boring Isaac game! I mean, what is this - new graphics, mechanics, characters, items... They could've just packed all of this in a $3 DLC. What a rip-off!   And now for your results!      If none of given statements appeared reasonable to you and/or affected your ability to enjoy BoI: Rebirth:    Congratulations! You appear to be an intelligent person, after all! Your only problem seems to be that you're still reading this nonsense instead of playing a great game! So what are you waiting for? Launch your copy of Binding of Isaac: Rebirth and have fun!        If you could somewhat agree with some of the points presented in given statements and/or some of them seem valid to you:    It seems that you might've experienced a bit of brain damage in the past, but there's still hope! Be sure to abstain from any AAA titles, pretentious artsy indie games, Android apps and Assasin's Creed for a while. If the problem persists, a week-long Dwarf Fortress diet may help.       If most given statements seem perfectly valid and well-argumented to you and/or represent the exact causes of why you can't enjoy Binding of Isaac: Rebirth:    Uh-oh! Looks like your general lameness, lack of taste, deficiency of common sense and inability to conduct any amount of research before spending your money on a game have led to terrible consequences! We have no other choice but to pronounce your brain death! Please proceed to  Reddit.com  now, and continue to observe its main page until three ot more of your vital organs cease to function.

            "review_text": "90 hours in, I think I'm finally ready to review Rebirth. TL;DR - if you don't mind the religious overtones and iconography, there is no reason not to own this game.  I never got into the original Isaac for a few reasons, Flash chief among them. But with Rebirth's new engine I decided it was time to give it another go. For those unfamiliar with The Binding of Isaac, it is a top-down, permadeath dungeon crawler with randomized layouts and powerups. From far away, you could mistake it for a dungeon from the original Legend of Zelda in both gameplay and UI, and you wouldn't be entirely wrong. If you married the gameplay and aesthetic of Legend of Zelda with the random generation, item variety and permadeath from the Rogue-like genre, you get Isaac.  Each run of Isaac is unique: The items, monsters, bosses, floor layouts, curses and more all change with each playthrough. Heck, there are special 'dice rooms' which can change the whole playthrough on the fly.  The game excels at providing the carrot on a stick needed to keep bringing the player back for another go. As the 170+ achievements hint, there are quite a few unlockables. Each run can take 30-90 minutes, and you are generally rewarded for every run completed so long as you've done something you hadn't yet done before. For example, there are several characters unlocked at the beginning of the game, each of which unlocks something once its first run is complete. There are many different bosses you can face at the end of each floor, many of which also unlock something when first defeated.  Not all is well, unfortunately. Given the dozens (hundreds?) of items and pickups in the game, it can be difficult to remember what effects any given item has, and the in-game descriptions are generally lacking. You can easily find yourself regretting an item you've picked up, assuming you can even figure out what it did. There is a fair amount of ambiguity in the game, which ultimately steers players towards a wiki. This does further disservice to the game, as spoilers regarding unlocked content can sap much of the enjoyment of discovery.  The game also has deep, overarching religious themes and iconography, with biblical stories overtly defining much of the game. This may be off-putting if you are an easily offendable follower of the Abrahamic religions, but is otherwise innocuous and quickly forgotten.  Ultimately, The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is an enjoyable game with long-lasting replayability. The dollar-per-hour of entertainment ratio of this game ranks among the highest in my library, and I'm nowhere near done with it.",

Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, have alot of new items, including 16 new bosses, 4 new characters and alot of new rooms to explore. Really Recommend it 9/10  Now it's time for the more advanced stuff! First of all Pros and Cons.  Pros - The Game has very nice new lightning effect. - There are now a total of 7 curses including Curse of the blind Curse of the lost Curse of darkness Curse of the maze Curse of the lost Curse of the labyrinth - There are 3 new characters Azazel Lazarus Eden (Secret one im not going to spoil) - You can now exit the game without ending the run. - Lots of replayability. - Nice new pixel graphics that look alot better then the original.  Cons - The music is good, but not good enough compared to the original. - There are alot of terrible items that can ruin your run completley.  Anyway, the game is really good.      Go buy it.",

I'd love for Danny B to allow the devs to add his original music as an alternative or something, as the original game is one of the few on my Steam list that doesn't have the music muted. Another minor issue is how different the ending cutscenes look compared to the game itself and the other cutscenes (intro/credits/epilogue). It's somewhat jarring, but they admittedly do look nice.  8.5/10, Strongly reccomend for the price",

If you dont know what the binding of isaac is then where the hell have you been. The binding of isaac was a browser ame that was remade as a steam game and then remade again with a lot of new items and bosses which is the game you are looking at now,   The binding of Isaac: Rebirth is a rougelike dungeon crawler that has an up,down,left and right fighting style (no diagonals). On each floor you can get a new perk for you character that adds a cool new effect. The game is massivly replayable and each time the ending will be different. However it is super hard to get the right combonation of items that allow you to complete the game.  Anyway i give this game a 11/10 that you should get if you have the money.

            "review_text": "For context, the Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, is a remake of The Binding of Isaac and it's expansion, The Wrath of the Lamb, in a new engine while adding almost double the content. Mechanically speaking, it's a top down bullet hell type game with RPG elements such as health, keys, coins, and bombs. Furthermore, you utilize items that alter the game in various ways, such as one that makes your 'tears,' or bullets, orbit around your head. As a rogue-like, death is permanent (unless you get an extra life) and that means once you lose all health you have to restart with a new run.   While I have sunk very few hours into the 2011 predecessor, The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth proves to be an amazingly fun and complex game. It's mechanics are punishing (I find it harder than it's previous iteration), the charm in its dark, disgusting aesthitic, and the immense feeling of satisfaction everytime you complete a challenge or kill a boss keep you coming back for more.  Furthermore, the replayibility is essentially infinite, with almost 350 items that have been coded to always synergise in some way, and the procedurally generated levels mean you're always excited to learn what's behind that locked door. It encourages a curiosity that pushes you to gamble, to take a pill that could potentially end your run, and to maximize your resources to find new and unique combinations of items to defeat your foes.  That being said, there are still a few flaws with this game. I find the movment initially difficult to adapt to. To me, at least, there seems to be a moment to your character's movment that means you can't stop on a dime. This takes some adjustment, and if you aren't paying attention it can result in you stepping on hazardous obstacles like spikes. The music is not as stellar as the first. While I, personally, enjoy this track more, the sounds can be repetitve to the point of annoyance, particularly in the basement. Finally, the game provides too little information about items and mechanics. While this is part of the discovery, it can sometimes take several runs to divine how a specific item operates. Given the random nature of the game, these items appear inconsistently and thus it can take a week for even the most dedicated player to investigate the purpose of an item unless you go online and search.  Overally I give this game a 9/10, and I can assure you that I will be playing it for years to come. A few minor gripes can detract from the experience, but for a price of $15 I gurantee you will get your money's worth.",

One indie to rule them all!  -------------------------------------------------------------- Single Player: 10/10 Random events, very addictive, funny, and the theme is awesome Multiplayer: 7/10 Co-op mode is though but it is there, which is all that matters really Graphics: 9/10 Pixel art is fine, McMillen's art is as awesome and gross as ever Community: 9/10 Streamers, nice wiki and many videos --------------------------------------------------------------",

The game was incredibly difficult with a learning curve that didn't seem worthy of this game; however, I couldn't be more happy that I spent the 80 hours I had in it. When Rebirth finally came out, I was truly impressed by the creativity of the devs. The item interactions and the mechanics of the game are inspiringly done, with a TON of new items being introduced compared to the original, as well as a slew of new floors for people who wish to challenge themselves past Satan and Isaac.   Pros: -Runs very well on most specs. -There are fewer straight up 'bad' items in Rebirth -The music for the basement levels are amazing -The dev team clearly wanted this game to be the best it could be with the new engine, which runs 3x more smoothly than the original, as well as patches put out to fix bugs and balance issues that occur. -New characters can give you a challenge or an easier time depending on who you choose.  Cons: -Music after basement level is pretty uninspired -Those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed bone-tossing skeletons",

            "review_text": "The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is a must buy for anyone that loves a good challenge in their games. After your mother accepts an outrageous request from God, telling her to sacrifice her own son to prove that she truely loves him, Isaac escapes deep down below to the depths of this very hostile basement. The basement itself is randomly generated and so are the enemies that inhabit the rooms, this adds to the replayability tremendously. The basement is made up of various rooms that can either suprise you, by throwing a large amount of creatures in them, or disappoint you as some of the rooms that i've discovered bare only piles of feces. Some doors lead to very exciting rooms though, giving you unique items that change the way you play the game and change Isaac's appearance as you combine all these different treasures to your arsenal. Each item that you pick up has it's own incredible effect on you, from being nothing but a floating head to avoid spikes below, to homing tears and lazer beams, but of course if you've aready played the original game then you knew all of this. What does The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth do to deserve a remake you ask? Well there is a number of changes this game does to further drive your addiction to the point where you just accept your defeat and play the entire day away. First off, the graphics and sound have been completly remade and it nails these elements perfectly although every now and then I've experienced random drops in frame rate that leads to loosing a couple hearts in a chaotic battle. The soundtrack has been remade and you won't hear the marvelous ambient McMillen songs like before but overall they'yre appropriate for each basement you enter, adding a dark grimy feel to each song. You will notice the sound difference as enemies sound clearer then ever before and at times I tilted my head like, 'what the f**k was that?' as most of the enemies we've come to love/hate have their voices changed to a different growl or yelp. The basement has experienced quite a few changes as well, some rooms can change in size which allows for more enemies to spawn in and more room to avoid them as well. The number of power up items from the last game as well as all the combinations you can have with all of them has drastically been enhanced and makes for very exciting gameplay. The gameplay has stayed the same from the original and feels right at home. It's like getting a new system for your home and setting the old one a little to the side, You'll still be able to experience the amazing classics that old system had to offer but now you can experience more new and improved content as well. The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is truely what all the fans of the orignal have asked for. There is a new HARD difficulty that I'm sure all the experienced players can jump right into and for newcomers is a perfect insentive to strive further and up your skill level to be able to reach that difficuty in the near future. There is also Local Co-op which is perfect for a team run when you need a hand with reaching farther into the dungeons. There is quite a few new baddies as well with unique abilities that will puzzle you and make you laugh just the same as you figure out their methods of attacking. The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is EXACTLY what fans of the orignal have been asking for (even if you haven't been asking, it's what you NEED) and for newcomers, this game is a must buy. Now get in there and face the dark challenges below and emerge victorious!",

Maybe it was because I played the previous version so much, but... I didn't expect to beat mom on the first go... Still, that was on normal (yes, this version has different difficulty settings). Still... i have lots more to do on this game as I have only beaten mom so far, and have to get to all the other bosses for more endings. Even though this is a rehash of the original game, I still have to recommend it to those who either haven't played the game before and enjoy a good challange and a bit of shoot em up, or to the veterans who want something a bit fresh in looks and some challanges.",

It can admittedly be a major annoyance with some enemies, but it does really add the effect that you are a tiny fleshy being that must really struggle for survival. It may sound strange, but that is a big part of the game. Not surviving, but to struggle to survive.   For a game this type, it has fantastically deep gameplay, sometimes making you choose between some of the hardest decisions you can. For example: 'Should I take this item, for the cost of my hearts, or should take this item that costs only one heart, but doesnt have the same efficiency, or should I leave, risking not being able to go back either or?'   It is also extremely satisfying with the amount of items this game, all with their own effects. It adds item exploration and you will never have the same kind of build twic. You could be the most overpowered character, or the worst piece of trash.  In all, I would recommend this game, give it an A+, and whatnot, but words are just words.

There are also numerous characters which are each enteraining to use (except Samson...)  It's very much satisifying to win each game, as the game itself is very challenging in most situations.

Pros- this game is randomly grenerated so you will never play the same maze twice. if you do you need to stop playing and get a life. this game is also very deep in that there is actually alot of information to speculate on, such as Isaac's mental stability and why his mom is a big fat ♥♥♥♥♥.

If permadeath fills you with rage and unreasoning hate for your keyboard and mouse, you shouldn't be here. If even the slightest mention of religion makes you feel like your own belief's are being attacked, leave. Otherwise, continue on.  A run usually last around 30 minutes to begin and it eases you in slow and simple, as the levels go on it gets harder and darker but you unlock more items and more characters to experiment with. The graphics are pixel art done right and it fits the dark, dreamlike quality of the story and game, and the music and sound effects perfectly suit the gory enemies and disturbing setting.  The replayability is quite frankly endless, there are several hundred items and multiple characters with very different play styles and starting abilities. There is permadeath, but everytime you die chances are you'll have unlocked a new item or character on your playthough to try out on your next run, no run feels wasted in Isaac, because you're always seeing something new.  The story and setting has religious overtones, but it is hard to know just how much of it is in the mind of the protagonist Isaac and his own interpretation of the changes in his life. The story is very much open to interpretation, making the 'endings' very thought provoking.  For the money, this game is excellent and one of the best rogue-lites I have ever played. It runs on damn near anything and can be played for hundreds of hours. Highly recommended.",

The difficulty of the game changes owing to the random setup. In any case, be prepared to die many times before you slip into your groove. The amount and variety of power-ups is astounding, and if you are lucky enough to run across items that synergize you can become unstoppable.  This is easliy my favorite game at the moment.

            "review_text": "I have mixed feelings about this game so far. There's enough new content that I think its worth being its own game, and I really like the new engine and better FPS. There's new and interesting level design, enemies, bosses, and items, and the technical issues that existed in the old game seem to be fixed (*cough* Brimstone *cough*). I also like the save files and new characters, not to mention controller support and local CoOp! Content wise, the game is very satisfying. It might just be me, but I also find it a good bit harder (and I haven't even tried hard mode yet) because of the unpredictability of the movements of the new enemies and because your base tears seem to be a bit weaker and slower. Whether or not this is a good thing is debateable.  My only real issues are small ones, admittedly. I am in the minority that doesn't really care for the new graphics, since even though a lot of the sprites have added detail and granularity, which is great, I feel they take away from the unique, clean look the developer's other games had. They used to really stand out, and now they've just hopped onto the pixel art bandwagon. Don't get me wrong, I really love and appreciate pixel art when its done right, but I just don't think BoI-R does it right. Pixel art doesn't have to look fuzzy and cheap, and theirs just does. Also on the topic of looks, this game is a lot more explicitly gross, gorey, and disgusting, which I don't mind *too* much, but it is a little off-putting in my opinion. Its hard to keep playing a game that gives you a continuous slight queezy feeling, though I suppose some would say that's the point of BoI. Just as a warning though, if the first game's gore made you uncomfortable, this one will probably make you sick.  I also have a few issues with the sounds. The new soundtrack is pretty good, not really as distinctive and as full of personality as the first, but not bad. What I really don't like is that they've taken some sounds out, like the placing of bombs (which can be very inconvenient if you drop one by accident, since the bomb sprite drops behind the Isaac sprite so you can't see it unless you move), and I find the sounds they used for Isaac getting hit and the ones for various enemies to be just plain grating and annoying. They took so much from the first game, I really wish they had just kept the original sound effects, especially since there wasn't anything wrong with them in the first place.  Overall I'd say this game looks and sounds like a downgrade, but it definitely doesn't play like one. I recommend it, but I feel that with the decreased aesthetic appeal on multiple fronts, I'll be a bit less inclined to play it for hours on end like I did the first game, which is a shame because one of BoI's big selling points is its ridiculous replay value. I would also like it if they had put better descriptions of what items do in-game so that I don't keep having to pause the game and look up what everything does. Still, its a good game, and, for the most part, worth the money.",

The items and their synergies are amazing, the bosses are fantastic, the whole experience is absolutely worth every penny. Each run seems like a fresh start, but not at the expense of being boring. The runs are of decent length, and there are plenty of goals to shoot for and items to unlock to keep you interested.

I have waited until DLC release so you can imagine how overwhelming it was for me to experience so many new things. In fact it still is.   All the major improvements like:  - better performance  - less bugs - TONS of new items - advanced item integration (those 'sick combos' which were almost imposible in the original TBoI)  - new modes 'Daily Run' and 'Greed' from DLC  - new enemies and challenging bosses - seeds - etc.  and minor things that don't affect your run:  - gorgeous floor designs - atmospheric music  - ability to save your run and turn off the game - etc.  all these things and many others altogether create a beautiful nightmare that will suck you in for really long time.  Of course, Afterbirth has got many bugs, but it is only matter of time when Nicalis will fix those. They have done an amazing job so far and I don't see any reason for them to stop.   P.S. What I really would like them to do (not only me actually) is to unnerf the Azazel. I've heard so much about the OPness of this character and really wanted to try it by myself, but now he's almost unplayable.  ",

Together, the soundtrack and the graphics make a really great atmosphere. -TONS of new items, enemies, mechanics, achievements, etc. -New synergies. -Controller support. -New engine. No longer in flash.  The bad things. -Map placement. The map is really annoying and can sometimes block things, especially with the bigger maps which blocks almost half of your screen. -No mouse support. I use mouse and keyboard as the controls on the original Binding of Isaac. It's now hard for me to play without mouse, the keyboard and controller just feel off for me.

Every boss in the game is fun, at least the first time you beat them. A successful run should generally last an hour maybe a bit more. The random nature of the game helps make the game feel fresh and exciting at least until you memorize all the rooms.  The expansion adds a new, faster Greed mode with a final boss and a secret boss after mom's heart, both of which have the innovative ability to damage cap your tears. Also a ton of new junk and sidegrades.",

When you beat the first boss room, You get something like wooden spoon, It won't help you get to the womb, Reroll!... into magic mushroom!  Blowing up mushrooms, looking for pills, Pyro gave you bombs so use your skills, Don't take to long or you'll get the chills, Look there! An item that really kills.  Magic mushroom, magic mush, If you have it you might beat the Hush, Better than a snack and the box of stuff, Time to speed run and beat boss rush.  All stats up guarantees you get to mom, Rated number 1 on  isaacranks.com , Beat a boss or blow a shroom with a bomb, SMB super fan is better, so suck my dong!",

Style - Dark and juvenile humor held together with clever satirical elements.  Gameplay - Endless RNG play.  Updates - Two years on its second iteration, Isaac is still being improved and added to periodically. Challenge - Difficulty ramping from moderate to severe, the game rewards decision making as much as skill. Auto-save - If something happens, your game isn't Lost.  Cons:  Awkward map - Never quite felt fully integrated into the core design or reached comfortable ease of use. Stability - Controller / keyboard swaps are not smooth. If your controller dies during a game, prepare to Alt-F4 and restart.   ****  Rebirth / Afterbirth is one of the very few games I can return to repeatedly, and after long absences. The game never gets old, even if you've unlocked everything, you can probably still encounter a synergy you've never seen before or have a unique run that goes extremely well or punishes you until you die. This can be a challenging game. Understanding of item interactions, uses, and limitations can help you make decisions that can lead you to turn a bad set of dice rolls into a winning game. Experience goes hand in hand with skill to turn a frustrating run into a victory. Avoiding damage and landing shots only gets you so far - finding the things you need to survive is part of what makes playing Isaac so endlessly entertaining.   The style of the game may be juvenile, but the gameplay is anything but immature. This is a complex twin-stick shooter that will demand more of your attention while punishing the unworthy.",

It has a well balanced difficulty curve that eases you into the action, and many layers that just kinda keep unfolding the more time you sink into the game. If you're a perfectionist there are a few hurdles that may make you want to cry tears of blood, some made artificially frustrating through the many grindy and unlikely attempts that have to be made.  Personally a big fan of the stylized aesthetic and themes. The story is told in a very sideways manner that you piece together, and fits with the design of the environments, enemies, items, and playable characters to comment on quite a few topics (including religion, neglect and escapism (and dead cats)).   Well worth your money if it sounds even remotely interesting. As a person who wasn't previously very much into dungeon crawlers/rouge-lite style games, this was a great introduction to the genre. Maybe hold off on the Afterbirth DLC on initial purchase, and see if the game really gells with you.

Music is hit or miss for people who play. The original had a very good soundtrack, and some say that Rebirth does not come close to it (it is still good).

Replay ability 10/10 again this game never ends and after birth gives it even more replay ability. Items 10/10 wow wow just omg this game has like 200 in normal and more in afterbirth I don't know how many items in all. Achievements 10/10 again....theirs like 250 without afterbirth. Now to get picky difficulty well I guess it very soon so I give it a ??? Characters 8.8/10 only because azazil is the only guy without tears add someone with the laser beam plz  So we have some things without categories the ports psvita is awesome. And Xbox one and ps4 are also good Now 3ds and WIIU for 3ds I have one huge complaint no 3ds xl version only NEW 3ds come on you know what you are doing or at least know you do.  So overall I give it a 9.8/10 One of the best games on steam and think this deserves more DLC from the success of afterbirth thank you. This game made me love indie games.

This game is a must have! I would recommend this game to any one who uses steam. I have never found anything to complain about in this game.

The items and their synergies are amazing, the bosses are fantastic, the whole experience is absolutely worth every penny. Each run seems like a fresh start, but not at the expense of being boring. The runs are of decent length, and there are plenty of goals to shoot for and items to unlock to keep you interested.  The one thing I suggest is to get the dlc sooner rather than later, as it makes the game seem way more full.

After the game is played with a little more and things are unlocked and you're far more aware of what everything does and how you can use those systems to your advatage it becomes much easier. Or at least the normal stuff does. Then you unlock the lost and in afterbirth the keeper and the challenges get harder and harder. Well the game retains some of the brutality it does from when you first pick it up. But at least now that difficulty has been regulated to a smaller portion of the game. You start getting better and it starts getting easier. The point is the game has a good difficulty curve, and while the next step is always a little more brutal then it needs to be, with persistance it is possible and is extremely rewarding once you have reached the top. I still quite haven't but I'm on my way, and you should give it a shot too. A great game that I have spent hundreds of hours on and will spend hundreds of hours more.",

One issue is you can't use the low fps to dodge tears easily anymore! This game is very difficult, but, the point is to keep playing it and you will gain the skills you need to finish it.

Cons:  Recent patches have been known to make the game more unstable such as crashes. Some of the aspects of the the gameplay are pretty luck based and there is a chance of getting a run so overpowered that it removes the fun out of the game.  Some of the items in game are more overpowered than they are supposed to be such as sack boy.  The main overpowered damage dealing items (such as moms knife and brimstone) overwrites most of the other tear effects and they only have a small amount of synergies.

What really elevates it above other rogue-lites for me though is that it is entirely beatable on any run with the right level of skill; so often games of this type put some wall that requires specific preparation or a bit of luck in the item draw to carry you through, but with Isaac as long as your skills are up to snuff you'll be able to win every time; of course, getting to that level is not as simple as it sounds!  Buy it, and get ready to lose an awful lot of hours.",

            "review_text": "The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is sort of an odd game. It holds a unique slot in my gaming where, at the moment, I play at least one playthrough of it each day. It is kind of like Solitair, Peggle, or Bejeweled in a sense, in that it is a go to game for me when I have a few minutes to spare.  So what is this game? It is the dungeons of Zelda mixed with rogue-like randomization. The goal is to kill one of the final bosses by picking up items and growing in power. What makes this fun is that the items are randomized, but every playthrough is beatable. You can manipulate the randomness to do some crazy things and just break the power curve. But you can also get a bad room and loose a run in a second. The entire game doesn't take long to beat, maybe an hour? But the fun is not in that this game takes a long time, it is that the complexity unfolds as stuff is unlocked.  So what is there to unlock? There are items, charecters, and whole levels that will be added to the item pool the more you complete the game with each charecter. And even without that, there are challenge runs and greed mode. There is the daily challenge (which is a unique gametype with a unique goal sometimes). The updates add to the game without diminishing the core that is there, and there are modding tools and more updates coming. This game is the best.  The only negative, for me, is the aesthetic. The story and art style can be very disturbing and it kind of undermines the fun of the game...that said, I have got to a point in this game where I don't even notice the story or disturbing elements of the art.",

It's highly addicting, its basically a really great game is what i'm trying to say.   There is some cons about this game i will list here..  It's sometimes frustrating and multipile times you quit and you play it after a month or so.

No other predicament has made my heart pound faster (this is actually true. During a crucial fight, I died at what should have been my winning point. I could literally hear my heart thrashing at the speed of a piston in a lambhourgini engine) than this game. This game, however, still manages to be a fun casual game. If there's one thing I must complain about though, it is the soundtrack. Like the graphics, it holds its ground, but the original soundtrack had emotion, fear, and had a dark feel to it. The music here is very much like ambient metal, mostly because it is. This is fine, because the metal gives the game a more 'high octane' feel, but no more than the original.

The levels are randomly generated and you never get the same levels twice (with a standard play through). Your main weapon is a projectile. As you advance, you collect random pickups that greatly enhance or otherwise change the gameplay mechanics. A lot of items can be stacked, so you have the potential to become very powerful. The game is challenging, but every now and then you will have a run with rare items that really make Isaac (or whoever you chose to play as) into a tank. Not a real tank, but a killing machine. When you are running through the game with good items, it becomes VERY satisfying. The game has a lot of random elements, but you begin to learn how to play strategically to give yourself the best odds, There are boss battles, they are really well done. This game supports many different play styles and the re-play value is off the charts. You will never be bored.  I've never played the original Binding of Isaac, but this game is amazing. I decided to give it a go because I was born in 1990 and The Legend of Zelda was a staple of my childhood. I personally don't care much for the Roguelike genre, but I don't really think about The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth as a Roguelike game, simply because it only takes minutes from the beginning of a play to forget how upset you were that you died 45 minutes into an awesome run and are starting over with nothing.  Very addictive and very satisfying. I reccomend this game to anyone who enjoyes video games. I don't care what kind, there is something for everyone here.",

While the original can be exceptionally fun and rewarding, Rebirth increases the accessibility of the game substantially while retaining most of the difficulty when set to hard. Overall, I would consider almost every aspect of Rebirth a solid upgrade over the original game. My biggest complaint is the lack of an in game method to determine what an item does before taking it (or while holding it), but after playing a good amount of the original, I already knew most of the items. If you are wondering about purchasing the original, I would highly recommend skipping it and purchasing Rebirth instead. The smooth 60fps compared to the sluggish 30fps + slowdowns of the original alone make it worth the difference. Both games have the same 'story' and Rebirth is truly a remastered (upgraded) original.  Verdict: 9.5/10",

As a big indie fan, I have always looked forward to games published by NICALIS, and this was one I looked foward to for several months.

When the Binding of Isaac: Rebirth first came out, I played it until I gave out. From boredom in class to casual gaming, I clocked in at exactly 41 hours my first week, already exceeding my Vanilla and Wrath of the Lamb time.  One of the major complaints I heard about the game was the soundtrack by Ridiculon. Personally, I found this soundtrack perfectly fine, and that's not to say it was any worse than Danny Baranowsky's soundtrack for the original Binding of Isaac.  At hour 173, I completed what I believe to be as the most difficult thing I've ever done in a videogame, I finally completed the requirements for (spoiler alert!) The Lost.  After 201 hours of sitting and (see verbs above), on the same day I spent 7 straight hours pressing 'R' and trying to get the f-cking Book of Revelations, I finally completed the game with the (another spoiler alert!) REAL PLATINUM GOD. Now I sit here and wait the infamous DLC: Afterbirth.   And do you know what the best part of this game is?

Pros- Hundreds of item combinations to make you either extremely overpowered for a run, or completely trash-like for the time until you die. You also get Challenge runs to test how good you can become at hard runs.  Cons- Sometimes it feels like there are not enough items. This argument might only apply to me however because of how much time has been sunk in the game. I only wish that there was a constant streami of content, because I would absolutely come back to play more.",

While the original can be exceptionally fun and rewarding, Rebirth increases the accessibility of the game substantially while retaining most of the difficulty when set to hard. Overall, I would consider almost every aspect of Rebirth a solid upgrade over the original game. My biggest complaint is the lack of an in game method to determine what an item does before taking it (or while holding it), but after playing a good amount of the original, I already knew most of the items. If you are wondering about purchasing the original, I would highly recommend skipping it and purchasing Rebirth instead. The smooth 60fps compared to the sluggish 30fps + slowdowns of the original alone make it worth the difference. Both games have the same 'story' and Rebirth is truly a remastered (upgraded) original.  Verdict: 9.5/10",

It is compareable to the changes Millen made with the Wrath of the Lamb DLC of tBoI back in the days. On the one hand it improves the game with small but important tweaks like better graphics, new music, a new announcer, faster animations and a HUD inventory overlay option. On the other, it also integrates 2 new characters, new alternate maps, extra challenges, alot of new items to destroy more and more poop piles, more achievements to explore and 2 new playable gamemodes: Daily challenges like those in Spelunky with premade dungeons (online ladder) and Greed mode which is comparable to arena campaigns and very nice new bosses and less roaming. This will lead to another potential 200 hrs of playtime, love it!  All in all, this update is definitely worth buying. It ups my vanilla version rating from 10 to 11/10.     Rebirth review    Why play any other single player game if there's The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth?!? 10/10, most of the players already know why. ;) It's perfect in all aspects but still lacking an online multiplayer gamemode, which is the only downside. Ignore the couch coop promise, it's not a real coop but 1 player supports the other as a brother/sister companion. If you haven't played it yet, do so! You haven't played any soloplay indie title yet that is superior to this, believe me! Unlimited replay value.  me = hooked  P.S.: I love you, Mr. McMillen, a fanboy! XD",

If you're like me, a big fan of Edmund McMillen and Roguelikes, there's a chance you may still find this game fun after 400 hours like I did and therefore should totally buy it.  If you liked Spelunky, Super meat boy, the orginal Legend of Zelda or VVVVVV, I'm pretty sure you won't regret your purchase for this game.  this game requires dedication.  If you're NOT like me and you wanna stay on a budget when it's not on sale and think you'll only play it for a few hours, just get the original Binding of Isaac for $5 on full price.  Then, if you find out you actually love this game then don't hesitate to buy Rebirth with the DLC. This game is the original Binding of Isaac X 666. You liked the ♥♥♥♥ed up themes? Have even more ♥♥♥♥ed up themes, you liked the randomness?then have even more randomness. You liked the items, the bosses, the areas and secrets? Then have a lot more of that. you fell in love with the amount of poop in the older game? Well have EVEN MOOOORE POOP ! Also, that's not even mentioning the DLC and knowing there's ANOTHER DLC on it's way with modding tools.  tl;dr: if you didn't try the original game, try it. If you loved that game, you'll love this game even more. This game is packed with content and a huge and great community.",

This behaviour is supposedly noticed by god himself who seeks to bring wrath to his heretical ways. God convenes with the child's mother and together they decide the most logical course of action is to murder the infant to death.  The story follows baby Isaac as he bundies through mum's basement in an attempt to escape the clutches of his ever so slightly looney but also very insane mother. The creatures of the basement are none too happy about Isaac's arrival and see to handing him over to the proper authorities. Isaac, in turn, seeks to win them over by crying with the grace and mercy of an M32 grenade launcher.  While Isaac's tears are godlike on their own there are LITERALLY hundreds of upgrades for every situation both in and out of the playbook. On average, a newborn in this game can present twenty times more of a threat than unattended baggage at an airport and can perform every function a baby would otherwise perform at an olympic level.  Isaac and his compadres can: - Cry tears in every direction at once.  - Bathe their enemies in fire and nuerotoxins.  - Utilise psionic powers to alter the flight path of tears. - Ruin perfectly functional walls with explosions. - Communicate with the devil. - Spout torrents of blood that pierce flesh and stone alike. - Use currency to obtain goods. - Poo and/or turn their enemies into poo. - Cry thermonuclear payloads.  And that's just page one...   If you enjoy crying as much as I do then the Binding of Isaac is sure to put a slightly bemused smile on your face.   ",
