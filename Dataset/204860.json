            "review_text": "All lies posted on the official description for the game as a story about the Penal batallions. The way it is described it is made to sound like it will be on par with Men of War or Red Tide but instead the 'campaigns' are just disjointed loosely linked skirmishes. Oh and its the buggest of all MoW's by far.  No voice acting,briefings, no cutscenes, no story arc. I was expecting an epic story of a criminal batallion trying to redeem their ways in the service of their nation complete with commisars shooting those running away. But instead it is just skirmishes and a paragraph of written dialogue with no reason to care for whats happening.  Very disappointed in this game. No where near the quality of Men of War and Red Tide(which were fantastic and story linked with references to missions in both games). It should not be sold as a a multiple campaign story spanning from 1942-1945 standalone game. I gave it to mission 3 and uninstalled a long time ago. Now sitting in my 'Junk' category of my library. A shame because the other MoW games are great. It also turns out there is only 8 missions in the game.  2/10 because the engine is still amazing. Everything else is utter lies and lazy design. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. I got it as part of the collection pack so my money was well spent on the other games instead.  Faces of War,MoW,Red Tide and Assault Squad are superior in every way.",

            "review_text": "EDITOR ONLY, STORY NOT REVIEWD  I like the men of war series, and with the steam sale I decieded to buy the men of war pack evenh though I already own some of the titels via retailers. So, I welcomed the idea of playing this very Men of War title as it would feature better graphics, which is true compared to the original faced of war/men of war, not that it matters because most of these improvements either don't work(hdr won't work for me) or are too small to be noticed(the higher poly count in the models, tanks are cubical and zooming in to see the faces of soldiers is unwise during combat as it limites your situaltinal awereness). Not that I really cared because I always prefered the ability to have massive battles and ambushes via the editor rather than it looking better, which is my main problem with condemmed heroes: the editor is ruined.   It is not ruined as in it is broken, no not at all. It just lists things you can place that are implacable, i.e. they crash the game once selected or placed. Not a big deal, all men of wars have had this problem, they just had it in predictable places. You could easily avoid them but here, no not here. Here they are all over the place. Look at that, gun_1, gun_2, gun_3 and gun_4, very nice except one of these will crash your game, no matter what. even if you only scroll over it: using the mousewheel to navigate the menu=crash. It gets better, as you can select certain items(be it tanks, guns or even soldiers) without crashing the game, but when you place them the game does crash. The number of units is very, very, very small. There are only two factions whith the germans having their regular number of units(less even when it comes to vehicles) and the russian have a lot more units. Sounds nice, doesn't it? Perhaps it does, but some of the russian units make the game crash, or are the same unitmodel but with a name(e.g. John) instead of ''rifleman''.   The campaign itself has been untouched as of the writing of this review so I have no idea as to it being any good. Should you like the editor a lot than DON't BUY THIS GAME, buy the original or Assault Squad. Everything but this editorial heap of crash.",
