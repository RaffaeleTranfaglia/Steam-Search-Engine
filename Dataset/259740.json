            "review_text": "Hidden object and adventure.  Highs: I was impressed by the animation that went into portions of the game. It went beyond the usual throw-in story of most hidden object adventures.  The plot was decent and you were reminded pretty constantly of what was going on by contextual clues.  The location of the next hidden-object puzzle is usually hidden in the most-current location (a picture, etc) otherwise you can just spam the hint button and it will get you to the right area. High resolution puzzles made it easy to pick out the items that were required and lots of hidden object puzzles were present in the game (with only a couple of exceptions)  Lows: The doubling back to the 'guardian' to unlock the chest that takes like 20 doubloons to open was kind of annoying. It isn't required throughout the game, but that's not made apparent while you're playing. A couple of the puzzles had sections that were a bit hazy and fuzzy on large monitors.  All in all, this was a good game. I enjoyed the story. Not so much the fact that you were a talking character (and female at that) which disconnected me from the main character a bit. But, still it's a game and it was a good one even if some of the sequences were pretty obvious.",

            "review_text": "Largely paralleling Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, Nightmares from the Deep: The Cursed Heart is a hidden object game (HOG) that compensates its lack of substance and numerous narrative issues with excellent production values and a continuation of Artifex Mundi's proven casual adventure game formula.  The consistent poor delivery of a story so full of tone and logical issues is by far the worst aspect of the experience. Though I wouldn't say I expect much from games of the genre, The Cursed Heart was an unexpected low for a developer that I know to be better than what they showcased here. It's shallow, abysmally voiced, and weighs down an otherwise mostly enjoyable game. It's hovers right between ignorable and so-bad-it's-good, but winds up more obnoxiously persistent than anything else.  A slightly awkward world to navigate combined with the often unclear objectives were also a bit annoying, in the sense that I had to continually check my map for where to go as opposed to a more natural form of progression. Despite these issues I would still consider The Cursed Heart worth checking out if you've exhausted the rest of the developer's catalog. Its high production values and addicting game design (the reason for which I'm still trying to figure out) are as exceptional as ever, it's mainly the developer's pedigree which brings the experience down, having demonstrated a better knack than most for the genre and in doing so set a higher standard which they as are also going to be judged against.",

            "review_text": "First game in a present three game series.  Story: Museum Director Sarah Black is putting together an exhibition surrounding pirates and one pirate captain in particular, Captain Henry Remington. Unwittingly Sarah triggers 'ancient' magic and revives the cursed Captain. Captain Remington upon his revival steals Sarah's daughter, Cory. Of course, Sarah follows and stows away on Captain Remington's summoned 'ghost' ship as it sets sail for Captain Remington's island. As Captain Remington's story unfolds the player discovers his personal history, his cursed 'life' and why he stole Sarah's daughter. Sarah with the help of a surprising ally convinces Captain Remington that what he wants to do will only cause more tradegy.  Gameplay is basically set up to occur in three distinct arenas, the museum, Remington's ship, and Remington's island. The tragic tale of Captain Remington is revealed through the various characters (mostly his undead crew, who were cursed when he was, assuming the player talks to them). Rather reminscent of the 'Pirates of Caribbean' first movie and the tale of 'The Flying Dutchman'. Captain Remington's entire tale is told by the Guardian of Remington's chest, which contains the collateral of Remington's Davy Jone's bargain, whenever coins are found and given to the Guardian. Very keeping with the Davy Jones motif and legends.   The puzzles are classic, nothing hard or head scratching. The game even includes a 'treasure hunt'. (When I saw the 'treasure' map, it reminded me of 'Treasure Island'.) There are enough hidden object scenes to keep this a Hidden Object game. The puzzles and hidden objects scenes are intergrated well enough into the storyline that they do not stand out, which in my opinion is a very good thing. However, since the gameplay arenas are limited to three areas there is a lot of back and forth movement within the area until everything is completed. Some may find this annoying but the amount of things needed to be done and accomplished within the area keeps the gameplay moving.   Being the first Artifex Mundi game I have ever played I found I enjoyed the well written storyline as well as the overall gameplay. This game would and did bring me back to buy more, not only of this series, but other games by them, as well.",

For the price, I think you will get a reasonable amount of play time in.  The artwork is appealing and the Pirate Zombie theme is great if you like that. Puzzles are not too challenging, and there is definitely a lot of backtracking throughout the map. The skip functionality doubles as a hint tracker that recharges, ensuring that you wont be stuck for too long.  There is also a find-the-items minigame (among all the other minigames) and you can play mahjong as an alternative and I thought that was really nice.  The story is meh, nothing too special, but for the price I would personally wait for it to go down before purchasing (but I am also very frugal lol)",

            "review_text": "This game is one of those casual hidden object games, which one can find plenty of around. The game nods continuously towards 'Pirates of the Caribbean' and similar 'Cursed pirate stories', which could be a plus or a minus depending on your personal preferences. It does boast rather nice background art and multiple 'exotic' objects to manipulate from 'all around the world'. There is also a variety of ages where objects come from - modern, XVII-XVIII century and end of XIX century (if you care to go for a 'bonus' adventure available under 'Extras'). Some of the foreground objects look a bit cheap, though, and cutscene video quality is really way too low. While being very accessible overall (as a casual game should be) 'Nightmares' does not explain everything (like 'Skip by playing Mahjong' option or how to start hidden object minigames) very well in the beginning. However, there are no giant mechanical flaws in it, and the ones existing do not detract too much from the experience. Although the voice acting and overall sound assets are so-so, they do help to complete the 'pirate mystery' atmoshpere. The storyline is super-simple and although it tries to add a couple of twists, overall there is nothing grasping about it. There is a little humor to be had and there are even a couple of jokes that might make you smile, but overall the game tends to overplay 'serious mystery' part a little bit too much for my taste. A couple of cheap jumpscares are also available. Having completed all of the available adventures I can say that the game does provide some casual fun for those, who appreciate the appropriate setting and do not mind to solve some simple puzzles (with ample hints available). Overall it is a good title to buy in a bundle and casually enjoy when you don't want to strain yourself or spend much time with a game. Perhaps, it could also be worth a try for HOG fans when on &gt;75% discounts.",

(Something i realy miss in other hidden object games since i don't know every english word for every item) - option to skip the rest of a hidden objects scene by doing a game of mahjong instead (if you realy can't find an object and don't want to use a hint)  Cons: - voice acting is bad (but that's the case with most of the games in this genre) - just a tiny bit too easy (but that's a quite personal opinion here)",

This was my first Hidden Object Game, didn't even knew this sort of games existed. :) You play a female museum curator whose daughter is kidnapped by an undead pirate. Quickly you find yourself in hot pursuit to set her free. The game is the first part of a trilogy. While I didn't have high hopes for this game, I quickly found myself hooked on progressing through the game. The main game is a point &amp; click adventure, but combined with 3 types of sub-games. First there are puzzles, which are usually not too difficult to solve. Second there are the hidden object games, where you need to find a list of objects in a single scene. And third, mahjong. Mahjong? Rather strange, as Caribbean piracy was already stopped by the time this Chinese tile game was created... I found the game addictive as you quickly pass puzzle by puzzle and the story line opens up. Not a must-play game, but quite entertaining.  Score: 7/10  Pro:  + nice graphics + steady game progress + decent story + additional bonus story  Contra: - maybe a bit too short?",

            "review_text": "This game is strangely compelling for a casual adventure game that focuses heavily on hidden object puzzles. The difficulty  isn't really there - you'll breeze past this game, even on expert mode (and really, you need to play this on expert mode for this to be even remotely challenging).  That being said, despite most of my time being put into roguelikes or twitchfests these days, I found this to be a great way to spend an afternoon as I downed tremendous amounts of coffee (typically how I like to spend Sundays). Like I said, the difficulty is hardly anything to shake a stick at, but the game is pretty good at providing feedback loop to the player to always make it feel like you're making progress. The story is somewhat of a joke, but I can safely say that the 12-year-old me would have probably loved this game to death. The guy over twice his age... you know what? I liked it for what it was.  One caveat, however, is if you're going to 100% the game (which I did, so that's saying something, right?) you might not enjoy a second trip around as you'll need to play the game twice to get every cheevo. Normally I don't do this, but it was too easy to pass up. So why is playing it twice so bad?  The game offers an alternative most of its hidden object puzzles (there are secondary HOGs to play that make absolutely no effort to hide anything; they are thematic bits to vary up the found-something-in-the-pile method of providing the player items) in the form of 'Mahjong'. First off, I hate that anyone calls the matching game of mahjong tiles 'Mahjong'. It's Shanghai, and Shanghai sucks! If the game had real mahjong, I'd probably enjoy it a lot more (and no way that's going to happen). However, if HOGs aren't your thing, but you would prefer to match tiles to pass puzzles, you're welcome to do that. And you can't possibly fail, either as getting to a stalemate simply reshuffles the stack... which will affect your achievement hunt.  So, in conclusion: - Great time waster with some interesting if not terribly difficult puzzles - 'Mahjong' tile matching will shrivel your sack and must be suffered if you want to 100% the game - Recommended, but you might want to hunt for it in a bundle. It is not worth the price of admission, even with the extra scenario packed in for 'collectors' - Alternatively, get it elsewhere (cheevos are also in-game and just as useful off of Steam as they are on it) for much less.",

If you're into this genre of games then you'll probably like this one. It has a fair amount of hidden object scenes mixed with other types of puzzles. There is also a helpful map which clues you in on which area to go to next so you can keep progressing. Though some hidden object scenes get revisted and they're not as challenging the second time around.  Story is rather straight forward and doesn't have that many twists and turns, you can figure it out pretty quickly. But it's still told well and who doesn't like pirates?!

            "review_text": "One of the better HOGs I've played on steam, a very enjoyable game. For being all haunted pirate themed, it's not too scary, only a few very mild jumpscares in the game.  You play a museum conservator who is about to display the corpse of the legendary pirate captain Remington in your museum. You manage to wake him up and he kidnaps your daughter in his haunted ship. You'll have none of that and axe your way into his ship to get her back.   There are two areas; the haunted ship and Skull Island. The difficulty of both the hidden object scenes and other minigames is pretty good, neither too hard nor too easy. If you're stuck on a hidden object scene, you can choose to play mahjong instead. in the mahjong there are a few matches of different colour that takes away one HO item each, you can switch back and forth or just play either. There is however an achievement for both playing all mahjong games and finding all HO items without using hint, so an achievement completeist will have to play the game through twice. Luckily for that all conversation and cutscenes are skippable.  All HO scenes are used more than once, and all found items are removed each time, making the 3rd go around pretty easy.   The art is beautiful, the voice acting is good and the music and sound effects set a good haunted-pirate themed mood. The animations in the cutscenes is probably the worst part of the game; they get so bad it feels blurry.   The story is very good, to save your daughter you have to find out what's going on with the pirate captain and you learn his story through collecting and handing in dubloons to the pirate's cute-creepy companion.  There are maps available on both locations but they're useless as it only tells you where you are and cannot be used for teleporting or seeing if an area is cleared.  Highly recommended for any fan of HOGs, pirates or really games in general.",

            "review_text": "What I was looking for when I started this game last night was something I could be a little bit detached while playing. I stumbled onto a genre that I actually really love with this Artifex Mundi point and click style game. There are different puzzles, hidden object areas, and side games like Mahjong as you find your way through this haunted pirate adventure.    The hidden object parts were my favorite, I wasn't expecting to be so into this style of game either. After expecting to check it out with a passing interest I actually played through it almost 3 times so that I could get the 100% achievement. It isn't a game or series that you will be able to completely emerse yourself into the characters and story. However, if you want a more casual game to change the pace a little bit, this series is definitely worth a look.    The mini games are interesting, and you will definitely have to put on your problem solving hat from time to time. I found most of the game to be very asthetically pleasing, but there are some parts that don't look so great. The cut scenes especially tend to be very blurry and strange compared to the beautiful artwork displayed in the still scenes. I wasnt expecting to be blown away by that aspect of the game so not having my hopes up surely kept it from pulling me out of the experience. The story is about a museum owner who brings in a pirate exhibit and runs into a barrage of problems. She is harassed by the haunted pirate who sold his soul to Davy Jones eventually ending up on Skull island fighting to right the wrongs caused by the ghastly fiend. It has enough there to keep you interested even though the games are definitely the driving force that keep you hooked.

            "review_text": "This is an older HO game, as the low-def animation makes evident, but even showing its age, it's still a solid middle-of-the-road title. There are plenty of HO screens to play (or to avoid by playing a Mahjong minigame, if that's to your tastes) and while they do repeat, no objects respawn. There's lots of running around, and a pirate/ghost/love story that's rather romantic, if you don't think about it too hard.  On the subject of not thinking too hard, this, like most Artifex Mundi HO games, leans to the easy side of the spectrum, so have no fear of the higher difficulty setting. Also, despite the game already being a respectable length to begin with, there's also a modest bonus chapter.",

I highly recommend that game on sale or from a bundle.  i give the game 7/10 due to the short time of gameplay +1 for cards =8/10",
