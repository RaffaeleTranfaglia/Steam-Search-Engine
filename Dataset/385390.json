            "review_text": "'Hidden Mysteries: Civil War' is a short little hidden object game. While I do overall give a thumbs up for this game, I do feel some of the historical things should be tweaked. (But in my opinion our very own history books need A LOT more tweaking than this game.) I found the puzzles challenging, but not frustrating by any means. Visually the pictures are pleasing to interact with, as well. I played it more for the puzzles than the history that went with it. (I went in aware that I would probably not be getting any sort of a history lesson...The game would have had to go WAY more in depth to add to my knowledge, let alone my boyfriend's extensive knowledge. lol) If you like hidden object puzzles, then I recommend picking up this quick little game to pass the time.",
