Be advised that the game is way harder than any other game of this type.   The PC port isn't that great, unfortunately. There are no video options whatsoever and you can't even change the resolution. Graphics are still decent, though.  This game can not be played with a 360 controller. Which is fine because the mouse controls work just a great.  Overall 6.5/10",

I enjoyed playing this and if you are in the mood for a fantasy-themeed puzzler that requires a little bit of thought, or you want a generic story to go along with it, then you'll probably like this. A decent casual RPG puzzle game.",

The twist is that instead of sliding gems 1 square to line them up, you rotate a set of 4 gems to do it. This also builds up your attacks which when unlocked, transform a gem that you need to match up to unleash and damage your enemy. Good fun for what it is.",

            "review_text": "I loved Puzzle Quest, Puzzle Kingdoms and Clash of Heroes, but Gyromancer is the first game of this match-3/RPG hybrid genre that I just don't find fun at all. There's no equipment, no choices when levelling, you only get one unit in a fight, you can only have 3 units in your 'roster' at a time and have to take into a map and have to pay in-game currency each time you want to replace one, the overland movement in a map is sloooow, as is the actual combat. Some parts of a map don't open up until you defeat the boss - and then you're dumped straight to level selection so you have to start the map over from the beginning if you want to explore it further. And the enemies in a fight don't even make moves the way you do - instead they automatically gain action points (or whateve their called) and then place countdown tiles similar to the way goons do it in Marvel Puzzle Quest.  And I had to use a third party utility to limit the framerate to 60, becuase the game insisted on putting my GPU at 96% load for 800-1500fps, and the ATI drivers were as useless at forcing vsync as they always are.  Really, the only reason you might want to play this game is the 'rotation' mechanic for gem matching which I haven't seen in any other Puzzle Quest style game. And I personally don't like it, but some might find it a refreshing change of pace.  The story seemed ok so far, but I honestly don't want to keep playing the game just to find out what happens.",
