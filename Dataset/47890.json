While the base game only has the basic game content, you can still spend hours building houses, making your Sims successful in life or hey, even killing them if that's what you're into. Each expansion adds hours of awesome stuff to lose yourself in, whether it be tons of new jobs with Ambitions or new types of characters with Supernatural, each one adds it's own little something.  While the game is incredibly addicting, it also has lots of bugs. Some bugs have been around since the start, like the game crashing (happens mostly when you haven't saved for several hours and you just finished building your dream home), others only turn up when you start installing expansions or custom content, like the strechy babies and the hand-bowl (not actually sure where this comes from).  So, yes, I recommend the game, but just be prepared for glitches, crashes and a slight addiction to new content.",

            "review_text": "EDIT: After going back and re-reading my review I noticed that it was more of a DLC rant than review of the Sims 3. I will now attempt to rectify that. For more on the game, go to the paragraph that starts with 'Gameplay:'.  Let's establish the difference between 'Expansion Packs' and 'DLC'  Expansion Packs are like mini sequals to games. They add new features and expand upon the old ones. An example of a Sims 3 Expansion Pack would be World Adventures or Island Paradice. These two added signifigant ammounts of content to the game, as well as add new features like treasure hunting, and exploring, as well as adding new areas and features to base game items, such as the training dummy, and board splitter.  DLC is usually much smaller than an expansion pack in that the ammount of content added is neglegable to the overall experience of the game. This can be seen in things like texture packs, or more specifically to the Sims 3, 'Stuff Packs'. Or the cutting of features such as the ability to make your own towns, and replacing that with the ability to buy more (non customizable) Pre-made towns.  *Just making the quick note that while you can still create custom towns for the Sims 3, it has been made a far more tiedious process, requireing you to download a seperate program with a less user friendly interface, as opposed to the town creation system used by the Simes 2.  In short, Expansion Packs are reasonably priced additions that improve the overall quality of the game, while DLC is a form of nickel and dimeing justified by the additions of insignifigant content, and should never be the same price as an expansion pack, or full game.  Gameplay: The Sims 3 does not make any great bounds in inovation from the Sims 2 (The sims are a bit smarter, they won't drown if you take the ladder out of a pool now). It's still the same Point &amp; Click style 'God Simulator' where you can create your own sims (less customization options for vanilla, more added with each expansion pack), create your own house or customize a pre-made one. (While there is decent variety in furnishings etc. the developers still push the microtransactions with an in-game 'Sim Points' store, and DLC page).  You can still do (more or less) all the same things you could do with your sims from previous games, go to school, take several different carear/job paths (more interesting options with DLC), go to university (DLC), get married and start a family (streamlined without DLC), or even more outlandish things like go to the future (DLC), go live on an island with mermaids (DLC) Become a fantasy creature, things from fairies, werewolves, etc (DLC). Become a preformer (Limited options without DLC).   You can also controll the longevity of your sims. Change the lifespan of a sim from 30 days to 1000, your choice.  The game is owned by EA. EA has it's own gaming platform (Origin), since EA has it's own platform, it doesn't bother to optimize or patch any of it's steam variants (See Sims Medieval). So if you wan't to play this you're going to have to use Origin (same with any game made by EA really.)",

            "review_text": "Sims 3, for all it's faults and troubles is probably the best Sims game to date.  The open world provides a sense of immersion not achieved by earlier games. This is a feature that was missing in previous games.  There are a wide variety of expansion packs to provide additional functionality for just about anyone.  You can pretty much play the game however you want, you can make your sim an upstanding citizen, a socialite, an excentric recluse, a crook or anything inbetween. You can have your sims befriend everyone and be known for being nice, use them to express your darkest desires to ruin all your neighbor's lives, or even ruin their own lives if you so chose.   That is not to say the game doesn't have it's problems. It is probably the buggiest game ever released by EA, and that includes Sim Copter and Streats of Sim City. It is using an archaic branch of Mono which makes the Mono releases chosen by Unity3D look new, and has a severely garbage collector that leaves unnecessary cruft everywhere and instead vacates other objects from memory as soon as you leave the lot they are on. It seems either the core programmers didn't know how to mark something as a cached asset, or just didn't bother. Despite the size of the game, there is no attempt to use either a disk heap, or a secondary virtual memory segment to store cached assets, and until recently it didn't even support over 2GB of game memory space.   Tech support is nearly non-existant, but fortunately the game has finally stopped being update to support expansion packs, which would commonly break the game completely for older expansion packs, so there are fewer issues.  To put it simply, the game itself I give a wonderfully positive rating as a near perfect game for it's category. It is everything a Sims game should be. However, the backend is flawed at best, and often downright broken, while tech support is downright non-existant. Frankly, I think EA could care less about technical support or keeping their older games functioning on newer technology, and I think recent reports of having the worst customer support in the video game industry are not only accurate, but an understatement.  Still, if you can put up with these faults, The Sims 3 is certainly worth your time and frustrations.",

Lot's of people think It's multiplayer when it's not, they think you're on their world but your not, It's the computer! Well, that's the long answer, short answer no, It's not multiplayer.  Finally, I find this game fun to play once you've just finished a test, having friend issues or just plain bored. I also like playing this instead of doing my Math homework!

In the Sims 3 you are basically stuck with the pre-installed lots and then of course like the previous installments you have to buy all the expansions.   Buying the expansions is not what bothers me. What bothers me is not being able to make my own neighborhoods and customize them to my personal tastes like I could in the second game. I still wish I had it. I only have the original content version so that is what my review is based on and not any of the expansions. So I am not aware if they have changed that rule about you being able to create your own personal neighborhoods in now since later expansions have come out.

            "review_text": "This game is ridiculously huge to begin with, but for some strange reason it doesn't seem to have enough of the essential content to create a good story with the sims. I mean, in some ways it's a lot like Sims 2 (which I have loved for so many years), but in other ways, its frustratingly different. For example, in Sims 2, I felt satisfied with the game that I bought -- even though I hadn't bought any expansion packs yet. The game was able to stand on its own and impress me without having any extra content. With Sims 3, I feel this horrible dissatisfaction with the content, dispite the superior graphics and the exciting new *live* neighborhood. Oftentimes I can ignore the feeling, but some times it is dishearteningly glaring.  There is always this subconsious push to run back to steam and grab up more DLC so that the game can achieve some kind of tolerable level of 'rightness' -- almost as though EA was trying to do this on purpose. It seems awful, but I am starting to believe that they just broke the game up into pieces, called it DLC, and tried to sell it to people piecemeal! An additional problem, and a rather gamebreaking one for me, is the sheer size of this game. Once you build it up to a reasonable level with 'Pets' 'Ambitions' and 'Nightlife', things start to go seriously wrong. Bugs and glitches that once were just annoyances become major problems, lag that was pretty tolerable before is now making you mad, and loading times that were originally only a lengthy 5 minutes are now running into the range of 20 minutes -- and this is on the lowest settings possible! I have also begun to experience issues with the game essentially *growing* the more I play it. It automatically starts to get fatter and more sluggish every time. Not to mention the crazy amount of inconvienient game crashes! All in all, I suppose coming so late to the game, I should have heeded the bad reviews and steered clear of it, but as you all know, sometimes, in pursuit of a dream, a gamer is tempted to try something that they know probably sucks.    I would only recommend this game to someone with a ton of patience and a 5 star computer system :P",

Their AI isn't horrible, and they will self-perserve as best as possible without your input (although they're still horrible at it). There are also a lot more interactions with the world and other sims that help flesh out your little community.  Cons: You need the DLCs. Maybe not all of them, but you need at least one of the larger expansions and a few content packs. The base game is okay, but it's obvious that a lot of things that should have been in the base game, such as modifications and extra options for various careers, were not in specifically so EA could sell it to you later. And as always, the more add-ons you have, the worse the game performs, so there's always this balancing act.   Pro?Con?: You will wonder where the last 8 hours of your day went... frequently.  Verdict: I can only recommend this game earnestly if you are okay with buying some of the DLC. If not, then you're in for maybe 15 hours or so of enjoyment before you get bored of having the same items, doing the same careeers, and generally following the same path over and over again.",

The Sims 2 on PS2 was my favorite out of all the games, because you could control the sim instead of just telling them to do this or do that. However, my second favorite game in the francise is The Sims 3 for PC. Now, I've played more than just The Sims 3, so I can honestly I like it better than The Sims Castaway, The Sims, and The Sims 2: Pets. Note: The Sims 3 is the only one I have played on the PC, the rest were for PS2. There's just more customization, better graphics, more actions you can do, more speech choices, and more ages. I would love to get the DLC's, especially Pets and Supernatural, but as I said in the beginning of this review, it just doesn't seem worth it to me. I know the developers and everyone else involved in making the game deserve to get paid for what they worked so hard creating, but the prices aren't realistic. Most average gamers don't have the money to pay for all of these DLC's that, really, don't add near enough to the game to be worth the same amount as the actual game itself. This is why I give the game about a 8/10. If the prices of the DLC's were the same as what I paid for the game (CAD $4.99 during the 2016 Summer Sale) and they had included the option to have control over your sims like in The Sims 2, then I would give this a 10/10.  Summary? Great good, bad DLC prices, 8/10 rating.",

            "review_text": "The Sims 3 is the next sensible step of development for the The Sims series, namely the open world feature. It's a great concept, but some people may find this game incredibly laggy. I personally haven't had issues with it, maybe the occasional crash, but other users have reported serious lag. All I can say is check the specs; don't chance it is doesn't meet minimum requirements. The Sim customisation and traits is great and adds a lot to the gameplay, but I've always found that the Sims look a bit weird, and the game has lost some of its charm compared to The Sims 2. Not to mention, EA love a good cash grab, so the normal price is a bit steep- definitely grab it when it's on sale. Also another to keep an eye out for is the Story Progession is broken. You can get mods, and I'd recommend NRaas' mods, but there's a chance it can seriously slow the game down. Overall, I've never had any problems with this game, but definitely get it cheap.",

One day, you would have the money to buy a couple big games and/or a game console, but the next day you'd might have realized you spent all your money on DLC for the game and you could only buy a five dollar game or less! the base game is a fun game yes, but it gets boring after five hours. Sure you can see more of the world around you, but they had to take away some stuff, including the FPS. The game can be Fun or you wasted money on a game with barely anything like I did. Ive played this for hours sometimes, but then im bored out of my mind. Ive have mixed feelings about this game. If I had a choice of a sims game, I would get Sims 2 or sims 4 base game becuase they ave more content then Sims 3. Don't waste your money on a 'cheap game' and buy all the 'cheap DLCS' and then realized youve spent 287$ and instead buy like Far Cry 4 or Just Cause 2 which has the same amount of content or more content the te sims 3 with all the DLCS but cheaper, but if you like the sims, I would recomend to make a whole town full of your sims, but instead, like ive said, I recomend sims 4.

I watched that but i fell asleep halfway through and when i woke up Harry Potter was on, which i don't think have terrorists in but you can't really tell with these godless heathens), but this filth is obviously hiding somewhere because i just can't find it. It might be because my son was playing with this once, and he seemed to be having fun but i bet he hid the naked ladies and is now laughing at me because I can't find them so i will have to scold him for that. I would not even be interested in seeing them because i am interested in real people not computer games but i need to take pictures so that i can send my newspaper article to the daily mail because no good newspaper article is good without pictures it is just common sense. if anyone can help me get the naked persons back please add me it is important",

Also the version from the steam store is the only one properly working on Linux using wine. Anyone who knows better   please!!!    step up an tell me!!!!   The pricing really is a bad and absolutely not funny joke!!! These blood and money sucking ticks from EA literally push the gamers to quickly do a torrent search.  Although you can find legal and genuine activation keys for the main game and all expansions at a much better price in different stores, these keys work only for EA's crappy platform called origin.  Before you go for such keys consider following:   EA hates Linux!  Their platform origin is a stinking pile of cat-poop - what basically makes it horrible to work with even on windows - Now imagine how it performs inside wine!!! Well the answer is:   Origin does not work inside wine at all!  Not only because it was created by a bunch of mentally homeless cretins - but because these antisocial bums actually have   integrated a feature to lock out wine!!!!   How f*cked up is this?!?!???

            "review_text": "Let me start out by saying I love this game, but I can't recommend it.  When I first bought The Sims 3, I played around with it for a few hours before realizing there was really nothing much to do, nothing much to buy, nothing really interesting to put in your house. I've been playing The Sims since 1999 and this was the most boring Sims game I've ever played.   Then I found out why. The base game is not a complete game. It's the bait. And the DLCs are the hook. In a sickeningly brazen cash-grab that shows absolutely no respect for gamers or Sims fans, EA put out a skeleton of a game, made people pay full price for it, then released the rest of the game through waves of overpriced DLC. Now some of that DLC is really good and adds a lot of interesting features to the game. That's great! What's NOT great is that a lot of this should have been included in the original game. More clothing options, more house decor options, job options, skills...   Now I'm not saying things like the option to attend the University or visit the future should have been included in the base game; those are perfect DLC additions. What I AM saying is that there needed to be more to the base game.   EA released a bare-bones sims game, knowing that they could take more money from people if they released the rest of the game via DLC. There are now 24 Sims 3 DLCs available on  EA.com , each with a cost of $19.99. That's a total of $479.76 in DLC. Of those 24, thirteen are just 'stuff', adding nothing substantial to the game, just more stuff.   But it gets worse. The game is full of micro-transations to buy MORE stuff. For example, as you browse through outfits for your sims, or furniture for your sims' house, you'll notice pieces of clothing or furniture that you have to pay extra to access. Really? Almost $500 of DLC isn't enough, EA? You have to add micro-transactions? I never thought a video game would make me feel insulted, but EA managed to pull it off.  The shame in all of this is that The Sims 3 really is a FUN game. Unfortunately I had to buy nine DLCs (all on sale for $7.99 because $19.99 is WAAAY overpriced, all with substantion gameplay additions, none of those stupid 'Stuff' packs) before I could have fun with this game.   Enjoy my money now EA, because this is the last Sims game I'll be buying. You took a fun little game and turned it into a w-h-o-r-e.",

Sims 3 is probably the best life sim I've ever seen/played. If you like life sims, than you really should get this game. If the idea of helping a person, or persons, through daily life sounds tedious, then it's not the game for you. The basic game comes with two towns you can mess around with, one of which is a free download. You get to build your player's lot up any way you'd like within the limits of the games included inventory.  You help a character you create, and motivate to make big (and small) desicions regarding their entire life, from schooling, to Careers, to Hobbies, to whether they brush their teeth or not after eating garlic dishes. The interactions within the world can get crazy intricate... Or you could make it your business to create a Sim with the right motivations, and just let them do what they wish. This usually doesn't end well, but many have tried it.  I will caution you about the mircro/macro-transactions that Sims offers it's players. If you are not satisfied with the content provided, you can get more, but it almost always costs extra real money for your video-game objects. If you want additional towns, for example, you'll need to be willing to part with another 20-30 dollars to purchase it. You can also buy some pretty cool furniture sets with real money too anywhere from a few cents, to $25 for some of the truly premium stuff. While this is fine for folks with money, this can be problematic for younger players, or people with limited income. Once you've bought the furniture, you CAN use it in any future saves; so at least you don't have to pay through your teeth multiple times for individual things.  If you get this game, try to be determined to stick with the limited content you start with, or you will find that you've forked out over a hundred dollars in no time. Otherwise have fun with it. It's really quite entertaining sometimes.",

The biggest of these setbacks is the fact that the AI pathing in this game is absolutely horrible. Whenever a Sim gets stuck (and they WILL get stuck), the entire game will freeze as it tries to fix the sim's path. What this means for you is sitting at a frozen screen incessantly for minutes at a time. Luckily, there is a mod that can help mitigate this problem--Nraas's Overwatch--but it won't completely solve the issue, so be aware of this problem before you decide to buy.  With the mod, the game becomes much more bearable, to the point where you can actually enjoy it! The Sims is considered one of the best 'life simulators' for a reason. It's a unique game that has carved its own niche out in the gaming world. If you enjoy creating your own stories, constructing a house you've always dreamed of, or simply carrying out your most sadistic desires by killing the sims you create, then The Sims 3 might be the perfect game for you.",

You don't have to purchase them, but they do add some great features. You have to buy an expansion for pets, some ambitions, and other opportunities.

Since i have had this game for the longest time, i felt as i need to make a review for it. Starting off with base game, its pretty fun in its own right but without new twists and things to do, it gets pretty boring after a while. Although not all the DLC is worth it full price, so its better to get them on sale. Some packs are pretty cool to get when you can though, like Supernatural, Seasons, Pets, and etc. There is pretty much a pack for anything but again, better to buy on sale as not all of the packs are worth the $20 pay. Sims also has a website for extra content like worlds, clothes, hair etc. Which is pretty nice as well since you can get them with simpoints, but not worth to send money for as you can either redeem a game and get 1000 for free or watch some ads to get some.  You can either add game packs or expansion packs. The difference? One adds little stuff for housing or for sims, and the other adds new worlds, things to do, stuff for both sim and housing. So yeah, choose wisly. Overall I love the sims 3 so much. It's always a game i can come back to when i am bored of other games. There is so much to it, new games, adventures, generations. I can say that this game is worth the buy if you wanna spend hour after hour playing.",

            "review_text": "Despite being one of my favourite games and a part of a much-loved series that has a place in my heart, I simply cannot recommend this game with a clear conscience. EA has taken The Sims and turned it into a blatant cash-grab.  The base game is essentially nothing but the barest of bones; few clothing, few job opportunities, few furniture items, and all around just lacking in content. It feels unfinished, and quite honestly I'd be so bold as to say the original Sims had an equivalent or perhaps even superior amount of content and depth, and this fact disappointed me--Until I realised my(or perhaps EA's) folly. You see, it is true that the base game is lacking content, but that's because it's all locked in the DLC. Things that should've been included in the game from the beginning are part of DLCs, like the Ambitions DLC which also adds the ability to, of all things, do ♥♥♥♥ing laundry.  But as though that wasn't enough there's also METRIC TONS of extra content that you can buy for smaller fees through the in-game store, all for real money, and most of which should've been in the damn game to begin with.  To shorten a long rant.... The game is fun, but in order to experience the entire game you HAVE to shell out the $400 for all the DLCs. EA should be ashamed, and I'm glad they have their own store to hock this ♥♥♥♥ on.",

            "review_text": "Moved into a new town and got a job as an investigator. Somehow within the time of two weeks I mastered my job, becoming the best female investigator in the town, and became a superstar. Paparazzi started lining up outside my house, taking my picture and asking for my autograph. About the time that I got around to one of my easiest cases, I was hired to find some black mail on someone for a friend of mine. Rummaged through their mail and their trash cans, and couldn't find anything, I accepted it and started to head back to my client, giving them the results. When I got to her house, she was locked away in the cellar doing something or another and her baby, which for some reason was a vampire, was just sitting there in the forty-two degree weather. I picked it up and started to feed the darling child, waiting for her mother. After about a couple of hours or so she didn't come back so I decided to take the baby. I changed her name to Arya and then turned to a demigod that started following me around ever since I moved into this town, and then had her transform the baby into a human, add her to my family, and then make her look more me. Went home and decided to cut my losses on the case, happy to have a new baby. When I got home I decided it was time for a change, and divorced my wife shortly before an earthquake shook my house and this weird portal thing showed up in my back yard. This strange guy game out and explained to me he was a time traveler named Emit and that his time machine just broke. So I abandoned my ex, and carried my new baby around with me as I started to collect power cells lying outside my house that this guy needed to fix his time machine. After it was up and running, the guy traveled back to his home town and I stepped into the portal, following him to the future with my baby.   After getting set up and realized I had no valid money here, I turned to my demigod friend again and then bought a mansion before I started to set up my empire designing robots. I started to get really good at it, and as time continued it became very hard to do this and take care of my daughter at the same time, so I did what any sensible person who stood atop an empire of robots would do. I made a robot, a very special one, and then persionalized it for my dear sweet child of mine. I designed it after an old video game, and named it Legion before I gave it various personality chips, including a modified nanybot chip. After various tune ups I realized that unfortunately Legion was an outdated model, something I had to acknowledge as the empress atop a robot empire. I went through and made my greatest breakthrough, designing an updated robot that I named Legion Mk II, and shortly afterwards I gave him sentience. I also gave him the ability to feel different moods and such, and then gave him the capability to love. I sold all my other housebots because I decided they were outdated and no longer needed.   At this point I went back in time with my baby, and Legion Mk I and Mk II. I decided to keep the Mk I for old times sake. As I got back home I talked to Emit and told him I wanted to do some good for the world. At this point I remembered my ex, who was still living in my house in the present. I took Arya with me on my quest to turn the future into a Utopia before we went back to the future and I continued to improve my empire, satisfied that the world Arya lived in was now the best it could be, and that she was safe with Legion I and II whenever I was busy. I decided to do some exploring and discovered a crashed alien ship, it was pretty cool but at this point I was really home sick. I went back to the present with Legion I and II and Arya, and then decided to move back to my home town.   It was at this point that I decided to head off to University, leaving Arya behind with Legion Mk I and Mk II, my ex left behind in my old town. Not long after I got settled in, I met a plant person. I was a little confused, but didn't really care. I wanted to get my education as soon as possible and get back to my dear sweet child of mine, and I ended up missing her very soon.   11/10 Would Steal a Baby Again",

The best way to experience THe Sims 3, in my experience, is to install the Seasons, Ambitions and Generations along with any of the stuff packs that interest you, if any (though most of them aren't worth it.) Your game will still run silky smooth, you'll have loads to do and your sims' lives will be flushed out to the best degree possible without the sheer amount of content becoming overbearing.  I know many people think that EA is cheating them by splitting the game up into 20 some expansions, but it's not meant to be played all at once. It's designed for you to pick the expansions that interest you most, playing with all of them simply isn't possible unless you really enjoy consistent lag spikes.  The game has a lovely sandbox feel to it. You can make a sim that looks like you and see how your children could end up looking 20 generations down the line, or you could make a fat black man with a voice that could break glass named Nethaniel Ticklehack that really enjoys setting other people on fire and sleeping with balding men in his spare time.

The gameplay is simple; you create your own Sim, whether it be yourself, a celebrity, one of your best friends, your boss, coworkers, mom, dad; the possibilities are endless. You then buy a house, furnish it, and you are all set. You can even have multiple Sims in your house as well.  This game is basically a life simulator; give birth, nurse a baby, send him/her to school, get a job, grow old, and die. There is a big and blooming mod community, so tons and tons of mods are available to download. The graphics are a bit dated, and the Sims look more like Barbie or Ken dolls, but the gameplay makes up for it.  There are multiple expansion packs, but try to get them on sale because with a Canadian price of $19.99, that is way too much for only minor changes to the game. The expansion packs are only $4.99 CAD now, so try to get them all before the sale ends.  Pros: +VERY addicting +Mods +Seeing what your Sims do, how their kids do in school +Easy-to-use interface +Lots of expansion packs +Realistic animations  Cons: -Expansion packs cost way too much money, Into the Future for $39.99? -The fact it's an EA game -Graphics look dated, especially clothes, they look pixelated and murky -The fact Sims do whatever they want, regardless of your control  Overall, extremely fun game, and you will probably get hooked. I say buy this for full price, but if you find it on sale, get it then. :)  9/10",

But now the only thing I can do is start a new game on a at max medium sized map and play for about 1-2 hours before the games frezees (without some mods even this would not be possible), which is only 'interrupted' every 3-5 minutes by a few seconds of action.   These game breaking features have been mentioned time and again after initial rlease, nothing has changed. As mentioned above, I had fun playing The Sims 3, but this was in no way woth the couple of 100,- $ spent in total.

[Chorus]  She's the sweetest rose of color this darky ever knew,  Her eyes are bright as diamonds,they sparkle like the dew;  You may talk about your Dearest May, and sing of Rosa Lee,  But the Yellow Rose of Texas beats the belles of Tennessee.  When the Rio Grande is flowing, the starry skies are bright,  She walks along the river in the quite [sic] summer night:  She thinks if I remember, when we parted long ago,  I promised to come back again, and not to leave her so.

[Chorus]  More than 25 years later, the lyrics were changed. 'Soldier' replaced 'darky.' And the first line of the chorus was also changed to read, 'She's the sweetest little flower....'  In 1864 General Hood and the Texas Brigade fighting in Tennessee, were defeated. His men retreated in such confusion they thought the war was over. Many headed home, and a fourth stanza was added:  And now I'm going southward, for my heart is full of woe,  I'm going back to Georgia, to see my Uncle Joe.
