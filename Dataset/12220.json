            "review_text": "Grand Theft Auto: Episodes from Liberty City is an expansion pass for GTA 4 where you have to DLC packs which both expand on the story of GTA 4. I will review both as separate games so let's get into it.  Grand Theft Auto Lost and Damned:  This expansion pass follows on the biker gang Lost and Damned who are old school gang in Liberty City. The story follows on Johny Klebitz as he tries his best to keep his chapter under falling out.  This expansion is really good, for story, but not so much for missions.   Now I know that I should have expected this, from an expansion that follows on Bikers, but I didn't really like how much of the entire expansion follows on bike rides. But the story missions were fun and challenging.  Music wise I enjoyed the rock music in this game, it's a very fitting choice of music for this expansion and it works well.  The entire expansion overall is still better than the entirety of GTA 4, I enjoyed the story and action based missions, but hated all the bike stuff, because of how bikes control in GTA 4 overall.  Next up is Grand Theft Auto The Ballad of Gay Tony:  This expansion is better than Lost and Damned and GTA 4.  This expansion follows on Luis a bodyguard who works on a business man Gay Tony. The entire expansion takes place after the Three Leaf Clover mission in GTA 4 and is all about Luis trying to save Tony's dying business by taking up different business ventures.  This expansion is incredibly fun and I had tons of fun playing through it. A lot of the missions are really fun action packed missions and it fixes a lot of the problems that Lost and Damned and GTA 4 had.  The overall atmosphere is also not as dark and lightens the tone. It's also incredibly funny, the characters are funny and it's all really fun.   Lightening the tone also helps a lot, cause GTA 4 being way too serious made the game kind of boring to play.   This expansion also paves the way to GTA 5 like the medals in missions and multiple characters.  Overall this expansion is a great addition and is overall better than the main game, but I still suggest playing all three games.  Pros: + Funny and cleverly written stories + Missions are action packed so it never gets boring to play + Soundtracks which fit the overall atmosphere of the expansions  Cons: - Gameplay and Car physics aren't that good - Gun gameplay is incredibly stiff  Final Rating: 9/10",

            "review_text": "As I write this, the release date for GTA V is fast approaching. Hard to believe it's been 5 years since GTA4 was released.  GTA: Episodes from Liberty City (EFLC) moves the base GTA4 game forward nicely. There's two smaller storylines, each about 12-16 hours of gameplay. Both stories are interwoven with the main GTA4 storyline. Niko Bellic and other characters make appearances in these games, and certain loose ends are tied up in these episodes.  The stories are strong, the supporting characters are interesting, and the protagonists are fun to play. Luis Lopez, the main character in The Ballad of Gay Tony, is my new favorite GTA protagonist - even better than Vice City's Tommy Vercetti. These two smaller games are much more interesting to me than Niko Bellic's story.  EFLC delivers some technical fixes and gameplay improvements to the base game. Most notably, we now have mid-mission checkpoints, so if you fail a mission, you can pick up part-way through. This really decreases the frustration level of the game. Less notably, but important to me: traffic is more realistic. And, motorcycles are easier to control.  The Ballad of Gay Tony is the standout episode. It brings back the over-the-top flavor of Vice City and San Andreas. The missions are crazy fun, including a shootout on top of the Empire State Building, hijacking a subway car, helicopter duels, and a race around Manhattan -- excuse me, 'Algonquin' -- involving parachutes, speedboats and fast cars. There's a new cage-fighting mini-game, and everywhere you turn in this one, there's fast cars to boost. And, as mentioned, parachuting! There's 20 optional missions involving base jumping and parachuting skills. Excellent fun. The Ballad of Gay Tony pulls out all the stops to show off what this game engine is capable of delivering. And maybe, hopefully, it shows that Rockstar hasn't forgotten how to have fun.   If you need a GTA fix before GTA V appears and you skipped these episodes, you should definitely take a second look.

            "review_text": "GTA: Episodes from Liberty City is an expandalone (Standalone Expansion Pack) of GTA IV. They are a two-in-one game, with two sides of one story.  On one hand you have The Lost biker gang having gang and family issues, and on the other hand you are Luis Lopez, a part-time bodyguard at Maisonette 9, one of the biggest nightclubs in Liberty City.  I will be covering The Ballad of Gay Tony first, as I found it most enjoyable.  TBoGT has the most enjoyable missions in any GTA game ever, in my opinion. They are all action packed, interesting and never some sort of escort mission, or 'drive there and come back' type of mission. If you've ever played GTA:SA then think of the mission where you board the cargo plane, 'Stowaway'. Now, multiply that mission about 30 times and you have TBoGT in a nutshell.  You get to own interesting and very fun weapons and vehicles such as huge capacity machineguns and... actually I won't spoil any more, I will just say that you will have fun, GUARANTEED, if you have one of those weapons equipped, or you are driving/piloting any of the special, new vehicles. Most of the new vehicles, if not all of them have been copy and pasted into GTA V, as they were too much fun!  The story of TBoGT is a bit lacking, but it's enough there to keep you going. The characters in the story, though, are the most crazy and insane in any GTA game ever! There is not one main story cutscene that doesn't involve someone really high on drugs, half-naked or drunk as ♥♥♥♥. You just can't hold in a laugh every time a cutscene rolls!  Buuut, here comes the sad and disappointing part of the pack... The Lost and Damned.  Now, this might be a bit of a swayed opinion, but The Lost and Damned was just too boring for me. The first initial missions involve you riding with your gang, informing the player about who is who. The leader of the gang just got out of jail and you are picking up his custom bike from the shop. That's the intro, really, and it's a boring, long intro of just driving. The dialogue kinda made up for it, as it was semi-interesting. It is nice to hear the bikers talk to each other when they are in proximity.  You still get some extra weapons that you don't get to use in TBoGT, and even some vehicles, but nothing really stands out. There's a sawed-off double barrel shotgun that is incredibly useful at knocking off enemy bikers, as it only needs one pellet to do so, but it's inaccurate as hell and requires you to be at point blank range. I find melee to be more fun at that time. TBoGT has set the bar for that sort of stuff, and TLaD is nowhere near reaching it.  If you really enjoyed GTA IV's narrative and atmosphere, you might enjoy TLaD because it is much more slow and story-driven.  In the end, it's weird that it was packaged with a much more 'mindless fun' type of game as TBoGT.  I will rate both parts of the expansions separately, but the game is so cheap now you might as well just buy it for one and have the other as a sort of nice bonus.  TLaD: 5/10 - Generally boring, uninteresting, but has its good bits, and come on it's still a GTA game! TBoGT: 9/10 - Definitely takes the cake as it never gets boring until the end of the story.  (I have not touched upon the technical issues such as GFWL and such, but there is a mod called x_live_less (remove '_', Steam censors the name for some reason) that removes GFWL and may help you with any issues. I managed to play the game start to finish with GFWL installed and updated no problem, but this may be different for you. Keep in mind Steam refunds are a thing, and do not let this sway you from the purchase of this amazing expandalone!)",

Nico as a protagonist really grows on you and the main character just isn't as interesting. But otherwise, it works well as a continuation of GTA IV.",

In one of those stories you get to control this guy who owns a night club and has a partnership with this gay guy. As for the other one, you assume the role of the leader of a bikers gang. There's not really much diversity compared to the original game, but these two different stories certainly add something else to the whole spectrum. I also read in some reviews that people were having to deal with some crashes, I also had to deal with this really annoying one that would happen everytime during this mission that involved a train (The Ballad of Gay Tony).

            "review_text": "--&gt; ARGUMENT:  -Getting two complete games for only $6,00 on Steam is something that nobody have to miss. I know, I know the price after the offer might be a bit too high, but as thinking, these games or DLC's has 2 different stories comparing them to Grand Theft Auto IV. -The gameplay is pretty impresive, you will spend at least 15 hours to complete both of these games, if we count the side-missions, it goes to 20-30 hours. Let's see how GTA IV TLAD &amp; TBOGT behave.  -The Lost And Damned shows us the story of a group of bikers, known in GTA IV aswell, they are 'THE LOST'. The protagonist is Johnny K, the leader of this group is Billy. The game is based more on bike races, bike-gangs conflicts and much more to explore. -The Ballad of Gay Tony is the second expansion of GTA IV. The innovation in this game is that, Rockstar, added lots of stuff in this game. Comparing it to GTA IV, is sightly better for me. You play as Luis Fernando Lopez and Tony gives you different missions related to: money, clubs, thiefs and girls. Very stilish.  --&gt; GTA IV: THE LOST AND DAMNED REVIEW  GRAPHICS: They are the exact same as in GTA IV. The weather is a bit more different. Sometimes is very sunny and the ambiance is pretty orange, just like it's sunshine all the time, sometimes cloudly. If you have a good PC, you'll enjoy it. Some glitches are visible... (- 94/100 -) SOUND: More rock music added, just to fit in the game perfectly. Personally I don't like rock, but, for this game it's okay. Sound effects and everything is the same. (- 96/100 -) GAMEPLAY: Some bike controls are a bit annyoing. Bikes slips to much sometimes and that's a bit derp. Anyway everything is still the same. It has 22 missions and it can take you about 6-7 hours to complete them. But there's over 5-6 hours to complete the game at 100%, pretty good for a DLC. (- 97/100 -) FUN &amp; INNOVATION: The story is really excited, if you are really interested on a 'biker' life. There are many bikes and a few cars added which makes all of us happy, right? (- 85/100 -)  FINAL: 93/100. (VERY GOOD)  --&gt; GTA IV: THE BALLAD OF GAY TONY REVIEW  GRAPHICS: The same as in GTA IV. Anyway I guess Rockstar fixed a bit some glitches, the effects are a little more realistic, probably they've updated RAGE and what else... nights are better. (- 100/100 -) SOUND: Voice acting, sound effects, music, everything is incredible in this game. (- 100/100 -) GAMEPLAY: The gameplay is the exact same as in the previous games. The only implemented thing is that you can drive more helicopters which is amazing... There are 25 missions which takes about 7-8 hours to complete them. But there's over 10 hours of secondary missions to archive 100% (- 98/100 -) FUN &amp; INNOVATION: It feels like GTA better than nothing. More variety to choose, lots of things added (parachutes, helicopters, vehicles, weapons) which kinda 'spits over GTA IV, GTA TLAD.' (- 100/100 -)  FINAL: 100/100. (MASTERPIECE)  CONCLUSION: Rockstar North did it again... the best DLC's of the history untill the date... let's see what GTA V can do soon.",

ADVICE: If you're thinking of getting GTAIV, consider getting the complete pack that comes with this DLC. It kind of combines the two games into one menu and simplifies complexity that would entail if you got GTAIV and THEN got Episodes from Liberty City.

The automatic 9mm, Shotgun and pipe bombs introduce great new tools that can be used in an infinite variety of ways.  The story of TLOD is in some ways better than GTA IV. The events seem a little more down to earth and not mirred by more dead than living characters. Some of the people in the narrative do die, but not nearly as many as in GTA IV. The best, or the weak, survive and even though the Lost loose their home base, their pride is completely unaffected.  You cannot date anyone in TLOAD. This is a pity, as girlfriends would have increased the appeal of the game and the long term interest in the game, but this is its only failing.

While it has less in the way of RPG-like elements that made San Andreas so extremely replayable, the physics featured in this game are the pinnacle of the entire series. You can easily see how this began the trend towards realistic reactions for npcs, which were perfected later in Red Dead Redemption, LA Noire, and Max Payne. Even the new GTAV lacks the exaggerated nature of impact as experienced here, and it has the best car damage features out of any GTA game.   I do think San Andreas has the better gameplay, overall -- territory warfare and how you would be left alone if going against other criminals made for a fun experience that can't be beat -- but it's hard to go back to the days when characters only fall flat no matter what, not after playing with IV's engine. The worst part of this game is how the police seem to roam every five feet, and you can't get away with anything you do unless absolutely silent (even in the expansions where you are part of a crew, expecting to be left alone if only attacking rivals and not hurting unaffiliated innocents), but there is an active modding community where you can find ways of reducing the number of cops and their constant interference... if you're like me, and playing The Lost and the Damned, for example, where you want to go after all rival gangs for an immersive experience without constant police harrassment, I'd highly suggest some sort of mod to address this issue if you get a kick out that, because the cheat system in IV pretty much sucks to have to use.   Also, pro tip: turn your phone to sleep mode. I think we all kind of know that particular annoyance, of course. Otherwise, with the cover system, gritty look and feel, amazing physics, and killer soundtrack to back it up, this game is just as good today as anything else out there.",

The game runs smooth, better even than GTA IV does, although not by much. I had no problems changing the resolution, changing any of the settings in fact, and it even automatically imported most of my control mappings from GTA IV.  I will write more about the entire game and its storyline once I had a chance to play more, but I wanted to write this much, to counteract all the negative reviews of people claiming the game is broken.

You get two storylines, both having the things that made GTA IV fun, and new stuff as well. But what really got me was the fact that the world was wide open from the start, no strings attached! Although missions like to congregate in certain places at certain points, the feeling of freedom is a welcome feeling to me. If you want Liberty City at it's best, get this game, it's a great addition to the GTA series.

The characters you play with really distinguish themselves from their peers and they people they work with.  While this game is not a big step up from IV, it backs itself up well for being a standalone game (and not a mere DLC). Multiple additions to cars, guns, and recreational activities are just part of the game's added value.  Here are the things I liked and disliked about each episode:  TLaD + Biker life - gang wars, hot bikes, gambling, club + New guns (imagine shooting a sawed-off while riding on a motorcycle) + New bikes (of course!) - No territorial progression (raiding rival clubhouses and owning them, etc.) - Not enough biker gangs (you have 1 archrival) - Your biker members are all idiots (the AI sucks) - No dating life; lasting relationships purely within the brotherhood  BoGT + Nightlife and everything nice - clubbing, gay clubs, golden helicopters, golden guns + New cars (and some of them, fancy!) + Base jumping + Gay Tony and Yusuf Amir + Finally, a tank! (you use it in only 1 mission) - Handling of some cars is a little annoying - Hookups only, dating life nonexistent  Here are some of the things I expected, but didn't get, in the game: - Stealth ops (more disguises, suppressed guns) - Winter season (it snows in NY, right?) - The military chasing you at 6 stars - Smarter drivers - they randomly change lanes, do not use their turn lights before doing so. This was a problem in GTA IV that I hoped they were able to solve. I can't believe how many times I failed a mission because of an idiot that decided to change lanes in front of me.",

While Hate inflames his bosom, possibly He may feel contented with his situation: But when his passions begin to cool; when Time has mellowed his sorrows, and healed those wounds which He bore with him to his solitude, think you that Content becomes his Companion? Ah! no, Rosario. No longer sustained by the violence of his passions, He feels all the monotony of his way of living, and his heart becomes the prey of Ennui and weariness. He looks round, and finds himself alone in the Universe: The love of society revives in his bosom, and He pants to return to that world which He has abandoned. Nature loses all her charms in his eyes: No one is near him to point out her beauties, or share in his admiration of her excellence and variety. Propped upon the fragment of some Rock, He gazes upon the tumbling waterfall with a vacant eye, He views without emotion the glory of the setting Sun. Slowly He returns to his Cell at Evening, for no one there is anxious for his arrival; He has no comfort in his solitary unsavoury meal: He throws himself upon his couch of Moss despondent and dissatisfied, and wakes only to pass a day as joyless, as monotonous as the former.”  ― Matthew Gregory Lewis, The Monk",

What's more than enjoyable is the hour or two you'll find yourself in trying to set up game files, searching through every avenue of support pages, and the many attemtps at 'possible' fixes. If you computer has a video card with over 1GB of ram this game wont run on anything except the minimal graphics, no exceptions. Unless you have the day off work, are pretty computer savvy, and have a tremedous amount of patience. Also I will not be buying the new GTA5 because of this.",

It's definitely an illegal practice under any country's consumer laws, and that's why I can't, in good mind, recommend any of their games anymore, as there's no warranty that they won't be doing this to their other games.

Windows 7+ OS systems do not work because of some stupid SecuROM (or something like that) program which always gives you errors. If you want to buy any GTA, it's a lot better to buy GTA V rather than wasting 50$ on a non-working game.",
