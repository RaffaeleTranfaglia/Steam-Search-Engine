I returned to it now, 8 years later, and it's still a great dungeon crawl, and lots of fun. I especially love to try different combination of characters, to see how far it takes me. My favorite combo remains: Warriror, Ranger, Rogue and Cleric.  Can't wait for Godfall!",

(If you have any neighbors, friends family or flatmates fighting, recommend pumping your sound on your speakers, can drown them out with drama, healing and slashing effects. 8.5 out of 10",
