            "review_text": "Definitely a quality over quantity product. Make no mistake, this is a five dollar game with about five dollars worth of gameplay here. While some games at that price have managed to entertain me for hundreds of hours, this one is quite easily beaten, and once that is done, there isn't much else to do other than max out all of your perks, if that's your thing. You can also run Trial mode and simply try to see how far you can get through a randomly generated stream of foes without dying.  But otherwise, it's a very fun experiment in healer-centric game play, and plays more like a puzzle/strategy, than an actual RPG. There ARE stat increases, but it's a small part of your overall success. Most of the game play lies in knowing when to use which skils, such as using the skill that sacrifices one of your tank's limb HP for Mana then turning that into XP bonus or a much needed limb recovery spell. It's fun, and very engaging. There's a lot of quick decisions to be made. I particularly enjoy the meta game play of sacrificing Mana to get your XP modifier as high as possible while still effectively supporting your tank.   My only issues (other than length, which is a small nitpick) is that, at least for me, two of your eight total skills were somewhat underpowered or simply uncessecary, which sort of takes away some of the strategy. Though that may come down to the way you play. Others might find more use for the barrier and double attack spells, I hardly ever found any need for them.  Balance issues aside, it's a wonderful little game with nice music, and I hope to see more games from this developer, because they seem to have some unique ideas amongst them.",

            "review_text": "A turn-based strategy/puzzle rpg(?) that has a major focus on resource management. This game is extremely fun, and well worth the $5.  My main gripe with the game is how unexpectedly short it ended up being. After dying on wave 4, then 6, then 4 again, I figured out the main   torch -&gt; red stone   mechanic and didnt have a problem beating the game on that same run. After finishing it (with 90 mins of total playtime), I was disappointed to see that there is no 'hard mode' (besides playing without upgrades, which isnt that hard).  That being said, I got my $5 out of it and wouldn't mind coming back to this game if they added a 'new game+' difficulty, or another mode or something. I highly recommend, even though its short.",

            "review_text": "If you like the concept, you'll probably like the game. It's well-implemented in terms of resource management and intuitive to learn, if a bit simplistic. There are two issues that may detract from this. First, certain strategies are absolutely better than other strategies (not many, specifically the necessity of getting the torch then using the red orb to wipe the tier as opposed to clearing the wave). However, there's a great deal of flexibility in leveling skills, and some of the fun is finding which skills suit you best or work in different scenarios (I haven't done much testing to see if some skills are absolutely better than others, but if they are, it isn't as noticeable as the torch-orb strategy). Second, replayability is somewhat limited. There are three modes and a time-based score system, but the modes are very similar, and the score system isn't as effective as others I've seen (i.e. making the player want to get a higher score, though I'm not someone who usually pursues a higher score, so if you are, it might be better). That said, you'll absolutely get a few hours out of it. Considering the price, that's reasonable.",
