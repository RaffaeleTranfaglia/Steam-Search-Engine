            "review_text": "If you enjoyed 'Back in action' you'll enjoy this more. if you thought back in action had afew too many problems, this is basically the same game but with alot of the issues patched. i also reccomend starting with only blood as your squad, he honestly works best alone and if you will level quickly like that, this should give you an easier start if you know how to sneak (The pistol isnt too loud even unsilenced, and you can ambush the enemies. just dont aim for the head, just the torso.) if you do that, the start should be fairly easy and you should be able to enjoy the game. if you go for a large squad of rookies that dont know what they're doing, you will find yourself screaming at the screen as your 5 guys get killed by one enemy, and the game will seem horribly unbalanced. so really, how you experience the game determines on who you start out with. blood was personally my top merc in BIA and crossfire, if you leave him as a solo squad, he is very versitile and levels quickly, and you can cap towns with him while hiring more mercs for permanent defense duty. after you do that, the game should go fairly well, once you figure out the mechanics. its a hard game to learn at first, think of it as the chess of the virtual world, easy to lose and misunderstand at first, but you love it and get better every hour you put into it. also, dont be afraid to restart the game, how you start determines your entire run, and losing a merc if you use a solo merc as your main rather than a full squad can be game-ending. that said, its a very under-rated game that can bring alot of fun to a patient man, and alot of pain to the players of modernday generic shooters. if you dont maind waiting an enemy out for afew minutes, this will be fine. if you're too impatient and need constant action, id suggest you pass on the whole JA series.",

This expansion is quite shorter and easier than the JABiB with no improvement in AI (e.g. Enemies running on ladders on every occasion is too stupid).
