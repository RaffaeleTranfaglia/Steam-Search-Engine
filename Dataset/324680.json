Building your own custom units using animals. It's simple in base building but the real strategy is building the perfect units and being able to face any situation by land, sea, or air. The campaign may not be the most amazing thing ever but it adds an extra level in the army building. You actually have to find animals in the game and get DNA to unlock new animals. Not to mention seeing different unit sto give you ideas on how to build yours. In the end this is a classic RTS in my opinion and a must play for RTS fans and those who love creativity.",

I've been playing for almost 10 years and, even though I've been playing this long, this game almost never gets old! There is a seemingly endless amount of creature combinations that you can choose from to make as many varieties of armies as the heart desires, so you don't have to face off against the same enemies and use the same units every time you play. Also, there are tons of different maps to choose from, supporting endless amounts of player strategies and gamestyles. And if you aren't satesfied with the maps available, you can always hop on the game's 'Mission Editor' and create a map on your terms. The only real limiting factor of this game is the mind itself. And, if you still want more out of this game, it supports tons of different mods, like Tellurian for example.  I recommend to anyone who hasn't played this game or haven't even heard of it, to buy and give it a whirl. What have you got to lose?",

I have played a good 200 hours of this game due to the fact that I have had it since I was nine- probably even more hours. I love the diversity that this game has and that fact that it is a noob friendly RTS game for all you non gamers out there. It also can become pretty challenging if skirmishing against hard or expert bots(they have all sorts of map hacks and are good at micromanagement). I like that fact that you can create your own armies to match the style in which you play. I also love the 15 mission campaign that comes with it. Really fun and you can learn a lot by playing it. It is a decent story line. My most favorite part of the game, however, is the Mission Editor. You can make your own maps and missions. When I was younger I made many maps and had fun with the diversity. It is not too hard to use just make sure you make your scenarios folder in data then make an MP folder in scenarios and your set.The other good part is that the new steam version fixed the multiplayer. It is fun and easy to use so I totally recommend that you invite your freinds to play this game as well.",

But after reading other reviews and seeing the game's sense of humor I changed my mind and gave it a try.  The most fun is trying out different animal combinations for building armies. Unlike every other RTS I've ever played, this one might have the highest replayability possible, because all the units are customized. So rather than focusing on certain canned units like other RTS, it's hard to know if the units you've come up with are going to counter whatever someone else might throw at you.  The RTS has limited resources per map - so only so much coal will be available, although electricity can be converted into coal too.  The voice acting is fun and the learning curve keeps me coming back. The UI is dated. For example the ESC key is ignored and you have to hit the 'menu' button instead. I've only played a few hours and so far it's been worth the sale price of $2.99 for the game. Looking forward to trying some multiplayer games too.",
