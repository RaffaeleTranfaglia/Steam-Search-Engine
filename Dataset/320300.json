If you have the previous version of this game (Car Mechanic Simulator 2014) and you like it, I still recommend buying the new version since there is a significant update over last version: cars now have much more parts, engines and car bodies can be disassembled and repaired. Now in later stages of game you can buy cars, repair them and sell for profit. The game today also got a FREE content update in form of a new car to repair, the developers said there will be more free content updates. I as a car fan find this game really enjoyable and recommend this to everyone who is interested in cars.",

            "review_text": "I won't claim to know everything about cars, I would struggle to fix a car if someone gave me a step by step 'Fixing a car for dummies' book. That said, this is a good start for anyone remotely interested in fixing/repairing/replacing parts.   While there are some things I could criticize, like the 'instructions not clear enough - private parts stuck in engine block' tutorial, it's quite easy to get into and play with little hand-holding. The part repair system could use a little work imho, the paint shop seems a bit redundant at times, the auction camera needs a bit of fixing, and some other small things.  Overall for a game of this style, having that balance between a gearhead's game and a general indie style game is hard to get right. This game gets it right. It has enough depth and detail to actually make me stop and think about what I'm doing and what steps I should take to complete the repair, but not too much that I have to call my mechanic friends/family and ask them what I need to do.  The game is easy to get into and very fun to play, again balancing gameplay and detail/realism. The number of times I've had to replace a crankshaft after I've already taken apart the clutch housing and reassembled it......  There are a few things that needed work, but mostly just quality of life improvements that could be changed/added in a patch. No major problems to speak of.  I wish some of the 2014 features were there, like the sense of progression from a garage to a multi-car shop, or the 'replace the missing parts from my new used car purchase'.  Yes you will replace brakes a thousand times, yes you will change thousands of filters, yes you will find the same problems coming up time after time. This is the life of a mechanic. Cars need brakes, cars need new filters, mechanical things break, and often times it's the same things that break. I would recommend that you see the 'monotony' as a more realistic representation of how it is to fix cars in a shop. Your car will need new oil, it will need a new timing belt at least once in its life, it's just a fact to live with.  The thing I personally like, having recently gotten to that point, is once you can purchase a parking garage and go to the auto auction to purchase broken down piles of scrap, and turn them into like-new beauties to sell. The trailer/intro video shows this, starting with a car that may be missing half of the body, trying to repair as many parts as possible to save money, and buying what you can't fix. By the end you can decide whether to just replace the really bad parts, or completely renovate the body, engine, and suspension to brand new quality. It adds a sense of accomplishment to the end game (which some may say is desperately needed after changing 1000 brake pads), and keeps you playing.   TL;DR: It can be boring, but it's worth it to anyone even remotely interested in cars. Just buy it. (Though if still in doubt - wait for a sale, $20 USD may be a bit steep for some)",

            "review_text": "This game is basicly a open free play at game start. Your abilty in the game is outstanding, you gain experince points, having thoses points makes it possable to get things, you can take jobs or reject jobs, you can not only do auto repair, but go to the auction and get cars to restore. The game is not a auto training simulator, there are no software training simulators for auto mechanics, you would need to see a tech school for that because it is hands on training.   How ever the diganostics on the car for a failing part is on the mark for the most part of what got broken and needs to be replaced. If you never worked on a car ever, here you will get to see what the parts names are and were they go, so yeah it could be said you will learn the very basic bases of auto mechanics.  If your a mechnic who likes to play around with car repair games, a person who is into cars, anyone who is adicted to cars, I would recomend this game. Check out the guides section in the fourm and look for 'Auto Repair Manual Class for Car Mechanic Simulator 2015' Why this guide? Because at the very end of the guide at the bottom it has Tutorial Videos of the in's and out's of what is expected in the game and maybe of intresst to you to see what is going on in the game! They are sectioned off with titles on each video making it possable for you to choose what you want to see. Some vids may have more than one part, there was alot to cover..   Hope this helps..",

I have thouroghly enjoyed several new aspects of the game. The fact that the camera is easier to control and doesn't snap or go to awkward angles like it did in CMS 14 is a huge plus for me. I also love that you can take a motor alll the way down to the block and rebuild it. Heck you can strip the whole car down and rebuid, I'm loving how in depth they have gone with this new release. I only see the game getting better as they update and release DLC. If you love getting your hands dirty, at least virtually. This game is for you.",

Cons: -Gets repetitive -Quite easy, especially after you've taken apart every type of car, there is no challenge -No real management layer, 95% of games focus is on taking cars apart and putting them back together.  Explanation: As it stands it is a lot of fun especially if you like games like World of Guns or taking things apart, maybe learning something in the process, you will love this game. It can get repetitive after about 16h (I played more than 30 already and still have lots of fun), but it is actively developed and almost every week (and sometimes even more often) there is something new to see in the game and also after you explore all the content available at the moment game is still relaxing and fun so I find myself running it just to play for about half an hour, fix a car of two, and relax a little. I highly recommend this game. It is very well done technologically, constantly improved in terms of gameplay and replayability and has very good support and contact with the developer. Almost every thread on steam forums has a developer answer, and some of the suggestions were implemented in the game in literally few days from being first posted. If only more game developers were like creators of Car Mechanic Simulator 2015... ",

Cons: - some processes are not very intuitive, e.g. engine swaps (it works onoly with Performance DLC although there are parts for engine tuning in the core game, and there isn't any explanation or warning about that); - it has some skillpoint grind to do for upgrading the garage; - instruments on the dashboard are just textures; - driving physics is simplified, it doesn't give a real feel of the vehicle.",

In order to unlock additional content (i.e. slicker vehicles, shop improvements, and abilities) you'll have to turn the wrenches a lot longer in order to gain XP. This isnât entirely a bad thing, as I feel it keeps you coming back for more. The jobs seem to be more varied in both, substance and tasks in order to get you through. However, youâll see a lot of the same types of vehicles, early on, just in different colors. Despite that, I honestly canât find much more to complain about.

            "review_text": "The game in all is one of the few games that actually make me glad I am choosing to become a car mechanic in my future. This, although with a lot less of the frustration really working on a car can bring, is accurate, but only to an extent. As said by many people, itâs missing the human factor to it. From the âI canât touch anything or Iâll have to clean grease off itâ incident to the âIâve lost the one screw and will have to replace the whole partâ mistakes. Itâs also missing the whole electrical aspect of cars; it would be cool if they could have cars that you would work on that showed you just what the working of a smart car is like.    I would hope that in future updates it will allow:  -More car customization, such as different paint jobs (which can even be a part by itself where you have to paint each stencil/layer yourself) -Ability to work on the interior of the cars  -Ability to go to car shows and drive the car around and get awards and money  -As many car types as you can think of from all different car companies (Can give the ability of the player to load all or just some of the cars they want to work on) including different engine types  -Create a customer system where people come in and have their cars fixed within a certain time span (have the phone for people who have bigger projects and have the schedule on computer) It's unrealistic that people would wait to have their car fixed while I'm out at auction and fixing my own cars or just goofing around -System so that you can sell cars to not just people at auction, but do trades as well -Allow players to expand the shop, adding more lifts, open floor areas, and have the ability to hire people in your own shop to help with buying items, fixing parts, testing and painting cars, even buying /selling cars, and even having them take care of a project by themselves  -Different modes for players to choose from, such as casual (which is basically what the game is now), a career mode that would start with your business only getting a few costumers, would grow depending on the playerâs judgment, and would have ways of advertising and seeing how well you are doing  -Ability to add mods (which would help add new cars and different aspects while keeping the game itself simple and giving players the option to expand -Broken parts are not all rusted; parts can have breaks, malfunctions, be clogged but unnoticed until it is actually inspected  The game as it stands is a good time consumer and definitely helped me distinguish that not every part is called âthat round doohickeyâ or âthat thingâ due to that I have to look up every part individually by name in order to order a new one. Itâs a great educational tool that is easy to work with and understand. What I find absolutely amazing is that even with my slow computer I can run this game with no problem with high quality and only minimal lag with ultra high quality with the only problem just being mouse movement is slowed. I like that it is realistic in the aspect that if you spend all your money on a car you wonât have enough to buy parts to get more money or fix the car and will eventually have to chop shop a car. What is nice is that the game is still being updated and actively worked on.   Itâs a game where sometimes I canât stop until Iâve made enough money or until Iâve gotten down to only one customer but then I realize that I have parts to fix, then that I should sell some things, then that there is another customer. But wait, itâs a different car I havenât worked on. Now I have to find the parts that need to be replaced because they are located everywhere or it has a V8 OHV engine and all the rods and rocker arms need to be taken out. But then Iâve made the mistake of once again not going to bed when I wanted to. It feels like a Billy Mays commercialâ¦ âBut wait! Thereâs more!â  Overall, Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 is an amazing game. I would even be willing to pay for updates such as the ones Iâve listed because just one of those alone will bring hours of more fun, discovery, and things to learn about.",

While the systems and jobs are quite accurate and in depth I think they could have implemented more diagnostic tools, the scan tool is a cool tool but if they could implement a fully functioning scan tool where you can look up and clear DTCS I think that would produce a whole new level of experience in the game for experienced players. After pretty much going through the whole game in expert mode its a fun challenge that keeps you glued to the screen. Overall a great game for what it is, and has a lot of potential.",

At the time of this review I'm only a few hours into it but already I notice some things I would like to see added for extra realism. For example, hoses (air, radiator and others) battery cables and other major wires, various fluids like washer, brake, transmission etc. and gaskets in the engine would be a nice touch.   Something else that would help with the immersion would be to have different size wrenches and sockets with ratchets to use on different size bolts and nuts.   I think it's important to have a lot of different parts for the different cars as most cars take different parts in real life; at least for the larger more important parts. That would be nice to have to look up the make/model in the computer to get the right part. :) Honestly I don't think it wouldn't be that hard to add that if only they added part numbers to the car part inventory. Finally I would like to see options of stock, upgraded and high performance parts so you can upgrade the cars you buy. Overall though the game has potential to take many hours of fun and learning.

            "review_text": "There are quite a lot of pros and only a few cons to the game. Mind you, I will be comparing the older version to the newer version.  Pros: -It is not very laggy: The biggest issue I had with the older version was that I set my game to the lowest video settings, but I still kept on lagging. This game takes that and throws it in the bin. With the same computer and same specs, the 2015 version was much more smoother than the 2014 version. I had at least 30fps all the way, whereas I would have 15-20fps on the 2014 version.  -Interesting Campaign Mode: The one in CMS2014 was very controlled, you were given the same puzzle as everyone else who played the game. This gives you the choice to select the orders you want to take, and that is a game changer. No longer do you HAVE to do an order. You get to pick what you want to do. i.e I don't feel like fixing that guy's brakes, so I'll just select the order with the engine problems instead. This helps to make the game much more smoother and much more playable. -Much fewer glitches: I had a problem with CMS2014, and that was my order #43 glitched and I couldn't finish the order no matter how closely I followed the instructions. Since this is a newer game, we don't have as many glitches anymore. This game is being constantly updated, so it allows for improvement all the time.  -Cool DLCs: We have had two DLCs come out by the time I am writing this review, Visual Tuning and Young Timer. Young Timer is free, with the nice little Fiat 500 lookalike. The Visual Tuning DLC does cost some money, however it is much more cheaper compared to the price tags on the other DLCs.   Cons: -Time Consuming: Unless you are an absolute car bore who likes fixing the cars in this game like I do, you are not going to have a fun time. This is a simulator of what mechanics do on a daily basis, so ofcourse it is going to be time consuming, what did you expect?  -Unlockables: In CMS2014, we had the OBD scanner as a tool since the beginning of the game. Why do we need to work on 10 cars maximum in order to unlock the tool that we had for a long time in the previous game? They could've let some tools remain like they were in the previous game. However, it does add for an interesting aspect to the gameplay, because now you get to work for the things you really want. Although that is interesting to me, it might not be to the other gamers.  -Repair Uncertainty: Now again, unless you are a car enthusiast that finds these innovations interesting to the gameplay, you are probably not going to like the fact that there is a chance that the item you repair may not be fixed successfully.   Overall, I think they did an excellent job with the new 2015 simulator. The new additional features are absolutely worth every single penny of that price tag. This new game completely demolishes the other older one, and I am not saying this because my CMS2014 Order #43 did not work. I genuinely believe this new game is a huge step forward from the previous one. I can now only imagine how much greater the 2016 version will be, definitely a rival to the upcoming Street Tuning Revolution. I am only joking, that game is a total in depth tuning game and it will take Red Dot Games a little while to catch up to that level, eventhough in my opinion it is very close. Then again, I have not played Street Tuning Evolution yet, so I can't tell the gap there might exist between the two games. CMS2016, that is a game definitely to look forward to.  ",

            "review_text": "I've played about a hundred hours on this game. I've never been one to RACE thru a game at a RECORD pace, and this one was no exception. It took me about 90 hours to get to the point where I had all the tools and upgrades, and could afford the parking lot, the final purchase required to buy cars at auction (the only way to OWN your own cars).  I haven't read thru the community forums much. In the beginning, I needed to go to YouTube to find videos on how to find the parts in some of the cars, such as the fuel pump (located on top of the fuel tank, btw ...), and it took me awhile to figure out how the color scheme works with each mode, as they change depending on whether you're in DISASSEMBLE mode, ASSEMBLE or a third mode you can use to diagnose the condition of the parts.  Once you get it, it's a piece of cake to figure out the order of taking the car apart and putting it back together.  I also bought the DLC, but I haven't seen much in the way of custom parts yet, other than RIMS and PAINT. In fact, that brings me to my WANTS, or things that would make this game better.  1. Why not be able to take the cars out and drive them around a city or RACE TRACK? The one little test course is a quick set of bumps and turns thru an alley, and gets old really quick.  2. The addition of tracks or courses would make improving your car more exciting, and maybe motivate you to build it with 100% new condition parts. As it is, you really need to have a junker to tell any difference in performance from car to car. Beefing up the UPGRADE system would be nice, too. Souping up the motor and suspension, or TURBO and NITROUS kits would make shaving times off a time trial a lot of fun, and give you some reason to stay with the game after you get to where I am, where everything gets a little tedious.  3. For me it's hard to understand why you can repair CERTAIN partz at certain times, but not others. You end up with hundreds of broken partz that you have to sell one by one, mouse CLICK and ENTER. When selling stuff, the sound of my keyboard and mouse is like an old manual typewriter. You can sell the 'JUNK' with one button, but anything above 10% condition gets thru that filter. And its all junk if you can't repair it, unless you want to build cars out of damaged partz.  4. What about a reputation system? The cheaper, better, and faster you repair carz should bring you more trusting and higher paying customers. As it is, you select cars from a list, by clicking on a phone. Rather sterile, and boring after a while.  5. Also, I don't know about the value of the cars. There may be a list somewhere, but I haven't seen it. Makes auctions a little silly if you can't tell the sale value of the car before bidding.  6. How about some RACING WHEEL support, along with the tracks or city driving? These muscle cars BEG to be driven hard, not just crashed and trashed in an alley with KEYBOARD controls. It would be fun to drive thru downtown traffic, pull in to a RACE TRACK, and race against AI cars or your friends. OPEN and CLASS races would be fun, and could also add to the FAME of your CUSTOM shop when you win, or just show up and race a lot.  That's it, for now, MotorKatz! I obviously liked the game, but I don't feel like it has enuff depth to keep me interested, as it stands now. Like any good game, it has left me wanting more!  Good Luck!  Jack",

That being said after all that I was in the mood to finally give this game a shot but I can't really call this a simulator because I wasn't busting my knuckles on things, getting my hands covered in something that probably causes a cancer known to the state of California, losing tiny parts and yelling curse words, that would make even a sailor blush, for all my neighbors to hear. I'm pretty sure anyone who has worked on a car knows what I'm talking about; if you really want to get to know what a person is really like inside have them work on a car.  On a serious note though I think the game is pretty cool and refreshingly different but as someone who works on his own cars I have to say this is more of a puzzle game than a simulator but still intriguing if you're interested in the internal workings of a car; I can see how this game would be super interesting for someone who hasn't much experience working on cars.  Maybe I just haven't got far enough into the game yet but the cars seem rather barren and the engine compartment isn't a dizzing array of hoses, pipes and wires like in real life. Also why is oil disposal $100? Maybe it's just where I live where you can dispose of oil for free at any auto parts store or a county waste site, but it's probably just one of those gameplay balancing things.  One thing I do like is being able to go on the computer ingame and then finding and ordering parts from fictitious websites. It's not a biggie but a nice touch I think.  My only real complaint is the music which is pretty much, so far, nothing but the wub wub wub kind of dubstep. Being a car mechanic themed game I would expect something a little more blue collar like rock or blues but that's okay; I opted to turn the music off and listen to my own music so it's not that big of a deal.  One suggestion for the developers: Make a more detailed version of this game in VR with the Vive controllers. That would be awesome!",

The first large chunk of this game will be occupied by repair jobs, where you will be required to find broken parts in the car and fix them. When enough experience and money is gathered, the real fun begins when you can purchase your own cars, then restore them and either sell them, or keep them for your own personal collection. The DLC for this game is fairly priced, but is not necessary to enjoy the game. Anyone who has an interest in cars, or just wants to learn more about cars should certainly pick up this game.

Instead of using the ratchet sounds add in some power tool sound fx! Like the impact wrench and an air wratchet! These would make the game even more enjoyable!  Also custom paint jobs woud be really cool as well! Something where you could have a set of custom designs the customer would like to put on their car and paint it in the paint booth!

There's a bit of help at first so you get familiar with general locations of where car parts are. For example i know in most models i have to remove the starter before i can remove the gearbox (which requires lift, starter doesn't). I had the hardest time finding the spark plugs but then i learned that the stars next to the part description will highlight things in blue.

Buy the rust bucket, strip it down completely, refurbish or buy new parts, spray it any color you want, test drive it, and just keeps going. You get experience as you are taking each piece off, granted it\\'s only 1 XP per part, but you use that experience to gain upgrades to how fast you unbolt/bolt parts together, disassemble, a tablet so you don\\'t have to keep running back to the computer, and a few other things. You also use this experience to unlock new areas of the shop. You gain money for completing a job order, use that and the experience to unlock parts of the shop. The money is also good to gain for cars at the auction, when you\\'re experienced enough you can get yourself a parking garage to store your cars. The DLC\\'s add such a great taste to it for all types of gearheads out there, whether you are into sporty cars or muscles, maybe even trucks.

            "review_text": "Car Mechanic simulator is a TON of fun. I've lost more than a few hours playing this game (a lot of offline hours not counted at time of review here). I'd strongly recommend this to anyone who has an interest in learning about cars, but doesn't have an extra car they can risk working on. Here's a quick list of pros and cons of the game:  Pros: - Great concept and parts. You get work with a lot of really deep and interesting parts on a surprising number of different car models. - Great progression. For the most part, the game starts you off with an easy fix (outer tie rods, brake pads, calipers, etc), and then builds up the difficulty by making you diagnose the problem, and giving you the tools and education to make that diagnosis. - Impressive graphics. Nothing stunning, but for a game of this caliber, it's got great visuals for hundreds of different car parts. - GREAT with Steam Controller. Load up a good Config, and have a blast. -Educational. Seriously, this game taught me a lot more about cars than I would've imagined. It won't turn you into a master mechanic, but it may help give you an idea of what's going wrong with a car, and maybe even give you the motivation to look up some How-To videos on youtube.  Cons: - Restrictive. The game deals almost exclusively with the engine, suspension, and exhaust, and the only fluid you'll encounter is an oil change. While that's not too bad, I would've loved to see some involvement with a vehicle's AC system. Additionally, it doesn't take into account steering, brake, or transmission fluids, or well-placed oil which is a little disappointing. - Unrealistic. In this game, you can pop off an Outer Tie Rod with a single screw- don't try doing that in real life, or you'll find yourself calling for a tow truck. While I understand the appeal to fun, a lot of parts just have this overwhelming sense of easiness about removing/replacing them. - Occasionally frustrating. The green/yellow/red outlines for parts can be a help, or a big hinderance when trying to figure out what part needs to be removed before the piece you've selected. While it's not a bad system by any means, it's in desperate need of some alternative options. Also, I don't know what car the Maluch was modeled after, but I hope the factory that made it burns down. - Lack of customization. All of your upgrades concern either improving your maintenance speed (why?) or adding OBD/Compression/Electronic testers. You can unlock a paint shop, test path and parking lot, but your garage is never given any real options to make it feel like home. - Lack of endgame. In a perfect world, you'd combine this game and, a decent racing game. While fixing a car, or filling your lot with top-of-the-line beauties is nice, it's hard to get excited when there's not much room to have any fun with them. All this horsepower, and no room to gallop!  All in all, CMS2015 is a lot of fun. If you're on the fence, wait until one of it's awesome sales roll around. It's definitely worth $20, and the DLC (aside from the Maluch) are all worth checking out.",

My main challenge now is keeping in mind that I am not actually a real life mechanic, so I shouldn't start buying broken down husks to restore them on my free time.  In my eyes, it only has two problems. First, the music does get pretty repetitive after a while; you can fix it by running Spotify or whatever in the background. Second, and more importantly, after a while I started to want even more detailed disassembly. Right now, for instance, engine rooms are almost too tidy; there are no tubes and almost no fluid containers. Why is there no brake fluid to disconnect before removing the calipers? And why are steering knuckles and brake dust shields combined into the same part?  On the other hand, I had no idea what any of those things meant before I started playing this game, so yeah.",

And here's why i love this game so much:  Story: You're a car mechanic and you fix'em cars.  Presentation: This game didn't really go for photorealism despite being a simulator, and some parts look really funky at times, but most of the time it doesn't really matter because this game runs really smooth and you don't need a beast to run this very smoothly so good optimaztion there. And mostly i didn't really cared about funky looking parts because i had so much fun. Oh, i almost forgot to talk about how much detail and effort has put into this game. You will be surpised to see how detailed the car parts are even thorugh they didn't went for the photorealism.  Gameplay: Gameplay in this game is so addicting and fun for both car lovers and problem solvers, so in the first few jobs the game tells you what to fix, but 3-4h in the game gives less infomation about the problem and you need to dig(or shall i say, screw) your way into the car to find the problem and replace it with new parts. Also this game really teaches you about car parts and how to remove them and put'em back in. It is a very fun and addicting IF you're a car lover like me or a problem solver, novice mechanic, or people who like puzzle games. Well if you're not one of those people i suggest stay away from this game because it's not for you.  Overall: Overall this game is perfect for Car lovers, problem solvers, novice mechanic, and people who like puzzle games. For those people this game gets 9/10 BUY THIS GAME NOW. But if you're not one of those people do not purchase this game. I myself would put a recommended review because this game deserves more positive reviews.",

This is crazy addictive if you are into the mechanics of a car. The auction is probably a favorite for me. Buy the rust bucket, strip it down completely, refurbish or buy new parts, spray it any color you want, test drive it, and just keeps going. You get experience as you are taking each piece off, granted it\\'s only 1 XP per part, but you use that experience to gain upgrades to how fast you unbolt/bolt parts together, disassemble, a tablet so you don\\'t have to keep running back to the computer, and a few other things. You also use this experience to unlock new areas of the shop. You gain money for completing a job order, use that and the experience to unlock parts of the shop. The money is also good to gain for cars at the auction, when you\\'re experienced enough you can get yourself a parking garage to store your cars. The DLC\\'s add such a great taste to it for all types of gearheads out there, whether you are into sporty cars or muscles, maybe even trucks. They thought of everyone when making the DLC\\'s for this game. Granted there are no name brand vehicles for legal reasons I assume. Still, the cars are nice.

            "review_text": "Other people have said this before but this isn't really a sim. This is more of a puzzle game involving various car and engine parts. The great thing about it is that there are several types of engines to fix, each with there own unique parts. Fixing them is a lot of fun but the thing i like the most about it is buying cars at an auction and completely restore it and then sell it for big profits. It takes a while to get enough experience and buy the upgrades necessary to do so but its a lot of fun. One car consist out of so many parts and it can be a little tricky when you disassemble them and replace all the defective parts.   The only downside to this game are the long loading times (considering the game has to load a lot of parts) and even on a PC that exceeds way above the minimum specs may take a several moments. All in all, this doesn't form much of a problem to me.   Another thing i don't like is the music in this game. It's all dubstep and its like listening to a 56k modem making musical tones. Luckily, it can be turned off so that you can play your own music.   All in all, its a great game and the DLC adds new features and cars. Currently, there's a Mercedes-Benz DLC that adds the 300 SL Gullwing and the 560 SEC. There are more real life cars to come, now that the developers acquired the license for Maserati. Can't wait!",

I find myself perpetually visiting the site in order to see what new features and DLCs are available to satisfy this newly created obsession of putting wonderful machines together in different ways that I could never hope to afford on a garbage man's salary.   When I first purchased Car Mechanic Simulator 2015, it was one of those titles on my wishlist that I'd hoped would finally give me enough of that car-mod junkie fix I was looking for. My feelings might be mixed on that one though. I played a game called Street Legal Racing (Redline) for a while that allowed you to put some cars together, but was extremely limited without the plethora of User Mods available out there (unfortunately, they cause the game to crash as often as -insert expletive here). What it did do right however, was the customizeability, and a nod to the racing genre if you felt like pursuing the in-game 'game'.  Ok, let's start with what CMS 2015 is not. It is not a 'Need For Speed' clone, and that is Ok. As titillating as the prospect of racing a hard worked, hard earned car is around a fictional NÃ¼rburgring facsimile with 15 sirens blaring in the background, I am of the mind that even with a AAA budget, you can either do one thing or the other very well but not both. CMS 2015 focuses on the simulatory aspects of building up your virtual baby with a level of detail that pleases and surprises.   You start out with a workshop and some car repair jobs to choose from. As you progress, you gain some cash and leveling points that you can spend on equipment and such. Without delving into too many details so as to stay on point, you get to purchase or fix different components ranging from the suspension to the engine and really get into the 'nuts and bolts' of things. After 20 or so hours and a real sense of accomplishment, I felt myself wishing that I could get even further detail into the parts I was dealing with.   I was satisfied with changing things like cylinder heads and screwing on the bolts, but I kind of felt like 'where is the head gasket?' That pesky thing that once caused me an overdraft and a scolding from my manager for coming in late. Another thing I desperately wanted, was to take Mr. Bean's car and drop some American V8 muscle in it with 21 inch rims and a boeing wing for downforce. Unfortunately and inexplicably, you can't! It seems to me that the foundations of the game are solid enough to support this though and I do really hope to see something like this very soon.   In conclusion, the aspects that are included are very well polished. The assortment of cars work as unique puzzles that need specific pieces to fit in the right order and give you a greater appreciation than the sum of their parts. Yet, more detailed problems can be fleshed out to create greater challenges, as well as interesting combinations that could increase the longevity of the game (not to mention better custom modding) by leaps and bounds.  Either way, I want more!",

The game boils down to an interactive set of 3d car models. These models allow you to disassemble and reassemble engines, drive trains, and so on. This is definitely neat, but in itself only has so much enjoyment before things get repetitive.   The illusion of running a repair shop almost works but the finer points of running a business are completely lost. There are always more customers waiting, no matter how long you take, or how poorly you did. Diagnosing problems seems almost trivial, just look for rusty components as you wrench things apart. I want to like this, but I ran out of challenges a while ago. All that remains is the grind of XP and money.  This game needs more of something. I would personally love to see engine tuning and performance simulated to some degree. Other options would be expanding the business model of running a repair shop, or perhaps adding more realism to the repairs themselves. A broken part isn't just a rust texture after all.",

And coming from that to this, everything just felt a bit too simple, a bit too automated and a bit too 'spoon fed'. I'll admit I haven't played this for long, but I've played it for long enough to see how it could get repetitive.  The thing that immediately turned me off is how everything is just automated. I feel like the experience would be a lot more immersive if you had to physically move parts, and generally if the jobs you recieved were longer as a result of this, but more rewarding as a trade off.  If you're looking for something similar, but will give you something that has more of a sense of value than an XP/Cash number by the time you're done with it, check out My Summer Car.",

I gave up entirely on even playing this game when I realized that to unlock anything extra (Buy and fix old cars, test the cars, or even anything for the garage) would take an extra 9,000 xp. Would recommend this for people who don't know how to change their oil and want to do that for at least five hours, or for people who don't know how a hydraulic lift works. Other than that this game is very beautiful and has some good mechanics to it, but again feels to go a little slow, it might just be me but, I would recommend waiting until this game has some solid updates that add a bunch cars and garage upgrades to buy it.",
