    "description": "Luminosity is a fast paced arcade game. You take the control of a space ship and your objective is to close off the enemy drones and conquer a certain percent of the map in order to blow them up. Things quickly escalate and you face an increasing number of unique and challenging enemies and environments all trying to destroy your laser...",

            "review_text": "Pick your favorite area-clearing paddle game... Qix, JezzBall... my personal favorite is Ambrosia Software's Barrack for Macintosh computers back in the 90s. Anyway, this game is a pretty good one of those. A variety of enemies and powerups keep things fresh, and gameplay can be pretty challenging at times. My play sessions always end up being longer than expected. I wish the playfield was a little bigger, because I feel the UI wastes a lot of space. Other than that, no major complaints. Fun game!",

            "review_text": "This game is a take on the Qix-derivated subgenre perfected by Ambrosia Software with their wonderful Barrack game on the Macintosh. It differs from the latter in the fact that you capture areas but can't destroy the enemies held within in any manner. The game grants invulnerability to your paddle/ship as a trade-off - only your laser can be hurt. In all honesty, it felt a bit limited to me. The boss mechanic (a ship you have to lure away, as it is trolling you) is also a tad obnoxious and not particularly interesting in my opinion. On the bright side, the developper put in a lot of ideas, which might help in the long run, but might also hurt the score-attack aspect of the game, as the levels are randomly generated and some can be quite unfair. The visual design is not that great either.  But seeing the lack of alternative for that particular genre, I recommend it, 'slightly'. If only Barrack were to be revived, some day, maybe...",

            "review_text": "A land-grab style game where you use your mouse to shoot lines to bisect the area. If an area has no enemies inside, you claim it. If your line is hit by an enemy before it finishes extending to both ends, you lose a life. You win once you get enough territory (usually ~66%).  Campaign is 36 stages that you can 3-star and you unlock ships for arcade mode by clearing them. Arcade mode is a score attack where you complete levels that increase in difficulty until you run out of lives.  Arcade mode makes more use of the game's offerings than campaign. Unless I missed a mechanic, crystals in campaign are so rare (they only show as a powerup in a few levels and they don't carry over) that the powerup-purchasing part of the game is pointless when you're not in one of those levels. In arcade you can slowly save up across levels so you can stockpile them there.  There are multiple ships to use (you can change ship in arcade but not in campaign) that play a little differently because they mix up line speed, lives, and simple abilities.  There are also ship upgrades that you can spend gold on (but I got no gold for completing the campaign). Ship upgrades are linked to arcade mode (arcade mode gives gold, use gold to upgrade your ship, get farther in arcade mode, higher score means more gold).  The upgrades that are possible are really influential on your high score because they are things like more max lives (up to 10? more, and you start at max lives), chance to gain a life when clearing a stage (up to 50%?), chance to ignore getting hit (up to 30%?), increased laser speed (up to 30%?), and increase power-up spawn rate (up to 50%?). So to really get your high score you'll need to grind thousands of arcade gold through dozens of playthroughs.  Worth a look if you like land-grab games like Fortix 2 or like testing your ability to keep track of enemies and the path your line will take. It can be tough to shoot a line through a sea of enemies that are moving around.  Other thoughts:    There's a bug in campaign: If you spam click as you beat a level then quickly move to the next level, you can start the next level with a free line. Doesn't work when retrying levels, only in campaign mode.    The game doesn't seem to work offline.    When you lose it drags on for a few moments too long. Wouldn't be so bad if you could skip the 'cutscene' of you breaking apart into pieces. It doesn't really matter in arcade mode (because you have multiple lives and clear a lot of levels before each retry) but in campaign mode you might have to repeat the save level multiple times.    I liked the shield ship the most because being able to block enemies approaching your line is incredibly useful.    Seems a lot easier when you can start with a good bisect (instead of slowly and painstakingly shaving away the edges) so I'd spend my first few shots going for something big.    It feels like you need to shoot from the middle so that the lines reach the edges faster (reducing the time you're vulnerable). It would be interesting if half of your line became invulnerable once it hit the wall (so you could lean towards one side and reduce vulnerability time on one side while increasing the other) but that doesn't seem to be the case.
