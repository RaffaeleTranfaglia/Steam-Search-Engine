            "review_text": "Bought this game in sale and you know what? It's very solid.  I was looking into some action adventure, this game looked interesting enough and the toon effect reminds me to borderland so.. why not? Result: wasn't expecting much but this game impressed me a lot. Nice atmosphere, the action plays better then expected, using the blade is fun and the puzzles are very well done. Cons? The graphic has style but maybe not the best (at least not the usual 2D game) but I think is more then enough.  Many people wrote that the walking is slow.. it's sure not fast but for me it's super ok. Btw: it runs also with my super cheap GPU so that's also cool.",
