Time. What more could you want?  Very creative and entertainingly random/absurd, Shutshimi is an enjoyable game to play through. The controls are responsive, the art-style - as well as music - are awesome, the replay value is very high, and it's also even more fun to play with friends &amp; family with co-op!  And it has hats. And butts.  Highly recommended for shmup/party/rougelike fans! It's SERIOUSLY SWOLE!",
