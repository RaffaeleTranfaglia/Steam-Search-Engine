            "review_text": "This game has the seed of a potentially good idea (online auto-moderated salon-style LARP - never mind that 'online' and 'LA*' are contradictory). However, the execution on that idea is irredeemably flawed. There are three major things lacking: - game size: the free instances are typically limited to 5-6 players, and zero NPCs; it looks like premium scenarios are the same scenarios, with roughly doubled instance sizes. The available scenarios all feel like they would start to get interesting at around 20 players - environmental interaction: Every player starts the game with 2-5 items (which are always the same items in a given scenario, though the character/item match does get shuffled). There are not any other items in the game. There is a big yacht to walk around on, but there's never any reason to. Games tend to devolve quickly into everyone standing around in the same conversation, at which point the setting might as well be a stopped elevator. - depth of plot: Since everything that exists or can exist within the instance starts out in the hands of a small group of people, and nothing happens in the environment, the possible interactions within a scene are usually exhausted inside of 5 minutes. This makes the remaining 25 minutes until the scene actually *ends* (always by the clock running out) quite tedious.  There are also small but crucial mistakes, such as the murder mystery scenario always giving the same piece of evidence to the killer. Figure out what that is, and the mystery becomes really simple: each player has one piece of evidence, so whoever has that one, or refuses to share what they have, must be the killer.",

RPers: These are the people who take the game seriously and play the game how the developers intended it to be played. You're on a boat, with a bunch of strangers, and you've gotta outwit them to survive. Playing with this type of player is fun and (on occasion) rather intense.  Trolls: These... these players... Hoo boy. Trolls are everywhere, ♥♥♥♥♥, youtube and apparently also in the world's most unplayed and half decent game. They generally walk about, throwing their objectives overboard and going completely nuts. They can be categorized into 2 groups: Serious trolls, and spammers. The serious trolls are actually pretty funny. You get some who will even troll as the character, bringing a crude humor to the game. The spammers will simply talk nonsense.

You usually can't go wrong with free, and this game gives a decent amount of replayabilty since the free scenario changes, it offers variety also with other players and having a different role in the scenario.  You wont ever get the same playthrough twice, since evryone will act different with Trust and roles and whatnot.

Each player assumes the role of a different character - each with their own background story, motives and goals. You enter a scenario not knowing exactly how it will play out. You are encouraged to interact with the other players to discover the mystery .  I give this game a Recommended simply because I believe in the potential that it has. And with enough feedback, the developers can turn this into a really fun experience. I have enjoyed each scenario I have played regardless of the problems the game faces. However, take note of the issues I mention below before purchasing anything.   To see some gameplay and some of the issues I have mention in action - check out the below video:   Velvet Sundown Gameplay Video   Unfortunately, the game needs work before it can reach its full potential. Currently the game suffers from many problems, but none that can't be fixed in future versions.   There is a definite problem with AFK users that cause many paths in the story to never be completed.   The game sort of throws you in without doing much explaining which leaves many first time players confused. So then they spend their time asking 'What am I supposed to do?' instead of roleplaying. A more detailed tutorial would be helpful.",

Join a new game as one of many randomly selected characters, each with their own unique backstory and set of missions to complete. Interact with other players in open chat as you attempt to solve your missions and complete the game. Each game session is designed to last about 45 minutes, and millions of game possibilities exist, making each game truly unique.  I personally found this game to be pretty fun and well thought out, you don’t find many games quite like this. Even though there may sometimes be some annoying players who go afk or players who don’t actually role play, it is still a really good experience that everyone should give it a try. Because it is free you might as well take a look into it and if you really enjoy it, you can pay for a premium version which allows you to play a new scenario called “Story of Fathers and Sons”.  Overall I recommend it and that everyone should give it a try.",

Exiting the game is disabled during the duration of the scenario. Someone eventually Alt-F4ed out, which means the scenario couldn't have been completed even without Young Cheezy over there bothering everyone.  The other players were trying to figure the game out, but all in all it felt very awkward. Not sure if it was because I'm an introvert (and was already wanting to leave after the first 10 minutes of trying to socialize, either way), or because I couldn't really get into an acting/RPing mindset, or maybe a little of both. Tried engaging a couple people in conversation, trying to hide my character's 'true identity' and find out their roles, but no conversation ever really went past small talk. :-P  Highlight was when I 'did drugs' with someone -- which completed one of my secondary objectives, actually.    Novel idea for a game, regardless! I can't stress that enough! I loved the idea behind it!   Velvet Sundown would probably be an absolutely epic experience for the right audience (imaginitive RPers; mystery fans; theater buffs; etc.),  especially  among a group of friends.

It can be ruined by afk players and there aren't many options as to how to play. Needs significant improvement -laggy, not many options, only one storyline a week.

To pull their parachutes, the skydivers have to solve the puzzle. But, twist, sometimes there's two puzzles. Or three. Or four. Any you have no idea what pieces are for what puzzle.  What Velvet Sundown ends up being is hours of just handing people drinks, or collecting passports, or following a guy around. Then, once in every few days, you get a perfect combination of role, scenario, objective, and character, and you wreck shop. You solve your puzzle and pull your ripcord, and laugh as the others paint the ground below you. Laugh your way right to the bank.  I think everyone should *TRY* Velvet Sundown, because it's free.

Then you can work together or take advantage of the people around you. If you don't put in an effort and instead expect the game to be fun on its own, then you're probably not going to have a good time. This is not like most games.  You can't join a game and expect there to be an experience, and since this game's community has a problem with people joining only to be afk, which in this game is a seriously annoying problem, sometimes you'll have to play an entire 30 minute round with only a few people, which really ruins the entire round.   There are also a lot of small issues. Controls are a bit clunky, which is mostly fine, but still annoying. If you're playing the free version, you are limited to one scenario, which means you're missing out on a third of the game. I'm not sure if paying the subscription fee is worth it, unless you're really dedicated. I think they said they're going to rethink this, but I'm honestly not sure.  This is going to be a really strange comparison, but I'm going to compare the game a bit to DayZ. Most of the fun is from your experiences with the players. The world and tools alone aren't all that interesting, and if you just buy DayZ without having any idea what it's about, explore the world a bit, ignore everyone else, and die, then you're going to have a pretty miserable experience. Where games like DayZ shine is the golden moments like, I dunno, staying alive wounded in a cabin with your friend, desperately hoping that you won't get hurt and the stranger outside the window isn't there to kill you. Few games give you that experience.  The issue with Velvet Sundown is that experiences like that don't happen as often. My first round was destroyed because there was only two other players actually playing. There were three people afk, making playing the actual game impossible. My second round went better, but afk players still meant that the round didn't play out properly. My third game was amazing, where I played a doublecrossing thief who made money off of working together with an alliance, then backstabbing them in favour of a second alliance. It was a great experience, but I'm not sure if that was worth one and a half hour of waiting and hoping that the afk players would come back to life. I have 2 hours of gameplay in this game, and I've only played these three games.  I'm not recommending this game, because the average person browsing this page because they saw Cr1tikal or Giant Bomb or whatever playing this game is NOT going to enjoy this game. It's free, but I don't think this is worth it for you. You really need to put a bit of yourself into it to make a good experience, and that's not something people are used to.",

Not a whole lot of people play this game anymore, and I'm guessing I know why. The idea is to work with or against your fellow players to figure out who-dun-it, or try to accomplish your character's goals whilst on the ship.   There are a lot of times you'll get lucky and you'll get some AMAZING people who role play and pretend they are their character. Playing the game as it's intended to be played. Those games are what makes me come back and play it again.   Then you have the little kids....ahhhh, kids. Ruining video games 1 curse worded mouth at a time. I can't tell you how many times I've joined a game and had someone spam letters at me, curse at me, pretty much bullying other people, racism across ALL races, spewing out garbage from their tiny little pea brain mouths. I've also had many join just so they can disconnect purposely the moment they get in the game. This tends to ruin the game, especially if they have an item on them that you need, or if you need to hand them an item to complete a goal of yours.   I also think the fact that when you win or lose, there really isn't much of a difference. You don't win anything like costumes or new characters. You don't even get a 'you win!' spammed across your screen. So, winning doesn't give you that 'YEAH!' feeling like other games do. I think that is why there are so many trolls on this game who can't keep their attention on the actual game. Then you also get a lot of people who try to cyber with you and use the game as a way to ERP. Gross.   Overall, I think it would be a great game if there was a way to weed out the kiddos from being able to get on, or even a report system to report people who purposely d/c or try and curse you out with every curse in the book. Maybe if it linked up to your actual steam account and banned you through steam, maybe that would fix the issue, but then again...there is already a lack of people as it is, I feel like if that happened then there would be even less.   PROS: It's fun when played as intended. Good little time waster, fun little rpg, strategy based game. Text to speech. Who doesn't love text to speech??  CONS: The lack of missions, having to pay to be able to play the other two missions when nobody plays anymore, the kids, the fact that when a player d/cs it ruins your game (they should make it so if someone leaves and has an item on them you should have some sort of 'D/c taser' that tases your items off their person. That way it doesn't snow ball and so people don't d/c shortly after that one person because, let's be honest, it always snowballs into that. =/ Did I mention the kids who play? Yeah...Let's not get me started on those guys.   Did I mention the kids that play? Oh, right. I did..........grrr.  If this game had more (enjoyable) people on it, or more people in general...and a report system...I'd say this game would be fun. I still play it, but I always find myself quitting the moment those little brats start popping out of the wood work so if we had the option to report I think I could safely say that I'd recommend this game to a friend. I believe as it stands right now, if a friend asked me about this game, I'd tell them to try it once but expect the worst from it even though it can be fun.  I always hate giving bad reviews, especially when I still continue to play the game with my friend, but I'd have to say that I give this game a 4/10 in its current game state. If everything I mentioned above was taken care of I could safely say this would be a 6 to a 8. But I can't give it anything higher than a 4 right now and I definitely have to say I wouldn't recommend it to a friend unless they asked about it. Even then, that'd be pushing it. Sorry =/",

I joined a murder queue and tabbed out, coming back an hour later when the game had enough people to join, but it was definately worth it. We started off trading evidence and we had a whole group conversation where eveyrone spoke one at a time about their opinions. Thanks to the layout of the evidence, it just so happened that I was the only one that didn't have any evidence against them (And no, I wasn't the murderer) so I ended up being the Detective and piecing together the evidence. I had private conversations with everyone one at a time where they all gave their alibis. In the end, I had gave my vote on the murderer, and everyone else eventually began to side with me, and it turns out we were completely wrong. Regardless, we all had a quick laugh and an exchange of 'GG's in the post-game chat before leaving.  Never before have I seen such a friendly community.",

I highly recommend this game if you like to be insulted while they lie and say they're someone else and when you find out you don't know whether to feel bad or not and it leads into them stabbing you multiple times telepathically and then wake up feeling great and tell them how much you love them and they say you have a baby d i c k boner because you said their head looked like the runway in an airport",
