            "review_text": "I can't believe I missed this game back in 2000. It may have taken me 15yrs but I have finally played it. So, what did I think?  I freaking LOVE this game! It reminds me of Severance: Blade of Darkness/Enclave, which I enjoyed in my youth. Graphically it holds up all right and you can still make out what is what. The story is good and works to motivate you to continue, even if it is rather simple. The Norse setting and theme is good even if certain structures and characters don't always portray that. When facing other Vikings you get taunted with things like, 'I'm going to drink mead from your skull' and 'Look, a troll has wandered in from the cold', which adds to the immersion and causes me to smile. There is much plat-forming in this game, with ledge climbing/jumping and rope/chain climbing. Some can be tricky but enjoyable.  Combat is, well ok. Not brilliant but it gets the job done; satisfying when you hack/slice limbs and heads off. Enemy AI is quite shocking and sometimes they just stand still and let you kill them. This just makes me laugh, it was made in 2000 after all.  Overall a great plat-forming, hack 'n' slash action-adventure game. It has its flaws yet I cannot get enough of it. Make sure to grab the mod that adds back the missing levels that were cut from the Gold version. Makes sense to play the full game.  8/10",

            "review_text": "Rune Classic is tpp action game based on Norse mythology, released in 2000 and powered by first Unreal Engine.  The story is showing the conflict between the gods Odin and Loki and the preparations to Ragnarok, the end of the world. Depending on player actions at the end of the game it offers two possible endings.   Graphical it's dated game but some locations still have nice design. Audio is done ok with average voice acting and some good backround music that is played in key moments of the game.   Combat is probably the best part of the game with quite demanding skirmishes, often with multiple enemies. Even on normal mode you can easily and literally lost your head.  Ragnar the main hero of the game can use four types of weapons: swords,axes,hammers and maces.He can also use shields and rune power that each weapon has. But if you are bored of fighting with normal gear you can always grab a limb or head that your dead opponent have lost in the duel and use it against other enemies!  There's also multiplayer mode where you can prove your skills in the combat against other players. It's challenging but at the same time quite fun to play.  If you are a fan of tpp action games and like Norse mythogy then it's in my opinion a must have in your Steam library. ",

The quicksave system is a little weird, so I got frustrated for today :P (Probably because of no Admin access is my guess)  This is the first game I ever played on the first day of its release and I haven't played this in 15 years, so nostalgia definitely hits hard!  Pros: Lots of freaking weapons! (Swords, Maces, Axes) Fun and addicting combat Runes that adds extra stuff to your weapons. Foods and interactable plants etc. Mead of course! Simple platforming mechanics. (Climbing is a neat feature here!) Multiplayer that still works (Not a lot of players though! damn.)  Cons: Some platforming areas and puzzles can be really frustrating and just not fun. Crashes still occurs, but you can avoid those by not minimizing the game at all.   Fantastic game! ;) ",

            "review_text": "Rune Classic includes the original Rune and the Halls of Valhalla expansion. Gameplay is very similar to the original; however, there are a few noticeable changes.  - In the single player campaign, many of the levels have been shortened and some have been removed completely. This does help keep the game moving along (especially in the first cavern areas); though, fans of the original game will likely notice a few memorable areas missing.  - A few new enemies have been added: skeletons, hellhounds, and frost giants.  - Some of the weapon rune powers have been swapped. For example, the viking short sword now has the vampire rune power, and the viking broad sword now has the befriend rune power.  Overall, I still like the game. The only complaint I have is that a couple bugs have not yet been fixed (as of version 1.10).  - In the cave area just after Ragnar gets off the large beetle, there is a cliff area that will kill Ragnar if any items (weapons, shields, body parts, etc.) fall into it.  - Near the end of the game, there is a cinema scene where the sarks are breaking through a wall with hammers. This scene causes the game to crash unless you turn the volume down to zero in the game control panel.",

All in a fluid motion that seems natural even with mouse and keyboard, like that is how a mouse and keyboard would do it if they had free will. In the corner of your eye (screen) you see movement, and a someone throws a weapon at you, it spins through the air directly at you. With a casual flip of the mouse and a click just so, you bat the intrusion away, possibly into yet another someone. All this is possible, and even common, in a ffa arena in Rune. I don't own enough thumbs to give this game the respect it deserves.  ~Mr_Fister.",

Sweet baby Jesus though, they don't make games like this any more and by that I mean this game is seriously HARD.  Played through on hard mode and even after playing through other classic PC games (Quake, Doom etc) on their hardest settings, this is just something else. The enemies at the latter stage of the game kill you in more or less 2 hits, have gigantic weapons and are faster than Bruce Lee and the final boss is just tear-bait. Not going to lie, I could only complete it after lowering the game speed (avaliable in the game settings, no cheats) and even then, 1 tiny slip and you're taking a dirt bath.  Protip: save often, save after cutscenes (some of them are quite long, you can't skip them and when you die you'll have to watch them again unless you reload) and if you bug out on the Trickster's Chamber battle (i.e. the metal bars are not opening before the Loki chamber) the only solution I could find is to restart the level (can be done through the load menu).",

            "review_text": "I just finished the single player mode after a little bit over 10 hours of gameplay and what can I say?  This is the remake of a very solid hack and slay games from the early 2000s, the graphics haven't improved much (or at least that's why my spoiled eyes see nowadays) but it doesn't lessen the fun, while hacking and jumping through hordes of monsters.   Admittedly there's not that much variety amongst the monsters and the scenes, there a few major themes, but well ... in the end they all boil down to a rather straightforward and linear design (pull a lever here, press a plate there, kill some more monsters etc.). It was still fun. Nearing the end I was wondering if it'd be better if some of the scenes would have been shorter ...  But I guess we owe this to the age of the original game, back then I had much more time to spent, today I like to be able to finish a game while it is still hot ;-)  Speaking of hot, the game provides you with a little story, which is told in various ingame cutscenes (skippable with the ctrl key). It's nothing to fancy, but it was enough keep me entertained till the end non the less, mainly with its interesting background (I used steam overlay to lookup references to the nordic mythology from time to time, very interesting and it made me appreciate the game even more). Another thing I have to mention, is that this remake is well done from a technical standpoint, I played this with a resolution of 1920x1080 on my Windows 7 64bit machine and I haven't had a single crash or glitch*, the controls are very smooth and intuitive.  All in all I can recommend getting this game if: a) you like hacking stuff b) you like vikings c) you played 3d computer games in the 90s and early 2000 and don't care to much how the game looks (it's an unreal engine game)  When it was on sale you were able to get it for 2,50€ which is absolutely fair for the 10 hours of sp fun it provides (not counting the multiplayer - if you like multiplayer games like Half-Life Deathmatch, with vikings)  * (well, actually there is a problem in one of the last levels, where a triggered cutscene causes the game to freeze, if you disable sound for that mission then you're fine. If you've reached this point however, you're so determined to finish that game, that this minor hickup probably wont bother you anymore ;-) )",

            "review_text": "I'll review only the single player adventure.  TL;DR - the game is not terrible, but it is not worth 10$ (i got it for like 50 cents in some RPG bundle) and the 12-14 hours of gameplay is very repetetive. No wonder that less then 9% of buyers even finished it.  The game bases on some version of Odin-Loki-Ragnarok mythos however it does very bad job using the viking (or Northsmen) culture. You will spend on a ship about 2 minutes. No brutal raids on innocent foreigners, no social life at all and drinking mead is just a sad, lonely first aid kit. Its just a walking simulator with poorly designed battles.  The game mostly fits to the same category as Half Life (publshed 3 years earlier) - you keep walkin, jumping and fighting. Puzzles/jumping -&gt; a couple of fights -&gt; puzzles/jumping -&gt; fighting and so on and so on. Unlike Half Life though the plot is very simplistic and not engaging; the third person perspective destroys the illusion of every-man protagonist (who also never speeks and has no personality at all); most of the weapons are very similiar and you can basically just hold to the latest-strongest weapon available; most of the enemies blindly charge at you (or stand in one place - the game is insanely buggy); and the landscapes are mostly grey, boring dungeons and mountain tunnels.  It wasn't a waste of time but I deffinitely do not recomment this game even though it has some great reviews on Steam (I assume nostalgia-based).",

Funnily enough, it's still just as fun and captivating as the first time I played it years ago. This is one of the best Viking games there is.   It has action combat and platforming puzzles. Sometimes it can be quite difficult, as health pick ups are limited and scattered. Exploration is rewarded sometimes with rare runes that increase your health or rune power permenantly. Othertimes you might find much needed simple health and rune pickups and weapons you don't have yet.  The story by now is a bit cliche but it holds true to Norse mythology rather well. I wish more games were developed like this one.",

Developers didn't really care about how much money they get from their games, it was just a secondary objective. They cared about their customers. They wanted their game to be as much bada** as possible. And at that time there weren't many expectations. What might look basic in this year, wasn't so basic at all back then. And these games sometimes have things that new games don't. It's really worth to try these old games! For this game: It's about a Viking hero, who needs to fight through Hel's domain and the dark dwarves' world to stop the end of the world coming faster than it should. The game's mechanics are great for its time and it would still hold its place. It's your standard slashing game with three types of weapons: Sword, Axe and Blunt weapons. And shields of course. Every weapon has its special powers, that you can use, if you have rune power, that you can earn by collecting runes, also you can raise your health with health runes, etc, etc....... So it's a pretty entertainig game! And it has multiplayer mode to offer, and servers a really easy to host, you don't even need a router! I absolutely recommend this game to everyone, and if you are into Viking things, then it's a game you shouldn't miss!",
