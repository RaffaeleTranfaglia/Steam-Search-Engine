            "review_text": "Improves on 15 in almost every way.  Great graphics, lighting is much improved as is the design of the world, the new map looks brilliant and is much bigger than previous games.  Tractors feel weighty and actually sound like they should (even down to the crunching of the mud underneath them).  Worker AI seems to be much better and you now receive a notification if a tractor gets stuck which is very useful. The option of cruise mode is a welcome addition also.  Multiplayer works great but unfortunately I couldn't get missions to work, I've now gathered that this is intentional, its a real shame as it makes the multiplayer much harder to earn decent money but I'm sure it'll be adressed eventually.  Worth the Â£30 at the moment, much better than 15 and will surely swallow hundreds of hours of my time.",

            "review_text": "Easily one of the best simulators on the market today.   Much improved over FS15, you will be a very busy farmer/rancher tending to fields, animals, logging, and many other tasks at hand. The idea of having to mix certain ration ratios for your animals to improve production of slurry and manure to spread on your fields to get more yield is pretty nice. Breeding animals and selling them to the market and being able to be self contained with your animals not depending on buying food etc. With FS17 you are growing your own food and creating your own bi-product for better yields and to feed your animals and of course saving money.   A few little setbacks with the helpers not plowing fields correctly or in one case I had a helper finish one field to automatically move to the next field 'bug or glitch not suppost to do that' to find he was windrowing the wrong way destroying the layout..lol I have worked farms before in RL and there are people out there that do that sort of stuff so I call it a matter of finding good help. lol  There are so many things I could list but can easily recommend this game to any sim fans. You can pretty much customize the layout of your farm now with more placeables etc, upgrading silos, adding vehicle shelters, water towers etc. You don't have to pay for water if you can find decent spots along the river to dip your water tanker in to refill. Lots of free mods by Giants Software you can add like dynamic tires, realistic tire physics, damaging crops by driving over them, and lots of free equipment!  The game really seems to be a strategy/logistics type of game to maximize profit. There are ways you can manipulate the market but I'll let you figure that out. If you love simulators or farming/ranching then you really can't go wrong with FS17.",

            "review_text": "Incredible improvement from FS15. I too was doubtful and worried about the fact that FS17 was using the same old engine, but oh boy was I wrong. Almost everything has been upgraded - lighting, model quality, game mechanics - and it somehow manages to run smoother than FS15 ever did for me, with a minimal amount of fidgeting with graphics settings. There are a few minor issues I have - the game has released with about 15 high quality mods 'built in' to the game (as in there is a menu where you can install them easily for free) but some of these I would rather have seen be in the game from the get go, without any separate installation required. Another thing which has been improved since 15 but is still a problem for me is controls sensitivity. There are finally sliders for this, and they do change the sensitivity but let's say I wanted it my steering sensitivity for my game controller down to 50%, it reduces the sensitivity but it also halves the turning radius of the tires, which is extremely annoying and makes no sense to me. Likewise, if you were to modify to sensitivity for the gas (which is right trigger by default) down to 50%, it halves your top speed. I wish it wasn't so difficult, but it's honestly something I can forget just due to how beautiful this game is. The tractors no longer look like plastic, the lighting isn't free SDK quality anymore.... Completely satisfied with my purchase and can't wait for more hours with this game. Would definitely recommend to anyone who has enjoyed a Farming Simulator game in the past, and anyone who can appreciate the concept of waiting for grass to grow in a video game.",

            "review_text": "I highly recommend this game, its obviously not for those who expect a lot to happen in a short space of time, its very repetitive but isn't that the point? Anyway, here are the good and bad points.  GOOD: Very high attention to detail: The models in this game are very realistic, slightly better than the previous game but still better.  Mod Manager: Although there aren't many mods available on the Mod Manager, there are still enough to make the game noticeably different. I also love how most of the mods are actually by GIANTS and are FREE which is very respectable because if it was any other developer they would have released them as paid DLC.  Radio: There are 4 radio stations, Rock, Pop, Electro and Country even though the songlist isn't that big its still a decent improvement and hopefully in the future the ability to add your own songs or a radio mod.  New Crops and Vehicles: Its awesome to see new crops in Farming Simulator it obviously adds a lot more realism and at the same time, more work to do.  New Maps: Goldcrest Valley and Soznovka. At the moment I have only played on Goldcrest which is a very well laid out map, so I assume Soznovka will be laid out very well too, I just don't like it because it looks very rustic and I prefer modern.  Vehicle modifications: This is my favourite addition by far, the ability to modify your vehicles adds a bit more flexibility to the vehicles you buy, althought not every vehicle can be modified there are still a lot that can.  BAD: Animal Animations: They aren't really that bad, but they could be a little bit smoother. When the animals walk they sort of judder and the transition from animations are instant but either way they are still not too bad.  No Crop damage: This can be rectified by downloading a mod using the in-game mod manager, but it would be nice to see that little bit of realism added by default, it could even be toggleable.  Maps: There are only 2 maps, although they are very VERY nice maps, itt would be nice to see more maps by the masters at Giants rather than fan-made. I don't know about you, but the game feels more official when you play on a map made by the devs rather than fans.    Well, thats about it, I know I have only played 42.1 hours as of posting this review but thats still a pretty long time in my opinion considering I do play other games too. So again, I highly recommend this game, especially if you have more than one monitor, its really fun to just play this and watch Netflix on another screen, a great way to chill out :D",

            "review_text": "Spot on. On the surface it does not look like much of a improvement to fs 15 but it clearly is. The game is much better balanced and forces you to work hard to keep thing going, You get worn out equipment at the start that has large running costs, the game makes you understand this fast. It I think is a great way to balance the start. I like that now you have to work for a living and you cannot let your farm hands do the work. 1 day in fs 17 is a whole lot longer than in 15. The graphics are a great deal better but view distance is not very good (maybe I need to change the settings)  At the end of the farming day Its MANY little thing that make fs 17 great and a vast improvement. 10/10",

            "review_text": "First off, the map. Tipical Giants size map. It seems they will never make a bigger map. The Town design is much improved over FS17. The lighting at night is great. But the fields are tipical Giants size &amp; shape. The new foilage textures are good as well. As expected the animal are all scattered over the map (and now that pigs are included in this version) a lot of anoying running back ad forth to each local. 6 Versions of the game, and Giants still don't get it. Now comparing CrestView fields &amp; Sosnovka Fields, Sosnovka is better. With CrestView There's pretty much nothing you can do. With Sosnovka come of the fields can be joined.   As for the animals, the additions are much needed, But good god, $5000. for one cow. $3000 for one pig. Duh, And it seems like in each verion of the game this maintenance cost seems to double. Up to $2000 a day main. cost for a decent combine. need i say more.  As for the vehicles, the textures and animation are amazing. The custimization is great but....why go to all of this trouble if all of the custimization is the same, for all of the vehicles. The Wide , skinny, dual tripple tire &amp; Wheels. The SAME!. On ALL THE TRACTORS! I'm sure Giants had to go through a lot to get the liscense for each major brand, Then stick identical tires &amp; wheels on everything. And to make it worse they changed the engine sounds as well. Now you only hear the acelleration sounds. When the rpm levels out you hear nothing. WRONG! And they did it one every vehicle. And to add injury to insult, they brought back that annoying compressor clicking sound that was in the 2013 game. It's a sound loop that replays every 15 seconds. In EVERY VEHICLE!. It wasn't in the 2015 game. And speaking of 2013, they returned with that help icon that stops you in you tracks, forcing you to click on it. Why they put these irritating thing back in 2017 is beyond me.The one thing i think Giants got perfect was the new menu system with helper info. It informes you when your helper is finished a field, something blocking it's or stuck on something(awsome) I mean the game is still good and highly reccomended, is just with all new versions some of the contents will be questionable and a lot of the kinks fixed with time.

Almost everything has been improved, like the gfx are smoother and better, optimization is a lot better, physics aren't so clumsy and jumpy anymore, acceleration on the machines are far better.  Some things still leave room for improvement, like the menu system, which is the same confusing one we know from FS15.  FS17 will simulate descent physics for the things you really need, like driving over rough terrain etc., but things like colliding with AI vehicles has been left out as well as you wont be able to run over bushes without them just passing thru your vehicle.  It seems like theyve managed to separate the important things from the less important with focus on what the games about and as it is about farming, then smashing into other vehicles have had no priority.  If you liked the earlier FS games, this one wont disappoint.",

I'm enjoying building my farm up to support pigs which I think will turn into a great profit driver. I enjoy running the game at real speed and using the extra time to run missions for other farmers which not only helps my bottom line but drives the price down for their fields when I someday buy them!

            "review_text": "First of all I would like to say that I was maliciously forced into writing this review by Steam, in order to get the Autumn Sale Steam Badge 2016 (just making my parents proud). So if you've got any complaints, blame Valve!  Well FS 17 is obviously about farming if you haven't sussed it out so far! Modern farming. Modern farming with modern farming machines getting bigger and bigger as you progress. Yee-Haw!  But it's not simply about driving up and down your fields in a tractor. It's a solid management game (mainly money): Should I buy a bigger plough (or plow if you like), sower or harvester? The plough might simply catch up with the harvester, making it unnecessary. Or should it be a 2nd harvester or another field? Should I take up a bigger loan in order to get both? Or should I simply pay off my loan first? Etc... As time progresses you'll have more and more to take care of. It won't only be the work on the fields, checking the market for prices and handling you're braindead workers, but you might also be taking care of your animals (chicken, pigs, sheep and cows), driving X from A to B, doing the odd forestry, picking up hay bales you previously ran over, making plans on where to place your next investment, or simply sitting in a tractor with a worker inside and watch him do his work âBecause I can afford it nowâ. Once you get the hand of the game, it quite self-explanatory.  It's slow paced, grindy, zen-like gameplay. So don't expect to be owning the best equipment within the first few hours of the game. Great often afk / halfway playing game: While playing you can easily listen to music (in-game radio is available), watch any series or sports, ignore your sister on Skype because you're trying to drive perfect lines, or simply think about stuff like the history of dog food. I have most of my hours in MP: It's just so relaxing to drive up and down the fields with your co-farmers, honk every time you cross one another and pick up the odd machine fight because that same careless idiot touched you once again. Easy time management in SP or with admin rights on a dedicated server (real time - 120x). Servers are fairly cheap compared to other games. There are two available maps at the moment. An American (according to the many stars and stripes) and a Russian (I only assume it's Russian, you know, Cyrillic stuff). You've got a fair amount of official mods to choose from within the good in-game mod menu. Sadly they do not update automatically. It also would be handy if one could automatically download any needed mod once logging on to a new server.   Something I really miss is seasons. Snow, hail and rain do exist, but there are no real seasons with different crops to grow or any other preparations to take care of.  Obviously I can't recommend this game to everybody. The first time I came across this franchise I shook my head in disbelief asking myself âWhat kind of freaks play this game?â Little did I know I would become such a freak. But that's it: you have to be the player who likes relaxing games with slow progress. Who knows? There might just be that little farmer hiding somewhere within you (you'll find it out soon enough, otherwise Steam refund policy).  You might just end up having a blast of a time in the economic branch which is the backbone of our civilization. The surplus of food over thousands of years combined with the many inventions leading to the very fact that you are now sitting on your lazy â¥â¥â¥â¥, staring at your screen and just wasted a few minutes of your precious life reading my lousy review about a farming simulator instead of roaming the fields and woods in search for edible roots and berries.

There are some small inconsistancies here and there, but it's virtually bug free at release...which is impressive! My favorite moment/activity so far has been cutting down trees and loading them (uncut) into a trailer with a Telehandler. Depending on how large the tree is, it can be a real challenge to get it loaded while resisting the urge to trim it (you get more $ for longer/straigher wood &lt;gigidy&gt;). I was bouncing my lift like a hoopdy with hydrolics and lterally laughing my butt off!!  Be careful with that starter pickup tho, lol it gets a little squirrely @ high speeds in the dirt.

There are no chopper headers that can pick up straw. The grass/hay header is supposed to be able to, but it can't. Very frustrating. Also, when you reset a trailer full of grain, you loose the whole trailer of grain (it resets empty). That was a spendy lesson learned the hard way. Also, the price of silage is about $600 a ton instead of $3200. Not cool. Working for other farmers is an interesting twist, but it can take over 2 hours (real time) just to harvest a field (which has to be done manually. You are the hired help so you can't hire someone else to do it.) But it is better than driving all over the map with pallets. That never really made much sense to me in FS15. I like the fact that you can fertilize the fields three times during the sowing and growing process to increase your yeild. I also like the trains, they're cool. You get two maps with FS17, but one is the Sosnovka map from FS15 updated to the new game play in FS17. Would have preferred to have two completely new maps. Especially for the price. I have $2 mil in the bank and own 7 fields so far. I'll keep playing because I'm hooked since FS15, which I khave over 1600 hours of game time on. Overall I would recommend FS17, but if you have never played FS15 you should definately buy that game first.",

            "review_text": "Pros:  - If you just want to get on and farm a bit it can be fun.  - It's fun to mess around with different farm equipment.  - You can fell a tree and watch it land on a car and receive no penalty. Then you can walk on said tree while it is resting on the car and cut off the limbs. After this you can cut it to smaller pieces and drag them over the hood of a car, again without any penalty. You can do this as many times as you want on another person's property and completely deforest land you don't own...without penalty.  Cons: - Physics are horrible. If you cut a tree down there is a chance it could drop right through the earth. Things will start to bounce around at random and act rubbery.  - Collisions are messed up. If you are plowing a flat field you will probably be fine but the moment you start to navigate precarious equipment in tight circumstances things will start to either pass completely through other items and scenery or they will get stuck in it entirely. Light poles and railroad fences are notorious for grabbing onto my farm and forestry equipment.  - The 'simulation' factor is pretty low. If you are a fan of heavy equipment and get a kick out of that aspect you will find that you can't press any buttons or interact with the equipment other than by using a few keymaps or by sliding the mouse around. If you are a fan of farm management you will be disappointed to know that instead of hiring and managing staff you just press H to hire a person to do the job you are currently doing and it 'auto-drives' your tractor. Books management boils down to paying off a debt the game automatically just hands you (or collecting more debt), and you can't even have equipment or seed delivered to your farm. The store you buy pallets of seed from doesn't even have a forklift to load your seed pallets.  - The UI is terrible. Nearly everything in the game is icon based yet you can't mouse over anything to see what it is. You are just expected to know the symbol for a certain type of plant or seed.  - Menu system is not very good. Why should I have to save the game then exit to the main menu just to see the entire keymap? That should be visible in the game.  - AI vehicles and 'NPC's.'  - Annoying pop-ups in the game that will stop you from driving until you click them away.  - Walking near a tree with a chainswa will give you a 'cut ring' maybe 1 in 10 times making it frustrating to cut down trees. (then you watching about half of them slide straight into the earth and disappear).  - Originally I had the train as a pro because I thought it was cool. That was before I tried using it to haul logs. Even if you cut the logs to length and stack them evenly so they shouldn't move they will end up bouncing all over the place like rubber. I lost every single log going 30-40kph, watching them all shoot into the air like rockets! I've never seen anything like it...  - I have encountered a bug in literally every tutorial I have done...all of them related to poor physics. After having a tree fall through the earth on the forestry tutorial I decided to abandon forestry until they patch it. I decided that maybe animals would be a good way to go. After dumping the feed into the trough my tractor did a front flip into the air and landed in the pig pin...",

I have played 20 hours so far and barely have any money. Equipment costs and hired help cost eat up anything you make. I tried the leasing way and started making a little more money but not enough to make the game move at a speed that makes you feel like you are progessing. If you cant progress at a good rate the game gets old running the same equipmnet over the same fields. The only way is to go and manually farm other people's fields.   Too slow of progression is killing the game for me.",

Oh let me explain, early morning mists hanging over the fields, a threat of rain on a succesfull harvest. Waking up to find a crop flattened. Trees that move when its windy. Weeds, bushes, insects. The edges to the water ways are just as jagged, the paths and fields are just as flat. Its like being in a 3D editor! I was impressed with the equipment models and sounds, yet this is not a farm, its must be were Bill and Ben the flowerpot men live.  I have just come out of Battlefield 1 though! So might explain my frustration in finding nothings changed. Yet will go back to playing FS13 as I loved the rough more natural challenges of the field shapes and the rough more natural old farm buildings, that always made the new equipment look so good.

Now Farming Simulator 17 has hit the shelves, and I'm completely blown away. Everything I've ever wanted since playing the orignal Farm Sim 11, and things I've suggested and talked with others about has come to pass. I know this won't be the end for the Farming Simulator seires, but I've got to say. GIANTS nailed it. This, IS, what we've been wanting and looking for. I won't ruin the learning experience for you if you're starting out, but let's just say, If you want a taste of the life of a farmer, you'll find it here. 10/10 Would most definetely recomend, worth EVERY bit of it's cost.",

For Â£29.99, this is a great return, and I will almost definitely enjoy hundreds of hours playing this game.  Now, If you excuse me, I have a field to plow :P",

WIth even more simulation in details. But we can forgive this 'sin' for FS17. Somedays earlier a thought visited me - here`s your fresh new piece of farming Call of Duty. But that stayed until I tried it myself. Because graphics appearance almost not changed, in general speaking it still looks VERY similar to FS15. So a, that`s why 'farming Call of duty' har har har... Anyway, thanks to the mods and thanks to the developer, who managed optimise all that bunch into one game, we have FS17. And I think, mods are the most important thing that drives this game series forward... Every new mod adds small piece of replayability, a new blood to the game. And what I value most - player is given an options, how he wanna play this, a customisation of game settings, a level of 'realism' what you like. And with this game in series it feels more customisable than previous ones. I welcome that. More ways to play - more different people may like it. So a... that`s it. Thanks for reading.",

            "review_text": "I am making another review about this game and hopefully its a little bit more information than what I originally had. so here it goes.   First off I did play FS15 but I was never able to get mods on it it was probably user error on my part but it couldn't be helped, now on FS17 I can just download the mods right off the bat without having to go into the workshop and download them from there.   The Graphics on this game is 10 times better than what FS15(no mods) looks like the ground looks real and when your plowing or cultivating it is outstanding to see and hear what your machine is actually doing. Now with the mod for FS17 to add the effects of when it rains and your tires sink into the ground thats really cool to watch.   Its also the small things in the game that really makes this a great game specially when i'm in my Harvester and I'm harvesting my hard grown crops I noticed that my Harvester is actually bouncing to give it a feel that your actually in the vehicle when I go into 1st person view kinda makes me feel car sick sometimes lol. I also like the ability to lease out a tool or vehicle when you don't really have the money to actually buy one right off the bat. Depending on what you get you could save your self a lot of money. I also like the fact you will have to upgrade your vehicles at some point because they have been used to much and the cost of maintaining them is getting to high almost like a real tracker. Its even harder when you actually try Hard difficulty and almost all your money is going into your crappy old beginner vehicles and not able to pay your loan off.  Now I haven't actually figured out which is the best crop to grow (and if anyone does please message me about it) but I don't mind learning all this even if I make a major mistake like trying to grow one crop and then growing different without realizing it again another user error. But to feel like your actually there working the field and cutting down the trees to make more room for your self makes this game an outstanding game I would recommend this game to everyone who did play FS15 and if you are new or curious about this try it and always remember have patience sometimes it may take forever to figure it out but in the end its rewarding when you see your self cutting down your crops and making a major profit so again try it and just have the patience.",

Not including all the new equipment, if you were worried that your favorite DLC from FS15 wasnt included, it is.

However what they have done is completely overhauled everything else, the graphics are outstanding the detail is immense, the sounds are rich and submersive and the new layout to the menus and options are greatly recieved. Being able to tweak a variety of different settings to make your own experience the way you want it to be.   The addition to the mods menu and link strainght to the website to seemlessly download mods direct into game is just what was needed, although support for the steam workshop would of been a nice addition to.  The increased crops and animals as well as vehicles and equipment makes a nice change to the norm that we're all used to from previous FS games however they did leave some of the old favourites. The addition of being able to lease vehicles within the store menu as well as customizing is excellent, but it would of been nice to be able to see a preview of the additions made during customization.  All in all this is a good game and like any game has it good points and bad points, in this case the good outnumber the bad, and with Giants always updating and improving thigs you won't be dissapointed with this addition to the Farm Sim franchise.",

All the good staff??,well,u can chek it on youtube,cause there is alot to write.

The multiplayer is stable and does not crash, lagg or any desync problem. I nominated this for the 'Buggiest. Experience.' Totally different things btw.  Buggiest, because everything you do literally make the game bug- Trying to cut down a tree, tree down. Now I just need to chop this to smaller pieces and it starts to float into the ground. AND It's gone.  Experience because it's fun experiencing and farming with your friend. *Ahem* Destroying your friends life in multiplayer. It's a real experience.  10/10 Will never farm in real life",

You no longer exist in a void. Other farmers work the fields around you, so you can work for them to get extra money to buy stuff. Stuff like their fields, right out from under them, crops included. Some of my beloved vehicles are missing, but they've been replaced with others. Rebalancing giveth, and it taketh away. Still missing precise adjustments, such as deadzones and specifying which things I want the Y axis inverted for. As I type this, I'm guiding a harvester that keeps wandering off leftwards due to a need for a deadzone; this controller is touchy and I can't find the spare.  You can drive trains, too! and use the train horn, which provides minutes of amusement just by itself. Oh, and you can be a girl. This has no actual effect other than a different model.  The farming itself is much more in-depth, with extra steps added to micromanage. And you can lease stuff, if you want to pay less upfront but more over time. Much prettier than 2015 graphically, too.",
