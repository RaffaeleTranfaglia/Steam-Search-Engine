            "review_text": "Largely inspired by the abstract paintings of M.C. Escher, The Bridge is an equally abstract puzzle games which merges gorgeous artwork with an almost Marble Madness-esque tilt mechanic to create an original, evocative experience. It asks you to set aside traditional logic, and adopt a new mindset in a world created on and by its own unique rules, which prove harder to adopt to than you might think.  The constant flux of gravity is at the center of every puzzle, requiring you to rotate the entire level in order to make your way to the exit. New mechanics such as items which exist in opposition of your own gravity, ones which can only be used by inverting yourself, and other various means to hinder your progress, are introduced as you progress but the basic foundation that up and down are perhaps one and the same holds the game together as things become more and more esoteric in design. It's a very thoughtful game, even in terms of the controls that although sluggish at first, become an integral part of the contemplative pacing once you've adjusted to the relatively slow speed at which everything moves.  Underneath the puzzles is a story largely open to interpretation. There are hints at what the protagonist, a nameless but brilliant mathematician was attempting, but right up to the end pieces are purposely left out so as to let your come to your own conclusions. While this works fantastically for the narrative, when it begins to bleed into the gameplay the experience becomes slightly too obtuse and the end goal less and less focused. This is most apparent in the later stages where the difficulty is highest, but the rules as to how everything works still obnoxiously unclear. Even having completed them, I couldn't explain to you how many of the mechanics work, which I feel for the style of game is a rather big problem. Solving a puzzle should be something I can figure out on my own, not a random series of events that somehow allows me to arrive at the same conclusion, and yet this is exactly what happened much of the time.  Despite the occasional frustration I had with the level designs, my predominant experience was one of continual wonder and curiosity as I made my way through the gorgeously drawn environments, accompanied by unexpectedly grand sound design and a reposed score that creates the feeling that something is amiss without the need for lengthy cutscneses or drawn out dialog.  It's an exceptionally artistic journey, but a short one. I completed the game in just under two and a half hours, and while this does unlock mirrored versions of every level (a minor switch that adds an unexpectedly hefty challenge), I personally didn't feel compelled to complete them. Regardless, if you were intrigued by the art design I wouldn't hesitate to pick this up. While it definitely seemed to lack...something....the end result is still a rewarding and highly intriguing game that kept me engaged and left many puzzles wonderfully open to ponder after I put it down. Though one can only wonder what he would think of such an unusual offspring of his artwork, I feel if Escher was alive today he'd be as impressed as I am with Ty Taylor and Mario Castañeda's strange creation, which might ironically get him some new fans of his own.

            "review_text": "The Bridge is a neat journey that offers a vigorous challenge and some (slightly) new concepts to those well versed in puzzle games.  Gameplay revolves around manipulating gravity around your character, who can't run or jump, and various objects in order to reach a door. As the games goes on more mechanics are added: locks, fast moving boulders, and so on. After the first play though you could always challenge yourself in the mirrored world (which is more than just inversions) or try to find all the wisps.  The art and animation are praiseworthy. Impossible architecture fills out the hand-drawn world. The M.C. Esher style is well done and makes this game stand out. Though I enjoyed the art, at times I felt like Air Force academies could use this game to train pilots.  In many ways this game is companion to Braid. Where Braid revolved around the concept of freedom in gameplay (running around and messing with time), while The Bridge seems to deal with restraint (physically limited and trapped in gravity). Braid's vivid water-colors also act as a counterpoint to The Bridge's hand drawn black and white style. Though I am simplifying, these differences (and many more) are interesting to note and for that I think the Bride deserves more attentino.  There is a lot of depth to this game (upon close inspection) and it is brimming with challenge. Puzzle fiends should have a great time with The Bridge, casual puzzle fans will find a nice challenge.",

You rotate the map, or move your character, or rewind from where you failed. Simple controls, but doesn't make it easy for you to work through the game at all. Lots of out-of-the-box thinking is required, some levels had me scratching my head for hours.  I thought I finished the game (4 chapters) in under 2 hours, but there's a mirrored version of the entire game after completing it, incorperating elements from the chapter 4 brain-teasers and making them nearly impossible.

Despite its simple controls, the movement can be very complex at times, requiring quick directional changes for both rotation and movement in some levels. However, any mistakes can be easily fixed by the convient, but sometimes tidious, rewind function.   The greatest downside I encountered was that it is very disorienting; personally, it made me dizzy. I've done my fair share of roller coasters and fair rides without problem so I considered myself intolerant to such matters, but It may have been becuase I was dehydrated, hungry, tired, or any other external causation that makes you sensitive to disorientation, but I quickly decided that whatever the reason, it wasn't worth the trouble. However, for those who know they are less susceptible to dizziness, if you think the game looks pretty and you like complex puzzles, try it out; you might like it.",

You come across new mechanics throughout the levels.  It's possible to rewind time and undo every action you've made, going back how far you wish and attempt any part without having to redo the whole level. It's slow paced and you can really take your time on the levels.  The game is quite short which can be finished within a day and there's not much replay value. There's no real story to follow but you can find various bits of text scattered around the world to read.  Simple art design but really well drawn and in grey scale to give each level a nice eerie atmosphere. I got this in a humble bundle and it's not something I would personally buy but I have no complaints about the content in the game. It's well made and well thought out.

Then the gameplay itself seems very simple, at least for the first two worlds and a half: Everything is played only on one mechanic, that is to tilt the screen to use gravity at your advantage.

The physics/logic puzzles seem more trial and error oriented than either pure logic or brilliant lateral 'ah-ha' thinking (ntohing yet resembling the epiphanies of Antichamber, Braid or Stanley Parable yet).   The art style is kind of neat (again, very DaVinci meets MC Escher-ish) but the soundtrack is more tedious than anything and has started to grate already.  I'll say no for the time, but I reserve the right to finish playing through and reverse judgment. Hoping this game has a few tricks in store that *literally* blow my mind :) I'm guessing this is a one-man team and it feels like a decent effort, but I'm very much at arm's length from it.",

Winterbottom.  In each of the above, the puzzles are soluble only with some kind of bright spark of an idea, with a relatively simple execution. In The Bridge, the puzzles often come down to trial and error, until eventually you arrive at a relatively complex execution. So, instead of a cathartic flash of inspiration at the end of a puzzle, instead you get a mild feeling of relief as the gauntlet is over.  Perhaps if The Bridge had a more engaging style, like the above puzzlers do, its more grinding puzzles would not hold it back so. As it stands, The Bridge shoots for atmospheric, which it achieves to a limited extent. However, the atmosphere is too thin and too monotonous to really persuade me to come back to it. In the end, very little motivates me to actually play the game.  If it's on sale, you might as well pick it up. Like I said, it's not an incompetent game.

But the moment everything falls into place you have that 'aaaaaaaaaaah that was really cool' moment and then go about your day, never to remember that moment or post ever again?  This is the game version of that senario.   This game is so short I beat it within the short timespan between waking up at 8 in the morning before leaving for class at 10. During that time the game held my attention irrevocably, making my mind and perception twist and warp until it was able to wrap around the rules of the particular level that I was on. But the moment all the pieces fell into place, the puzzle was solved immediately and I went about to the next level, ready to meld my mind around the next challenge.   Then I completely forgot I owned this game after that.  Conclusion: 4/10 Interesting puzzles, but very underwhelming once you were able to change your perspective. If you want to try for yourself, then I suggesst waiting for around for a 50-75% sale.",

First, each level consists of one puzzle to solve and there aren't that many levels.

And third, the game tries to double its length by making 'mirror' levels, which are the same levels as the first half of the game, but flipped and with a bit of added difficulty.

Sometimes it's simply because I spent the money and other times it is because of my OCD. There are games that I have just dropped completely, however, but this wasn't one of them.  The Bridge had a very interesting idea, but it was poorly executed. Braid was a MUCH better game that you should go purchase right now and not waste your money on this cheap 'sequel.'  For me, the puzzles just got too annoying too quickly and required too much painstaking effort to make sure the littlest piece didn't mess up. As OCD as I am, I usually enjoy immense effort in things like that, but this game just rubbed me the wrong way.  The gameplay was also very slow. Even if you know what to do in a level, it takes forever to get it done. The walking and turning is just terribly slow in something like 95% of the levels. Some people argue that it's because it is level-dependent, but there were only like 2 levels where I noticed the pacing was increased vastly. Other than that, all of them seemed the same slow drag to me.  Besides that, the color palette and lack of a story made it boring. Braid told a story and looked beautiful doing it. I usually don't hold games up side-by-side in a review, but this game tried to repeat Braid's success and failed. The game would have looked much better styled up like Braid (and it even shows that in two different 5 second scenes) and it really needed a story.  Overall, it seemed like a boring slog through annoying puzzles that led to no real payout of any kind.",

            "review_text": "Pros: + Puzzle mechanics (both in variety and number) + Art style + Sound effects and music + Cohesive design (bug/glitch-free, as far as my experience went)  Cons (all relatively minor): - Some puzzles can be a bit... finicky. - The 'story' is vague and doesn't really have a conclusion (as far as I can tell). - More puzzles should be possible, given the available mechanics.  The Bridge is a great game overall, and almost all of the details are well thought out. The mechanics and physics (which are obviously at the core of the game) are very well designed and I encountered no bugs or glitches to speak of. The art is terrific, very appropriate for the game/story, and wonderfully reminiscent of M.C. Escher. Putting everything together creates a marvelous puzzle experience.  Most of the complaints I have are relatively minor. In terms of game play, a few levels relied heavily on fenagling components into position or timing certain movements through trial-and-error. Generally, a certain amount of this is OK in a game, but a couple levels became frustrating. (Most were a lot of fun, though.) Also, given the variety of the mechanics, many more puzzles could have been included in this game. The developers likely capped the puzzle sets to what were released due to time and effort constraints. The sets they chose to include felt cohesive and had a pleasent progression in difficulty.  My only real gripe is with the 'story', such as it is. It seemed to have a ton of potential in the beginning, but nothing was ever truly explained/resolved or even hinted at in an obvious manner by the end. This is the one point that I feel the developers should have expounded since it seemed they had a really great story they wanted to tell. On a related note, some collectible wisps, which seem to explain part of the story, were incredibly difficult to find without help.  Once again, though, this is a very well-designed, solidly-developed, and entertaining game. I would definitely recommend it, especially to fans of the puzzle genre.",

In my opinion, it has a steep learning curve as the levels get more difficult pretty fast. Although, I don't usually play platformers or puzzles which might affect my opinion. What I found to be quite astonishing was the fact that you can actually rewind time to correct any mistakes. A few of the puzzles are extremely simple, so don't overthink them, while others require a lot of thought. There's also a giant rolling ball that is also manipulated by the same mechanics as your character is. If it touches you, you will die. The only problem I have with this game is that it's incredibly short, when counting it has only 4 chapters, with only 6 puzzles each. But, with this game's cryptic puzzling, it will keep you stumped out of ideas, as you overcomplicate things and try to get things in the right motion. The visual style of this game caught my eye.

            "review_text": "The Bridge will bend your brain. Not as much as say Antichamber, but it will force you to think ahead with how your manipulations affect the world around you.  You play as an unnamed intellectual (who bears a striking resemblance to surrealist M. C. Escher) who starts out napping under an apple tree. After discovering your ability to rotate the world, you get him awake and discover a number of puzzle doors have appeared in his house; why and how they are here is hinted at in text descriptions given by the protagonist but nothing is really explained. A sense of dread accompanies the game's progress. The first time you meet 'the menace' (balls with huge grinning faces that kill you with one touch), there is an uneasy feeling that something is wrong with these places beyond their defiance of reality.   The art is pretty in black and white; the story that is there serves as a vehicle to put you through the puzzles. There is a sense of achievement to be had with the later ones when momentum and quick thinking rotations come into play. One mechanic that could have been explained better is 'the Veil', which is a curtain that lets you manipulate the gravitational pull on certain objects. At first I thought it let me rotate objects independent of myself, but eventually deciphered its effects. I blundered through the veil puzzles a good bit before its potential hit me.  I got this for a dollar and found it easily worth that amount. Depending on your love of puzzle games, it is a good game to lose yourself in while trying to manipulate how to get the protagonist to his exit door. The downside is there is little to no replay. Some achievements help pad out the length as well as hidden collectibles, but basically the 48 puzzles behind the doors are it. The first half of the game is easy as it introduces concepts for you to play with, but then in the second half things get pretty tricky.   The Bridge would make Escher proud. Not a game you buy for the story but for the experience of solving its strange puzzles and experiencing its strange, ruined landscapes.",

The puzzles were engaging enough that I remained invested in playing through to the finish.  Cons: Puzzles range from really simple to extremely difficult.

There's also an 'overworld' that consists of your house, the yard around it, and multiple doors to the different, numbered worlds (and individual doors to each of the sub-levels in those worlds). So in those two regards (overworld layout and the simple 'undo your mistakes' button), it somewhat reminds me of Braid. The art style is interesting, complete with odd geometry and floating objects, but the lack of color for the main game gets a bit tiring. The puzzles have a good difficulty curve, and getting all the achievements requires some work (and/or guides).

I dont know $10 worth to pay but here is my review for The Bridge...   *The game has really good physics but the game is little bit dull... *You rarely use 'Walking' to finish the game, generally 'Rotating' is used to finish the game... It just spinning spinning spinning aaaand u got the key. *Sound could be better, and also music variety is poor *Dialogues.. hmmm.. No important dialogue I could remember. Therefore, if u looking for Story/Puzzle games (like The Cave or Vessel) Im not recommend it to you. *As a Graphics; my graphic card dont want to wake up for this game Im playing on integrated graphic card but its has very good Hand-Drawn BackGrounds, Structures, Menace (Wrecking-Ball), and a man *In Level Design, game has very complex puzzles maps, and making game Black&amp;White add more interesting atmosphere. *And Lastly I should metion that *There is Secrets....* We love secrets!!   Here is my review. I hope, I can be helpfull. Thank you for reading!  Extra: If this man can use his hands and hold on something while Im rotating the Gravity I would be very proud of him...",

            "review_text": "The Bridge reminds me a lot of Braid. It's not just the rewinding time -- it's also the slow and cerebral puzzle elements and the story based on theoretical thinking. However, due to the puzzles being more about you manipulating the environment over navigating the environment, it doesn't have the same hook as Braid and won't have the same wide appeal. (There's no platforming element or need for quick reflexes.)  The Bridge's early puzzles are too easy, but by the third room in your house they are challenging. I think it wasn't until the fourth room that I really enjoyed them because they pushed me beyond tinkering with the world to actually plan ahead to solve the puzzle.  After completing the main game, you can run through a 'mirror world' that tweaks all of the old puzzles to be much harder than before.  Good puzzle game that's based on thinking instead of doing.",

Being able to control gravity is very unique, and not something that you get to use in a lot of games, and I really like it. Plus, I love the M.C.

I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes puzzle platformers.",

The artwork is beautifully made and the controls are simple and easy to use. By using A/D to move and Left /Right Arrow Keys to tilt the world. With loads of other platformers competing on the market this one is my personal favourite. If you're going to get the game I would pick it up when it's on sale because it isn't really worth the price with about 5 hours gameplay.

Boggled being my mind's normal resting state, I soon encountered a puzzle (the 3rd, if memory serves) that I had to revisit many times before the mind-bogglingly simple solution presented itself. The following puzzle stumps me yet.  I would have appreciated a gentler difficulty slope on the road to bogglement, but it is what it is (a very clever and attractive game), I am what I am (a rather unclever and unattractive gamer), and I cannot really blame the game for the latter circumstance.  4 of 5 stars",

After strolling through a bunch of levels, each getting inceasingly more difficult or adding a new element to the gameplay, you get used to its mechanics and patterns. It's a creative way to learn to think outside the box while enjoying a unique and bizzare noire art style. The soundtrack is also splendid.   The Bad: The Bridge is short if you only want to breeze through the main levels and leave it at that. A few hours of gameplay, maybe more if you get really stuck, even more if the bonus mode you unlock intrigues you.   The TL,DR: Get it if you like puzzles and noire art, and want to kill a few hours.
