            "review_text": "This game is destroying my life. I just cant stop playing it. Think this game is all about combines and cultivators? I did. I thought 'why would i want to play a game about farming? that's stupid.' I cannot accurately explain how in depth this game actually is.   Harvesting crops is only 1/3 of this game. Hell, probably even less. You can literally play this game and never once harvest a crop and still make millions.   Forrestry is very lucrative, even on Hard difficulty.  Silage (fermented grass/chaff) making is extremely profitable, almost game-breakingly so.  If you do like the large combines (All hail the CR 10.90) and running large farmlands, there is plenty to do with grains/root vegetables, the latter of which will consume ALL your time.  Also, there are passive ways to make money as well. You can buy objects like solar panels to generate you small profits per hour, or eventually buy wind turbines to generate much larger profits. As well as semi-active income sources, like animals. Chickens take zero maintenance, just collect the eggs and sell them. Sheep require grass for food, to generate wool, and a forklift to transport the wool pallets to sell for a larger profit. Cows take a significant larger time/effort/money investment to run at high efficiencies, but can make you lots of money.  Last thing I'll say is that the mods for this game are absolutely wonderful. Anything the devs left out has been crafted by the modding communities. There's a mod for pretty much any application you need. Have a trailer that can't attach to your Quad-Trac tractor you just dropped 350K on? There's a simple mod for that!   I started typing this with the intent of making only one paragraph about it, but I am really a supporter of this game. It's extremely well done and for the pricetag, there's not much better.   I knocked it before i tried it because farming sounds soooo boring. I coulnd't be happier that I gave in and bought it. ",

            "review_text": "Hi to all you farmers.  Firstly this is a good game i have played it for over 100 hrs so i know it's good and bad points but over all it is a good game.  PROS... It has very clear and sharp focuse grathics and runs at 60fps You can add mods It does not slow your computer down when playing It has 4 DLC packs heaving with lots of equipment Reasonable price is an improvement on fs 2014 Has cattle to care for. You can harvest timber  Cons... Fails to give a feeling of real life such as it has no wildlife like birds in the sky flying or foxes and rabbits or deer and squrrils adding these things would be like on a real farm.  Needs to add pigs to care for. There is no 12 month cycle such as winter, sping, summer, autum as it would be nice to see snow in winter. Needs more DLC as not everyone likes to add mods in case of game conflicts Needs more maps and bigger maps too Need to feed chickens with seed Need to collect milk with tanker to sell to shops Need a egg station to store and box up your eggs then crate them and load them onto lorry to sell. Need to use more then 1 hired worker Need more trucks and Equipment. Need more steam achievements. Would be nice to have a wine vinyard and produce wine. Be able to plant grapes for your vinyard red and green grape fields Need strawberry field and produce strawberrys also apple trees to produce cider Need to plant mustard crops There is so much more i could suggest but it would end up being a book  Bugs... Traffice and hired worker has no AI as many times vehicles will collide with each other Grass verge is to narrow next to roads which causes collisons with traffic when vehicle is turning. Collisons with barn on plot 16 when using the HORSCH Pronto 9 SW sowing machine reason for this is the sowing machine is very long and not enough space to turn...to get around this bug just plant one strip of grass to make distance between barn and edge of field wider so vehicle will turn when using hired worker.  The Zunhammer SKE 18.5 PU Slurry Tank runs out to quickly and need to refill many times to do one crop.  Over all this is still a good game which will give you hours of fun but needs a patch to correct some of these issues.  Many people report having issues with this game and this is due to them adding mods as some mods will conflict with other mods and prevent the game running or working properly...please add and test 1 mod at a time before adding another mod and always make a backup copy of your saved file before adding, deleting, or altering anything.  If you buy this game it will be worth it and i will give it a thumbs up but i rate it 7 out of 10 and when this game is improved i will give it a higher rating.  Hope you enjoyed my review and i hope it helps you.",

            "review_text": "Even real farmers play Farming Simulator! Whilst it is still a little way from being a simulator in the true sense of the word (for example, gears are not fully simulated, tractors do not show real damage, crops grow too fast and its a bit too easy to make money), nevertheless, the positives far outweigh the negatives, and for every weakness, there are many realistic features. It's great fun if you have any interest in farming and you like the productive strategy type game rather than the fast paced shooters. I worked on a farm many years ago, and I played with Britains farm toys as a kid. This game, 40yr later, allows me to own and drive any type of tractor &amp; implement, and farm any crop, &amp; the physics and graphics are easily good enough to bring back the memories of driving the real thing. Giants also give good support, they updated FS2013 regularly, so I hope to see the same improvements and developments in this one;and they offer good (many free) addon mods form time to time. It's also very moddable, so if there is an aspect that lets the game down, it is very likely that someone has added a mod to fix it, or else you can do it yourself. For example, it is not difficult to edit the start machinery and funds, or to change growth rate or values to make the game more difficult, or even to create your own map with a bit of learning.  Stand by to be labelled a farm nerd (similar to trainspotter), but that matters not to me. Excellent game, worth at least 8 out of 10 on release, and expecting that to rise with future patches. :)",

It’s like the billionaire Warren Buffett says, “the more you sow, the more you grow.”  Now maybe you’ve seen my tedder talk where I talk about how I dry and windrow 17 cubic miles of grass every day. You know, I dry and windrow 17 cubic miles of grass every day not to show off, again it's about the cows. In fact, the real reason I keep this Lamborghini Mach 230 VRT here is that it’s a reminder. A reminder that dreams are still possible, because it wasn’t that long ago that I was in a little farmstead across the map driving a tiny little Sampo Rosenlew Comia C6 with only 185 horsepower. I didn't even have any chickens. I had no opportunities.",

            "review_text": "In short, FS15 is better/improved in every way to any of its predecessors, therefore I recommend the game (overall rating 7/10).   Physics (6/10): They say its a new engine, however it does feel a lot like the old one in many ways, but some major improvements like not so 'floaty' objects (tractors still go airborn when driving over small hills at 30 km/h though), solid AI vehicles and the machines actually loosing speed when going uphill and gaining speed going downhill are some VERY good improvements.  It still has the 'bouncy' physics which for some parts doesn't matter but for other parts are downright annoying and makes the game hard to actually play sometimes.  There're some sort of 'magnet' feature that steps in to aid the player in placing things like the scorpion king cutter by the tree so u don't have to be 100% precise with that.  Also when grinding trunks the same thing happens when u place logs on the conveyer belt and the end of the log comes close to the grinder unit.  Sometimes you feel the 'magnet' feature works for you, while other times it seems to work straight against you.  Due to the physics engine, log handling is very frustrating at times, somewhere around 50% of the time actually and things like the grinder than tends to bounce the logs all over the place are truly annoying, especially as once the end of a log bounces higher than the grinding unit and back down, the grinder no longer treats it as if its for grinding, it kinda ignores it somehow and the log will just lie there on the moving conveyer belt without being affected by it.   Controls (5/10): Im using an XBOX One controller via USB and FS15 is prepared for that, it even has some default controller scheme for it that works pretty bad, because none of the machines are controlled like you'd expect them to, for starters, the wheel loader has the arm up/down set in a way so u cant drive and steer while controlling the arm.  If u reconfigure the controls, then you cant set it up so the controls are correct for all machines and that's due to the way the controls are tied together, so if u set the wheel loader so the right stick controls the arm and bucket (like on a real wheel loader), your controls for cranes will become wrong and vise versa.   Gameplay (8/10): The machines way of deploying power is way better than in older FS games, so far I haven't experienced the scenario of a smaller tractor being more powerful than a bigger (higher HP) tractor, so now it actually pays to buy the tractor suitable for the given job, instead of just finding that one tractor that does it all better than any other tractor.  The logging part they added is nice, because it offers you to take a break when you get fed up by the repetitiveness of sowing and harvesting and you also makes so that you can do some logging during harvest so that you wont just sit around watching the hired worker fill up the harvester.  They also added the 'no withering' option so when enabled, your crops wont wither and that makes it possible to actually have several fields and maintain them all without the risk of loosing the crop if not harvested in time.  In addition, it doesn't force you to attend to those fields until you feel like it.   Stability (8/10): I find the game to be VERY stable, ive had one crash only so far and that's after the game has been running for days where Ive played up to 8 hrs straight, then paused and tabbed out and used the computer for other purposes.   Bugs/exploits (6/10): There are bugs obviously and some of them are more annoying than others, but so far I haven't encountered any game breaking bugs.  In regards of exploits, there're plenty, especially when it comes to logging, but working the exploits soon becomes dull and boring and somehow the money grinding is more giving, though it returns less money in the game, but instead of seeing it as right or wrong ways to play the game, I started to see it as 'freedom of choice' to play the game the way you want to play it.  Because maybe not everyone will enjoy every money grinding part of the game and in order to get some fast starters cash, they might prefer a little exploiting just to earn enough to get them going with what they wanna do and hence, spare them the boredom of doing what don't catch their interest in order to play the game.   Graphics (8/10): The graphics are good and consistent, most objects has been completed into fine details and just like when you have a meal, if it looks good, its just a better experience than if it doesn't, even though the taste is the same.   Conclusion is, that there're plenty of room for improvements, but the game in its current state is very much worth the price.  Its actually one of those games where id be prepared to pay twice the price if the physics were just that more refined so that things like the grinder would work flawlessly.  Regardless, there're many many hours of entertaining gameplay to be had.  Enjoy! :-)",

            "review_text": "Farming Simulator 15 developed by GIANTS is the best game I've ever purchased. My addiction started back in 2012 when 2013 came out. I purchased it, and then I had gotten to 198 hours before 15 came out. I loved 2013 so much, but 15 really was a big improvement with logging. The graphics and overall performance of the game is excellent, and it runs perefect on most mid range laptops/desktops. I personally like the ability of modding the game with modded maps, tractors, implements, semis, trailers, tillage, soil mods, texture mods, plant mods, etc., created by other people. The modding is the best part, in my opinion.   Another thing I really like is multiplayer. I would like to put out that I've met 3 friends and have continued to play with them. Believe it or not, I have connected with them on other forms of social media (Facebook). Another one of them actually has my mobile number, and we text regularly. :) It just makes me happy because where I live, no one listens to me and I don't really have ANY friends. So when I'm not at school, I can come home and get on my computer and play/connect with my friends that I don't have where I live. This just shows the power of this game and how it has changed my life. I actually loved the previous version so much that I preordered 15, and also have purchased the Gold expansion recently only because it was on the Christmas sale, and I had left over money after another purchase.  If you read all that or not, it doesn't matter much. No matter what I will ALWAYS recommend this game to any patient person who is willing to wait for things. I would mostly recommend to any fellow farmers out there.  This is my full review of Farming Simulator 15 the game for PC by GIANTS. If this inspires you to purchase this game, I'm very happy about that. PLEASE support GIANTS for what a great game they have created. Their game changed my every day life. It just might change yours too. :)",

Well you're wrong this game has given me many weeks worth of fun, from the forestry to the simple growth of conola and then selling it to get more equipment. This game has to be rated 10/10 and it's worth a buy if you and your friends like a long and hard grind yet fun with the multiplayer aspect, note you can change the grow speed which makes the grind bit go away. I never looked for glitches so I myself never found any, Personally I would love it if they made the house useable and I know its pointless but it would be fun to have a cook what you grow system to! Then you could also have sleep fatigue, lifestyle needs and so on. My list would ruin this review so remember if you like to have fun try this game!",

Multiplayer servers have been solid, not to mention the fun of farming with others. Utilizing the option of placeable objects can enhance your economy or dominate it. Mods are available, I love my monster truck and have spent time jumping off mountains and hills with it while waiting for my crops to grow. My friends and I have even had truck races when we was just too plum tired to farm after a hard nights work. The hours go by fast playing this one, so if you take the plunge, be prepared to be forced to logoff and go to bed when you really dont want to. Expansions are available and more to come.

It's extremely easy to cheat (edit saved game in your fav text editor, win). The physics can sometimes be frustrating. Some game elements aren't explained at all and left for the user to try to figure out. This would be fine if those things were intuitive but they're not. Oh, and operating various lifts and boom tools can leave you wanting to throw your PC OR Mac out the window. And despite all this, the product is still FUN. It's not great. It's not that epic. You're limited to what you can do with it.

So I parted with my cash and took a step into the world of FS2015.  It is just sublime, the machinery models and animations are spot on, and the earning curve for cash allows you to slowly build up a nice suite of machines. Managing multiple helpers around the map doing tasks whilst trying to keep the crops growing and finding new ways to earn cash actually becomes quite hectic.  As a negative, a little more info about crop growing, improving yields etc would be useful.... but hey.. that's what the community is for.  FS2015 works brilliantly with a controller and once you get your head around the multiple button combo system for functions it enhances the vehicle handling.... and you can even drift tractors.... ish!  It is one of the best sand box sims I have played, and I hope the developers keeping pushing what they can do with the subsequent releases.",

I tested it out by crashing into everything at full speeds and into other vehicles being driven by the AI and I do not go flying up into the air, twirling about and getting stuck upside down anymore!  For anyone who says driving is like 'being on ice', when you have a heavy load or trailer connected to your tractor, attach a weight to the front. It will weight it down and stop the sliding. The issue is that you have all that weight on the back so when you turn at speed the front end lifts a little bit and you lose traction.  Ive played FS11 and FS13 and this is so far better than either. Only downside is that 1 map is new and 1 map is the American town from the FS13 Titanium Expansion. But that's no issue to me, there's some great modders and world creators out there so I look forward to them and official DLC from Giants. 9.5/10 (-.5 for reusing an old map in a new game)",

Anyway, after a game of air hockey impressing her with my hockey skills, she invites me back to hers. Unfortunately, this meant ditching josh. Too bad, josh.  We got there, i was expecting a caravan site but i was met with a huge house, probably the biggest house on the street! I thought 'Great, she's rich too!' We went inside and I met her mother, who seemed great, no sign of a father or brother. I assumed this was it.  We went upstairs and into her room. I noticed a few strange things in there, like the stuffed puffer fish hanging from her window handle, and a collection of 20 'annabelle-like' dolls that surrounded her room, but apart from that the giant satan star on her bedroom floor was quite fitting.  It was at this point she pulled out her sacrificial knife and asked if she could offer my soul to satan, i declined by punching her in the kidneys, launching myself out of her bedroom window like a frisbee and landing safely in my car. I drove away as quickly as i could, never to see her again.  After buying Farming Simulator 2015 i regret the decision i made that day, because 40 hours of this game sucked out my soul and sold it to satan anyway",

            "review_text": "Was hesitant about buying this upfront because it seemed pretty boring, but it's actually a very good game that sucks you in. There's no real story, you're just farming and try to make more money to buy better equipment to make the farming easier and/or quicker.  The selection of two maps is not a lot of choice, but they're two really good maps with plenty of variation and ability to play for many, many hours on end.   There's some form of getting started tutorial built in to the game, but it does lack quite a bit of information if you're nwe to the series. For some of the more advanced parts of the game you'll need to either figure it all out yourself just by trying random things, or close the game to search the web.   With the available mods (tons of 'm) you can get new equipment, maps and even advanced tools that allow you to fully automate your farming. My personal favorite way of playing this is to automate the most repetitive actions with the hired helpers as well as mods like FollowMe and CoursePlay, while focusing my own time mostly in making sure things overall run smoothly and to expand the farm. The modded maps I've tried so far though tend to be harder (not necessarily in a good way) than the core maps. Either you constantly get stuck because there is a tree in the middle of a field or too close to the field edge, or the farm is so tiny you can hardly manouvre around with the bigger tippers to drop off the harvest. Overall though the mods really add to the game, so it's worth exploring those.   Things I don't like about the game:  - Small selection of high quality, well tested maps - Have had a few crashes (from looking at the logs this appears to be from a mod crashing and taking the game with it) and lost quite a bit of progress because this game sucks you in so bad you forget to save every now and then and the game does not autosave. There's a mod for that though!  Things I do like: - Works nicely (aside from those mod crashes) on both my PC and MacBook Pro (which does tend to get quite hot after a bit) - Extensive mods available, and lots of resources on wikis and YouTube.  - Whenever driving by a farm I recognise equipment or know what they're doing now.  - Co-op multiplayer. Would be interesting to also see a versus mode though, to compete against friends in building a farming empire on the same map.",

Yes folks, this is what you can expect from Farming Simulator 15.   I didn't know the first thing about farming, but liked the idea of building an empire in a small open world. I'd seen some streams, and the streamers seemed to enjoy themselves...so I jumped in thinking it would be a fun diversion.  Thirty hours of instant addiction later I'm an unshaven, scraggly mess of a man; swearing when I overturn my tractor and gathering chicken eggs in my spare time. Recently I've begun the descent into 'silage,' which is basically fermented grass that is becoming liquid gold in the era of biofuels. Soon it will be time to graduate into cows and forestry, at which point I will have abandoned all pretense of city life and run off for life as a farmhand.   It's been nice knowing you all.",

So what are some Pros? Good question i will tell you: 1. The Graphics are SUPERB. the best of any farming sim game to this date, and i have been playing the franchise since 2009(then on a crappy laptop). The Graphics max out on my 770 perfectly, so i get absolutely no stutters. 2. The speedometer's actually work! Yes they do work, that was the first time i have seen it and i LOVE it. i can finally drive inside and fell like im driving a car, not a metal box with crappy picture version speedometers. 3. You actually have a TON of different tools at your disposal so that is much said over 2013 as they had few tractors. 4. You actually have turn signals. You can just cruise around and use your turn signals if you so choose. Some cons? 1. The game could have WAY more tractors and stuff. I feel they left a lot to be disired by not adding many tractors and combines from like John Deere and other U.S. Manufacturers. 2. You could do LED lightbars instead of rotating beacons. Huge downside that still lacks as this game is AWESOME. You should make it a option for money that you can add it to your vehicle. 3. A lot of the reviews are a little misleading as they say the tire tracks are much bigger then they really are. They are pretty small, but to be honest i dont care as long as i can see them  If you were like me and sat there FOREVER wondering if you should spend the money, then do it. IT IS WORTH IT! Best game of the year and it should get a award as in my opinion the game has got a whole overhaul that did the game great.",

If you didnt grow up on a farm, I would recomend taking full advantage of all tutorials before starting a carreer. After you sandbox a bit in a solo carreer, get online and get involved with a server with other players in order to pick up advanced gameplay features. There is, as yet, no real wiki out there (thats not in russian).

Previous Review:  Well heres a simple summary if your familiar with the series.  Pros: -Improved Gameplay over previous version -Great Graphics -Forestry added (Easy Money at the beginning of the game) -AI in my opinion is better -Can now have the AI control more tasks (fertilizing)  Cons: -Gravity a bit messed up for vehicles, can flip them easily -Trees do not obey gravity either, pretty sad when forestry is a part of the game (do not fall when cut, will spin on the ground for long periods, branches do not hold the tree off the ground) -Limited Vehicles and Mods (Extra $$ for DLC I'm sure...)  Small improvements over SIM14, would wait till it goes on sale or more content comes out, your really not missing much if you have SIM14 already.",

This game will sound boring on the surface but it is better than it sounds. The best part is it is all you. No score (other than income). No killing (although there's a mod that lets you grow weeds and use herbicide). You can sit back and grow crops, fertilize them, harvest them, wait for the best time to sell, then rake it in. Meanwhile, you are mowing grass to ferment into silage (big money maker) or making it into hay. Then there's cattle to feed, eggs to pick up, and wool to move. Use mods to raise calves, pigs, and broiler chickens, too.  There's big huge tractors with touch screens and there's older models that go slower than Christmas.

It takes a lot of time to make a good farm and get all the machines and tools you need to do everything, but it feels rewarding once you do.

            "review_text": "This game has tons of driveable vehicles and tools that you can attach to vehicles (e.g. tractors) in order to do several tasks in the day-to-day operations of you farm (e.g. harvesting fields). You literally have to drive (or walk which is much slower) to get from place to place. On the one hand, this adds to the realism of the gameplay. If you want to sell crops, you really have to get your truck, fill it with the crop from your silo, and drive all the way to any of the many locations on the map that will buy the crop. Much more realistic than just pressing a button on-screen and, voila, your crops are instantly gone and sold. This is great since you really have a feel that you're doing the work and not the game itself.  On the other hand, however, some aspects of the game that attempt to add 'realism' sometimes just annoys me. Most of the tools in the game are in the form of 'attachables' that attach to either the rear or the front of tractors. No matter how small or light these tools are, you just have to drive your tractor and precisely aim either its rear or front onto the part of the tool to where it will attach in order to attach the tool into your tractor and use it. Heck, even the help function, you can say 'realistic', is starting to annoy me. It's in the form of a phone booth where you can call a 'helpline' to ask for help, giving you the basics of the different aspects of gameplay. So you have drive or walk to the different points in the map where the phone booths are to get help. Although there are usually hints at different locations in the game, telling you what a specific location is used for, this still annoys me. Would a simple help menu be so damaging to the realism of the gameplay?  Another thing: While the agricultural process (plowing, sowing, harvesting) is relatively complex, I can't say the same for the poultry process which I think is too simplistic compared to the rest of the game. You buy chickens which automatically add up in your chicken farm. Then, they just run around there while you collect the eggs that they drop by simply walking around the farm, 'collecting' the eggs. You sell the eggs in places that are marked on the map and earn money. Sure, I think this is the more traditional way of doing this but I would have expected much more from a game that offered combine harvesters in the agricultural process.  Another thing: The game actually relies on machinery to do most things. As far as I know, the only thing that you can actually do on your own (i.e. not operating any sort of vehicle) is cutting down trees (using a chainsaw) and picking up the chicken eggs (you just need to walk towards an egg to pick it). So the vehicle switching feature where you press TAB and you instantly cycle throughout all the vehicles is a lifesaver although it can begin to be cumbersome when you accumulate a lot of vehicles. It is you that teleport to the vehicle; the vehicle doesn't go to you so you still have to drive all the way from where you came from if the vehicle is far away. I would have appreciated a better system of going through all the vehicles and tools since it can begin to be annoying if you're doing a lot of stuff in your farm and you discover that the other tool you need is on the other side of the map and you have to drive it all the way to your work area. You don't have any sort of 'hammerspace' where everything you need you can instantly get by pressing a button (save for the chainsaw). If you need a vehicle or a tool, you have to get to it. And this is the part where it kind of becomes annoying since, as I've said, in virtually anything you want to do you'd have to get a vehicle or a tool that you'd attach to a vehicle. I really would have appreciated a much easier way of going through all the vehicles and tools, even at the expense of some realism because let's face it, no realistic farm is run by one person only.  Speaking of that, I appreciate the 'Hire Worker' feature where you can automate the the plowing, sowing, and harvesting of crops by 'hiring a worker' and paying him to do the work for you. All you have to do is drive the vehicle to the position in the field were you want to start and hire the worker and the game will do the rest for you, completing the task on that field, granted that there are no obstructions to the vehicle. Again, I would have appreciated greater options for the hire worker feature, say automatically driving a vehicle from point A to point B.  Overall, I'd rate the game an 8/10.",

In Farming Simulator 15, you enter your combine [you start with a Comina C6], attach the header [if you haven't already], unfold the harverster, lower the pickup, and then drive as straight as you can --- or hire a driver to do it for you. As it fills up, you can offload into a trailer and drive it it to your grain silo. Playing this game I learned why farmers attach weights to their tractors, the difference between straw and hay, and that plows really aren't used as often as cultivating machines.   I will use 'moderate' to describe the level of detail in the simulator. For someone who is not a farmer, I found the game to have a satisfying level of depth and detail -- but a purist might be disappointed that the controls you see in the cockpit view of the tractors are non-functional. Similarly, reversing a tractor connected to a dolly connected to a trailer was realistictly difficult -- but I think in the real world if I drove a semi off of an 8-foot drop, I would not be able to continue on my merry way with a full load of grain.   Recommended if for no other reason than it convinced me I do not want to be a farmer.",

I know there were a lot of mods for the previous version for that. The selection of equipment is different with some items (such as the Ursus Bale Wrapper) being in your store automatically, and others (Like the BigM 500 Mower) being nowhere to be found. It's a good balance of new and old equipment and a good balance that should have you running your farm with no real equipment issues.   The major 2 cons that I've noticed so far seem to have to do with the physics interaction between equipment and environment. First off, skidding. I've never seen a combine go skidding or do a donut in the field in real life. In this game there doesn't seem to be any kind of code written for 'traction'. I mean, even the Case Quad Trac (which is basically an agricultural tank) can skid out of control on a whim. The second is that stopped equipment doesn't quite stop. When I park my harvester to grab a trailer to unload and pull back up to the combine it has normally slid about 4-6 feet forward. By the time I'm done unloading the thing I usually have to back it up about 20 feet to be able to not leave a huge swath of unharvested crop.   That's about the only thing that I can complain about. It looks a LOT better than the previous incarnation and plays (for the most part) better as well. Just hoping they fix those little things, which I'm sure they will in future patches.   EDIT: 4/6/2015:  LOTS of the bugs have been ironed out so far. Honestly the only one that I haven't seen improvement on is the equipment sliding when unloading. But at least my combine isn't doing 360s in the field anymore when I go to turn it! Still highly recommend and still hoping the sliding problem is addressed. Wonder if it has to do with the removal of 'downforce' from the code?",

It's the type of game where you want to do just 'that 1 more thing' and suddenly realize it's already 1 am and you have to get up early ;) So this was my first farming game and I really enjoyed it. I was really surprised not only by how much fun it is to harvest virtual crops, but especially by the high quality of the game. I have played many other simulations, which are perfectly realistic but are just very buggy or simply unenjoyable, because of bad usability. Not FS15 though! Very solid game with no game-breaking bugs in my experience. It's more of an educational game than a simulator though. You get to know the farming machinery and the required steps to run a farm. But a lot of it is simplified for the sake of playability. This is the reason for many negative reviews, because many hardcore fans find that the game does not go deep enough in terms of farming mechanics. But I think it is also the reason for this games' success, because the developers want to make the game accessible for the average person instead of catering to people with real-life farming experience. I learned a lot about farming from this game and whenever I drive through the countryside in real life, I see farms with completely different eyes now. If you don't know much about farming, you should definately try out this game. You don't have to be a farming enthusiast to have a fun time with this game.",

The farming simulator line of games (2011-13) have always suffered badly from janky physics taking effect on your vehicles and although there is a a wealth of mods to help reduce the effect there is still a 'milk float like' drivability to the in game machinery. However one thing this game does do very well, is animation, all of the vehicle models are expertly crafted, all the parts on the equipment works much like their real world counterparts.   Maybe you want to farm animals, you can do that, maybe you want to grow and harvest crops, you can do that too, there is even a substantial forestry element to this game. Don't let my playing hours fool you, I've played over 300 hours on one save unfortunately steam dosent record offline hours. I've played enough to stay interested for 400+ hours overall. Then when I got bored I would go and download mods from the wealth of online modding sites like lsmods and such. Currently I have 4,278 folders in my 'mods' folder. I've checked through each one, deleted all the sub-par ones and kept all of the high quality of useful ones.   If you are like me then you will love to play 'single' brand games where you develop a farm using only 1 brand of equipment, the mods help greatly with this as the cheapest CaseIH tractor is the 200Bhp puma and as a small farm tractor it is not ideal for starting out. When you start playing you may not understand everything, I discovered just 2 weeks ago that I had missed and entire part of the game which was creating silage with bales and hay turners, (I know stupid right) I have also only just started using manure spreaders and slurry tankers and that's with over 400 hours of game play time.   When you start up your first game you will think the goal is to have all the best machinery, lots of animals and a thriving forestry industry but realistically this will not be an opportunity available to you until you are very late into the game (e.g. 150 hrs+) so I recommend focusing on supportin one industry for the first section while you gain profit then make a move into other industries when you have the coin to buy decent equipment. Trust me I made the mistake before of trying to build up with every industry however you will find it very difficult to support all the machinery required while still turning s profit unless you play on easy of course!   Overall very solid game, more recommended for when you have long periods of time free to develop your farm gradually. ",

Nothing like hitting a small bump and watching all the logs you put on a trailer go flying in all directions. It's enough to make one alt+F4. Big modding community helps when the game becomes stale. All in all it is a solid game despite some physics bugs.",
