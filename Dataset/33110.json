However this game feels like a quick money grab since its almost exactly the same as the original game. If you already have Alien Shooter 1 already rather stick with it and dont look at getting Revisited. Additionally the game has one of the WORST camera's ive had the misfortune of dealing with. My advice is rather stick with AS 1 or AS2.",
