The gameplay is very fun, you manage various stats of your kickpuncher (but in a lot less intrusive and nagging way than in games like sims) and then you send him to wallop opponents in legal and not so legal rings. You train, you buy food and of course you also need to work. Money does not grow on trees. Brexit.  In fights you play the role of a trainer rather than that of a fighter. You build the stats and set the skills (Which you pick from several skill trees) and Steve Rambo surrenders himself to the RNG Gods.  Game is full of references to both modern and retro fiction, shout out to lads who understand the briefcase.  The aesthetic aims to emulate that arcade feel, even offering scanline-ish filter as an option. Personally i don't use it but i know that it will rock socks off some of you cool kids out there. You cool kids with your walkmans and your fanny packs.  I give the game a rating of: Heeey that's pretty good.",

            "review_text": "Punch Club is a very unique blend of fighter and RPG. I cannot off the top of my head recollect another title I would count as its peer. That said, it would be important to evaluate it purely on its own merits and not attempt to compare it to any previous offering. That too is a unique opportunity.  What is Punch Club then? Well it's more of a management sim than anything else. The RPG elements are strong but the majority of your input in this game is balancing your fighter's activities to build up for the fights. The skill trees are interesting and present some real head-scratching moments where you'll be making some very defining choices for your fighter.  I beat this game in about 9 hours. For a $10 game, that's not outside of what I would have expected. The grindy nature of the game became VERY apparent in the final two to three hours of gameplay. The novelty of the training and balancing your other activities will be gone by them time you're building up to your final ten fights. There are some missed chances for some more cinematic presentations for those final fights too. The opponents are less generic and it would have been an excellent opportunity to have special entrances, custom music, or maybe even mid-fight events. Instead they become just another stepping stone to concluding the story. At that point in the game, you've likely locked down your fight strategy so the probability that you're actually making meaningful adjustments is low. Essentially you'll just be trying to maintain your stats between fights, and twiddling your fingers until the next match.  The exploration and story elements in the first half of the game are extremely solid. You are introduced to a number of characters and branching story lines that allow you to spend some time outside of the organized fights. Unfortunately that pace falls off about 60% through the game and it finished on a wimper rather than a bang.  For $10 I would recommend the game for those looking for something a bit different. Don't expect a long and immersive experience, but a fun and interesting short one.",

Great movies, characters, and what have you in the backgrounds as posters/tv shows/etc. Just keep on the look out and you might find yourself having a nostaliga overload.  The constant grind for food/energy/cash can get to be a little grind-y especially with trying to keep up your stats for fighting. You Have to train *every day* otherwise your stats take a hit, and that can be really hard to do if you don't keep any spare money on you for the gym, or food.

The music and SFX are good and there is a crazy amount of great pop culture and oldschool references both in the game's story, characters, and visual art.  It's not the longest game, taking me about 15 hours on the first playthrough. There can definitely be grind periods where the game is repetitive and boring but that is the nature of SIM games, so don't get discouraged if at first things don't work out.  The combat system is fairly simple, only requiring you to choose your skills before the fight and then having the actual fight work on auto-pilot off of character stats. It can get quite boring at times to watch a 2 minute fight that you know you're going to either win or lose in the first 20 seconds but thats one of the few negative things I have to say about this game.",

That being said, there is a lot wrong with this game.   It's very punishing if you take any time off training because of stat decay. I understand that's kind of how time management games work, is you strive to find a healthy balance. This game however sometimes forces you into situations where you have no choice but to sit there and watch your stats decay because you have to do other things. You just constantly feel like you're being punished.  On to the topic of skill trees. They are very unbalanced, and some skills (a lot of skills), are just plain bad. AGI based builds are pretty much king, let me tell you, you're going to loathe fighting AGI based opponents who have certain skills, if you're not AGI based yourself. STR based builds are ok, but you really have to work a lot harder at finding that perfect skillset than with AGI. STA based builds are just a joke. Way of Turtle skill tree is just really bad as a primary skill tree. It'd be good as a secondary skill tree if you actually grinded out that much.  I will say the devs have patched a couple of things already to fix some of the complaints, so more fixes for stuff like this will probably be coming, but as of now, that's how it stands.

I found myself driven more by wanting to advance in the story than just wanting to make my fighter better, which is odd for me for this type of game. With that said, the story is serviceable and advances just quickly enough so that the game does not get stale.  The story advancing is important because otherwise, the gameplay is somewhat repetitive. You will find yourself trying to balance working, training, and fighting, but once you find that balance, the game becomes tedious. The gameplay loop remains relatively unchanged. One of the driving factors in the game is trying to unlock that next move (which is essentially a card that you can use in a fight) or perk to see how that affects your fights. Fights themselves become more interesting as you unlock more moves and perks, but you will find a set of moves that works well for your skillset and essentially stick to those moves.   The end game is very grindy, and it took a lot of will to power through the grind to see the end. Even with how grindy and tedious the game can become, I still enjoyed my time with the game. I don't see myself coming back to this, but I got my money's worth.",

            "review_text": "** This game gets incredibly grindy towards the last half of the game and kind of loses the management sim aspect of the first half, so dont buy if you dont want to grind out numbers**    If i hadnt already fell in love with the over the top ridiculously 80's feel (In the options you can make the game have retro pixelated graphics for the real 80's arcade vibe) along with all of the little refrences to good movies, comics, TV shows and games i would have an entirely different opinion on how good or bad this game is. The first half of the game is where it really shines as a management sim / rpg / glorified rock'em sock'em robots spectator sport. Unfortunately the last half of the game loses its perspective and just turns into watching numbers go up and down until you get the ones you need to beat the other guys higher numbers taking all of the skill out of it. If the Devs would lower the amount of points you lose per day and make the game less grindy it would double the fun factor but they wouldnt want people to finish their game in like 2 or 3 hours so they'll never do that.  I will note though that the game is a lesson that to become physically fit and stay in shape you constantly need to train in different areas and make sure not to get complacent just grinding out the same thing. If you ever go to a gym you'll hear they have things like 'Arm day' or 'Leg day' you alternate just enough to build on the muscles a day or so prior. If you abscent mindedly look around waiting while your guy trains he will start gaining less and less from doing that activity and use more food/energy doing it. What you need to do is cycle through the whole gym doing a little bit of each to keep the gains high and burning through food and energy low. This may confuse some people that play the game thinking that its just showing you how much time you have left on that workout, but the developer has confirmed that you are in fact LOSING a percentage of each gained bubble.   I didnt expect this game to subtlety try and teach you how to work out effectively. I also didnt expect how damn difficult it is to buy and keep food in the fridge when your also trying to stay the most physically fit for your upcoming fights. You also may have to swap out your abilities mid fight because while your stamina is high the other guy may be doing way waaaay more damage and dumping all your defensive ♥♥♥♥ in order to push for the win is the best course of action, Each skill tree has something that counteracts the other two so making sure your not taking block when the guy your going up against has something that goes through 40% of your blocked damage. Taking the time between rounds to switch out these things and seeing what works will net you a solid victory and not get your ♥♥♥ whooped.  This game says to me that to stay still or to put your nose to the grinder is the worst thing to do so to avoid that you need to step back, assess your options, try to keep an open mind and dont get tunnel vision....like a real fighter. A true fighter is not a mindless emotionless thug but a well oiled machine that is more a lifestyle and less a interest or hobby you watch on UFC because everyones on the bandwagon.    Overall its a fun game for $10 but if you are the type of person who was looking for a deep game that needs constant attention being a fighters coach you would be barking up the wrong tree. Its more of a Ipad type game that you'd play on the toilet. As i said at the start if spending days and days grinding out numbers would bore you to tears id steer clear of this game too. Its a charming casual rock'em sock'em robots game that just needs a hip 80's kid with spikey hair to play it in a commercial.  Can you maintain a life, make a epic montage about being an underdog athlete, and still find the time of day to romance Adrian to become the hero this city needs? thats up to you my friends",

            "review_text": "its... interesting, i guess. a sim game that follows a fighter who must compete in many fights to reach the top and solve the mysteries of his father.  Pros: +fights are satisfying the way the fighting system works is basically an rng cage match where you select certain moves to give to your character each round. in the fight, each move is selected at random, and there are also passive benefits you can use in battle. after every fight, you get a certain amount of 'skill points' which can be used to select certain benefits to help you in battle. more on those later.  +effective stat system in order to effectively win fights, you have to train up in three different stats: endurange, agility, and strength. you can do pushups in your garage to train all three at one, go to the gym and train with different methods, or go to your job and make money (as well as a small amount of stats). each stat has a skill tree you can spend your skill points on to level up specific aspects of your most dominant stat. for example, levelling up the agility tree gives you access to new and better dodges, counterattacks, kicks, and a 'copycat' move that mimics the actions of your enemies. this system creates the different 'builds' that you can follow, and it incentivizes specializing in one skill. i like this a lot.  +branching story &amp; different endings there are multiple alignments you can follow in the game, but obviously i can't go very in-depth on them. it's pretty subtle and you have to actively follow the story and stay pretty engaged to get the ending you want. it adds a level of replayability to the game alonside the different skill builds. it's nothing as deep as undertale, but its pretty cool nonetheless.  Cons: -grindy as all hell if you don't like grinding and watching a number increase slowly, then this game is not for you. the only way to increase stats legitimately is to watch your character do pull-ups and hit a tire with a hammer for a long time. it's pretty similar to runescape in the sense that you can feel the difference when your stats are higher, but the process of getting there is boring as ♥♥♥♥.  -lackluster story, and lots of spelling errors the story isn't really that great either. next to none of the characters are even remotely memorable, and due to the pacing of the game, you can go entire in-game weeks without advancing anything forward, so it feels like you can't get any further. another thing to mention is the large amount of spelling errors in the dialogue and the names of the enemies. it just feels like the game was pushed out a week early and many minor mistakes weren't fixed. it's far from a dealbreaker for me personally, but it's an issue that should be fixed.  overall, i like the game, even if it's a little unpolished. at it's core, its an rpg that satisfies a need to grind. the combat is exciting and interesting, the skill system is pretty deep, and those who can look past the story will find a 10$ gem to burn some time on.",

The game play is a lot like any other turn based game except you have no control over which order your moves are used. It's a 'manager' type game in which most everything is automated. This didn't take away from the game much though. All in all it was a silly and fun time waster, the pop culture references were fun and anything that involves working out im game for.  However, the story line was pretty weak/nonexistent. I definitely felt like there was going to be more story to the game and then how the storyline plays out was a big disappointment.

(Unless you like fighting yourself, because you have no control over your characters attack patterns or combos. As far as I know at least.) In this game you play as a kid whos dad was shot by an unknown man, and without spoiling the plot to much, involves a mysterious medallion which your father told you to hold on to for whatever reason.  Fighting (Probably the most important part of the game): You can select the kidns of attacks you want to use and methods of protecting yourself, one turn you select dodge, and karate kick. The other maybe soemthing else. However, you do NOT control your character beyond this during a fight. It is completely up to lady luck, and the fighting is somewhat linear in that regard. After you select your actions your character will duke it out with your opponent. There's a stamina system as well. Your actions cost certain amount of stamina, once you run out, if your enemy manages to hit you, you will be knocked to the ground doing extra damage. The higher yor characters strength the more stamina you spend for each attack. You gain some samina back after laying on the ground. There are no forms of KOs in this game, the only way to win is to beat the enemy outright, or have the most health when the match runs out of time. After each round you regain stamina, (Rounds are counted down through seconds during a fight) you will also get to select a new attack. Meanign you can vary up your strategys, but often you do not want to do this.  Different physichal skills. There are three attributes, strength, agility, and stamina. in that order. There are also four branches. basic skills, (Very balanced, leaning no way when it comes to skills.) way of the bear (Strength) way of the tiger (Agility) and way of the turtle (Stamina). These are all based on the attributes mentioned beforehand. Now you might be wondering, how do I obtain attributes? Well you have to work out. The main thing you'll be doing at the start is training at the gym. You gain skills by selecting a peice of equipment and training on it, this consumes a variety of status points as I call them from your character. I'll explain that later. You can not work out forever as well, you do run out of time and the day ends, once the day ends you lose your stats. So, it is very important you continue to work out. You can also do steroids, you cheating fiend.   Managing your charachters life: Welp, now its turned into sims. Just kidding your still playing punch club. Despite the way that first sentence might of sounded, I actually enjoy this. You have to go to a crocery store, and buy food, which is tored in your fridge automatically. This is where status poitns come into play. You have health which is lost during fights, food, which is lost through of variety of actions including sleeping and working out. Happieness, which can be gained through fights and watching TV. All of these are nescascary. You cannot work out without food or energy, and when you are sad, your workout efficiency is severely decreased. Health effects the amount of hit points you start each fight with. Low health equals lower HP. This all sounds very simple but it can get somewhat complicated, as you ahve to balance the needs of you character. There is also a tiem limit to each day, well, I owuldn't really call it a time limit per say, its more like paying taxes. You have to give up attributes at the end of each day, you lose time on the clock with every action you take, even going from place ot place. Lastly, money, which is important as well. You spend money on going to the gym, on food, steroids, and many other things. It is probably one of the most important parts of the game. So, in conclusion, I like this game a lot, it's also cheap! So buy it. Naow. Buy it naow. NAOWWWWWWWWWW!",

            "review_text": "UPDATED Review 3/8/2016 To the Point Scoring:  Mobile phone: Excellent way to enjoy this game. This is an ideal game to play on a mobile platform. I play this on the bus during my morning commute. 95/100   Console: 70/100 It is a bit too bland. Even a small mini game mechanic during fights would make the game more enjoyable for someone sitting at a desk getting their 'game on.' You will find yourself clicking and just watching a lot. For me, I prefer to play games with a little more meat on them when I have a good two - three hours of free game time. But to each his own, if you want to sit back and just click a bit, this game is for you.   Laptop/ Killing time: If you are playing on your laptop while trying to kill some time between a class, or waiting at an airport, the point and click adventure will entertain you while you wait for life to happen. 80/100    Extended Review: Now that the game is on mobile and the game mechanics have been tweaked, I feel the game deserves a better rating. Although the automated fight sequence is still bland and the animations haven’t changed, the developers have made the appropriate changes to the game play mechanics. The game still revolves around maximizing your workout efficiency. All things considered the developer has quickly addressed complaints about previous issues, and it seems they have put a lot of heart and soul into this thin yet strong boxing management sim.    Previous Review Written at Release (Thumbs down) A lot of plain old point and click.  You point and click, then fight. The fighting is automated, meaning you only watch your fighter. The match is a random roll to win system, except you have to sit through a series of random dice rolls. To train you need money, so you have to, guess what, chick to work. Then click to eat, chick to sleep, click to watch tv... Now your stats are gone.... lets go to the gym. Click the gym... Lets go buy gym equipment for cheaper trainning... Random thug wants to fight.... click ok... random bad roll, you lose you money... Click to work... you lose stats...   why am I playing this?   Would be better as a mobile app. Its a waste of time to play on a desktop when you can find better 'build'em up' games.",

The dialogue is perfect, there's bits of comic relief with different events, and really a solid game overall if you are into grinding skills and progressing in that form.  I do think the builds need some balancing, as a certain one seems very overpowered.  Additionally, I was happy to find a branching storyline, but upset to find that to unlock achievements for the other branch, I had to play through a LOT of gameplay to get to that point again, rather than having a save file system to let me load that point and make the other choice. I missed a whole section of story because I don't desire to go back and play this all the way through again right now. I will do it someday as the game is fun, but after grinding for so long to beat it, I needed a little break from it.

When the game starts, you get a little bit confused by the interface, but that's ok, because you learn how it works fast. Then you lose your first fight, get a few quests goin' and it looks like it's just gonna be smooth sailing til' the end. WRONG. The game f*cks you over so many times. You wanna get buff? Well you need food and sleep. Wanna get food? You don't have any money. Wanna get money? There's no problem with that, exept you get weaker by the day, and the only way for that not happening is by working out everyday. Also you need to pay every time you work out, unless you buy gym equipment for your house. But it wouldn't be like Punch Club without f*cking you over again.  If your money is 200$ or above, you can get robbed by robbers who should be at the top of the rankings of WWE, UFC and any other fighting league (also most gym equipment costs atleast 200$ so thats nice). You can avoid that by going to the store by bus, WHICH COSTS MONEY. Even if you get the equipment, you still need food, and sleep, which costs time, which makes you weaker. Also you cant stack up on food for the training, because again, the game hates you. You will lose most of your fights, but hey, this is the part where game gets a bit more fair and turns into a  GRINDFEST  at the same time. You get skill points by winning or losing fights (more by winning). You can use skill points to get new moves, make your stats not drop below lvl 4 (and more for your classes ability) and get passives.  'Hey that should be easy right?'. Well you're, kinda right...BUT STILL.  The game is way more grindy than it should be. Late game is gonna be everliving hell. The higher you are on your stat level, the more it drops per day. And i can tell you, the levels will reach up to 25 atleast.  The game is nice, but way too grindy. It will feel more like a chore than fun. It can be fun, if you are REALLY good with time-management, but for me, it felt laking.  Pros: &gt;Good references &gt;Nice pixel art &gt;The combat system is well designed and cool &gt;You will have a great time for the first 1 or 2 hours &gt;There is quite a bit of content &gt;Published by tinybuild &gt;EDIT:Workshop support  Cons: &gt;Grindfest &gt;Unfair &gt;Even though the combat is well designed, it's very RNG-based &gt;Gets boring in a while &gt;  Your best friend dies    The game is good for a quick time waster. You will even forget time exists, for the first few ingame days. I really want to like the game, but the flaws make me not to. I got this from humble bundle, so i didn't get that disapointed.

Every time I quit this game I feel like I've wasted my life. There's some strategy to it in how you select abilities when you level up but the training and grinding gets old very quickly.

            "review_text": "If you enjoy delivering pizza and getting robbed then by all means give it a try!  Honestly though, this game is on the borderline between 'could have been great' and 'throwing your keyboard at your screen', the game forces a vicious routine on you and it goes: work, sleep, eat, train and repeat. Early game is rough especially with robbers using their heightened senses to rob you if you ever have an amount of over 150(?). But you'll get past that point 'eventually...' I don't like the fact that you can't become well versed in all attributes kind of like a 'balanced boxer,' you are pretty much forced to go one attribute. Then you just have to train your boxer really hard in AGI, since its the only viable method to getting far, because Strength tires out fast and gets destroyed and stamina is decent, but you'll find yourself missing or hurting yourself with every punch you take.   Anyways, back on topic the game is basically this; you grind, grind some more, and when you get deeper into the game you grind even harder.   With several changes and fixes I could see this game being very enjoyable, but in the meantime it's literally just an unrewarding challenge, might as well go workout in real life where gains don't disappear so fast.  I rate 6/10  UPDATE:  One more thing I like to add is, after beating the game I was heavily disappointed you couldn't do anything else. I was excited since I invested a lot of time into my guy and then BAM, there's no extra objectives or more awesome fights, just one lackluster ending. I spent a lot of time training my character so he could fight and win so I would expect fights. But after beating the last guy it just ends, that's it, nothing more, like what... Very disappointing that there's no extra tournament, no survival (fight till you can't...), no defending your title, nothing. The replay value is extremely low due to grinding and there's no enjoyment to all that time training later in the game since it ends so fast. And the ending was pretty much crap and made little sense.  Changes I would like to see added:  - More fights, tournaments, title defense or something to spice up end game, because I mean you did all that training for it to amount to one fight and then its THE END, no enjoyment for your awesome character.  - More interactions, the one thing I felt this game did good at was the atmosphere, there were people to talk to and things to explore and unlock, just very little and I would like to see more added. It would be awesome if there were an extra map or more places added and more fighters/npc's. I mean you had BRUCE MIGHTY, where's Buck Norris (Chuck Norris BTW)? Why not add a gang's hideout or Don's faction so you can have more cool fights or optional things to do besides the daily grind.  - EASY/NORMAL/HARD mode, easy would be very low stat decay and starts with food and money etc. etc. Hard would have high stat decay and other restrictions, etc. etc.",

It kills the fun when you have to grind a stat for most of the (in game) day, just to see all your progress dissappear at the end of it.  There's a thread on the forums and you can see how the devs refuse to add a simple feature for disabling that mechanic when a considerable number of player are asking. It's dissapointing.  The game was fun for a couple of hours. I don't regret buying it on sale ($2.50). However it's a thumb down.  I would recommend to the developers (and players) to check Empire TV Tycoon as how to care for your fanbase.",

But when you use bus, and you get aggroed, you can't win because you spent all your time grinding money and your fighting skills are very low. So you lose half the money you just spent 10 minutes griding.  Maybe it gets better later on, when you can actually earn money by fighting and training gets you money somehow, but the early is too frustrating for me.

            "review_text": "I enjoyed a good part of this game, but I also found it incredibly frustrating. On the whole, the frustrations outweigh the fun.  For a fighting-style game, there is very little action. All you do is manage your training and choose fight tactics. I personally don't mind that, if it's done right. If you prefer action games, this is definitly not for you.  As far as your training goes, it is far too easy to fall into a vicious spiral. Here's the problem: your stats decrease every game day. The higher your stats, the greater the decrease. In the beginning, you need money to train, either to pay for the gym fee or to save up for your own home equipment. To make money you need to work, which decreases your energy. You then need to rest to refill your energy, which often takes you to the next day, which means your stats have just decreased. You can spend a lot of time spinning your wheels this way.  If you could save a lot of money, it would be no problem, but you cannot. The more money you have, the more likely you will be mugged by an RNG attacker. If you don't train then you will lose these fights and half your money in the process. Even if you DO train the RNG might still defeat you. I can't tell you how frustrating it is to spend two or three in-game days working to get enough money to afford a big-ticket item only to get mugged on the way to the store and basically have to start all over.  When you get to the actual combat,the game offers three different ways to build your character, but one is completely superior to the other choices. It's not even close. I tried to make my original build work, but I just got mired in that downward spiral I mentioned above. Once I changed builds, it became very easy, to the point I didn't even need to change my abilities or tactics.  There are also several minor annoyances that add up to more frustration. There's no way to speed up or advance text, as it just automatically scrolls. This adds unnecessary seconds to every conversation, every time you visit the store, every time you talk to your training partner, etc. Also, you spend most of your time training or working, and these seem incredibly slow. The game could go three times as fast without issue, but instead I'm stuck waiting for my guy to spend 30sec real time doing enough bench presses to make up for all the stats he lost 45sec ago.  The game has an interesting idea and has some potential, but it's current form is unbalanced, making it either trivial or agonizing. It's always frustrating. You can spend a lot of time without making any tangible progress. I can't recommend it in its current form, or at its current price. Especially it's current price.",

Also, it seems that the character you play with is basically toddler since he can't sleep/rest when he's hungry. And nothing he did made him happy, which affected his training.  I especially hated that meaningless stat-decay but I was still willing to tolerate it, at least until the latest update. It added the so called 'Suuuper easy' mode which removed the stat-decay but also the achievements for some reason. It felt like a childish move by the devs. Personally, I don't care much about achievements but I don't appreciate how they handled this.  It's obvious that some people enjoy the game as it is while others don't like the stat-decay and it's actually not *that* hard to please both, but the devs decided that instead, they should be passive-aggressive about the whole thing.   I have lost interest in the game with or without stat-decay and most certainly will not support them in the future..",

The game is mind-numbingly frustrating to me because I really wanted to like it, because it had everything going for it during my first hour of playing it. It has amazing pixel art, it has tons of 90s references which I always appreciate, but the gameplay...   Look, it's repetitive. That's not always necessarily a bad thing if the reward of doing said repetitive task was lucrative and rewarding, but it's really not. At the end of each in-game 'day' (each action you take in the game makes the in-game time go by faster depending on what you do), you lose some of your accumulated skill progress in each of your three main stats, and getting them back up is a matter of balancing your health, energy, happiness and hunger (as well as money). This can put you at a position in the game where you have no possibility of training your skills back up, because you're broke, hungry and tired. (Pretty realistic, right?)  No, except you can't sleep if you're hungry. No food in the fridge? Better work to get some money to buy food. Oh no that's right, you can't work your job if you're hungry even if you have the energy, the game just shuts you out mid-way through the process even if you had enough to start it up.   So you're hungry and tired, and no money since you can't work. Well, can you at least work on your base stats to keep in shape for upcoming fights? Don't be ridiculous, you can't pay the gym entry fee to do that. Or work to buy your own gym equipment, which if I might add, is a colossal waste of time and in-game money, it's better and more lucrative to always visit the gym. This might get you stuck, if you haven't progressed far enough to unlock the 'Bar' location on the map, or 'Roy's place' (because these two places give you the options of A) a trashy cheeseburger from a garbage can if you're hungry and need fuel for a job, and B) slowly watching your fighting stats deterioate as you slowly see your hunger and energy levels tick up, respectively)  There are a lot of more nitpicks I have with the game, but these are my main ones.

A fighter who loses stats daily. Yes, this can be mitigated. You buy food, sleep, work out, work, talk to a few people here and there, upgrade your home gym, participate in tournaments and generally sim it up pretty good. You never use the washroom or shower, but you have to keep your happiness meter high or your training suffers. That's all the non-idle stuff, mostly. Everything is accomplished with a click or two, then you watch and wait.  The worst part of the game is the actual punching. Kicking. Dodging. Blocking. Yes, the fighting. It's atrocious. You select some 'moves' and click start. Then you.... sit there and wait. A long time. Then the round ends. During the round you will lose some fatigue and some health, depending on what moves you picked and how many times your opponent hits you. Run out of fatigue and you seem to take a hard hit that does more damage (critical hit, maybe?) and knocks you on your back. But you sit there, waiting. Watching, sure, but you're not. Doing. Anything. The action oriented part of the game leaves you simply waiting on break between rounds where you can change your moves. Then click start again and..... ..... ....... ..... wait some more.  If the rounds went faster, it honestly wouldn't be so bad. But it's bad. And annoying. And boring. You watch fatigue + and - numbers and damage numbers pop up over the fighter's heads. They conveniently remain to the left and right sides of each other, never doing more than a few repetitive actions and often just standing there for a while waiting - just like you are!  Yeah, it's not great. I expected more. There's some depth here, and for the style they chose the graphics are decent. Sounds... meh, didn't really stand out as good or terrible, but they lean toward the latter a bit more than the former.  If you like idle games and watching your character just do things with zero input other than the click that gets them started, and I mean watching them for long, drawn out periods of time, then you might like this game. I found myself playing longer than I thought I would in my first go, but mostly because everything takes so damn long. Still, I played later into the evening than I should have so there is something addictive about this. But, then again, there's also something addictive about crack.",

You literally win or lose on a random number generator, with minimal gameplay required on the player's behalf. I out-leveled the 4th place newbie league guy in terms of stats and skills, and he, 5th, 6th AND 7th place consequently beat the living daylight out of me because my character refused to take a swing in a fighting game, despite having two punch moves. The story itself is standard to sub-standard, and over the course of what I played only went for the more bizarre. While some may like that, it was a bit too weird for my taste and I spotted some typo's and grammar issues in there as well (not exactly breaking, but not helping either). The only thing I really liked were the references in the game. To be brutally honest, it was a chore playing this game long enough to get the cards.",

The story from what I saw (which was only the opening cutscene, really) during the time I played was not very compelling and It didn't really give me ant motivation to play through the whole game to find out what happens in the end.  As far as the gameplay goes, there is not very much. As this is a 'time management' game and most of what you do consists of 'point here, click there, watch this', there just was not enough going on for me to want to spend 5 or 6 hours thinking about whether or not I should click the job place next or the gym.  In short, I don't really play these kind of games, I got this on Humble Bundle, and it really just wasn't for me.",

The story totally could've been interesting, but it's lacking a lot of events in between, not to mention that you're so busy trying to survive the stat reduction you might not even have time to do them. There's just SO. MUCH. GRIND. Everything in the world is against you; the random robbers event, the daily stat reduction, the ridiculous cost (probably dumped tens of thousand dollars into that god forsaken gym just to train and spar; how the hell is Silver not a billionaire already?), consumption rate, travelling time (somehow, the protagonist takes a full hour to walk ONE KILOMETER ONLY) and so on and so on.   In fact, I just don't see the point of playing through the game again with a different skillset - or as bad guy, which offers slightly different storyline and unlockable locations - because it took me 9 hours of crazy grinding - the end game actually features even WORSE, INSANELY REPETITIVE grinding, if you can actually believe it - to finally beat the game. The ending isn't even satisfactory; it leaves you with a cliffhanger and a storyline that confuse the hell out of people, and naturally there's no option to replay that particular cutscene because this is a 'retro' game. Uuuuuugh.  Also, someone mentioned in the discussions that this game is built around the concept of mobile F2P. I can see it, except that if it actually was F2P I would toss it out of the window in a milisecond. Even ZENONIA isn't as boringly grindy as this game, and that one's a KRPG.   As of now, I seriously cannot recommend this game to anyone. Yes, it can be fun. Yes, a core part of such sim games is to grind. But jesus, at least Sunrider Academy has boobs to look at (although that game's grind is even more pointless, at least it doesn't PHYSICALLY DISGUST ME WITH ITS MECHANICS). Heck even Love Dating Sim, a game since the 2000s EASILY trumps this game in terms of replayability and sheer fun. This one's just TEDIOUS, UNPRODUCTIVE WORK. I would play Pro Gamer Manager, an early access game with no end game over this. At least that one's relaxing.",

Accessing menus can be very buggy. I have a habit of using the ESC key to close down menus in games, if you use it in this one, the menu will be come unresponsive forcing you to close the game and reopen it. This has happened maybe 5 times in the hour that i played. Aside from that, it is very grindy. You have to constantly keep up with your stats to stay competitve with other fighters, while also getting rest, working for pay etc. It is an awesome concept, but in the end it just feels like i am doing a chore.   Pros  - Interesting concept that feels fresh to other sim/management type games. - Awesome art style/OST - Variety of skills from what i could see - Satisfying progression system  Cons - VERY grindy - Has some very annoying bugs - Reptitive - Lacking in content  This feels less of a 10$ title and more of a free phone game that should have microtransactions.

If you wanted a silly, well drawn, cathartic beat 'em up game, I've got good news - most of that is applicable here. Beating someone in a match is pretty cathartic and the plot at times can be pretty funny. But then there are the problems. First of all this is less of a beat 'em up game as it is a beat 'em up  management  game. While this didn't seem so bad at first (even though I felt a little gipped that I wasn't controlling the player in match), the end game was practically unbearable.   Secondly, and relatedly, the game just drags on you over and over. The central idea is smart - train, get stronger, and learn cool moves. But eventually it just becomes a chore, with little pay-off.   Thirdly, there were a couple bugs that made the game just a bit more annoying - for example, when I was working out, paused and minimized to do something else, and then reentered the game, I couldn't switch to another workout, and had to finish that particular workout until the game made me quit that one from exhaustion. Instead I had to save and exit, and reenter the game. There were other minor bugs, and they were minor, but it didn't help the irritation of the unbearable endgame.   Finally, even though I at times thought the plot was filled with levity and a bit fun, in retrospect, it just seems rushed. Like they threw all their fun half-baked ideas together and then forgot to turn on the oven. And then the finale, where   the man in black is just like 'hey im your dad, the end'  ,just ugh with a side of extra ugh. I was thinking of replaying the game with a different specialization, but not anymore. So this game has a whole lot of potential, even as a management game, but isn't all the way there.",
