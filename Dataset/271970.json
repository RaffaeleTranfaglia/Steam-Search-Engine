Ralph has been reduced to Level 1, and must rely on a cast of ladies straight out of the daydreams of the game's creator in order to succeed on his quest!",

            "review_text": "I have a Dissertation projects, courseworks and Engagement party that need to be sorted out in less than 3 weeks.  Spent 24 hours playing this game. Worth it. No regrets. My fiancee and my supervisors wont however.   On a serious note. This game is fun. The comedy and even some plot twists on the story are excellent. Provides good laugh and pretty interesting dialogues and names in the terms of the summoned girls and the characters in general.  You start as a pretty much useless character that cant level up. But depending on your dedication, Ralph, your character, have the potential to grow through non level related item boost.   Dungeons are usually short. 5 levels each. With a boss in the end (  well except 1 dungeon   ) and a 9999 floor dungeon.  There are more than 30 girls to summon and play with. Each with different personality and skills. They will be your main fighting force in the beginning through most part of the game, while Ralph would became the support member until he can hold on his own.  Graphic is pretty decent for an RPG maker game. Same thing cannot be said for Sounds, as in they are TERRIFIC. The battle theme songs are catchy and are well made into the game.    MINI SPOILERS (No worries you probably should read this)    The tiny island with 3 dungeons are just part 1 of the game. Medium spoiler would reveal how many parts there are now. As the game keeps getting updated    MEDIUM SPOILERS (Answer to question on Mini Spoiler)   There are 6 parts for now. Games would be updated as promised by the developers over time  ",

            "review_text": "This is a perfect example of not judging a...well, a game by its cover.  Hero and Daughter: not the best name. RPGMaker: a bad first impression. A bunch of pictures of...let's say fanservice-laden ladies as your cover picutres: not great.  But don't write this off! Hero and Daughter is a roguelikelike JRPG. There's an almost limitless amount of content. You build a team of extradimensional summons--for instance, a cyclops, a high-school overachiever, and a wrestler--and go off into random dungeons, building them and your town up to dizzying heights.  You don't level, but don't let that get you down. You eat a lot, and eventually grow into a functional level one here.  I dunno. The systems click together well. If you enjoy building a team out of miscellaneous parts, and also somewhat strategic JRPG combat, this is possibly the game for you!",

The hero starts starts at level 1,000,000... and everyone is afraid of him. that is untill he gets knocked down to level 1, and can't defeat even the weakest enemies. Now he has to recruit help to get his stats back up so he can defeat the Demon Lord. After which he can get his level back to where it was.   The range of allies you can 'Summon' is varied, and each girl has her own story.   A MUST play.",
