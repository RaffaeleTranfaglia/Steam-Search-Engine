            "review_text": "This game has changed my life. Before i got this game i was a weak beta who only managed to scrape through life by the skin of my teeth. I was 5'6 and weighed 300 pounds and had more grease in my hair than a McDonalds deep fryer. No girl would touch me, i was nothing. That all changed when Pajama Sam came into my life. His sheer determination to find all of his lost items inspired me to change my life. I forced my self to grow till i was 6,5, i then started to work out and got a body that causes women to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at the sight of me. Pajama Sam has made me a better person.   Pajama Sam is Love  Pajama Sam is Life   11/10  Would Bang.",
