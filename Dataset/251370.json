            "review_text": "I like to think of Escape Goat as 'the little game that could'. Launching first on the highly flawed and crowed Xbox Indie Game Market, it garnered a cult following that pushed it ahead of the seemingly endless shovelware that littered the platform, eventually making its way to Steam and even getting a sequel. Despite the acclaim, I've been sitting on the sidelines, still unconvinced by the unimpressive graphics and seemingly basic design. As is often the case though, my first impressions couldn't have been further from the truth, as Escape Goat more than lives up to its well deserved reputation.  Locked in a dungeon, you play as a magical goat with a magical mouse friend, on a journey to escape and bring with you the magical sheep who have been trapped for an eternity for crimes of witchcraft. To get to these sheep however you must first solve a series of puzzle rooms, the contents of which can be anything from harmless blocks to fire casting Reapers. Because of its nonlinear structure, there isn't any way for your abilities to grow overtime or otherwise have the game expand and evolve the further you get, but far from being a handicap the developer uses this potential limitation to craft remarkably consistent levels. There's no gradual rise in difficulty or sharp spikes later on, but instead a constant stream of challenging but not frustrating level designs that feel incredibly satisfying to complete.  You may only have less than a handful of moves and abilities, but the ways these can be applied to levels continues to broaden as different areas showcase various applications of them that never would have occurred to me to even try. It's this continual progression of what you think you can do without actually changing anything about your character that makes Escape Goat such a clever game to play. It rewards your own ingenuity without resorting to simply giving you a new mechanic to work with.   If you have yet to partake in the escape of Argus with your magical mouse friend, I'd advise you to delay no longer. Developer Magical Time Bean's Escape Goat is a truly impressive achievement and a joyous game to play, who's biggest flaw is it ends so soon (though perhaps it's for the best, as it completely negates the chance for filler). Despite its dated look it manages to feel fresh and innovative the whole way through, and you'd be fool to do as I did and wait so long to give it a chance.

            "review_text": "One of my favorite platformer games in ages and can't wait for more games from the developer. Its a super charming platformer that makes you think a lot about how to reach the exit. All levels are contained within one screen, but they mix up the mechanics often enough in the games ten different worlds to keep it interesting and challenging. I love the music in the game and while very simple the graphics suits the game very well. And who doesn't like a great pun as the name of the game?  Strongly recommended!   Pretty much all achievements in the game are for beating specific rooms in a specific way (such as limited moves or skipping some of the puzzle mechanics). It also has a speedrun achievement for beating the game in 45 minutes. And by beating the game it means that you need to beat  The final path  (the last world of the game) so you only need to beat enough to unlock that and then go straight for it and it allows you to use a separate savefile for it so you can practice the levels, jump over to your 'speedrun save' do that world and then switch back to your practice save and practice the next world.    Time to 100%:  ~7 hours",

            "review_text": "I first played Escape Goat on XBLI and instantly fell in love. It's a cute, but challenging puzzle platformer about a purple goat and a mouse with a sweet  pimp  magic hat who must escape from some jerk's diabolical prison. To do this, they must travel through nine different areas to rescue the magical, slumbering sheep within, and then conquer one final extra-long area for good measure.  Escape Goat has an interesting way about its levels. They're always shifting. Buttons and switches move blocks, barrels will roll, platforms move along tracks, and crates explode (usually in big chain reactions). Puzzles tend to involve trying to understand what will make what do what, and then making sure it all happens in the right order without getting yourself killed.  The actual movement can be a little floaty, but you quickly get used to it. It's not a game-ruiner. Block-wide openings require some precision to get through that may cause a few deaths when you're in a hurry or just unlucky with your dash timing. Still not a game-ruiner, but occasionally annoying.  There are enemies, but you can't kill them directly. You can often kill them indirectly, by using the environment creatively. In several spots, this can even gain you achievements. Which, by the way, aren't just your standard 'congrats you beat another level!' fare. The majority of the achievements here are for completing levels in challenging ways. Many of these require you to do things that were clearly not intended when the game was originally released on XBLI, but which probably came to the dev's attention later on down the line. Barring a handful of annoying chievos, these add a good deal to the game, requiring you to think outside the box and push your skills to the limit.  On that note, the overall difficulty of the game is pretty good. You've got a few easy warm-up levels, and then quickly get into the thick of it. Towards the end, you'll be putting your platforming skills to the test. If it's still not tough enough for you, don't fret. Once you complete the game, a bonus mode unlocks with four worlds of extra-challenging levels. A warning pops up to tell you that the going's going to get tough when you start it. And it's not kidding. I'm sure not finishing that without a walkthrough anytime soon.  The game looks great! The dev understands the importance of color, something which pleases me greatly. There's a bit in the first Castlevania episode of Sequelitis about using colors that pop, and it's a lesson that I feel doesn't get taken to heart often enough. In Escape Goat, your goat is purple. Your mouse friend is orange. The environments use a variety of colors to keep your eyes focused. No slog through brownish grey ruins, here. I mean, there... there are some browns and greys. But you get what I'm saying.  Maybe it's just me, but I think the music here shines above all else. Which is only natural, as the dev was originally a video game composer before getting into design, as well. There's a unique sound to the music of Escape Goat that I really can't describe very well. They should have sent a musician. I don't know if it's an echoey sound or, I dunno. Reverb? Something. Makes for some mysterious melodies, though, I can tell you that. Give it a listen on  Bandcamp  [magicaltimebean.bandcamp.com] , if you like. If that sounds like something you'd like to hear in a game, then this is that game, and you know where the purchase button is!   The game contains a level creator, and you can play player-made levels by placing them into a certain folder on your computer. There's a stickied thread on EG's Discussions board that will tell you more.  It's pretty short at about 3 hours for the initial campaign, with potential time extensions in the forms of the bonus campaign and player-made levels. It's also pretty cheap at only $5, which seems like a pretty good trade off. I can safely recommend the game at that price. If you're on the fence, $1.24 during a sale is honestly about as much of a steal as a steal can be. If you're dissatisfied at that price (you won't be), then I just don't know what you're doing with your life.",

Otherwise, the platforming is solid and the visual style is simple and fairly easy to recognize the parts after you have seen them once. As with Super Meat Boy, I enjoy the single-room challenges that are fairly compact and let you get back to the action quickly, and it offers a variety of routes in case you get stuck on one area (this did not happen on the first mission).  The first mission was fairly easy - the second, so far - painfully hard. There are some annoying frustrations in it that I could do without. while most are more thoughtful, there is one that required some painful split second pixel-perfect moves, and it feels out of place. At least it is the first thing you do in that level, and so once you get past it the rest is less obnoxious.  Last thing I want to say. The story is weird because it would be perfect if they had just said 'You are a goat - escape and rescue some sheep', but it decides that it wants to try and throw some ambiguity into it that either needed to be expanded more or forgotten. I clearly put far too much effort into thinking about this as you can safely ignore it and miss nothing, but because it is there I have to say something.",

            "review_text": "Sometimes all you need is a name. You come up with a clever pun - 'Hmmm... Scapegoat... scape... escape... Escape Goat!' - and everything just flows from there. It's risky to force inspiration by trying to design a game around a cute title, but in this case the result is surprisingly fun.   Escape Goat is exactly what it says on the tin. You control a goat, and you have to solve puzzles to escape rooms. The puzzles are of the 'touch this switch to open the wall to grab the key' variety. The retro graphical style reminds me of some early arcade games, and fits well with the gameplay. I'm not a huge fan of the current trend of making everything look 8-bit, but it feels appropriate for this game.   There's not a lot of depth to be found here. Your goat can move, jump, double jump, and ram things. Early on you befriend a mouse who can climb walls and (on some levels) switch places with you. Each room is a single non-scrolling screen, with switches placed here and there. Sometimes there is a correct order you need to press the switches, in order to open the right wall to give you access to the next switch. Sometimes you'll need your mouse companion to hold down one switch while you jump over to the next one, or you'll have to send the mouse through small openings to trigger switches you can't reach. On some levels you face fire-throwing wizards, deadly traps, and other obstacles. These hinderances can be exploited in your favor; for example, a well-dodged fireball can destroy a crate that was blocking your way.    The level design is great. As a casual gamer I found the difficulty level to be just about right, though some of the levels took more than a few tries to figure out. You usually have a choice of levels to play, so if you get stuck, you can always try a different set of levels for a while. The game was designed to work best with a controller, but I used a keyboard and had no trouble.  Bottom line: Escape Goat is not very involving, or very pretty, but it's a fun time-waster.",

Fortunately 2 minutes into playing I found myself drawn into an extremely slick 2d puzzle platformer with a great soundtrack. The basic mechanic of jumping around and hitting some switches is complimented by a little mouse friend to help extend your 'reach' a bit.  Levels start out quite forving as they teach you the basic game mechanics and interactions with the mouse, but by the half way point start turning wuite fiendish and can require many, many, *many* attempts to get past. By the end thye are sort of straddling that luck vs skill vs figuring out three way fight and sometimes you'll know what needs to be done, but it will take you dozens of lives before you manage to just slip between two death dealing traps in exactly the right way to continue.  On that note, one *warning* for people with more advanced gaming hardware. It turns out that the timing of the game is not based on clocks/counters but rather on the frame pacing of the games draw engine. For most people with 60hz displays, that won't matter much (though you can get a slight 'slowdown' if you set things to a 50hz euro sync rate instead). Those of us with 144hz gaming panels though are in for a bit of a rough ride.   I hit a certain level where i was just physically incapable of timing jumps fast enough to 'work' and thought I must have the wrong idea of what the level needed, so I looked up a youtube walkthrough. Well wouldn't you know it, everything seemed to be moving way *way* slower for that guy, and he was speaking german... I put two and two together, rebooted the game with the display at 50hz not 144hz, and suddnly everything was literally moving 3x slower and those 'impossible' jump timings suddenly became quite easy.   (and to think i beat the first half of the game at 3x 144hz 'speed')  That resolved though I really did enjoy the game and would happily reccomend it to anyone who loves neo retro indie stuff with great soundtracks and great action puzzle platformer game play.",

A relatively short game, you play as a goat that was imprisoned for witchcraft. Other inmates include sheep that are locked in various rooms. Each section of rooms has a unique theme to the puzzles.  Add to that, you have a little mouse companion that comes in handy, in a single-player co-op kinda way.  And once you beat the game, you get a second set of more challenging levels. The 'All Intensive Purposes' rooms.",

Probably one of the most no brainer buys for anyone into puzzle platformers, right up there with the portal games. Tight controls and clever level design. It has challenge levels once you complete the main game, as well as a level editor, it's a great value.",
