The gripping story, attention to detail and the realistic graphics make the game a immersive rpg FPS, undertale simulator and/or pig farm sim In this game, our main character, SPOOPY, fights his inner urges to become a vegan as he is haunted by the pigs of his past. He now battles these specter pigs not because they attempt to kill him but because meat is ♥♥♥♥ing delicious and being a vegan doesn't let him do dat. He must become one with his pig self. He must accept that he is a farmer who hates being shot in the balls and having a torch blinding him. Wait no, that's just a part of the game. Also they're on a farm or something i don't really know   On a whole  10/10 - like skyrim with pigs -IGN",

            "review_text": "Alright, I generally dont review things before I've finished the game or decided not to, but I dont see how this will be any different after more time spent playing beyond new and likely awesome weapons and enemies, so unless I need to revise this later, I will just say that this is probably one of the best less than a buck games on Steam. It's completely basic, pick up and play, fast paced shooter goodness with a lite story to keep you moving forward. Mostly though, it's all about pig carnage....pigs, demonic pigs, undead pigs, tiny fast little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ pigs, gargantuan ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off boss pigs, etc....  As you progress through to new days, new weapons will unlock, and there is also a meat grinder, which when filled with pig body parts and shot in the right spot, will churn out ammo and disposable weapons during battles. The grinder also sees upgrades as you progress. There is also an electric fence that can make short work of your enemies who are standing near it.  You are encouraged, berated, and generally bossed around by the farmer, who is impaled on a wall in the barn with a missing leg that was clearly torn off, as there is bone sticking out, lol. He is pretty funny and also can be a total ♥♥♥♥, but sometimes it's your own fault (since you will inevitably feel the urge to shoot him, shine your flashlight in his face, and otherwise mess with him). Basically, he represents the start of a new level (day) before and after each battle.  There is also in battle healing, via water pumps located around the farm. I've also gotten a carton of milk which allows you to jump super high.  ....and that is basically it. Lots of pig blood and bullets.  You should probably buy this.",

            "review_text": "Blood and Bacon is a indie game that is unique to say the least. It may not be the most AAA title from popular developers, but that does not make this game just as good. Not only did this game meet my standards but also exceeded. This game when above and beyond the Call of Duty (which this game is nothing like).   Story- well to say the least of the story, there is one that i haven't exactly found out. This games story makes you really dig deep into the game, as they did not just do cut scenes and put the story out in the open. I personally like this approach to the game, as this makes the game more deep then you would think on first hand when playing the game.  Game play-The single player was fun to play through without cheats, although cheats are a totally viable option (if you want every day to be revenge day). I couldn't test the multi player as i didn't have any friends who play this game. However- they put in a whole alpha phase to the multi player (meaning it is currently being tested) and they put in a harder game mode for the multi player if you want to, along with server commands. If you have friends, play it with them, it will only make the game more enjoyable. Single player is just as fun however, so either way you can not go wrong. The weapons in the game are just as good as you would expect them to be in other shooters. They are balanced, fun and easy to use, and not one gun is better then the other, so its all based on how you want to play. Although the number of guns you get are small, this is a good thing, so you are not over whelmed with what to pick and choose. Hit boxes are up to standards with other games. This game also has gore to it, as the title suggests, meaning body parts go flying if the enemy is shot the right way. You can also kick them and complete an achievement with them.   Sound-The sound in this game is very well made. This isn't a shooter that is supposed to be realistic, so don't go judging the game on that end. Instead, judge it on how clear the sound is. The sound is very clear to say the least. There is also no sound delay, so you wont feel like the sound is lagging (this can be very frustrating)  Graphics-Although the graphics are not like Destiny or Fall Out 4 on the PC, this game is not supposed to be like that. The graphics were made to please the eye, while also being not so strong that you cant play it on non gaming or old PCs, or even a laptop. I got 60 Frames Per Second (FPS) while played this game every time I did. I never Experienced any lag except if I had a browser open while playing, but this is because my laptop is not the most graphically enhanced. This game is about the experience, and not the power about it (even an achievement for turning up the 'graphics' lol).  Over all rating-If you like shooter games, this does not fall below even the most modern shooters. This game visually gives me a vibe of Retro games like Left 4 Dead, while still giving me a sensation that describes the most modern games.  This game could have easily been priced up to 30 dollars for how good it is, but the developers decided to put the game to just a dollar, to make a profit off of the game but still be affordable so everyone could play the game.   Rating 10/10. Recommended for people who like: Shooters, arcade games, multi player games, and value games.",

            "review_text": "Strangely enough, this was a really fun game. The first hour and a half of playing this was really enjoyable, but then decided to see if I was able to beat the game in one sitting.  I played this with my friend on co-op mode so the Days went by a bit easier than what I would think trying to beat all 100 days playing solo. For the past six hours (and only six hours as I will never touch this game again), we went through what was the most grindful game I've completed.   I have unlocked all the achievements in the amount I have played. The only hard one to get is probably the FrankenBoar's Monsters achievement. I would say do this one on the first day as that would be the easiest way to get it. All the other achievements are pretty self explainatory and can be easily acquired throughout playing the game.   Through the first 30 days, you can see what the rest of the 70 days will consist of, as the game tends to repeat the same monsters and pigs again and again. It reminds of a simple hack-n-slash game with repeating enemies, so this didn't bother me as much as it would to someone else. Day 100 is the most fufilling day to complete. The final level contains   all the bosses together with Princess being the biggest, fattest pig ever out of the whole game and with all 3 of the giant boars at the same time.   Not only was this the most hardest and intense level in the entire game, it was the best way to end the game. As earlier, I would highly recommend playing with someone else on this game, especially if you are planning to get all the achievements.  There is one easter egg that caught my attention which was   when you are inside the barn, there is an attic part of the building above with a sunshine painting on the very far end of the wall. When shot at, the farmer sings the chorus of 'Stressed Out' by twenty one pilots. Since I'm a huge fan of the band, this really put a smile on my face.    Overall 7.7/10",

            "review_text": "time for my review of this game, oh boy  this game is a very entertaining mess, what i mean by that i will explain. this game in my overall oppinion is not really too good, but it can be very fun to play for a few hours, if you pick up this game dont let it gather dust due to negative reviews, the reason being that there is actually fun to be had in this game, the graphics are bad as hell ill admit but there is no reason to hate a game due to graphic and visual stuff, well unless it's really bad.  this game has a focus on gameplay, i know your probably laughing at that but I'm going to break down what this game is in my review for this game.  well the positives are:  the enemies, hear me out they are pigs, but its great to get away from the zombie games and have something else take the spotlight for once as a mutated mess, and pigs are a suprisingly fun idea, you can run around shooting them like regular zombies exept they generally take alot more hits than in zombie games, the reason being beyond me but its still fun  the weapon selection aint that great, but is still pretty good compaired to some other games, you have these weapons to use: -Colt 1911 -357 Magnum -paintgun (yup for real) -silences XDM (correct me if im wrong about that one) -shotgun -M4A1 -AK47 -UZI -P90 -and a strange nuke device as far as im aware thats all the guns that are available to use in the game.  their is an item system to this game, and a way to purchase items during a level using pigs meat, believe it or not this is done using a grinder, of which somehow turns it into ammo and items to purchache using the ammount of meat present in the machine, this mechanic is something you dont get often, not unique but still something good to see  you can play with 2 players, and up to 4 (or 6 in the halloween update) but when this was posted this feature is still in beta, alough from my testing it so far works pretty well, i love playing with friends in this game, and when its not with friends, their is suprisingly good community with the others who you can get into games with.  the gameplay is often smooth, this game does not require a lot of processes and actually very little, meaning on even a craptop this game can reach a constant 60FPS, or more.  as their is positives their is also negatives:  their is only a single map to play on, it may be a pretty good map but it is small, and rather repetitive and dull after a while, a good map variety or progression of maps would be cool to have, but their just isnt that.  their are only 2 bosses present in the game, which you face every 10 days, the time to face them isnt bad but the variety is poor, you would expect their to be different, more cretive bosses every 10 days but it just goes back and fourth between 2, known as princess and the brother or brothers after the first 10 days, a better variety would be apriciated in a game like this.  their isnt much dialogue, only the farmer really talks, and he says some ridiculouse jokes, i just think maybe their could be some lines for your characters to say, i wont push this as a very negative just something that i think could make a improovment  their is no story to this game to my knowledge, a good story is always cool even for a survival game, where you can come across things that tell you about the past of the events in this game, but currently their is none, only what happens from day 1, again just a feature that would make the game better not something that ruines the game entirely  in conclusion i think this game is pretty fun, definatly good value for the current selling price, this is why i will give this game a definate up rating, even if it isnt fun forever its still a good laugh for up to 5 hours! if you enjoy it longer than that then thats great!  7/10",

The game's steep price may cause some gamer-gators to stray away from the game, but trust me, it is WORTH every single penny. The first thing I love about this game is it's unique art style. You look at most popular, mainstream first-person shooters and you get the same, boring, mundane, and downright smelly bullcrap. Well, this is not the case with Blood and Bacon. It's unique setting of some kind of rural area makes for an amazing experience. It is like I'm ACTUALLY THERE, and that is not something I can say for 'brown gun warfare'. Another aspect I love in the game is the quirkiness, and the sense of a deeper lore. The game has such a ♥♥♥♥ing AMAZING sense of humor. The farmer is very likeable, and I give my infinite praise to whoever the voice actor. I won't spoil anything, but if you find some really well hidden easter eggs, you're going to be scratching your head trying to figure out the developer's clues and secrets. The soundtrack to this game is groundbreaking. Yes, it's a bit primitive, but that's what I love about it. It KNOWS what it wants to be, and isn't some awful, confused instrumental! Sure, you may have heard it somewhere, but if it ain't broke, don't fix it! The weapons are so well balanced, and the pigs are challenging, yet fair. (Unlike Left 4 Dead 2, Valve's very awful spiritual predeccesor.) I give Blood and Bacon a perfect 10 / 10.",

Only real problem I have with the game is that basically every single 10-day boss (Day 10, 30, 50, etc) can jump onto a roof and regen health, and you can't do anything to stop them from doing so (as far as I know).  As for new content ideas: -A horde mode of sorts (like, there's a day where the pig count is literally in the thousands). -Possibly some secret days (if you kill all the pigs but one, then proceed to lead the special pig to a certain spot, a door would open up that leads you to some special day where all the pigs are buffed to the max or something of the sort). -More weapons (possibly Sci-Fi themed like a laser gun). -Friendly minion pigs (fulfill a certain task to convert a pig to your side to fight against the bad pigs). -Silly Music (something crazy stupid like a banjo solo / something hillbilly sounding).",

So he and his wife noscoped King Duncan (actually it was Macskrub who did the super stealth tomahawk throw across the map. Then, became part of Faze and Optic. However, Optic found out that he was in the iluminati so they quicksckoped him out of the clan, infact Macbeth was being such a skrub that they even went to his internet shop with MLG merchandise such as mountain dew shirts, and Macskrub shirts. They hacked his website, and they killed Macskrub by 1337 haxing the computer and then it exploded which was a wonderful sight with many lens flairs, once he was killed, snipars smiled upon down from noscoper heaven, and the world order was brought back to normal. While macskrub was sent to hardscoper hell, and he was hardscoped by hardscopers for eternity.  Moral of the story: Don't be a skrub ( ° ʖ °)",

The game is fantastic good fun for the first 50 levels whilst you unlock things, find easter eggs. and kill piggys! It's at that point when all of that ends, the Rocket ammo glitches and you kill the same fat boss for the 4th time that you realize how taxing at repetitive the game is. Seriously.... This game would be much more fun if it ended at level 51. 61-100 are probably the only real downside to this game, so be prepared to use 'skip day' cheats to hope to bosses (or past) around level 50.  If you buy this game knowing that's going to be an issue? Best dollar you've ever spent! If you buy it and 'run into the wall'? It's still $1 well spent for 50 levels of fun.

It's not funny, it doesn't play well, it looks awful and isn't even worth the measly price they are asking for.  If you find Goat Simulator to be the epitome of hilarity, go right ahead, but if you have so much as a shred of taste in your being, steer clear.  Edit: After a nice chat with one of the developers, I can tell that they have their heart in the right place. Blood and Bacon was not my cup of tea, but it is refreshing to see an indie developer care about the game and the players as much as Big Corporation does.  Every developer could learn a little something from Big Corporation, by putting the player first, and actually taking their time to listen.",

            "review_text": " Reviewing in English, portuguese and spanish!    English (Sorry, my english is not good):  What caught my attention at this game was the price. I watched some videos and thought, it's not too bad for such a cheap game. I spend so much money on beer, to have a few hours of pleasure, and sometimes i go out to drink, thinking of picking/meet up a female to have sex, but in the most cases, i end the night drunk, alone with less money and no sex. What is 99 cents, compared to my lonely existence and nights just drowning myself in beer, hoping to find the woman of my life at a bar. So I decided to buy the game. To my surprise, I could not play. A problem on my computer did not let me run the game. I joined the forum to ask for help, and at the same day, the creator of the game added me as a friend on steam. He gave me full attention, A very patient and dedicated guy. And after many attempts, we finally figured out what my problem was. My only solution was to format my computer, but I could not do it, because I have many jobs and programs that I can not do. The creator of the game had the brilliant idea of ​​doing a new update so that I could also play. He made myself very happy. His dedication made me open a can of beer, put the bacon to fry and spend all night playing non-stop! I've never had so much fun with such a simple game! Every discovery, every Easter egg made me die of laughter. I know the game is not perfect, and after a few days it will be somewhat repetitive. However, I can tell you that the creator is a very dedicated guy and will release new versions. Playing this game is like going drinking with friends on Fridays. Same friends, same beers, same places, but you have fun, because is with your friends.   Portugues:  O que me chamou atenção neste jogo foi o preço. Olhei uns vídeos e pensei, não está tão mal para um jogo tão barato. Gasto tanto dinheiro com cerveza, para ter algumas horas de prazer e muitas vezes saio pra beber pensando em conseguir uma fêmea para copular e acabo a noite bêbado, sozinho com menos dinheiro e sem transar. O que são 99 centavos, comparados com noites sozinho afogando minha existência na cerveja, com a esperança de conhecer a mulher da minha vida na mesa de um bar. Assim que decidi comprar o jogo. Para minha sorpresa, não pude jogar. Um problema no meu computador não me deixava executar o jogo. Entrei no fórum para pedir ajuda e no mesmo dia, o mesmo criador do jogo me adicionou como amigo no steam. Me deu total atenção, foi paciente e dedicado. E depois de muitas tentativas, finalmente descobrimos qual era o meu problema. Minha única solução era formatar o meu computador, porém eu não podia fazer, já que tenho muitos trabalhos e programas que me impossibilitam de fazer. O criador do jogo teve a brilhante ideia, de fazer uma nova atualização para que eu também pudesse jogar. Ele me fez muito feliz. Sua dedicação me fez abrir uma lata de cerveja, colocar bacon pra fritar e passar toda a noite jogando sem parar! Nunca me diverti tanto com um jogo tão simples! Cada descobrimento, cada easter egg me fazia morrer de rir. Sei que o jogo não é perfeito, e passando alguns dias, será algo repetitivo. Porém, te posso dizer que o seu criador é um cara muito dedicado e estará lançando novas atualizações. Jogar esse jogo é como ir beber com os amigos nas sextas feiras. São os mesmos amigos, mesmas cervejas, mesmos lugares, porém, você se diverte, se é com amigos.    Español:  Lo que llamó mi atención en este juego fue el precio. Vi algunos videos y pensé, no esta tan mal para un juego tan barato. Me gasto tanta pasta en cerveza, para tener unas cuantas horas de placer y, a menudo salgo a beber pensando en conseguir/conocer a una hembra para echar un polvo, pero mi noche acaba en borrachera, solo, con menos dinero y sin mojar. ¿Que son 99 centimos, comparados con mis noches a solas, ahogando mi existencia en la cerveza, con la esperanza de encontrar la mujer de mi vida en una mesa de bar. Así que decidí comprar el juego. Para mi sorpresa, no podía jugar. Un problema en mi pc no me dejó jugarlo. Me uní al foro para pedir ayuda y, en el mismo día, el mismo creador del juego me agrego como amigo en steam. Me dio toda atención posible, era paciente y dedicado. Y después de muchos intentos, finalmente descubrimos cual era mi problema. Mi única solución era formatear mi pc, pero no podía hacerlo, porque tengo muchos trabajos y programas y no me puedo permitir tener que volver a instalar y arreglar todo ahora. El creador del juego tuvo la brillante idea de hacer una nueva actualización, así yo también podria jugar. Me ha hecho muy feliz. Su dedicación me hizo abrir una lata de cerveza, poner bacon a freír y pasar toda la noche jugando sin parar! Nunca me he divertido tanto con un juego tan sencillo! Cada descubrimiento, cada easter egg me hizo morirse de la risa. Sé que el juego no es perfecto, y después de unos días será algo repetitivo. Sin embargo, puedo decir que su creador es un tio muy dedicado y sacará nuevas actualizaciones. Jugar este juego es como ir de copas con los amigos los viernes por la noche. Son los mismos amigos, la misma cerveza, mismos lugares, pero te diviertes igual, ya que estas con tus amigos.",

(Day 40 boss *wink wink*)  i mean it's as much as idk anything for 1$ and also runs on a playstation 2 so i guess you should get it",
