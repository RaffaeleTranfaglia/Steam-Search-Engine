It doesn't have an overhead map, but it adds a lot to JA's combat. Also it's way more silly. You can blow a hole through a wall with a machinegun.  This game is like JA's goofy nephew.",

            "review_text": "For any of you that remember the boardgame 'Ambush!' (by Victory Games) or the PC title 'Soldiers at War' (by SSI), this game will probably seem familiar to you. It's a full 3D, turn-based, World War II tactical combat game where you control individual members of your squad in special ops missions.  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  Pros:  * The AI (while not fantastic) is pretty good - or at least seems pretty good - definitely going to give you a better run for your money than most games * Everything is destructible – walls, doors, chests, windows, and even trees and floors! It's a game like no other * It's very addicting. I have over 200 hours playing it and have still not come close to being bored with ANY part of the game yet * Game physics are amazing - easily beats out some triple-A games with how well they're implemented - nothing beats killing an enemy a level above you by blowing up the floor below him * The array of weapons and ammunition types are awesome (most completely accurate, given the genre) * The music is not bad... it'll either get on your nerves or grow on you - or both ;)  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  Cons: (in paragraph form with explanations)  Most complain about the dated graphics, but while I love the jazzy newer games like Diablo III, I found the visuals in Silent Storm (or S2) to be quite functional... even sort of impressive.  The voice acting sucks, but the cheesy quips the soldiers (both friendly and enemy) say are so funny, you wind up almost liking it better that way.  The missions are all based on this clandestine what-if slant on World War II (such as fully uniformed Germans operating with near impunity all throghout Britain, or Axis commandos striking targets they never even dreamed of having access to in real life). This (IMHO) is really no issue – just simply pretend everything is happening somewhere in occupied France or something.  A really odd game decision made by the developers was to include (later in the game) such things as laser guns, PanzerKlien (near-impenetrable armor that makes soldiers look like space robots), and modern-day-esque weapons. This has game-altering impact and is the source of many complaints regarding gameplay. There is however an easily found and installed mod that removes all this wacky stuff from the game entirely (replacing it with better equipped enemy soldiers... which works).  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  All and all, I love this game and HIGHLY reccomend it to anyone who likes turn-based games and World War II tactical combat. Hell, even people who play games like Jagged Alliance, X-Com or Fallout-Tactics will likely enjoy this as well.",

            "review_text": "A solid squad level, turn-based tactics game. This type of game seems to be missing in recent years. Released in the early 2000s; you control a 6-man squad from the top down in a WW2 setting. The weapons are concurrent to the setting, complete with corresponding range, accuracy and power; EXCEPT for the bits of science fiction thrown in...I'll just leave it at that. The environments are descructible with beautiful physics. Depending on the weapon, you can shoot through walls, ceiling, or floor...if you're sure of the target on the other side. If you were a fan of JA, the original XCom, or even SWAT 2 (remember that one?), you can't go wrong with this. It's a classic that might even beat those examples given. I only wish i'd discovered this when it came out. In fact, it made me go out and get a copy of Fallout: Tactics, for my library. This came on Steam through Greenlight; while lots of trash comes out of that program, diamonds like this exists.     If you want more specific detail: There are 6 'classes' to choose from, and each class have their own special skill tree, although I've noticed they pretty much overlap with each other. Each character has a class, attribute (strength, intelligence, dexterity) and 'secondary attribute' (throwing, melee, sniping etc.) For example: a Sniper class character is likely going to be good at 'Sniping'...but that doesn't mean you can't get your Medic to get up to speed at 'Sniping' as well. Classes are as follows: Scout, Sniper, Medic, Grenadier, Soldier and Engineer. There's also a 'weapons familiarity' modifier each char has with various weapons...as you can see, there's lots of customization that can go into this game.",

Collapse a building to take out a sniper. There are endless random missions you can accept, simply by walking into enemy icons on the map. Depends on which region you are in, and what part of that region you go into, you will play on a that encounter map. However, the map still randomizes, including buildings and vehicle placement, and the number, type, and armaments of enemies on the map.  Both Axis and Ally campaigns are both great plays. And while you can loot any weapon you see an enemy using, it depends on which side you picked if your base will resupply you in that ammo type. Otherwise, keep hording that enemy ammo. Great game. Tons of replayability. And it's cheap as hell. Pick it up.",

Fully destructable environment; the physics are delightful and worthy of playtime just as a demolitions sandbox.

There are several classes of soldiers each with their own strengths and you command a squad of them to accomplish missions that involve killing nazis. There are weapon options from firearms, explosives, RPGs, grenades and melee. Each class will tend to be better with certain kinds depending on what you select to upgrade as soldiers gain levels.  The downside, WWII era powersuits. How the developers turned what should be a high point into a low one is an accomplishment. Near the end you will have to use them, and they are just not as fun as having the soldiers on foot.  After finishing the game I had my fill, barely touching the expansion that is included.",

I remember SS generating some hype back when it came out but after playing for a few hours I decided that looking at two soldiers standing in front of each other and shooting back and forth because they are both apparently blind is a waste of my time. Turns take for ever due to horrible AI on both sides and the fact that most soldiers are crosseyed and cant hit anything.
