It's weird to look at, weird to play and so probably not for everyone but I love it - it's has a great balance of creepy and mysterious and it's quite original in places too.  Puzzles are tricky sometimes but there are no red herrings (tho I've no idea about the bench in Chapter 3!) and everything you need is reasonably easy to find if you look in the right places. There are oo tiny changes in the cursor or 2-pixel-wide items - movement is quick - no convoluted dialogues to dig through - you mostly just play the game instead of walking, talking and so on.  Update: since writing that I've tried Chapter 4 and - unfortunately - I keep running into a crash bug which leaves me unable to continue. This isn't ideal but hopefully the developer will address it/I'll figure out a different way around the problem - and the puzzles do seem a LOT harder in this episode too! :(",

            "review_text": "This game has been in development for about 5 years now, so far 5 out of the planned 6 chapters have been finished. The reason it has taken so long is that the entire game is being built -by hand- with real materials like cardboard, clay and wood. It is absolutely beautiful, as you can probably imagine. Not only that, but the story AND the writing are both terrific! I'd say that almost all the puzzles hold some sense of logic to them, but as this is a game about entering people's dreams, it somewhat fittingly DOES start to lose some of it's sanity with it's puzzles (as is the case with all adventure games unfortunately). I had to use a walkthrough a few times to complete it, but that's the case with pretty much any adventure game I've ever played...  I absolutely recommend playing this! It's not finished yet, and based on how long it's taken to get the first 5 chapters out, it seems like we'll be waiting a while yet for the ending, but it's a wait very much worth enduring!",

I've just recently gotten into point-and-clicks and I think this just set a high standard and it's going to be hard to find a game that beats it. The wait for Chapter 6 is going to be painful, especially because the devs post teasers on their  Twitter . As an artist, this is a game to appreciate, and as someone who enjoys 'darker' art, it's a smorgasbord.   Reasons why you need it:  + Devs are very responsive to cries for help with glitches + Art style is incredible and obviously takes a lot of work + Puzzles are really tough + Puzzles are innovative and different + Chapter format makes it easier to appreciate in moderation instead of doing a binge + It's easy to binge  There are some little glitches here and there, but your love for the game will overpower them. Community for this game is great as well. There are no cons, really. Although, I would love to see some dynamic backgrounds.",

            "review_text": "I have over 600 games in my Steam account, and the vast majority of them are still unplayed. So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game.   One Hour Reviews #50 - The Dream Machine  Before I started my series of reviews, I hadn't really played much in the way of adventure games. But, it's been nice seeing a resurgence in this genre, and now I've had the opportunity to play through several adventure games.  Going in, I didn't know anything about The Dream Machine. So playing it felt a little like going to a movie that you didn't see the trailer for, and you don't even know what genre of movie it is. And I'm glad I did that because I feel like I've just watched the opening act of a mystery, so not knowing anything ahead of time definitely added to that sense of mystery.  I won't spoil anything about the story, other than to say I enjoyed the first chapter, which I just had time to finish in my first hour of play. The story kept me engaged enough that by the time I noticed the time my playthough was nearly over. I think this is one of the better compliments you can give a game when it has that ability to suck you in.  The actual gameplay itself seems fairly typical for a point and click adventure game. It involves a lot of walking around, doing some pixel hunting to find points of interest, and picking up things that you'll need to use later. Pretty much everything I could pick up I ended up using on something, and often in ways I would not have expected. Besides the 'use this item on this thing' type of puzzle, I also played a different kind of puzzle that involved turning knobs on a machine.  I did occasionally have some trouble lining up my mouse cursor on the right pixel to pick something up, but it didn't happen often enough to be really annoying. Also, when you move the mouse to the top of the screen, a bar will pop down with your inventory, but sometimes this interferes with you trying to point to something at the top of the screen. Other than these couple of minor annoyances, I didn't really run into any problems with the game.  Besides the story, I also enjoyed the art style. Most of the adventure games I've played have an animated, cartoon like art style. But this game has a claymation inspired art style which really sets it apart. I can really tell a lot of work went into the art for this game. The characters look great, and so do the backgrounds. Everything has this hand crafted look to it.  I'm not sure if the following chapters are any longer to play, but I could see some potential concern about the game being relatively short (for what you pay for it). There are 6 chapters total (but the 6th is not out yet). I wouldn't be surprised if the follow on chapters take a little longer than an hour to get through. For me personally it's not an issue, as I think the game is worth the price, and would happily recommend it.",

There are a few minor glitches and errors that will crash the game, so remember to save often.  Other than that, looking forward to the rest of the chapters.

Not being a huge fan of 'point and click' games I decided to give 'Dream Machine' and chance one rainy afternoon when I was bored with the usual third or first person shooters, and was pleasantly surprised with my discovery. For starters, the artistic direction that was chosen for this game suits the tone of the story perfectly and does nothing but add to the overall creepiness factor of the characters and the setting. The game is also pretty challenging at times and really makes you think. I almost felt like a detective while playing. I also found it refreshing that the game was broken up into several different chapters, each entirely different than the one that preceded it. Overall, the stories here are pretty interesting for a few hours, and for five dollars I can recommend 'Dream Machine' to those who are at this page right now, interested in this game, considering a new addition to their Steam catalog.",

And I'd be lying if I said I didn't get a kick out of the subtle  The Prisoner  shoutout in Chapter 1.  I am, however, struck by how lucid the various dreamers are once you find them, not to mention weirdly capable of taking the whole bizzare scenario in stride. Then again, considering the sorts of things I'm able to take in stride in my own dreams that would weird the hell out of me in real life, I suppose they aren't quite so lucid after all. But this is neither the time nor place for those stories.  My only complaints are that A) a few of the puzzles are terribly inconveniant to complete, even after you've figured out the solution, you're given a hell of a runaround to actually put that solution into action. And B) the chapters are over too quickly. I hope the next two chapters are longer.",

With an amazingly rich story that takes you into the horrors and fantasies of the subconscious dream space along with some of the most challenging and well thought out puzzles I've seen this is a must play experience. If it isn't the soulful soundtrack that gets you it's the stop motion animation and how well it's been translated into a point and click game.

There are plenty of puzzles to solve and I was able to finally work them out without needing any help apart from the last code at the end! The graphics are great and I haven't found any bugs. It will keep you engaged for hours.",

The story seems to be interesting so far. The puzzles are on the light side, and the game's first two chapters seemed to be very short, I finished them in about 2 hours. On the plus side, I haven't encountered a single bug in the first two chapters, so those seem to have been fixed. Still, can't really recommend it - mainly because the game is so short for the asking price.",

Unfortunately, It's held back by countless of bugs, crashes, performance issues and inconsistencies.  That, coupled with the fact that the full game hasn't been released yet (At the time of writing, chapter 6 is not done) makes you feel like you're playing a early access game.  The story is great, the puzzles are challenging but not frustratingly illogical and the artstyle has a lot of heart. But its techinal issues prevents me from recommending this game.",
