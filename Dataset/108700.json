Not the same mechanics, gameplay only average, background away.  In fact, this game took all the good stuff of the original Death Rally, throw it away, then shot at it like it was clay pigeon shooting. Replace the void they made by average stuff they had in stock. Then sell it under Death Rally name.  And, in this final game version : repetitive, way too easy, lack of creativity, average gameplay, lack of fun.  Don't, just, don't.",

            "review_text": "Haven't played the original Death Rally, but the remake is a good game in its own right. Short, fast paced races, 3 car add-ons, 6 upgradeable weapons, 7 maps, and 8 cars. All in all, a decent bag of fun.  Sure enough, it's not a triple-A title, and nowhere near as complex, but it can be fun. The short races mean you can play a race or two whenever you have a minute and get back to whatever you were doing. Gets even more fun with a few buddies in online[1] play.   Gameplay in Death Rally doesn't offer anything brand new, but gets the basics right. Controlling the car is simple, either via a single stick or wasd, and there doesn't seem to be any problems with responsiveness[2]. Steering does take a bit of getting used to, but in the end is not much different from other console-like top-down racers - after a few races it should feel natural. Main gun auto-fires at any targets dead ahead and within range, and secondary guns/mines/nitro are activated by pressing the corresponding buttons.  The visuals in Death Rally are quite pleasing to the eye. Race tracks and cars look good and offer a lot of detail. The garage view (main menu) shows a nicely-rendered model of the curently selected car (with any selected add-ons/weapons visible) and the UI is clean and efficient. All the necessary elements are visible on one screen and laid out without making the screen cluttered and messy. The UI is designed to be controller-friendly (looks tablet-friendly too) so race selection and car upgrades are quick and easy.   AI opponents do offer a fair challenge, but that's mostly beacuse they tend to drive slightly better cars. The regular mob racers have decent 'driving skills' and their cars are slighlty better upgraded, but only up to what's achievable by players. 'Boss' racers (of which there is up to one per race), on the other hand, tend to drive real well and their cars are often better than anything the player can achieve. While this does make the game more challenging early on it just breaks it in the very late-game -- most bosses will just speed away right from the start, and only generous amounts of nitro (in-race pickups, random chance) can help catch up. The worst example of this is the 'finall boss' - the Adversary - who can't be beat without constant use of nitro, or a lot of ammo pickups.   For the above reason, among others, Death Rally suffers in terms of replayability. Starting the campaign from scratch does not offer anything new, and will in fact play out nearly the same anyway (up to choice of stages). Playing a single campaign is a much better option, especially in small doses. A few races a day can offer a lot of fun and will delay the somewhat broken end-game long enough to diminish its impact.   The soundtrack is a good enough generic composition, fits well and doesn't get too annoying or repetitive. Sound effects are good too.",

What I didn't like: Not as gritty as the original Death Rally, and having to spend all your earnings on upgrades and repairs.  My recommendation: Going into this one expecting the classic may lead to disappointment, as a combat racer on its own, I'm having a blast with it. Nice for some casual racing.",

First of all It's a fun/good game in all matters. If you buy this thinking about the good old times of the 1996 version then you might get a little bit dissapointed. The depth of story and mechanics lacks short and if you though racing was about winning... Well in Death Rally it's all about staying behind and killing people to get parts to the next car.  There is no actual difficulty settings, as you can get in trouble by the first tier of vehicles when you already have a fully upgraded top car. Killing cars is also a bit more annoying as you never know for sure how long will it take to finish one off.  Game is indeed fun an all, but lacks emotion when comes to important aspects. Fans of the first version of the game will be sad to think this is the best they could make, and I'm glad I bought this on a sale because at full price I'd be a bit more sad.  ",

            "review_text": "I have mixed feelings about this game. On the one hand its alot of fun to race and blow all your opponents up but on the other hand it can get frustrating to get shot at all the time. I have really enjoyed this game from start to finish even though some of the achievements are nuts and hard to get. The thing that was frustrating for me was the game never fully going in to full screen mode. The option is there but it would never do it for me. The gamemodes can get repetitive at times if you are trying to grind away at kills and other things. The nice thing about all the achievements is that you don't need to play against a live human to get some of them. The 'Online' play can be done with bots, and the achievements for 'Online' can be done just like if you were playing against the computer. The cars can be customize which is a nice feature to have. The controls can feel crazy at first but with some practice you can get really good at fully controlling the car. If you like a full on shooter/racer game then this is the game to get. I mainly got it because I thought the achievements would be easy to get and for the most part they were, but some you will need alot of patience to get. I would say get it but make sure you get it while its on sale, then you will feel like you got your monies worth.",

It's a fun little game that'll keep you busy for a bit, but you'll only be able to play in single player mode, because NO ONE plays online. I've tried many times, and its not recommended to keep online mode on in this game because you'll lose the ranking you get working your way up in story mode.  Its not worth the $10. Now, while I haven't played the original or mobile game, I can say this version of the game sucks. I give this game a 3.2/10",

The old one was challenging as you had to win every race if you want to unlock new weapons, get better positions on the general scoreboard and get new and fast cars. It was the kind of racing game that made you feel proud when you win and mad when someone kill you in the last lap.  If you want to revive the experience this game is not for you. Why? Is really easy to win, and there is no point for doing it. You can just get new cars and weapons by killing your opponents and picking the parts they drop, and that is very boring. So there is no challenge, there is no fun, just an 'meh i´m gonna play it' game.",

However missing in this new version compared to the original is the ranking board, pedestrians (no blood in this version), good music (albeit this can be changed to your own tracks I believe) and the option to choose your own sabotage on your opponents in the store. It also would've been handy to save up money as you will need to spend everything earned after each race. (even if your current car is fully upgraded, the money is lost in that case)  All in all I still like the game alot, even tho it's been a bit toned down.",

Unfortunately, I did not do due dilligence to see how the game works. Instead of earning money and saving to buy cars/upgrades you are forced to find the parts in maps that you play. I kept trying to get into the game, but at the $5 or so I paid for it I don't want to spend any more time with it.   The graphics are nice, and the explosions are fun. The items to destroy on the maps are great, and add some excitement. It is auto fire, which might be able to be turned off but still turned me off. I mostly didn't like the career mode, but if you didn't play the original it could be fun. I wouldn't recommend it based on what I was expecting.",

Multiplayer is supposed to extend that time, but so far there are no other players... you just keep waiting for other people to join and they never do. This game has less character and a bit less snappy controls than the original, but nonetheless it is good value for the price and I do recomment it.",
