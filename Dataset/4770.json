            "review_text": "Rome: Total War - Alexander is a short campaign addition to the Rome: Total War game. It's a decent expansion, although the Barbarian Invasion expansion which is included in Rome: Total War Gold Edition is probably the superior of the two. Really, there's not much to say about the expansion other than it's more Rome: Total War - and that's always a good thing. If you liked the main game and want more, get the expansion. You won't be disappointed.",

When you play RTW's secondary expansion - Alexander - you can help but think; 'What could have been...' Quite similar to what I personally think on Alexander's untimely demise at still relatively youth stage.  The campaign is poor. The map was clearly made without either time or consideration. The factions are limited, whilst the units are even more limited. The best fun to be had is playing custom battles, or perhaps the somewhat disappointing historical battle recreations. As a stand alone game, free of the RTW franchise, Alexander may have been considered pretty decent, but when you consider that TCA made this AFTER Rome and the Barbarian expansion, you can tell they were just quickly milking the cow before moving onto another era.   5 out of 10 - If you're burning cash, get it. Otherwise, save yourself the time and money. Subpar expansion.",

Sadly after you've fought bitter desperate battles to capture your first 5 cities the game become rather easy and a bit unbalanced, allowing you the smash huge enemy armies with about a fifth of the troop number every time... Provided you remembered some skirmishers and a single unit of cavalry",
