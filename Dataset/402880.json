            "review_text": " TL/DR review:  An un-polished gem. Bring a loin cloth.    Indepth review:    Plays like:  Golden Axe + Rastan + Barbarian + Prince of Persia classic    The good:   - Great art style! Like a living Frazetta/Harryhausen hybrid.  - Combat is gory and satasfiying. Enemies get carved up and so do you.  - Lots of Boobs     The Bad:   - Many game breaking bugs.  - Controls don't appear to be properly mappable, a gamepad is a must.  - Combat is clunky at times, many enemies love to stun lock you. Enemies can be pushed off screen at times too.  - Annoying bug where the narrator keeps repeating himself nonstop about how fun it is to dismember.  - Poor translations and very little explanation in some areas.   The Verdict:    'An unpolished gem'   If you can overlook the many flaws in this game, you will have many fun hours of cleaving through dungeons and saving damsils in distress from horrible monsters. The developers seem to actually be addressing these issues and steadily patching it, So this game may yet shine.     ",

            "review_text": "A modern remake of the old classic, Barbarian 2 the Dungeon of Drax, hugely influenced by masters of barbarian fantasy art Vallejo and Frezetta. AoB EX is awesome. it looks good, but most of all it's fun to play. There are plenty of cool stuff to go around. Levels are designed really well providing a challenge to find all of the secrets the game hides which are in no way obvious.  Combat is varied and can be challenging. Granted some boss fights are trivial and some might be too difficult, but still you'll feel accomplishment beating them. Animations are mostly done really well however voice acting leaves much to be desired.  Overall it feels exactly like all those barbarian cult movies of the 80s and 90s, but packed in a quite fun game. It has it all, muscles, babes, naked bodies, dismemberment, wizards, hacking slashing, savages, traps, blood, gore.. all the good stuff.  It had a rocky start, but the devs worked each day and now it runs smooth. Definitely worth the price! It's not a AAA game, so don't expect one, but it does look great, even to todays standards.",

            "review_text": "One major problem I'm having with the game is that it's not allowing me to choose the female barbarian as a character. Every time I select her, it jumps me back to the main title screen. I'm having similar problems with trying to load/save games as the male barbarian. Every time I see a new update, I hope that these issues have been fixed, but so far they haven't, and it's preventing me from wanting to play the game. At the moment I can't really reccomand the game, as so far for me, it's unplayable.  EDIT: I contacted the support page about my issues, and received speedy replies that were able to help solve the technical problems I was having. The devs are on the ball, and are eager to help solve problems.  The game itself is what you would expect from some thing inspired by the likes of Robert E. Howard, and various sword and sorcery artists, and low budget fantasy films. If that's not your thing, then don't buy this game, and then complain about it being like that. If it is your thing, then sit back and enjoy :)",

            "review_text": "I had this game a long time ago on desura. It was a fun, gory and brainless Barbarian 2 inspired indie game.  It was far from perfect but it was a good nostalgia fix  I'm happy to see that the 'extended cut' version is finally released on steam. While still far from perfect, this new version is truly improved in many ways. Better visuals (reminiscent of what we used to see on Atari and Amiga back in the days), better and tighter control scheme (the dpad is finally working... so, no more stupid deaths while falling on pikes), extended map, a trade system etc.  So, should you buy it ?  Well, it highly depends on what you're looking for. If it's modern AAA titles you're after, you're clearly in the wrong place. On the other hand, if you still have fond memories of old school brawlers like Sword of Sodan and Barbarian II (the most obvious inspirations for this age of barbarian), you can hardly go wrong.  It has everything you crave about pulp heroic fantasy : gore, more gore, women with dressing issues (less is better than more), cheesy voiceover (imagine a Z movie version of John Milius' 'Conan the barbarian'), tough fights, warriors, slaves, sceneries straight out of a Boris Vallejo work etc.  You'll have to tolerate all the imperfections (and there's more than a few) but the ride though memory lane will be enjoyable.   I truly hope to see more games like this on steam.",
