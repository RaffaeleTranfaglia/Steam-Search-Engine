            "review_text": "Let me start off this review by saying that this game has a lot of potential.  However, it is sorely lacking. It should have been developed more before being released. Pros: Nice art style, kinda like an old RPG. Lots of freedom in what you do - sorta. You can explore a lot.  Cons: No instructions whatsoever, They tell you how to move around, but not where anything is, or how to do anything other than find the bartender. For God's sakes people, just put some signs up! Quests are all the same. You literally find all the same quests in difficulties you can't choose. It takes forever to get any money, especially in quests. This is compounded by the fact that you have to pay A LOT of taxes. I'd either remove the tax system, or make getting money much easier. The 'romance' is flat, one-sided, and doesn't take any 'story' progression at all. Seriously, this game needs a lot more work before I'd buy it, even for eight dollars. Also, the movement is shoddy.  Overall, needs work. It's a neat idea for a game, but they went a bit overboard in terms of NOT THINKING about what they were doing. I returned the game for steam cash within two hours.  Sorry if this seemed like a bash on the developers. This could be a fantastic little game, but it's not nearly there yet. Consider that before you buy the game. ",

            "review_text": "So, some people have been hating on this game. Yes it's unpolished, but the devs are trying to take care of that. Others are hating on how difficult/simpistic it is. Either hire a human basic cook at the beginning and sit on your hands wasting time away or lose in frustration to the Royal Tax Collector (who seems to be the biggest actual enemy in the game). But there's a pattern to everything. As of this review, all you have to do is remember six dates: the 5th, 15th, and 25th then the 6th 16th and the 26th. The first three are when the arena happens and at 1900 the organizer needs rooms for his guys. At the start an easy 300 gold. The second set of dates is when the true archvillain of the game shows up, the tax collector. Seriously? What tax collector shows up that many times in a single month? He's pocketin most of your harrd earned cash, no doubt. But, if you stockpile meals with the cook, open rooms slowly, you can easily deal with these obviously over TRITE obstacles. Just kill/gather enough to make up the differece and soon you'll be able to wander/kill/gather/kill to your herat's delight. And as a bonus, please take this into consideration: At 0600 (the start of the new day with the management screen popping up) everything resets. So, if you're in, let's say, a DRAGON HORDE MISSION, and you've cleared everything out and it's close to 0600, just wait there until afterwards and watch every chest close and refill with goodies. And don't forget about the Shadow Famliar. It can be a major boon if you take the time. The game is not perfect, but it is a very good time management sim that deserves some credit.",

            "review_text": "TLDR? Its pretty good, especially for the price, but low end computers might struggle a bit.   Hey there, if you're being discouraged by the bad reviews note that almost all of them are due to performance issues.  It doesn't seem to be optimized the best since I'm also getting fairly poor framerate, but I'm fairly certain that has more to do with my system than the game itself. He did update for a 'no effects' option and that has helped slightly.  The game has been very charming and entertaining so far. The visitors to your tavern all have different quirks and stories to tell, and the variety of crafting/pets its nice.  For its price I think this game is well worth it, especially if you have a system that can handle it well. Hopefully it will be optimized a little better here in the soon future for people like myself.  I'm not sure how limited RPG maker is, but I do have a couple suggestions for the developer, other than making the game run smoother.  1: Maybe make it so loot from baddies is auto picked up when walking over/near it. Sometimes when an enemy dies their loot gets sent flying behind some trees and it can be quite difficult to find.  2: More random events within the tavern. These travelers and heroes have character and it would be fun to see them interact more, maybe get into bar fights, have a druid accidentally set something on fire, that sort of deal. I'm not sure if these are already implemented as I'm still pretty early into the game.  3. Customization. Lots of people enjoy personalizing and making something their own. If possible maybe implement some sort of decorating system. (different flooring, wallpapers, rugs, tables, mats, etc. That can be placed where they want, so you can make it different.) It will make you feel more so like you've actually built it up from the ground.    Just a few suggestions, but otherwise its a real solid game so far, just needs some polish. Keep up the hard work and keep updating the game and it could go far.",

It does have a little lag, so lower end computer might have a harder time. The controls are easy and the story is very interesting. I believe it has quite the potential and am excited to see how the game progresses.  ",

            "review_text": "The idea is a very good one, not sure I enjoyed it though. At least it didn't hold my interest long and it had a bit of lag or framerate issues. The combat is strange at least as a druid, you have to face a certain direction and click and thats the way you fire and since you cant angle yourself you have to get in line with enemies before firing. Just a lot of little quirks like that, that should be worked out and it'd be a good game. May write more once I play it a bit longer. As of right now I wouldn't recomend it, but if they work on it some more and fix some issues then definitely.",

            "review_text": "  Where to start... Well, first off, I got this game for free to play, enjoy and do Let's Plays of. When I first started, I started with out a class, which in all honesty, was funny. Other than that, starting out, things worked great! Tutorial was pretty straight forward, (im just an idiot at times XD ), Things start off easy, getting customers and making food and all that. I like how you have to manage things, like making sure you have money to pay any employees you hire, cleaning up sick guests messes, the diversity of the races you have in your Tavern, etc.   A familiar, a great ally that can heal you, once you get a fountain repaired, is a wonderous thing. Even better is when you can repair cottages and have heroes to help you out. Makes things much easier to deal with, so you can gather more resources needed for things, like making food or crafting your own gear. And in the recent updates, you can ride a unipony, though I've yet to find one. And there's new merfolk beds just recently added as well. Combat is pretty fun. I've yet to try other classes, though I've been a Sword Saint since the beginning.    Each weapon has a interesting effect/animation when you attack regularly, like the Fall Sword has a bunch of stars that come out when you hit an enemy. Underworld sword has fire. Even heroes have weapons like that as well. Your allies don't die either, they just get knocked out. You can revive them with revive potions too. When you lose all your HP (if it doesn't bug and transfer control to a allied unit, though you should either let the hp get to 0 or rush the quest, cause if you strike at all with a companion, the game will crash) you go to your room in your tavern, so there's no game over.   You only lose a small amount of health or magic, which isn't a big deal! There's a few side quests, as well as the main ones and the quests you get from your customers. There's varying difficulties as well, ranging from easy, to impossible. I Suggest you don't take impossible, unless you have a couple allies with you, that being a familiar and at least 1 or 2 heroes. It's a fun, casual RPG. A lot of the time, it's hard for me to quit the game, even after finishing an episode of it, because it's addicting to me. Like all RPG's though, there IS some grinding, but you don't have to grind too much, really. Oh! Also, there's someone that everyone 'loves'. It's the Tax Collector as well! Giving him other things, like food or piety helps reduce the tax costs, though, if you're making enough money and don't want to sacrifice anything else, pay in full.    It's honestly not that much, compared to what you'll be making. Basing the taxes on number of people and rooms and such, can be a pain, but it's nothing you can't fix :D. The music is fairly interesting too. It seems to change after every few screens I think, I couldn't pinpoint the timing on that ha ha. Things only got better with updates/patches. Over all, it's a fairly enjoyable game! Sure, it had some bugs here and there, but most of them weren't game killing. By that I mean, making your game crash. Definitely worth playing!",
