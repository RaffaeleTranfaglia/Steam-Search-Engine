            "review_text": "For such a cheap price at release i.e. 80% off the usual £3.99, I had more fun playing this Tower Defense (TD) game than I've had playing a lot of games I've paid 20 times as much for. Defend Your Life is a typical TD game with the usual tower purchases, for example upgradeable cannons and tesla towers, as well as other towers that slow units down or toss grenades, plus there are special towers such as those that give you extra oxygen. Oxygen is the currency in game which allows you to purchase more towers and upgrades, plus at the end of each level you are awarded tablets and diamonds, both of which can be spent either on upgrading your tower defenses or on special upgrades that can only be used once to top up other defenses that usually take time to recover such as the electric shock , bomb or adrenaline.   The theme of this TD game is biological, with a human body being attacked by viruses. Each level gradually takes you further into the body. You can set the speed up to four times the normal speed and/or select from three different difficulties. Even at full price I think Defend Your Life is a bargain. I reckon most TD fans will enjoy this game and it's also an excellent introduction for those new to the genre. The easy mode is relatively easy to beat. I played through several levels with no losses. The harder levels give less currency to buy the various upgrades and the speed of the viruses are increased, plus you get less oxygen currency to start with.    With 22 different enenies, all with different strengths and weaknesses, for example the flu virus divides into two weaker flu viruses when it is killed and the Nicotinic unit disappears when first hit and is immune from attack while invisible, at least from the tower defenses. You can still damage these with bombs and electric shocks.  There's a tips and tricks section as well as an encyclopedia that gives you information about each building, for example the Tesla tower does more damage for each shot than any other tower, but takes a longer time to recharge. There are some nice little touches like the defensive towers that when activated create little beings that don't do actual damage, but block the path of incoming viruses. When damaged they recover fairly quickly. If destroyed new ones will replace them before the next wave. You can start the next wave early by clicking on the warning symbol that pops up near the place where the viruses first appear. The quicker you do this, the more oxygen is added to your total, giving you more currency to buy or upgrade towers.  The 20 achievements for this game are relatively easy to attain, so long as you can survive the waves of viruses. You can see a video of game play   HERE  . I highly recommend this game",

Expect to be constantly redoing missons. Also there's hardly any variety in the towers. Kinda boring. I quit halfway through the campaign. There are much better games out there.",

So I think it is a good one for people trying tower defense for the very first time - you can easily learn that kind of game with this one. But if you are already into it, the setting is a really nice twist: You don't just defend a castle, a town or the like, you have to defend your body against different kinds of pathogens which all have their strengths and weaknesses you have to adapt your defense to.",

            "review_text": "3/10 just not cutting it. There are a lot of TD games out there. Some are pretty good games by any standard. Some are lazy half-♥♥♥♥♥ mobile ports. This is definitely the latter.  The game itself is fairly standard, but lacking. 4 tower types with very limited upgrade routes for each, fairly cliche creeps, the 'help from above' drag and drop weapons, etc. What it lacks in imagination, it makes up for in incompetent execution. Text boxes literally cut out mid letter, there are no graphical options, no fullscreen, nothing like that. It does actually work without constantly crashing, and it's OK for a while, but it just doesn't bring anything new or impressive. TLDR:  IF you see this game at a HEAVY discount ANDIF you already own LITERALLY every other TD game on steam ANDIF you've played them ALL right through. THEN replay Kingdom Rush, and give the money you saved not buying this game to a random stranger, because the look on their face when you do will be 1000 times more entertaining than this game and stay with you longer.",

This was a truly fun game and I felt bad that I got my copy either 'Humble Bundle', 'Indie Gala', or 'Bundle Stars' and not just buy it outright like I should have to show the creators of this game that it is worth paying for outright.",
