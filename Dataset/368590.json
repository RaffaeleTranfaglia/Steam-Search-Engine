The game is alright, some of hte puzzles are clever if relying too much on reflex. It's got polish, but - the full game feels more like a demo than an actual full game. It's... it has promise, but it's not worth buying until it's finished.",

Many of the puzzles are quite ingenious, the action gets intense, and there actually is some interesting backstory going on (maybe? who knows how much is canon with this game) if you pay attention to what's going around you. I've been having a lot of fun with this game and I think other players looking for a challenge will as well.",

Honestly, for the first few minutes I was in awe of how perfect the mood felt in this game. Aside from the beautiful soundtrack and environments, you're going to find puzzles of varying difficulty. What's unique about this game is that some of these puzzles really force you to think outside of the box - something that can be hard for puzzle platformers to accomplish. You really need to understand all of the things you can do with your abilities and how they can be used in the environment. The most rewarding thing about this game though is the thrill and excitement you get from completing one of the boss sequences. After finishing the episode in about 3 hours, all I can say is that I'm still hungry for more and bring on episode 2!",

            "review_text": "Can't recommend because of seriously bad level design. But before I get to game design, I would also like to scold this game's art design, which is bland and repetitive — Limbo had variety despite anything and everything being a shade of black or gray, this game takes place all in one location, does not differentiate white walls which you can walk past and white walls which you can't, and it has one design for every tree and usable item on all and any levels. But I digress: back to game design. You don't lose automatically if you failed to do a puzzle correctly, you have to kill yourself everytime —&nbsp;either this was a really weird (not to mention morally wrong) propaganda of suicide, or, more likely, aforementioned bad game design. Lost a rock needed to complete a puzzle? Kill yourself. Didn't take out a box needed to complete the puzzle in time? Kill yourself. Kill yourself, kill yourself, kill yourself. -10/10, best suicide simulator ever. Also, the mouse controls are stiff and inconvenient, it feels like controlling Mario in ice levels, doubly so when you need to use the mouse to move an item with your superabilities, which takes a good chunk of game time; no wonder this game wasn't released on PS or XBox, controlling the cursor with the twin sticks would've been an almost impossible and tedious chore. By the by, those superabilities you have are never actually explained, presumably you have to go through the questionably-needed process of decyphering this game's almost non-existent storytelling, which consists of a couple of 'cutscenes' on in-game engine, and a few 'letters', which are actually drawings, sent to you by, presumably, a girl you were in orphanage with. Soundtrack is okay, I guess, but I wouldn't go so far as to call it good, in my opinion it sounds like most of the electronic bands of early 2000's, a-la De-Phazz, which is... well, it's an acquired taste, and not one that actually pays off in human society when acquired.   Overall, if you've literally played through every single other platformer existing and still want more, this game will satisfy your craving somewhat. Otherwise, it's kind of a bore.  Edit: Also, you kill a lot of sheep in this game, for no real reason whatsoever — it's a strange and purposely cruel game mechanic; you use sheep as bait, food for wolves, even as torches. Possibly creators wanted to show us our cruelty, telling us 'you people will even kill harmless and innocent animals to get what you want', but it's doubtful, because A) it's really dumb and B) it only works if the player has a choice, which the player doesn't have in this game at all. No, actually, there was this one time where you could either get to a next checkpoint on the surface, or by means of underground tunnel. No, there wasn't any difference as a result of that. No, I don't know why the included this 'choice' in the level design either.",

It felt a lot like limbo, if you've played that (2d platformer with puzzles and a story you have to assume a lot about) but with more distinct puzzles.  [spoilers] I did really enjoy the puzzle solving elements of the game. The electricity powers felt especially neat (telekinesis and powering stuff.)   [spoilers] My two major complaints was that it felt unpolished, and that it was (spoilers) 'incomplete.' As far as the former goes, there were some visual issues and physics problems. Plus, the whole 'shoot the rock to get it into the pipe' is a neat idea but fell through for me personally. Now, let's move on to the incomplete thing. It's a 'to be continued' game. Basically the two issues detailed above make it feel like a late beta version, with a lot of content to be added later.  Ultimately, for $5 (or $1, since it seems like it's on sale a lot) albert and otto is super worth it. Definitely give it a try.",

Looking forward to Episode 2. :)",
