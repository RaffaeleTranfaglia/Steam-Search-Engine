            "review_text": "[UPDATE] The rubber banding I experienced at first is only a problem in the beginning, it seems. After some ship upgrades I have been able to beat opponents by more than ten seconds. Still enjoying the handling and feel of everything, although I wish the career had a little more character - some rival portraits would have gone a long way, for instance. Still, the game so far is pretty much what I hoped for, and I hear there's even a proper time trial mode on the way. I will add my final thoughts when I've progressed far into the campaign and played some multiplayer.  [First impressions] - game is extremely pretty; an explosion of colors and sexy futuristic shapes. The controls are tight and demanding. Really does feel like a cross between Wipeout and F-Zero. I'm a little worried about the AI though, it seems to have a lot of rubber banding.",

            "review_text": "I remember playing F-Zero GX on the gamecube years ago. It was a great, extremely-fast paced racer that had numerous tracks, a great soundtrack, and lots of replayability. Unfortunately, Nintendo seems to have left F-Zero on the shelf in an undisclosed basement and we have not seen much hyperspeed hovercar racers in a long time, let alone on the PC platform.  Suddenly, I heard about this game 1 DAY before it launched, claiming to be a 'tribute' to games like F-Zero. Having played it for several hours, I can say it's a solid tribute, though not without a few cracks.  Let me get my criticisms out of the way first:     The difficulty of this game is all over the place. Most of the time, I had no issues getting gold    or platinum    on my first attempts. Sometimes, the events were challenging, but still doable. However, there are a few events that are ridiculously hard,  especially  the first pure race that you are allowed to do. I don't mind a hard challenge, but you shouldn't kick a newbie's teeth in when...     There is no tutorial to explain some of the mechanics. I know the loading screen tips told me to pitch up to avoid scraping on the ground, which would lower my speed, but I don't know why I should avoid blackouts or redouts or if there is some trick to improve my pure racing performance. I also didn't know I could upgrade my vehicle until I saw someone's gameplay video. Basically, a little hand holding for new players would be much appreciated.     The AI seems a little finicky. Some tracks, it manages to perform well to be really difficult to pass (hence the issue with pure races), but on other tracks, it slows down heavily at certain bends that makes it way too easy to stay in front.   However, despite these issues, I'm willing to overlook it as the rest of the game is really well designed.     The game has a really cool sci-fi look, almost like a simulation.     The controls are great and feel similar to F-Zero (with a few tricks of its own).     The SPEED is aaaaaaaaaAAAAAaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaawesome!     Really great track designs, with some having really cool moments.     Excellent dynamic soundtrack.  I hope the developers can continue to work on this game, as I would love to see it just tweaked a bit more to become even better. It's not perfect, but it's probably the closest we'll get to an F-Zero game on the PC.",

Sure, you've explored older crazy fast racing games, and maybe you even picked up Fast Racing Neo on the WiiU, but that's still not enough. Then a ray of light shines through the clouds, and suddenly you are bathed in the glory of Redout. Inspired by crazy fast racing games of yore but with ideas and ambitions of its own Redout is a fine adition to the family of AG racers. With a large amount of even types, 6 ship types to pick from with 4 tiers each, an equippiable (and upgradeable) passive and active skill for those non-pure events, and 4 stat categories that you can upgrade, 4 track themes each with a multitude of unique feelings tracks, a seemingly Wipeout inspired soundtrack but with compositions set to fit the track rather than on a playlist, VR support, top-notch visual presentation and a feeling of speed I've been wanting to experience for a long long time Redout is a must buy for any fans of the genre, especially those wanting this type of game to make its way back to PC. My only two complaints are that you can't place bots in online multiplayer matches (So that is only 2 other people are in the lobby you can still fill out the other slots until new players join) and you can't fully customize gamepad controls. Why isn't LB set to use your active power-up? Why X?  TLDR; I've had a fantastic time with Redout, its full of great stuff, futuristic racing fans should pick it up.",

The art style is delightfully simple. The frame rate seems very stable. The music is awesome and gives you a great rush when you're doing really well on a track.   Some feedback for the devs:  Personally, I would love a short tutorial on the mechanics. I played a bit of Mario Kart, so I was somewhat aware of strafing around turns, but with no visible feedback that my strafes were helpful, I wasn't sure (until I ran the same track a few times) that it was even doing anything. Maybe something that just runs through what each of the markings on the track mean as you go through a run, and some tips/tricks.  Currently, your powerups are bound to the X button with seemingly no way to change. This forces me to take my thumb off my right stick to activate them, which is a pain with ones like the Magnetic Grip that's useful to activate going into a turn. But what's strange is, the RB isn't being used by anything. Could the powerup button be swapped to the RB?  There are a few missing words and odd syntax/spellings, like the 'Do You (sic) wish to' bit when you want to go back to the main menu. Not the end of the world by any means. Just something I noticed a couple times.  All in all, I was glad I dropped the $31.",

Using the Unreal Engine 4, Redout is a tour-de-force of eye popping visual design, exciting gameplay, tight and responsive controls and blistering framerates.   The two stick controls work to perfection in controlling your racers with the ability to hug corners or pull up or push down the front of your ship, making hills or tight turns come to heel.  The track design is outstanding with a great variety of visual goodies, loops, corkscrews, huge jumps and big banking turns....basically fantastic rollercoaster type tracks. You'll even encounter sandstorms, rain and other weather elements that add to the look, feel and play of the tracks.  Worth every bit of the asking price! 5/5",

The gameplay is a bit tricky at first, but at some point the control scheme just 'clicks' and you start burning magnet at 1500 km/h, much as it did with the original Wipeout games.  I have been exclusively playing the game in VR personally. While it is not an extremely polished VR implementation, I have had minor issues such as judder during menu's and loading screens (but not in game thankfully). They have also ommitted any actual Cockpit mode, aparently due to it causing motion sickness for their beta testers. They claim to be working on perfecting the cockpit mode for motion sickness but the fact they couldnt include it on launch is a bit of a dissapointment because it would have been amazing. The views for VR that are included are 'face on the road' or 'sitting on top of your ship'.  Other than that it has been an absolute blast. Wipeout style anti-grav racers are a dying bread and in sore need of a solid title to bring them back into focus. Redout is exactly that .. only its actually faster. It's Wipeout at the speed of Extreme G.  I fully recommend it.",

I higly recommend this game for anyone who enjoys extremly fast paced racing games.   Positives:   - The feeling of Speed is absolutly perfect. I have never played a faster yet controllable racer in my life - The Graphics are amazing. Not over the top yet colorfull and flashy.  - The Controll over your Racer is incredible. ( You do need a controller though, without it this might suck since you need both analog sticks.) At first you will crash into every wall but when you realize that you absolutly have to utilize the second controll stick you dont need the brake at all.  Negatives:  - No lokal COOP. Its sad that this simple feature is missing. There is online play, though with a small playerbase - The AI is godlike in the early levels and way too easy in the later levels. This might be the biggest downside of the game. The first levels are simply hardly beatable in a satisfiing manner and when you get further into the game the AI seems to fall appart a little. They just cant take the curves as well as a human beeing could. This needs adressing especially since the multiplayerbase is so small.   In conclusion this is the fastest racing game i have ever played and remindet me a lot about StarWars Episode I Racer. I cannot compare it to Wipeout since i have never played it. If you like fast racing games with a high skill ceiling this is the game for you. 8/10 ",

Now, I'm not going to whine about the computer just because this game is hard (and trust me it is very hard at times), but I'm going to provide a specific example that shows how the AI can be pretty frustrating sometimes.  On the first race against AI that the game gives you, I found myself coming in 4th constantly even though I was getting below (faster than) gold medal track times that the previous time trial mode of this map had set. No big deal. But then I started to notice something weird. Every time I attempted this race, I started to get faster and faster, however, my times were still translating into 4th place. Finally, I decided to start writing down my times. Around 2:06.5 finally got me to a bronze and then a silver medal, although I had gone this fast before and only gotten 4th. Now I was ready to attempt gold. I put in the performance of my life. I wasn't touching the sides of the course, I hit every boost pad and used my own boost well, there were no collisions between me and the AI, etc. I ended the race with a time of 2:05 flat...and a silver medal. Now I'm glad that the game challenges me to improve my time, but at what point is it just cheap AI vs a fair challenge.   I'm enjoying this game a lot, but it's also very frustrating. For every 5 gold medals I have in other races, there always seems to be one or two where I can't crack bronze or silver for god knows why.  Tl;dr Purchase this game if you're not easily discouraged by losing. It really is the best F-Zero/Wipeout style game to exist since those masterpieces, and if you can't handle the AI, you can always just play online.  8.5/10  *Update: I just improved my time some more on that race to 2:03.7, and that still equated to a silver medal.",

If you're not familiar with the above titles, though, now we've got something to talk about. Redout is the ultimate arcade racing game. It doesn't pretend to be fully realistic, and it doesn't even have wheels. Instead, you're going to pilot some sleek hovering rockets around rollercoaster-like courses at, if you're any good, hypersonic speeds.   If that sounds daunting, well, this game is a little out there. But it's not that hard to pick up. I'm really not a racing aficionado, but I got the hang of it in an hour or two. You'll be strafing and pitching your craft as well as steering it, and it's designed so that every single course is doable without touching the brakes. Let me tell you, though, after just a few laps you'll be really digging the intense sensation of  speed .  Heads up, though. You can't remap the controls, and you  really  ought to be playing with a dualstick controller. No idea if racing wheels or joysticks work, but I suspect they might not. I also haven't tried the VR, so I can't vouch for it here. Graphics requirements aren't too crazy but you definitely won't run this on a toaster like you might some indie games on Steam.   tl;dr - If you like going fast and you're okay with a more arcadey feeling, this game is for you.",

It's a pretty good antigrav/arcade racer (if a bit clunky) but it serves as a reminder that there will never be another Wipeout.  Good: - Visually gorgeous, simplistic style with great effects - Decent music - Good controls/sense of speed - Interesting track designs - Motion looks amazing at 144hz* - With enough speed you can take a jump and fly up to the edge of the skybox - Boss mode is something I've never seen before and is legitimately interesting. Like many racing games, Redout re-uses locations for different tracks but in boss mode, you switch between tracks in the same area multiple times DURING the race, leading to very long laps and also meaning you need to be familiar with them beforehand as the track switching throws you into different parts of each track in a strange order.  Poor: - Redout/Greyout mechanic does nothing for actual gameplay When hitting sharp declines or inclines, you're meant to pitch down or up respectively so you don't see a colour tint effect for half a second. The only time this matters is on extreme inclines so you don't scrape your ship against the ground. - No rebindable keys, not even an alternate layout I would have liked to make the arrow keys turn and A and D strafe, seeing as that's how most games in existence use WASD. - Music tracks are assigned to specific race tracks, which repeat constantly. (1 song per track) Some of the songs also have distracting beeping noises that sound like a low health alarm or something. - Some of the worst A.I. I've seen in a racing game. On tracks full of tight corners they get left in the dust and frequently hit walls but if you pass them in a gentle/straight area (even with a fully upgraded vehicle) regardless of your speed they immediately rocket in front and 'magnetise' to a distance about 5 car lengths ahead, and will continue doing that until another series of tight corners. - Uneven difficulty curve. The first 10 or so events I didn't see another driver outside of the start of the race, then suddenly the aforementioned rubber banding kicked in. Track designs also do not flow well, especially in Alaska. - *Graphical settings do not save. Every time I launch the game I need to raise the max fps, turn off motion blur and turn off v-sync. - COULDN'T TOP SKYNYRD Everything in Redout that tries to emulate the feel of Wipeout, from the announcer to some of the menus to the ship designs, just makes me want to play Wipeout instead. Which I did, and after playing more Wipeout Pure on PPSSPP it's GAME OF THE CENTURY",

If the graphics looked dated or not up todays high definition standards don’t worry, you won’t be looking at them very much during game play. Your eyes are going to be glued to the track, preparing for the upcoming turns that will need just the right amount of pitch and yaw to advance you into the next round. REDOUT plays extremely smooth and fast. Once your craft starts moving you’ll soon find yourself performing an unavoidable habit of tilting and leaning in your seat trying to get the right body English. Raising the controller swinging it left or right during turns and loops won’t help but seems to happen all too often. 34Bigthings has done a great job filling the gap left behind for a fast paced anti-gravity racer.",

            "review_text": "Updated on 9/6/2016 below original review.  More Wipeout than F-Zero.  Redout is a good and well-made game that will please long time Wipeout fans but may leave die hard F-Zero fans wanting.  Regardless of which old series you prefer, though, there's a lot to like and appreciate here. First and most important is the sense of speed which Redout delivers handily. The game moves satisfyingly fast and vehicle handling provides a 'just barely in control' sensation. Ships slide, bank, and bob over the track and convey the feeling one would expect from an 'anti-gravity' racing ship. That slippery feel and the sense of weight conveyed are what make Redout feel more like Wipeout than F-Zero.   Ship combat, health, and energy managment are present. These mechanics are challenging but rewarding to perfect. Unlike F-Zero ship health and ship energy are separate meters and both recharge on their own based on your selected ship's rating in that area.  Combat, unlike Wipeout, is not proejctile-based. There are no guns or missles, only weapons that will temporarily slow down or inhibit your adversaries' abilities. Keeping combat mostly non-lethal is a welcome relief from Wipeout while the added complexity over F-Zero is a welcome addition to the experience. Ultimately, if you can out-race your opponents then combat can largely be avoided.  Avoiding contact with the walls and scraping the track are key to maintaining your ship's health meter. This is challenging when racing at such high speeds and on such tight and winding tracks. Finding that perfect line and taking corners at insane speeds is especially rewarding in Redout.  I haven't see all of the tracks so far but what I have seen is certainly good. So far, though, I haven't found any cylidrical tracks or racing inside tubes. Furthermore--and again more in common with Wipeout--the tracks are pretty narrow. And even when the track does appear to open up the usable space is still slim because there aren't many long straightaways. I feel wanting for F-Zero GX style courses that are wide and long with fewer insanely tight turns.  Finally, the game performs very well on my machine running all settings maxed out at 1440/60 frames per second. My specs: i5 3570 / 16 GB RAM / GTX 980 Ti.  Update:  After putting in a few more hours and making it through more of the career mode I maintain that Redout has more in common with Wipeout than F-Zero if only from the ship handling perspecitve. The handling model in the Redout is not bad by any means. I went in to the game hoping for F-Zero style handling; responsive, tight, and agile. Across the board every ship feels unresponsive, slippery, and unwieldy. This is the fundamental difference between Wipeout and F-Zero and ultimately is what keeps me away from Redout. I have been putting in effort to learn Redout, though. I have earned one platinum medal and a handful of gold medals in class I and class II races. Honing one's skills and becoming better at the game is not impossible and, certainly for the Wipeout fans, should come easy enough.  Contrary to my original review there are, in fact, tracks where you race inside a tube. But it was very shortlived because the track itself was quite short. And so far I have yet to find a track that opens up as wide as an F-Zero track.",

            "review_text": "NOTICE: If you're familiar with Wipeout, set the control scheme to 'Classic'. If you use a Steam Controller, set the control scheme to 'Classic'. Thank me later.  This is the best AG racer to date. The physics model feel like a good mix between the F-Zero and Wipeout franchises, with a little Star Wars Episode 1 Pod Racers mixed in. If you're familiar with any of those games, you'll know more or less what to expect here.  What sets this apart from the former games is strafing, which replaces the air-brakes from Wipeout and feels like a new beast to master since this single axis of motion can be used in many different ways.  Here's how it works. Strafing moves you directly sideways without changing the direction of your ship. This allows you to dig into turns slightly more than steering alone, like a weaker version of Wipeout's air brakes. It also helps you line up with boost pads, as expected.  Its most important function, however, is drifting. To drift, you start steering into a turn before you reach it, but strafe in the opposite direction. This allows you to rotate your ship and maintain most of your speed, and the rotation, through the turn without hitting walls. When done proprely, you can take extremely sharp turns at very high speeds. Functionally, the motion looks similar to effective counter-steering in a power-slide in Mario Kart 7 or 8, but the joystick input is inverted and you have much more control over how you slide and rotate.  As with any racing game with a brand new physics or handling model, your first few races will be punishing. The difficulty curve after the first few races is pretty gradual but rewarding, just like any good Wipeout game.  The graphics are also gorgeous just like the screenshots (I'm running an R9 390 and can run near maximum settings, though with low AA). The art style is consistent and every set of shaders and effects complements that style really well.  There is one issue though, and it's not completely terrible but it's annoying. Portals cause massive framerate drops as you approach them, even when the other side of them isn't rendered. While this usually isn't bad enough to cause any problems with the gameplay, the stutter itself is noticeable and can be distracting. Lowering graphical settings only marginally helps. These framerate drops need to be fixed.  Overall, I HIGHLY reccomend this game to any fan of AG racers. It really sets a new standard for the genre.   On VR support: It's alright. The constant movement can be somewhat nauseating or headache inducing on some maps and the sense of speed is hindered by a lack of FOV effects. The camera's orientation in relation to the ship's pitch is odd in some places (especially on large drops). It also lacks a cockpit mode (which would fix the previous issue). While the game remains quite pretty and the sense of scale is good, the other issues don't make it worth playing through entirely in VR. If you're buying this only for VR, just don't yet.",

As of now I'm very happy with the game and have played 12 solid hours of it. There DOES still seem to be a big difficulty ramp between class 2 and 3, but that might just be me sucking at the game.  Original review below:  This game is SO CLOSE to what I'd hoped it would be. The gameplay is great. The controls are awesome. I really like the ability to upgrade stuff and the powerups. Graphics are very cool, soundtrack works great. Game works great on my nowadays lower-end computer even at full graphics!  Still, as others have said the difficulty on this game is ALL OVER the place. The VERY FIRST race you go through is tough as nails. I STILL Haven't gotten beyond 3rd place, even after having gotten gold in most subsequent races. On other later races, I got first place the first time through without hardly trying. I've tried different ships, upgrades, and powerups. I really don't think that I'm the problem here. Also, if you haven't played the game, races are categorized into classes, preventing you from getting a super sweet ride and just blowing through the lower tier difficulties. Stragety is very important in this game no matter the class, which is great! But it also means that some races are unnecessarily difficult.  This game is in SERIOUS need of a difficulty patch. The gameplay itself doesn't need altered in any way that I'd personally say, but the difficulty definitely needs smoothed out. The first couple events you should nail first place no problem, but then it should get harder from there.  In short, this is a REALLY REALLY great racer with a bad difficulty curve in the campaign. I still highly recommend the game, but I'm hoping for a big patch soon.",

            "review_text": "If you have loved the Anti-Gravity genre, then you will love Redout. The controls are good, (unless you're using a keyboard, please don't) the music is great, (It dynamically changes as you progress in a race, playing segments in random order and at appropiate intensity) and the graphics are incredibly good, even on my craptop I'm running. Did I mention it's well optimized?  The career mode will keep you occupied for quite awhile. I was nearing the end of Class III events until the newest update made my completion go down to nearly 50%! The difficulty does not come from the AI's of the game, in fact I see them making mistakes quite often, such as missing boost pads or falling off the course. If you gain a lead, you gain a lead. The real difficulty comes from the courses, which I find to be great! F-Zero always had great courses, but usually their designs were overshadowed by the AI racers always being on your ♥♥♥. Here, the AI isn't that much of a problem and not even all the events have AI in them. I enjoy that to win, you have to learn and master the courses.  Course learning and getting accustomed to different events, such as time trial, survival, speed, and races aren't all you're doing. Instead of picking a ship and thinking 'Okay, I'll wing it with this one and see if it works.' it's moreso 'What fits my playstyle?' From there, you can further improve the ship's stats with incredibly easy to earn money. You won't be rolling in it if you plan to buy every single upgrade for every ship, especially the later ones, but you shouldn't need to grind a lot. Furthermore, you can get a passive and active powerup that fits your playstyle. Have a ship that has poor grip? You can add a huge boost to its handling, with the only cost being you miss out on the other powerups. Find yourself at low health a lot? Use a repair kit so you can keep flying at max speed without having to worry about the walls killing you, but you may miss out on that other powerup that lets you drain all your boost in one go for extra speed. They're great, and don't negatively affect the game.  Still feel like you don't like the powerups, or have become too reliant on them and you need to break the crutch? Pure versions of events exist where no powerups are allowed, just your ship and its upgrades. Not only that, but some powerups are useless in specific events, like the ones that have no AI racers. Redout encourages you to switch ships and be flexible with your powerups. It's certainly possible to use one set of ships (One set of ships are divided into 4 classes, they are stock upgrades from eachother but can only compete in events of the same class) but it's heavily encouraged to play multiple ships and powerups. It's things like these, that change up the gameplay and keeps things fresh that makes Redout worth its price tag. The career mode is a cycle of new things, constantly. Can you master this course? Now can you beat other racers? Now can you sustain a certain speed? Now try another course! Ooh, a new location! Oh, now you can use the next class of ships! Now try to go through the past course with a brand new toy at your disposal! And it all ends with the coup de grace of all modes. Boss mode.  Boss mode is gauntlet. All the courses of a location, back-to-back, connected via portals. NO STOPS. The name is fitting, as it takes everything you've learned and puts it all into one test. Remember this really hard turn? Remember to boost here for extra speed and no danger? Remember to tilt your ship here? (The ship can take damage from G force on sharp hills, or scratch the ground on sharp inclines) Everything is excellently weaved together.  Redout's only problem? Not enough people are playing it. The career mode is great, but you can't have a racing game without multiplayer! Only a few hundred play at peak hours, trying to set up a lobby at any other times will have an unfulfilling wait time. Plus, the more money the devs get, the more courses they can make (This is no speculation, the free Europa DLC is evidence of this!), the more ships they can add, and the more features they can implement! (Splitscreen: coming soon!)  Don't wait now, the Winter Steam Sale is on at the writing of this review! Buy it!  10/10",

Now I've seen a lot and I play a lot of racing games, but GOD DAAAAMN!   Literally everytime you upgrade to a new class or upgrade your turbo you get this new 'AAAAAAAAAAA it's fast, I CAN BARELY HANDLE THE SPEED' feeling.  I don't know how to describe it in any other way. I played F-Zero X on the N64 when I was a child and this the first game that even crosses that speed feeling.   If you like race just a tiny bit and are ok with space aesthetics, GET THIS GAME.  I have paid so much money for bad racing games, that promise you everything. If you like it fast, then this is what you are looking for. I promise :)",

Probably the best OST of any game I've played in a long time. An actual sense of speed, something I find many modern games lack. Upgrades have a noticable impact.  Sadly, it does lack the ability to remap controls manually. Hopefully this will be added at some point!  9/10 because there's only presets for the controls.",
