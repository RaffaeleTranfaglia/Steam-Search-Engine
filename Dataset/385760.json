            "review_text": "I'm going to write an honest review for this game since A LOT of people seem to be very biased.  This is not a perfect game. No 2K basketball game will ever be a perfect game. Does that mean this game is bad? No. Should you hold off on the game for now? Probably.  Let's start with the positives:  - A lot of people seem to gloss over the fact that 2K rehauled a lot of mechanics for this game. Shot meters feel more legitimate, this game is MUCH much more realistic (fouls, shot tendencies, etc...) This game is better and more fluid to control, and the gameplay reflects each players' ratings (defense, shots, etc...) much more accurately.  - Online play seems to be better and more fluid. I've yet to encounter any latency issues online with quick play and the such.  - MyCareer is MUCH better than last years. There is no cheesy story and the cutscenes feel much more integrated into the game. Orange Juice and dynamic duos are a great idea in general. The UI for MyCareer (and the game in general) is so much cleaner and more functional.  - The game is visually beautiful, not much else to say on the matter.  Now, the cons:  - Help defense is broken. It's quite ridiculous that 2K hasn't fixes this lingering issue in such a long time but it's still there. This is a BIG issue in MyCareer and not quite as bad in other modes since you can manually control players.  - Stat allocation is broken. This is a huge issue in MyCareer and has deterred me from playing the mode any more until 2K fixes this issue. Introducing the idea of stats that can only be raised in practice is actually quite a neat idea. However, these boosts are not permanent, even though 2K has stated they are. This is detrimental and demoralizing and discourages players from playing the game more. Limit caps are ridiculously strict as well. 2K NEEDS to fix these issues ASAP.  - Numerous glitches.  - 2K introduced broken mechanics along with the good mechanics. Ankle breakers are now pathetically easy to pull off (using Stephen Curry behind the back moves is a surefire way to have your defender fall). Moving screens are now a thing.   I would hold off on buying this game until 2K patches it. There are just too many issues with the game that prevent it from being a playable game. I like this game. I really do. That's why I'm hoping 2K listens to the community and starts working on the issues at hand immediately.",

            "review_text": "The most frustrating version yet. The game constantly stops gameplay to force some bogus cut-away animation/statistics down your throat. BY FAR THE WORST PART OF THIS GAME. There is no button to force past these animations, which wastes around 5min during each game.   Passing system is broken. 3 seperate buttons to pass and it still goes to the wrong person, especially when passing to the guy cutting to the basket (ball gets passed beyond the paint to the covered 3pt player in the corner.) AI teammates on fast breaks are terrible. They never cut to the wide-open paint.  Ball thrown-in glitches still abound, wasting player time during each game. Shot-meter glitches still persist. Character animation glitches occur occassionally with major physics-defying movements. The sheer number of bricked open-shots has made me close to rupturing a blood vessel in my eye with frustration. Unguarded full-court 3-pt shot percentage has been recorded far too high during the course of a season. Teammate AI defense is terribly poor- defenders have a hard time staying on their man, even off the ball.  Online play is almost non-existant. Found one game in 3 hours of online game-finding.  I sooo regret purchasing this game. This game took years off my life.",

            "review_text": "I guess i'll give my two cents. Since EA refuses to create any PC games, for NBA live or Madden I appreciate 2K continuing to release a PC version. Overall I have found the game enjoyable and would recomend the game to any NBA fan. I especially like playing the MyCareer game mode and have spent most of my time playing it. This is the third time I've purchased an NBA game from 2K the last one being NBA 2k12. My PC has windows 10 and a 1080GTX card I've seen a few minor graphical gliches as well as one crash but nothing major that would cause me to regret purchasing the game.  If you are someone that hasn't purchased NBA 2k in a while like myself, you will most likely be disappointed when you discover the implementation of 'Virtual Currency' better know as VC. VC is used to buy things in the game which at first doesnt sound to bad until you realize it's tied into upgrading your player's stats. This is a common practice in free-2-play games that introduces pay walls to get people to pay for the game. Bascially you're paying them 'not' to play the game to skip all the boring grinding game play. Just like any other free-2-play game they've added a varitey of ways to get small amounts of VC for free in the game, but not enough unless you plan on playing for several hours. In Mycareer they introduced player practices that allow you to do a variety of things to help unlocking upgrades as well as give small increases in attributes. This is the grind mode of the game that you will want to skip at some point once the newness wares off. If you want to go back and create a new player to try out the different positions and skills sets offered in the game you'll be stuck with the same routines wanting to reach for your wallet to avoid playing this part of the game. If this was a free-2-play game I wouldn't complain to much since this is how the development team gets paid for their work. However NBA 2k17 is not a free-2-play game why is VC tied to upgrading a players attributes for a game that I've already paid for? Cosmetic content I can see, but player attributes? Really? It seems like a very shady buisness practice to suck more money out of players. Even worse gives 2K incentive to add in boring grinding pay walls that no one wants to play. VC is not cheap either if you want to start out fully upgraded expect to fork out another $50 dollars.  ",

It has various optiosn in game for creating things as well, but I haven't checked those out yet.  The My team feature iss pretty fun to play. In regular season mode you can add a custom team logo/uniform/stadium (like the Sonics). I'm not sure if that team/others are available to add to a league though, but there is a roster editor in game.",

            "review_text": "NBA 2K17, I clocked 250+ hours into this game so I think its time for a review of this game.  Singleplayer:   Playnow: What can I say about it nothing new, blacktop is great if you play a player they dont have their jerseys, you have a crowd. And the place its set up is actually awesome.  Mycareer: Mycareer changed alot it now features Archetypes (NBA 2K17 biggest and only feature) It looked good at the trailer but I actually realised thats its bad real bad. Lets say I want to be glasscleaner eating boards, but I also want to shoot - NOPE you can't do that you cant be Demarcus Cousins or any of the great NBA centers/powerforwards. Cause I'm sure there are Shooting centers that grab rebounds, but 2K placed a cap on this so you cant shoot very well. Oh yeah, myplayer still sounds black, for the people that have problems with it, its perfectly fine for me. The Myplayer creation ugh, its AWFUL nothing new! No new haircuts but THEY gave the NBA players their good haircuts lets say Jimmy Butler, he got his haircut really good at this game but they dont have an option for us to wear it.  The Story is good, why good you say? Cause its better then 2K16's.   MyLeague/MyGM: This was the gamemode where I didnt find any bugs/glitches, MyGM and Myleague(Online) is still there you also have ''Start Today'' where you play as your favourite NBA team and start where the team left off with all real NBA stats, standings and injuries. you also have ''Season'' where you just play one season and ''playoff) where you play in the playoffs. They also have this new thing called ''League Expansion'' with that you can start the league with the 30 current NBA teams and have 6 extra teams! (Awesome), You can then create your own team or use a pre-built team or Download it. Myleague is just great no problems.  ONLINE: MyPark: Its just like 2K16 good or bad? ITS BAD, there are hackers, Glasscleaners that can shoot 3's. Rookies with all the mypark badges and 99. The worst thing is Mypark is the same the PARKS are the same except Rivet city but that just went ugly. They dont have voicechat which is good thing or bad thing you may choose. I'm not even talking about park anymore. NEXT! let me say one more thing its capped at 60 fps!  ProAm: Its cool, no hackers found yet and there are actually people in it, its still hard to find but better then 2k16.  MyTeam: Packluck is alot better then 2k16 you get better card wayyy better.  Playnow Online: I wanted to try it once but after 5 minutes searching for a player, I gave up. I'll update this when I actually played it.  GAMEPLAY:  Gameplay is really smooth, alot smoother then 2K16 you cant spam skillmoves anymore cause your player will get tired you actually control the skillmoves and its now not who can spam its now who can control the sticks better. I thought they fixed that double team glitch but its still there anyone tell me?  Graphics: Graphics are amazing a huge improvement from 2K16 I also see the emotion from players. I play this at Ultra settings and it looks amazing definitely a + for them. It runs buttery smooth.  But this is really annoying, This is grindgame a VC/attribute grind game. MYCAREER is so grindy its really annoying it took forever to upgrade my playmaker and they actually force you to buy VC cause grinding on MYCAREER is to annoying but yeah its 2K.  And this is my review: Score: 8/10 fix the damn game 2K. Should YOU get it? For this price now wait for now, when its on sale for like 30 bucks or sumthing.  But I do recommend it. ",

            "review_text": "I absolutely regret buying this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game. It has literally no improvements from last year, the dominance of 2k, however, continues.  Pros: -It's a basketball game  Cons: -Stupid extra animation that makes defender block ur shot every single time - The defence of AI is too good, unless u make a play , u can't do anything. Even when u are Isiah Thomas against Javale Mcgee, u still can't get pass him.Which in reality is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Literally every pg can blowby a center -When u get too close and run u will just call for a charge. Have u seen LeBron draw a charge at mid court? Impossible, I didn't even push him during the animation and I was called for a charge. -shot meter is garbage when the games want u to get green u get green when the game doesn't want to u to get green release u won't get green release - the story force u to be an american I know the majority of the players are American but still, c'mon man! - Paid to win. The time to get high overall rating to to high -Help defence is stupid  -Justice Young is too overpowered u can't win against him in practice.  -Why does the coach have to call a time out everytime I was subbed in  -Practice takes to long to progress. -Unskipable cut scence and the 5 min long opening scene -The accessories and shoes is too ♥♥♥♥ing expensive - The passing system is garbage and should be redo -The teamate grade is so ♥♥♥♥. I got minus a grade for a TO and 1/4 of grade for an assist?WTF  Overall , this is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game. The only reason I'm still playing this is becasuse there's no other basketball game out there. I really hope EA bring back a good NBA live so that there will be competition. Everytime I play this game I go full on rage mode. I don't suggest anyone buying this game as the patch won't fix most of the issue. The gameplay is definitely lack luster and is so different from real life. Please do not buy this game unless u have too much money or desperate for a basketball game. I would like to refund this game but I only know how bad the game was after 2 hours. But the steam refund only avaliable in 2 hours so I coudn't refund this crap. Hope my review could help u guys. (I seriously rather playing 2k12 or 13 the gameplay were wayyy better, next-gen just add more ♥♥♥♥ animation which is useless at improving the game)",

            "review_text": "I would say that I have decidedly mixed feelings about this game. There are times when it's a lot of fun, but those moments are, ultimately, overshadowed by the game's more frustrating aspects.   The Good:   The game's franchise mode, 'MyGM,' has a lot of depth to it, and compares favorably with the franchise modes in most other sports games.    Within MyGM, there are a lot of options for different ways to simulate games, including several that allow you to partially sim a game, jumping in and out of the action as needed. This is something that is overlooked in a lot of other sports games, and it goes a long way towards making it possible to actually get a lot out of the franchise mode without having to put in more time than you really want to.    The graphics are very good, though that comes with the significant caveat that even on very high-end computers, the framerate becomes unacceptable unless you turn the graphics settings way down. But even on the lower graphics settings that you end up playing on, the game still looks great.   The coaching options within games are great. I love the ability to give my team instructions during timeouts and it doesn't take very long to get used to navigating the different coaching menus that are available during the game, during timeouts, and when you pause the game.    Having a bunch of classic NBA teams, as well as international clubs, is a really nice touch.    The 'rubberbanding' seems to have been significantly reduced this year, if not elimated altogether. This was probably single biggest improvement the game needed to make, so I'll definitely give props to the devs for that!   The presentation is very good. The menus look good and are easy to navigate, load times are quick, and the soundtrack is excellent. Areas for improvement: 1) the lineup annoucements at the start of the game feel very stiff and robotic. Each name, position, etc. is read off in exactly the same way, with the same intonation, spacing, volume... even the crowd's cheering is the exact same for every player. 2) While the soundtrack is, again, excellent, the over-the-top censoring of the lyrics is super annoying. Either choose songs that aren't explicit, or don't censor them. Cutting out every other word of a song (including words like 'thugs', 'steal', and 'E') is just obnoxious.    The Bad:   Too many actions are mapped to the same controller input, or an input similar enough that you're likely to do the wrong one by mistake. The game relies heavy on contextual actions, with the computer deciding what it thinks you meant to do based on the situation. Unfortunately, artificial intelligence isn't yet where it needs to be in order for this sort of system to work smoothly. It works pretty well most of the time, but there are reasonably frequent instances of 'I wanted to do a layup, not a jumper!', or 'I wanted to do a hesitation dribble, not a shot!', etc.   No option to turn off the pregame show, halftime show, or--most annoyingly--the in-game infographics. Sometimes the game will be interrupted for 20 seconds while they show a stupid pie chart with some stat I don't care about, and I have to wait for it to go away before I can continue playing the game.    The shameless advertisements for Gatorade. 'You know, Kenny, one really underrated advantage to timeouts is that it gives the players a chance to get some Gatorade. It's so important to stay hydrated, and these players aren't going to play as well late in the game if they don't take the time to replenish their electrolytes during the timeout. They need to refuel with Gatorade in order to play their best.' 'I couldn't agree more.'   The commentary. It's not necessarily worse than other sports games, but the gaming industry as a whole just hasn't made the kind of investment into good commentary that it needs to. One specific shortcoming is that the commentary seems to be triggered by the outcome of a play, rather than how it actually went down. A player might shoot a ridiculous falling-out-of-bounds three-pointer just over the fingertips of the defender, and they'll say 'How could they leave him so wide-open?! That's just lazy defending.' But if a wide-open shot is missed, they might say 'great defending on that play! they made sure to get a hand in his face and force a bad shot.'   The game is heavily lacking in the realm of instructions. There are a lot of game mechanics--including even the controls themselves--that aren't explained in enough detail, or aren't explained at all. I've had to do way too much googling to try and figure out how different parts of this game work--and in many cases, I haven't been able to find an answer at all.    The Ugly:   The coins/microtransactions system seems to pervade every inch of the game, and it feels like every design decision was made with the microtransactions system in mind. For example, in MyGM, there's no ability to save your game or load an old save. The game autosaves frequently, and that's the only save you can use. I even tried copying off the save file (in my filesystem, outside of the game) and loading it back in later (without modifying it at all), only to have the game throw an error that the file was 'invalid' or 'corrupted' or something like that. Presumably, this is to stop people from somehow exploiting saves to get coins, or something stupid like that. But as someone who couldn't care less about the stupid coins, it's just annoying. If I want to reload my save if I lose a game, I should be able to--it's my freaking game.   Similarly, there's no ability to turn off injuries once you've started a franchise. So, you can be 10 years into your franchise and decide that you're tired of dealing with player injuries, and your only choice would be to start over from scratch, with injuries turned off. Again, this is presumably to stop people from turning off injuries instead of paying coins to heal their players.   Every mode of the game is completely oriented around the coins system. In the MyGM mode, for example, you spend coins to improve your franchise, to keep your players happy, to scout opposing teams, to keep your players healthy, to improve your chances of signing players, to improve team chemistry, and so on.    Passing. The passing is absolutely, inexcusably terrible. It's beyond frustrating, and you'll find yourself passing to the wrong person more often than not. And for those people who counter by saying 'you should use icon passing,' the fact is that icon passing is too slow, not an option in many cases (like when you're already in mid-air), and not a good excuse for the lack of basic functionality. The fact is that they've dedicated three buttons on the controller just to basic passing (not even counting icon passing, or the double-press or long-press inputs)--and none of them work well enough. The passing controls in this game sound fancy and elaborate, but that doesn't mean a thing if you can't quickly and reliably choose which player to pass to.    No physics system, or a very bare-bones physics system. The game does not appear to utilize a physics system. Instead, the game seems to rely on preset actions and animations. For example, you can lliterally run circles around a ballhandler while they stand still at the top of the key, dribbling, and it is not possible to run into the ball or knock it away. The only way to steal the ball is to press the input for 'steal', at which point the game will do some calculation to determine whether you knock the ball away, commit a foul, or just swipe and miss.    No out-of-bounds forcefield. Players will happily sprint headlong out of bounds, which is a problem because staying in bounds ends up demanding a level of precision that we simply don't have with our combination of controller + camera angle. As a result, baseline drives are all-but-nonexistant.   ",

            "review_text": "So this is a pre-release review with every intention of a follow up. For the most part it is a negative review.  Cons: 1) PC Disadvantage: -Pre-Release content. I heard that consoles were able to get the game a week in advance with just high school content. This enabled players to build the character up prior to the actual game. Unfortunately PC players didn’t get that option. Also Iv read that some people haven’t gotten any bonuses. -Graphics. Because the PC version is a port from the consoles, there is a big difference in performance. When playing on consoles, graphics are set; however when starting the graphics need to be tweaked. For those sporting a 1070+ graphics cards Iv read that they have been doing fine. I read a review where a person with a 970 sli was struggling. For majority of the people it is going to be like this: lower your graphics to get a faster gameplay, or increase your graphics to what you feel was acceptable by nba2k16 and experience a very laggy gameplay. I’m running a gtx970m, had no problems with the previous games on max settings but am struggling here. The voice acting in the cutscenes finish way ahead than the actual laggy video. 2) Initial Story: -How can the personality of the character be so arrogant and pompous with the level designated to him. Jeez even number 1 draft picks in the game are given like a 78 or 79. Also why can’t we skip initial cutscenes? Pros: 1) More options? -A lot more options are provided but I haven’t experienced them all. For instance, you can add 6 new teams into your mygm mode. Will add more with a follow up.  Neutral 1) Face Scan -Mix reviews about this. One would think that capturing a face scan on a cellphone would make things easier (because of the higher megapixels etc) but it is still challenging. Some people are able to get it with little effort while others struggle. Hence this feature is pretty neutral.  Will be waiting for an update/patch for the game to answer the graphical issues. It sucks because pre-ordering it gives people the opportunity to play the game 4 days in advance. This graphical issue negates that advantage because playing on lowered settings spoils the experience for the user, while they have to wait for a patch. Right of the the Bat: console versions definitely better option.   For the recommendation portion: If people pre-ordered this and got a discount on the price, then thats your advantage. However, if people paid full price with the option of playing earlier, then I don't recommend it. If you are like the majority where NBA 2k16 was running smoothly, there is a high chance it won't for the inital part of the game till after an update is released (which may come in a week or 2). ",

If you played 2K16, you know what's up and don't let any of these reviews here convince you otherwise.  Because it is still the long process it always was - and in my opinion, as far as mycareer goes at least, I'm pulling Draymon Green-ish stats in games with only a 59 overall. I certainly wasn't doing that in the last 2K with stats that low; at least not consistently. So honestly, the low stats don't SEEM as hindering as the previous installment.  The gameplay is solid, overall it still feels very similar to 2K16. I have noticed ripping the ball is way easier than before - and I'm playing as power forward. So that's saying something.

He's a smaller one now. - Your twin sister is gone. You're not forced to be black if you aren't. - Your business partner ain't the stereotypical money loving d!ck.

Still missing them wide open layups though. - No more Spike Lee. - No more Spike Lee. - No more Spike Lee. - And finally: No more Spike Lee.  Cons - Performance jitters here and there. Hopefully they get fixed. - MyCareer 'MyCourt' takes too much time going through useless animations like walking through doors. WE GET IT. HE'S NOT A HOBO AND LIVE INDOORS. - Practice is mandatory and each has 3 drills. The upgrades takes at least 3x as long to get now with the must-do-drills system. - Instead of an annoying Vic that you were happy when he 'disappeared', you get 2 nonsensical sidekicks that are playing alongside with you. - Way too similar to 2k16. Not much new aside from a attribute system that is a hybrid of past systems. - Cutscenes are glitched. The movie is fastforwarded while the sounds are played in normal speeds. Still good if you're like me and don't want to cringe that much. - The face scanning is buggy and can't identify me. I'm Asian so maybe my eyes aren't getting captured?",

Solution: make sure your graphcis card is on. desktops use dedictaed graphics all the time, laptops don't (to conserve battery). nvidia didn't update the drivers yet for this game, so i had to go into the nvidia control panel and enable this game manually. still not 100%, as it would be better if the drivers updated, but wow what a difference.

So while every other NBA team picks up a 70+ player (some are higher), the Denver Nuggets decided to pick this white guy with an average rating of 55. And with hard work and no (real) money spent, thanks to 'Doin' the work' and generous VC gifts from ingame sponsors and becoming a better player, I am, after 22 hours played, already a 74 average player. And the growth continues. 'Doin' the work' is actually an uncomplicated system, also gives you minor improvements for free and allows you to raise the ten skill categories which you spend your VC on (besides Badges, clothes and stuff for your private court).  The story is actually not terrible. You team up with Justice Young (played by Michael B. Jordan) and form the dynamic duo 'Orange Juice', which actually sounds completly batshit insane in the beginning but it's not as horrible as being called 'Frequency Vibrations' in 2K16. It also unlocks a major feature of the game, the duo-controls which enables some great plays. You even get a voice that seems to match most ethnic groups you can choose from and the story is not horrible at all. Your mom only calls on the phone, your father is dead and so there is no major drama except for the stuff that happens in the team or if you decide to skip on (team) training. No Spike Lee is also a major improvement.  Technically the game runs flawless for me except for some black players sometimes losing their arms in the middle of the game. If somebody could explain to me now why my player always has to walk so many ways to leave places I would be really happy. Did nobody test the game before and figured out it's beyond annoying?",

They tend to move in ways that you can create offense in very fluid and dynamic ways. Its beatiful to watch and very rewarding once you learn how to execute plays and create within the offense. I can make gameplay complaints. Like how it feels impossible to get an offensive rebound even when you have your opponent boxed out. But its all minor complaints and no sports game is perfect. The fact of the matter is that 2K17 is the best basketball game to date.   Not just in terms of gameplay but variety as well. I bought 2K17 with full intentions of MyCareer being the mode I spent my time with. Ive yet to even touch it. So far Ive spent all my time with MyTeam which is rediculously addictive. Just within that mode alone theres so much variety of stuff that you can do. The fact that Ive played this game for 69 hours so far and I still havent even played MyCareer, MyGm (which Ive always loved in this series) or PRO-AM, speaks to the unrivaled variety and value this game offers.   It even runs great. I didnt buy the game at launch so I dont know how that went. But right now the game is running great and its never once crashed on me. Ive only played a few online matches in MyTeam so far but they were lag free. How the game ran online was a big worry for me, but its been great so far.  I was originally going to try everything before I wrote a review, but I see now thats going to be hundreds of gameplay hours from now. Take it from someone who has been playing 2K since the original game on the Dreamcast. Back when Iverson was the only player you needed or wanted on the cover every year. If you love basketball, you want this game.",

Less responsive gameplay than 2k13 or 2k15.  Extended Review after 200+ hours of gameplay and numerous patches:  This game is still badly broken and by far the least fun I've had playing a 2K game. Gameplay issues that have plagued all previous titles - Bad help defence, constant terrible double teams, your character being stuck in cement and running in quicksand, teammates going out of their way to brick wall you, broken pass selection, teammates still allowing way too many rebounds etc. etc. are all features of this title once again.  They also made fouls and turnovers even more frequent. As usual, fouls in the paint are a given, but add to that virtually every steal attempt and more regular fouls on jumpshots. Meanwhile the AI can strip you at will without even a steal animation.  Onto the bugs that have destroyed the game thanks in part to the stupid archetypes that severely limit the kind of character you can create.  My first character was a shot creator PG pre-patches. I played the full 82 game season and abandoned the character, the first character I've even given up on because the shot timing and badges were/still are bugged made every shot an F other than open dunks.  My second was a Glass Cleaner C and after some patches were finally released, it was fun for a little while, minus all the frustrations listed above from previous versions. But after unlocking almost all of the badges and winning a championship, I was ready to go back to a guard role.  Thinking that maybe the game would be fixed by now, I created a Slasher SG and was going okay until unlocking the badge Relentless Finisher, which started bugged, was fixed, and is bugged again. Every layup is an F and will miss.  Welcome back to Free Throw Simulator 2k17..  3 characters, 2 abandoned. 2K have already released multiple patches and hotfixes and I doubt they will continue much longer. The game is unfortunately broken trash.",

In earlier titles of the series, I was seriously daunted by the controllable controls and gave up shortly after playing through a demo or two. This time, I actually persevered. So a thumb up to myself :). alright, to the game review. Generally, the game has a rather steep learning curve, with tutorial of 2ku not giving much in term of a coherent tutorial. However, after getting the hang of the controls and getting through a few shameful displays in the court, I can appreciate the charm of this game and the endless possibilities. I would seriously recommend this game. A number of points of cons though, so if you mind these, please dun buy: 1) Long cutscenes that can't be skipped in MC mode. After a few new profiles and careers, these cutscenes really become the number one headache. The only plus is I actually get to do some reading while waiting for the endless calls to mum. 2) The online currency. I can appreciate using online currency to buy animations, uniforms and sorts but to use the currency to upgrade stats of your character is really upsetting. This is especially so because you can actually buy these currency with real money. Not very (poor) user friendly. This also makes upgrading your character an awkward choice because attributes increase will not overlap to a new character so that's like money wasted when you start a new game. 3) Animation slow. I'm not referring to the slick animation in court. I'm referring to the slow and unskippable animation in between scenes. For example, when you return to your (i don't know how you call that) lobby with your bag. You have to literally see your character open the door, walk in slow motion to a particular spot. That's like what 10 seconds every time you complete a event. Totally unbearable.  Other from the above mentioned abhorable parts, the game is awesome. Really hope NBA2K17 would improve on these in future patches, at least and especially the unskippable cutscenes.",

Rebounding is now something that feels like a skill that a coin flip. I like it a lot.  That out of the way; I hate games that require you to be online to access single player features. I don't buy this game to play online so I don't see a need to be forced to be online. The MyPlayer is intriguing but extremely annoying as I can't access it without creating a new file and starting over. I also REALLY hate how the Virtual Currency system is tied to online servers and makes you have to grind to get upgrades. That's all nothing new but it's really annoying to me and I feel like the developers are forcing players to partake it spending excessive time on the cell phone app and doing the same boring drills over and over again (or just ♥♥♥♥ away a ton of actual money for VC - I think not!). The MyPlayer skill caps are another annoying feature that force you into an archetype and take away from the player being able to choose what they want to be good at. You can't be a great dunker and 3-point shooter. Why not??? Not to mention that there is no way to be a decent player in MyPlayer the first time around unless you grind doing other things for a while and save your VC. I never like the idea that you have to be a scub starting out in the NBA. It would be nice if there was at least some sort of randomizer that allowed you to have more points to work with so there was a chance you could start out faily decent. The face capture is pretty bad too but at least it's there for PC this year.  The music they used in the game is awful too. Typical auto-tune pop garbage by dudes in skinny jeans but at least that can be turned off.  7/10 for me. Good basketball with annoying features.

            "review_text": "---------------- PLEASE READ ----------------  First off, if you are fan of Kuroko no Basket stop reading this review and buy the game immediately.  Otherwise:  Pros:  &gt; Great Gameplay - Even more fluid than past iterations, with more animations and potential plays making more more organic looking basketball.  &gt; Lots of Teams - In addition to the 30 current NBA teams, 2k17 also offers a selection of european sides and some of the greatest teams of years past such as the '95-'96 Chicago Bulls and the 2000-'01 Philadelphia 76ers. This gives the roster some much appreciated depth allowing you to assemble dream teams of the best players of all time.  &gt; Custom Rosters - 2k offer 2 initial rosters to use: the official 2k roster (up-to-date NBA roster) and an injury free roster. But where 2k17 really shines is in its offering of community created custom rosters, such as an All Star roster (the greatest lineup for of all time for each team), a roster where Kobe isn't retired and a Kuroko no Basket roster (Where the 76ers have the generation of miracles and kagami).  &gt; Blacktop - Play streetball ranging from 1v1 to 5v5, half-court or full-court. A nice addition which varies the gameplay a little as it feels and plays like the real thing putting emphasis on dribble moves and attacking the paint rather than the perimeter.  &gt; MyGM - Exactly what you would hope for from a GM mode in a sports game, nothing to seperate it from the pack but equally nothing really wrong with it either.  &gt; MyTeam - Whilst not my prefered mode this mode is akin to Fifa's Ultimate Team and allows you to build your dream NBA sides by collecting player cards, but as to expect from any mode of this nature it is full of necessary consumables and requires you spend money on packs to get a half-decent side. But as far as an Ultimate Team-esque mode goes, MyTeam does just fine.  &gt; Soundtrack: A combination of hip-hop and trap music which suites the action of the game well and is varied enough as to not become stale.  Cons:  &gt; MyCareer - MyCareer fails to deliver, with nothing but long un-skippable cutscenes and grindy and monotonous gameplay to entice you into buying VC via microtransactions. Don't even consider heading online to MyPark or the ProAM without a fully maxed out MyPlayer as you will just be stomped by those who have either played the game for hours upon hours or paid real money in return for stats. This is a greedy move on 2k's part and has ruined a mode which otherwise had the potential to be truly special. This pay-to-win RPG model works fine in a free-to-play game like Freestyle2: Street Basketball- but in a fully priced AAA release is frankly disgusting and puts a real downer on the whole experience.  &gt; Player Base - The PC player base for 2k17 is small to begin with and is highly concentrated in the MyPark and ProAM modes, so if you wish to play MyTeam or exhibition matches online buy the game on console.  In Conclusion:  If what you are looking for is a fun basketball game to play offline exhibition matches and MyGM then this is a definite buy.  However if you are looking for a fufilling career mode or to play online then I recommend that you look elsewhere as this game is pay to win and you will struggle to find a game in the online modes.  TL;DR If you want to play offline then definitely buy this, if you want to play online then I recommend that you give this one a miss.",

I personally think everything has been better in this game then any other 2k game. I am looking forward to what 2k will make in the future and I will most likely buy NBA2k18",
