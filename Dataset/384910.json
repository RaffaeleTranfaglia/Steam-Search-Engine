            "review_text": "This is an adventure game in the style of Sierra Online's original 'Quest' titles, like King's Quest, Space Quest and Police Quest. No previous knowledge of prior 'Last Half of Darkness' games is required to play or to understand the storyline. In order to find and save your girlfriend from a dark cult, you explore various fixed-camera scenes in a seedy town for clues. I found the puzzles fun and solving them was great satisfaction for a player who is normally stumped on games like this with without a walkthrough. The most difficult aspect for me was finding all the objects that are needed as tools in other locations. Be sure to search every nook and cranny for usable items.  This steam package also includes a free copy of Tomb of Zojir and 3 other games. Tomb of Zojir is a 'must play' for fans of the genre and is worth the price of admission alone!",
