The mouse isn't locked when you play so I found myself ramping up the sensitivity just to keep the mouse from wandering on to my seccond screen and clicking things. This game does have potential.",

BOTs can shoot players in a distance that is not quite suitable for games and the hit rate is quite high. (but players cannot shoot behind the walls) So I guess I would say there are programming problems in this game.  When I check the game developer, this is the only game published on Steam? Is it for marketing giveaway? I'm just asking.",

            "review_text": "Hi,  Right of the bat let me just say the latest version is way more improved than what I played some weeks ago. While by no means perfect, this shows the dedication of the person behind it, so kudos for that, this is what warrants a positive review in my book.  Some very noticeable improvements: - Movement and Control: Way better, now I can control the character and expect it to behave as it should most of the time; also, much easier and natural to replenish ammo now :) - UI: Looks much cooler, but more importantly now you can easily see what's going on, much easier to read (health, ammo etc.) - Optimization: Almost no framerate drops now, the game is much more stable than before - The intro/story screens are something else now, I can't even describe the difference (though this is a minor point for most) - The new lightning in the levels really bring the whole game to life (although you are mostly surrounded by metal and robots)  In conclusion, the price seems rather fair now comparing to what you get... there is still room for more improvements and tweaks, but if the latest experience shows anything is that work on the game continues and we can expect more updates in the future.  Tip: Mouse can be erratic at first, make sure to adjust sensitivity from the options menu... this is almost a prerequisite here unlike most games, but by no means a deal breaker once you find a setting confortable for you.",
