            "review_text": "When I first heard about Prospekt I was pretty excited. Finally, what could be considered a new game in the Half-Life series! Greenlit by Valve themselves and considered to be a sequel to Opposing force! I’ve always been an advocate for paid mods. Some people pour their heart and soul into a mod, and I have no problem with them being paid for that hard work. But with Prospekt, I honestly can't say its worth the price tag.  Where do I begin?  Firstly Il start with the positives. This game looks, and sounds amazing. The environments look incredibly detailed, and work well with the overall atmosphere. I especially like the Combine areas which I honestly think look better than some of the Combine areas in Half-Life 2. The voice acting is also pretty good, which is a rarity with community made mods for Half-Life games. It’s clear to me that the developer knows how to create some beautiful looking environments in the Source Engine.  Unfortunately when we look at the overall level design, this game is pretty poor. I have three major complaints about this game. Firstly, it’s incredibly boring. Pretty much the entire game is just run through corridors and rooms shooting combine. That’s it. I have seen a few people saying that 'Well isn't that what Half-Life is anyway?' not really. If you look at Half-Life 2, it has a variety of enemies, environments and different situations that the player has to progress through. Even Half-Life 1 had a more varied cast of enemies which all fought differently. for pretty much 90% of this game you're just shooting combine with the same weapons, in the same situations, in the same poorly designed levels. Which brings me to my next complaint.  The levels are horribly designed. They look pretty don’t get me wrong, but they are so poorly thought out. Most of the firefights are done in big spacious rooms with little to no cover at all. The tactic I had to employ with pretty much every fight was either, fire at will and just hope I kill all the enemies before they pump me with too many bullets, or wait around the corner to bottleneck them into coming at me single file. Which leads me onto the final big issue with Prospekt.  The combine AI. One of the impressive parts of the combine soldiers in Half-Life 2 was how they worked in battle. They would use cover effectively and take turns to pop out and shoot the player. They would try to nudge you out of cover with grenades, and generally worked together as a squad. The combine in Prospekt however, instead decide to just charge straight at you, all guns blazing until either you or they are dead. This leads to some very silly fights where I use my previously mentioned “Bottleneck” tactic where one combine walks around the corner, and gets killed with my shotgun. Then the next soldier walks around the corner and gets a shell to the head as well. So does the next, and the next, and the next, and none of them seem to question “Hmm I wonder if he’s waiting round there to kill us? Maybe we should try a different tactic?” To be honest there isn’t much more you can really do with the combine in these environments. Theres practically no cover for them to utilise and sometimes theres just so many combine piled into one room that they might as well just charge straight at you.  There are a few other niggles I have with the game as well. There are several flashback sequences that happen throughout the game, where we hear some of Adrian’s past in the military. These begin to happen less as the game goes on but, to be honest there doesn’t seem to be much point to them other than at the beginning.  Another gripe I have is that for some reason the developer has changed the skin for the shotgun combine soldier to look either the same or very similar to the regular combine soldier. Half-Life 2 originally had both types of combine look the same, but Valve eventually changed the shotgun wielding ones to have red eyes and wear a slightly different looking uniform. That was done so that the player could differentiate between the different types of soldiers, as the shotgun ones can deal quite a lot of damage. Which makes me wonder why the developer has decided to reverse this decision for what seems like no reason.  The final thing I want to talk about is the final battle. If you don’t want any spoilers then feel free to skip next few paragraphs. The final battle had me so lost and frustrated I had to resort to using god mode and noclip. The whole premise is that you have to overload this reactor thing. I’m not sure what it was exactly because the game didn’t really make it clear to me what it actually was. And to be honest it didn’t really make it clear what I was supposed to do either. There are four buttons spaced out around the core and you have to press all of them to overload it. However combine soldiers begin to flood in and they will try to press the buttons again and turn them back on.  The problem I have with this segment is that, I’m not exactly sure whether I am doing it correctly. I press all of the buttons down and the screen flashes white about 50 times blinding me, but I’m not sure whether the combine have unpressed one yet or not. It seems that when they do, they don’t unpress immediately. They seem to take a few seconds which in that time you can’t go and press it down, until the lights have gone green again. I’m also not sure if you have to keep the combine from unpressing them for a few seconds afterwards, or whether you just have to press all the buttons at once and that’s it. Basically the game didn’t really communicate what I was supposed to be doing very well.  The other issue with the final battle is how ridiculously difficult it is. As the battle goes on, more and more combine flood into the reactor and it eventually gets to a point where theres just too many to fight off. It doesn’t help that there is pretty much no cover at all, and the narrow platforms you have to walk across to get to each button have no hand railings, so one false move and you fall to your death. And the screen flashing white every few seconds doesn’t help either.  In conclusion, Prospekt is not worth the money. I have played much better community mods than this that are free. It makes me start to wonder what Valve is doing with the Half-Life licence because honestly, this is not the kind of game that they should be giving that licence to. Any developer from Valve could see that this game has some serious design issues, but then again considering Steam’s awful lack of quality control, I wouldn’t be too surprised if the only thing Valve looked at in this were the visuals. It just worries me that Steam’s zero quality control is now spilling into Valve’s own licences. Especially Half-Life. I understand that this is developed by one man, and to be honest, he’s done a good job with what he’s clearly good at. Environments. The visuals in this game actually rival Half-Life 2 in a lot of ways. But I think this game would have been considerably better if there was another person on the team who was good with level design, as that seems to be this game’s main flawl. Overall, I cannot recommend.",

            "review_text": "Hope you like shooting Combines with the SMG from HL2, because thats like 95% of this game. The other 5% is running out of ammo, and pushing buttons.  Aside from some off-color narration (literally), this game has very little to do with Opposing Force. Instead, it focuses entirely on the Combines from HL2. The level design follows the same logic (Hope you like the color Grey!) -Although, you get to see Xen for about 30 seconds. Gameplay is VERY repetative, difficult, and directives are flat-out unclear sometimes. In fact, the only way to know that you missed some button or exit is when you realize the Combines wont stop spawning.   I REALLY wanted to like this game...but I honestly had to 'Impulse 101' and godmode my way through the last 25% of it, just to see the End, because it became so god damn tedious and repetative.",

No, this game has no like no plot at all. Fairly simple puzzles and alot of what feel like grind battles. There is no a single other character in the game you actually see..you do hear a few soldiers talking in flash backs...but you never team up with or even talk to anyone which for me is one of the things that make Half-life great.  There is no Opposing force weapons and it lacks most of the Half Life 2 special weapons...you get the basics..shotgun, AR, submachine gun...but no grab gun or portal gun...or any alien weapons. The Opposing force weapons like Sniper rifle and Light machine gun do not feature. You may have heard there is a trip to Xen well that's true but it lasts like 2 minutes and features none of the mobs you fought there before.  In short...for one person it's not a bad feature at all...but he really needed to team up with a few other people to add the depth needed to charge money for.

The high point of the entire thing, what this seems to be marketed on, is the return to Xen - but don't expect anything but Combine soldiers, or more than a single map that has you flip a couple of switches to return immediately to Earth's vicinity (okay, it's a space station - and it looks -exactly- like the location you left moments ago). Unsurprisingly, it is filled with - you guessed it - Combine soldiers.

You ocassionaly run into zombines and headcrabs, etc, but it's mostly troop-to-troop combat in the HL universe (the all-too brief trip through Xen was a nice touch). The maps are really, really nice, the action is good, and it's basically more HL2 action... just want many of us want. WELL worth the few bucks for the game.

            "review_text": "NOTE - THIS REVIEW WAS WRITTEN ON THE PRE-SUMMERSALE PATCH   Non-spoiler review - Very combat based, very Challenging, but the story telling and level design more than made up for the extra challenge.  It is more than worth the £3.75 that it is currently at during this sale. If you think you would ever like a bit more Half-Life, I would definitely urge you to but this as it is extremly cheap right now.   NOTE - THIS REVIEW INCLUDES SPOILERS! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.   Ok, So let's break down my experience of Prospekt  -&gt;Went in thinkining 'Oh, it's a Half-Life 2 Addon, probably won't be much fun.' Oh Boy was I wrong. If you enjoyed the sequenced combat in Half-Life 2, You'll love this!  Though that's where the similarities of the games begin to differ.  I would attempt to make some more comparisons between the games, but that is vastly unfair. First of all, Half-Life 2 was developed by a team of developers. Prospekt was developed by just one. Which is still a giant feat, considering the length of this game matches the length of the Half-Life 2: Episodes.  Pros - New Levels - The levels were extremly refreshing. While the maps theme remained true to Half-Life 2, the maps themselves were new and very well made.  Story - While the game lacked much of a story, the game told the story of Sheppard before the events of Half-Life: Opposing Force. This introduced a new way of story telling, and while the story is very predictable (and that's only because most of us know how Opposing Force went) the other way of story telling was still a breath of fresh air. The story also matches the players progress, as the player progresses furthur towards the end of the game the story gets closer to Sheppard's deployment, and this is a great way of tellingt a story.  Challenge - If you enjoy taking a challenge and fighting long battles only to be swarmed with more guards, this is definitely the game for you. I personally felt like the combat in Half-Life 2 was easy, whereas this takes combat to a whole new level.  Developer - The Developer himself agreed that it had a very rocky beginning. He understands that he made mistakes. And so, he's working on this game still. Rectifying some of the mistakes.   Cons- Level Design - The levels seemed really bare. There were very few props in the levels, which meant that the levels just didn't feel very alive. I think if there was a bit more decor/props in some of the levels where you do nothing, (All Seeing Eye) The player would have more to do than wait for guards to arrive.  The journey of Sheppard through this game didn't feel very well put together, I thought that there was a fair few teleporters than neccessary, and while sure, going from Nova Prospekt to a space station would probably require a teleporter, I felt that there was far too many teleporters and it just felt like a cheap way of introducing a new environment.  Two chapters in a row had the exact same layout, (Go to one place, press a button, Do combat, go to other place, press a button, do combat, move to exit.) These were two consecutive chapters and it felt like the same scene done twitce.  Story - The game didn't have much of a story, while the flashbacks had their own play, it didn't really make up for lack of story that the game had. I didn't feel like I was following a story, I felt like I was just guided in a direction. Which if this was under the idea that GMan is just guiding Sheppard in the corect direction, it was carried out pretty well. GMan, I don't really know if he was a good addition. While all Half-Life games have sightings of GMan, he just felt out of place. If GMan is guiding Freeman, then he shouldn't require help in Nova Prospekt. His sightings in Prospekt were mere jumpscares and I don't think that G-man would just appear for a split second and then dissapears, it makes no senes other to spook the player.  Also I felt than the reason Sheppard was placed wasn't a very good reason. He was put in Nova Prospekt to find and help Freeman but never actually sees Freeman. Though I notice that one of the maps is almost completely the same as prison_08 in Half-Life 2, (The map where Alyx and Freeman teleport to Kleiners lab before the uprising) So maybe this is a case of He just missed Freeman, like in Opposing Force had a similar scene. If this is of the same, then this is a really good reference.   Very combat heavy - As much as i enjoyed the challenge, I found that I kept dying, the combat levels in All Seeing Eye, as an example, were very unforgiving if you didn't have much health. Of course, a challenge is expected, though I found that even on the easy difficulty I struggled.   I may have missed a few things. But heres a summary Clever way of story telling, but extremely combat heavy and challening. I would urge anybody who wants more Half-Life to buy this game.#   Edit:   I have just played the game with the newer patch, And boy does it look SEXY! The graphical overhaul is just beautiful! Some of the previous issues i had with lack of decor and props were mostly gone. However toward the later game i didn't see much more similarity.   I really liked that Combine Power Co has a new twitst with some Hunter Fights!!!",

Maybe not the full 10€ (it is VERY short...) but it is on discount often, and 5€ is not too much. A few pros and cons:  + The story is not too complex but told OK. Nice idea with the marine background used as narration. + Level design is mostly beautiful. A bit repetitive but still good. + New voice and music is refreshing.  - Too many unnecessary details that distract you from your actual goal. The charme of the HL series is to give you exactly the right level of detail to guide you through the levels without noticing too much. In Prospekt you feel the designer wanted to let things look 'realistic', sacrificing this core principle.  - It confronts you with 'puzzles' (e.g. steam that does not kill you but prevents you from going on) but does not help you to solve those. You run around and - if you are lucky - run into what the developer had in mind for you to do. Which is often not the obvious thing. - As usual: too short :)",

Much like Half Life 2 I never ran out of ammo completely and the new addition of extra ammunition in the AR2 and the Shotgun was just amazing, The are some parts that do represent a Challange specially the Final Boss area and the Section with the Window to the Outer Space, Xen is indeed present and it looks wonderful, however the area is very short which was kinda of a dissapointment, however it wasnt the Creator's Fault but in fact Valve's Own fault for not adding any Xen Related Enemies in any Source Games so I do understand that there isnt point on making Xen much larger without any Alien Enemies.  To Be Honest I Think this Game is as good as a Game not made by Valve itself can be  9/10",

It is worth paying for, for the content that it provides(When on sale preferably) but it laks all the polish and great elements that made HL2 a iconic and great game.  I apreciate the effort and ideas put in to this but I actually feel that it is held back greatly by trying to be part of the HL2 world as very few of the enviroments suit HL2 limited weapon set and feel very barren and static without the need for Gravity gun ammo as also :spoiler: you never get the gravity gun; arguably the most core part of the HL2 gameplay experience.  And the final nail in the coffin is that while the game is super linear it never gives you any indication on where to go or what to do, meaning you will stumble around hitting the button to proceed without finding the place it opens first.

However what seemed novel and interesting in the begginging of the game quickly became boring and repetative. The shock reveals in the game did not do enough to take the story forward and the game on the whole lacked purpose and pace. The gameplay was significantly harder, and whilst I always enjoyed a challenge in the actual Half Life Games the challenge in this game was down to an increase in health for the protoss and being vastly outnumbered at all times, and no real change in tactics or units from the enemy.  I appreciate this was all done by one guy, and in some ways the maps were very impressive but I feel like I ended up paying money for his CV for a future job. The game had potential but by keeping the project to himself he lacked a bit direction, and I have to conclude that the game certainly isn't worth the money.",

            "review_text": "UPDATED REVIEW AT THE BOTTOM:  It looks to be quite good. I have played around 40 minutes so far and I think that most haf life fans will enjoy this game and quite a lot of other people will too. For one person to have made this it is quite an achievement.  It is NOT a mod- it is standalone and does not require Half Life 2  The first chapter is very atmospheric and eerie- it reminded me of the feeling I got playing Ravenholm in HL2 for the first time.  The second has a lot of combat. The combat is okay but on normal difficulty I found the marines hard to kill with the SMG especially when they often have mounted machine guns. In HL2 you kill Cps first and by the time you are mass killing marines you have lots of ammo.  The chapters were also quite dark and the flashbacks whilst interesting did sometimes get annoying.  Steam achievements might be a nice addition. Also the subtititles were either no always correct, didnt appear etc.  Overall it has potential and is well worth buying to support similar creations being brought to steam!  so far 7/10 :D  EDIT: I have almost finished the game- it has taken around two and a half hours which is not really comparable to HL2 Ep 2 like the dev said but I guess no one plays quite the same.  The next chapters got better. The combat was more enjoyable as I got further and ammo/health was given out more. The Xen level was great- I love jumping from one island to the next and it was nice to see Xen under combine control. I hope the dev will expand this level more in the future, include some of the xen creatures- there was only combine which is a slight disappointment, and perhaps feature the caves and bounce pads from xen we all loved in half life one.  The darkness hasn't got much better and I feel that certain areas of the game need brightening up. In contrast many need reducing in their blinding flashes. You may note that I said that I have only nearly finished the game as I am unable to beat the last level. That may just be my skil but I had to turn the difficulty down to easy and that didn't help. The light is blinding and most of the time you can see next to nothing. The screen is also shaking too much. A bit adds to the atmosphere but the dev has gone a little to overboard to the point where the last level is virtually unplayable. It is also made worse by the fact that there are TONS of combine and very little health.  It would also be nice to see in the future some of the unique opposing force weapons.  I really liked    The reveal that you were in space when you see the earth    however seeing as this game is called PROSPEKT about NOVA PROSPEKT we only get a little time in that prison. I thought the idea was that we were assisting freeman- I saw none of that! Perhaps if we could see freeman running around on computer screens and then we pressed a button and opened a door for him or diverted some combine to our position instead of his and took them out that would fit the idea of the game? As it is there is little story or defined objectives meaning you do not know what you are supposed to be doing other than that the freeman needs your help and you never seem to be helping him.  Apart from that I enjoyed the game quite a lot 6.5/10 :D  I will probably make a forum post where people could suggest things to the dev- for example I got glitched into a wall at one point causing death and sending my character back very far as I had not many saves.",

So any of you trying so hard to compare this to games like COD...go back to your couch and sit down.  With my nerd rage out of the way, on to the meat of this puppy. Playing as Shepard again after all these years was awesome. Not like Value was doing anyting with him anyway. Overall layout of the game was nice, however it did suffer a few problems. For starters, PTSD flash backs are a good way to tell a story, that is when there is a story to tell. At first I followed things quite well, but then things happened so fast...I was left wondering just what the hell was going on. Then there was the difficulty. Even on Normal...I was getting my butt kicked. But it wasn't too hard that I gave up. No...it generally ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off to the point of wanting to beat the game to prove a point. No game will beat me...lol I fully understand the limitations the creator was handed. So overall I'd say I loved it. If you are a Half-Life fan, I'd highly recommend it. Great challenge with some room to improve on things.",

Okay here is a nitpick so when I play this game I don't feel like Adrian Shepard I just feel like a dude in a H.E.V Suit and I know that it has so camo on it but it just doesn't feel like Adrian Shepard (you know the gloves and the no sleeves on the arms) 2. It's confusing where to go but its not like that other game *cough* Wilson Chronicles *cough* only two times it was confusing thats it. Well other than those 2 reasons this is really good go check it out (but be careful because the Combine are difficult) Anyways probably rate it 7/10.

But in the end you can't deny that it is a more than competent game, it looks good, it sounds good and it plays good. A lot of the hate, I think, came from a crowd of people who were dying to get some new Half Life material, this is a Valve approved game, but it wasn't made by Valve but it sure stirred people up and it seems like people were expecting it to be on par with Half Life 3 or something. But this was made by one man, not an entire team of people, and for just one guy this is a damn good game. One major positive I can give is the graphics, the dev must have really modified the engine to put out graphics that look as good as these! It really helps to give the game a kind of depressing mood, it makes the bright areas brighter and the dark areas darker which really improves the atmosphere.  Sure it has it's faults, but the dev listens and the most recent update has made the game much better than the initial variant. I do think that saying this has a 'rich story' is pushing it a little too far, the story is a little bare. I feel that this game gets a lot of undeserved hate because thay feel the need to stack it up against other games in the series, It's not a masterpiece but for a few hours it will keep you entertained with some challenging gameplay and some very interesting setpiece moments.",

I really loved the several big scale/large arena fight scenes with limited weapons. it forces you to be more creative and use quick reflexes.   I noticed some references to the first Half Life, some of the sounds were also form the first half life game. new textures, walls, floors, doors, that galaxy projections, and portals were pretty astounding.   no one can ever appreciate the storyline, everyone expects something; that's why i will not comment anything regarding the storyline. perhaps showing a sequence to 'how Shepard actually helped Gordon directly or indirectly' as the Gman asked of him. But still, this is a mod, and people going apesh*t to why didn't they pick up a pipe wrench instead of a crowbar is just plain dumb.   however, a constructive view at the con is the series of flashbacks. like, i get it, he keeps remembering stuff, but each cut lasts too long, and the fashy screen is just annoying. there's one scene where an army of combine shoot at you while you're still day-dreaming. lol. it was funny, but please don't do that mistake in your future games :P  Finally, my condolences to your nan who passed away fighting cancer in 2015 (as your credits stated); Kudos on the game, this does help sink in for the big HL3 wait. $10 well spent.

            "review_text": "Prospekt is a Valve approved sequel to the Half-Life: Opposing Force DLC. Unsurprisingly, it takes place in Nova Prospekt, presumably before or around the same time that Gordon Freeman gets their. One of the first things I noticed as I started playing the game was its graphics. They look noticeably better than the other Half-Life games, except Black Mesa of course, and as well as being a welcome improvement, they dont do anything to change that nostalgic feel of existing in the Half-Life universe (looking at you CM13), something which I really appreciate. Another thing that I am glad Richard Seabrook kept in this game is the way the story is presented. Just like every other Half-Life game, for the first 15 minutes or so of playing, you have nothing, and are required to get from A to B by using the surrounding environment, which I personally think is a great game mechanic, as it allows you to take in this games amazing atmosphere, as well as allowing new and old users of the source engine to get used to its controls and mechanics. Another thing I liked about this game was its music. While its certainly isn't to the standard of Kelly Bailey's amazing soundtracks, it definitely makes an epic firefight or nervous crawl through a vent that extra bit more special.  So after these first 15 minutes or so, the game soon turns into the nostalgic and classic FPS that we all know and love, (with a few puzzles here and there to mix up the gameplay), and reminds me of how LITTLE the gaming industry has come with not just FPS, but gaming as a whole since the Half-Life series.   Considering that this game was made completely by one person over the course of 18 months, I am genuinely astonished that Richard Seabrook has managed to make such a well polished game, and there was never a moment in this game where I felt it was tremendously lacking in any form of content. That being said, I managed to finish this game in just over 2 hours, which is far short of the 'Episode 1' length we were told, which (for me anyway) took almost 6 hours for me to complete the first time. I also found that the variety of gameplay did become lacking as I continued through the story, from Headcrabs, Barnacles, Zombies, Zombine, and Antlions, to just the Combine...yay. No awesome boss battles against Dropships, Gunships, Striders or Advisors. Whats even weirder is that you get an RPG a long way into the game, hyping up my anticipation that soon there would be an epic boss battle, but...no. I didnt even need to use it, as from the moment I picked it up the only enemies I would continue fighting for the rest of the game were, you guessed it, the Combine. Also, while the return to Xen in this game was certainly cool nostalgia-wise, once again the only enemies you are fighting their are the Combine, no Houndeye, Bullsquid, Alien Grunts, Alien Controllers, Gonarchs or Gargantuas, and you are literally their for 5 F*CKIN MINUTES.  Just incase you think I forgot, I know this game was only made by one person, and the amount of action packed fun, detail and nostalgia inducing atmosphere Richard Seabrook has managed to cram into this game over the course of 18 months is incredible, and for that I can definitely reccomend it to anyone. But... this IS a Half-Life game, so it should be reviewed like one, and in that regard it lacks in certain areas.  In conclusion, if you are craving some more Half-Life, you've come to right place, but don't expect anything more than that.",
