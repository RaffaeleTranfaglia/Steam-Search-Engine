I find this game more than worth the asking price of 'nothing,' and would go so far as to say I'd pay SEVERAL nothings for an experience of this caliber.",

And again, and again, and again, and again, until you get so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off that you click rapidly and hope to win the game. That is rare, but when you do, you feel good.

Especially if you're a 100% game gamer. The achieves have been added to TWICE now which means for those of us that perfected/100%-ed it the first time, we had to play the game one or two more times to keep it at 100%. Not Cool! This is a text game, similar to the old which-way adventure books. You are presented with a scenario with 1 to 3 choices. (Yeah, I know '1' choice isn't really a choice but you have no other option to choose from if you want to keep the game going) There's several different order of choices that can be chosen and will determine what achievements you may receive. This ends up being a long, drawn out game if you are in it for the achievements to get a 100% completion, with some achievements requiring a fairly deep correct set of choices to trigger.  Oh, did I mention you die almost every first or second choice? Yeah, not cool either. Stay away from at all costs, not worth the time &amp; effort, you WILL be greatly disappointed by this game, probably more so than any family member has disappointed you :P Update Dec 2015: They've just added another new xmas achieve with 10 new deaths. So not only is this another achievement, it's a limited time one at that. &gt;:(",
