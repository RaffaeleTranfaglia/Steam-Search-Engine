That is my only greivence with the game, which was my own fault. Aside from that, it is a very good game and the music to it from the very beginning is just down right phenomenal.",

            "review_text": "A good, dark and twisted plot that takes some unexpected turns. The main character (you) is far from the usual 'knight in shining armour' or complete div that seems to be the norm in these VN's  A lot of thought and effort has been taken with the story with even some of the the minor characters getting fleshed out in the differing paths. A very Japanese (unsurprisingly) view of the west (almost the stereotypical standpoint) is shown in some paths, which i believe is a regular stance for the producer Well worth the money if you are looking for VN that isnt all boobs and shagging or fluffy bunny girlies and/or you have a slightly darker view on the world A class above most VN’s on steam at the minute p.s. Although it may seem to be a marketing ploy the voice pack adds a great deal to overall ambiance of the title",

            "review_text": "A fantastic visual novel, and the money was well spent (bought alongside the Japanese voice pack). Please do not let the title of the novel mislead you. Especially those of you from the western world. It is a story of loyalty, revenge, unforgivable crimes and deep-seeded hatred. A brilliantly written piece of work, aimed at those who enjoy reading crime mysteries where the protagonist and antagonist clash time and time again. The dialogue between protagonist and antagonist is also pretty spectacular. An emotional rollercoaster. Arguably the best visual novel ever made.  Hope all of you out there who enjoy crime mysteries decide to pick this up. It's a definite steal for the price they're providing it at here on Steam.  9.5/10",

I really love that kind of feeling that reminds me a lot of Death Note/Code Geass. Also the soundtrack is really nice and fits the novel perfectly. Although you don't have a lot of choice moments on the game, your choices are impactful(at least, most of them) on the story as a whole. Even if you don't enjoy VNs as a thing, you can like 'The Devil on G-String'. Even though a lot of people don't see novel as games, you can still see it as a book, and I would recommend it anyway.",

I can't recommend the story enough in the way it portrays humanity and the psychology behind evil. I was very surprised at how good the writing was and how intriguing it turned out to be. All the way to the very good ending, the game is an amazing journey. I very much recommend this game.",

I feel I must however mention that this isn't the happiest Visual Novel. By no means is it the least happy, however several character's do not have a very nice backstory, And sometimes Great stories don't necessarily end with a happily ever after. That's not to say that none of the several endings are happy mind you just that if all you want is a sappy love story look elswhere. The most glaring problem in my books however is that with the exception of a certain path, The writing stops being as well done. Never bad mind you, however it really feels as if they put all of the effort into one story, and added the rest as an afterthought.   Overall I'd say this is worth every cent they ask, even more so if it's on sale, what with it's great story and wonderful music.",
