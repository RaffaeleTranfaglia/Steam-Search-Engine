            "review_text": "A surpisingly deep strategy game. In Airport Madness: Time Machine you run an airport by deciding when and where planes are allowed to takeoff and land. You have to keep a steady flow going of takeoffs and landings, without causing crashes.  The game begins in the early 30s and each level is one year later, each year introducing new features such as additional runways, faster planes, priority transports, etc.. What starts out really simple with simple queuing up planes quickly becomes a deep strategy of making sure runways are /just/ cleared when a new plane has to land or take off, dealing with multiple waiting planes and deciding the optimal order for them to launch, etc..  Visually the game is really underwhelming but the graphics do their job.  On my system the game started fullscreen stretched across three monitors, but fortunately pressing ESC once made it windowed.  Sound: music is limited to looping time period [ieces. Soundeffects are basic and limited to plane engine sounds. Control can be done completely via the mouse, or by using keys 1 through 5 on the keyboard once a plane is selected. A fun game that won't bore you too quickly, with decent length levels. Recommended for anyone who likes management strategy games.",

            "review_text": "Game is not fun. Totally frustrating. There is a lot of functionality missing that actually helps you manage the airport. The buildings are just cosmetic. All you get are more space for the planes and more runways.  Worst thing is when planes landed and are told to leave the runway but doing so at different speed. Even the same type of plane are sometimes fast and somestimes slow. This is a joke. I lost so many games because my calculations were wrong. It´s like gambling. Another thing is that you can´t tell planes where to start from. You can only do that when they land. And for now ♥♥♥♥ing reason they want to cross runways to go the other hangar. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Does not matter where the terminal is, the planes just go where they want. Totally random. You can plan nothing. Not fun to play.",

            "review_text": "If you're a fan of the other Airport Madness games, you'll probably like this one too. Unlike the other games, you have only one airport to play, but it expands over time. You start in the 1920s and play your airport until 1970, unlocking one year at a time. After you complete 1970, there are some bonus missions set in a steampunk 1800s and a futuristic 2100s airport.  You have less control of the planes on the ground in this one, as you can't direct them to which runway to take off from, but you can still control your planes in the air and have them land on a different runway.  Overall, I think I like Airport Madness: World Edition better (but you pay more for that one). This title offers the opportunity to watch an airport grow over time and play with some more classic airplanes that you don't see outside of museums and airshows today.  There were a few bugs (planes crash on the ground inexplicably in the 2100s airport), but nothing really gamebreaking. Each year you play is maybe 5-10 minutes so I never felt that I lost a lot if I did have a crash.  I completed the game in 8.6 hours.",
