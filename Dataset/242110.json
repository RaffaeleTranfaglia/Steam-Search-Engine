            "review_text": "This review is for the Mac port only.  While Joe Danger 2 seems to be an amazing game, the shortcomings of the Mac port ruin it for me. There are two major problems, both caused by the game's launcher overlay.  1. Inability to choose full screen mode. Why I'm only left with 'Windowed' mode is beyond me, as the game lists proper resolutions for my display to choose as window size.  2. The game recognizes my Logitech Rumblepad 2 controller, however the buttons simply don't work, just the X/Y controls. I'm sure this is something that could easily be fixed if the game had a control setup option. It does have one, in the launcher, ONLY for the keyboard. In the game itself you're only presented with a screen that 'explains' the controls with no option to re-bind them.  Some may argue that it's tricky to port games to a different OS, but with games like Rogue Legacy that handle controller support on Mac impeccably, there's just no room for excuse anymore. Full controller support? Not true.  All I can say is, I'm really glad I got this game as part of The Humble Indie Bundle X, because if I got this at full price I'd be furious right now.",

            "review_text": " If you like repetitive gameplay, this is for you. The various reskins, lack of variety, and tedious gameplay (which is quite easy) will please you. Again, if you like dull gameplay, I can't recommend this enough.   EDIT: It does get harder, but it still lacks some variety. It just feels very basic. The presentation is also terrible. If it were a game where gameplay were the focus I can see this being a worthy title, as it is a good sidescrolling runner, but its presentation is disgusting.",

Why? - The game in the beginig is kind of fun, but get repetitive and boring.  - Online is not online(on internet), it is LAN. - They tried (I think) to adapt the game to PC, but controls, effects and the performance are in general a shi*t - Unskippable cutscenes - The game is using xbox control as hints ON PC!  Just make your wallet happy, go buy something that worth",

(And I love the TF2 costumes)  I didn't expect to like it, as it doesn't have much depth, but it's just too fun, especially as a party game. The Linux version is perfect by the way.",
