This is just an arcade shooter version of the orignal with all the mission fun removed. Why they pulled the original and just left this is beyond me",

In case you dont know what 'SCOREPOCALYPSE!!!' means, according by me studieing it, it means well YOU KNOW WHAT IM LIEING SO I DONT KNOW! XD Anyway, in this one, you must try to get the biggest score while at the same time, the party from the original are making there way to 'Da air base', YOU, are doing 'Scorepocalypse'. 'Dev medal' achievements were REALLY hard, especially the mall dev medal. Very challenging game, with a lot of fun guns, zombies, missions, and achievements. Great work on this sequel guys! Keep it up once more! &lt;3  8/10",
