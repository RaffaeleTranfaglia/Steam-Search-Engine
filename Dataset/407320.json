            "review_text": "With around 4 1/2 hours finishing one ending of the game I can say it achieved what it set out to do, at least for me. I cared about the two girls and always thought how I would react in situations independent from the choices you can make in the game. I find the characters interesting even if they are little children and not overly deep. As others noted in their reviews the voice acting is really good in my opinion. Listening to the two children warmed my heart even though I dont have children myself. I play a lot of different visual novels and not every visual novel needs 18+ scenes. Something heartwarming like this little story is as good as some sexy scenes. Especially with the ending I got first, where I could totally understand the dilemma everybody felt even though it was the right decision to make.  Hopefully they add some cards so we can enjoy the art as backgrounds and smileys. =)",
