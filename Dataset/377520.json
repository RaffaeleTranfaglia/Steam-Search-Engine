Huge blocks of infantry marching towards each other through hailstorms of lead bullets. Nice asynchronous PBEM++ multiplayer model. Graphics somewhat crude, but its secondary to the gameplay. Also, Gustavus Adolphus campaign. Enough said :)",

Personally, I do not enjoy this game much. The skirmish is too ease for me. You can win easily by concentrate your cav on one flank. On the other hand, the historical battle and campaign are difficult for noobs like me. (Yes, you can win New Port and a few other battles, but most battles are difficult because you are out numbered) So I would not recommand it to noob wargamers.",
