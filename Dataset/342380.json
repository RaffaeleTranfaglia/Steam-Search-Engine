The cute Japanese voices definitely help give you a good image on how the characters would walk, move, interact and the like. The CG is beautiful. And the writing gets you giggling. The story doesn't take itself too seriously, and why should it? I'm not going to give any spoilers, but these girls definitely aren't culinary masters.  And now for me to complain a bit - Why is the CG so disconnected from the writing? It's a visual novel, if you're going to put the protagonist in particular situations, why not draw it? Yes, our imaginations are the ones that need to work here. But black screens would have been enough if you wanted that. There are so many points in the story where I really wanted to see what was happening. It's a visual novel, so let me see what I'm reading! Not to mention how many unanswered questions I have...  That aside, I'm glad I picked this up at the five dollar price. I can say that the tease is only worth that much. But pick it up if you can, because it's a mighty good tease, and there's going to be more, so support the artists and creators so that they can support us, and give us more of what we need. A deeper story with more characters (wouldn't mind seeing some male characters for diversity. There needs to be something there to make the story more intersting!) More CG to depict the various parts of the story (Be a visual novel more) and perhaps be clear with your aim for the choices. If they could branch more and allow the story to take different directions, that'd make the story fun to play multiple times. Or just make your story longer, and leave the choices as spice to make scenes slightly different. Either way it was a joy to read, and I definitely want more.  TL;DR version: Get it while it's cheap. It's worth the laugh, the awe and the distraction. Just not the full ten dollars.",

As with Sakura Spirit, the heroines of Sakura Angels are cute, the art pretty, granted, but similarities end there. The short comings in Sakura Angels run too deep.  Actually, everything feels shorted and there is no depth.  Alas, Sakura Angels just can't really be called something that I like. -Too few plates (20 vs 30 for S. Spirit) -Too few backgrounds that do NOT reflect the story mood. -A miserable, borish protagonist coupled with -Terrible writing/ story telling  I tried to give the story a chance, I did. Heck, I finished it. But I did set it aside several times as the story line just couldn't keep my interest or the wimpy protagonist just irritated me to the Quit button....  There are a couple of narrative choices offered, likely slightly shifting the story and, apparently, affecting the gallery plates (still 2 short). However, I won't be putting myself through reading the story again just for a couple gallery pics.",

Gameplay consists largely of clicking through text. There are perhaps a half dozen prompts that allow interaction beyond reading and clicking for the next text to pop up. The graphics, limited voice acting, and music are the only redeeming qualities of this 'game'.  Overall the story of Sakura Angels is mediocre. If this was an anime I'd probably turn it on while I worked on something else but the overarching story involving the protagonist is full of anime fanboy tropes and cliches. Most of the other characters are so incredibly one-dimensional and function more as props than full-blown characters.  I might buy this for half the given price as a distraction and to have the music and screenshots. Otherwise, I suggest players pass and try out other visual novels that offer more interactivity than Sakura Angels, otherwise there is plenty of manga/anime out there that offers better stories and won't result in carpal tunnel.",

Its like watching Anime, but with semi-still images, and people who fight by smashing in to each other. Good story, This isn't a game you get for gameplay, there is a lot of reading. The characters have been developing nicely thus far. Im not sure where I am at in the story, but it feels like it might end soon. I definintly want more stuff by these developers. Its a good 'Game'. I use quotation marks, as there is a lack of gameplay, but thats how it was designed. Its more of a visual novel, that you sometimes interact with. I'd personally give it a 78/100 so far. It only gets better as I go on. I did have to hold down space bar through some parts, as the computer is convinently placed in the kitchen, but I later re-visit these parts with the quick-load option, which is awesome for somthing like this. Makes it easy to see what other options do. So, all in all. Do I recommend this? Yea, but only if you are willing to read for hours on end. 78/100",

Oh Just remembered gotta cover the bases, if there is anything I would complain about maybe the fact that at one point its suppose to be just absolutely pouring rain, and you cannot tell other than the constant mention of it as the game used the same BG's for those scene as the normal day BG, so that was a bit immersion breaking, felt a tad cheap, but all in all still a good game.
