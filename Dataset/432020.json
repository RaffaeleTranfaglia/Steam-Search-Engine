            "review_text": "To be blunt, What's Under Your Blanket is nothing more than a tongue-in-cheek jerk off simulator with terrible Paint quality graphics.  The game is comprised of five levels, and five sub-levels. During the main five levels, your objective is to play with 'what's under your blanket' while avoiding getting caught, setting your blanket on fire, and breaking your bed. You must achieve your goal within two minutes by quickly clicking on your blanket to fill up your jerk-o-meter. The faster you click without interruption, the higher your multiplier climbs. The higher your multiplier climbs, the faster your jerk-o-meter fills.  Every now and then a family member, or special guest for the current level that you are on, will interrupt you. If you get caught, or set your blanket on fire from jerking... I mean clicking too fast, it's back to the beginning of the entire game for you. I might also mention here that there is no save function, and no pause menu. The escape key will also immediately close your entire game.  The five sub-levels are simple arm wrestling competitions, and barely favor a mention whatsoever. They're thrown into the game for filling the void of an otherwise empty game. Just click away until you finally win.  Don't get me wrong. I had a laugh my first playthrough of What's Under Your Blanket. However, when I revisited the game for a second time to clean up the achievements I missed the first time, due to the fact that they were broken upon the launch of the game and have only been recently patched, the humor was gone and I was bored... stiff. *badum tsh*  Truly, games such as this are destined to end up on places such as Newgrounds... but Steam? It's hard to fathom that this title made it to the actual store front. I know that I'm not helping to keep trash like this off of Steam since I actually purchased this title, but I do hope that games such as this and Shower With Your Dad Simulator are one-offs, and not a sign of things to come.   Rating:  1.0/5.0  - It's Bad.",

            "review_text": "Aside from the momentary humor of having your parents walk in on you when you jerk off, this game is not worth buying. I say that and I was still gifted this game. I did not actually buy it. Seriously, save your dollar and go buy a cheese burger from McDonalds (Even though they are more like 1.50 now, but whatever. You get my point).   This game is overall just ♥♥♥♥. You have to mash down your mouse button in order to masturbate. I have the humor of a 12 year old that just found out what the word ♥♥♥♥♥ means and even I didn't find this funny. As others have said, it will wear down your mouse unless you have a turbo button for your left click like I do. I've come not to expect much from games on steam that costs a dollar, but at least there are a few games out there that are a dollar that are still worth playing. This is not.   I implore you! Don't buy this ♥♥♥♥. It's not worth it. Just don't. There needs to be a higher standard of quality of games that get accepted to the steam marketplace. This is just pathetic at this point. It's even more pathetic how this game is very positive.",

Instructions don't tell you how, just 'WASD to move, Mouse to interract, close door after somebody opens it.'  No mention that I need to click repeatedly on the blanket, no mention that I'm not allowed to click too fast, or anything. Even following proper instructions, all this is is rapidly clicking on a blanket... WTF?",

            "review_text": "[ENG / FR]  [ENG]  'What's under your blanket !?' is a lonely guilty pleasure simulator that make you embody a young teenager with his enormous libido through 5 levels. The aim is to fill a pleasure gauge by clicking frenetically on the blanket that hides the 'hero'. Your time is limited and you have to watch out for not being seen by other characters that come across the room frequently. Each of the 5 levels is followed by an arm-wrestling challenge against a new opponent that you have to win by filling another gauge by clicking very fast. What can we remember from that game after finishing it in half an hour?  + 2 successive kinds of levels (Lonely pleasure / Arm-wrestling challenge) + Very easily unlockable achievements + Small price + Short game (In this case it actually is a good point)  - Painful for the wrist and the carpal tunnel - Pitiful Paint-made drawings - Quickly coded (Poor collisions management) - Only 2 audio tracks for the whole game - No pause option - No save option - Very limited interest to play it again  Funny during the first 5 minutes (Well, let's say that it could make you smile), that little game can really quickly become painful for the hand and the wrist. The developper's name (One Game Studio) sums up the game itself: a funny idea that came to a developper that wanted to make some money without bothering with a finished and complete game. Probably a first game concept that its young developper wants to make us pay for. If Steam would have allowed us to vote 'So so' along with 'Yes' and 'No', this is how it would have been recommanded.  ▬  [FR]  Simulateur de petits plaisirs solitaires, 'What's under your blanket !?' propose de se glisser dans la peau d'un préadolescent et de sa libido débordante, le temps de 5 niveaux.  Le but du jeu est de faire monter une jauge de plaisir en cliquant frénétiquement sur la couverture dissimulant le 'héros', dans le temps imparti, tout en faisant attention à ne pas être vu par les autres personnages qui apparaîssent régulièrement à l'écran. Chacun des 5 niveaux est suivi d'un bras de fer contre un nouvel adversaire, contre lequel il faudra également remplir une jauge en cliquant à toute vitesse pour gagner le match. Que retenir de ce petit jeu, après l'avoir fini en une demie-heure?  + 2 types de niveaux se succédant (Plaisir solitaire / Bras de fer) + Succès très simples à débloquer + Petit prix + Jeu court (Dans ce cas, c'est un point positif)  - Épouvrant pour le poignet et le canal carpien - Graphismes réalisés sous Paint pitoyables - Codé à la va-vite (Collisions avec le décor mal gérées) - 2 pistes sonores pour tout le jeu - Impossibilité de mettre le jeu en pause - Impossibilité de sauvegarder la partie - Rejouabilité limitée  Amusant les 5 premières minutes (Disons plutôt 'qui prête à sourire'), ce petit jeu peut vite devenir douloureux pour la main et le poignet. Le nom du développeur, 'One Game Studio', résume le jeu à lui tout seul: une idée rigolote qui a germé dans l'esprit de quelqu'un qui a voulu se faire un peu d'argent sans se casser la tête à faire un vrai jeu complet et fini. Probablement une première tentative de création de jeu que le jeune développeur aura voulu rentabiliser. Si Steam proposait de voter 'Bof', plutôt que 'Oui' et 'Non', c'est ce qu'il aurait mérité.",
