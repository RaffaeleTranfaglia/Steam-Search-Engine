            "review_text": "I used to be in love with the franchise mode in Madden. I would often let my coaches run the game, and just keep drafting, acquiring, and building up talent like a GM. I looked forward eagerly to each new Madden with the various updates for the franchise mode on any given year. I posted about my GM obsession about Madden on MaddenMania, and talked about how I would love Madden to really embrace what it was like to be a GM, and to really flesh out franchise mode as much as possible. Someone said I was just describing a game that already existed and pointed me to FOF. I saw it was everything I had hoped for. I come to FOF. Now, you can do a lot more. There's massive expansion of playcalling in this iteration. You can do a lot. And it let's me live vicariously through the game. Don't like what's happening in real life? Change it! This year, I took my beloved Jags (instead of 2- and suck) to 11-5, won the AFC South, lost to the Raiders in the divisional round, and had a lot of fun doing it. No sports sim is as detailed, fleshed, or as realistic as this one.   It's worth picking up. And it's another strong, stable-from-release product that you expeect from Jim over at Solecismc Games.",

            "review_text": "I have owned every version of this game.. Does anyone remember the first version when you could bet on the games. I thought that was awesome. At the time, nothing else came close to a sim game of football. Even today, nothing comes close. The last couple of version I never felt like I was truly in the game. This game for me at least has that immersion factor. Setting up the game plan, plays etc. I now actually feel like a coach in a football simulation world. This is truly the best version of the bunch..Awesome job Jim!! Here are just two things that I hope get put in. Standings, would like to see home and away wins/losses. The next thing is watching solevision, being able to see ball position on the field moving back and forth like coaching mode in previous versions. big yellow block of space up above not fully being utilized. Those two things would make this the perfect football simulation in my oppinion.",

Such a great game, i love doing battle with 31 other real life gm's. this game never gets old, i have been playing the fof series for almost 10 years of real life time. the developer actually listens to input from his games players and makes those changes for them, hence fof 8. get it, get in the game, get in the mp environment and enjoy.",

The simulation is best suited for those who want substance and not button mashing. The developer is conservative with the GUI, but committed to a solid simulation.  In FOF8 the major changes to game planning are solid new (optional) turn in the life of the franchise.",
