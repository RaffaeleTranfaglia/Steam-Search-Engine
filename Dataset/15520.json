Sure, the first 5 or 10 minutes you think the game is kinda cool, but by minute 15 you will have decided the game is a bit boring and repititous, by minute 30 you will have decided the game is no longer fun to play, and after 2 hours of game play you will think there are far better uses of Harddrive space than AaAaAA!!! - A Reckless Disregard for Gravity.",

It's fun for about 15 minutes, but then you just keep doing the same thing over and over again. There's only so much fun you can have in a game about jumping off buildings. Well....maybe that's not true, but there's only so much fun you can have in this game.  You start each round by jumping off a building. Points are scored for getting close to objects without hitting them, interacting with people (thumbs up or flipping off), flying through certain gates, and sticking your landing. This gameplay can only interest you for so long. The controls work well enough while falling, except controlling after deploying your parachute can be a little awkward.  The visuals are bright and intense, but not all that interesting. There are lots of flashing lights which could be problematic to some people. The music is fast and somewhat entertaining. Maybe the best part of the game.  I could not recommend this game for more than a few minutes playtime. Fire it up if you got it in a bundle, but you will quickly put it back away.  Grade: D+",

Rude gesture to all the protesters out there.   Graphics: Simple polygons, but everything is distinctive enough that you can make out what's what during high speeds.  Sound: Enough entertaining noises to distract you from how annoyed you are.  Music: Not good enough to listen to on its own, but well suits the pace of the game.  Controls: Standard look and movement bindings, but I should figure out better bindings for the other actions. I end up accidentally pressing a wrong key at inopportune times.  Did I Finish It: Not 100%, but I got to the end.  Will I Play it Again: Depends on how much content is in AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!!, which I have yet to play. It's is supposed to have the same levels remastered, so I'm going to say no.  Should You Buy It: If the above holds true, they're the same price so don't bother.",

I don't see myself playing this to the point of obsession, but I will definitely play until I unlock everything and see what else I can do with it.   For those of you who are like me, and entirely too afraid to actually participate in extreme sports like base jumping, this will confirm your belief that you're really not cut out for it. You will be perfectly satisfied to sit in your chair, breathe in through your nose, out through your mouth, and imagine yourself floating to the ceiling.   A fun little game that doesn't take itself too seriously, and has enough silly humor to make you smile - note that you won't laugh uproariously, but I don't believe that was the point of this, anyway.   Gameplay is top notch, soundtrack is fun and funny, and I will definitely enjoy any time period in which I play this game, but I seriously doubt I will get addicted to it. One of those rare gems that's worth anyone's time, even iff you just have a few minutes to kill. I, personally, enjoy games that don't require a huge time investment in order to understand what they're about and have fun with them, and this is definitely the type where your boredom will die for a bit.   Plus, after you play for an hour or so you'll exit and still feel like you're playing it.   Neat. 8/10.  (Small edit: I mean it's not very addictive. I meant to say that it was fun, but I don't see myself getting addicted to it. Fixed.)",

The idea of base jumping through futuristic, laser-skyway cities has some definite appeal, but when it amounts to simply traversing around elongated blocks at a steady pace with some retro acid-trip inspired background trying to compete for eye focus, the product leaves you wanting.  The humor is 'LOL so randum XD' and the devs shamelessly plugged themselves into a number of levels. The game is basically built around high scores, in the same vein as classic arcade games. But when the leaderboards are dominated by hackers (a million points in the tutorial level? Please) with no moderation in sight, that takes out the possibility of an ePeen simulator.  One positive about this game is the level design. Some of the courses are really cunning, and I like game designers that twist and bend the rules of their own game to make a variety of new experiences.",

The only involvement with other players is the leaderboard. Storyline is told through in the level selection by the stoner radio host.

First and foremost is the lack of controller support, which given the twitch nature of the gameplay seems like a must. Secondly, the game does not feature any interesting music and the sound effects particularly for the parachute are quite poor. I had fun with this title for a few minutes, but the tedium grows as these flaws repeat over each game session.
