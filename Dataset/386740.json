At the beginning of your turn an ante gem is added to your pool. At the end of your turn you buy a chip from a custom or random bank that is shared by all players. Use the chips you buy to keep your gem pool the lowest and then KO someone else at 10+. I'm having fun with the 4-player AI battles. Thanks for the Linux version!",
