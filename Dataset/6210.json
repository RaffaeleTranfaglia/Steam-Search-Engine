It's a journey in the truest sense of the word, replete with tragedy, heartache, tension, fear, and even brief moments of catharsis. Calling Vega$: Make It Big a work of entertainment almost seems like a misnomer, considering the heavy tone and general lack of sentimentality in the writing. This is a must have for any true gamer.",

All shops outside, build rest rooms, ye really let my guest leave the casino to use the rest rooms out doors.   The Default build template for the casion made me laugh, nickle slots near all entrences and exits, with progressive to get people in the doors. i can see build pools out door bars and attactions built on outside. i dunno it failed to capture Vegas and i really wana visit again but its to exensive.

Maybe its just me who thinks this its my opinon thats why I have to say I don't recommend this game .",
