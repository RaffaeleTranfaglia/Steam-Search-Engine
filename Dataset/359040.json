            "review_text": "Bravo, David Szymanski! I loved this weird game and I do recommend experiencing it. It’s definitely not for everyone and it is more of “an experience” than “a game”.  Story is sad and beautiful. Visuals are… interesting.  Game is 1-2 hours long so I don't want to spoil anything by going into details. Just make sure that you get to the very end.    There is a “good” ending and a “bad” ending.   ",

            "review_text": "The Music Machine is a deeply troubling and disturbing experience presented in an excellently handled style. For a horror veteran, maybe the horrific implications and actual creepy scenes will be unfazing, but for a softie like myself, it really hit me deep a couple of times. Of course I won't spoil anything here, this is a purely story-driven game afterall, but I can say this much: There are no jumpscares, just scary environments and scenarios. The story revolves around two characters... kinda: Haley, the 13-year old girl who you are controlling, and Quintin, the ghost of a 34-year old man that Haleys father pumped full of lead after Haley excused him of molesting her... when in reality Quinint rejected the 'love' Haley showed for him. And now Quintin's ghost possesses Haleys body and tries to get her killed. This is why he brought her to an island where horrendously deformed corpses have popped up multiple times, corpses full of holes. Quintin wishes to seek out the one who caused these injuries and leave Haley in his or her professional hands. Quite a messed up setup. But the strangest thing is: Haley and Quintin still lead calm conversations, and Haley still shows affection for Quintin. There seems to be little hostility between the two... besides Quintin's very clear intentions. And so this pair of deeply troubled and hurt characters uncover the secrets of this strange island, and believe it or not, it gets even weirder. But any more info would be spoilers, so I'll leave the rest for you to find out.  The surreal and disturbing story of the game gets supported by a very surreal and unusual artstyle. A 3d world consisting only of a single colour and heavy shadows. For the first few minutes I thought the stark contrast would be a bit weary on the eye, but my eyes soon adjusted to it. The style also brings the benefit of being not very taxing for your computer, so you probably won't have to worry whether your computer can handle it or not, it most likely can. The biggest downside I could see for the game is its length. I beat it in 90 minutes, and after you beat it there is pretty much nothing else to do. It's up to you whether you think that time is worth it for the price. I found the game intruiging, and while it's a bit hard to define whether I enjoyed it or not, it definitely left and impact on me, and it will probably stay with me for a while. The story might not be for everyone, I can imagine that the horror aspects won't be effective for everyone, all I know is that it worked for me. A good friend of mine who is a horror veteran also played through the game and enjoyed it so much that he bought it for me and forced me to play it, so I think that even if you don't get scared by it, you will still get your money's worth.  TL;DR:  Pros:  -unique unsettling story  -interesting and relatable characters -visually interesting and disturbing world -pretty much any semi-modern pc can handle it fine  Cons:  -takes only 90 minutes to finish -little to no replay value  I don't like final scores, so I won't add one.  Cave Johnson, we're done here.",

            "review_text": "The Music Machine is an eerie adventure game that's set on a deserted island, where you play as a teenage girl called Haley, who is possessed by a spirit of a man who passed away, named Quintin, who has control over Haley and ultimately wants his revenge. The story unravels as you progress.   PROS: + Simplistic, yet satisfying graphics + Sweet character interaction dialogues + Good story + Unique environment and level design + Great ambience throughout the entire game + Fair price + Can run just fine on lesser devices + Trading cards  CONS: - Quite short gameplay (2-3 hours (the price is right for it though)) - Walking can be annoying when in confined spaces and in general for too long - Playing for too long in one go can cause eye soreness  Anyone looking for a quick, unique horror-ish adventure: get this game.  My rating: 8.5/10",

            "review_text": "So this is actually the first review I write about a game and that says something. I saw the game being played in a Let's Play Video on youtube and was sucked into it immediately. The characters are written very realistically, the dialogue is snappy short and helpful for the story and the story...well it was basically why I wanted to play the game. It's dark and somewhat ironic and something new. Maybe not the newest of new but the twist and the way you play the game is new, at least for me. The graphics are not realistic or claim to be, they are minimalistic but beautiful and fit the overall feel of the game. Its a very artsy game and has great atmosphere that is supported by the sounds and the music. I loved the suspense throughout the game when you get deeper and deeper into the story and since the tag says horror I was waiting for jumpscares or anything other but really it's more the story, the thoughts of the character and some designs in the worlds rather than flatout 08/15 horror elements. It's subtle but makes you feel slightly uneasy during the playthrough. So I really recommend the game to anyone looking for an emotional journey thought a world of art with heavy, great atmosphere and a touching dark story without too much happening but yet enough to not make the game feel empty. Story and the elements of adventuring the maps are in a very satisfying balance. I have no idea if this review even made sense. Still: I really, really enjoyed playing this game and recommend it with all my heart!",

            "review_text": "Interesting experiment, and quite well-written. But while I normally enjoy shorter games, I felt the brevity of this one works against it, in that it doesn't give enough room for the characters to develop. What's there was great, but I wanted to know more, and would have prefered it if the story had a bit more meat. There are also several ways to get a 'bad' ending, which forces you to restart the game. It's short and you can sprint through what you've already played, but it would be better if it put you back near where you died, rather than this.   I can't recommend it to everyone, but there is something with promise here.",

            "review_text": "Discomfort and Tension. These two words sum up this atmospheric masterpiece perfectly. Throughout the entire game I was convinced I was a few moments away from a jump scare or some frightful enemy that would devour me in a cheap way. This moment never came though and was a blessing. The island and other planes that I visited in the journey created the discomfort and tension I would feel from a sudden scare and streamed it across the entire narrative instead of in asimple moment. The protagonists were a bit hard to relate to however. Throughout the game your presented with breif conversations between th two which revealed an interesting backstory although I feel as though it was not fully explored as much as it could have been. The conclusions available to the player through their actions were quite satisfying. My only gripe about this game is the aesthetic of the island. It wasn't bad but in comparison to the other areas in the game it was awful bland looking.  Anyone interested in an interesting Horror adventure game should defintely check this out it's not one worth missing.",

The story is just as mysterious and engrossing, and the locations are much more imaginative. Despite how different the game looks and plays, it keeps the same intriguing feeling as The Moon Sliver and shares some narrative connections to it. I'm excited about David Szymanski's upcoming games, as he definitely has some interesting ideas and is improving with each title.",

The Music Machine is a little bit less of a walking simulator than its predecessor, The Moon Sliver, however the two games still share a minimalist aesthetic. The Music Machine sports a unique (even more minimalist) monochromatic visual style, further differentiating it from its predecessor. The puzzles that need to be solved to progress are also more apparent as is the fact that there are even puzzles to solve, not just a story to piece together. It's a bit longer than The Moon Sliver and a bit more explicit in its revelations.   If you find the fact that this review is mostly a comparison to the previous game by this developer in this world that you haven't played, then play The Moon Sliver. Szymanski's style of emotional resonance revolves around the slow build to each horrible insight and a few of those will be diminished without the context The Moon Sliver provides.",
