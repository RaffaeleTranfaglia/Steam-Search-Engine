That being said, it's not a bad game overall, it's just not worth 4,99€. The game mechanics are pretty solid, and the artstyle is pretty well-done. Nevertheless, I don't recommend picking this game up for anything more than 0,99€. ",

Store page says it has Full Controller Support, however Steam Controller does not just 'work' with the game. Had to map the joystick to up, down, left, right, and a button to 'enter'   The default keyboard controls are kind of cramped being you use arrow keys and enter, instead of wasd and enter.  *edit* After reboot if the game wasd with enter did work. *edit*  Overall with remapping the controller the game is fun, would not recommend for keyboard only users. Does not have full controller support, otherwise would recommend.",
