            "review_text": "This is the kind of game where you wrap yourself in a blanket, grab a hot drink and get ready for a feels trip. So beautifully designed. The artists really know how to immerse you into the world. The story is beautiful, really makes you think deeper than you normally would. The characters are lovable and you really get into them. Since this game is about desicion making, it really makes you want to do multiple play throughs.  I questioned the price tag on this game at first and wondered if was worth it. But I am so happy I decided to get it. It's absolutely worth it and I highly recommend you get this game and experience it for yourself.",

            "review_text": " This game is just Awesome &lt;3   Well I don't know where to start :p One day I was roaming on steam and saw this game and added on my wishlist I like adventure and 2d games and its gameplay attracted me and so in this winter sell I bought it But its actually more 3d game than 2d! This game has really won my heart with its heart touching story,graphix,lighting and sound effects Daedalic Games put lot of efforts on this Game But I think te story is too short .It will take not more than 6 hours to complete the story But thats not enough for me.I love this game so much hat I wish I could roam on silence for at least 100 hours  But if you are gonna go for achievements you have to spend 12+ hour.It took me 13.4 hours to achieve all the achievements One important thing do not skip a single dialogue.Because the story is the main thing in this game.you have to watch more cutscenes and dialogues than the playtime This thing makes ths game much special.It feels like its u who is wondering in a wonderland and everything is just like a movie. This game is really worth it. 30 dollar is a fair price If u wanna go for a fairytale adventure then wait no more,this game is just for you This is a point and click game if you play with keyboard &amp; mouse But with gamepad you will get much more chance to roam freely.I played with a xbox 360 gamepad and it was awesome I played with keyboard and mouse too and the difference is you can point and know about more things if you are playing with mouse.amepad allows you to point on only the primary objects So in both ways this game is good So do not think much and grab this awesome game and lose yourself in the world of Silence where crystal lakes shine,forests are much green,PLay with those naughty lumis and your best friend sadwick and cute spotty &lt;3 A must buy game and I can write forever about this game .Because this game mesmerized me :D",

            "review_text": "Hi, everyone! Really hope this review will actually be read and that it will help someone. I'm Alex and have quite the experience in point 'n' clicks. Well Silence... I've played the first part of the game, which is 'Whispered World', a long time ago. And it was impressive. This part... Hm. I haven't finished it yet, still somewhere in the middle, but I already have some things to say to you I always pay attention to 4 things that, in my opinion, make a good point 'n' clock adventure: atmosphere, plot, puzzles and soundtrack ATMOSPHERE It is beautiful. No doubt here. However each and every location looks EXACTLY as the previous one. And that is truly annoying.You know, it is a nice fairy tale. Whispered world was melanholic, sad. beatuful, depressing... And everyone loved it for that atmosphere. Here - they lost it. Or maybe I just haven't gotten to the good part yet 4/10 PLOT Back to the world of Silence. I loved the story of Whispered World and I love it here. The characters are well written and this magical world of sleep, false queen... 9/10 SOUNDTRACK It is one of those soundtracks that you don't notice, but it is 'introducing' you to the game. Not something over-the-head, not musically genious, but it is high quality. 7/10 PUZZLES OMG WHAT HAVE YOU DONE! I was surprised, guys. Not on a good or a bad way. Just surprised. They decided to do something between classical point n click and visual novel. The plot is linear as usual, the gameplay is similar to all point'n'clicks. But there is no inventory! It is not about collecting and using items. If you pick smth up, you'll use it immediately. Ut makes it easier. Too much easier. 3/10  Spot = 10/10. I love the guy. He is cute as hell and he kind of saves the whole game. But seriously. Counting on the catterpillar to be the best part of the game? Well. Not cool   Verdict : 6/10. Still playable. Still beautiful. Not as good as it could be",
