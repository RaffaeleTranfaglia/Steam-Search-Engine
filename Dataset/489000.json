            "review_text": "That's my first ever review of a free game. I feel like I must review it because it is kinda weird.   When playing this, don't expect a lot of gameplay and stuff. All you need to do is click places. Yup. Looks and sounds boring right ? Well, dont get me wrong, if you try and play this solo, it is the most boring and the baddest game ever made. Not even joking. However, this game is all about the community and the relaxation. This is the kind of game in which you just take a deep breath, put some custom chill music and relax while clicking and talking with people. Still sounds boring huh ? Well it is not because the community is AMAZING.  When I made my account and logged in this game, I litteraly havent even played 20 seconds before a whole guild came to me, recruited me, explained everything to me and made me hunt with their fleets. Its a blast when we all group together and make a huge fleet that crushes everything in its way, while chatting and having fun with the community chat. When you destroy enemy ships, you get resources, mainly metal. You can sell them for money, or you can use the metal to heal yourself or anther player's sheep. Well in this game, people dont even hesitate before throwing their metal (basically in game money) to heal you and keep everyone going. People in this game are awesome.   If you are interested, give it a go, login and search for me or for the Corporation (Guilds are called corporation) called 'Dracolich'. Seriously these guys are awesome. Long story short, worth playing to chill, not worth playing if you want deep gameplay.",

            "review_text": "The Infinite Black is a unique MMO, with less focus on flashy graphics and more focus on community. The game play is very simple in concept, yet with so many roles, tactics, PVP and PVE variants, plus a great many different levels and combinations of equipment and stats you can focus on one or multiple areas of expertise and play your own type of game. Play only the areas you like, follow players of like minds or lead them yourself!  The mods and devs play an active part in the game and for the most part seem to be interested in keeping the game fair, current, and interesting. The player base has evolved over years, but there are serious TIB warriors that have been around since the beginning. Mods, devs, and players are all fmailiar with each other creating a family-like (yet largely dysfucntional!) atmosphere.  A unique feature of the TIB experience is that - with some notable exceptions - player feedback is taken seriously and integrated into the game where possible and fair. Get in to TIB, get your grind on, meet players and settle in for a very interesting, rewarding ride.  TIB places you into the Gold server to start, but the largest number of players (and most experienced) can be found on Grey. Join a corporation and see if it fits your style of play and personality, then have fun!",

You will be farming pirates and Brigands in no time... Upgrade and level your ship and save those credits to purchase the best gear you can find.Its addictive and challenging. The learning curve is a lttle steep at the start, but this is more reason to get into a corp straight away... players from all corners of the earth are more than willing to help and teach the game. Then once you are strong enough, get out into the Black. Where the real game starts....and where the big boys ply there evil trade. This is not a high end graphics space game. But for what it is, it works really well. Im looking forward to experiencing the depth that this game offers.",

While there is pay to win currency, you earn the BD in very rare drops and for leveling bonuses. You could easily get to endgame not spending a real dollar, by trading with players who did.  Fun enough I would recommend for the ocd grinding crowd. Take it with you, play it on the can, play it on yer computer.  Talked with a mod about it today multibox with 5 accounts and not get banned!

Attack Speed ranges from 6 seconds to 30 seconds and more. Which is the time you need to wait before you fire. My 6 second starter weapon made me wait like 1 minute and more for 1 enemy to die. That is the game loop. The game is basically a psychological reward box. Nothing more. But I think I am over the times where I found much enjoyment in achievements popping up.  The interface is just horrible for PC. Might work on mobile though.  Of course you can help yourself over the waiting and endless grind with purchases from their store.  If you dare to criticise the game in the in-game chat, you will be insulted and chewed out immediately. The community is very toxic.  Avoid it.",

It's the simplist game on earth next to the likes of cookie clicker, All you do is click on enemy ships and click on little squares on the map to move and fight. You do this till you level up and can do it a little easier. (And I do mean 'little' new ships are about 5% better than the last one.)  That is literally THE ENTIRE GAME. Clicking on 2-3 icons for eternity. I can see this being a mediocre time waster on a smartphone, but you need to jump into oncomming traffic if your playing this on a PC. I even pushed through this boring game for multiple hours just to be absolutely sure this was the entire game. It is.",

            "review_text": "Well unfortunately the game is just like in the video, but that is most of the problem and why I can't recommend this game. This game has no real goals or motivation to do anything other than getting to a better ship and maybe attacking things with a friend or friends in the same HEX. You simply just click each HEX to move around without any real point other than what the group makes up or to find boring things to attack. Even in the small amount of time I played I did got through a few ships and a few levels which was ok, but each new ship didn't seem more rewarding than the previous. The thing I noticed the most is you don't make enough credits (money) to start out and repair at the same time in hopes to saving money. You can literally sit around in space and heal overtime, but how fun is that? None.  Lastly, I checked out this game over the last couple months and the thing that resulted heavily on not recommending this game is the same positive reviews I read a bit ago were deleted and reposted on same accounts to boost the 'Recent' community review. Which was easy to spot given this game barely gets a review every couple or few days and instantly gets about 16 reposts to boost it in a postive direction. I remember the names (about 12) because I read some of them the previous day just before they changed them each day to fit in the 'recent timeframe'. At that same time the review opinion went from mostly negative to mixed negative to positive due to these same named accounts! Very under-handed and sneaky by the DEVs, admins, sponsored or whoever those reposting accounts belong to, but 'boosting' definitely happened here; which is just sad. Believe what you like, but I saw it, caught it and thought what a shame.   Don't get me wrong I bet there are a couple 'real' reviews out there, but not many. What would've granted an actually 'real' recommend would be for this underhanded BS to not get caught and the game had some visual effects, THERE ARE NO ANIMATIONS and the SOUND EFFECTS are simply horrible!   PROS  It's a Sci-Fi game....well at least it tried to do this anyways   CONS  Obvious review boosting Horrible sound effects No replay value Not rewarding No Animations No Visual effects Money you earn does not match what you need or by level",
