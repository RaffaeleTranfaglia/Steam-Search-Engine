            "review_text": "Are you one of those people who don't want to read a ♥♥♥♥-ton of text describing the mechanics of the game? Then i'll keep it simple.  Dex is great game that is hard to recommend despite it being so good.  It has so many issues, as well as some baffling basic design oversights, that it would easily turn off so many people from the very start.  However if you dig through the dirt, mud and other various amounts of filth, you'll find something that truly shines with a LOT of potential, especially in comparison to what's currently on Steam as of late.  The melee combat and shooting all packs a punch and is very enjoyable. The RPG mechanics are varied, robust and are tailored to how YOU want to play, as well as the story and world the devs created being extremely interesting and a unique take on the genre.  Thing is you'll have to dig a through a lot of ♥♥♥♥ to fully enjoy it. Dex is a bit like Alpha Protocol in that regard. Lot of potential, but is so bugged up the fudge hole that a person suffering from Crabs would cringe. It all depends on how much you can suffer through.  For those wanting a proper review there's more after the break...    //////////////   Alright, time to go balls deep into Dex.  If i had to describe what Dex is to someone i'd say this:  Dex is a third-person, side scrolling RPG that has a large emphasis on a unique hacking premise with some shooting and brawling and even some basic stealth mixed in for good measure. The game is set in a original cyberpunk world where augmentations are all the rage and hacking is a good way to rack up some cash, this is all drawn and animated in astounding detail which creates a very interesting aesthetic.  It's a little like if the original Deus Ex got drunk one night and knocked up Shantae &amp; The Pirate's Curse, nine months later this red headed, freckle faced mix of both games pops out as an indie game available on Steam for twenty bucks.  That Deus Ex comparison isn't unwarranted either. Dex is a full blown RPG with action elements, instead of an action RPG like Deus Ex Human Revolution. You suck at everything until you level that skill up, or get a specific augmentation to enhance it.  For example: Do you want to carry shotguns and SMGs into battle and fire them with pinpoint accuracy?  Better save up your skill points then!  Want to be able to lock pick almost every single locked door in the game not problem?  Grind your exp and then level the ♥♥♥♥ up!  Want to be able to coerce pimps into lending you their fanciest male hookers for a kinky bang-time at a discount?  Level up your charisma, pick the right choice during dialogue, and have fun you perverted freak!  Speaking of which, yes there's a dialogue system in Dex! Even if you have maxed out charisma you need to pick the way way of coercing someone at the time. Some people respond to threats, others respond to bribes, and others respond to flattery. Pick the wrong one, and you'd best reload a save and try again buddy!   It works well, and always keeps conversations tense as you need to always pay attention to what they say.   The writing itself is very well done and descriptive, kinda reminds me of the old cRPGs of yesteryear. The dialogue is also voice acted and...... here's where Dex starts to fall apart.  The voice actors aren't bad at all and always suit the character and role their playing, but the actual voice direction itself leaves something to be desired. It always seems like they took only one take for each line and it can sound extremely amateurish and awkward at times. You can turn voices off in the option screen of the main menu if you wish, but then during cutscenes they'll be completely silent except for the bombastic (and rather nice i might add) score blasting over stock still images.  While we're on the bad side of this i'll also add that some sound effects in general just seem to be completely ♥♥♥♥ing missing or non-existent! For example during the game you can sneak up on some unaware thugs and choke them to death, giving the same amount of exp for little to no effort as well as avoiding any possible injuries, but they make no sound! The chick you play as just dry humps them for a moment and they fall dead, again with absolutely no noise to accompany it, not even when the body falls down.  If i sneak up on someone and snap their bloody neck in a video game, i expect to hear a sickening *CRACK* to go along with the action, it's just plain unnerving when it doesn't.  Another thing wrong is the control scheme for both the controller and the keyboard and mouse. Some keys are just in a weird unnatural spot!   'Q' to dodge during melee??? Who was the pants on head ♥♥♥♥♥♥ who chose THAT brilliant key placement?  And i have never played a game, that had these few actual commands to input, that has forced me to use the '~' key.  Also the jumping has some weird form of gravity that drops if you don't hold in spacebar until you fully finish the jump. If you let go too earlier be prepared to drop like a sack of bricks.  The devs have patched the game so that you can rebind keys, so props to them, but this should have been thought out more clearly from the start.  There are also a few visual glitches here and there, and some that really hinder the gameplay like the journal getting confused and ♥♥♥♥ing up.   I guess it sounds like i really hate the game, but it's the opposite. There is a brilliant game here buried underneath some confusing design choices.  While stealth is aggravatingly basic (walk behind someone and press a button to insta-kill) the actual melee combat is simple but satisfying and deep, with a basic one two punch combo, dodging, blocking, and special moves unlocked the more points you put into the fighting skill.  Plus if you don't feel like getting your hands dirty you can always pull out a great big ♥♥♥♥ing magnum revolver and empty it into someones cranium as fast as you can pull the trigger. Skill points in the guns skill also unlock more weapons that you able to use, as well as reducing accuracy, recoil and stuff like that.  Like previously mentioned there are other skills you can upgrade such as:  Endurance Hacking Lockpicking Charisma and a few more  Hacking plays a key role in the story of Dex, and as such, has it's own mini-game dedicated to it. Without going into it too much it's fun, encourages thoroughness and skill, and never gets tedious or unwelcome.  There is also an abundance of side-quests and the most that i have encountered are well done, with good writing, always worth the effort for the cash ( or other bonuses reward ), as well as having some various options of how exactly to complete them.  I won't go into the story as i generally believe that the story in a game can fall apart if you know too much beforehand. Believe me when i say it IS worth your time.  All in all, Dex is worth the time of any patient RPG fan. Especially those with a massive throbbing hard-on for cyberpunk such as myself, and ESPECIALLY those who are looking for something akin to the original Deus Ex. Even with all the problems i mentioned.  Is it perfect? No, Mia Khalifa isn't perfect either but you can bet that if she was willing i'd jump her bones like a starving hound!  Worth every penny.",

The only niggling problem is that it uses a savepoint system.  The game itself is very, very nice. I like it a lot. Good characters, good stories (BioFarm's subplot was quite well made - especially for the bit where I started thinking 'hey, they're the good guys here... that can't be right.'.).   One of my doubts about the game was because it looked a bit like an arcade platformer. It's not. It's definitely an RPG in a 2D side scrolling world, with a few platforms.  This sort of game often has a lot of issues because of its very non-linear approach to mission playing and solving. I've run into surprisingly few of those. Sure, it's not perfect, it is sometimes confusing, but it also lets you go (almost) anywhere from the start. I like that a lot. It feels more like a world than a game (once you're let loose in it, that is.).  I've had a lot of fun with the game, thanks Dreads. :)",

After the patch this game got a lot better and made me happy to have supported it.",

            "review_text": "I wasn't sure what to think about this game when I first discovered it. The preview videos showed what looked like a very exciting game, one that caters to my interests, but the reviews were highly mixed. I chalk it up to two possible reasons. One, people might have been playing a buggier, early version, and two I think this game caters to a certain demographic.  I played the post-May 22nd version, 2.0.2.4, I believe. While it still has some bugs, they weren't anything too distracting, showing up in only a couple of spots.  As for the demographics, I grew up on games like Flashback on the original Playstation. When I saw this game, that was the first game to come to mind. I highly enjoyed Flashback; it's one of the few games that I played through on each difficulty level. For those who like Flashback, I highly recommend this game. It has much of the same mechanics and feel, as a side-scrolling sci-fi with a compelling story line.  This game also conjurs up memories of Abuse. The game's choice to shoot with the mouse and move with the keyboard mimics Abuse, but only in cyberspace can you do both at the same time.  And, finally, there's Beneath A Steel Sky. These games share themes, and perhaps quantity of dialog.  Speaking of dialog, this game's hired top notch voice actors. The woman who voiced Miranda is incredible, in my opinion. Though, there are certain points where the actors didn't know how to pronounce some of the words, and I don't think that was intentional.  The graphics are fantastic, if you like this style. It fits right at home with the aformentioned games in that regard. Dex's animations are very fluid. The music is great, and was never annoying. The muisc would change as you got into a combat situation ala Flashback.   Probably the thing I least liked about this game was the ending. But, I had enjoyed playing so much that I can't dock it too many points. It wasn't the goal, but the journey that I liked, and that is as much as anything the mark of a good game.",

What surprised me most was how well the NPCs are written, most of them are some kind of crazy and convincingly at that. Gameplaywise it's Deus Ex 2D - almost every area has several ways to get through and invites to explore. Depending on how you choose your skills and augments, this game may become a shooter, brawler or stealth game, but its focus lies on story so don't expect unending action. The amount of content seemed just enough to not get stale, took me about 20h for a thorough playthrough. The game was quite bug ridden (including a game breaking savegame bug) but the worst of them were fixed recently, so maybe give it a second chance, I certainly didn't regret a second.",

            "review_text": "TL;DR: It's pretty good. The cyberpunk theme is great, the characters are interesting and the narrative is not poorly-written, the soundtrack is lovely and very remiscent of old-school cyberpunk, and the combat, while a bit clunky, isn't expressly awful. If you're into action-RPGs and platformers and dig cyberpunk settings, check it out. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ It's difficult to look at  Dex  and not think of other, well-established examples of cyberpunk fiction. Harkening back to the old '80s and '90s aesthetic, the  Blade Runner  and  Deus Ex  inspirations are almost immediately apparent in both the visual style and gameplay progression that  Dex  takes and, when it it adheres to its inspirations, it is all the stronger because of that.   Dex  is a 2D action-RPG with platforming elements and a heavy emphasis on freedom of choice. While not nearly as open as the aforementioned  Deus Ex ,  Dex  should feel familiar to veterans in more ways than simply by name. Punching, shooting, stealthing, hacking, and sometimes even talking are all viable solutions to the problems that the player is presented with throughout the course of the game, and in the style of older RPGs  Dex  takes a hard line at encouraging players to be the master of a single aspect or two rather than a Jack of all trades. While it wouldn't be impossible to play the game trying to evenly level your stats, there's high potential for making things more complicated than they need to be by doing so.  The game features both melee and ranged combat, though neither are as refined as they possibly could be. Punching feels stiff and limited as it roots Dex, the player character, to the ground for the duration of the attacking animation. It's fairly easy and smooth to transition into a dodge roll (by using the right analog stick; as I didn't use mouse &amp; keyboard controls I unfortunately won't be able to inform on them) or blocking, but the complete lack of control combined with an auto-step that Dex does while punching makes melee combat take a while to get used to. Ranged combat, at least with a controller, doesn't fare much better, as aiming guns with the analog sticks is an exercise in extreme frustration. It's not something I would recommend trying while in the middle of a pitched fight, ironically, though I have the sneaking suspicion that it would be much easier to do with the mouse &amp; keyboard controls.  Hacking is also a central gameplay mechanic. Dex can enter Cyberspace at any time by clicking down the left analog stick on the controller, or into mission-specific networks by finding computers around the game world. While in Cyberspace, the game changes into something of a twin-stick shooter, and unfortunately the control here isn't amazing either. You get a health bar, called Focus, and an Energy bar that is utilized for moving faster or using special attack software that you can find and use throughout the game, not unlike spell books in a fantasy RPG. But, unlike most twin-stick shooters I've played on the PC, Dex doesn't automatically fire while aiming in Cyberspace, and instead you need to hold a trigger button in addition. This doesn't sound like much of an inconvenience, but what seemed to be something like input or reception lag between turning and the fire rate while in Cyberspace made the entire experience feel incredibly grating and tiring. Leveling the hacking stat and discovering the Pulsewave software (switching through different software abilities can be done by pressing Left or Right on the controller D-Pad after you have multiple abilities) were boons for my playthrough and made it much more tolerable, though it also made me wish the hacking had simply been balanced more like that from the very beginning.  I won't touch much on the story. It's nothing too new, but it does take a few interesting turns and it was compelling enough for me to follow it through without feeling bored. The characters are all fairly well-realized and given distinct personalities, and near enough every character you can interact with is one who is important for a side-quest. It's worth noting that the game has a large number of side-quests, most of which can be finished as soon as you're set loose on the city or ignored completely in favor of simply going through the (comparitively short) main quest. A few of the side-quests seemingly end without any hard conclusion upon completion, but the game actually accounts for that with something of a time-shift that occurs before the player starts the final 'chapter', during which time the player can see new incidental environmental effects or follow up on what happened with specific characters. It's a nice touch, and one I wasn't personally expecting.  The soundtrack is also worth noting. As with the rest of the game, it pulls a lot of inspiration from older cyberpunk fiction. It's the type of familiar that is just different enough to evoke nostalgic feelings without being something old itself, and it fits the thematic setting phenomenally. Unfortunately there isn't anything particularly memorable, but for the size of the development team it's still an impressive accomplishment (a sentiment I extend to the game as a whole).",

            "review_text": "Sidescoller cyberpunk rpg. In 2015? Credit for audacious anachronism, if nothing else. IF this game had been made in the mid 90's, it would likely have been successful. 20 years later... I still had a great time.   There will inevitably be comparisons to Deus Ex, and with a certain amount of validity. Being cyberpunk, Dex shares a lot of plot and thematic similarites. Even in how the game is played shares a lot in common -- missions have mutliple approaches, character traits can can be customized per playstyle, and missions and story elements branch depending on player choices. But in the 90's, that's how we played games. Especially anything wanting to call itself an RPG. It wasn't just a matter of picking which color you want at the end game. If you wanted, you could go back and pick different branches and see what outcomes were offered. To that end, Dex succeeds quite well. I felt like I was back in my parents' den poking around on the 486. Fortunately, no Dos4GW or Gravis TSR's to fight with.  The graphics and music and voice acting are quite well done. The writing is better than a lot of games, as well. As a sidescroller or action game, Dex doesn't really stand out. But as a story driven rpg, and especially if you're nostalgic for the days when cyberpunk was the future, or if you're curious to what the previous generation of gamers grew up with, it's definitely worth a shot.",

Love the top-down shooter hacking interface. Love the easy stealth/take-down aspect.  If you love these things as well, you really need to give 'DEX' a try.  Just be wary of some things: 1) Playing the game with the Xbox 360 controller is fine for the general gameplay. But when making the transition from general gameplay to the Cyberspace/AR interface, make sure you have a trusty keyboard nearby. 2) The gunplay function can be your friend or your enemy. Train yourself with the controls, particularly when using a controller. You may even find that your fists work more efficiently over any gun you come across. 3) Be wary of your surroundings. Everything with a health bar or blinking light could, and probably will, kill you. 4) Mature content. Expect ANYTHING a back alley would normally have.

One portion of the update screen also requires meticulous placing of your cursor to keep the skill description showing, but that's only a minor nuisance.  Some of the reviews still on may mention bugs but the game was patched several times in the weeks after its release, and I haven't yet ran into anything myself.  TL;DR: You like the setting and the genre, get it and enjoy it!",

            "review_text": "A solid game for scratching that action-rpg itch. Strong overall theme.  It has a strong story but allows significant freedom to roam around avoiding the main plot as well. It does have a limited amount of enemies though; no respawning, so eventually you'll run out of non-main plot things to do if you're putting it off. The economy / character skill progression feels balanced, with the beginning being hardest and the game getting a bit easier overall as your character gets more skills and equipment. Even skills like barter and lockpicking are useful though, with the lack of respawning enemies or loot. This said, I've ended the game twice with a few thousand money unspent each time.  Pacing / length to complete also feels like it's in the right place, but I've been a completionist with it. Rushing through would make the game MUCH harder and shorter. The world itself is not all that large, but none of the areas feel like filler. It took me roughly 15 hours to complete the first time, and 9 hours the second time around (knowing exactly where to go and how the combat system works speeds things up a lot).  Combat is good overall. Some quirks make things difficult at times, though. Guns feel awkward to use. When you use one, your screen jerks quickly in the direction you're facing and you get a targeting cursor to shoot with. Moving at all breaks this. Moving the cursor to aim behind you rapidly jerks the screen the other way. God help you if you have to aim at something near your character or directly above.  Melee combat feels fluid and well thought out. Enemies attack with set attacks that each have ways to dodge or block them while still getting some hits of your own in. Hacking / AR combat (with the skill point spent to use it on human targets) starts slow and a little awkward, but after upgrades makes you able to easily take down opponents with little risk.   The story, the music and the art. These three things combine to make an excellent experience. Most areas have music unique to them to help set the mood for that area, and it works well. The crowded city areas also have background city noise that gives it a crowded city feel without overpowering the music or sound effects. The art for each area is distinct as well, and you won't see the same set pieces reused over and over.   Issues: There were two areas that were incredibly frustrating and required many re-loads the first time around. They were both optional side quests. One featured a devilish jumping puzzle, and the other a timed escape with most exits suddenly blocked. Losing on the second one meant losing all progress in that area, which meant if you spent half an hour killing all the enemies there, and then failed to get out in time, that was all gone. There was a point where the main plot would not advance quite properly. You had to find information in a computer for the story, but for it to actually move on, you had to also make sure to find all the useless information in addition to the good stuff.  Ranged combat is the only other issued I've had with the game, and I already went into detail on that.  Overall, I found it to be a very enjoyable game and well worth the $20 asking price.",

            "review_text": "A solid game well worth the time, but falling short of star status. The basics: Your character can stealth and fight in the real world in this 2d platformer with rpg elements, or she can jump into cyberspace and fight in a top-down geometry-war-esque point and shoot.  The story drops you right in without explanation, which makes sense for the story, but that continues for the rest of the game. See my cons.  The Good: Interesting story, characters, most everything except your character is voice acted, and there are different ways to go about your goals. Fighting has enough diversity and movesets that I looked forward to nearly every enemy I faced. A solid and enjoyable 2D Platformer with many modern perspectives on issues.  The Bad: Well, that lack of explanation goes throughout the game. There are tons of items, most of which have no use, are just money in another form. There were apparently extra abilities I could use in Cyberspace, but I could not find a helpfile nor in-game explanation of how to switch to them. (For other players, I'm talking about the non-consumable abilities, like spammer and arc. I did see the keys for shockwave and datashield.) And the finale demanded I play in a particular way. This lack of choice was frustrating - I had avoided guns in the game, getting by on melee and stealth - now I HAD to use guns. So instead of loving the finale, I spent my time dying, swearing, and replaying.  Overall: An enjoyable game that is worth the money. The studio is poised to do great things; I am glad I supported them.  Feedback for Devs:  Gun drawing breaks the fluidity of combat. Take a look at that. Consider more guidance on what items need to be kept, and what have no use. Provide an attack for after you've knocked the legs out from under someone. They are on the ground, they should be vulnerable. Instead the only melee attack I could do was to keep knocking them down for 1 to 2 damage. Take a look at those extra cyberspace ability disks. Yeah the wedges is useful, but it got stale by the end. I wish I could have used the spammer and arc. Maybe it's simply a misunderstanding on my part, but I did look for ways to use them. Choosing lockpicking as the first ability is a bit OP. I bypassed so many areas, and got really disconnected from the main story.",

Overal I find this game extremely enjoyable, so my critique is more to help the dev team by giving them some pointers to go by.  The Excellent: Graphics are beautifully done, they remind me of space quest and flashback, which is a very good thing.  Exploration is great, allowing for you to return to most places you have been later on if you wanted to do further investigation  The Good: Music is passable, nothing spectacular, but the soundtrack fits the mood of the environments in the game.  The story is intriguing, however some names are rather cookie cutter - for example 'Decker' is super stereotypical for a hacker.  Voice Acting is ok in places, and in others it is just bad. Credit can be given that for an indie style game the characters are varied, but some of the dialogue is very contrived and some actors are doing accents they aren't particularly good at.  The Lackluster:  Stealth is very difficult, could use some tweaks here and there. Almost impossible to sneak up on someone because the range of view is so small. Enemies can almost always see you as soon as you see them, preventing you from anticipating and taking cover. I have no stealth augs yet, so this may change, but I doubt it.  The AR hacking system seems disjointed from the rest of the game, sure you can interact with the game world via cyberspace, however the 'virus' mechanic isn't particularly fun.",
