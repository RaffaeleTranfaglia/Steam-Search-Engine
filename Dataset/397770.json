Not the best graphics, simple but lovely storyline and gives some different activities to break it up every now and then. Easy enough to play and you won't have to think very hard :) I definitely suggest giving it a go if you like these sorts of games and if you aren't sure you want to pay for it, you can download from the website for an hour trial,  I'm glad I picked it up in a special as I wouldn't pay much for it (much too short) but otherwise I had a good time playing and wasting some time (have already finished the game).",

If you want a casual tappy tappy screen time game... then this is for you, bur for those of us that enjoy a nice long strategy game with multiple ways to build and create, not so much.  Graphics are ok, for a tablet or something, but only allows for a fullscreen resolution... I have a widescreen.   Gameplay is very linear. Tappy screen, and watch for blinky flashy thingy.  TLDR; casual game, not strategy game.",
