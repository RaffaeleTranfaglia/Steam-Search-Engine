            "review_text": "This is a good game and in its own right is a complete experience.   Story is good.   Feels balanced.   That said, I think this game could have been a great game with more work. Ultimately the units are expendable with only limited rewards for keeping them alive. I spent the whole first campaign painstakingly choosing my units lives over timed quest rewards, which the rewards are valuable later while once the units maxed out, swap leveling up other units from the researve. Ultimately saving your units to me feels to no gain. The units max out very quickly at level 5. The heros contenue to grow and level, which makes it more appealing to use them for the slaughters. By the time you really finish the campaign, which seems to come after 10 missions or so you lose all of them to start a new campaign. In the end, you will have access to them in the alliance campaign again where all your surviving units and heroes will be of service again with all the artifacts you discovered.   Hoping they make a second game with more missions, more story, and more custom units with higher level caps.",

            "review_text": "Like orge battle but without anyone play testing it. I got up to one level where I had about 3 turns to make it to a castle or else I lose the level. I couldn't make it within 3 turns so I turned the game play down to easy. It made the board harder. Also you do not get enough gold to replace units so I was doing A LOT of reloading saves. Lastly the enemy units regenerate all their health after one turn it seems. So if you wanted to kill anything you had to do it all in one turn. Pretty bad game. I got it in a bundle and I wasted a few hours playing it. Would not suggest wasting your time with this.",

Walk away from this game now and act like you never knew it existed.",
