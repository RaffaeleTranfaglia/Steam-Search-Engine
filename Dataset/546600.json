            "review_text": "So I have only played a few matches in this game, and I will likely continue to play it but it feels as though it should be in early access (or clearly stated that it is in early beta), to better set expectations for potential players. Here's why:  - there are currently only 3 classes - it feels like common options such as graphics/key binding settings and various other UI elements are lacking or non-existent - there is currently zero progression in the game  The game as a result feels very un-finished. Definitely not a bad thing, but for the sake of attracting potential players, setting expectations is important.  Other than that, it looks to have great potential. I hope that it continues to develop!",
