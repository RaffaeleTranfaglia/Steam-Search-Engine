            "review_text": "My first review here on Steam so I'll try to be as fair and to the point as possible.  Blade Arcus is the latest addition to SEGA's long running 'Shining' RPG series but this time, we skip all of the hours of gameplay and grinding to progress the story for more simplier system......let's turn this franchise into a 'FIGHTER'.....someone at SEGA must have said that and 'poof', it's done.  The game story revolves around it's two original characters Ryuuga &amp; Pairon. As to what that story is? I don't know....I have yet to play story mode and quite frankly, I don't care much for it. I play fighting games for the fighting, not the story (majority of the game). If it was animated and you had to watch it like a movie like in Guilty Gear Xrd (Sign &amp; Revelator), then I'll probably know what the story is cause I'll watch it in a heartbeat. Just know that there is a story to this game that is only relavent to this game and not any of the other Shining games that never made it here to the west:  - Shining Tears - Shining Wind - Shining Hearts - Shining Blade  There's a lot more games in the series than what I posted but I'll keep it short for right now.  Blade Arcus sports 16 characters of whom all are from various Shining games that I just mentioned above with Ryuuga &amp; Pairon making their Shining debut in this one. Consider this game more of a dream match to put some of the fan favorite characters the Shining series against one another. Outside of Shining Force 1 &amp; 2, I'm only familiar with Dylan, Rick, Rouna, Misty, &amp; Xiaomei from Shining Hearts due to the anime series. Each character is unique and there isn't really a carbon copy character in this game although one may realize that Ryuuga &amp; Pairon are basically your Ryu &amp; Ken (Street Fighter) staples of this game.....to some degree.  Keep in mind that Blade Arcus is 'NOT' an airdasher anime fighting game. This game is slow paced which is could be similar to Koihime Enbu or Samurai Showdown but with a borrowed mechanic from Guilty Gear (which I will get into). The game sports a 2 vs 2 gameplay style where you pick any two characters where one will be your primary and the second will be your support character. You're able to switch roles of your characters in between rounds if you need a change of pace &amp; strategy. Your secondary character is your assist character to whom you can all out 'a la Marvel vs. Capcom' but there is a catch. You have an assist gauge that has 4 marks which indicate an assist level. Depending on when &amp; how you call assist (Pressing D alone will make your assist do an assist attack depending on the situation you're in. Pressing D with an attack button will make your assist do an attack depending on the strengh attack you use.....which also counts to how much meter they'll use). You gain assist meter by taking damage or defending otherwise, it will fill 'VERY' slowly if you're offensive. Offensive or Defensive.....the choice of how you use your meter is up to you and can determine the flow of a match. As for the borrowed Guilty Gear mechanic, there is one which is pretty much a 'Roman Cancel'....that is, a mechanic that allows you to cancel a normal or special move animation to continue a combo. This mechanic is known as 'Offensive Force' and consumes 1 whole super meter to use (so you get a total of 3).  Seeing as this is the first official western release of Blade Arcus, it's best you know that this game was ported to the Playstation 3 &amp; 4 back in November of last year with extras like Arena Mode (arcade), an art gallery, and a stylish mechanic for those of you who are casual fighting game players or don't play fighting games at all. These modes &amp; mechanics did NOT make it into the Steam release of this game. The reason for this is because the game was developed using the 2.01 arcade build as the basis. As to how Arena mode didn't make into this release, we don't know but evidently, this is a deal breaker for some people along with not having the art gallery. Degica Games is currently trying to see if Team Saisenzen will add them to the game but realize that it's Team Saisenzen that makes the final decision as their the publishers of this version, not Degica Games &amp; not SEGA. Degica Games is only playing the advisor &amp; EN PR role for Blade Arcus on Steam.  One of the key modes that was missing from the PS3/PS4 version of the game was Online mode which is exclusively made by Team Saisenzen for the Steam release. I'll admit, upon release of the game, playing online was straight garbage....I mean slow as molasses matches hindered this game like no tomorrow. Fortunately, after one day of release, there has been a update that addresses this issue and so far, I've experienced smooth online matches from various players and even those from Japan so right now, online play is pretty decent. This experience may be different for everyone else so please be aware that my experience my differ from yours.  Now......is this game worth getting? That's hard to say because I don't know how some of you think when it comes to fighting games. For me, this was a good purchase and it also shows my support for Degica Games &amp; Team Saisenzen but also it shows my support for hoping that more games in the Shining series would be considered for the west if this game does good. If you're into slower paced fights, no out of control combos, no airdashing (the only exception is Rouna), &amp; not many confusing mechanics to remember (at least in my book) then this game may be up your alley. If you're looking for more frantic fighting gameplay, you may want to steer clear. I would advise that you watch some videos of this game before you decide to purchase it if this type of gameplay is not your cup of tea. It's an enjoyable game to play to say the least.  :: PROS :: - First game in YEARS from the Shining series to come to the western market - Only version of the game that has Online Play - Slow paced matches with simple mechanics (gameplay similar but mixed with Koihime Enbu, Samurai Showdown, Guilty Gear) - Sonia is unlocked (so no DLC for this game at the moment) - Features character designs by Tony Taka - Good soundtrack  :: CONS :: - Slow paced matches may turn off people who are into games like Guilty Gear, Melty Blood, Under Night In-Birth EXE|Late - Missing console features not included in this version (Arena Mode, Art Gallery, Stylish (casual) gameplay mechanic) - Features character designs by Tony Taka (Hey, there are actually people out there who hates his artwork so I have to cater to them too)",
