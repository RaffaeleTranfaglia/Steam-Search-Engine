            "review_text": "(I’m not a huge fan of first person shooter games in general so keep that in mind when reading this review) Okay, first off, this game is WAY too short. The campaign took me only 4 hours to complete on normal difficulty (even with me dying and re-spawning every few minutes) If you are going to charge $20 for a game, make it a bit longer than 4 hours.  Despite having a short campaign, I had a lot of fun playing this game. It has a wide variety of fun to use assault rifles, submachine guns, sniper rifles, and not to mention goliath-the resistances armored vehicle that you control with a targeter.  The graphics are sub-par even for a game made in 2011. On many cases I had to lean closer to my monitor to see if it was an enemy I was aiming at or just a stray piece of garbage.  I have nothing to say about the multiplayer mode as I have not played it but I might update my review after I have played it.  Regardless of the short story and the lacking visuals, I enjoyed this game, but I wouldn’t buy it until it goes on sale or the price goes down. However if you are looking for a fun first person shooter game that won’t kill your computer, Homefront is a very good option  I give this game a respectable 7/10.",

I do agree that the story was a bit too short at only about five hours long. I still enjoyed the story based on its premise. With the USA being so high and mighty recently it is nice to see it being a hollow broken shell of itself. The look and feel of the game's atmosphere was very Red Dawn (the original 1980s movie) to me. Most of the characters where one dimensional and shallow but they do their jobs well. The game play is well complaint and works but parts of the game are very hand holding and scripted. With a sequel on the horizon it will be interesting to see what happens with this well thought out but not quite well executed world.",

            "review_text": "I played this game back on the 360 near it's release, and I can say I still do love it. Alot of reviews here are saying that the story is boring and not very long, and that's true it is very crap but the main part of the game is the multiplayer. The core parts of the multiplayer are the same as any other shooter, but the things that make it stand out are the battle point system, vehicles and an interesting gamemode. The battle point (BP) system gives you points every time you get a kill, assist or capture a point, these points are used to buy you kill streak like things such as an RPG, drones, helicopters, tanks, ect. The other thing is the gamemode, battle commander (BC), this game mode can be attached to other gamemodes (TDM - TDM (BC)) to mix things up a little. On battle commander the more kills you get during your life gets to placed as a 'priority threat', this makes your general area on the map visable for a couple players and gives them extra Battle Points for killing you. The more people you kill the highier the priority you are, this also means your general area has been shown to more people and the more points they get for killing you, also each time you go up in priority you also get a boost of some kind, such as a UAV and increased health, this helps you rise highier in the priority. The last time I played Homefront was around a month ago and the player count was around 15-32 at times, the amount fluctuates alot and most people are only on one server at certain times. I still recommend this game but I would wait until a sale and only if you're happy to wait for players to come on.",

As somebody who payed 5 dollars for the game, I feel as if it was worth that much, and maybe a bit more if i tried the multiplayer.   Homefront isn't bad, but it's not really that unique in the mechanics department, so overall 5/10 'It's Average' pick it up on sale if really interested.",

Storyline seeeeeems as thought it could be deep, but I've still not played enough of it to tell. Few bugs with the AI, waypointing and such, but playable.   I only played one or two multiplayer matches before it stopped working for me, I've reinstalled and done the whole deal, but it still doesn't let me spawn in multiplayer matches.

That being said, this game does have it's merits.   The concept of itself is both brilliantly created and masterfully implimented as the story, like 'Freedom Fighters' shows a conflict outside of the generic us vs arabs conflict, and puts the war on american soil in the defensive. The explanation is deep and intricate, and in many ways almost feasible, but even there isn't where this game truly shines.  The game juxtapositions the ideals of two of your partners, emotional vs mechanical, against each other in a way that makes the player question his actions. It also forces him to experience the backlash of 'heroic actions' as negative effects most games leave out. Consequences for actions is a recurrant theme, and is artfully displayed within.",

Earning experience, leveling up, increasing your arsenal, and unlocking new infantry abilities (read: perks) is satisfying, and the maps allow a decent range of viable battlefield strategies.

            "review_text": "Homefront is a game with a wonderfully executed story, but it does have some annoying quirks in its gameplay.  For one, the game felt like another generic shooter, with no real unique twist. The Goliath system could be called one, but I personally found it annoying to have to switch back to it every time I wanted to fire (this was because once you fire with it you automatically put the targeter away). Some levels, especially the early missions, had portions where there was either too much cover, which essentially forced close quarters combat with long range rifles, and areas with too little cover, which stopped me from progressing as I had to find a place to go prone, get up, fire a few rounds, take enough rounds to almost die from enemies I couldn't see, and then go prone for my health to regenerate.   The controls also left a bit to be wanted as well. I was suprised to see that aim-down-sight is locked to toggle only, and can't be changed to hold to aim-down-sight. The helicopter controls were extremely dumbed down (even on the highest difficulty control level) and there were so many controls for the helicopter that were just completely un-realistic (i.e. you can pitch straight down or straight up and not gain/lose velocity and rolling the helicopter didn't actually give sideways velocity).  The weapons in the game also were a bit of a bad point for me because, other than a sniper rifle and a rocket launcher, they all felt the same. The shotgun was completely useless for the CQC areas that you get it for because the enemies are always too far away to hit without getting gunned down. The assault rifles and the LMG all felt the same and none had a specific scenario where it would be better than the other (I generally found myself using either the LMG or the Scar LMG since it had the most ammo and biggest clip), with the only diference being some rifles were full-auto, some were burst fire, and some were semi-auto. I also found the movement speed reduction while aiming was a bit annoying, and only really see it making sense with the LMG or the RPG.  The AI is also kind of strange. Hostile AI can sometimes hit you even if you are behind cover, and they really only target you, the player, with your AI allies taking fire rarely. Speaking of the AI allies, they are all but useless. When they aren't sitting crouched behind cover for entire firefights, they will randomly fire, sometimes in the direction of hostiles. I found that the allies worked best as spotters since they had a habit of firing at walls that hostiles were taking cover behind, and they don't stop firing at the one specific enemy they are targeting until it is killed, usually by the player.  The game's story was a great one though, and I really enjoyed the dark turns the game took in the labor camp levels, I just wish the game would have spent more time showing the Korean oppression. The story alone is the main reason I recommend this game, with its gameplay only being on par with other first person shooters of its time.",

But it's not old school Splinter Cell requiring you to constantlly hide and take down one guy at a time. Asymmetrical warfare yes.  Recommend. Fun story, decent game play.",

Also, the campain itself was short as hell (only 4 hours on normal difficuly, and that includes dying a bunch of times). That being said, the best part about the game in my opinion is the multiplayer which is a mix of both call of duty and battlefield. Its like call of duty in the way that you can go duck around shooting and killing and its very faced paced, and it is like battlefield in the sense that there are multiple game modes, vehicules, big map sizes, and tactic opportunities. I paid 4,99$ for the game, and at that price, it is a MUST buy for shooter fans or casual gamers. Even tough the game is from 2011, it looks beutifull on Ultra settings even with today's standarts. I'd rate it a 9 out of 10. It would have been a 10 if the campain was a little bit better. So what are you waiting for? Get this game now.",

If you really want to play Homefront, try Homefont on the console (which has more playes) or wait for Homefront 2 instead (and wish it has more players), but if you want a good team based multiplayer FPS with weapon customization and lots of players on PC, try Call of Duty or Battlefield instead,",

But recklessness will be punished by RPGs, among other counters.  - Almost every weapon is viable in some way, so choosing one comes down to personal preference.   Dislikes:  - The Express 870 Shotgun. Can one-shot in close quarters, has a quick refire rate, and has a disturbing effective range.  - No active repairs for vehicles, only the 'Monkey Wrench' passive perk. And that's the  very last unlock.   - No 'zoom' feature for your minimap; it's fixed at a relatively close zoom. Your full map can be viewed quickly using a single button, but still.

Design like this in the shadow of this entire game, nearly beginning to end. The introduction is great, but the gameplay feels like you're kinda floating around in space, struggling to follow NPCs' instructions from one White Castle to next advertisement.  I can't, however, decide if whether or not I regret playing it....",

            "review_text": "I wanted to like this game... This is a review of the campaign. I can say this: The graphics are good, it runs well, the story is believable (almost), and it's certainly action packed, full of big explosions. But sadly it's let down by far too many things for me to reccomend it:  First and foremost is that I feel so bored after completing the campaign that the very idea of even trying multiplayer makes me feel like I should do something more productive with my time... Pull a lump of wax out of my ear, pick my nose, or scratch my nuts or something...   You just play 'follow the leader' for 90% of the campaign. Deviating from the leaders course is unrewarding/pointless, and in some cases causes the mission to restart.  4 hours to complete, and the first 3 hours was at best: 'meh'. The final hour of gameplay I was sort of starting to enjoy it. Stockholm syndrome maybe. Then it was over.  Lacklustre animations, people sliding sideways without their feet moving, or running but not going anywhere (enemy soldier stuck at the top of the stairs for instance), wheels on vehicles that turn too slowly for the speed the vehicle is moving at...  Special effects from two different games: explosions and the resulting fireballs look brilliant. Get stuck in an area where most of the scenery is on fire though and it's a different story... Running through a burning shop I noticed 'fires' that looked like they came straight out of a game from 15 years ago.  Ambient occlusion? Turn it off, it looks like lego land smoke on everything that gets close to another surface. Turning it off didn't make a noticeable difference to the general look of the game, but did get rid of the horrible blocky smoke around everything.  All the guns handle the same with nothing to distinguish them besides the scope stuck on top (of which you can choose 3 varieties of acog scope, and 3 varieties of red dot sight). Whether it be an SMG, LMG or assault rifle; recoil is non existant (with the exception of the two sniper rifles, but they auto center after each shot making the recoil pretty much pointless on them).  There's a heli flying section in the game that is absolutely dire, it shouldn't be in the game at all but part of the story is you're a heli pilot... Unfortunately whoever designed the heli section of the game had absolutely no idea of what a helicopter actually is... You basically fly a magical hovering cannon that can bounce off everything, including cliffs, trucks, enemy tanks etc. You can point the nose of the heli at the ground and not go anywhere...  Then there's bugs, invisible walls, not being able to walk through certain doors when they're open because you have to wait for the NPCs to go through first and that sort of rubbish.  Friendly NPCs who are totally invincible, soaking up hundreds of rounds of ammo and eating a few grenades to boot without so much as stumbling.  The stealth sections are atrocious, and the AI is pretty much non existant. My first warning of this was when I nearly tripped over an enemy soldier after running upstairs, but he didn't notice me because apparenlty he was stone deaf and for some reason was inspecting the paintwork on a door by pressing his nose against it... I couldn't shoot him, I couldn't even raise my gun (maybe your character pitied the simple minded fool or something). Then a friendly npc walks up behind him, chatting casually, and strangles him in 1 second flat.  She then looks all sad before saying 'It never gets any easier'. I dunno love, that vulcan nerve pinch shiz you just pulled on that soldier looked pretty damn easy to me.  The sad truth is it literally couldn't be any easier: You can literally walk around in the open in broad daylight and they won't notice you unless you are directly in front of them.  One time a friendly NPC (yeah, same one) went to kill a guard, in plain view of 3 other guards and a couple of prisoners, they didn't even blink. I shot someone on a tower with a silenced sniper rifle and the mission ended because I took the shot 2 seconds before I was told to. 2nd attempt, friendly NPC goes to kill the guard, I hide behind a tractor with my team until I'm told to take the shot, mission ended for no apparent reason. 3rd attempt, I stood in front of the tractor in the open between the friendly NPC and the 3 guards who don't care about their friend being choked to death behind me. Still standing in front of them I shoot the guy in the tower. Nobody cares, the mission is allowed to go on.  It doesn't feel like it's finished. BF3 in beta was a more polished experience than this tripe. Though you can see the influences of other games, the one that really stands out is CoD. This game tries so hard to be CoD, that it's almost as bad as a CoD game. CoD and Half Life had a baby, CoD smothered the baby. Half Life decided that things weren't working out and scarpered, but then CoD decided to keep and raise the afterbirth. Homefront, the mouldy placenta of FPS games is a casual shooter. Are you a casual? If you've read this far I doubt it. If you're really desperate for another generic CoD clone this might keep you entertained briefly... If you want a game that has real substance and lasting replayability, look elsewhere because this is duller than dishwater.  TLDR: Yet another generic, run of the mill CoD clone that was a chore to play... If you've got 4 hours to waste and it's 75% off, do yourself a favour and still don't buy it. Unless you're a CoD fanboy, in which case you'll probably love it. Sad, deluded fool that you are.",

CONS: -Improbable silly story. Koreans invading not only USA but many other countries? C'mon! -Campaign playtime is VERY short (3-5 hours top, depending of difficulty level) -Scripted like hell. Lots of enemies running at you until you kill that specific RPG soldier so they stop spawning! -Lots of 'invisible walls'... and door blocking lockers until lifted up by NPC. -Your running speed is like my grandpa walking speed. -Collectibles are annoying to search as your prompted from NPC's to carry on and move on to next objective.  OVERALL: That is about all that come's to mind for now and if you are slightly interested in Homefront, buy it only at a decent deal. Besides, there are plenty of wargames alternatives.

            "review_text": "Homefront was a strange experience.  I was huge into Team Fortress 2 at the time and they were giving away a copy of Metro 2033 and a hat for the Soldier class aa a pre-purchase bonus so I figured why not? It turns out I got more mileage out of the Genuine hat than either game I got out of that deal.  One has to look at the media blitz surrounding this game as an indicator that when you have people dress up as the antagonists of the game at gaming conventions and events and releasing hundreds of balloons over the Golden Gate Bridge to promote it you have to wonder if the developer is putting too many of their eggs in the basket. If you can, go look up the review PlayitBogart did of Rise of the Robots to get the gist of what I'm saying.  To the game itself now.  Homefront was not a hot mess; it played just fine and controlled like a modern FPS should despite all the difficulties I had adjusting to the keyboard and mouse after playing shooters on consoles for almost seven years prior. A lot of the high points of the game came in the first half of the campaign showcasing the cruelty of the North Koreans by having things such as piles of dead Americans being buried en masse in a baseball field or a childs parents being shot in right in front of you as you are transported on a bus. They even briefly touched on one of your companions facing racism due to the fact he was half-Korean. Surely some attempts to invoke emotion were expected in a game touching on this subject matter.  ...That's about the end of the positives however. Looking back I disliked this game for the lack of content it had and all the glaring flaws in how it tried to do what it did. For starters, all the main characters played out as pure sterotypes which for the purpose of this review I will refer to them as Jarhead, Girl, Target of Racism (TOR), and Father Figure.  You escape from a bus and turn into Dothis McPlotdrive III as you try to meet up with Jarhead's friends to try and fight back against the Koreans who were somehow able to unite almost all of East Asia and occupy an economically crippled United States. Is your immersion broken yet? Don't worry, I was somehow able to care less about the characters in this game by the end of it all. Jarhead and Girl argue constantly as you are led through the war torn suburbs to a hidden oasis where the resistance has set up a self-sufficient hide-a-way led by Father Figure.  You are then led through a night mission where you are bombarded by advertisments for actual real world companies and establishments to the point where you actualy have to fight your way through a Tiger Direct store and pass by a Hooters. I wish I was kidding. This was a design choice by the developers to try and increase the immersion but astute gamers will see this as a disturbing trend where fiction and reality break down. The same thing happened when I noticed real world ads would start appearing on billboards in Saints Row 2; it takes me out of the game and reminds me the crappy real world exists.  You go through American held lands with TOR to do something in the cornfields. I think it was to find a helicopter to escort some fuel trucks for the military to use to fight against the Koreans. The game just spirals down into oblivion after this.  The whole premise of the game is laughable at best anyway. You expect me to believe a small nation that refuses to feed it's populace would just somehow take over it's neighbors and confront the only real Superpower on the planet? Would this make more sense if the antagonists were Chinese as was originally planned? A change that was made because the devs were afraid of a people who are notorious for breaking copyright law like it's nothing and banning anything that portrays their nation in a bad light?  The worst problem I had with this game was the fact it was obvious sequel bait. When you finally get to the climax of the game you expect to confront the main bad guy that they built up all game to, only to be blue-balled by 'We are finally turning this war around' before the credits roll.  There was no follow-up until recently with Homefront: The Revolution serving as a reboot of the series, effectively making this game pointless story wise. But hopefully developers look at it as a lesson of how much high expectations can sink a company. Kaos Studios was shuttered shortly after release and according to Wikipedia shares of THQ declined by almost a quarter, ultimately leading to the demise of THQ.  Multiplayer was also a strange mix of Battlefield and Counter-strike where you fought in tug of war style battles and earned credits to purchase weapons, armor, vehicles and the like. In retrospect, it wasn't unique enough for me to continue trying to do better. I just went back to TF2 shortly after with my Genuine Hachimaki.  I could only recommend this at a steep discount or as a video playthrough. Aside from that, you didn't miss much.",

They sign the official secrets act (that's the UK name, so the USA equivalent). So either the developers have made this all up or they were taken for a ride by this 'former field agent'. In fact the whole game has the feel of having been built on shakey foundations. Where Frontlines: Fuel of War (FFOW) held together a story because it was obviously fiction, Homefront get's way too serious with it. Where a more frivolous approach could have made room for some really interesting social commentary, here the statements are so heavy handed that they come off as crass and patronising. The inclusion of children in these statements made me extremely uncomfortable. Sure, I'm sure child characters have a place somewhere in video games (one character in Freedom Fighters comes to mind, a much better try at this kind of thing) but here their inclusion just ends up feeling creepy and inappropriate. The fluid gunplay/combat that was in FFOW is, strangely, absent. Dropping to the ground and trying to use iron sights leads to game killing movement problems. The hit box for your character is wrong as well leading to use of cover being highly irritating. All in all I can see how Kaos Studios became defunct after this game.

WHILE IT LASTED!!! this game was so horably short i beat it in a day. i Know my play time says i sat in the credits for 7 mins but thats because i had no internet YESTERDAY so i played this game i got on sale at walmart for .98$. the online is totaly ♥♥♥♥ed too, evryone has rocket launchers and there REALLY OP.  but now the real question. Is it good? its ok if you have a day or two and your bored. but if watched all the trailers and thought this was a call of duty killer your wrong. and i don't recommend it  the ending of the campaign is horable to y'all die then some fuxked british guy says there will be reinforcments from brittan and then... THE ♥♥♥♥ING CREDITS!!   but this game did teach me to hate korea and 'patriots' (mrrrica!)",

I am so glad I bought this game when it was on sale for cheap, otherwise I would be even more ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off than I already am for spending $20 on a game that doesn't even work correctly!",

Other than visuals, the game is nothing much. I can't exactly describe it but i just found the game to be not fun.   It trys to be like other modern war shooters, with a sneak mission, a sniper mission, a helicopter mission, humvees, etc. But it just fails to deliver the experience. It didn't capture my attention as other war shooters therefore i rated it thumbs down.",

All the guns feel the same, the audio is generic and terrible, and the voice acting is poorly done. From what I've heard the campaign takes about 3 hours to beat. I wouldn't know because after about 30 minutes of the most abysmal game I've ever experienced, I uninstalled it.  An absolute piece of crap. Stay away from it. Spend your money elsewhere.",

The game play is really slow and there are times where I wish I could just kill my team just to move faster. Your team is not helpful at all. They can not shoot and they constantly get in the way. The enemy hit boxes are also horrible. You could have your crosshair on target and miss your shots. I would only recommend getting this game if it's on sale.",

Campaign problems aside - the declining multiplayer is probably more concerning although the BF2 style gameplay did look promising... But couldn't tell if these were hackers with aimbot or just a wall hack....  gameplay for me online was perfect, but experience just dreadful... Seriously regret buying this promising game...",

This game took me a while to even get it to start or just to not lag in the freaking main menu. Yeah so I installed the game, watched the 30FPS cutscene and then it was playing at a steady 10-15FPS. I eventually got it play at 60fps and it didn't go above even with V-Sync off. So then I walked over to the window and the game crashed, GG.   This is just a techincal review so if you can get around the performence glitches and bugs, it may actually be a decent game, but i'm still leaving a negative just because of how terrible of an experience I had with it.",

There is plenty of room to expand upon the story and the characters, but the game ends up being short lived and rushed. It feels like the game was meant to be more of a CoD replacement or competitor, but multiplayer is dead. With only a handful of people playing at any time, and usually on one server.  Taken as a game for its single-player, your greatest enemy will be the terrible friendly AI. Who have a habbit of triggering events before you know what's going on, standing around doing nothing because you are 'in their spot,' not recognizing where you even are and pushing you away(literally), or just being generaly stupid and useless.   More than a few times I would peak around a corner to take a couple shots only to have an AI suddenly come running up to where I am and pushing me the rest of the way around the corner because they wanted my cover. After all the fighting was done, there was more than one occassion also where I had trouble getting the story/events to progress because I wasn't standing on the exact spot someone was expecting me to be in order to trigger the advancement.  Over-all, a mediocre game that certainly isn't worth $5, let alone $20.",

Linear shooters can work just fine if it has good gunplay hell my favourite fps of all time is F.E.A.R and that game is very linear but in this game the gunplay is also just very mediocre, nothing about it stands out or makes it different. The bullet impact and guns feel dull and they sound dull too. It’s been done to death even back in 2011 the regenerating health, awful ai, modern setting with no colour, bland level design built around taking cover often etc. I could go on forever. I think the concept of the game saves it from being a bad game but they failed on telling a gripping story with great characters that you care for that’s for sure.  4/10 (Mediocre)",
