            "review_text": "Quell Memento is the third game in the Quell series, and is unique in several ways. Some of the things it includes with the two previous Quell games are the amazing level of polish, and the spectacular soundtrack. This game also retains the challenging puzzle aspect of the other games, but manages to add so much new content that it feels like a whole new world.  In Quell Reflect several new mechanics had been added over the original game, Quell Memento takes those mechanics and multiplies them three-fold. Adding in whole new puzzle types, and at least a half dozen new mechanics, this game is a whole new experience on the old puzzle game we’ve all grown to love.  It just takes to the second shelf before you start seeing some of the major new mechanics (Illumination), and it does not take long until you start seeing why these can be so challenging!  Another aspect new to Quell Memento, and one of its strongest components is that the game has added a sort of storyline to it. For the first time in the series the game has a voice over that talks as you reach new stages. This story helps put the entire Quell series into perspective, and gives the game a life of its own. When I first played Quell Memento I was truly touched when I reached the end.  The Quell series is truly spectacular, and I cannot recommend these games enough, Quell Memento is the final installment in the series, and if you’ve played either of the others, you owe it to yourself to pick this game up today.

            "review_text": "My 2nd Quell game. Maybe the hardest, longest of this journeys yet. It really takes time to beat it and its really challenging to find the best solutions of many levels, sometimes with 4 orbs where you need to find out when where, what to do before and what after, 1 wrong move can destroy everything. The game is really amazing, only what i miss are 5 Trading Cards and MORE steam acheivements, steps achievements for gems, pearls, time items on the way to get all, or time achievements for playing 10 min,30,60,120 or beating a level or a quater of a level, so many chances unused. For puzzle fans i give 92 %, with 50 % discount i would even give 95 %, for normal gamers that dont dislike this genre i give 77 %, for achievement hunters i give 90 % (could be more). Thx 4 reading. Hopefully enjoy.",

            "review_text": "Good puzzle game. It's actually quite difficult and has multiple additions from the first game. If you played the first one and thought it was a bit to easy and are wary of getting this one, don't worry: this one has some pretty challenging puzzles in it.   Just like the first one you collect pearls to beat the level and there's random hidden gems in blocks you'll have to smash your ball in to to get. I hate the gem thing and used a guide to get a good amount of them because I think it's stupid to have hidden stuff like that in puzzle games. I'm playing a puzzle game, not a smash my ball into every block simulator.  This game adds multiple unique ways puzzles have to be completed unlike regular quell though. -light up all the blocks to adds certain color -light up all the diamonds with your light rays -a weird gold pearl that turns your ball gold and mostly screws with level completion for various reasons -moving a red ball simultaneously with your blue ball (red balls kill) -there's hidden levels with hidden items in some levels. They follow the same unlocking procedure as the gems, so I hate them  All in all, just ignore the gems and you've got yourself a nice little puzzle game on your hands. It's very challenging at points and if you enjoy puzzle games or blue balling then this game is easily recommended for you.",
