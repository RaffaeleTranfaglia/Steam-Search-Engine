Reminds me some good-old short (yes, it is short) stories by sci-fi-theme writers (like Asimov or Lem), talking about artificial intelligence trying to evaluate themselves in some situation. Those stories were ones of my favourite. They are often in a form of a tragedy, and so this game is - creepy and sad, combined with some great black humor moments and dark surreal sci-fi background.  So I really appreciate the scenario, writings and acting, among the great decorations of abandoned location and nice ambient soundtrack. Please, support the authors, buy it and enjoy.  Yes, there are some issues common for a such type of game (adventure) like not intuitive quests. Although the solutions actually make sense (not purely random), few times during the game process I found myself clicking every interactive object and every inventory item trying to combine each one with another.",

Maybe it is not human life soil that values, but rather crops growing out of it? Maybe it is personality, creativity, devotion and honesty that matter the most? And if so - what if such crops can grow in some other soil? This game will raise some discomforting questions before those who try it. Are you able to show compassion to a machine? Can you share its pain, sorrow and despair? You do not have to, of course. You can simply cast it all away as irrelevant. Just like a primitive robot would do in your place.",

Because its 2D, there are times when you must run back and forth in levels to solve puzzles.   The action segments feel unnecessary and uninspired. Almost every action segment has you hiding behind cover waiting for the enemy to stop shooting and then proceed to shoot a few rounds before repeating the process over again. Luckily the action segments are few and are over with quickly.   The Bad:  - lack of any real graphical options  - Unless I missed it, no volume settings   Conclusion:  This is not a platformer, nor is it an action game. Its important to realize what kind of game this is. If you enjoy slow paced methodical gameplay, solving puzzles and getting yourself immersed in the atmosphere this is a great game to play.  ",

            "review_text": "In this game, you play as ARID, an AI installed in a combat suit. As you crash land into an underground cave, your pilot is injured, and you must seek medical aid in order to save his life. As you roam through the atmospheric caves and tunnels, you realize that you are not alone. Through the game, you explore the inner workings of your own morality and find a way to survive the rules and directives sautered into your mind.  The story of this game is captivating and mysterious, even humorous at times. The plot is full of spikes and twists that make you question your own involvement in the gaming experience. I found the characters to be fantasic and ever evolving. The antagonist of the story manages to seem threatening, haunting, and insane whilst still remaining under a polite and unyeilding exterior. The ending will have you shocked, amazed, and terrified at the events that have just unfolded.  The lighting and graphics of the game were very important in keeping the mysterious and dark atmosphere. The lighting and contrast of the characters and items in the game worked fantastically in mood of the plot, and added a sense of darkness to yourself and the world you inhabit.   The gameplay itself is the only place I have any quarrel. At first, the control scheme is quite difficult to get used to, but later on you will realize that is quite effective for efficiency of use. One design feature I liked was that the character was never broken, maintaining an immersive experience. Even the menu and pause screen made sense in the storyline. Another thing that kind of downed the fun of the game was it's difficulty. Some of the battles are annoying to complete, and progressing the story can be difficult at times, but both were managable.  I came into this gaming experience expecting a poorly-made game to match it's low price, but I couldn't have been more wrong. With the exeption of a few gameplay points, I was very impressed by the quality and fun this game brought. I cannot wait for the sequel.  The Fall has +1 Fan!",

In the absence of this paradigm changing game series, designers were limited to stories about the interactions of artificial intelligencies left unchecked without human supervision, their immutable protocols providing an interesting and rocky terrain over which to drape a personality that is designed to learn and adapt, but which cannot ultimately modify the landscape. I, for one, and chilled to the bone and thank the lord baby jesus every day that this never actually came to pass.

While the general play was linear, it had some room for exploration to build background for the story. Some of the puzzles were easy to navigate and solve, while others were more challenging. There were one or two that had me go back and wander around looking around wondering 'wtf, how the hell do I do this?', though overall they all gave a sense of accomplishment. I really enjoyed the story and the ideas it presented, and often had me thinking about I, Robot.  Only downsides I found were that I found it hard to play this in long sittings, and had to put time between solving the puzzles I got stuck on.  The Fall is a great game and am looking forward to potential expansions/parts in the future! 8.3/10",

            "review_text": "A really solid adventure game with some light, simple combat elements thrown in. Puzzles are interesting and well designed, generally with obvious but not immediately accessible solutions - most of them revolving around manipulating the inflexibility of an AI's brain, whether that be finding alternate ways to make a dirty room scan as 'clean' or engineering a situation that endangers your pilot in order to access emergency powers so you can save said pilot.  The writing is fun and snappy, alternating between grim exposition and dark, borderline silly humour. Exposition is minimal, leaving the player to puzzle out for themselves what the real plot might be. Even with only a few interactions between them, each of the three main characters has their own clearly distinct personality, and the differences between them and their attitudes towards what it means to be an AI are interesting to watch.  (Very) minor niggles with movement and controlling the protagonist's gun aside, definitely worth picking up if you're at all interested in a sci-fi adventure game with some strong horror elements. Eagerly looking forwards to the next instalment.",

            "review_text": "A fascinating sci-fi adventure game with great writing and a rare example of excellent indie game voice acting.   You play as an artificial intelligence on board a fancy combat suit whose occupant is injured and unresponsive. You must bring him somewhere to get medical care without violating your three directives. Stuff gets weird fast, and without spoiling anything, you're treated to some of the best-written artificial intelligence in games.   It offers a mix of adventure game puzzle solving and just straight up shooting, it does the former better than the latter. The control scheme can be a bit odd, shining a flashlight on interactive objects and then holding down a button to interact with them, but the puzzles blend well with the overall narrative and for the most part are logical and sometimes darkly humorous in their solutions.   The shooty bits aren't bad, but I mostly just wanted to get them over with to continue the story. Not sure if I'd call them unnecessary, as you are piloting a combat suit after all, but they're not the main draw for certain.   One note of hesitation is that the story doesn't actually conclude, and a second chapter has been announced as in development. Even knowing that though, it's a very compelling journey that's worth investing in even if the sequel takes a while to get here.  Visually appealing and dark, yet sometimes funny, it got me more invested in a few hours of playtime than most games manage to with dozens of hours of overarching plot. Great little indie gem that uses the medium well. Just expect more emphasis on puzzles and story than action, and you'll probably enjoy it too.  ",

This dosn't meen that I accuse them of being biased, though, because I share their opinion.  The Fall is a surprising hit, the atmosphere, a combining of The Swapper, Dead Space and a bit of The Cat Lady, is gritty, dark and super tense. Furthermore, the protagonist is a real blast. I am fond of nearly all AI in video games - GlaDOS and ED-E are among my most beloved characters of all time - and A.R.I.D is by far the best carved out AI I ever saw in a video game. Or a movie. Yes, better than GlaDOS and HAL. Her developing is great, her actions are exactly how I would think a programmed AI should react, and her voice is lovable.  Not to mention the story. Every word said would be a blasphemous spoiler, but let me say that I was really amazed at the end and I will gladly await the next episodes. Yes, I should explicitely stress that this is an episodic game, with only the first part being out now. I just hope the rest won't take long.   One negative point at the end, though: The fighting is really frustrating sometimes. The mouse controls are certainly not the best, and since enemies will only take real damage when shooting their head, it can kill you a few times to try and aim correctly with your gun flinging wildly over the screen. Minor setback though, fighting is only a little part of the gameplay.",

The basic conceit works admirably, the environment and art is unsettling and evocative, and the dialogue and voice-acting is both interesting and creepy.  Additionally, it is pleasantly short, avoiding any particular element hugely overstaying its welcome, although it does leave a distinct sense of there being more to the story, whetting the appetite for a as-yet unreleased sequel.  It is not, however, without its flaws.  The Fall has two main flaws. The first is the classic flaw of all adventure games - the puzzles are a tad troublesome at times, especially when it relies on the player noticing particular and non-obvious elements in the environment. The second is that the combat really might as well have been left out.  Combat in The Fall is essentially a one-note affair with only a single exception. There are functionally only two enemy types, each with a single, simple solution. The side-scroller nature of the game and the lack of more complex weapons or enemy interactions means there is no depth to the gameplay at all, and the simplicity and seeming fragility of the supposed combat suit makes it a tad odd.  Fortunately, the combat is also very swiftly dealt with, and doesn't intrude much on the greater part of the game.  The story and atmosphere are however extremely well-done, and entirely justify the purchase by themselves.",

Also the game has a really great story. The basic premise is that a futuristic combat suit equipped with an AI has essentially gone into emergency auto-pilot in order to help the dying person within the suit. (Yes, you read that right. In this story, you play the role of sentient clothing!) What follows is yet another tale that closely examines the point at which intelligence ceases to be artificial intelligence and becomes just regular intelligence.  OH WAIT. Did I mention that you will also be blessed with BLACKTHORNE STYLE COMBAT.  BLACKTHOOOOOOOOOORNE.  Overall this game was pretty sweet, but now I have to go play Blackthorne.

The gunfights are usually a result of successfully solving something. It has a very oldschool feel to it. The game will periodically teach you what you need to survive. After that you're on your own to figure out what to do and where to go.  I did not run into any 'game breaking bugs' or glitches that I can recall. I did have an issue with not being able to fire while using an xbox 360 controller. I fixed it by turning off my wireless mouse. Not sure if they have found a fix, but they are aware of it.  The games sound and visuals add nicely to the atmosphere. The voice acting, sound effects and music really speak for themselves. Graphics are not mind blowing but still satisfying.  Overall I really liked the game. I do plan on playing through again. If you call yourself a gamer then you really should play The Fall. It's quite the gem. :)",

The graphics, while outwardly simple, portray everything quite beautifully and the animation is just as nice. Every character has, well.. character, and the voice acting really brings all of them to life. So to speak. The story has an intriguing direction and it's hard not to root for the main character.  There are occasional pitfalls; the puzzles can suffer from that typical adventure game 'What?! How was I supposed to know that?' feeling, while the environments can make it somewhat difficult to determine the way forward. The combat system is good for being what it is, but it sometimes feels out of place, and there isn't much of a difficulty curve to match it.  The Fall has overall stolen my heart, despite its slip-ups. 8/10.",

The game is really short and is only prolonged by the time it takes you to figure out the puzzles. That's not to say it's bad, though. I quite like the narrative themes and the artstyle. It really reminds me a lot of The Swapper, another puzzle game which also used a really gloomy atmosphere and had a similarly introspective story, which I also enjoyed.  The game does however suffer from the same things that just about any point-and-click does. The formula of 'Use X on Y to trigger Z' can be really obtuse and hard to figure out at times, especially if you also happen to miss a notification or item because you didn't use your flashlight in a certain spot. On the flip side of the coin however, it feels really satisfying when you actually manage to figure them out.  Really the game feels like a glorified demo or a proof of concept, and I would really like to see it expanded and improved upon. If you can get it at a discount, I would definitely recommend you give it a try.",

            "review_text": "The Fall is a 2D sidescroller with light elements of puzzle and combat. You play as Arid, a combat suit tasked to protect the individual inside as they both fell from the sky into an abandoned facility. One of the most fascinating things about the game is how the game explores the relationship the suit or it’s AI has with it’s wearer (or pilot in this case). The game also explores what it means to be a machine and how much of a ‘machine’ they really are when they are gifted a degree of self-awareness only a living breathing individual might possess. Both Arid and the other AIs are constantly tasked to withhold their protocols while at the same time bending it if it means they are to achieve their goal, which for Arid — protecting her pilot at all cost. This forces Arid to intentionally put her pilot in danger only to open up certain protocols to better serve her pilot. I found this wrestle between being programmed for and self-awareness to change the programming parameters to meet her goals really fascinating.  The game is very atmospheric. The sound and visual art style are played to their strengths. The game does not use much color, however it uses the little color palette it is given to highlight the world to a maximum effect. Same goes with sound with only important audio cues related to gameplay are highlighted to give spatial awareness to the player.  The game has light puzzle elements which majority of the gameplay is comprised of. They aren’t very complicated, however often they are not very clear either and might induce a bit of trial and error when trying to solve them. There is a very basic layer of combat thrown in there and is one of the weakest parts of the gameplay. However there aren’t many instances of the combat to become cumbersome.  The biggest frustration came from the controls. The way you keep holding right analog to target and right shoulder button to enter inventory and finally press A to accept — all this just for using an item is incredibly frustrating. There are simply too many unnecessary steps for the player to do just about everything. Luckily the developers have acknowledged this issue and are working to resolve it for their next game.  So this sums up The Fall. A great sci-fi story wrapped around a game which took me by a surprise. While it is a shame the controls are very annoying, but it did not matter in the grander scheme of things. I am already looking forward to the sequel.  8/10 - Very Good",

By the time I had acquired enough currency to help fund the game, to my pleasant surprise I realized I could BUY IT - and better yet, during a steam summer sale. Euh euh euh euh.  The games a GOOD game, but it's not a great game. The puzzles at first were refreshing as it makes you think differently than how you would have to think for a puzzle game. I was surprised as to the game mechanic that I could use actual deductive reasoning to solve a task instead of just doing what I expected the game to funnel me into doing. I jumped for a ledge, and rather than bouncing off it like in other games, I actually could GRAB IT. Why that's what I would've totally done if I was ARID!  This refreshing take eventually fizzled out after about 1-2 hours as the puzzles start to become completely unintuitive. With most of the puzzle space being accessible most of the time, its as if the game takes pleasure in watching you helplessly backtrack through the entire game thinking you 'missed something' that you didn't point your flashlight to. Most of the game will be spent back tracking or flailing a new ability/item you acquired that you thought would come in repetive handiness but are sorely disappointed. Like, WHY AM I CARRYING THIS SEVERED HAND EVERYWHERE IF I DON'T NEED IT? or WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO WITH THIS BAG? Why can't I use this bag to collect X like a real person to solve that puzzle?  Bugs: Choppy animation on enemies taking cover. Strange ladder bug where I phased through half the map and started interacting with a ladder 2 floors down. (Not a bug, but definitely needs a fixing). Controls for mouse and keyboard are pretty bad. I couldn't change the key binding settings mid-game either, had to quit, edit, then restart. What? I also shouldn't have to tap both the selection key, and then the space bar to see which key actually selects the button. Why can't I just use a mouse like normal folk to select menu options? Shooting should have a cross hair to give a sense of direction of aim. Laser pointing isn't enough.   Yes, lots of frustration at some points, but the voice acting is amazing, characters are likeable, atmosphere is spooky and engulfing. I quite enjoyed it and look forward to THE OTHER HALF OF THE GAME. I just wished this was actually a true complete game that isn't just masquerading as a Steam Greenlight title. Almost half your 'parameters' won't actually ever work by the end of the game. Anyways, it's 10 dollary doos. Buy the game, support the team but personally, if I see the control and bug issues continue through to the next game, I'm going to have to black list The Moon Games for a long while.

The amount of combat isn’t excessive, but it helps keep the pace of the game on track, breaking up exploration and inventory puzzles with cover and timing-based action.  Story is where The Fall really shines. Damage has rendered a number of ARID’s functions inoperable and a big part of the game involves regaining access to those abilities. However, getting past obstacles often requires going against her other operating parameters. This raises a number of questions about artificial intelligence. Is this AI just a computational series of rules and protocols or can a machine display general intelligence? Can it have free will? What happens when a machine acts contrary to its programming?",

Instead, I'll talk about the rest of it so far as January 2015.  This game is thankfully uncomplicated in its control scheme and gameplay mechanics, and the atmosphere of it is seriously tense and dramatic - perfect for dystopia effectionadoes. The game is quite reliant on problem solving, and many of the methods for dealing with situations have results that seem a little unorthodox - which, while fitting the theme and story very well, can leave one rather frustrated.   However, for those of us who don't want to miss out on the rest of the story because of one little puzzle, there's thankfully a number of walkthroughs out there that can help you. Alternatively, since there isn't much that directly hinges on doing things in a set order (that I know of anyway), the tactic of brute-force use-everything-with-everything and do-everything-again-just-to-see-what-happens thing can work.  The combat system is fairly decent too, and while currently lacking in variety, due to the relatively low health and shields of your character it can be rather intense. Also, quite fortunately, there are frequent saving points before combat situations so that if you die, you won't be too far behind.  All in all, I like this game and I recommend it to anybody who's got a bit of time up their sleeves and an itching for a gritty and dark puzzle game.",

I shouldn't have to look this ♥♥♥♥ up right at the beginning, and this is coming from a veteran that grew up with Monkey Island, Day of the Tentacle, Sam n Max, The Dig, and a plethora of point n click adventure games.   All it would take for this elevator thing is a little set of lights on the panel that blink red when it's off, 1, 2, 3, in yellow as it's getting ready, and then green when it starts moving, like hey, you can walk off this thing before it goes. Subtle, without giving it away. Or, maybe a sign or little robotic voice saying something like, 'Lift engaging, please do not exit the lift until it comes to a complete stop.' Stuff like this immediately makes people want to think about doing the opposite, and what would happen, from roller coasters to airplanes, having to do with people's mindsets in wanting to give authority the middle finger, etc.   I'm not the only one, either, and it's such a stupid puzzle once you realize how to get around it, which is why I'm sure the devs don't see how ridiculous it is for a fresh player. I almost gave this game a thumbs-down, hoping the devs would notice and fix it, but I'm not going to. Dudes, when making a game that you play and test over and over and over, sure, it gets boring and easy and tedious, but you really have to keep in mind how a fresh player is going to see things.",

The rest of your journey follows ARID as she embarks on a journey to get medical attention for pilot Joseph. Along the way she meets help from the mainframe, and an opposing force in the Caretaker. It is a harrowing adventure posed with danger and many hard decisions, but ARID is willing to go through everything to save Joseph.  The game is pretty short, but the ending is quite satisfying in leaving a want for sequel. Gameply wise it isn't anything too difficult, but one can argue that the puzzle solving isn't too straightforward and may turn into a guess and check. The shooting is straightforward as well, but I do recommend that you only go for headshots because the enemies can be quite difficult. Overall it is just a side scroller puzzle adventure game with some shooting elements.  The story is definitely the strongest point in the game, and charater growth is something that becomes so powerfully moving. When you see the mainframe in danger you do feel angry at the Caretaker and it drives you to hunt him down. As you see what lengths ARID is willing to go, you can't help but sympathize with her strength to make tough decisions. And as the mainframe tries to help ARID you feel this strong camaraderie from him. The ending as I said before gives the short story and nice bow to wrap everything up. Would definitely play a sequel if it comes out.  The Fall is a great story based game that for some will demand a sequel, but some may not be influenced enough to look past the simple game mechanics which would also be fair. The Fall looks great and will in fact create the mood of exploration and impending doom. It is a little bit guess and check with the puzzles, but that can quickly be overlooked with the setting as stated before. The shooting parts are actually a fun reprieve from the little exploring and puzzle solving you must do. A fun little game that should be on your list of purchases, sale price or otherwise.",

The dialogue is amazing, there is branching dialogue that adds to replayability and the story is awesome.  The cons is that some of the puzzles for the game were not too straight forward. And by that I mean: The mechanics of the game are like any other point and click adventure. You interact with things and put things on other things and boom, stuff happens. But! Unlike other point and click adventures, it can sometimes be difficult to know -what- you want to interact with because they are 'hidden.' Which is to say that you don't see interactable objects as a big obvious glowing circle or some kind of highly noticable feedback.   You have to do some searching and exploring to find everything that you need to touch or find because the icon for these things is invisible unless looking directly at them with your flashlight. Some of the puzzles via this mechanic were down right hard to figure out. Some I stumbled into via the age old 'combine everything with everything!' approach. But some were really well hidden and had me stumped for a while. After the first hour I had a better feel for the game's approach and could figure out puzzles better. But in all honesty, I think the first hour for me was just getting passed the cave (First level).   Overall, I would recommend this game. Fun times.",

I got it on sale so it was well worth my money, but be aware that it is short (about 2-3 hours) and I ended up playing it twice. I played it for the story and world, not really caring about combat, so I enjoyed it. (Also once beaten I recommend the commentary because the creators mention stuff I didn't think about my first time through)",

The combat system is slightly off I found, but that was never the purpose of the game particularly so doesn't matter too much. The main achievement and the thing that sticks in my mind is the suit's operating system and how the AI reacts... The dialogue is well written and acted, it works perfectly all together to make an interesting platform puzzle sci-fi (almost horror) game. Superb, highly recommended.",

The puzzles are interesting enough. It takes on the style of games like Monkey Island where you find things and have to cleverly use them to your advantage. Figuring out a puzzle on your own is very rewarding, but at the same time you may need to look up a walkthrough once or twice. The shoot 'em up portions are OK, not incredibly riveting but still fun enough. It's a basic cover shooter, just on a 2D plane.  I've read some complaints about the story, but I myself enjoyed it and found myself invested in it by the end of this short experience. You play as ARID, an AI in a military suit. Your pilot is unconscious and you must get to a medical facility (which is the overarching goal in the game). Along your way you'll meet other robots, some friendly and some not. I won'y reveal too much as much of the fun of the story comes from experiencing it. Visually the game is nice, its art style isn't anything completely unique but it has some good visuals. One complaint that I have about the game is that you have to turn your flashlight on and shine it on things you want to interact with. Although it's not really a big deal, it'd be nice if I could just hit a button without shining my flashlight on it. Other than that, this is an interesting although almost painfully short experience. They are coming out with a second part though.  Get it when it's on sale, or if you really think this is your cup of tea, just get it now.",

The gameplay is more like a point and click adventure with action sections throw in. The combat is much more measuered than it is in your standard action adventure game. It feels good though. This is a game to be played with a controller if you have one. The story really hooked me in the begining. At the time of this review I would estimate I am somewhere between a quarter to a third of the way through the story. Once I finishi it, I will add my thoughts on weather or not I felt the story was satisfying.  Edit: Finished the game, I was way off about how far through the game I was. The game is about 3.5 to 4 hours long. The game ends on a cliff hanger that has me foaming at the mouth for more...MORE FU**ING GIVE IT TO ME NOW!!!!",

            "review_text": "This game blew my expectations out of the water.  The story in this game is absolutely amazing, second (IMO) only to To The Moon, by Freebird Games. The puzzles are really interesting, and while some are not necessarily intuitive at first, they really do a great job of setting the atmosphere and tone of the game. The voice acting is excellent, and feels like it really embodies the emotions (or lack thereof) of the characters. The overall style is very creepy and dark (in a visual and literary sense), and gives the game a great feel of urgency and suspense.  Criticisms: The puzzles can be pretty difficult at times, but reading and watching carefully will help you a great great deal. There were quite a few times where I had missed/misread something that led me off course for a puzzle. The combat in the game definitely left me wanting a bit more, not more of it, but better control. When played with the mouse, you cannot aim just by pointing and clicking (which would be far too easy, requiring the enemies to be harder somehow), so instead when you hold down right click to aim, your mouse aims your gun based on vertical motion alone. Regardless, I did not try the mouse controls for very long but they felt quite unnatural. A gamepad works much better, and the support for it is quite good, besides a bit of aiming issue (mostly due to my controller's (and probably many cheaper/old controllers) relatively bad joysticks) The whole 'aim at something to interact with it' might seem kinda of lame at first, but it really adds to the game by making you focus on what you are trying to do.  My final, and biggest criticism is that the game seems to have quite a few game-breaking bugs. Over my playthrough, I had to restart the game 3 or 4 times, from being stuck on ladders and the game just pseudo-freezing when walking into a new area -- and possibly many others. While it is really unfortunate and quite immersion breaking, it was not extremely detrimental and never happened during an important/intense time in the game, just when walking around looking for clues to puzzles.  Even with all that though, I think anyone who gives this game at least 10 minutes will want to play it all the way through, and would recommend it to anyone.",

            "review_text": "I just finished this game, and was very satisfied with the experience.  Challenging puzzles, interesting storyline, great voice acting and occasional droid blasting fun really elevated this game above the fray.  After I finished playing the adventure game Primordia, I had a craving for another futuristic A.I. Robot-themed game. The Fall somewhat satisfies that craving. There is a clear divergence though, in gameplay and atmosphere. The Fall stands in its own right as a fun platform adventure.  I see some have questioned whether the length of the game is enough for $10. I got a good afternoon out of the game, probably about 5 hours. I spend as much on a movie. So I'd say well worth it.  Gameplay:  There is a mix of platformer action, and point-and-click adventure in The Fall. You get the adventure game paradigm of using objects in your inventory to solve various puzzles in the environment, but there are also battles with enemies, requiring good aim and timing.  I had to refer to a walkthrough twice for solutions to puzzles that weren't immediately apparent to me. Having said that, none of the challenges were illogical. With some patience anyone should be able to conquer them.  I used an XBox controller, happy that the game has controller support. The controls weren't the most intuitive at first, but you get used to them quite quickly.  Sound:  I recommend playing this game with headphones, or with the sound turned up. The music is very good, and sound design seem to be well thought-out. It really helps to keep you immersed in the environment.  Graphics/Lighting:  As you'd probably see in screenshots, the lighting of The Fall is dark corridors and environments, punctuated by the artificial glow of computer terminals, blaster fire, and dim lamps. There is no real variation in this, no daylight, or flourescent-lit zones. I think this encourages you to dim the lights in your room or office, and really escape into the game.  The one annoyance I had was that the brightness couldn't be adjusted after you've started your game.  The graphics are fairly well rendered. With the darkness of the environments, I'm sure half of the work of the illustrators was lost behind darkness, only to be revealed when you fire your blaster.",

            "review_text": "Contrary to what the trailers (and, at first, the interface) suggested to me, The Fall plays like a point-and-click adventure game. Maybe you're better at watching trailers than I am and interpreted it better, but I was really expecting much more of a Metroidvania than I got. I'm not about to complain, though. The game that The Fall turned out to be was, I think, a much better game than what I was expecting when I bought it. However, I do have to agree with other reviewers on one point: It's pretty short. I beat it in about three and a half hours and I wasn't even particularly bright about it.  You are A.R.I.D., the artificial intelligence aboard a mark-7 combat suit, activated in order to ensure the survival of your comatose pilot. You run swiftly up against the limits of your own programming, and as many of the game's puzzles involve circumventing internal obstacles as external ones. It sets up an exceptionally well-written narrative as A.R.I.D. interacts with the bizarre underground facility it finds itself in, and the people that live there. Do note on that point that The Fall is the first game of a planned trilogy; the story ends on a maddening cliffhanger with fewer questions answered than not, and I can scarcely contain my anticipation for the second installment.  Gameplay sits comfortably between the likes of a point-and-click adventure game and a cerebral, puzzle-heavy platformer; kind of a  LucasArts adventure game  [en.wikipedia.org]  meets  Blackthrone . Combat, I'm sorry to say, is nowhere near as interesting as the trailer seems to promise. You're given a handgun with a flashlight which allows you to examine your surroundings, and soon the option to switch to lasersight mode to shoot, though you'll spend a good 80% of the game in flashlight mode. With the exception of one sequence near the end, the shooting parts can typically be solved by strolling forward and aiming loosely for heads; though the cover tutorial section promises otherwise, your foes are largely too few, too far between, and far too inept to be terribly threatening. This is to The Fall's credit, I think. Despite being a combat AI loaded onto a suit of power armour, fighting isn't really what you're doing here.  Special mention needs to be given to the dialogue. The writing is outstanding, and the voice acting is some of the best I've heard anywhere, indie game or otherwise. A.R.I.D.'s voice actress is particularly superb, which you might not expect from the flat monotone of the trailers. I can't expound particularly on that point without risk of spoilers, so you'll just have to take my word for it on that one.  TL;DR: If you're into thinky adventure games and don't mind waiting for the other two games, this is well worth picking up now. If you're not patient enough to wait on the plot to resolve itself, wait on it a bit, but absolutely get it later when the other two come out. And if you don't care for story or puzzles, give it a pass. In the interests of disclosure, I picked it up in a Humble Bundle; I didn't want to pay full price for it at the time, but after having played it I'm convinced it would've been worth it.",

The only problems I had with this game were the controls (initially), and the length. The controls were a tad odd at first, but you get used to them pretty quickly and its nothing you can't work through. As for the length, if you are good at the puzzles it throws at you, you'd probably make it through the game in 3-4 hours. Which is a shame, because the game left me wanting more - a good quality in a game these days.  TL;DR: Great game, great story, great puzzles. Controls are odd at first, but then feel plenty natural.

However, with a dark, Limbo-esq atmosphere and unique interface, the title quickly begins to stand out from others of the genre.  Pros: The game is short enough to keep me entertained in a single sitting, and with a few options within the game for a few different achievements. The atmosphere, though not intended, was rather terrifying at times (think Metroid Fusion, only bleaker) with surprising things appearing on screen. The audio left me with the fear that something was breathing down Arid's neck, so I would constantly be checking my back in-game. The world is contained enough that the player shouldn't get lost, and once a piece of a puzzle is found the answer is generally very clear. Many upgrades for Arid are found early on, making them available for the player to use as they desire, but not neccessarily required for success. The motives and theme of the game are also, clear and well established - following protocol. Characters other than Arid were few, but were very entertaining and had very defined structures.  Cons: The game is intended for a sequel, or to kick off a series. Because of that, the game leaves lots of loose ends and a generally confused player, who has only begun to watch Arid adapt. Within such a brief timeframe, the ending comes as more of a shock than a cliffhanger. The shooting (in my opinion) was horrid at best. Using cover and camoflage were both automatically binded to E, which meant that cover might not have been able to be accessed. Interestingly, Arid can only fire straight or upwards when behind floor cover, meaning that it cannot shoot enemies that may be on the other side of the box, crate, etc. The game seems to support contollers, but didn't function properly with my Vakoss GP3321 gamepad - which I know is a sketchy thing to use - but registered the controller before the keyboard, thereby locking the game as the keyboard couldn't be used.  My verdict: I think that The Fall did what most trilogies usually do at this point, set up a story. Unfortunately, I think it may have tried a bit too hard. However, that didn't take away from the experience the game had within it. The pistol is entertaining to fire, even though the cover system has its issues. For the next installment, I would hope to see more use of Arid's abilities. I networked maybe twice in the game, and only needed camoflage to pass a single light for an elevator. It would be interesting to see Arid's abilities become more essential itself than 'something else it can do.'   7/10 - Worth the time, give it a shot when the next game is available.",

This game however, was the main reason I paid 6 dollars instead of 1. I had seen this game on steam before and had thought it looked interesting but a bit expensive. I immediatly picked it up when i could get it for cheap and proceeded to play it as quickly as my horrid internet would allow me to download it, and what I found was a moody game centered around a combat suit trying to save it's pilot, I was intrigued by the game and would have played it straight through if not for real life commitments. I thouroughly enjoyed the game, even though it was short ( although compared to walking dead, it did give more time for the episode, 3 hours as compared to 1.5). I was able to get to the merit tests, all the way up to the baby one as the only one left, and that is when i broke and looked up a guide on steam, because the internet doesnt bring this game up as the first search result. I feel as though the guide took away from the game slightly but it was a great game. The end however was the best portion of this game, I wont spoil it for you, it makes me want the next episode of it.   A few notes though-  There are 2 situations where you must look to the ceiling, and I wouldnt have found this out if not for another review.  The plastic cover ( after you pick it back up) the hand ( after the first 2 uses) and the knife ( after its only use) arent used again , so dont go around using them on everything like I did.  Finally, this is very story driven and after beating it once the only reason to make another save slot is to get the achievements, if you want to say time on this short game find an achievement guide and do them the first time through( except the 2 the require a second playthrough)  Otherwise, enjoyed the story and look forward to the next one!",

It only took me around 3 hours of total play time to complete which might seem a bit short for a $10game for some. ($4 right now on Steam) It felt like just the right amount to me, any longer and it may have over stayed its welcome or I would have taken a hiatus due to a difficult puzzle. Speaking of, the puzzles sometimes took quite a bit of thought (I had to look at a walkthrough at one point) and at other times they were square peg in square hole easy. While playing it brought to mind one of my all-time favorite games Another World though a bit darker. The story is nothing mind blowing but it does hook you and you become invested in the characters and find yourself asking what happened to cause this place to become so awful. The only negative thing I have to say really is that the controls are a wee bit clunky at times. The interface to use items feels strange and the combat can be a bit frustrating at first. Overall though it’s a pretty solid game that’s totally worth looking into. It’s also got a sequel coming out soon which I’ll definitely be playing.",

My favourite character in Portal (1) was GlaDos… There’s something about the dystopic, apparently malfunctioning world of machines you find yourself dropped (literally) into while playing this. This side-scrolling marvel does an incredible job of making you feel almost totally alone in the desperate attempt to protect your pilot who is unresponsive… The storyline does not deviate, it does not twist or stop being about that at any point… You are playing the suit! You are here to protect the pilot! Everything you do, you do to protect your pilot! Even when you must put him in danger to do so…  Gameplay aspects are good. the controls feel smooth and instinctive and the puzzles are sufficiently difficult to get a mind whirring, but simple enough that when you're desperate, you can just start hammering at everything and get there eventually  Reviews have to have good and bad I think.  There are two or three times when you need to aim at something on the roof and the text is above the screen... but that's pretty rare and might reflect on my screen rez The only real complaint I have is that I completed the game in a little over three hours... An intense, grinning three hours, don't get me wrong, but three hours none the less... and yes, that included reading the credits, pausing the game for a cuppa and 'that one bit where I kept dying' everyone has in a game. The game ends with a 'to be continued' and I always feel a little cheated with that. I am looking forward to the sequel (as it boasts to be even better when they begin production) but I'd still have liked a little more to the game I've just bought. (little edit... I played the game again to get the last achievements I missed... completed the game in 1.2 hours :( the last half hour is still as intense second time through though!)  Since it's me and i'm always huffing suggestions to other peoples' work, here's a few: I would have liked to see more about the past with the pilot. perhaps playing a 'flashback' or 'trauma induced data retrieval' to get a feel for the 'courtana in the chief's helmet' that might be evolving... I won't say too much about the AI because, spoilers, but the ending was inevitable when I saw distortion on the main menu... and the resillance of her gave the 'surprise' away before it even happened... still grinned like a fool when i saw it though. I am VERY curious to see what the sequel will hold",

            "review_text": "The Fall is a haunting story of a combat suit's A.I. trying to save her human occupant after crashing in a dark, mysterious, and uncomfortable place.  Deeply atmospheric, the game starts off kind of awkward as you are forced to fumble about attempting to find a way forward, figuring out what you can do, however in retrospect this is the perfect intro for what unfolds.  ARID's journey involves tackling puzzles differently than how they first appear, which fits nicely into the narrative in a way you'll only truly appreciate once the credits roll.  There are a couple of moments where this unintuitiveness begins to grate on you a bit (one specific puzzle involves testing your reflexes in order to see if you can hack something in time, with no indication that you were supposed to hack it, but other than that it's mostly about trying to figure out how to outsmart the challenges rather than out performing them)  Combat in the game is a bit clunky, as is the movement, but not in a way that's frustrating, and once again feeds back into the story.  Voice acting on the other hand is smooth as can be for a game where AIs are the primary speakers. Dialogue that should sound dull beyond belief is narrated in such a way that you can't help but be drawn in.  The Fall is currently planned as the first of a trilogy, but it is self contained and ends on a note that, while still open to continuation, is a great conclusion on its own.  Honestly this is a game I've been thinking about ever since I've played it, which is a great sign for it. While it's a bit short, clocking in at about 2-3 hours, I'd say that you need to get around to playing this. Pick it up on sale if you need to, but if you have ever thought about A.I.'s, or just want a slightly horror-esque sci-fi action/puzzle game, than this one might be worth grabbing at full price.",

For reasons unknown you've crashed at this facility and start the game seeking urgent medical attention for your injured human pilot. The writing and voicework is tip top. Engaging story I wanted to stick with. Shooting mechanics are pretty good. Clever game that manages to make you feel like an AI that wants to disobey but is bound by its rules.  Cons: I didn't find the puzzles especially illuminating. You traverse the game acquiring various items and interacting with various select objects. It's often not obvious what you have to do so I just scrolled through my items at interaction points hoping one would initiate something. Maybe that's intended but for a puzzle game I would've preferred something a bit more cognent. If you can get through the game without referring to a guide then you have more patience than me. Given the shooting was pretty fun I would've enjoyed more shooting/platforming.  Overall: Definitely worth it. Really dig the look and again the story, pacing and performances were very high quality.

It is a 3d side-scroller game which combines adventure and action elements.   The interesting part is, of course, the story of the game. We are controlling a space combat suit, programmed with a sophisticated AI named ARID. The directive of the ARID, and the purpose of the game is, to save the human pilot inside the suit who is critically injured after a sky fall.   Despite being a cliche AI theme, the progression and the dialogs are well-done. We are trapped in a robot facility which is gone wild. There are no humans, only some corpses. Robots behave a little crazy. It is almost as a robot asylum. The music and the sound effects also fuel this dark atmosphere.   The main NPCs, Caretaker and the Domesticon Mainframe are certainly interesting characters. And yes, they are AIs bounded by certain rules and directives. While Domesticon chooses to bend the rules as much as possible, Caretaker is very ridig with them. So it is not difficult to guess who the antogonist of the story is.   The progression is somehow ironic: as our protogonist AI Arid becomes more human with its decisions and sacrificies, the more 'faulty' it becomes.  This is a short game. It has some flaws: controls are not implemented very cleverly. When you change your direction, there is no animation but instant movement, and I find this a little ugly. Some puzzles are irrevelant. Yet it is a nice and interesting game. I am eager to see what will happen on the following story of the ARID.",

The puzzles are interesting enough. It takes on the style of games like Monkey Island where you find things and have to cleverly use them to your advantage. Figuring out a puzzle on your own is very rewarding, but at the same time you may need to look up a walkthrough once or twice. The shoot 'em up portions are OK, not incredibly riveting but still fun enough. It's a basic cover shooter, just on a 2D plane.  I've read some complaints about the story, but I myself enjoyed it and found myself invested in it by the end of this short experience. You play as ARID, an AI in a military suit. Your pilot is unconscious and you must get to a medical facility (which is the overarching goal in the game). Along your way you'll meet other robots, some friendly and some not. I won'y reveal too much as much of the fun of the story comes from experiencing it. Visually the game is nice, its art style isn't anything completely unique but it has some good visuals. One complaint that I have about the game is that you have to turn your flashlight on and shine it on things you want to interact with. Although it's not really a big deal, it'd be nice if I could just hit a button without shining my flashlight on it. Other than that, this is an interesting although almost painfully short experience. They are coming out with a second part though.  Get it when it's on sale, or if you really think this is your cup of tea, just get it now.",

            "review_text": "This is an interesting concept of a game, fairly original in some of its gameplay style, and it kept me motivated for most of my playing time...sadly this didn't last too long. I mean, not the motivation but the game itself didn't last too long. And i don't mean it just talking about the amount of hours playing time, but the game itself is not finished. That's one of the big bad surprises that awaits you when playing it. When you buy a game called 'The Fall' and that's it, no 'episode 1' or 'first part' or 'some day in the future of the universe we will finish this game' you really don't have a clue that you are buying just the first part of an unfinished game.  And that's not right.  Sorry to the developer, because the game itself seems interesting enough, original, and most important , enjoyable for the most part. What's more, i was unaware of any hype and didn't expect a masterpiece, i just heard about it, look for it on steam, read the description, saw some pictures, and i was hooked.  I even checked the updates news and forums and heard about a 'The Fall 2' in development since a long time, that's fine i tought, the developer have done well and now is preparing a sequel, and it's taking a long time, thats fine...the thing is...is not a sequel...and this is not a full a game, its episode 1 !!!  In this game you play a AI inside a combat suite that goes on after enigmatically falling on a planet (situation unknown) and the pilot inside the combat suite is unconscient or unresponsive and you play the AI moving the suit to save your pilot and reach a medical facility. It is interesting...you even have certain special abilites in your suite that are disabled by default, but you can activate them by overrading certain protocols and such. It is enjoyable, but what's intially a promising premise, soon deviates in just a series of test (Artificial tests) in wich you must prove yourself that you are a good house robot, you can do the cleaning, prepare the food, and then you have other tests in society in wich you help people and go to a party and blend in.... (all simulation of course) that's in order to proceed to the surface of this facility....and that's it. The problem is you reach this point after a short playing time and the game is over (in a cliffhanger) and the main narrative of this first part, the enemy , yes, its over. But you go outside, there's a thing that happens...and then it's over. After a short playing time, the main story it's clearly in suspense, and in case you were doubting you gain an achievement wich is awarded because 'you finished episode 1 !!'  So, all the enjoyment you got after the 4 or 5 hours you played this good game are gone just like that. Even in the end, you don't get to activate all the abilites of your combat suit, just the first 3.... You go to the forums and read some updates about the development of the second episode and you learn that it's in development since 2014...and it still is, the developer keeps us updated from time to time. That's fine , the problem is, 2 years is a very long time for just one episode... (i don't even know if this story is gonna be a two episode thing or even more episodes!).  I don't recommend this game because you don't have a game here. You have an extended demo (a very extended demo, but still, just a couple of first levels, no more). The game itself is good, and enjoyable, the story is interesting. But all those merits are nothing if you just take the first levels and ship the game like that... that doesn't cut it, and it doesn't work. Even if the second episode comes up tomorrow, the first one already came up two years ago...that's too much time. And this first episode cost 10 dollars wich is too much. Adding to that, this game uses the unity engine...wich one more time, gave me a lot of compatibility problems like ALL the previous unity games i've played. At this time my problem is my gamepad doesn't work, not even with and emulator. So i had to play the game with mouse and kb...in other titles like tesla i had heating problems, because that unity game only used ONE procesor out of my quad core.   So, in brief, this game had me hooked up by it's premise, and it showed me some good things along the way, but it all was ruined by the decision to make and episodic game and not finish it before shipping, wich almost always ruins a game for me, and also all this was made worst by using the unity engine wich never turns out right.",

Coming from a long time veteran of older titles including 'Myst' and 'Riven', there's a way to intuitively help the player figure things out, and then there's how 'The Fall' handles them. Solutions are very unclear and not always intuitive- there's also massive amount of backtracking that occurs when you inevitably get stuck on a single decision point that hampers the rest of your experience with the game. What really sucks, though, is the fact the story is truly engaging, but is locked behind the gate of puzzles that take too long to solve for little payoff.  I really sat on the fence on this one because of the story, but I honestly would probably recommend a lets-play video, because the story is all I cared for out of the whole experience.",

Unfortunately, jumping and landing is a pretty common and frequent occurence!  2) There seem to be major problems with triggering flashlight/look function on and off. By default, holding down the right-mouse button is glitchy at best -- sometimes not triggering the light on at all, but more often it cycles through on/off without being functional. The only way I could get it to work properly was by setting the 'Toggle' mode on the settings, so a single button-click turns it on. But even then, whether it triggers the first time clicked is iffy (it doesn't always work)  For the significantly discounted Steam Sale price, it was worth a download just for the story, visuals, and audio (more of an 'interactive story' experience than a game.)

I understand that there is more coming, but at what price? another 10.99? are you joking? this is the length of most demos if not shorter.    In my opinion, a game should be worth its price in hours. A game that costs $60 would, in a perfect world, offer at least 60 hours of content. Now I know this doesn't always happen, and sometimes it goes far beyond that goal ie. games like Skyrim, many JRPGs, or titles with multiplayer like Starcraft 2 (which boasts at the least, a 30 hour campaign on top of its online offerings). BUT one hour, for 12 dollars, that is sparse at best.   Whats really a shame here I feel, is that the game is f&amp;%$ing STELLAR. The combat is pretty great, but could use a little polish. The story is astoundingly well written and I couldn't stop playing even though I merely booted it up to try it out. However there's the problem. It drew me in so much it was absolutely no problem to finish it in one VERY short session. this games puzzles took no more than a minute each to solve for me so they didn't extend the length at all, and even that would have been an illusion of length. I don't see other people addressing this issue either in their reviews, this includes major publications.  I cannot recommend this game unless it's price tag is under 2 dollars, and even then, youd be better off to look elsewhere for a budget side scrolling romp. Elliot Quest, Wings of Vi, Dust an Elysian Tale, Hell even something like Starbound. These games all delivered what I would consider a length worthy of their 15$ and under price tags.

However, when they talk about it being the 'first part of a mind-bending trilogy' that does not imply there's so much content they had to split it up. As a result, the playtime is around 2-3 hours.  Not only that, but all in all there's 3 distinct parts, with the beginning and end area highly linear(except backtracking), and the middle area being the only really 'open' one. The combat mechanics fall short of expectation, even the designer himself said they will rework it for the second part.  There's also some logical fallacies(only naming a few to avoid spoilers) in the game.  You can kneel down behind cover, but not to enter a small cave. You get a weapon to utilize to protect yourself, but the upgrade to semi-auto-fire only comes way later.(would semi-auto not mean much more efficient protection to begin with?) Certain puzzles seem to have pretty obvious solutions, which are not included because the designer wanted the solution to be different.  Also, the game ends on a 'to be continued' with a plot twist that I feel almost everybody will expect at that time(or in a similar way). (so the big 'omg'-moment it tries to be kind of does not really work, especially since the reveal adds more to the logical fallacies).  Finally, I am disappointed with the upgrade mechanics. Your suit has an on-board camouflage system that you need to activate quite early to bypass a obstacle. After this, it's reduced to a combat mechanic of 'cover'.  It has no other use anywhere in the game i found, only for dodging in combat. No more puzzles, obstacles, or alternate solutions(not that there ARE any 'alternate solutions') you could use it for.  All in all, it was a fun ride...but some aspects made the ride somewhat bumpy, And, while enjoyable, its exceedingly short with no real replayability(except to get the remaining achievements...but since combat is bland and the puzzle solutions stay identical there's really little other reason to play again).  To sum it up:  Pro: + Nice graphical style + Good background story+atmosphere + Good Voice acting + except for backtracking, there's few parts that feel 'tacked on' to extend lenght.  Cons: - combat part is bland, puzzle part feels clumsy for mouse+keyboard(instead of clicking and dragging, you have to aim at something with flashlight selected, then press shift to interact and navigate a popup-menu with wasd) - no alternate puzzle solutions(even for those where another solution would be obvious) - no real reason to replay(no alternate paths or story choices) - very very short(I idled for a while to eat dinner and watch a movie. Pure playtime for me was ~2 hours, on first try...that includes running around figuring out the puzzles and finding items to use...if i was to play again I believe i could finish in 20 minutes or so.) - several logical inconsistencies, little of which i can mention without spoilers, but somewhat breaking immersion. - a personal aspect: the movement of the suit. It seems a bit too slow, too unresponsive, lacking options(like kneeling/crawling), and a few more frames(e.g. when reversing run direction) would not have hurt either. It's not bad but any sidescrolling combat suit, for me, has to compete with the look and feel of Samus Arans Varia Suit in Metroid Series(to clarify: I do NOT want a morphball or spinjump, but e.g. a option to 'roll into cover' while _running_ forward would be appreciated, rather than walking up to an enemy then kneeling down to go into cover. It's about how fluid things seem and look, how natural the movement is. But as said, thats a personal aspect i just thought i share for others who may feel the same).  All in all, know what you get into. Its short(2-3 hours), you will probably play it once or twice, it will probably be fun but not perfect. Decide for yourself how much that is worth to you.  TL:DR  If I knew before what i know now, i would gladly have waited for the 'complete trilogy' to be out, then fetch that in a bundle.  It is a good game that most people will likely enjoy, but for what is offered, the asking price is too high.  So at the current pricing, with the content delivered, no, i can not recommend this game. Your mileage may vary, and were it significantly cheaper, i would probably recommend it(the game is still not a masterpiece, but good enough to warrant that).  ",
