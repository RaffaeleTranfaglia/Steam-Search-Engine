Suspect the developers made this game not so much to make money as to make a point. The only downside was the poor voice over; fortunately it isnâ€™t really a necessary component to the game. Ending was a bit abrupt but I think that it actually worked well considering the subject matter.",

Also really bad voice acting. Graphics might look good for it's price but thats all it has. The game begins in a tunnel where we hear a car crash, then we run for 5 minutes to find the car, oh that must be my car, thanks for playing.",
