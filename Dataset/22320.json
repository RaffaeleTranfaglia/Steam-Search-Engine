            "review_text": "I certainly understand why many of my friends have trouble getting into this game. If you're coming from Skyrim or Oblivion, you're probably used to having a full set of armor, a decent weapon or spell, knowledge of basic combat, and a fair amount of gold and potions before you even start exploring the world. Morrowind isn't like that. You start the game by stepping off of a boat in a poor swamp town with nothing but the clothes on your back and a rusty iron dagger. There is no fast traveling (or at least no free fast traveling), and the map can sometimes be confusing. The only way you can find what you're looking for sometimes is by reading vague directions your character wrote down in their journal. In Skyrim, Alduin appears before you even have control of your character. In Oblivion, the emperor tells you of Mehrunes Dagon's plot before you leave the first dungeon. In Morrowind, you don't even learn the main plot of the game until you're a few hours into it, and even then you don't have all the information. Many people would consider these things to be negative, or at least intimidating, but in reality I wouldn't have it any other way. If you can get past the dated mechanics and look, I remain convinced that this is the greatest Elder Scrolls game, and my favorite game of all time. The story is wonderful, the lore might possibly be the greatest in all of fiction, the world is wonderfully diverse and detailed, and there is a sense of freedom and magic that makes even games like Skyrim feel constained in comparison. Another incredible thing is that the modding community is still strong 13 years later, meaning that nearly every problem you could have with this game (including the borderline infamous dicerolling) can be fixed. This game is truly a masterpiece and a must play if you are a fan of RPGs. Although your character starts so low, lower than any other RPG I've ever played, the feeling of satisfaction you get when you win is indescribable. You truly feel like a God, and the NPCs treat you the same. There is a reason so many people still rave about this game so many years later, and while it is intimidating, it is without a doubt worth the effort.",

One simply cannot explain why =) Morrowind is an Role Playing Game. Abosulety free from story line. After completing initial character creation (5 minutes) you can go wherever you want and do whatever you want.   But what makes this game playable in 2017? Answer is - Plugins. Thousands of plugins, made by community over 17 years. Texture and graphics enchancing plugins, armor, quests, new lands... this game has unlimited potential for modding. If you still havent tried any mods, do so, you wont regret it!  And even without mods you will spent hours just walking in Vvardenfel, exploring, fighting, questing and looting.  This game is a legend. A must have.",

What kind of mud crab talks? Why travelling by jumping is good for your health? Go no further my friend. All your questions will be answered.  The Elder’s scroll III: Morrowind is an open world fantasy role-playing game developed by Bethesda Game Studios, and published by Bethesda Softworks and Ubisoft. Yeah, infamous Ubisoft. Don’t be afraid though. With mods like Morrowind Overhaul, it really comes alive with enjoyable playability. The main story takes place on Vvardenfell, an island in the Dunmer province of Morrowind.  You need a good pair of eyes with this game. Morrowind isn’t about great graphics. Morrowind isn’t about multiplaying with your homies either. It isn’t about perks, or kill streaks. It’s about love. Yeah, you got it. Love. After you have played Morrowind from start to end, all the way, you know why. All those beautiful Dunmer ladies with tight skirts. Those cat like Khajiit broads with their fancy nails. Orc girls with nice biceps. With a excellent story and races like these, you won’t find any trouble replaying your game, again and again.   I’m a mage lover. I publicly admit it. I love magic. I love the feeling, when I tear apart crowd of bandits with a fireball. I love when I shine like a diamond after buffs. Morrowind has really good variety of spells, and you can make your own spells too. If you are ambitious enough, you can become the leader of Mages guild, which is always nice. They have nice robes.  You didn’t find the answers right? You will my friend.  Want it? Get it. ",

            "review_text": "Oh, Morrowind. A game where you'll spend countless hours walking through the sprawling foyadas and dreary caves of Vvardenfell. Unlike it's successors, Oblivion and Skyrim, where they bring many of us to worlds that are familiar to us, Morrowind doesn't do that. Instead it brings you to a world unlike any other, the homeland of the Dunmer. From it's lush greens to the west, swampy marshes in the south and east, and deserted and diseased ashlands to the north. The questlines will take you all the way across the massive island, and no doubt will you be spending hours of your time just gazing at the beauty of Morrowind's aesthetics. Granted, it's a game from 2002 and without a doubt the graphics are dated. But with a few mods it will go a long way, and even with Morrowind unmodded, it is still a great game.  As for controls and gameplay, they are by far the clunkiest out of the TES series, and Oblivion shares this characteristic as well. The combat is 'hit by chance' and can get awfully annoying when you die five times to a mudcrab or a cliff racer. The protagonist walks and especially runs awfully slow at the beginning of the game, even with just clothing. My favorite thing, however, is the spells. Something that Skyrim definitely does not have and Oblivion could've been better with was spells and spell making. In Morrowind there is a MASSIVE plethora of spells you can use to create your very own spells, i.e. a spell I made called the Potato-Motato whereas it not only burns an enemy, but paralyzes and poisons it (Needless to say, it's pretty awesome, name aside.).  Although the music is great, the sound effects are... okay. The voice actors seemed to had sounded very bored and that they were just reading their scripts instead of sounding like they're actually their character. The sound effects are pretty much stock sounds you'd find from any game creator program. The stepping noise is awfully annoying and loud, even on lowered volume.  TL;DR It is a great game, and if you are a fan of Oblivion, Skyrim, or both, you NEED to try this game out.",

Wow, at the time 3D HW was starting to get powerful with Riva TNT2... The graphics were marvellous, this was THE RPG game I long awaited... I don't know how many thousands of hours I played, with a friend of mine we were hooked... Still listening to the Morrowind theme gives me shivers, and 'good memories', like if I was on holidays on an exotic island... 2016 now, I started it again... I know graphics are old now, but I refused the mods, I keep it vanilla, and after a while you're just into it... Still one of the best game, if not THE best game ever...  This game is so good that despite my 237 games currently on steam, it's the first time I write a review. And maybe the last... This game worth it, every decent CRPG fan should experience this game.  I played Skirim, it was too easy, nice but easy, and Skyrim feels tiny close to MW... Also MW have a lot of different ambiences and landscape, a lot of races to interact, etc...  I dunno why people don't like combat, it's not 'Mortal Kombat', it's a traditional RPG, which is based on statistics, and I love it.  Welcome to Morrowind, enjoy your trip here, you have plenty to explore, months of reading, years of fun... ",

            "review_text": "Time to make a wall of text.  Morrowind was not only my second TES game (my first being Oblivion) but it is also personally my favorite. It's sad to see a lot of people be put off from experiencing this game due to things like ♥♥♥ graphics or a less-than stellar combat system. Certainly, the game has it's flaws, but from my perspective it trumps TES IV and V in what it does right. Morrowind is not for the faint of heart who just want to ignore any plot-lines and kill things. The game requires patience and a little bit of creativity to make the most out of it.   Being a mage sucks at first because learning spells is really expensive and magicka is a ♥♥♥♥♥ to manage in this game. Being an archer sucks at first because landing sneak attacks is finicky and whiffing all of your shots due to low agility or fatigue can be VERY frustrating. Even being a warrior sucks since melee combat can be a bit of a slog and heavy armor sucks in the early game.  But the important thing to remember in Morrowind is not to focus in one particular area of expertise, but rather try hard to excel in all of them. Quickly switching weapons and being able to cast spells on the fly makes being a diverse character infinitely easier and more enjoyable. A good warrior is bound to keep a bow around as a ranged weapon and know a spell or two to work themselves out of a difficult situation  But even more interesting than the freedom of character building is the world building of Vvardenfell. The lack of an omnipotent compass and a map that can't warp you around (gasp) make exploring the world to get things done a mandatory step in any player's journey. No spoilers, but the number of things to distract you as you journey across the island are, for the most part, all interesting and only serve to better you as a character and inform you, as the player, of the ever changing world.  TL;DR: This game requires patience, but will lead to a massive payout in story and character growth.",

            "review_text": "I gotta say, playing the elder scrolls series in reverse order, starting with skyrim, then oblivion, then morrowind, and even a little daggerfall, this series seems to amaze more and more as you go back. We start with skyrim, a game with much polish, but in comparison to its predecessors, morrowind &amp; oblivion, lacks almost a heart and soul compared to the other 2 games. All it really has on them is polish.... Thats it... nothing more honestly. Oblivion, which is sort of the middle brother in the series, is just an amazing and interesting game in its own. But i already wrote my review for that so lets get to morrowind. This game has such an authentic and unique feel that i must say, is not present in any of the other elder scrolls games. Now a days to test creative imagination people play things like minecraft, and all that. But i dont hear too many stories about morrowind and i cant understand why. In this game the only limit is your imagination, you never run out of things to do which offers infinite playability. Not only that but you constantly are wanting to create new classes because what you choose in the beginning of the game is basically what molds your gameplay for the rest of the game. Unless of course, you spellcraft (which is amazing by the way). I wont go too deep into it but if you can think of a game with magic in it, ill bet anything this game tops its magic. You can literally do anything... Wanna fly across the map and slam into the ground exploding into a massive fireball that heals you while destroying the entire world ? Not a problem! wanna go into space and visit the moon ? (okay too far) Anyways the amount of lore and depth this game has is seriously unreal and there will never be another game like it. People say the combat system sucks and isnt that complicated. The combat system in morrowind is more complicated than any of the other games. Its not just a matter of weapon damager and whether or not you hit the target. It takes into account how tired you are, how are your skills with that item, what is your strength, what is the enemies strength, how tired are they and i can go on and on and on. Due to its dateing and the fact that theres a bit of a learning curve it may be hard for some of you to really get into, but if you can get past that stuff, the gameplay will surely leave its mark on you and you will be totally engrossed...

The humor is always apparent and you even love the racist dark elves. To me it is the game to come back to when i dont know what to play and i always lose myself in it all over again. Ive finished it so many times and even though the combat feels dated, the modding community keeps it alive. No wonder they are still modding to a scale where they want to recreate it in the Skyrim engine, a multiplayer is still in the making and all of that for a game that is well over 10 years old. To me it is the perfected RPG before they became too easy. Thank god for not fast traveling, no regenerating health and for the love of god there is spellmaking to even deepen the endless possibilities. To me it is my nr.1 game of all time.

            "review_text": "As a later TES fan, you may find it hard to believe that someone who actually started with Skyrim has found Morrowind to be their favorite installment in the series. But the thing is, Morrowind has a particular charm to it, despite it being over eleven years old. There are several things I'd like to discuss about Morrowind and why you should ultimately buy it, whether you're new to the TES series, or are a die-hard fan screaming for nostalgia.  I'd like to create some points with Morrowind discussing its values:  1. Presentation 2. Gameplay 3. Overall  Ready? Let's begin.  Point One: Presentation.  At first glance, Morrowind shows its age with the early Embryo engine with skeletal animation, and an average of 800 x 600 display. Also noticable is how NPC's stay within a general area without eating, drinking, or sleeping (sounds like a serious insomnia epidemic, no?). But besides that, there's nothing really flawed about the graphics, and it's actually reminiscent of Oblivion's. This gives Morrowind a sense of familiarity to begin with. You start off the game with a cinematic intro, as you awaken on an Imperial prison ship that has docked on an Imperial colony, Seyda Neen. From there, you enter your name, choose your race, and once you enter the Commision Office, you are asked to choose your birthsign, favored attributes, and class. From there on, you are asked to deliver a message to a man named Caius, and thus your quest begins. Or at least, the main quest begins. Like other TES games, what you do there on out is up to you. Fight monsters and bandits, loot tombs and ruins, join guilds and political factions, basically what you'd expect from an open-world RPG. That said, the island of Vvardenfell is wonderful, given you can see it, with the render distance and all. Cities aren't closed in separate maps like they were in Oblivion and Skyrim, and the geography is very immersive as you walk around, looking for your objective or simply looking for a dungeon to pillage. As you walk around Vvardenfell, you will encounter strange creatures, such as the Nix-Hound, the Alit, the Netches, and the infamous Cliff Racer. Imagination was really put into these monsters, and some of them won't be so easy to kill. As for the islands residents, Vvardenfell is home to the Dunmer, the ash-skined elves you've seen in the later or earlier installments. Their culture is reminiscent to that of Asian and some tribal cultures, as they may live in the shells of ancient arthropods, adobe buildings, giant mushrooms, and nomadic tents. You will also find your typical Imperial stone structures, things you may yawn about. The in-game literature in Morrowind is very well-written, providing fictional stories to amuse you with, informative tips about the local governments, cities, and religion, and even books that hint on certain gameplay aspects such as vampirism. It truly is something to see the thought lingers in your head.   Point Two: Gameplay  As for perhaps the most important aspect of any game, the gameplay element in Morrowind is quite different from the later installments ( and definitly Arena, but we aren't comparing.) The game offers a wide variety of skills to use, with various weapon types, from typical swords and warhammers, to spears and throwing stars, to crossbows and staves. There are also a wide variety of spells to use, from your average destruction and restoration spells, to teleportation, and even flying spells. Filed Soul Gems can be used on epuipment to enchant them, and an alchemy set can be used with flora, fauna, and even raw minerals to brew potions and poisons. Dialouge with NPCs is somewhat different, though, as they will communicate with text-based responses to the selected topic, and there are many things to talk about with NPCs. The thing about dialouge is despite these many topics, what they say is usually the same as everybody else. Copy-pasted, in fact, thus rendering many NPC void of real personality, unlike Oblivion and Skyrim. As for conflict with enemies, you may either hate it or simply don't care, as it works more like D&amp;D role-playing games. Based on your skil with a certain weapon type, or the Agility attribute itself, you may miss an enemy point-blank while they take crackshots at you (though still able to miss.). Magic works similarly, as using less skilled magic type while tired out will usually result in failure to cast the spell. Aside from those questionable gameplay elements, however, there's still plenty to be had with Morrowind. You can't simply fast travel from the map so you could skip treking all the way to a destination, but rather you use public transportation, teleportation spells, and spells to increase your speed to move around Vvardenfell. Personally, this gave Morrowind a really huge look at the world map, even though it's only 10 square miles + 2-3 from the Bloodmoon expansion and about an additional one from Tribunal, compared to Cyrodill and Skyrim (16 square miles each) or even The Iilic Bay from Daggerfall, with a whopping 480,000 sqare miles (randomly generated though). Plus, you really got to know the geogrophy of Vvardenfell, as the game references landmarks and cities to help you navigate the world, all written in your little journal. Speaking of which, the journal system is probably the closest thing you'll have for a friend in this game ( besides Ahnassi, of course ). Quests and Topics are recorded on your journal with every indication. Viewing your journal is always very helpful if you've been sidetracked from looting dungeons or completing other side quests. That's not to say it isn't flawed, of course. Some quests give really bad direction and can be sometimes misleading. If you don't believe me, join House Redoran. This was really compensated in later installments with a quest marker, as a mere convinence. But don't let the gameplay issues deter you from purchasing this amazing title. Overall, the game function very well and even a late audience can find enjoyment out of it.  Point Three: Overall  Many thing can be said about Morrowind to criticize it. The fact that NPCs had nearly no personality at all, a cumbersome combat and magic system, and even some broken quests do hurt Morrowind a little bit. But despite these cons, Morrowind is uplifted with many pros. Its lore will fascinate you, the landscape will amaze you, and your impact on the game world will really matter here. You truly can be what you want, whether that be a noble knight, a malevolent mage, an infamous assassin, or a troublesome thief, Morrowind can provide.    This game has been Dubb-approved",

You play as The Nerevarine as prophesied to defeat the Dagoth Ur, who have tapped into the power of an artefact known as the Heart of Lorkhan in a bid to exert control over the inhabitants of Morrowind. This game is set predominantly on the island of Vvardenfell, just off the coast of Stonefall, in northern Morrowind.  Any hardcore Elder Scrolls fan would instantly feel at home with the rich characterisation, role-playing elements, visual details, soundtrack and the quintessential open-world environment. It is still the best of all the Elder Scrolls games, because of the magnitude of the game for its time and the back-to-basics approach in role-playing - tremendous storyline, realistic characterisation, interaction and progression.  There are weaknesses to this game however, the UI is not particularly helpful to meta-gamers (c.f. Oblivion min-maxing), the journal system whilst improved in the expansion, is still rather cumbersome to navigate, the inherent 'block' in combat can be difficult to get used to for some, as is the one-mouse-button attack and finally the graphics - this is a 2002 game, but thankfully the modding community has made graphic enhancement addons that could be easily installed and used with the game.  Overall, this game is a gem.",

Imagine three times the quests and content of Skyrim compressed into one small island, with so much lore and depth that you can lose yourself for hours and hours. Sure, it isn't a really pretty game, but slap MGSO on it and you've got an astonishingly good looking game to complement it's other aspects. You see, in Skyrim you find out you are dragonborn... cool! Yes, that means you get to incinerate people, make them fly off of cliffs etc. In Morrowind though, you start off as almost weaker than mudcrabs, but become a GOD by the end of the game, quite literally. Feel like flying around the whole map without even needing console commands? Go ahead. Want to jump like a super hero from Seyda Neen to Balmora? Do it! Kill the end game boss in one hit? Yes, you can do that. The possibilities are endless, and even though all of the above is true, that doesn't mean you're the strongest thing around, there are still monsters that are quite dangerous even in the late game, see what's different between newer entries and Morrowind? Yes, FREEDOM, to become whatever you like. Now, Morrowind isn't perfect, but it's probably the best game in the series. These days, even though it has aged well enough, it can be very difficult to get into, and since you are thrown instantly into a massive world with only a small dagger, quite confusing. But don't give up. Keep playing, and you could turn your 3 hours of frustration into your 300 hour playthrough of the best game experience you've ever had.  So I don't think I need to tell you how much I recommend this game. But as I said, it's not without flaws, it's simply that the strong points make it so amazing that you won't need to worry about the flaws. I think there is something in this game for everyone, and it's an experience that can't be missed. Grab it in the christmas sale (it's almost always on sale then), grab MGSO, also known as Morrowind Graphics and Sound Overhaul, and make sure your body is ready for one of the best PC games ever made.

THE GOOD STUFF: The world is looks beautiful (even better with mods), theres alot of cool weapons and armour types, lots of scary enemies and cool ones and the main antagonist is awsome. You can even go to Solstheim and do lots of cool stuff there that is also there in the Skyrim version of Solstheim. There is alot more good things but its hard to say them without spoiling it so go check for yourself.  THE BAD STUFF: Only few bad things was I didn't like was combat, its like rolling a dice or something to hit the enemy so if you have bad stats you will miss alot, BUT if you take time to level your stats up or go to trainers for your skills you will rarely miss, unless someone casts spells to lower your stats or you fight an enemy with high luck/agility. Ranged combat sucks even more if its not leveled up high enough, you will waste so much arrows but it does make some fights easier. Another kinda bad thing is the game is really slow compaired to the other games but you can make potions and spells or find enchanted items to make you move faster.    I reccomend this game if you love difficult RPGs and Elder Scrolls, with a few mods you can fix up all the problems and have lots of fun!",

Daggerfall is too archaic for me to want to pick up, and while I recommend the Morrowind Overhaul project, I'm playing through for my first time using only a mod to fix the resolution and loving it.   You can craft spells with EIGHT DIFFERENT EFFECTS. Want a spell mixing multiple elements and area of effect damage? You can do it. Want to summon 8 Daedric Beings with the press of a button? You can do it. Want to create a spell that heals as much as it damages, allowind you to indefinitely practice your magic on one enemy? You. Can. Do. It. All the systems in this game are about as deep as that, and alchemy requires FOUR different machines to properly do it.   The two biggest barriers to entry are the graphics and combat. Morrowind Overhaul fixes that completely so that's squared away. The combat is purely stat based; I do more damage with a mid range sword than the best most OP axe in the game, because you'll miss your swings with a weapon you have no knowledge of how to use. Also WATCH YOUR FATIGUE. % chance you hit is based on how much fatigue you have, don't be like those dumbasses who mash left mouse and wonder why they miss every swing.  Pros-   In depth lore and a wide variety of topics to ask NPCs about.  The best magic system in any game I've played.   Free form quests- I have a sword powered by the soul of a god I slew. Nobody told me to do that, Morrowind merely provides the weapon (Daedric Shortsword) the soul (not gonna spoil which god) and the means (in depth enchanting system) to do it.   Wide variety of locales and quests.   Good storytelling that isn't always spoonfed to you. To cure vampirism without looking it up online, you need to read a couple of books and figure it out yourself. As far as I know, it's impossible any other way besides discovering it by dumb luck or google.  Truly an RPG. Very easy to stick to your characters beliefs, unlike in Skyrim where the story makes you a good guy no matter what you do because you saved the world from Alduin.  Cons-  Somewhat obtuse mechanics. Once they're learned they're badass, but hard to do so. I recommend looking up how to do alchemy, enchanting, etc. as the game expects you to have an instruction manual.  Some bugs. Morrowind Overhaul fixes thousands though.  Personal Preference-   I think having to read to figure stuff out without the game just telling you is awesome. Some might not.  No quest markers. You get directions, and late game are in unexplored areas and have to go off of handwritten maps.   Conclusion-   10/10 best RPG I've ever played. Quite a challenge, but if you're up to it, it's the most rewarding game I've ever played.",

Personally I had a much better time trying to figure out how to get places based on hints and directions than just walking mindlessly towards a beacon on my map. This game is flawless, a masterpiece. Granted it does take an hour or so to get past the 'terrible' graphics. And you may one to get an HD overhaul mod or two. But with the previous set aside, RPG/Adventure games can't get any better than this.

Objectively, the graphics are very dated, and the gameplay does feel a little clunky. However if you're any fan of more classic RPG's, you need to give this game a look. Before Oblivion's more medieval landscape (Shivering Isles exheunt) and before Skyrim's Canada, Morrowind built a beautiful fantasy landscape, filled with spectacular creatures, varied characters, dwarven mechanations, and original quests.Technically speaking, the sound and graphics aren't much to speak of (though the music is adventurous, and really ups the experience). There is not much voice acting to speak of in most of this game, instead Bethesda opted for text boxes to save space. However, this opens the door for so much lore, and flavor text (which is important, damnit!) that this feels like the best crafted version of the Elder Scrolls universe.   The game isn't levelled like it's predecessors, the world stays as it is, and you start out pretty weak. But it pushes you to be strong, and if you put the time in, you can overcome every challenge. There isn't a lot of emphasis on balance, because like a classic RPG, this game doesn't hold your hand. There isn't a compass to help you find quest points, instead you have a journal which subjectively directs you to your quest goal. For example, 'The cave is north of Seyda Neen, a bit past the bridge on the river.' It feels like a real adventure, going through it.  If I were to price it: 30-Full price due to the age. But the game now can be found for incredibly cheap, I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a hard RPG experience.",

One book that you cannot live without. One book that is your life source. It records important events such as critical descisions made by the player and random events that could lead to large quests. Unlike Skyrim and Oblivion, we don't just follow arrows and markers on map or the one that floats on the objective of the quest and instead, it actually tells the player what to do and how to do it. Although puzzles are not a very big thing in TES but in Morrowind, to solve puzzles or riddles, you NEED to read the journal to figure out what to do. You will get lost without reading the Journal for certain quests and/or cannot find the quest's objective which really makes the game challenging and fun unlike in the other TES games, they are too casualized and all players need to do is follow the annoying marker that TELLS them what to do instead of the player FIGURING out what to do. - It has the class system that does not exist in Skyrim, which is ridiculous for a TES game. Players need to plan what they need to do to instead of leveling up all skills freely and at the same speed even though Skyrim has those stupid Standing Stones which some of them boosts the leveling rate of skills. Players need to get proper gear for their proper class. Although Custom Class is available in Morrowind, players need to do the same. Even Oblivion and the old TES games, Arena and Daggerfall has it. Overally the class system is VERY important for a TES game.  That is all I should say for now and I highly recommend any TES gamer to buy this game.

Your character can be crafted in any way you want...stealth, melee, ability to mend your own gear, magic (so many spells).  The game can still crash but I found the steam version much better than having the game on disc (less crashy)...saving often is a must. There is also no real hand holding, so paying attention to your world, increasing your skills and reading (the conversations, books, your journal) will point you in the right direction (maybe...I did die a few times before I got the hang of the game). Absolute must play for rpg fans.",

The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind is and will be for a long time a game in my top 5 best games of all time list. If you are looking for a game to waste hours of your life on Morrowind is the game for you. Mind you it doesn't have the same feel as Skyrim or Oblivion and it is a game that is still selling copies on copies a decade after its release in 2002/2003, it is a fantastic title worth the buy.",

If you don't, read this review (NOTE THAT THERE WILL BE SPOILERS):  Morrowind is a creatively-crafted, replayable game with great storylines and gameplay. You start out as a mere, useless outlander and work your way up. This game by no means gives you a title. No matter what quest you do, you must be powerful enough to become the next rank in a guild. The main quest doesn't hold your hand and is relatively harder compared to modern RPS. The combat, the skill system, it's great, yet not perfect. Trust me when I tell you that this game will not be over quick. I became Nerevarine of all tribes and Hortator of all houses... and I was pronounced a heretic and hated by many.

I remember that prisoner in the ship telling you that he thinks 'We've arrived in Morrowind, I'm sure they'll let us go.' then being led off by an Imperial guard, creating your character, and stepping out into the large alien island of Vvardenfell. A province of Morrowind. i remember seeing all the betty netches and berry netches floating around thinking 'What the hell are these things?' As well as walking into Balmora and seeing that huge flea shaped Silt strider. To me, this game was a mixture of medievel and alien culture, offering unique landscapes, animals, ingredients and a rich taste of Dunmer culture. I remember arriving in Caius Cosades house, where he is confused as to the instructions of 'Reporting to Caius Cosades'. I remember waking up in his home after having slept, and being attacked by a Dark Brotherhood Assassin, and in the process of taking hits at the black armoured intruder, accidently hit Caius, causing him to cast a magic spell at me and kill me. I remember one day when I was sick, I sat down at my computer, and attempt to fulfill Caius's first task: Go talk to a man at the Fighters Guild and find out about the 'Neravarine prophecies' and about 'Dagoth Ur' subjects I had no knowledge or understanding of. After having travelled across Balmora to meet the guy, I was told to go to a dwemer ruin and collect a 'Puzzle box' for the man himself. I remember fighting a bunch of bandits while there, and thinking what a strange place I was in. I remember exploring different towns, before oneday, I was instructed to head to Vivec to talk to 3 people about the subjects Caius had an interest in. I remember watching the large canton of the Foreign Quarter render into view as I walked towards, and remember exploring the huge buildings while being greeted by the gold armoured Ordinators in a rude manner. I remember exploring the West Gash region, and coming across a naked nord, wanting 'revenge on a witch' and then as we were heading up north, we got seperated. I remember arriving at the city of Ald-Ruhn just as an Ash storm was setting in. Being asked by a woman at the entrance to 'find her husband'. Well. To sum up this entire review, I will just say that this game has excellant creativity, and stands out against all the other RPG games as a 'creative, original, unique and fascinating game' and brings a whole culture with it. I would definitely suggest this game, however if you're an Elder Scrolls fan whos only played Oblivion or Skyrim, you may get frustrated by the 'hit and miss' combat mechanics. Or the fact that you have to use your brain more when it comes to quests and finding your way around.",

Personally, I never had a problem with the combat system like others seem to have had. But, with just looking at the base content it is so vast I've never 'completed' (If completing it can technically be done). I have finished the main quest though.  But, the DLC's equal nearly an entire new game. They're also very very vast.  My most proud 'achievement' is modding the base character to have Vivecs Levitation Spell as a gift to the character. Nothing like being able to levitate the entire map until you get killed by a Cliff Racer.  4000/10 Will levitate to death again.   *Note*, not played Morrowind since I got it on Steam as if you notice...

I was able to go backwards from Skyrim to Oblivion, but for some reason I have found it more difficult to get immersed in this game. The graphics are not a problem for me, although admittedly they haven't aged well. The conversations with NPC's require you to read as there is not much voice acting. I don't mind because I like to read, but it is time consuming.  My fascination with the elders scrolls series in general keeps me interested in playing this game, although I am finding that I have to really push myself through the beginning. I feel that Morrowind immerses you into the world in a way that Skyrim and Oblivion do not. I find myself suddenly interested in not only the quests, but learning every detail about the world around me. This game requires your attention, and there is no quest markers or fast travel like there is with the newer games, so you are essentially forced to explore the world around you, which I enjoy.  That being said, I find the journal to be very confusing and the inventory to be difficult to navigate. The combat system is also very annoying, and I find that I need to click several times in order to get a lucky hit which I am not used to. I am aware that some of these complaints can be fixed by mods, but keep in mind that this game was released long before Nexus Mod Manager, and most mods you are going to need to install manually. I still cannot get the script extender to work on my computer, although I am not tech savvy so this is my fault. If I was able to mod this game better, I would probably enjoy it as much as Skyrim.  But overall, I can tell that I'm going to really like this game once I get used to it. I had a little bit of a hard time with Oblivion, but I ended up enjoying it more than Skyrim. If you're new to playing it, but you've played old RPG's in the past, I strongly recommend that you push through the beginning! It gets more interesting as you go on.

It is a unique experience that, although dated by today's standards, presents a beautiful sprawling world that the player can experience in almost any way they see fit. It consistently rewards curiosity and exploration with loot and lore crammed into corners where most people would never look. It doesn't showcase the 'balanced' difficulty of the later elder scrolls games but in my mind that is a great advantage... it forces the player to really plan and manipulate all their available tools to survive an area that should really be too difficult for them. Similarly, as the player grows in strength, there is a point at which many of the enemies are fodder rather than a challenge, this takes a while to achieve and is actually feels really rewarding.   While it hasn't necessarily aged well, there are plenty of mods that can bring things up-to-date without to much hassle.   I wouldn't say Morrowind is perfect, especially nowadays, but it still holds a lot of its original charm. If you can get over the first couple humps of difficulty, there's a lot of worthwhile content, characters and environments to explore.",

There is no magical arrow in the sky showing you where to go, and even the smallest of encounters can be deadly. Fast travel exists only in the form of paid transports, running everywhere will render you too exhausted to fight effectively, untrained spells will fail and unpracticed attacks will miss. But this is what makes Morrowind special; a truly fantastic, alien, landscape, real challenges, complex plotlines requiring real choices and tests of loyalty and skill instead of 'follow the magic arrow to the next cutscene'.  11/10.",

            "review_text": "Ah, yes, we've been expecting you. You'll have to be convinced before you officially buy the game. There are a few reasons for you to do this and the choice is yours:  - Deep Story:  From the main quest all the way down to simple side quests, you feel like you are actually making an impact. Most of the quests are not simple fetch quests that tell you to go to X and retrieve Y, with many of them including decision making, puzzle solving, betraying, ect...  - Realistic: About as realistic as you can get when you are involving monsters and magic into the game. One of the first things that comes to mind is the magic system, where you had to think about your use of magicka as not to run out in the middle of combat and have to chug potions or use enchanted items to replenish it. One thing many people didn't enjoy was the rolling to hit, but I did like it and it could be a very good system with some updated animations to be able to show slight shifts of the enemy which causes your blade to hit their armor instead of the Morrowind system where you keep stabbing until you hit. The disposition system more depth to the game, as increasing it may unlock dialog options or allow you to get a reduced price from merchants. Also on disposition, npcs will remember your character, and if you did something they don't agree with (for example morag tong vs thieves guild) they may not discuss certain topics with you, not talk at all with you, or attack you on sight.  - Roleplaying: There are so many ways that you can roleplay your character. Want to be a classic high elf/atronach mage? Done. How about a dark elf thief? Sure. What about a breton warrior? Why not? the choices go on and on as there is no real way to play the game 'wrong' You could meta game and use certain race bonuses to your advantage, like the 'classic' options for class/race combinations, but it is entirely possible to make a stealthy orcish thief, or a powerful redguard mage.   - Advancement:  You start off worse than dirt. You are pushed around by rats and mudcrabs. You are barely able to stab anything with your terrible iron dagger, let alone cast spells. But as you get more experienced, these rats are no longer a challenge, and you move on to ever more dangerous enemies, until you are killing the gods themselves. In Morrowind you really feel you are advancing, especially with mages as they are capable of breaking the game with enchantments and alchemy. But the real fun in Morrowind is not in the beginning, where you are weaker than a mudcrab, but for me it is in the advancement itself. Sure, it is fun to roast all of Balmora with one spell, but the most enjoyable part of the game is in getting powerful. Once you are powerful enough to jump across vvardenfell, while simultaineously raining fireballs with rediculous aoe down on your foes, you are powerful enough to retire, and start as something new.  - Replay Value: Morrowind has tons of replay value, since every game you play you will encounter new npcs, new quests, and new dialog options. Finished as a fighter character after joining house redoran and fighting your way up the ranks in the fighters guild? Try a thief who joins house hlaalu and the morag tong. With the ammount of guilds and quests in this game you will never finish every single one of them. It would be hard to fill in the entire map, let alone finish all the quests. But if you are getting bored of doing the same guild quests and main quest again, that is when you can get mods. Morrowind rebirth adds an entire new area full of npcs, and more importantly quests, for you to explore.  Interesting. Before you purchase the game make sure this information is correct:  - Summing Up:  Morrowind is a deep, rich rpg where you actually have an impact on the world. It is about as realistic as it could get with what it includes. Advancement feels meaningful and deserved. There are many options for roleplaying, as well as tons of replay value.

The real reason I bought this game was because I figured that since it was an old game I wouldn't deal with lag or anything (which I don't of course). It turns out it truly is worth $20. I have so far been to Mournhold, 'City of Light, City of Magic!' To Fort Frostmoth, and Balmora; among many dozens other places. But that is the only few I can think of right now off the top of my head :P   The combat really does suck for awhile until you can get a skill ranked up enough, then after that it's very fun to just charge up to a barbarian near Fort Frostmoth and pretend it's the movie 'Centurion' by slaughtering every single barbarian in sight but trying to stay near or run to a safe place so as not to get overwhelmed (by the way if you have never watched Centurion you should it's one of the best movies ever). Other than one part at the beginning where you have to make your name and race and all that jazz it is a truly open-world game that always has some kind of twist in the middle of almost every single mission that you would have never expected.

At first I didn't believe them. How could a game from 2003 compare to a game from 2006 (Oblivion) or 2011? So I saw it on sale at a modest price, and I bought it. Am I glad I made that purchase? Hell yeah.  What a video game Morrowind is. It hasn't aged particularly well, I admit*, but the game underneath the 2003 visuals is something that still worth a look at. A huge look in fact. Yes, while it isn't as packed with content as much as it's newer releases, it still has enough for you to dedicate a sizeable potion of your free time to complete. Some of the mechanics in Morrowind would be seen as 'outdated' or 'products of its time', I personally felt like these mechanics were more relaxing while wandering around the island of Vvardenfell, but also had the potential to challenge you in combat. Remember, this game came out in 2003, so it's no surprise to find out that it has 2003 video game hard difficulty at times. If you make the same mistake I did and come into Morrowind, hoping to have as simple a time as Skyrim or Oblivion, you're gonna have a bad time.  However, these little difficulty issues or content shortages don't impact too much on the quality of the game here. Morrowind is quickly becoming one of my favourite games on PC and certainly one of my favourite Bethesda games.  *Downloading the Morrowind Overhaul Mod mostly fixes those ugly textures and soft lighting issues though.",

Even if it's graphics aren't as good as Skyrim's graphics, at the time Morrowind was created, its graphics were legendary. The quests are even more detailed in Morrowind; heck, almost anything non-graphics-related is more detailed in Morrowind than Skyrim. The two games are barely comparable to each other, but because the subject is in debate, this is the general mindset, so taking an approach to a review by comparison is the best way I can recommend this game.  If you don't have this game, and only play TESV: Skyrim, and call yourself a huge Elder Scrolls fan/geek, then you have seen nothing, my friend. Buy this game and play it.

So I start walking through this boat, and I start hearing this beautiful theme music, Nerevar rising, I would later find out. But for now I knew it as that song with the drums that went 'NA NA NAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA, NA NA NAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA, NA NA NAAAA NA NA NAAAAAAAA' and immediately found myself humming it. I let myself out of the ship and created my character (A broadsword toting redguard) and set off.  First opinions from that? I believe my thought process was, Okay so there's little to no voice acting, I can cope. Okay, so dunmer don't like me. Okay so-HOLY CRAP A GIANT BUG??

That being said, here is my review:   This game is a masterpiece. It is the most in-depth, and most immersive, RPG of all time. While I love all of the Elder Scrolls games, this one is a step above the others. There is much more to do, and it gives you more freedom than any other games in the series. Morrowind felt like a living, breathing, world that you were actually inside. This being a Bethesda game, it is extremely buggy though, which can kill immersion. The world feels endless, and there is no way you will see every place, and do every quest, in less than 3000 hours. 100 hours in, 90% of your map will still be unexplored. Morrowind is the only Elder Scrolls game that lets you do things like make your own spells, leading to the craziest outcomes that no other player has ever seen. Sure the graphics and sound are outdated, and the combat is annoying at first, but that isn't the point. Morrowind will make you feel like you visiting another planet, and lets you become whoever you want. Unlike in Skyrim, where you are the chosen one with a destiny to kill Alduin, in Morrowind you are an ordinary person. There is nothing special about you, you don't have a 'destiny' to do anything, and you are a foreigner that everyone looks down upon at first. As you play though, you will gain reputation, either good or bad. This depends on how you play the game, and will effect your entire experience. Morrowind is huge compared to Cyrodil or Skyrim, and I'm not saying that because of the lack of fast travel (which I don't think was a really a good or bad thing in later installments, just a different experience). The soundtrack, though small, completely fits the game and remains one of my favorites. There are flaws in this game though (other than the ones I have already mentioned). The dialogue is terrible, (though more immersive) the journal system was confusing, the leveling system can easily be exploited, the dungeons are dull, and some of the AI is really dumb. Overall though, the games strengths easily make up for all the faults. Morrowind is the perfect game for anyone that likes open world RPGs. 9.8/10",

My first Elder Scrolls was Skyrim, and as Oblivion and Morrowind went on sale I bought those too. Morrowind is my absolute favourite, despite the fact that when I started I was killed by a slaughterfish and a mudcrab.  In Skyrim, and to an extent Oblivion, you start out average and work your way up to being great. In Morrowind you start out terrible, work your way up to average, and them become well-nigh invincible. And the sense of satisfaction that comes with that is absolutely unreal.  Sure the graphics might not be incredible, and the combat might be frustrating, but once you've sunk a few hours into it you won't even notice. And if there's something about the game you don't like, there's a mod for that!  In short form: Get this game, have some patience, give it some time to grow on you, and become a god.",

It takes some time to get into it, you start off as a nobody, not even shopkeepers like you, and refuse to sell you stuff. You may play it now and wonder why people like this so much, but the magic of Morrowind is the fact that this game makes you work to get what you want. It doesn't warn you about the high level areas, and there's not fast travel. But when you accomplish something, it feels amazing! I played it before it came on steam, a long, long time ago, and I was as surprised as I was back when I first played this game, after all those years.

However, Morrowind is not for everyone... if you come into TESIII after having played either TESIV or TESV, it's very likely you will not be able to enjoy it. Also, you need to come into the game with an open mind, and realizing that combat is probably less than 1% of this game. The charm instead lies in the world it lets you explore, and no other game presents you with a world as wonderous and immersive as this game does.  Put it this way... if you feel your entry-level quest in the mage guild should involve saving the entire guild of master wizards from some terrible evil, then you might want to go into Skyrim instead. However, if you feel you'd prefer a more realistic (and immersive) introduction quest that involves exploring the surroundings, picking mushrooms from the sides of trees... well, then Morrowind is literally the only game ever made that will scratch that itch... sucks to be me =/.",

I know this game is old but the could have been a a few more regular swings like Skyrim but I like the higher level, higher chance of hitting feature but the combat needs to be more varietied. With the Overhaul Mod it is a decent standard and you get used to it and therefore is fine. There is also lots of weapons which makes up for it. The is a long and immersive story with quests that require you to use your mind as well as interactive characters which have a rating on how much they like you which impacts on prices, clues to quests and if they will give you usefull things for a quest like a potion or weapon. In the gameplay the is also a magic side to things with potions, spells and enchanting also makes a huge amount more of things to do. To see the is many cities and settlements dotted around with various means of travel to get there and many quests and things to loot whilst your there. This is a masterpiece, even more so with the Morrowind Overhaul 2.0 which you should buy sale price or not as this also comes with two gameplay packed expansions which adds tonnes more as well as the game on its own. This game packs about 125+ hours for just 12.99 which you may think is much for an old game but with or without Morrowind Overhaul 2.0 it is worth buying.  Presentation: 10.0 Graphics: 10.0 Sound: 8.5 (The voice acting gets repetetive after some time) Game-play: 7.5 (The combat and gameplay can be quite slow and seem like its not progressing at times) Lasting Appeal: 10.0 Overall Rating: 9.2  Overall, this is one of the best and most immersive games of all time. Nothing beats the game world and how the soundtrack and the game world blend together. The games soundtrack is also one of the best I have ever heard and as I said, fits the game perfectly. Bethesda's masterpiece in my opinion.",

Forget Oblivion and forget Skyrim, pick up any of the HD packs for Morrowind and some other essentials like a journal mod, the seamless bodies mod and a good homebase and you're set for playing the best Elder Scrolls game to date.  The story is decently long and progressive. The game plays like a CRPG, so you need to immerse yourself in the world to play it, no quest markers and no extensive journal support. Tag-based conversations and limitless exploration without loading screens means you'll really need, and by the end of it, really enjoy, the freedom the game gives you. The only thing it does alert you for is if you kill a vital quest NPC, but aside from that, you have free reign. You need to remember names, you need to learn locations and generally get a good feel for the world.. and that's a good thing.  You won't be chasing markers on the map like a cat chasing a laser pointer, you'll actually be surprised by that daedric ruin or hidden dungeon. You'll need to learn to move around using fragmented fast travel. Yes you can fast travel, but considering the multiple options of transportation, it's like moving around the city using bus/tram/walking to get from point A to point B. Minus certain spells, you will need to learn the transportation 'map' of the game. To note, the map size isn't gargantuan, but it doens't need to be, and areas are rarely placed for filler.  A note of warning regarding the gameplay though, it is dice based, not physical based. So if you hit an enemy with a weapon, unless you hear the 'clink' of hitting and the damage applying, you missed, and when you start out, you'll be missing a lot. Spells hit all the time if they hit though so take that into consideration. Aside from these mentions, the rest is best left to be learned.   This is as much an RPG as a survival game when you start out. From petty freshly-released prisoner to walking demigod, you will actually feel the character getting stronger, and you'll know it will be because you chose to made him stronger, not because of you just ate food off a plate prepared for you.    Closing up, if you're coming into the series from Oblivion, or worse, Skyrim, you'll replace that ocean with the depth of a drop with a lake, indeed, but one you could sink in for days instead of just dipping your toes in for a few minutes.

            "review_text": "Okay, so the first thing you need to know about Morrowind is that it is an old game from that classic era of PC gaming where the solution to most interface problems was 'let's add more menus'. The controls are clunky, the running speed is unbearably slow and the graphics are outdated. But that doesn't matter because you can change all of that with a combination of console commands, mods and good old fashion THIS GAME IS GREAT.  Story is the absolute best of any Elder Scrolls game in my opinion. The world is the coolest, and even though it's older, it's still absolutely huge. Your goal in this game, you ask? Oh, well you're just going to become the REINCARNATION OF A GOD. WITH GOD POWERS. YOU BECOME IMMORTAL. That is way cooler than stopping some gods from invading Cyrodil or killing a few dragons, seriously. You also get to meet the only Dwemer still alive (that we know of), which is pretty cool too. The expansions are very good--not Shivering Isles level of hype but still respectable in their own rights. Bloodmoon adds werewolves and Solstheim, which you may know from Skyrim, and Tribunal adds addition content after you complete the game.  If you're coming from Skyrim or Oblivion, Morrowind...isn't like that. At all. Imagine the racism of Skyrim combined with the actual RPG elements of Oblivion and you'll get somewhere close to where Morrowind is on the spectrum. It's tough to get into when you're coming from the moden era of gaming, and Morrowind desperately needs a remake just so that the newer generation can understand it's hype. Hell, if they were coming out with an official Morrowind remake, I would be the first in line. Check out Skywind in the meantime, and while you're at it, buy Morrowind because it's on sale all the time, because it's one of the best classic RPGs of all time, because the story is absolutely beautiful and the world is consistent...buy it. Just buy it. You won't regret it.",

A few weeks later I decided to give It another go. I also decided to install the Morrowind overhaul 3.0 (***HIGHLY RECCOMENDED***). Mainly for the visual boost it gave, but also because it comes with alot of bug and balance fixes.  Now I can say that I'm a big fan of the game. And I can now reccomend the game but as I said.

Lack of quests? There are whole questlines waiting for you.  Jeremy Soule`s OST is still, in my opinion, the best music ever created for a game.

For me, the game is a lot better than Skyrim and this is not for the nostalgia goggles. The game has many weird and/or bad aspects. The combat mechanic is based on the power of RNG. For a first person action RPG, this is a bad idea. The graphics are very varied. Actors are normally ugly, while we have some trully beautiful buildings that, even now, I cannot find a match. What this game offers, that Skyrim does not, is simple: better Main story, better world building and amazing atmospere.   I do not want to go too deep into detail, so I will finish this with the reasons I play the game, as generic as possible. Skyrim has a better gameplay and is more enjoyable to relax in. Morrowind has a better world and story and it is more enjoyable to experience and play. Oblivion has best DLC and has Sheogorath, the Mad God.  In all cases, follow the path of modding and make the game cry in agony from the modding.  P.S. Skyrim Special Edition is a silly idea, built from complete laziness.",

It's vast, and it feels like it never ends. The many hours you spend playing weave together an incredibly detailed and enriching story that is part of a much larger cosmology that connects and encompasses the entire Elder Scrolls series. You can spend hours just reading the in-game books alone. If you are even remotely interested in role-playing or adventure games, then this is a must-have, as well as its descendents, Oblivion and Skyrim (as of 2013).  For those who are more familiar with Oblivion or Skyrim, this is a more difficult game with a much steeper learning curve. Your character will move slowly at first, will run out of fatigue very quickly (unlike in Skyrim, fatigue is depleted by running and is much more of a factor in how successful all your actions will be), and you will be unable to carry or store much loot. It will take a while to level up and increase your skills at first, but be patient, and you will soon notice that things really do get easier.  Morrowind also seems considerably longer than either Oblivion or Skyrim, because there are many more factions you can join, and each has several questgivers (assuming you want more than just the main quest, which is also lengthy). The other thing you need to know is that there is NO fast-travel in this game. Be prepared to spend a lot of time traveling on foot. But these things just add to the challenge and depth of this classic game. When given a dungeon to explore, you won't get a convenient arrow pointing you to the exact location; often, you'll just be told 'it's southwest from X' and it's up to you to find it. This adds to the realism and the immersion.  As if the vanilla game weren't enough, there are two expansion packs included in the GOTY edition that are bound to add many enjoyable hours to your experience, as well as tons of free mods out there to spice things up. The price you pay for this game is nothing compared to the months or years of solid, fun role-playing it provides.",

Spells hod a similar system where the spell had a chance not to cast at all. The main part of the game is exploration. With no fast travel system other than the Silt Strider you'll find yourself walking almost everywhere, because the Silt Strider costs monry for every use. The immense number of side quests originated in this entry, and has been every newer entry, including ESO (Elder Scrolls Online). Morrowind is challenging and downright unforgiving at times, so it could be quite hard to go back to playing, ecpecially after playing Skyrim. Altogether The Elder Scrols III Morrowind is my favorite in the twenty year old series, and in my opinion earned a 10/10 score in 2002, and even now holds up to the 10/10 score.",

Well, they won me over eventually, but it did take some doing. I was mostly bored but then caught myself thinking about the game when I wasn’t playing it. I appreciate how the game demands your attention and how you need to remember names and places instead of just following floating markers on your screen. There were some really fun characters and the was some story sections were built was intriguing. For an example there was a task you needed to complete with several factions but the approach you had to take was always different depending on the people you were dealing with. The game has a ton of dialogue and lore and that is definitely its charm and strong point. On the other hand it quickly turned into just walking around in an empty world repeatedly killing the same enemies pestering you. My 50-hour-long playthrough had a lot of fun and captivating moments and the world of Morrowind had some really interesting places to offer. Still, those were just the highlights in a quite tiresome journey and I can’t help but wonder how much it had to do with the game’s age.",

I wish and hope they add it too futuire elder scrolls games as it adds to the realism and environment of the game plus the combat system is more challenging in this game compared to future installments as it has a percentage ratio on the chance you have of hitting your enemy, the ratio is higher as you level up ( i think).

The odd hipocrasies one will find within, equally mirrors reality in all it's many forms - From Dagoth Ur and the N'wahs to the irreplacable beauty of Telvanni Towers, it is a story mirred in reality in as much fiction.  With Morrowind, no matter ones class, caste, origin, or any other determining factor, one is merely a person. How absolutely profound. One is not God. One is not destined for greatness or glory, someone merely is. The world itself exists, and the person who choses it, exists within. There is no endless prophecy that one is required to fill, and indeed the prophecy that does exist, can be fulfilled by mistake - the world itself questions which path is correct and rewards erring.  As a person within this world, you will find many things mundane, yet inexplicably exciting. The scenery is gorgeous and filled with meaning under every stone. This world is slow, and sleepy - yet homey, and comfortable not unlike one's bed. Indeed, search any house in the game and find how lovingly things were placed, with intent - candles, pillows, books, and pots, all carefully placed by the inhabitiants. The people who live within this world can often be as hostile as they are pleasant, and as you make friends and influence enemies, you will find your story has unfolded quite unlike any other - as a thief, mage, fighter, Poet-Warrior or otherwise, where the small successes of many failures will reward you with a level of satisfaction quite unlike any other. This world rewards those with perserverance and time, punishing those who rush and come unprepared without Kagrenac's tools, again the most important of which is time.  Morrowind is a game and world that demands only time. Not attention, nor thought, nor really any clever wit; merely time to experience and enjoy even when void of understanding. The real tools of this game are patience for it's mechanics, it's loveable and maddening quirks, but more importantly it's infinite flaws that are indeed features of life within. Approach it with an open mind, and time to spare, and Morrowind will show you a world in strife with lasting peace on it's horizon. Who will you be? Or more interestingly; will you even choose to be? This is the question Morrowind will ask of you. Do you wish to be God, like the Tribunal? Do you wish merely to exist and experience the world as it was crafted, living within? Or perhaps the secrets of Divine must be uncovered; where the alternate possibilites of truth are found - where in the story becomes deeper and more divided, a truth crafted only by your belief or disbelief of it.  If you have a love of knowledge, of life, of lore - Morrowind reflects it with the detailed books and believable religions that anchor it to reality; though of course in a metaphorical sense, as surely Sharmat is not the devil incarnate, nor is Vehk abhrahemic.   Morrowind is as much reality as we choose it to be; for those in doubt one must simply consult the concepts of CHIM and CODA. Surely it's all in good fun, however these concepts will enable an appreciation of Morrowind far beyond the basic and mundane levels most enjoy. These concepts are what make the concept of a Dragon-Break, as much reality as we chose them to be. The lore is rich and fluid beyond anyone's wildest imaginings, and indeed the concepts it present make it almost seem as though it were a dream realized only by us, the inhabitants who choose it to be realize, or deny it life.  Without a doubt, the most comprehensive, satisfyingly maddeningly difficultly easy game ever meticulously crafted by the hands of men and surely a gift of the Godhead above.   Submit to the three, Thy Spirits and Thy Lords; Blessings of Vivec be upon you, Muthsera.  Signed,  (The writing is in Dunmeri, but seems illegible. Who could've written this? It's impossible to tell.)",

I've got a good six hours into this game and haven't even scraped the surface of the sheer amount of content in this game. The soundtrack is perfect and adds atmosphere to the world created by Bethesda. I have been attacked by the dark brotherhood, joinen the fighters guild and explored a dwarven ruin, and I enjoyed every moment of it. This game ages very well and looks gorgeous even with the technological limitations of that time. A great advantage over skyrim that I encountered is the speech. It lets you talk about ANYTHING that has happenend! Skyrim now feels a little strange when I cant ask about Where the cornerclub is. One thing about this game that could be improved is the magic. But as this was corrected in later games, I won't dwell on it. The best thing about this g.ame for me is the enemies. If you notice, the majority of Skyrim is mammals, which arent very exiting. Morrowins has many exiting creatures that make me say: 'HOLY CRAP WTF IS THAT?!?!?!?!' Instead of skyrim, which is:'oh, a bear.' All in all, Amazing game.Now, I'll give this game two ratings. A rating for today, and one for release date. Release date: 10/10 Today's Date:9.5/10 Due to Bugs and Combat issues",

Reason for this is because I found some bear hide on one of my other guys, so I made a Khajjit and named him Bear-Cat, didn't even bother to use the dock, and just used console commands to:   1. Walk on water  2.Make my speed and every other attribute above 10000  After I got my clothes, I made an oath to eat everything I find.  I had eaten so many things I think I had over the effect limit(seemed like it, was going almost to my minimap). I had so many effects my friend(who is a Elderscrolls veteran, he's been playing Morrowind esp since 2005. also he has everything in the game without cheats) couldn't identify them all.   Then came the day, I slaughtered a pig. I found some bristle-back leather. Seems like a fancy snack, so I ate it. To my surprise it gave me infinite blindness. Not even the most powerful console commands could make it go away, not even magic spells. I then couldn't see anything so I just left the game. Bear-Cat will forever be in my heart.  After that(a few weeks ago) I made a guy named Halgor the Old, and called it a day. He looked somewhat decent, but the Morrowind characters basically represent spawns of satan himself; so there aren't really any 'nice' looking characters without mods.   I made him a legit character, and completed my first mages guild quest. It was very satisfying, considering I had to walk like 100 million miles there and back. I got back and waited for my next quest.  New quest, yay!--wait, you're joking, right?   This guy wanted me to walk basically to the other quarter of the map. I'm like: 'Screw this, peace out homies!'   Also there's some pretty creepy looking lady in the mages guild.",

            "review_text": "I've played this game more than any other game in my life (probably) Best game in the series in my opinion. Keep in mind i've only played Daggerfall for about an hour or 5. Reasons for this: -Classes and creating your own class -It actually feels like you're in a diffrent, odd world that demands exploration, unlike Oblivion and Skyrim which feel like the backyard of Canada, considering i live in michigan its not much of a change. -The naritive doesn't force you to do things, for example you can start the game and ignore the main quest and the game won't resent you for it, its much better for role playing. Unlike in skyrim everyone is going to call you the dragon born even if you're trying to roleplay a harmless monk or something. -Spell crafting and enchanting at its best, Oblivion did a good job with this too though. -THE MOST IMPORTANT REASON: NO QUEST MARKERS, can't just look at an arrow and go to it, quests, and the location of the quest is indicated in your journal with directions, for example: 'North east of [some location] you will see a [landmark] now travel north of that and you will find [quest thing]', i ♥♥♥♥ing love it, feels much more real and immersive actually having to search for ♥♥♥♥ instead of just going for an arrow on a compass. Goes very well with my next point: -No fast travel, you can't just click on your map and be there, you have to pay for rides on creatures, or teleportations from mage guild to mage guild, then from that point (usually a city or town of some kind) you can go find what you're looking for. Once again more immersive and roleplay-ee -The people and places are intersting -the religions are interesting and worth learning about -the clan feuds are interesting -The cults are interesting, i never really figured out thier teleporters -you can oversee the building of your own town in the blood moon expansion, choosing what buildings to place where etc. -SOOOOOOOO MANY AMAZING MODS, i even made some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ones back in the day. Think the game hasn't aged well? Graphical mods galore, you can make it look about as good as oblivion. My favs: Better Bodies, Better Clothes V1.1, Better heads bloodmoon and tribunal addon, Blasphemous Revenants, Chalk30, New argonian/Khajiit bodies, Ranger Tent, Abigail's Pet Shop, Complete Morrowind, Construction mod, Antares' Big Mod 5.",

Morrowind has been lauded as the best game of the TES series by some. I started with Skyrim, which is my favorite game of all time, then played Oblivion, Morrowind and a bit of ESO. Morrowind is, in THIS series #2 in my opinion, and Oblivion was shockingly bad for me. Expect nothing and you will have fun.  Morrowind is old now. I remember when the game “Pong” was new and how awesome Space Invaders was when it came out but that doesn't mean I still play them now. Morrowind's graphics are archaic, and the landscape is rather empty and a bit “angular”. On the other hand, I like the theme and the visual aesthetic – especially the architecture. I also like the concept behind the main quest, but after playing newer games, the quests leading you into the story don't build interest or motivation to continue. Granted, I'm used to faster-paced, modern games, but the side quests feel like mere time killing devices that provide time to get stronger before the end.   NPC are horrifyingly random and lifeless. Important dialog is written, so npc only speak only random, ambient lines. Everyone in the game, from nobles, to guards, to beggars, keeps saying over and over 'I could kill that Guar (type of beast). Those boots are ruined.' No dialog at all would have been better. The written dialog options were okay, but even after a quest is completed, you'll have the old dialog options littering up the dialog window, so finding the options you actually need is frustrating. You may as well not talk to anyone at all and use Google to navigate through your quests.  Morrowind combat is nothing like more recent Bethesda games. It's based on the roll of a die; not the player's actual gaming skill. In a word, it's rubbish key-smashing until you kill something or run out of potions and die. I will go so far as to say that such a combat system never belonged in a video game at all. I didn't expect I'd be buying the Elder Scrolls version of D&amp;D.  Magic using is brutal...just an awful, horribly painful system. Magicka does not regenerate without sleeping long enough to recover it, and your pool of magicka is very limited. Perhaps by the end of the game you'll have built up a big enough magicka pool to use your spells, but by then...who cares? The only way to play as a mage is to cheat with mods that regenerate your magicka... or to spend days trying and failing to make magicka potions. It's clear that magic was made to be used as a backup to other forms of combat or...running away?  I have many complaints about this game, but the theme, open-world, and game aesthetic are strong. With a ton of mods Morrowind is enjoyable for a few hours at a time. Just wait until it's on sale.",

Vvardenfell Morrowind throws you (the Outlander) into the alien setting of Vvardenfell, an island in the North East of Morrowind. The land itself was to players back in 2003 as alien as it is to players today. The setting is a unique one ; volcanic wastes, giant mushroom trees and coastal mud flats are but a few. The folks at Bethesda truly managed to make a memorable setting that is still special when compared to all the other RPGs released in the 14 years since its launch. Its a joy to explore and the mystery of the entire island is a driving force. There is always more to explore and even more to find. The world is filled with caves, ruins and small settlements. Part of the joy of Morrowind is the exploration of the game ; its a truly open world that doesn't feel like its empty.  The Outlander When you arrive in Seyda Need in the first five minutes of the game, you're scum. You're filth in the eyes of the citizens. However, as you progress, your impact will be felt by many. NPCs may reference an impact of one of your actions in a quest. You feel like you're actually a part of the world. Your decisions matter as opposed to those of other games. You feel like you're progressing (there is so level scaling so you're actually becoming stronger and not being made to fight enemies at the same level as you). This helps add to the world ;a place might be dangerous for you initially, but 20 levels later you've grown enough to challenge it , adding to the hostile feeling of Morrowind.

After purchasing the game I found that there is no wide screen resolution for the game, which I'm fine with by itself, but the game also resets all settings, including controls and resolution upon starting the game. Again alone this isn't a huge problem, although it is irritating having to go through the settings and rebind all of the controls every time I start the game. However, this also means that the game can't be run in windowed mode. This leads to the screen being stretched and the game looking much worse than it should, and means that I cannot alt tab out of the window without fear of the game crashing.  I think that these problems may only be an issue due to a recent update to windows 10. Up until recently the issues I had were fixed by the Morrowind Graphics Extender, and without it the game at least saved my settings when exiting and reopening the game. Now MGE doesn't run, and crashed on both my PC and laptop, (both running windows 10), and after removing MGE I still couldn't get the games original settings to work.  The only thing that changed on both my PC and Laptop since i last played he game is a windows 10 update, so i'm assuming the problem is something to do with that.",

            "review_text": "Morrowind is the 2002 RPG brought by Bethesda, touted to a cult-classic status. Over the years, as ever more casual sequels with ever more cut aspects have released, Morrowind (and to a lesser extent Daggerfall) has been hailed as the pinnacle of the series by a famously rabid following.  I didn't play Morrowind with any mods, so this review is of the completely vanilla, raw version published by Bethesda on Steam. Also the first playthrough, so no real benefit of 'nostalgia goggles' going on here.  Two aspects really carry Morrowind - the art style and lore.   Morrowind's art style is beyond fantastic - this game, even in its vanilla state, has some of the most interesting locales in any RPG to date, and despite technological restraints managed to bring the raw original brilliance of the artwork behind it to fruition. Dozens of hours into the game I was still getting surprised by fascinating structures and brilliant armour designs (moving past the giant pauldrons of the era). It's impossibly not to appreciate the locales in a genre dominated by generic and uninteresting art directions (they addressed this in the sequels).  Every bit of lore from this game is some of the most engaging I've read - and from its recognizable roots as another Tolkien-esque fantasy scape, has managed to conjure something not only fantastic on its own merit, but some of the best backstory that exists to date. From stories of politics to gods to simple farmers in over their heads, Vvardenfell leave you actively involved in its world on every level, even if initiating reading passages from the UI is a bit of a chore.  The UI itself is reminiscent of System Shock 2's responsive and novel system, Morrowind's one-button activated menu system makes shifting through the various systems outright fun. Small touches, like letting you have a rather hefty amount of customization on your own menu layout, make what would otherwise be a chore into it's own miniature slice of fun. The air of the game wanting you to customize it to your heart's content permeates it - from the famous amount of armour slots to the massive skill system, all of it which has survived the passing of time intact.  One of the big debates when discussing any earlier game is whether or not it 'aged well'. I'm of the opinion that good games don't age well - either they were always good, or we were simply making do. On that note, it's hard to argue that we weren't just 'making do' with the attempts at naturalism in Morrowind. Walking animations and most of the animations are jank and laughable, vast landscapes cartoonish and graphics that were cutting edge for the time look rusty to say the least.  But as a game? Far from making do, Morrowind was just never particularly good.   Combat is braindead. Any combination of stealth, brute force or guile-driven magics - while all expansive systems in themselves - is a mouse-clicking mind-numbing stat-check fest that never grows in complexity or demand, and reaches the maximum amount of brainpower needed 5 minutes into the game. It's a turn-based game that masquerades as a realtime game, with none of the strategic elements and spacing that turn-based and tabletop games naturally have.   Add to that the sheer amount of vapid filler content in this game and you've got a recipe for a game that squanders its excellent foundations. For every decent Main Quest or DLC slice of content, there's twenty times that amount in repetitive commute, escort/fetch quests, and three-room dungeons littered across the landscape. It reduces this fantastic looking game into committing the greatest sin a game can: it gets boring.   From beginning to end you'll be doing the same thing, doing the same dressed up quests, and the broken Fortify Attribute systems or decent DLC/Main Quest content don't save it in a world where Ultima exists, doing the same things but not relying on quantity over quality.  On top of this, the fantastic lore just leaves you wanting more. That you never see silt-striders crossing the swamps, or the cult-hags conspiring for the sake of conspiring, or any of the lively world painted by the ingame lore just leaves the world feeling incredibly static, lifeless, restrictive, and honestly disappointing. A picture paints a thousand words, but Morrowind came jam-packed with a novel's worth of imaginative writing.  Now most of these concerns can actually be modded out. The graphics replaced (though not always with the original concept art in mind, sadly), the combat more demanding, the dungeons more fun - but here's the kicker, the Steam version is completely unmoddable without practically divorcing it from Steam.  The GOTY Steam version doesn't even offer resolutions beyond 4:3, even though they took the time to update the logo! I can see myself returning to this game. But not in its current state, not without even being able to address the caveats it has without breaking the one reason to buy it on Steam to begin with.  There's no reason to buy this version of Morrowind. What's here worth experiencing isn't worth experiencing here - move on, and acquire it by other means if you really intend to see what people are raving about.",

Hell yes, without a doubt in my mind I would tell someone to buy this, on sale that is. But, do I enjoy the game itself? No, mainly due to how outdated it is, not speaking graphics-wise graphics aren't the issue, I am talking about how the game functions because of how I am not used to any of it really.

The game has aged to the point of borderline unplayability. And it's not even THAT old... even Unreal Tournament 1999 had better graphics.   The combat is a joke. I could understand a dice-roll system in a game like Knights of the Old Republic, but in this game it is just unnecessary.   AND the enemies on which you use this god-awful combat system are themselves god-awful. They range from tiny slugs to pterodactyl things.   The UI is the icing on the cake... It makes playing this game feel like trying to paint a mural while on stilts AND rollerskates on a skateboard.   On the plus side, it does give you nearly absolute freedom to do whatever the heck you want, and the main quest is more of a suggested starting point, which I appreciate. But there's a difference between excessive hand-holding (Skyrim) and ACTUALLY GETTING INSTRUCTIONS! They will literally give you quest pointers like 'Go 40 paces north, look approximately 12 degrees to your left, and you should see a clump of seaweed. That's your cue to go into the cave located somewhere within a 3-mile radius of the seaweed, and find the Dwarven Ruin within.' Does your character think far enough ahead to write this down? NO! 'I'll remember it' Pretentious people on the Internet often rail at some games for 'not being intelligent' and they praise Half-Life 2 as the pinnacle of intelligent games, when it is essentially just a long hallway. Those people will try to pitch this game as 'intelligent, unlike today's games' but pitching poor design as an integral and innovative gameplay element is... well... 'it's got heart!'  Unless you played this game 13 years ago and are planning to get it on Steam... please keep in mind everything mentioned above. If poorly-refined gameplay is your cup of tea, by all means, get this game. If not, get Oblivion instead, which is 100x better. (not to mention, actually playable)",

And I'm not talking about resolution or polygon count or anything. Low graphics and bad graphics are not neccesarially the same thing, but Morrowind has both. Half the textures are just various shades of brown, and the animations are just absolutely horrible. Everyone  walks   waddles  around like they have something shoved up their ♥♥♥, and somone decided to make the Khajiit look like they're tiptoeing with clown shoes!  The controls and menus are incredibly unintuitive (right click to open inventory?!) and more time is spent figuring out how to use them than actually using them. Also, you use lockpicks BY STABBING THE LOCK LIKE A KNIFE.  You start off just being thrown right into the game, with no real idea of what to do. I understand that at times Oblivion and Skrim sort of hold your hand and oversimplify things, but it's better than Morrowind's policy of GIVING YOU ABSOLUTELY NO HELP WHATSOEVER. To make things worse, you start off in the middle of nowhere with a very long hike to get to any of the game's cities. I understand the appeal of exploration, but going on an adventure and just finding new things is one thing, and spending five hours walking down the brownest road ever created while trying to figure out where the ♥♥♥♥ to go is something else entirely.  The game does not teach you ♥♥♥♥ about combat other than giving you a knife and having you swing it once. If you're lucky, you'll be able to figure out what to do before a mudcrab manages to eat your  other  leg off. But if you get hurt, don't worry! Just rest for a few in-game hours and you'll be randomly attacked by an assassin with much better equipment than you and a belief that your face is an excellent place to store daggers!  And finally, there's the Dark Brotherhood quests. Or to be more precise, the lack of them. You can only join the Morag Tong.

After about six or more hours into the game, I became increasingly frustrated with it's fully RNG based system, from determining NPC interactions, Combat, even things like being found, and killed by goblins while invisibile AND sneaking.  It doesn't just stop there though. I look at the generation Morrowind came out in, and the fact it was the first TES game to bridge both PC and the classic Xbox, and by comparison to other games of the same and other genres, it's graphics quality are just beyond ♥♥♥♥. I'm sorry, but in the generation this game came out in, I expected so much more from it.  Then there's the annoying, if there is even ONE live enemy within five game scale miles*exaderated* of you, forget about resting, to heal up.  The list does go on and on, but I digress. This is a graphically, and mechaniclaly flawed game.

I cannot imagine wanting to do more such fights with lots of dull mouse-clicking and key-pressing just to make my hero do something. Else he would stand like frozen and be torn into pieces. He would not even try to defend himself automatically, such as to raise a shield in defense. So I give different moves a try, retreating as evasive maneuver, moving forward as a thrusting attack, moving sideways and clicking to swing the weapon. It sounds entertaining at first, but there is no feedback at all on whether this will help my hero in any way. I guess it doesn't. It only affects the type of damage when hitting the target. But I don't even know the enemy's resistances, if any. Everything I do during combat, I don't know whether it will be good practice. Same for the enemies. I don't learn how they attack me except or any animation. If my hero gets paralyzed temporarily, no feedback at all about how long it will take before mouse-clicks or keyboard will work again for an own attack.  The 3D world may be large and filled with many quests. This opens opportunities. Observing somebody at night from the top of a lighthouse tower, nice idea. Beyond that, at the start of the game in the first city and the second largest city of the world, I feel alone, and there is way too much to read about the world, the cities, the various fractions, plus the many items. Various people, such as commoners, have not much else to say than to tell the same or another bit about the world. In a user-interface that makes it tedious to look up all their answers. I find books inside the game, which may or may not be relevant. I start as an outsider with a first duty. I try two ways to reach the target city. The fast one, and the tiresome one by walking or running slowly a looooong way. Somewhere near a lake, I rest outside. An assassin attacks me. I kill him, but due to the chaotic nature of the action-centric combat, I cannot tell whether it has been helpful to summon a skeleton. Too late or early enough? No idea. If not my hero, did I gain any experience at least? I dunno. Perhaps it's necessary to spend hundreds of hours reading Wiki pages and to retry the same encounter several times.
