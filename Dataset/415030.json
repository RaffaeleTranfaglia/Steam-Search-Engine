            "review_text": "Simply one of the best roguelikes I've ever played. If someone asks me what 'roguelike' means I just have to show them this game. It has everything you need in a good roguelike:  - Easy mechanics - Every run is different - Challenging difficulty - Huge variety of loot - Great level design - Secret rooms - Amazing soundtrack - Beating a level is very rewarding - And many more features that suit this game perfectly  In my opinion this game deserves to be played a lot more. Also frequent updates make the game even more interesting. One of the things that bothered me in the beginning though was the fact that you can't turn your view up or down. You can only turn your view to the left and to the right but after an hour of playing this will become completely normal.  All in all One More Dungeon is a great game and has lots of potential of becoming one of the best roguelikes out there. If you've played Delver, Eldritch or even DOOM you will instantly fall in love with this game!",

            "review_text": "On one hand, I really don’t want to bash someone’s lone coding attempts because it’s great when you design something from the ground up and after putting in work, you have a product you can actually feel proud about that you can sell to people; mad respect. However, on the other hand, One More Dungeon would be worth recommending if:     There was more to gameplay strategy outside of +back against melee foes and alternate strafing and left click against ranged foes     All of the “cool” weapons shown in the gameplay footage weren't shoved into the end of the game or a really really lucky chest opening      Levels were more open. I get that it’s supposed to be akin to a dungeon crawler but I’m not exactly asking for Lichdom Battlemage-tier empty expanses, just a bit more room for actual strategy and/or movement     It didn’t feel like I was burning money every time I used a wand; it was REALLY easy to get screwed because there were magic crystals for all of the wands except the one you’re actually using      There weren’t any enemies that seriously obstructed your vision. Vision obstruction in a first person game is actually the worst design choice imaginable if the game is going to be about fun  And most importantly if:    When I did eventually die, I actually felt like playing one more life. BoI and FTL always have me coming back for another round, but dying in OMD just made me question if I wanted to even keep it installed on my system.   The currently top-rated review is 100% right: OMD is monotonous. I don't feel too bad about sinking $5 into it and it's always great to see someone actually think about Linux when it comes to supported OSes, but even though Delver might be in Early Access Hell, they've still got a better formula going on than OMD. If you've got $5 to spend and want to give it a shot regardless of reviews, go nuts, but I'd say if you want to spend $5 just put it in your Steam Wallet or something.",

            "review_text": "Is it a bad game? No. Is it a great game? No.  This game tries to simulate the look and feel of early first person shooters. Unfortunately, although I like the look, I dislike the general gameplay.  - Most enemies are silent or near-silent. In Wolfenstein 3D, you could hear the enemies shouting, so you knew you had to do something to avoid damage. In One More Dungeon, you start taking damage, then you try looking around to find where the enemy is. By the time you locate it, you lost at least a quarter of your total life.  - The weapons have a delay. In Wolfenstein 3D, and in most shooters, the attack is instantaneous. It doesn't matter if that's realistic or not, that's fun to play. In One More Dungeon, there is a long delay between clicking the mouse button and attacking. And this delay increases on certain weapons. This makes the gameplay boring, and also makes it more likely to get hurt before being able to hit the enemy.  - Melee combat is basic and annoying. Truth to be told, melee combat in most first-person games is awful. This game follows this trend.  - Although I like the pixelated look, I dislike how it affects the gameplay. There is so much decoration everywhere that it is hard to see enemies, which sometimes are behind the decoration. The wall graphics are also too busy, making it even harder to see the enemies against them.  - The randomly generated levels don't make any sense and feel… random! Wolfenstein 3D had hand-crafted levels that made logical sense, and that had unique visuals and decorations so that we could orient ourselves even without a map. In this game, however, the map is pretty much required.  - Poorly designed random items. I've had a run where I found 2 chests and no keys (until I died, of course). I found 2 or 3 daggers (in addition to the dagger we start with), and 3 staves of the same kind that I already had. All of those were useless drops. And I ran out of crystals because I had 'bad luck' and only found crystals of the other kinds. For comparison, Crypt of the NecroDancer also has random levels, but it always spawns a certain number of diamonds per level, and always spawns a key whenever a locked chest shows up.  - Lack of Steam Cloud. This game has some progression to buy/unlock mutators. However, there is no Steam Cloud support.  Overall, it is not a 'bad' game, but it is poorly designed. Try playing these games instead: Wolfenstein 3D, Eldritch, Rise Of The Triad (the original one), Rogue Legacy, Crypt of the NecroDancer.",

            "review_text": "This game is pretty well done; it doesn't have a storyline, but it does underestimate one's eye.   You're playing as a nameless explorer with armed only with a staff and sword, who is in a dungeon crawling with monsters and treasure... sounds pretty familiar, right?   You explore dungeons exploring into more and more hard dungeons, filled with better loot and weirder monsters. You can buy artifacts with special buffs, or just better magic staffs and swords/axes/lances/daggers with coins you sometimes find around dungeons. I've never gotten to the final dungeon (I think there are 10 or 8, not sure), but you can definately finish the game (it's not never-ending dungeons). There are also your occaisonal traps with annoyances of bats, rats and plants.  Potions! You have potions that you drink, and there is one useless potion, which you drink and poisions you (it sucks.). Theres also a variety of gamemodes you can play in, and you unlock them every playthrough (where you score by killing enemies and whatnot); for example, broken cartridge, where your view has different colors (yes, this is an actual gamemode).  With pixel graphics, you can only left or right; there is no need to look up or down anyways because the ceilings are low. Enemies can be particularly annoying, but you can usually take on mutiple enemies at the same time with your staff and sword.  Repetitive? Yes. High replay value? Absolutely. Enemies? Fairly annoying! I'd give this game a respectable 7.9/10. It definately has high replay value (because duh, you want to go in ONE MORE DUNGEON!).",

            "review_text": "Better than Delver? I think not. People compairing this to DOOM? Uh... no. This is more like Wolfenstein 3d. Very primitive 'boxy' level design, unlike DOOM's organic, unique, and non-symetric design. The sound effects are weak in this game. The gameplay is shallow and repeatitive. Level design is way too primative. Meh. Pass. Play Delver instead. Even though Delver is 'Early Access', it is a much better and polished game than this. Plus, level design in Delver is much better and more rememberable.",

            "review_text": "Not even close to being on par with Delver, Barony, or Eldtritch. I see no reason why I would play this game over any of those 3 games. No system that can play this won't be able to play at the very least Delver, and Delver is a VASTLY superior game (and probably the best of the bunch it's just the lowest as far as minimum reqs go).  I picked this game up as a part of a bundle of games, Killer Bundle 8 on Bundlestars and I am farming the trading cards and finishing up a run on Delver instead. Anyone who has anything negative to say about Delver, play this and maybe you will realize that you've taken Delver for granted. The movement in this game is like playing an old 2.5D FPS but with a bunch of added clutter and too much crap on the screen. I would say it could use a graphics overhaul (like Delver had early on in development) in favor of something more simplified, where as Delver went in the opposite direction and added much more detail and a much more unique art style. However it would really need a whole new game engine. The RPG qualities and the design of the mobs and the levels, such as markings on walls and objects on the floor, really do not lend themselves to this 2.5D game. It all just comes off as something that gives you the feeling that there is always something blocking your view, and that is even after fiddling with the depth of field setting which admittedly they were nice enough to include.  This game was on my wishlist and was also on sale during the Summer Sale of 2016 for 1.49 USD. It was not worth that price I found out after giving it a chance. I own it only because it was part of a bundle that I was already buying. And the only reason I'm taking the time to type all this out is so that hopefully someone who wants a FPSRL ((First Person Shooter Rogue-Like) or if you prefer, FPRL) will read this and steer clear of it.  The best FPSRL's are 1 = Delver 2 = Eldritch 3 = Barony 4-10 = Reserved 11 Rogue Shooter 12-999 = Reserved for the next nine hundred somethin' games of this genre that are released 1000 = What it looks like when you huff enough paint and/or computer duster 1001 = One More Dungeon  Please do yourself a favor and get one of those others instead.",
