    "description": "Battlevoid: Harbinger is a hard sci-fi space exploration game blending roguelike, turn-based, star map strategy, and real-time space battles. You are a young commander venturing out into enemy territories, to unknown galaxies, never knowing what you will face as you jump out from hyperspace.",

The way weapons and equipment mounting and firing somewhat work the same, except you can 'craft' it if you got the resources instead of having to salvage or purchase at a shop. Everytime you jump the system map updates. Enemy fleets move around, events happen, and you gotta react to it. You can repair for free at stations or spend scrap to repair out in the field. Just imagine Convoy and FTL but with resources you can do pretty much everything, no need to 'get lucky'.",

            "review_text": "An interesting cross between FTL and SPAZ. The game is slower even in the real time battles giving you time to make a more strategic choice of placement rather than twitch ability. There is a decent variety of turrets for ships, all of which can be upgraded in a variety of stats throughout the game, including some support-only turrets. You gain experience throughout the game, whether you win or lose the scenario, which in turn potentially unlocks new starting ships. There are three main difficulties, but I have yet to actually beat easy, though I have seen the final sector. It is roguelike in the sense that if your ship is destroyed the game ends regardless of how much of your fleet remains. Really nice for essentially being an upgraded port of a mobile game.  Also, you get carriers. I love having a carrier with drones.  UPDATE: I've played enough to beat normal a couple of times and even finished hard once. I have unlocked all but four ships. Still quite enjoyable if you prefer a slower paced game and the ship combinations give it a decent amount of replayability if you don't just want to min/max.",

            "review_text": "It's a less complex version of FTL, where you don't manage your crew, but you manage multiple ships. No fuel restrictions, free repairs at stations (which also defend you when enemies are in the sector), and LOTS of ships to choose from.  The only thing I'd say bogs this game's experience down is that it takes too much gameplay to unlock ships. You get experience when you end a game (so, when you die, since finishing a mission takes you to a new one), but it's never more than like one level.  I'd say $10 is a bit of a high price for this game, but that depends on how badly you want a space game with lots of (fairly repetitive and grindy) gameplay. For most, I'd recommend getting it on sale.",

Really, this deserves a 'meh' at worst but since steam doesn't have that button and $10 is way way too overpriced for this I have to not recommend it.  The game lacks meaningful choices in combat, weapons are too short ranged, maps too small, and ships too slow for you to do much more then cross your fingers when chosing your jump in point and maybe hope to slip a right ship into a right place. Too much of the game is too random (and this is coming from a guy that like Tharsis and FTL) and too many parts of the game are unclear.  There is some fun to be had here, there are some halfway decent choices to be had out of combat and at the end of the day I think I've gotten my money's worth as a halfway decent background distraction while listening to podcasts and the like but I just can't bring myself to recommend it as a blind buy for everyone. Watch a lets play or two of it first, make sure you know how limited your starting options are, and then decide.",

Bigger ships couldn't afford to be outfitted, but again, enemies scale so death in the third or fourth fight by an overwhelming loss.",

            "review_text": "It's a very decent core game, but it requires expanding a bit to truly fulfill its potential.  FTL is the obvious influence, with the following key differences: - The explore &amp; fight aspect is wider in this game, where you can roam around, fight things and upgrade your ship as you see fit. Your end score will just be penalized a bit for how many turns you spend out there, but nothing major. The game doesn't try to push you to the exit. - Thus, this is kind of a space fighting game. It's where the most work went and probably most of what you will do as it's the most interesting aspect and the one which pays off best - The goal aspect/win conditions aspect is more varied in this game, where different games will give you a differend end goal - The crew management is absent in this game, which hurts its depth of play quite unfortunately - The customization aspect is somewhat superior in this game as you can run a squadron of ships, equipping and upgrading each, piloting each individually RTS style - The hardcore aspect manifests slightly differently in this, where one small wrong choice can lead to a disastrous outcome whereas FTL is mostly just 'very hard'. This leads to a more dramatic experience in Battlevoid than in FTL in my opinion - This one allows you to restart the game exactly where you left it, so there's a bit more of that laid back 'let's explore' component  The game would be really good with a bit more depth to its world and mechanics and the inclusion of crew management and more frequent dilemmas. Void of that, after the discovery phase and a handful of sessions of play, it's still a sweet time-eater into which you can throw 10 to 30 minutes here and there and not feel bored or madly frustrated. So don't expect the moon from this game and all will be fine.",

It took me couple of hours to get the hang of it, it is not too complicated. Im glad that there is no playin with fuel, oxygen or power for that matter. little bugs here and there but they are fixing them right now. Repairing isnt too expensive but if u roam around enough u can waste ur scrap metal. VERY FUN GAME....Lost my sleep for the first night and had to go to work as a zombie... yeah it will do that to u if not careful. Very good space strategy. Need to try it on medium or hard but it has been challenging enough with easy settings for 10 hours. only thing that bugs me is that i dont feel theres enough strategy moving your ships in battle. but all in all cant really complain......for now",

The different ship classes are a nice bonus. The costs of wingman ships are just right - you'll try to avoid losing any ships you own, but recovering from loss of your wingmen is not impossible.",

The tutorial will show you the absolute basics but orienting yourself in the game's other controls, themes, and mechanics are a matter of determination. Still... for only a few dollars it's well worth it to any fan of sci-fi fleet combat.  A few notes for the beginner: - For starting weapons focus on range, shield damage, and hull damage. For starting upgrades focus on # of fighters and/or # of projectiles (burst)... though the Laser Cannon is an all-round excellent weapon. - Picking up items is done in Engineering: Drag from Space to Cargo. - Upgrade points (green) should be used to spec your ships for specific roles. - Fill your ship's equipment hardpoints and then save up for the next ship... but make sure to have spare change for some equipment on that ship as well.",

If I miss the tiny target area to click now my ships are moving when I didnt want them to -way to select all fighters, all bombers,  -another icon for laser drones, to differentiate from bolter drones -auto pause on loss of focus option -multiple missions per board, that way you have options and can reject some  -way to reject all missions, not just some -more mission types  Edit:  -as mentioned by other reviews make ships faster on the PC version. there are way more pixels to move through. or at least more FF options -balance ships so smaller ones (starter ships) are at least faster",

The main issues from the game stem from its limitations on the player, I'm assuming being brought over from the IPad itteration. Though the game has a variety of guns... that's really all it has. Also, some guns, such as rocket cannons, are far more versatile and powerful than others. There are no other tactical advantages to utilize. All ships move the speed of refrigerated gravy, and there is no way to increase said speed, or bolster the starting hulls to create true assault ships or fast flanking craft. Your fleet is also limited to three ships, the other two of which are drawn from a limited list of support vessels. People keep saying this game is hard, but after you unlock the destroyer, learn the guns and thier functions, and realize that carriers are OP with their bombers and fighter craft, an experienced tactical mind will win this game in about their fifth or sixth playthrough.  Reccomended for a quick Rougelike space shooter if you don't have a lot of time to kill, but don't expect Sins of a Solar Empire, or Battlefleet Gothic, level of combat.",

            "review_text": "Recommended with some reservations. First, obviously I enjoy this game. I've played quite a few hours, and I've gotten my money's worth...  That said, there's a lot of room for improvement. The balance is way off, for starters. You'll occasionally be so completely outclassed in the early to mid game that it's almost silly. This is even more true at Normal difficulty, which feels crazy difficult. I haven't bothered with 'hard' yet. Then, in the late game, you'll find yourself so absurdly overpowered that the enemies don't even have a chance.  The environmental hazards are either boring or annoying, but never really interesting.   The ship types aren't diverse enough, There's really no difference to the way the different ships play, aside from starting with hangars and fighters or not. And once you've bought your first formation ship, you'll have covered all your bases.  The story is barely, barely there, and while it suggests some interesting ideas, it's basically just a few totally ignorable text boxes at the beginning and end of each map.   The enemies, also, really aren't all that different. Knowing the difference in what weapons they favor is only relevant for the first map, and by then you have the start of a fleet and it doesn't matter at all what weapons your enemies use.  There is zero element of choice anywhere in this game. The quests are meaninglessly generic.   Also, why can't I just right-click on enemies to call up the selector wheel that lets me target them with all my ships? Why do I have to click on my ship, then on the enemies?   I feel like the creators came up with an engaging and easy to use set of basic systems. Then they built half a game around those systems. I think this game has a lot of promise, and I'm still enjoying it, but my interest is definitely going to wane way faster than with some of the other games in this genre. I really hope we get to see a sequel that keeps what works about this game and builds a richer world and experience on top of it.",
