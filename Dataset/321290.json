            "review_text": "Well, first off, I have to say this is an absolutely beautiful game. If you’re looking for a subpar dating sim, you will have to look elsewhere, because Dandelion is very well put-together and a blast to play. The graphics are very nice and the characters are interesting and adorable in different ways. The stories for the different boys are very cool to learn about over time and the mysterious voice from somewhere is, uh, very mysterious. Very  I-don’t-explain-anything-but-I-imply-that-there-is-a-huge-background-here-wink-wink-to-those-who-have-played-the-game-enough . So yeah, very mysterious to me. One of the only issues that I had with it was the typos that popped up sometimes, but overall the translation was well done. They did a very good job of maintaining the sweet, giving nature of Heejung while also revealing her struggles and discontent. She can almost seem too placid, but it is understandable, given her past, and as the game moves forward, she does show signs of a backbone as she comes in to her own (thanks, furry adorableness?), which I whole-heartedly approve of.  It takes some time to recognize the voices and names (very creative, Heejung…lots of J’s @_@) but once you do, it becomes very easy to know who is speaking during scenes that don’t show faces. The different colors help and the personalities are so unique from one another that it becomes clear pretty quickly. The stat system is very intensive if you want to buff them all out, but the options are cute and for some of the boys, it’s important to max out your stats as quickly as possible. Just think of it as primping and sketching your way to the top. I actually do enjoy the grind, because the little illustrations are cute and it’s nice to become beautiful just by taking a bath. Unfortunately there have been no side effects in real life.  The most important thing that you should keep in mind when playing this game is FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS FURRY AND CUTE DO  NOT  TRY TO GAIN HEARTS FROM ALL OF THEM. You may think, ‘Oh that’d be nice to be friends with all of them! I’ll just hang out with everyone and become a more well-rounded person!’ That is the quickest path to a bad ending, except in a few special cases, which I'm sure you'll figure out after a couple of hours of playing.   Yes.   I was there.   Let me lay out the scene for you: There I was on a different guy’s route, when I thought I would go out on the weekend and have a nice, friendly lunch with Jiwoo, you know? Just two buds hanging out and becoming even better friends. Maybe he’d even stop calling me stupid one day! During lunch, he says something about me feeding him, and being the desperate-for-points-and-new-interactions player I am, I chose the ‘Open wiiiide” option, thinking it was a little weird, but hey, I don’t judge friendships. Then he goes and says something about not dating any other boys. And if I were really Heejung, I would have stopped in my tracks and wondered, ‘You think we’re dating?!?!’ But of course, I am not her, and the game just continued on, unmindful to the fact that it had just rocked my world. When I started the game, I thought that Heejung was very oblivious when it came to boys, which was cute but almost a little much. Now, I know the horrid truth. I am JUST as  oblivious  and  stupid  about boys as a main protagonist of a DATING simulator. TT_TT  Let’s just say there is one bad ending in particular which is more than a little traumatizing and I couldn’t stop thinking about it last night. On the bright side, they did an excellent job of unobtrusively sliding you into an abusive and very dangerous relationship, with you torn between thinking there is something very wrong, and thinking that it will turn out okay once he calms down.   He didn’t calm down.   I am still a bit emotionally scarred and I have been hesitant to play his good route (I just need some recovery time…). I recommend you get all the good endings before you try to get the bad endings for completeness—that way you’ll still be able to sleep at night without thinking someone’s going to be hovering over your bed. Following you to the bathroom…not letting you talk to people…scarring the actual player for real…or maybe that’s just me. But, what the heck, do whatever you like!  (It’s your funeral)   On a completely random side note, I like to pretend that the silver-haired man in the city panoramic scene that pops up once in a while is actually the main protagonist from Persona 4 (just to spice up the scenery for me). Unfortunately, no matter how many times I click on him, he does not become a dateable furball of cuteness. But I can just imagine him as a large darker gray-haired rabbit, majestically lording over everyone in King’s Game. X3 He’d fit right in with Jieun and Jihae!",

I found his personality unique, and he’s the kind of “to hate or to love” character. Possibly one of the best male characters I’ve seen on a otome game so far. I really wish that Cheritz would make a sequel.   The status raising can be annoying sometimes tho. But after a while you’ll get used to it.  10/10, worth all the tears.",

She was much too weak of a character for me—though I acknowledge others may like her.  I finished four of the five routes (mostly on an old steam account...long story), and felt sort of “meh” about them overall. I know everyone’s got their opinions on whose story/personality/ending was better (and I do, too), but I felt like all of them were pretty superficial and left a fair amount unexplained and unresolved. The daily stats building was tedious, especially after the first playthrough. And some of the typos/mistakes were distracting. I can handle typo or translation issues here or there—but there were mix ups with the characters names.  I won’t even comment on the aspects of the stories that I found problematic (because I’m sure some of this is cultural and/or personal). I will, however, say that I typically can overlook some of these things and still have an enjoyable game experience. I wanted to like this game. I tried. But, in the end, the stories and characters (which is what I play for), just aren’t worth it—especially not with a $20+ pricetag.",

I'm not one to spend money on games I know nothing about, based on a whim.  50+ hours and many sleepless nights later, I regret nothing. Every ending, every CG, every bit of bonus; I've done anything and everything Dandelion has to offer. Including Heejae...  The best of the story-lines ironically happens to be the most PG. Jieun owns my heart, at least the most. Each of them have a piece of it because, despite my fears that one story or another might be lackluster, they were all engrossing, heartfelt, and hooked me - hook line and sinker, so to speak. As the Wizard said, no one ordinary would do. Each story will touch you; if not, then you just have no heart, do you? *sniff*  The art is beautiful, the story - all said and done - is touching. While the repeatitive stat grinding got on my nerves by the time I was on my third playthrough, it wasn't enough to pull me out of wanting to play. If focused, you can get through one story in roughly 4-6 hours. The music was nice, too. Enough bonus things to be amused and, again, make it feel like it was worth the full price that I paid.   Also... I felt for the Wizard in the end. That extra bit was a nice touch.   10/10, would unwittingly be a pawn in the Wizard's game any time",

Also, the Yandere cat is likely to be triggering for some people, especially if you stumble on to his bad end, and he even when he's being 'good' he can sometimes say some homophobic or abusive things. The other cat can also be a bit abusive, although he's better than Yandere cat overall.  The Bunnies are all pretty cool tho, especially the non-Tsunderes.",

This is my first otome and apparantly this is a thing that's enjoyed? Not for me. I wish the demo were attached to be able to try that out first, or I should have just watched walkthroughs instead.  $10 would have been alright for this game, but $30 felt like a waste. I'm a bit 'meh' about this. Would be nice if the game creators added more story, and more content. Maybe an update for more characters or a FULL ENDING for each of the stories?",

            "review_text": "Dandelion is an Outrageous game!  Outrageously and hysterically funny and surprisingly deep once you get into it!  You play as a senior student, Heejung Kim who has moved to Busan from her perfectionistic and nagging Mother. She hopes to find her own path in life in this new town and is a great student, but not knowing what she truly wants from life and not having much self-esteem from her past, she keeps stressing about being the perfect girl and being pushed down from pressure of korean society and the insane ideals of her Mother.  So much that she has frequent flasbacks and nightmares, this being her trauma.   One fateful morning the meowing of a cat wakes her up. Heejung lives alone, but now a basket of 5 animals is lying next to her bed! How did that happen?  Who are these animals who occasionally seem to talk between themselves?  Why do the animals you've taken care of as pets instead of sending to a shelter despite your stressful life suddenly transform to handsome men later on, but can't explain anything about this insanity?   In order to find out, and in order to progress the story enough to reveal their humanforms and further, you as the player need to take action! You start out with 5 adoreable pets(2 Cats and 3 Rabbits). Even though they change from pets to a bunch of dudes(with animal ears), Heejung decides to let them stay on the condition that they wear hats or hoodies to hide their ears when necessary. Build up relationship points by interacting with them in your apartment, and occasionally by bringing them out for walks/dates. How you respond to events also affects your relationships, and the status of Heejung herself ofcourse.  Your adoreable pets are as follows;  *Jihae - The Silver Rabbit The beautiful, princely and mature one of the bunch, Heejung and Jihae seem to share an interest in art. He takes much care and responsibilty over Jihae and is stunning enough to be a model.  *Jieun - The Pure White Rabbit The (shouta)youngest of the bunch, a quiet, gentle and closest to (Eddie..)Jihae. He loves apples to the point of being addicted and doesn't talk much at first, being very thoughtful.  *Jiwoo - The Spotted(Cow) Rabbit From the start he isn't the most social one of the bunch, nor the politest one. He is however perhaps the most intellectual one! Stuck-up and rude, but smart rabbit. Can you say Tsundere!  *Jisoo - The Black Cat The badboy if you will. He seems rough at first, but clearly has a soft spot for food! He also likes to tease Heejung, but doesn't mean any harm. Just being a playful cat afterall...  *Jiyeon - The Orange Cat The adoreable sweetheart of the bunch, rarely seen without a big smile on his face. He seems very pure and childish at first and even makes several small language mistakes. A charming heartbreaker!  Try not to let stress or pressure take over completly, or you might end up collapsing like a squished pudding with Heejae, your classmate. He seems sweet and is certainly caring for you, but is sadly your BAD ENDING! So focus that doki doki on your pets! (wow, that sounds slightly wrong..)  You'll quickly learn how quick save/load is your best friend through gameplay while balancing stress, pressure and raising ceratin stats for certain characters. Whenever you need to check your staus, wallet, items(some can raise stats) and relationship progress, just right click and well.. click status on the menu!  Once you progress through the story it's easy to fall inlove with the personalities of the characters, the CG artwork is neat and sets the mood, and learning their stories I find myself wanting to play more and more and get to know each character. My personal favourite so far is without a doubt Jihae, but that might quickly change within the other routes as I've been focusing on this rare silver rabbitman's route.  I enjoy seeing how the story progresses in a steady pace of growing feelings from being awkward at first to eventually blooming a romance to adoreable CG artwork. As for music, my opinion is mixed. Some of the looping music became quite annoying which made me hope for more variation(to my relief that the next season change had another loop), but some of the bgm was very enjoyable. I think music-wise it is more of a preference thing. However, the User Interface was absolutely to my taste! Well organized, easy and very practical to the game (quick save/load, how I love it!)  All in all I'd say Dandelion is absolutely a game worth playing if you enjoy rich stories with colourful characters, and the fate of the protagonist lying in your hands! Enjoy your harem &lt;3",

            "review_text": "**This review of Dandelion - Wishes brought to you - may contain minor spoilers.**  Dandelion - Wishes brought to you - is the debute otome game for the Korean video game studio, Cheritz. The game was released in South Korea in August 2012 and was released in the US in August 2012. The game was released on Steam on September 29, 2014.  The game revolves around Heejung, a Korean college student majoring in business with a penchant for art. One day, she wakes up to discover a basket of animals in her room: two cats and three rabbits. Heejung eventually adopts the animals as her own, only to discover that the would-be animals actually have human forms. Moreover, they're actually from another world entirely.   DISCLAIMER: While I have beaten the good routes for all of the characters, I have not yet played through the bad routes. I'm sure I'll play through them eventually, and will amend my review accordingly if needed.   The protagonist:  Heejung Kim, our leading lady, is an incredibly relatable character. Ever since her parents divorced, she has struggled to meet her mother's expectations. In doing so, Heejung has lost her sense of self. What does she want to do with her life? What kind of person does she want to be? As the game progresses, Heejung finds those answers.  While the game does not explicitly call the relationship between Heejung and her mother abusive, the characters of Dandelion universally acknowledge that Heejung's mother's behavior is unacceptable. No one ever attempts to encourage Heejung to make amends with her mother; no one ever makes excuses for her mother's behavior (e.g., 'she just wants the best for you!'), either. That definitely won brownie points with me.  While Heejung's characterization is fairly consistent across all routes, there are some routes where her growth as a character is absolutely outstanding. If you like lots of character development in your protagonists, I highly recommend that you start with the Jieun route.    The love interests:   Before I bought the game, a friend warned me that the bunny routes were all much better than the cat routes. After clearing through all the good endings, I absolutely agree. The interaction between the bunny characters and Heejung were mostly positive; those relationships -- for the most part -- involved mutual support and care and respect.  Unfortunately, the same can not be said for the cat routes.  While the game did a fabulous job of addressing familial abuse, some of the romantic relationships on the game were abusive. While I don't plan on addressing those issues in every route, there is one love interest where the abuse is especially prevelant; that's the fan favorite, Jisoo's route.  During his route, he does the following:  -follows Heejung without her knowledge -tells Heejung she can't be friends with any other men -assumes that Heejung secretly has a boyfriend when he discovers Heejung crying about her mother and then retaliates by /pining her down/ and demanding to know why she lied to him about her relationship status -repeatedly drags Heejung off by the wrist and holds her down against her will/protests   Unlike the relationship between Heejung and her mother, the game fails to acknowledge that this behavior is abusive; disappointingly, it's even romanticizied.   All of the bunny routes managed to make up for extremely unhealthy relationships that Heejae had with Jisoo and, to a lesser degree, Jiyeon. If you value healthy relationships, you'll enjoy any of the bunny routes. If I had to recommend one, though, it'd definitely be Jihae's route.   Final Thoughts:  Dandelion - Wishes brought to you - is your standard otome game. You play a female protagonist, you fall in love, and Things Happen. While the story itself doesn't bring anything new to the table, it's (most of) the characters, the character development, and the way the game thoughtfully and respectfully address familial abuse that make Dandelion a stand-out title for me. Highly recommended.  Final ranking: 4/5",

            "review_text": "Previously, I have already played the game before it was released into steam and honestly I wouldn’t mind playing this game over and over again. Here’s why:   In terms of art, music, and story, I think this game has done a good job focusing on all these aspects.  The art is consistant, anatomy is fine, colors are bright and CGs are all different yet, suiting. Giving you a reason to collect them all. Character designs are also lovely and suit with their personality and voices nicely, with the animals having 2 types of clothes, the modern one and fantasy one is also a very good call.  The music is nice no matter where you're at, and it doesn't get annoying (IMO the best would be the opening and ending songs of course).  Now the story, were do I being? Originally when I saw the game I was expecting a thick headed happy-go-lucky kind of protagonist, but nope! Heejung (The protagonist) is not only smart, down to earth, and caring; she also carries in herself a short of dark past. The game is constantly giving out new surprises throughout the story, and is excellent at pulling heartstrings. I even found myself going through all the good and bad endings (Something I don't do if the stories/endings are too similar or predictable). I also love how most events also bring in some of the other characters in the game. Certain otome games(dating simulations/visual novels) tend to isolate the main character and the love interest, but in many routes, there's still interaction between them and the rest of the characters.   Now for secrets and bonus content. Other than just the usual 'get cgs throughout the route', the game also includes an amusing minigame that allows you to collect stamps of a certain character and unlock a bonus cg and the concept sketches. Another thing I liked is that the actual ending is after the beautiful credits, and the fact the credits would show all the CGs previously seen for that route, making it worth watching~   The only one thing I didn't like much was that the bonus was 'voice only', meaning to say since I didn't understand korean (in case you didn't know the game is voice and originally was in korean) I didn't understand what they were saying. However, for those that just enjoy hearing the voices of the characters, this is a perfect treat.",

They're not just quickly drawn pretty boys, they have reasons for how they act and why. For men in animal ears, they're pretty realistic in terms of behaviour. (except falling for this clueless MC, ofc) The music is beautiful, art's well made. The GC's are quite breathtaking.  The game takes you along for an emotional ride, and you'll notice yourself getting attached to the characters. Each new playthrough with a new guy felt like a betrayal every time. Until I accepted the fact I just need to touch all of their butts or I won't be happy! The game play gets repetitive quite fast though, with the stat raising and waiting for the days to pass to get to the good parts. For a completionist like me, who needs to get all the bad endings, good endings and extras, after a couple playthroughs it's not that fun anymore. The character dialogue and GC's are deffo worth it though, and skip function for the heavy story parts ftw.  Them speaking Korean caught me off guard first as it was the first time I ever heard the language, but you get used to it! So don't let that be the reason you'll miss out on this game. The voice acting is actually really good once you get used to the new language (although I admit, I still think they'd sound better in japanese) and their voices suit them well!

I like the way you build relationships with many actions, so you don't miss out on the guy you choose by simply saying the wrong thing. The main character is tolerable and cute, compared to how annoying the heroines can be in this genre. Highly recommended to people who want to experience a great romance.",

            "review_text": "Just finished my first playthrough of this game today, and I loved it. It has a well-developed backstory for our protagonist and she's relatable and quite ordinary - in the best way possible. It plunges you into the storyline quickly, so you don't get bored waiting for the game to 'start'. The art is gorgeous. Both animals and humans are insanely adorable visually, and (especially a certain spotted one that captured my heart immediately) insanely adorable emotionally/behaviorally. :&gt; They all have their own personalities and quirks that add to their charm, and if the route I played through is any indication, they likely all have backstories worth learning. I'm certainly satisfied with my choice of romance and experiencing his story. Honestly, I rather fell in love with him and the protagonist as a pair - they had similar heartbreaks in their pasts and seemed a natural fit together, both able to empathize with and support the other. I hope the other routes are as fulfilling (although secretly, in my experience the first romance is always the best, otome game or other, since you gravitate toward the one that speaks to  you , not the protagonist per se). That ending, though... ye olde heartstrings be pulled, aye.  One thing I wasn't aware of when I first started playing was that various scenes have Korean voice acting! Which was an interesting surprise for me, since I'm extremely familiar with Japanese, but extremely unfamiliar with Korean. Had to train myself to pause a second before furthering the dialog in a voiced scene, just in case there was just a pause in the sentence and not a full stop. XD   Word to the wise: save often and don't let the pressure get to you. &gt;:) Have fun! I'm sure you'll love it. &lt;3",

I had played Spirited Heart and was sorely disappointed with the system and how I couldn't romance a guy AND try to aim for the goal that was set out for me. So when I saw that there was a demo to Dandelion I decided to give it a try. Before I knew it the demo was over and I desperatly wanted to know what was next.  That right there was a good sign that I would like the full version of the game. I didn't delay in purchasing it and pursuing Jihae (I did have to check a guide to make sure I was on the right track) and oh man. The feels. He was so sweet, kind, loving, and was a tiny bit jealous. The story line was good, I could relate to the heroine , the art and the music is FANTASTIC. And while raising your stats to try to woo your choice of bachelor you had a good chance in interacting with them if they were in the room. Yes, I had to quick save and quick load to get that to happen sometimes but the fact that I could was awesome.  What I mostly love about this game though was how much I really grew to care about Jihae. I was nearly as heartbroken as the Heroine towards the end of the story line (trying not to spoil the ending). I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys these kind of games. I *do* recommend checking the guide available on steam if you want a decent idea what you should do without any spoilers. Some of these bachelors are *tough* to get. All in all? *Great* game. 10/10!",

Most simulation dating games either focus to much on meaningless stats and tasks or on the story with maybe a few options here and there. Dandelion combines both of these elements well, and even has me engrossed in the story along with its characters (including the MC!). Not only do the men you choose from have personality but so does Heejung, and even though she is her own person I still feel that I am her or she is a version of me if I lived in her shoes. So far I've only played Jiwoo's route, and got the good ending I believe, but I'm more than excited to get every possible combination and unravel this story. The only thing that could have been done better would be more chances to interact with the men and perhaps story options mid cutscene instead of just during gameplay when it only causes minor changes to relationship status.",

Maybe I love cas, bunnies, and animals too much, or maybe I just have a thing for animal ears, but this game is adorable! I personally like Jisoo the most, but that's just one woman's opinion (plus, I still have yet to play the routes of all the characters).  If there were anything to complain about at all, it might be the price, but that being said, there's sales on Steam all the time. Keep any eye on it, and you never know, it might have a nice, fat discount! But well, even if it's only a few dollars off, I'd recommend buying it. With how high quality this game is, I think it's worth the money.  So the bottom line is... awesome game, and I'd totally recommend buying it.",
