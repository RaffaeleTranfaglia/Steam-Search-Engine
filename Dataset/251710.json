    "description": "Chainsaw Warrior from Games Workshop is the classic nail-biting game for one strong-nerved player! It's the year 2032 and spatial warping has opened a hole into another dimension in the midst of the old municipal buildings at the heart of Manhattan. Bizarre and dangerous creatures are flooding into our dimension, intent on destruction.",

            "review_text": " 'Between the time when Snake Plissken escaped New York and the appearance of Predator aliens in central american jungles, there was a game undreamed of. And into this, the Chainsaw Warrior, destined to bear the Laser Lance slung over a cybernetic shoulder. It is I, this reviewer, who alone can tell you of his suicide mission. Let me tell you of the minutes of heroic sacrifice.'   Chainsaw Warrior was an old board game by Games Workshop, created in 1987. This version is a direct adaptation of that game. For this reason, it may appear overly simplistic for many computer gamers.  Beings from another dimension threaten to destroy New York and you, a cybernetically enhanced elite warrior (think 6 Million Dollar man meets Snake Plissken) have 60 minutes to get in the quarantine zone, fight your way through zombies and mutants and reach the big bad 'Darkness' and hope you'll be able to kill it.   'Gentlemen, we can rebuild him. We have the technology. We have the capability to make the world's first bionic man. The Chainsaw Warrior will be that man. Better than he was before. Better... stronger... faster.'   You roll 6-sided dice to create your chainsaw warrior and pick your starting equipment. How many dice you roll depends on which one of the three difficulty levels you choose. While all have the potential for the same stats, on higher difficulties these are more random. Equipment is either chosen freely on Easy or blindly on higher difficulties.   'New York, 2023: The entire city is on the brink of destruction. The old municpal buildings' staircases are mined. The elevators are booby trapped. And an apoclyptic cult has everything locked down. They think.  Based on the board game by Stephen Hand, Auroch Digital's Chainsaw Warrior: One man must go in where no man stands a chance to ever get out. And if he fails his mission, our nightmare has just begun.'   The game comprises of you turning over cards from a deck, each card being one room you search. Once the first 54 card deck is done, you proceed to the second one which includes Darkness. But the clock is ticking: each turn of a card, each round of combat, each other action are 30 seconds and there are 108 cards to turn. So you have to move through the building as fast as possible, conserving ammo and trying not to die of radiation or poison or zombie bites. In the end, when you finally get to Darkness, it may all come down to one stupidly lucky roll of double sixes. But that is what suicide missions with only a remote chance of success are all about.   'So, did the Chainsaw Warrior banish the evil Darkness to its home dimension. And having no further concern, he returned to his hole-in-tjhe-wall appartment. Many cans of beer did the Chainsaw Warrior drink, trying to numb the memories. Yet honor and glory were heaped upon his name and, in time, he was called to save the world once more... And this story shall also be told.' ",

            "review_text": "Did you like Chainsaw Warrior as a card game or do you enjoy simple randomly generated games with little influence from yourselves in a neat setting? If yes then you will enjoy Chainsaw Warrior for what it is. If you were expecting anything more then you won't find it here.  The game involves creating a character via the use of dice and a selection of equipment cards. After that you'll go into the main game which has you clicking through a deck of cards to see what random events you come across, which can be traps, monsters, secret passages etc. At each event you can select between a couple of choices like using a item or attacking. Everything you do is delivered through the dice.  The presentation is okay. The art is mostly from the card game I guess, animations are basic and sound assets aren't anything special, the intro comic is quite neat though. But to me it feels so much more could've been done with this setting, like having the Warrior and Mutants visually on the screen and having them fight it out etc.  I bought the game during a sale for a couple of dollars which to me feels like the right price for this game. The game is ok but I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone except to people who want a digital version of the card game. The game length is also very short, but due to the random nature it can take you between 30 minutes - 3 hours depending on difficulty.",

Graphics and animations are tidy and well put together and the gameplay just keeps attracting you back for more. If you're after a challenge and you like the tabletop dice rolling style of the game play all whilst you're pretending to save New York from a giant rift of the nasties as a badass super cyborg.... then this is for you. Beating the game on easy took me a good few hours... and it reckons the original game was played using the hard setting only.. £4 well spent! :)",

            "review_text": "Only buy the game if you like playing for achievements and it's on sale. Other than that do not buy it.  The game is a card/board game where 85% of the game is decided at the very begining. You start by rolling dice for your stats and gear. Then you start drawing cards at random until you meat the Darkness. The cards can be monsters, events, traps or aid. Your starting stats and gear will determine if you succeed at these events. There are very very limited choices you can make.  There is no graphics to speak of. The card illustrations are average. Average playtime is 15-30 mins.  So if you dont play for achievements it is very unlikely that you will play this game more than twice as it will become boring very quickly.",

            "review_text": "A very well done game I must say.  Story - *SPOILERS* It is centered around the chainsaw warrior *you*, trying to save the world from creatures that came from another universe by a portal. You must slaughter countless zombies, rats, machines and other monsters to get to the final boss and success in defeating him.  Gameplay - You roll with dices to decide what happens, so the game is basically almost all based on luck. First you roll on how well your characters stats are, choose your equipment, and go battle. I must say the battles get somewhat repetitive after a while, though that doesn´t change the awesomeness and randomness of the cards.   Verdict - The game tried to replicate the old card game, and it did well. The game has very suitable graphics, art style and game mechanics for it´s type. The music is quite enjoyable as well. For me, it deserves a solid 8/10. I would recommend it to anyone who likes card games. The minus points for it not being realistic, I mean, my chainsaw ran out of petrol after 2 victims c;. Enjoy!",
