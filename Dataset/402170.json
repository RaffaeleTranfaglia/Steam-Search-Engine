            "review_text": "--OVERVIEW-- I just got this game on release day, and I must, say, it's surprising! Puzzle Ball is, in essence, a spiritual successor to marble-based games like Marble Blast Gold, Ballance and Marble Madness. Being a lover of Marble Blast Gold, I thought that this couldn't hurt and gave it a try. After playing with a few of the scenario levels and checking out the level editor, I must say that this game is amazingly fun for 3 dollars. This game is not as much of a skill platformer as others in its genre, but is more of a puzzle, like the name implies. Figuring out the order in which to accomplish challenges for a high score is important, as some points can be permanently missed if you don't do them at the right times. However, there is never so much chalenge that you will get angry at the game, as the game does live up to its 'casual' tag This, the beautiful graphics, and the relaxing music combine to create a surprisingly fun experience, as watching each levels' mechanisms come to life is fascinating, and there is some satisfaction in completing each level.  --THE EDITOR-- In addition, the level editor is quite easy to use, as the description states. It is a simple 'pick block and place' style editor. However, the camera and controls of the editor are a bit weird, so there is definitely room for improvement there. Other than that, there isn't too much for me to say about the level editor, as I'm not into taht sort of thing.  &gt;NOTE: There is a 'level budget,' so you cannot make infinitely big levels! :(  --MENUS-- This is where my criticisms start. After launching the game, you will be treated to a small graphic informing you of the controls. There seems to be no way to bring this up again besides restarting the game. After dealing with the graphic, you will be treated to a menu with no logo and four buttons: 'Levels,' 'Editor,' 'Options' and 'Quit.' Clicking 'Levels' takes you to a bland screen with the 11 scenario leves shown, with the options to look at user levels. Clicking 'Editor' throws you straight into the editor with no options or preparation screen. Selecting 'Options' brings you to an options screen where you can edit your screen resolution, quality (idk what this exactly means), your languages (choices of English, Russian, and Dutch), something called 'Image Resolution' (I really have no idea what this does), your sound/music volumes, whether to be fullscreen/windowed, bloom, and SSAO. There is no way to rebind key controls, although they are standard (WASD) and you shouldn't have trouble with them. While the menus certainly are functional, they are bland and lack depth; but as this is a 3 dollar game, it is acceptable.  --PROS-- &gt;Interesting gameplay &gt;Very nice graphics &gt;Relaxing music &gt;Infinite replayability with the level editor &gt;Good learning curve  --CONS-- &gt;Only 11 built-in levels &gt;Lame menus &gt;Some typical functionality missing (rebinding controls, advanced graphics, etc.) &gt;Small music selection  --VERDICT--  &gt;9/10&lt; Despite a few flaws, this game is simply astounding for 3 dollars. Enough levels come bundled in to keep you busy for 2+ hours, depending on how slow you take them, and if you get bored after that, just wait! I'm sure the community will make some great ones soon. If you enjoy chilling out and rolling a marble (technically a ball, it's made of wood) around, then this is a definite reccomendation for you! Thanks for reading!  (If you didn't like the review, I'm sorry! This is my first one EVER. Trying to get better at these...)",
