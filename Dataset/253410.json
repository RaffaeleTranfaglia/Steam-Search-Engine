After the fall of Ravengard, the world descended into chaos. The Kingdom of Tyreas stood alone against a sea of dark elven invaders. The Ravensword was lost, and the dark times began.",

The ambient background music, the lockpicking system, skillgains... Yeah, it's like a crude police sketch of Oblivion.  Looks aside, the game is a very straightforward fetch quest with generic monsters and hardly any content plot-wise. I don't hate it. I might even like it because I'm easily amused. But I wouldn't recommend Ravensword: Shadowlands to anyone, because there are so many RPGs out there that are much better. Even if they're ten years older. Why waste your time playing this when you could play some similar RPG that's much more enjoyable when it comes to combat, puzzles, level design, NPCs and dialogue? Unless you've already played every other game in this particular genre and there's nothing else left...",

The story isn't ground shattering, but it's not bad at all. I am off to play morrowind though haha this game has got me really big into it again... so thanks for that.   One less backlog yeahhhhhh",

            "review_text": "Warmly recommanded! A casual yet fun subpar open-world RPG. Especially good if you do not have tens of hours to spent diving into the land of Tamriel.   Pros: + You can fly on a giant eagle given to you by a waterfall! + You can also ride pterosaurs. I mean, do you have to read more? + You fight giant carnosauts with a crossbow and a sword. Still not convinced? + Fireball spell is actually a firethrower + Runs on low-config old machines + No game-breaking bugs + All the boring parts of an open-world RPG have been ripped off the game + Skill progression is rather entertaining + Nice landscapes + Beautiful music + Ennemies attacks are nicely animated (especially the Raptors) + Easy grinding + Most voices are convincing + You can be everything at once (mage, warrior, thief)  Cons: - No depth in universe and in story - Very limited loot - Maps are empty - No proper dungeons - Lack of challenge - Ennemies are all of equal strength more or less - It is NOT Oblivion or Divinity II or Two Worlds or Risen or Gothic. Nothing of that kind here.   Verdict: A casual, low ambition game, yet seriously fun. Short and fast-paced. And dinosaurs! And flight!   Long version: This game is hard to judge. In every aspect, it tries to remind to you of Oblivion, especially in the first city, where the music is almost the same. And yet it is highly delusional. This game is a CASUAL open-world RPG. Seems paradoxical? Sure it is! A few examples: All merchants buy everything you have to sell at the same price. Lack of immersion, for sure, but it's fast and efficient. Houses are closed if there is no quest inside. People have no name if they do not have something to sell or some quest to give. Maps are quite simplistic, with no caves, no dungeons, only a few wandering ennemies that you can kill at will. They happen to respawn near instantly, but as they are very passive, it is only a massive grindfest.   So, this game is subpar in every aspects. Everything is simplistic; but everything works as it supposed to do. Some landscapes are really nice and charming (the Terraces, for instance), music is nice and epic, fighting system is good, skills are a constant fun to improve, etc. If you can explore the different regions in any order, the game is quite linear in the sense that you have nothing to do in the so-called regions except a meagre handful of straightforward quests.   This game provides a chep yet solid fun, which will content every one who like to hunt Raptors in the swamps with a magical sword and the sound of drums humming in the air.   ",

But i would rate this a 7 out of 10 for nice story line.",

And for only 15 bucks, it more than makes up for the cost in enjoyment.",

I would have kept playing but the controls are the clunkiest I've ever used, sensitivity changes on the mouse seem to have next to no effect (fast then slow then fast then slow; seemly randomly) and the collision detection is awful, I had arrows stopping in midair for no reason at all. The part that really kills the flow of the game is the fact that you can't just use keys to go through menus and are stuck clicking on everything (with the mouse that can't seem to figure out how fast it has to go) which is slow going to say the least. The graphics were alright, nothing great but not the worst and easily overlooked by comparison to the control issues. If the controls and menu navigation were patched then maybe I'd consider playing again, overall just glad I didn't spend much on it thanks to the HB.",

The graphics are VERY outdated, and they should at least create a patch to enhance the graphics. I've already beaten 3 quarters of the game in about 12 hours, which isn't very much gameplay at all. I would only, ever, recommend this game to someone if they wanted Skyrim but their PC couldn't run it, and they couldn't afford it, which even that is highly unlikely since Skyrim is only $20.00 and you can get it on other consoles. The voice acting is terrible, and the combat sucks. They try make the trailer look good, but they couldn't even pull that off, since they show the terrible graphics in the trailer. There isn,t a whole lot of customization options in the game, except for choosing what armor you want to wear. The story is not at all good, and all in all, this game is just a wanna-be Skyrim ported from iphone to the PC. I recommend you use your $6.00 on something else.",

Towns have 1 guard on streets and 1 person in each building. Even in a tavern where you would normally see people and get quests, there's only 1 single person whos the owner at the bar. Each character has like 1 line of spoken dialogue and the rest you must read. Each area on map is the same boring open area with 2 different enemy types, usually animals or something generic like skeletons. Storyline is super boring and run of the mill. There are hilarious things, like how passageways to new areas and caves, are presented as empty rooms with no exit on the other side, which is just lazt programming. There a random spikes in difficulty, like having to fight multiple trolls at once that stun and can kill you in 3 hits. In these cases you never know if you need to grind higher levels or need to get better gear. The leveling system is bad. You gain levels, attributes, talents, and then you also get skills in things by utilizing them more, like bow weaponry, but it continues to have a higher ceiling as you level, and you keep reaching it. But it's never explained what exactly being 45/45 means for damage, etc. especially bc you also have talents and attributes that boost it. Everything you need to buy costs way too much, even simple potions. There is really no magic at all. It's just a bad rpg, although not broken.   5.5/10.",
