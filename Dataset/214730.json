A War Apart adds new content and some bugfixes which makes for a better experience. The Pirate clan added to the game gives it more depth and makes it much more fun to be an actual pirate in the game. You may join them, or you may use their territory as a safe zone. The original game made it very difficult to pirate efficiently. Still, the Dialog remains a little on the dodgy side, not much has changed there. If you played the Reboot and enjoyed it, this is a recommended purchase. For someone new to Space Rangers however, this is a solid game with quite a few modes of play. Whether your quests can take you to do an RTS section or a Text adventure, you aren't forced to do them if they're not your cup of tea. I will say this is a game for an older gamer, and it shows it's age even in this re-release.",

The game is centered around a galactic struggle with a mechanized race known as the Dominators which showed up out of nowhere to give the five main galactic races a pounding. The Space Rangers are the first line of defense against these invaders and are pretty much an autonomous organization built as military and trade support. Players will need to climb up the Ranger ranks, gain new equipment, kill lots of dominators, help research thrive, and eventually take out the three main Dominator command units. How that happens is very open for interpretation.",

NPCs go about their businesses that can have as much impact to the world as the player. + Despite the seemingly simple combat mechanic, those with a tactical mind can still gain an edge  - AI could use some work, but has improved quite a bit since release - Outdated (but workable) 2D graphic - Text quests is sometimes confusing due to poor translation (even though it has been improved over the previous release)  Now if further improvement to AI is implemented...",

Players can choose multiple violent paths to fame and fortune, or even track and predict market variability in an effort to make money through trading.

If you hate RTS or text quests, it is entirely possible to skip all missions that offer those. If you don't like turn-based fighting, then choose a peaceful path of a trader. Alternatively, if you are down to kick some butt, just bully all pirates on your way and destroy dominators. There are countless ways to play the game and I bet anybody will find a way to enjoy it.   This is the only game that got me hooked into its immersive, well thought-out and filled with humour world.  I spent countless hours (possibly 100s) playing the 1st and 2nd part of this series, and I can say that Space Rangers HD is just more balanced among both with better graphics, alternative ending and more weapons. Devs really spend a lot of time working on balance fixes and minor bugs here and there (check patch history).   Overall well polished and diverse game.  10/10 buy with confidence  ",

I was really into leveling up and getting better stuff for a while, but then the tech progression got really slow and there just was not much to buy. To make matters worse the way the game does ship maintainace, it is a percent of the value of everything.   After a while just flying around and having normal wear and tear lead to huge expenses.  In the end, I just got bored of doing the same thing over and over without completing the main story line. I could never 'solo' sectors of dominators and trying to find one where other NPCS we helping out seemed like blind luck. I just got bored of it all and put the game down. For good I think.  I would say, buy it when it is on sale. I really like the idea of the game, its just that the execution was quite rough with just too many annoying things.",

I didn't like the way they changed some of the art and was, until recently, praying for them to add an option to switch with vanilla art, as it seemed a tad more immersive. BUT! the studio behind this remaster is still developing free content for this game and since its release, content progressed quite a bit!  All in all, the resolution upgrade alone makes it worth, especially if you're a fan of the series as I am (and can stomach poor art choices for some base/planet backgrounds and loading screens).  REPLAYABILITY POTENTIAL IS CRAZY HIGH  P.S. Don't underestimate the Adventure portion of this game, its one of its strong points. Feel free to disregard RTS though, its not everyones cup of tea and both the AI and UI is quite primitive (though the AI is hard to beat in many cases!).",

            "review_text": "What can I say about Space Rangers?  Well, my first contact with the game series had been established sometime in 2003/4. I played SR1 a bit and quickly moved on to SR2, which was not an actual sequel but an update. A fact which remained true for every following 'sequel,' didn't know that at the time.  I played SR2 quite extensively over the years, one of two games to which I returned quite often, the other being GTA SA. Once I got a whiff of SR2 Reboot, English version of which trailed behind the Russian release, I grew impenitent over obtaining a copy. Finally it came around on Stardock's Impulse service where, after some proxy shenanigans, I managed to obtain a license of the aforementioned software, leading to quite a lot pleasurable game time.  Of course SR TWA was supposed to be played with burning passion as well. Burning indeed. The game has been extensively updated (both in content and regarding technical aspects) over the years and made even more interesting. To those players who may be inclined toward this type of games.  What type of game is it, you ask, impatient reader? Well, it's an SF roguelike RPG space trader sim riddled with textual quests and packed with arcade and RTS battles. It basically covers all known game genres, with possible exception of triple x rated games, FPS shooters and sports sims. No, you can not play football in SR universe, sorry about that.  Of course not all of these components have been well executed, but that's just how the cookie crumbles. Imagine if the RTS battles didn't suck, the game would be even more attractive and demand even more time. That would just suck. You realize, something has to suck.  Pros: - everything excluding what's listed below  Cons: - I wish the devs had access to more resources so that they may translate ALL the game content into English, instead of having to opt for leaving a part of it out. The game is Russian centric, but instead of seeing this as something negative, one should take this fact for what it is - an excellent opportunity to learn Russian  - as it has been mentioned a number of times, RTS mode sucks. However, it's completely optional, which one doesn't get to see in modern games that often. If at all. These missions can be challenging and rather rewarding, but most of them are quite a chore due to incredibly bad controls and pathing issues  - some consider the arcade black hole mode to be bad, but I personally disagree. While arcade mode is nothing extra super special, it can be a nice way to obtain some otherwise unattainable equipment and provide a break of standard space faring. My qualm over this are possible balancing issues, since you can get quite expensive gear out of the hole fairly early in the game by investing next to nothing into it. Another thing that sucks a bit is the fact that all those weapons which are great in the hole are otherwise useless. And vice versa, so having nice end-game weapons can make the hole problematic to complete. Maybe this was intended by design, IDK really  - I can live with the game being random, however some bits are simply not random. You're practically being cheated now and againg. Two examples: 1. some micromodules are not (to the best of my knowledge and experience) attainable from Ranger Centers. There are a few modules (Universe, Broing, Strongster (which may not be in the game anymore, not sure)) which you'll get to see on about one out of three playthroughs. In ten years playing various versions I got something like 2-3 Universe modules, Broing probably only once and Strongster definitively only once. Not nice, especially since you can regularly come across (usually) pirates having half a dozen of these 2. some dominator gear simply won't drop while using distress signal. I typically check what do they carry before engaging, usually looking for the holy grail of SR (namely the Vertix weapon fixture.) Once I find one that's type H and below 160 weight I spam that dominator with distress signals but the item in question is simply not jettisoned. I understand that obtaining such a powerful weapon too early may pose balancing issues, but that item is quite heavy and expensive to maintain, so it's really not nice to have something like that pulled on an unsuspecting Ranger. Not nice indeed  Room for expansion: - one thing I can't understand is why (after defeating the dominators and before actually finishing the game) existing races stay friendly instead of simply having a showdown, with petty feuding, consorting and what not. That would provide for some after-game entertainment and it would be quite logical conclusion - RTS components in actual space. Something like: 'I have more credits than common sense and want to render this and that system dominator/pirates/coalition proof by means of heavily armored battle stations, private combat ships and what not)' - a unified node account so that your Ranger node account can be used to draw required resources for all your needs, including upgrades and maintaining equipment. It seems silly and cumbersome to lug around 1200 nodes to the nearest science stations to have something upgraded. Seems almost like a bug instead of a missing feature  I think that's about it. As for the sheer size of the world and content, I have to say that even after ten years there's new stuff (not something strictly related to the latest expansion) and game mechanics I encounter from time to time.  Nine out of ten. It took so much time from my life I simply can not rate it any higher than that.",

It has somewhat of a sandbox feel to it because you can progress through the game by fighting dominators,trading,doing quests or just being a pirate .   The main menu has a very nice custom gameplay options which you can use to make it harder or easier on yourself . Also you can get much better starting ship at the cost of some races hating you which is a risk vs reward option .  Probably the most important part of this game is just the fact that it is so visually uniqe and the soundtrack is amazing . It may not be a 3D space game but it still creates very immersive atmosphere .  There are several gameplay types that may appeal to different players . You have a turn based space combat, RTS style ground quests where game completly changes the way it plays , Text Missions for people who enjoy puzzles and twitch space combat inside black holes .  Last but not least is the element of random events. Sometimes you pilot can get a sickness and then you will keep getting money each month as donations from organization fighting that disease. Each time you play the game you may run into a different problem . Sometimes some of the big bosses can come to your system location and kill everyone , forcing you to flee and adapt new tactics .If you set game on hardest diffeculty you can actually loose entire galaxy to pirates &amp; dominators .  It really is a solid game in all aspects . My only complain is that I prefered Dominatos (robots) as main story villains and not Pirates in this expansion . The pirate faction has some issues though because you might get a quest to protect all ships in pirate system which is kidna dumb because its just nearly impossible to do without some serious luck .",

Early on you have to rely a lot on other rangers and military ships to fight the dominators (evil AI) but you can eventually become very powerful and hire up to 6 NPC ships and capture enemy systems by yourself.",

Long story short, this is a universe that really moves and lives on its own without you. I've rushed across galaxies to pick up a new warp drive just to see another ranger get there before me and buy it. I've escaped Galaxies just before they were crushed under robotic oppression. It really is just a great idea and executed well. I wish more games and even other genres would take pointers in their open worlds. Really the only criticism I can give is the ground battles are a little bit uninspired for an rts... they have some good ideas but it just gets very repetitive. But there is literally an option in the game to skip them and never play them, so it's just another example of how they are in touch with their audience.",

            "review_text": "Awesome game, very addictive.  Turn based 2D space sort-of-RPG (RPG because your character has a few stats that you increase for XP, you customize equipment of your ship, and because you can roleplay your own path - be a corsair, trader, mercenary, goody-two-shoes hero...), arcade minigame (in back holes), real time strategy missions (sometimes on inhabited planets), old fashioned text based minigames (some missions on inhabited planets, also if you get thrown into prison).  The game world (galaxy is randomly generated for each gameplay) is very alive and goes on regardless of your progress - you can affect it, of course (and various alien races will like or hate you for your actions), but it doesn't stop and wait just because you decided to waste time (or got thrown into prison :D ).  There are basically three warring factions, out of which two you can join, the third are the main bad guys. These factions actively mount offensive and defense of their territory and take over planetary systems from each other (in case of the bad guys there are also three sub-factions that fight each other). At the beginning of a playthrough you are just a small fish in a sea of sharks (on higher difficulties i definitely don't recommend to take part in the war, before you have some decent ship and equipment), and by the end you will be liberating systems pretty much single-handedly.  The economy part of the game (i.e. trading commodities and change of prices) is nicely done. NPC ships fly around trade commodities and buy new equipment (so the equip stores are not just for you - if you see that there is a nice peace of equip on some distant planet, you may want to hurry).  Terrific alien races.  The ship equipment, variety of weapons and variety of equipable or usable artefacts is also very nicely done.  Quality of available equpment changes over playthrough, depending on how much in-game time has passed.  A few negatives that need mentioning though - in RTS part, AI of your units is dumb as a tree stump, much micromanagement required, at least in my experience - in RTS you can't save, so you have to do everything in one go, which is inconvenient (it however also prevents save-scam and thus increases difficulty which is nice, albeit sometimes a little frustrating) - the GUI could be a little confusing for a new player (easy solution, just try out all the buttons on screen and see what they do) - it is easy to mess up the beginning if you don't know what you're doing and the in-game tutorial doesn't cover everything (saving often helps and i'd recommend to start one playthrough on easy and play it at least for an hour or two to learn the basics)",

For example, there is a tutorial that teaches you all the basics of how to fight ship to ship, and trade, and do missions, and see how the planetside RTS works... but whatever you actually try is a dismal failure. Do you like trying to grab a bit of mineral debris with repeated commands only to be mystified that it always takes about 3 tries? Is your education in system-based combat of any use when any encounter you wind up in you are likely going to be totally ventilated? Howabout a tutorial on how to play the RTS that literally allows itself to get bogged down until you AND the enemy run out of resources? I wanted to like this game and gave it several shots. Ulitimately life is too short. I had to give up. Try at your own peril.",

Your game play will consist of running planet to planet praying for a fight of some kind ... someone, anyone to fight.

The randomly generated gear is often useless ... whole planets have 10-20 items for sale. Do not buy this game for full price, find it in a bundle somewhere. If I had paid full price for this game instead of getting it in a $5 bundle I would be asking for my money back.  The game needs to allow you to use bigger ships, or have more than one ship.",

Fine, at least I know they're coming, I can be ready for them'.  Yeah, nah, you're ♥♥♥♥ed. Your guns can't do any significant damage to them and your shields are like butter  'Maybe I'm doing something wrong. Perhaps I went to the wrong planet?' Nope, your Instructor decided to send you to a planet orbited by two guys who want nothing more than to ♥♥♥♥ up your day.  So I give it up as a bad idea.  Decided to give it another try today. New game, knowing my instructor is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who will sell me out. Upgrade shields, weapons and engines...  Still ♥♥♥♥ed. Bad guys are even tougher than they were the first time, and I'm somehow doing even less damage.  And all this is still in the first three missions of the tutorial. Aparently all it is going to teach you is that the game, which looks like it could have been a fun top-down space epic, is ♥♥♥♥ed.  Don't waste your money.",

I played for 2 hours just to give it a good test... here is how it goes. I started a game by choosing at random in a load of what seem to be pointless options. The game proposed me a tutorial after read about a dozen wall of texts. The game even lampshades it's being annoying by doing so. I hurt my eyes looking at the small print everywhere. Then I bought some probes, when to explore mercury (sounded like a good idea) and when outside of mercury, some pirate asked for twice my total money otherwise it kills me. Then a second one joined. Now I can't leave the planet - not that I could beat the first one. After a half hours of tests I managed to kill them (with the help of random military ships in the system) but 2 more joined... and I spend most of my money repairing my ship. It feels like endless grind. I didn't even play 2 hours.  Apart from the obviously bad balancing in this game (really ? getting camped in the STARTING SYSTEM ???), combat done in the tutorial feels VERY bland, just point in a direction and shoot automatically if you didn't forget to ask it to shoot. Inventory is very small, there seems to be about 8 things possible to trade, repair costs are prohibitive, mini-games... uhg. I started the 'robot war' thingy. Ok, it kind of does allow for infinite money in the main game at the cost of not playing the main game. It's about as fun as the 'just before space' war in spore with the Fun part taken out of it. Oh wait, there is no fun part in that phase of spore... and this is even worse. Trading is... trading. Mining is shooting at ships and waiting for more asteroids to come. Exploration consists in loading probes and clicking 'end turn' until it's done - and mostly you can't take everything beause inventory is sooo small. And the walls of text in very small print which hurt my eyes on top of it.  I imagine that some of the defects I speak of are alleviated later in the game, but the start did such a good job in disgusting me I can't even think of going to look.  I can't recommend this. It's game like that which keeps the space games down. I'm glad I got it in a sale for 5 euros, but it's not even worth this low amount of money.  PS: Sadly, this game shows the limitations of the review system in Steam. When a game has a 'cult' following a load of hardcore fans flock to the game, block bad reviews, and flood the store with 'good' reviews. Don't be fooled, this game is fully deserving of the low reviews it deserves on metacritic.",

            "review_text": "I really wanted to like this game. No, I REALLY wanted to like this game. It reminded me of another space exploration/ combat/ merchant game I used to love to play called Escape Velocity. This was slightly different, what with the turn based movement/ combat and a RTS-type aspect with the ground combat. But I thought that would just add to the enjoyment.   My biggest problem with this game (and the reason I uninstalled it) is that they tell you nothing about anything. You are thrown to the wolves from day one. They do have a minor tutorial that 'instructs' you how to play. It took me dying 5 times in the tutorial (THE TUTORIAL) to realize that most of the useful information is displayed as a microscopic toolbar down in the bottom left of your screen. After I saw that, I actually managed to make it past the tutorial only to die promptly thereafter to a random pirate (this wasn't in hard mode, mind you). Also, there are so many little markings and symbols that don't have a description. These things should be helping you, but instead just make me ask, 'Why give me descriptors that are in no way descriptive or helpful?' There are 2 very different combat modes (one of which they don't bother explaining at all). All-in-all, this game was just massively frustrating.  This could be an AMAZING game. All they would have to do is help you understand how the game works. Instead, they throw you the (incomplete) Dummies guide to brain surgery and say, 'good luck, sucker.' I will gladly pick it up again if I learn that they have added an actual descriptive explanation of how to play the game.",
