            "review_text": "This game has many flaws, but is still of good value to  hardcore  hidden-object game lovers, especially those who enjoy the world of Al Emmo.  There is no point-and-click adventuring, and the puzzles aren't especially challenging or interesting. The hidden object scenes are plagued with stylistic incoherence, low-rez objects that barely look like what they're supposed to be, and repetition.  However... there are a  lot  of hidden-object scenes, enough content to keep you busy for a good few hours. Again, if you don't absolutely love such games, you will likely hate this one.  I played as Koko, and can't get enough of him! He's hilarious!",
