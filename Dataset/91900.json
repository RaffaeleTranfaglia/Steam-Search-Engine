So, complains about the 'unrealistic physics' are just stupidity. It's like complaining that Mario Kart is not realistic! 2nd, the game is too short. Now, it is true that there are too few tracks and too few cars, but the game actually runs very well with no bugs at all and it is actually fun for some fast destruction racing with friends. And 3rd, the graphics are not top quality. But in my opinion, they are good enough. (Actually, I just can't understand why people give so much importance to graphics on games. Fabulous graphics may impress you at first, but after some minutes you get used to it and your entertainment will actually rely much more on other aspects, not on the graphics, unless it's so bad that it hampers gameplay, which is rare and definitely not the case here) Though there are better titles out there, it's 44 metascore is simply absurd. This is not the first time I see a totally misleading metascore. I can't trust it anymore after this one.",

            "review_text": "Post Apocalyptic Mayhem is one of those games where everything sounds good on paper, but the execution is lacking.  I guess this is supposed to be a racing game, but the arcade &amp; challenge modes revolve around blowing up as many rivals as possible. This is accomplished by grabbing weapons off the track. Players can equip weapons for the front, sides, and rear. There's also a boost for catching up to the...mayhem. With a multitude of tracks and a variety of cars to drive, this game gets a pass in terms of content.  In practice though...ehhh...hmmm..oh uh well shoot. There's really no incentive for actually trying to race. The winner is determined solely by # of kills. At this point, why not just have a big arena? Make it a car combat game like the Twisted Metal series. Actually that wouldn't work because most of the weapons are designed for a racing game. It's a head-scratcher of the a design-decision, since it applies to the entirety of the single-player. There is a multiplayer mode for racing, but everyone is going to destroy each other anyway(or at least they would if anyone played this game online).   All that said, it isn't really a big deal. I'm just annoyed as hell because while playing the game I got hit with a nasty bug. At one point the game gets stuck on a loading screen. It stinks but it happens. I bring up the task manager, but the game pops right back up with its infinite loading. I try to bring up task manager again, and the loading screen comes right back. This freakin' game was trying to hold my computer hostage! I had to restart the PC just to get out of that mess. That little experience soured me on the entire game. As soon as everything was back to normal, I uninstalled this piece of crap with the quickness. I'm not saying it could happen to you, but what if it did?  What...if...it...did?   I wasn't feelin' it anyway. The game isn't even compelling enough to grind out a few achievements for. The loading-screen bug was the 2x4 that broke the camel's back.",

We want to go around corners at high speed on turbo and go flying though the air without skidding off into some over graphicfied building. Some say the graphics look cartoonish, they are far from poor and a lot of detail and design has gone into the cars and levels. I actually prefer 'game looking' graphics more than 'real world' type graphics. I drive miles each week on the M1 personally, why the heck would I want to come home and look at more of the same ? I wan't to get away from the 'real world' and enjoy playing game which look like game, not like the past 2 hours of stuff I have been looking at.   The AI drivers could be a little better, but they can more than give you a good race. Play with friends no problem! Blow them up with rockets or donuts or whatever you want, which gives the game a little bit more fun than just going around a fancy looking racetrack all day thinking 'wow the graphics are so cool' which isn't playing a game IMHO. The graphics are good in PAM even considering its a old game now.   We have tried other racing games and really do not get on with them at all. So if your alike and want something easy and fun to play then give PAM a try! Its next to nothing in price. My only bad thoughts are the are not many tracks, I think 7 after the bonus pack. They are big tracks and even after playing for several hours we can still manage to get lost in them. I really wish they made more tracks or a editor for PAM, possibly more cars too. Though we will be playing it for the foreseeable future for sure! Well worth a couple of quid! ",

The game looks really great. And by really great I mean someone took FlatOut, smeared lip vaseline all over it and then sprayed twenty boxes of neon graffity on the mess. It is almost painful to look. It doesn't help that the main menu looks like something you would get from a happy meal. The music is... Well... Give me a second... Erm... Is there any music in this game anyway? Sorry, I won't bother turning it on for the sake of writing a recommendation, but if there IS any music, it is bland, uninspiring and almost annoying - the type of 'music' you would make by mashing two metal dumpster lids together while shouting: 'Old MacDonald had a farm' out of rythm. The fake sound of engine on full throttle doesn't help that much either - it sounds twice worse than a four year old immitating a F-1 engine sound - and six times as annoying. The gameplay is so much FUN! Well, it WOULD be, if you wouldn't get bored after three minutes. There are like 8 or something cars, with 4 more if you are willing to shell out cash. (Please don't. Please. Give the DLC money to charity or something, just don't buy the DLC). The cars differ visually, sure, but SLIGHTLY by stats, and really little by abilities - instead of yellow waste, you shoot green booze, omigosh. Although the idea of anything-goes wipeout racing is really great, this game manages to eff it up anyway. There are 4 powerups in the game - your front attack, your back attack, your side attack and nitro. You get those in kind of a Mario Kart principle. And that's it. There is literally 0 depth here. Like, if you look at the game's storepage for four and a half seconds, you MASTERED IT! Congratulations. There won't be any cake. You might think that the if you manage to cross the finish line first, you win. But no. You need to get the most KILLS! Sure. Next time in the Olympics, we will cheer for the sprinter who stabbed the most athletes in the neck. Basically, it all comes down to stupid, no strategy involved carnage. And not the good type of carnage, where you kick a table into a window and break the window, the table AND a poor passerby in slow-motion. This is the type of carnage where you and seven other freaks on a 7 year steroid-only diet have a race to punch a brick wall and the first who breaks his arm completely wins. A free trip to a hospital.  Please, don't even consider this game. It's painful to play (figuratively), it's painful to write about (literally, my arm has been cut and every single word I write is out of the sheer willpower that this game must not reach the hands of fellow citi-gaaaaaaaaaaaah. Sorry. I'm bleeding. I should stop now). The idea was good, but it's burried somewhere in between the lipstick-smeared graphics, ear-bleeding noise, fatally boring gameplay and all the blood that's coming out of my arm.",

To win you just get away a bit, collect weapons and spam rear attack. Or don't try hard and just have a fun. And multiplayer is even worse. Most of weapons are made so you use while racing. But because there's no point in it, they can be simply avoided by slowing down. I don't say adding a real race mode would make this game better. As I said, player who got away at start will spam rear attacks and he will be unbeatable. And I didn’t even mention graphics or awful handling (most first person shooters have better car physics).
