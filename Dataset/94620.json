            "review_text": "This game, a hillarious and wildly inappropriate throwback to the ancient Sierra/Lucasarts/Telltale point-and-click adventures of yesteryear.  Perhaps it is because I was raised on King's Quest, Sam &amp; Max, and Monkey Island, but these games have always had a special place for me.  Though I am convinced there are no more than 2 voice actors at the most, this fully-voiced adventure is chock-full of offensive innuendo, double entrendre, and bizarre british insults.  From obnoxious 'Chav' teenagers, morbidly obese strippers, porn shop enthusiasts, blind perverts, and angry old ladies with tazers, the conversations had me rolling with laughter throughout. Coupled with the crass bitterness of the alchoholic main character, and goofy puzzles, there was entertainment without too steep or shallow of a difficulty curve.  I bought the entire series for 5 bucks, a downright steal for 3 games, and though my experience with this genre may have shortened the playtime to a few hours per episode.",

            "review_text": "You might think this is just a low budget indie game with questionable taste, but you can tell that the developers put in a lot of time and effort. The story is actually pretty good and the puzzles are logical for once. Sure, it's a crude and offensive kind of logic, but at least it makes some sense. If I had to ding the game for anything it would be the poor voice acting, but otherwise the developers took a game that might be crossing the line and turned into something hilarious, fun, and full of British insults.  7/10",

            "review_text": "A very witty series that really captures the essence of what is needed in a point n' click comedy atmosphere. The game is unapologetically crude in the best possibly way-- at times hilariously insulting on just about every front you can think of.  The puzzles are not overly difficult but not ridiculously obvious either. The characters are incredibly memorable and I found myself giggling like an idiot every time Hector uttered 'Ballbags' in one of the funniest exaggerated cockney british accents I think I've ever heard. The length of the game is as expected: A sweet but predictably short venture through a variety of purpose-driven environments. A few environments were re-used in later episodes than EP1, but generally very tastefully so. Less of an issue if you bought all episodes at once so it feels more like one package than individual installments re-using areas.  All in all I can overwhelmingly recommend it whenever it is on sale. I do believe, considering the short duration, it should not have a pricetag of 20 USD however. Nonetheless I can't -NOT- recommend a game with such golden comedic moments as I had with this one. If you're in the mood for a laugh from sheer absurdity, grab it.",
