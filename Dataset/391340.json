            "review_text": "Ferrum's Secrets: Where Is Grandpa? is a HOG game from an indie dev, it's main feature is its 3D.  The pros: You can choose the difficulty as in most of the HOGs: casual, advanced and expert mode. 3D environment, when you click on a place to investigate it the camera pans and zoom on it Music/ambiance is nice and soothing Story is really interesting and intriguing Dev is obviously a cat lover, like me :)  The cons: No sound options but there's almost no sounds anyway, only music; it's very odd. The story is badly told: no intro whatsoever and all the bits of story are hidden in the journal (which isn't even pointed at by the tutorial!) or in hidden notes scattered in the game. That's definetly not a good way to tell a story -.-   Plus the very rare story texts stay on screen for a too short time, they should wait for an input instead. Throughout the game a lot of centered texts pop up could have been added to explain the player progression, instead of a small 1 line text displayed on top of the screen for 2 seconds exactly. The 3D enviromenment makes everything like a maze so a few holding hands texts would help. Funnily enough, clicking around aimlessly makes a big window of text appear and nags you for looong seconds. And you'll see it often since you cannot see your way or because you're trying to find what you're supposed to do to advance.  The mini games are awful: obscure, with no explanation. The 3D view made the first one annoying and confusing, the second one had buttons and lamps that were too tiny. Luckily they can be skipped. Mini games should be totally scrapped and redone.  The HOG screen are too dark and uninspired and the lack of sound while picking objects make it very odd. The objects to pick are ugly, texture-less and sometimes tiny. The first HOG screen was nice, but the rest quickly went downhill.  Most of the screens are too dark (really!!) and it's hard to see the useful items in there. Tools are all amost black, and the hidden collectibles are almost white. the whole house being almost pitch black is funny since the missing grandpa was an electrician, he obviously wasn't very skilled haha... So maybe an angry customer got his revenge! ^^  Navigating in the rooms is not obvious at all, you'll often miss other room entrances unless you  pointed your mouse on the correct exact pixel. Navigations arrows would help.   I cannot help but think that the number one sale argument of the game - it being in 3D - quickly  becomes its cons as it makes The navigation too confusing. Add to that the screens being too dark, the lack of sound and the lack of dialogues and story. The game would benefit from a bit of patching and updating - it feels unfinished as it is. The base is really good, but it definetly doesn't feel finished.   It was a bit hard to decide whether to upvote or downvote. I don't want to punish the game with a No as it doesn't deserve it, but I wish there was a Meh vote instead. As for me I didn't even finish the game, couldn't stand the never ending dark room after dark room after dark room with not a slight idea of what I'm doing or going. I gave up in 'Living Room II'. It's just not fun. I love HOGs games but this one is more a tech demo. The game already have a lot of No votes so I'll upvote it instead, in the hope of it being updated one day and because I want to encourage the dev.",

            "review_text": "This is something of a milestone here at the HOGuru's Haunt. That name is not going to catch on, I'm guessing. The milestone, though, is something else - this is the first all-3D HOG I've even encountered. It may be the only all-3D HOG there is, although I'll have to do some research into that. I'm used to the occasional 3D backdrop, and I've seen plenty of 3D animated cutscenes, but Ferrum Secrets is the first time I've seen someone build an entire world out of polygons and then dump a bunch of items in one place and expect me to sift through them. Based on this audacity alone Ferrum deserved a look, and I was certainly surprised by what I found.  Criteria 1: To what degree do the puzzle screens look like a thrift store vomited on my monitor?  Almost not at all. This is the first thing I noticed about Ferrum Secrets - objects seem less random and arbitrary in 3D. I'm sure this is partially a factor of the novelty, but the internal consistency of having the various clickable items all made of the same basic lines and textures as its surroundings massively simplified the struggle of getting artwork to match that so bedevils 2D HOGs. This could easily sound like damning with faint praise - 'everything looks terrible, so the objects fit right in!' - but that's not my take on it at all. While the environments may be primitive, harkening back to the days of Myst or D, the locations they depict - a trashed house, a run-down factory - are the kinds of places one would expect to have scattered piles of refuse, so setting HOSs there seems natural.  Criteria 2: Are the searches justified by the premise/story?  Not entirely - the hidden object screens are largely of 12:1 construction, other than one diversion to find plants for a potion. The game's developers at least recognize that this is an issue, so they cover up the problem with a figleaf explanation, having their heroine announce that she should 'clean up' the various areas if she's ever going to find the item she needs. The screens aren't then constructed so that a variety of items actually have to be removed in order to find the important one, but at least some effort is being put in.  Criteria 3: How well do the various puzzles and object searches meld together to form a coherent whole?  The game is all over the map here. While I applaud the interesting choice of engine and art style, it's impossible to overlook how shoddy and random much of the construction is. The HOSs are well-designed, and there are some fairly clever puzzles - especially one that takes advantage of the 3D camera to let players move around a series of pipes that they need to turn on and off. The story around them is just odd, almost as if it was cobbled together around the assets that they developers had on hand, rather than starting with the plot and constructing from there.  The story concerns an evil fog that has fallen over a city, and the disappearing scientists who are somehow involved in its creation. Nothing wrong with that, other than the fact that there's no fog to be seen in the vast majority of the game. The most puzzling thing, however, is a strange interlude in which a witch helps the player brew a potion to cure an arbitrary illness they gained in the previous chapter. If it seems like the witch in question looks like she's ready to his something with a magic staff, that's because she's obviously a pre-made model that the developers simply dropped into the game, irrespective of how it fit into the setting. It's incredibly jarring to be playing a game about stopping a steampunk zeppelin from using chemical weapons on a metropolis and then suddenly have a sidequest send me into a magical dungeon to find reagent. The whole sequence obviously exists only to pad out the game's extremely short running time, so I was understanding - but it still derails attempts at narrative pretty badly.  Despite its extremely short running time and fairly basic puzzles/HOSs (I neglected to mention, but 3D hidden objects are much easier to find than 2D ones), I was fascinated by Ferrum Secrets. Yes, that's entirely due to the fresh concept, but if nothing else, this game should encourage other developers to take risks with the genre. This isn't a great game, but as a proof of concept that HOGs can work in far more broad environments than had previously been believed, it might just be an important one.",

            "review_text": "    Ferrum's Secrets: Where Is Grandpa?   is a hidden object and puzzle game. Your grandfather, an inventor, has disappeared and it is up to you to piece together the clues and find out what happened to him.   Pros : The game is very easy to pick off, even for people with no experience of the genre. You have a couple of areas to explore, offering a few puzzles of different types: hidden objects, tile flipping, object assembly to name a few. The story is told through scattered notes you find and a few interaction with other people you encounter. There are different collectibles to find wiithin each difficulty level, requiring multiple playthroughs to get them all.   Cons : The text has serious syntax flaws, part of which is incomprehensible, and has in all appearances been translated to English through a poor man's Google Translator. The story seems to have been thought up by a child. I mean,  the evil owner of an 'engine company' capturing an 'electricity scientist' to sell his inventions to gangs that use them to kill people  sounds like the plot of an 80s Saturday morning cartoon episode. Graphics and 3D object models are easily put to shame by games such as the 1993 version of  Myst , while music is recycled from other games (assuming there is any sound at all in the area you're in). In addition to lacking variety, the puzzles are extremely easy or simply make no sense (use a wrench on a push-button to fix electrical wires. Wait, what?). The game is short and un-engaging, achievement hunters are likely to be the only ones caring about a second and third playthrough.   Verdict : ★☆☆☆☆ - May it rot in your backlog  I said this game was easy for newcomers to hidden objects games, but I wouldn't recommend it even to them as it's a poor example of what can be expected in the genre and might even scare some away. This is an amateur project, unworthy of people spending any money on it. Don't buy, just...don't.  —————————————————————————   This was just my opinion.   If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated)  reviews . ",

            "review_text": "I was completely disgusted to find that expert mode puts a fairly tight timer on you, no just in the hidden object scenes but in general gameplay. Back to the start you go, try it again. Not my idea of fun. Trying to get the second collectible threw me out, and I thought I'd been playing fairly quickly. Anyway - definitely two thumbs on on that. If you like achievements and you can't be super quick, you'll have a hard time getting past 80%.",
