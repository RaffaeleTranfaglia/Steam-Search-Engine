            "review_text": "Temporal Invasion certainly is worth getting if you are into sleuth, riddle-solving, and mind-boggling puzzles; as long as you can bear with the overly present grammar errors--which is ironic given that the game is text-driven, you would think that the studio would have allotted more resources to this aspect of the game. While the concept and premise of the game is great, it falls short on delivery. The game provides a nagging vibe of being an upgraded--or simpy ported--flash game with mediocre interactable interface, poor story line delivery, and a confusing plot which just happens to be all over the place.   Pros and Cons:  Intriguing but badly narrated plot riddled with grammatical errors Challenging puzzles, albeit partly due to the language used Multi-dimensional riddles (combination of decryption, word analysis, math, and tons of googling and wikis) but bad recognition filter for solutions (e.g. Abraham Lincoln will not be considered for Abe Lincoln) Low resolution images for clues (some of which were grabbed directly from the internet - hope no rights were infringed there)  But if you got $2 and countless hours to spare, do get this game. (2/5)",

This game will really test your resourcefulness, out of the box thinking, etc. You will absolutely love it especially if you are more into investigative puzzle solving games, (if once in your life you've dreamed to become a detective) :D   This is actually the first time I write a review for a Steam purchased game. So I guess that explains everything :D",

            "review_text": "My first puzzle game in a long while. Even though the main story is odd, the puzzles are great albeit a little easy at least for now as in the moment of writing I only finished the first case of ten. Eventhough the music is a little repetetive it gives a good atmosphere. The UI can be slightly clunky but it does the job. With it not having hints and the whole concept of the game making you writte codes on paper, googling stuff almost makes you feel like you are a spy. If you like puzzles, conspiracy theories and you don't have the attention span of a fly this game is a must buy especially with this price tag.",
