    "description": "The Rain fell, and washed away all that was good. Ancestors of the survivors face a world plagued by deadly disease, hostile landscapes that offer no safe haven, and brutal warlords beholden to a malevolent A.I. that seeks to enslave mankind and control the natural world. This is life After Rain.",
