            "review_text": "I got a key after i got the game refunded because i couldn't get it working.    I found this game and really wanted to try it at first sight, and with only ten dollars i went digging through my room and found ten more and bought the game. I downloaded all the DLC and started it, but Steam froze and i thought 'this is what is supposed to happen.'. I got tired of waiting for it to start right up and closed Steam because it was still frozen. After opening Steam again i tried to start the game again only to get a message saying the game was already running. Confused, i went into my task manager and found the processes running. I tried to close them but i couldn't without restarting my pc. I kept trying after receiving Developer support and i decided to get a refund.   A few days after this, i reveived a message from a developer asking for help with getting the game working, and i accepted their generous key and downloaded the game. I started it up and to my suprise it worked right away, and after it worked i installed all the DLC, and they worked too.   Im not sure how it happened, or if they released an update, but i love the game!   Thanks to the devs for being so nice and helping me even when they couldn't!  I would totally recommend this to anybody who loves simulators!",
