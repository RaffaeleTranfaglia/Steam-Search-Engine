If you are looking for gameplay like shooting/zombies or whatever, please stay away from this and save your penny, because this is just not for you.  If you are more to a story person, I would say   GRAB IT NOW  , it worth more than a penny! Now...I shall be continue my journey",

The story, atmosphere, soundtrack and locations were still there in this sequel to the original. Other than the combat (clunky controls), everything else is great about this game. Yes It follows a different style than TLJ, but a lot of the original elements that made TLJ great are still there.",

The whole game made me wish for less tacked-on combat and stealth and more of the point-and-click puzzle solving that made TLJ a great game. The few puzzles it did feature weren't much of a challenge and didn't require much logical thinking to solve.  Still, the voice acting, environments, and entertaining characters made this game worth playing. I loved seeing all of the familiar faces as well as some interesting new characters. Despite being released in 2006, the environments delivered some solid scenery porn that holds up today. The story was also compelling enough to make me play to the end.  With Dreamfall Chapters in development, this is a must play. If you can overlook its shortcomings and focus on the story, you'll definitely enjoy Dreamfall: The Longest Journey.  ",

For everyone else, sadly... not so much. First of all, it's hardly a game (ok, so maybe 25% game, 75% interactive story) - but since most people buy games expecting... well, gameplay... it's hard to recommend from that standpoint. But as I said, for fans of the original, it is an amazing continuation of the story. The developers fixed my main issues with the original and really tightened up the dialogue and storytelling. In that respect, it is nearly superb, and worth playing for alone. But the uninspired puzzles (i.e. fetch quests) and combat sections really bring down the 'game' part of the equation. Add one final major insult in the lack of an actual ending, and it's really hard to recommend for those who never played the original. But for those fans, it is simply not to be missed. PS - for best results, use a gamepad!",

Unlike The Longest Journey its a full 3D game with the player perspective shifting between three distinct characters and, while the visuals are nonetheless impressive, it feels much more clunky than The Longest Journey's 2.5D animations.  The characters are likeable enough and the return of some fond favourites does still keep the series trademark sense of humour; I'm looking at you Crow! Even so, I wouldn't rate it as highly as The Longest Journey, but it still hits those important 'life as a journey' ideas and questions.  ***Potential Spoiler Alert***  Additionally, to those that might be put off by the rather abrupt abd confusing ending, Dreamfall was never meant to be a standalone game but part of a trilogy which, due to unforeseen circumstances, was cut a little short. Thankfully, Red Thread Games will (or have depending on when you read this review) be releasing Dreamfall Chapters which will not only finish the games stroyline. but also start new ones with new characters; and hopefully some old ones too(?).",

            "review_text": "This entire series has been amazing and definitely worth looking into. My first experience was on the Xbox 360 with my dad, however somewhere in the middle of the game my xbox had met its fatal end and I was never able to complete the game back when I was in Elementary school. When I first found that it was available for PC and it was on steam I was so excited I bought it right away, yet didn't play it. Instead I looked into it's predecessor 'The Longest Journey'. The game is ten times more satisfying if you have previous knowledge or experience playing the first game 'The Longest Journey' in April Ryan's point of view. I couldn't be bothered actually playing the first game myself since I have a hard time getting into games with really low graphics, so Instead I watched an entire playthrough of the first game no commentary before starting the second one. I am super glad I did, since they referenced several things from the first game and acknowledged characters that I could actually recognize, it was just so satisfying to be able to recognize them.  The only thing I didn't like about the game was the lack of consequence or choice effect in the game, whether you chose to do one thing or not didn't effect anything in the story. The most difference it did was effect one aspect of gameplay to make something harder or difficult, like silently disarming a guard or attacking them full on, going the long way around, or taking a short cut. The only differences were dialogue, and even then, most of the dialogue was mandatory to read anyways leaving little to none replayability.  At the same time, I liked that there was lack of choices I know I'm contradicting myself... It was telling you a story in the way they visioned it instead of you putting your own input to it. I loved it, to it's very end.   I also got super excited hearing the news of the third installment Dreamfall Chapters, and knowing that the choices DO actually effect storyline and have tons of replayability.   10/10 Definitely worth playing, Highly recommend playing or watching a playthrough of the first game beforehand though.   P.S The Soundtrack is beautiful.   ",

You're welcome. Sorry there is no option to get her to stop talking so goddam much.  -------- Review continuation: I started playing this game in June 2013. Finished playing it in July 2014. If you're interested in the game, you already know its not the most 'graphically beautiful.' With their limitations, they still produce some impressive areas. For whatever reason though, the game taxes my graphic card worse than today's TF2. While on the High setting, the fan whirrs more louder and faster than FFXIV. Poor optimizing?  As far as recommending, I'm kinda torn. - Awful controls: Really really awkward. Playstation 1 awkward. - Ridiculous writing: I don't want to throw down the feminism card, but there are a LOT of hints towards it. There's a quote in there saying something to the effect of, 'And this is why women should rule the world'. Character dialog leaves NOTHING to the imagination. Words. So many ♥♥♥♥ing words. You can't guess or infer what a character is thinking or feeling. They tell you. They don't stop telling you. Even the male characters will rattle on about every ♥♥♥♥ing feeling in the sun they are feeling. Holy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥. I get that the character models are not fluidly animated, but jesus tapdancing christ--- the audience can get what two characters are feeling by the music and setting. - Bat ♥♥♥♥ insane story that switches (yes, switches) between Sci-Fi and Medieval Fantasy. - Main character doesn't shut up. - Puzzles are easy. Navigating is the difficult part.   + Pretty cool story. Its maybe unique? Well.. not really. + The settings are well defined. + Music is nice. + Setting is very well defined. Once again, they really did a great job there. + Right clicking will skip through a line of dialog.   Do all girls talk that much? I wouldn't know. I've never had a girlfriend before.

I played it when it was first released and decided to re-buy it on Steam thinking I should give it another chance, but...nope.  It's visually stunning, and it's nice to see what became of April's friends in Stark. But I will never understand what possessed them to follow up a point-and-click adventure game with a game that requires precision and dexterity (and uses half-baked combat and movement controls that make precision nearly impossible). If I wanted to play a sneaking or fighting game, I'd play Thief or Half-Life.  The interactive conversations from Longest Journey are also gone, replaced with console-friendly cutscenes where you have little input into the dialogue.  It's pretty clear that they made this as a console game and put zero thought into how to port it to PC. The end result is an exercise in frustration with a storyline that just stops in the middle with no conclusion.  Here's hoping Dreamfall: Chapters is an actual adventure game instead of a badly-ported console fighting game.",

It wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for the awful combat and bad controls that make the combat even harder.  The pace of the game is much slower than the first and has a lot of running back and forth with more loading screens and pointless item fetching.  Pros:  Story is part of the same universe with same characters. Some areas have nice graphics if a little old looking. Logic puzzles can be fun to play.  Cons:  Bad acting. Low quality cut scenes that don't help the atmosphere. Terrible combat. Pointless and annoying stealth sections. Slow death scenes that you can't skip.   I'm only playing this becasue I bought it and I want to follow the story, it's either boring or frustrating in many parts of the game which let down the few good parts it has.  Would have been better as a standard 2D point and click or if they removed the combat and stealth sections.  Buy it if you must own all the games in the series, otherwise avoid it, there are many games better than this under the adventure game tag.",

About 80% of the time you have no indication of where you are supposed to go, no map, no quest indicator and no description of the way except 'at the south gate' or 'to the ghetto'. No compass either btw to get to South Gate. The best bet ist always: at the exact opposite end of the town, alternating between the ends of town of course, so you can fully enjoy the about 8 loading screens - you encounter them about literally every 10 meters of way. The story at least tries to continue the story of the first game 'The Longest Journey' and you encounter quite a lot of places and characters from that game, but unfortunately makes no sense at all contrary to the first game. There it made some sense to appear in a new world in your underwear as you traveled while sleeping. Here it seems to happen all the time - probably to distract from the lack of sense it all makes....

I have read the reviews for this game before starting the adventure and thought how bad could it be since the first game - The Longest Journey was so good.   First thought was this game appealed mostly to teenagers because the there were boys, best friends, lost of direction, love interest and etc.   I wanted to play as April Ryan and continue with her journey but all I got was thousand cutscenes while I played as 3 characters - Zoe, April and Kaidan - (diregard the first). I liked the idea because I could see different perspective of people towards the characters and the characters perspective towards the people. If Kaidan was not involved, I think I would have connected with Zoe but still, my expectation was to play as APRIL RYAN. She have changed alot in 8 years and I feel sad for her.   Compared to the first game, there are less gameplay, less choices of interaction and less puzzles. But they introduced new elements such as fight scene and new places in different countries and 3 worlds?   The whole journey was interesting but somewhat dissatisfying because you are left with questions at the end of the game. And for how long? I just played for 11.2 hours. That makes sense when the journey just happened in 2 weeks but certainly it was not the longest journey.   Basically, the two things I liked were the visuals, it had improved tremendously compared to TLJ and the storyline. The storyline was interesting and easy to follow. The music, gameplay, character depthness were okay but not so great.   Overall game rating: 5/10  Overall review: Expectation not met. I want more April Ryan and not the other way around.

To add insult to injury there are some incredibly out-of-place combat and stealth scenes, all of which cause insta-death if you press the wrong button. And yet... the world of The Longest Journey is a rich and beautiful one. The fantasy half isn't my cup of tea, but the sci-fi half is great, and the ending is extremely compelling. All the pain of the earlier parts of the game go away when the story truly unfolds. The denouement does go on a little long - i wish they had ended at a particularly poignant fade-out (you'll understand when you get there), but it's still got a real emotional impact and some very cool ideas.",

            "review_text": "TLDR: I recommend and not recommend at the same time, see below.  After playing TLJ, it is clear that Dreamfall is a different game that 'follows' the storyline of the former. I am quoting 'follow' because the events take place 10 years after. However, the game feels very different both in gameplay and story, so I think it should be viewed as a standalone game.  Gameplay wise, it is fully 3D with heavy reliance on conversations. Not many puzzles that challenge your mind at all. Inventory is reduced to a minimum and normally you keep forward just by walking your way to your objectives (some running forth and back too). The game features stealth and combat, which is made in a poor fashion. Stealth mechanics are kind of ok, but forces you to press a key (def. key control) all the time, instead of just toggle stealth with a key. Probably one of the reasons playing this game with a keyboard can be punishing. Combat is just terrible, you just smash the button and attack. Luckily there isn't many combat. I can understand why they decided to put it in game, but the implementation really is terrible.  In terms of story, it is really complex, cryptic and creepy at times (character design, especially the faces contribute to that level of 'creepyness'). Travelling through the two worlds, I found Stark to be more fun and interesting than Arcadia (this also happened to me for TLJ). After finishing the game you end up with hundreds of questions. The game story isn't closed and this can be frustrating.  Therefore, I can only recommend playing this game if you plan on playing Dreamfall: Chapters and you are interested in the story of these worlds (and wait for a sale ofc). If you liked TLJ only for the amazing point and click adventure game it was, you will be disappointed with Dreamfall.",

            "review_text": "Dreamfall: The Longest Journey is the story-rich game that falls between The Longest Journey and Dreamfall: Chapters. It relies most heavily on character development and storyline exposition through interactions with well-developed NPCs and only occasional puzzles. The emotive voice acting and variety of accents adds to the gameplay making it easier to bring the somewhat dated graphics back to life.   I would recommend playing The Longest Journey before starting the sequel or if the graphics are too off-putting, watching a playthrough online. There are occasional references to the first game which are much more satisfying when you have the background knowledge, of not just the overall plot, but of the specific events and characters.   Dreamfall: The Longest Journey is a story driven game rather than a true puzzle oriented, adventure game. As a result, it falls flat when it comes to the other, very few, gameplay aspects that were tacked on. For instance, your choices result in different dialogue but don't affect the overall storyline, the short combat sequences are poorly implemented, and the puzzles are few and far between.   Nevertheless, the storyline and character development are so well done, that the few instances where it falls flat are easily overlooked in order to find out what happens next and enthusiastically watch the story unfold.   The first and third installments are terrific and fall much more neatly into the puzzle focused, adventure genre than Dreamfall: The Longest Journey. However, don't sell this game short and enjoy it for what it is, which is an interactive, story-driven, and engaging link between two worlds.  ",

            "review_text": "Just finished this gem, and I will definetly need more time to let the ending 'sink in'. - Probably come back and take more time for this review.  But I need to write something down, and tbh I normally only spent time on writing book reviews. In fact, this game took me by surprise. I experienced something we do call a sophisticated walking simulator these days - a game with unrelevant gameplay mechanics. Fortunatelly it had parts which required to move in stealth - or let find a more sophisticated way to describe it - required to stay 'undetected'. So, if you want some envolved gameplay mechanics, you wont find any. As a matter of factly, I strongly suggest to play this game with a controller (does it work with the steam controller, TBH i dont care - it worked wonderfully with an old XBOX 360 controller - had just to remap 1 button) as I couldnt cope with the Mouse and Keyboard controls. The puzzles were easy - the combat was just awful. (There are alternative solutions to avoid most combat in the game).  So if not for the gameplay, why do play it at all? For the storytelling and the story, and If you have not played 'The Longest Journey - Funcom 1999' yet - play this rather classical point and click adventure first. In fact do it now. You will miss some meta-story elements which actually made Dreamfall - and its last chapters a blast for me. Oh, and besides that, handful characters and many locations from the first game had a comeback in Dreamfall.  And no, no synopsis and summary will do it - trust me on that. Some parts need time to sink in. Futhermore - the writing is superb and rather mature compared to other games out there. The voice acting is outstanding. Within the first chapters I'd say - TLJ 1999 had the better voice acting. But after finishing the game. my opinion changed drastically. I would say its different. I missed the sarcasm and humor of the first game. But some of it came back in Chapter 8 (with certain characters). And i am sure Ragnar Tornquist had his reasons to keep the theme a bit darker/serious.  Be warned - the ending is not for the faint of heart and the weak of mind. And there is a reason why so many people wanted a continuation in 'Dreamfall Chapters' (3rd game in the series)  Do your choices matter - some minor choices and decisions made in the chapters will have some minor impact on the story, but will not change the outcome or the plot on the meta level (unlike LiS or TWD Season 1)  Graphics: so this game was made in 2006 - I recently googled some of the 2006 Titles - back then this game was top notch - and I'd say, Dreamfall still looks acceptable today - it was rather awkward, because some the settings are astounding. You will travel between so many locations - and it will be impossible for you to guess what will come up next. The Characters are very well made - top notch lip-sync - eye movement etc. but the great character-art will feel awkward compared to these days facial animations - rather like blunt doll faces.  On a different level - compare this to KOTOR 2 - which was made in 2005, KOTOR 2 just looks awful compared to Dreamfall. Dreamfall runs with all modern 16:9/16:10 resolutions.  Sound: Great support for all kinds of Soundchips from back in the day, Dolby 7:1 worked fine. The Soundtrack is amazing. Everything here from modern lounge music to non synth classical tracks played by a real symphonic orchestra.  Will I like this game?  If you rather lack in patience - do not like long dialogues. Dislike games with mediocre gameplay mechanics: better stay away  If you need to feed your hunger for a unpredictalbe story written by of IMHO best writers in the gaming industry (Ragnar Tornquist). Want some outstanding voice acting - go for it.  Is it better than 'The Longest Journey'? Its different in many aspects. IMHO the pacing was better, but TLJ requires a lot more discipline to play, Especially if not using a walkthrough. (which is way more rewarding) Storywise - until chapter 8 I'd say TLJ any day, but after finishing the 2nd half of the game - I started to like both games for different reasons. If you have played and enjoyed TLJ (1999) - I'd say go for a playthrough of Dreamfall.  One final Warning - as already stated: the Ending is not everyones cup of tea - There are cliffhangers. As IMHO the story itself was mostly resolved - but the mystic metaplot kept my mind spinning (in a good way). Luckily Dreamfall Chapters are almost finished.",

            "review_text": "  This game was a bday prezie from a friend. I loved the first game which was a point and click so it was interesting to adjust to the different controls. Not bad but it changed the style of what I expected. The name 'The Longest Journey' is so relevant to what it is...which makes for an epic-like story which I find appealing. I liked how they introduced new protagonists but I feel they missed a good chance to complete the first games protagonist's story (April Ryan). You have to play to figure out what I mean... or just read about it online because I am not spoiling anything. ;-) The game had a lot more plot holes which makes me feel like the story is incomplete, so I hope Dreamfall Chapters will explain this more. Overall, I still highly recommend if you like story-rich games that blends sci-fi and fantasy as well as mystery and conspiracy...Which I def do.",
