The art style is great. The music is great.  My only critisism is that the game abruptly ends, taking you back to the first puzzle which leaves you wondering for a minute why the puzzles became so simple all of a sudden.",

This time you are matching lines on puzzle pieces to create a path by replacing one with another, sliding them or rotating them and in later levels sometimes all at once. To add complexity you can even rotate entire sides or even just parts of the sides. While the game never gets too complex, there is a level of difficulty in the last few puzzles that requires a bit of thought and planning.  The soundtrack is very soothing and the graphics great reminiscent of Zenge, not by this author, but without the overarching story.  I have no idea how many levels there were (50?, 60?), keeping with the minimalist theme there is no counter or selection scene, could have used one. The game ended when it wrapped around to the first level again. The game only took me about an hour, but for the very minimalist amount of less than one dollar, Klocki is a great little game worthy of your time.",

There were no words in the entire game so you have to figure out everything by yourself, but that adds to the novelty. It took me about an hour and a half to beat. Pros: •Very simple to understand. •Slowly introduces new concepts so you don’t have to try to memorize all the ideas at once. •Not frustratingly difficult, but it still makes you think. •Not at all expensive. •Tremendously fun! Cons: •No title screen or easy way to pick a specific level. •Too short. Overall: I thoroughly enjoyed the Klocki, and my mom says that she liked the few minutes she spent playing it. However, when I clicked to move to the next level and it went to the very first level I was a bit disappointed. But since the game was only $0.99 I should not be complaining. 9/10 ",

They are challenging, logical, and often times they are frustrating (in a great way) because the solution is always just right there in front of you. It's also $1 at full price.

However, the puzzle design is good, if not challenging - everything is fairly intuitive and well-presented - and the sound design is fitting, and as new mechanics were introduced an interested little 'ooh!' escaped me a couple of times. I would like to see some sort of interface for level selection or way of telling how far through you are - hell, I'm a junkie for Steam achievements so a little positive feedback would be good for me - but I think that my latter preferences are at odds with what the game actually offers - an almost aimless wander through a few relaxing puzzles, instead of rushing through to hit targets or complete the game or whatever other things I do which stop me from switching off and smelling the roses.  I'm not saying it will permanently change the way I play games, of course, but it is a nice experience.  Also, it's hella cheap.",

The best part is how these mechanics are first introduced to players. No rules, no prompts, no timers, just you and a puzzle. Touch an element and it immediately reacts to that stimuli.  I use Klocki as an example at the studio I work at to illustrate how simple a mechanic can be, yet be used so carefully that it becomes something amazing. ",

While some other levels get tricky and although you seem to know how to deal with it, it will confuse you.  When you think it is impossible to do it, you will actually see how to deal with the problem the other way around. This game has quite great level pool, so it takes some time to finish them all, but believe me, you will be satisfied when you're done with it.  Pros -Great game for the buck -Big level pull -Your brain actually need to work here -Great for kids to develop some skills Cons -No trading cards  Overall I will give this game 9/10 because, even though I really enjoyed it, I would like to see Steam Trading Cards.",

(So no risk of launching my mouse through my PC's monitor, which is always a plus).   The goal here is to move tiles around to make the required shapes, patterns and lines. This can be done by rotating, sliding or swapping tiles or multiples of tiles dependant on the puzzle. As of now (18th July) there aren't many levels to play through, but they do get increasingly difficult as you progress and there is a sense of achievement later in the game. There is no dialogue and there are no cut scenes, it's just an honest little puzzle game.

You must figure out how to connect all the appropriate pieces together and learn as you go to solve each level. Just like Targoni's first game, Hook, it is relaxing, but also a bit challenging.   I would highly recommend getting this game because you can get a substantial amount of time out of this game for the low price.   Minor gripes would be that there is a lack of trading cards, achievements, and numbered levels - which Targoni's previous game featured, but perhaps they will be later added.   Also Targoni listens to recommendations from reviewers; I have seen on Hook’s reviews that some people wanted a way to control the music on the game and Targoni has added a function to toggle the audio in Klocki.  If you’re not completely sold on these positive reviews, Targoni has kindly provided a demo version!  www.kongregate.com/games/targaciej/klocki   I hope to see more puzzle games from Maciej Targoni, I will surely support this game developer further.",

But this works exceptionally well , as the various mechanisms are presented to the player very naturally, making the player build an intuition on how the game works for themself, which, in my opinion, is the selling point of this game.  I thoroughly enjoyed playing each level, especially the later ones, involving several of the machanisms that have been introduced earlier.  I only hope the developers find the time to create more mechanisms and more difficult levels.",

The game starts with simple mechanics, but it gets more complicated along the way. At the same time it gets more interesting.   Personally, I beat the game in it's  current state  (4.10.2016) in 71 minutes.  It could have gone faster, but I took my time. The game is very soothing, yet challenging.  The game has around 30-ish puzzles, I'm not really sure. I hope there's more to come!  I'd rate this game a nice 9/10, since it could have been longer. The game is very well priced, and I'm pleased with my purchase.",

PLayed this one and was amazed and slightly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off due too the sliding puzzle...  Worst part is if you play it in one sitting you can get 73 minutes into the game and complete it. Maybe even less if you have the wit too do it.  I reccomend this game to people who like minimalistic puzzles and have an extra $0.99 to spare.",

Mostly amazing graphics (the type of things from the last level should be smoother when combined). This great rewarding inception sound. And great level-design based tutorialization, without obnoxious explicit arrows, animations and texts.  The main problem is — small levels, which are very easy, and there are not much of them. You can blitz the game in less than half of an hour. Well it costs slightly more than one loaf of bread (in our local pricing), and 30% of that money goes to the valve's pocket. By itself these several minutes of gameplay were worth the price. But if we consider the current meta, where you can buy for the same amount of money old full AAA release (or two) [like, for example, two great Commandos games], then this seems extremely expensive. Also it doesn't have an ending, just like in old arcades — if you won it instantly starts over without warning.  So, before purchase, you should estimate how much you like tile sliding\\switching\\rotating puzzlers and just how cheap are you.",
