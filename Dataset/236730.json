            "review_text": "Anomaly 2 is the sequel to the innovative 2011 Anomaly: Warzone Earth. It’s a reverse tower defense game or tower offense in which you protect the attackers and destroy the towers. The premise of the game is simple – alien machines have invaded and Earth is in ruins. You are the only hope to reach the titular anomaly and destroy them. Regrettably, Anomaly 2 has more story exposition than its predecessor which wouldn’t be a bad thing if it wasn’t very poorly written and voice acted. You have all sorts of terrible cliches including hillbilly marines, an elderly German scientist and a younger female doctor all with equally horrible accents. At least you can skip all the cutscenes.  Anomaly 2 is all about the gameplay and that’s where it shines. The player takes over the role of the Commander unit which is tasked to protect and guide the military unit convoy. You can choose your route on the fly and you can buy, sell and upgrade units at any time. The novelty in Anomaly 2 that provides a pretty big twist is that you can morph any of your units to suit the challenges of the current battlefield. For example, the armored vehicle with a long range gatling gun morphs into a robot with devastating short range flamethrowers. The morph mechanic does a great job at keeping you on your toes as different situations require different tactics.  Your convoy can only consist of up to six vehicles and you only have five unit types (ten if you count the morph ability). The enemy towers are more varied than that. Apart from the low level towers, there are also big boss towers which deal great amounts of damage, predator towers which only appear as you’re already passing through, hacker towers that form a disruption field in which your units will attack your Commander unit and so on. As the Commander, you have four different abilities – repair units, launch a decoy, target a selected enemy and disable enemy tower. All of these enemy towers and the morph and Commander abilities come together to create a a very dynamic and at times extremely intense experience.  The campaign goes on for 14 missions across a slightly disappointing variety of environments. The first half of the game takes you across a frozen United States mid-west and New York City whereas the other half you’ll be fighting through the jungles of South America and Rio de Janeiro. Even though each mission is different enough, it all kind of boils down to snow levels and jungle levels. It also feels too short, the game only starts to really get going and then pretty soon after that it’s over.  The graphics are great, both the friendly and enemy unit designs looks really good, the weather effects and the explosions look awesome. The soundtrack doesn’t really stand out, but the sound effects really heighten the intensity of the carnage even further.  Anomaly 2 successfully manages to carve out its own place in a rather saturated genre thanks to its new ideas and interesting tactical gameplay mechanics.  7 OUT OF 10 (VERY GOOD)",

            "review_text": "I didn't think I'd recommend any of the games in the Anomaly series but this one stood out among the rest. I only played the single-player campaign so that's what this review is based on. With that said, the story of the game definitely has a much broader feel compared to the previous ones as it takes place across three continents as humanity struggles against the machines for survival and a better tomorrow. It also has two endings which are determined by your decision in the final mission.  The gameplay, units and towers are pretty much the same as the previous games with one difference: each unit can transform which repurposes it for a completely different function, so the amount of different units is essentially expanded to 10, each of the five purchasable units can be switched to its counterpart by simply double-clicking it at will on the battlefield. Still, the game is fairly simple and has four difficulty modes that can be chosen before the beginning of each mission.  Again, I recommend this one over the others and perhaps the only reason to play the others is for what little storyline they have leading up to this one but it can still stand by itself because the opening cinematic can get the player up to speed on how Earth was thrown into a perpetual Winter. So I suppose it's safe to ignore the others and only play this one!",

You're trying to stop them. No major issues here, as far as i'm concerned.  I don't really feel that the general gameplay is any better in this sequel than in the original. Yeah, there are some new enemy types and so on, but for some reason it just feels as if this game is less interesting than the original. It doesn't really add enough new mechanics.  One of the things that really annoys me with this game is the fact that there is no controller support. There was support for it in Anomaly: WE, but not here. It makes no sense that this would be the case.  The graphics and sound are pretty good, as they were in the original game. Can't complain there.  This game does have enhanced multiplayer support, so I suppose if that's what you're after you could get this game. But I haven't tried it so can't comment on it.  All in all, don't buy this game just because you liked the original. I don't really think it adds much to the experience.",

Guided by an evolving tutorial, until you're suddenly really in trouble.  I had enough fun with the mechanics in this one. Easy to learn and good to feel in control of all aspects of the missions - Where will special skills be used and exactly when, what route your convoy will take through the enemies, what mode each of your vehicles will be for what situation, what order they will be in, buy more? etc. Even the little things - Will you distract turrets and make them turn towards the vulnerable commander (you!) so they have to take time turning back towards your convoy pummeling them, or just use one of those special skills you might need later. This game also looks pretty nice! Lotsa explosions and pretty shiny effects everywheree.

After searching for an opponent at different times of the day and continouosly failing to find even a single person to play against... I had to quit. I really wish there was an online player base, because I feel like the multiplayer would be so awesome.

Mutiplayer meanhwile is neat, but you'll have a hard time finding anybody to play with, and most people are rather bad at it, since, as I said, it's difficult to find someone to practice with in the first place.

Its not often I find a game that can make me so mad I storm off to cool down just to come right back an hour later to try again. I love how it gets your full attention right from the start.  The biggest thing to get used to in this game is the low amount of units you think you have to choose from. I cannot tell you how many times I forget I can morf my units. This single twist has not only made the depth of play greater it has made your tactics a more thought out part of the game. No longer can you just pick the op final unit and just roll over everything. I tried and you can still die even on the normal diff setting. You will learn to use the morf so much that your scouting ahead looking for the location you will morf each unit based on the enemies you will face. Great job devs.",
