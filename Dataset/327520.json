            "review_text": "This game has a great personality creating a wonderful experience as you Traverse through the dark but yet vibrant world of Brimstone. The game offers an eclectic mix of intelligent puzzles that forces you to think outside the box while having a blast with your gravity glove.   As you progress throughout the game you find funny and rather crazy objects that offers the possibilities to goof around, and it will undoubtedly make you crack up and smile like the kid you are.   Traverser is to me a great game that offers a lot of fun combined with the right amount of intelligence. I strongly recommend this game, 10/10 and would love to see a sequel!    Strongly Recommended!",
