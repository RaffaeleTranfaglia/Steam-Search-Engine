Your team has no common sense so they don't shoot an enemy that runs by them and then he turns and shoots your team in the back. Your team has horrible accuracy, moves slower than old people f*ck, reacts slower than i drop a deuce, and is dumber than a fake boob. This game has better graphics than the first game, better chatter between the team, and a better command system but is not nearly as good.  Replayability: 1/10 Graphics: 7/10 Playablity: 3/10 Fun: 2/10 Time Spent Retrying Stupid Parts: 10/10",

            "review_text": "One of the few, if not one of the only, squad command games. Unlike most 'squad' games playing this game is not having an FPS role with useless NPC companions attached to you like those found Rainbow Six: Vegas or Call Of Duty (series). Here the squad is you; you have no direct control of firing &amp; the AI on the squad is basic but very effective; it fits the style of combat as the enemy AI is the same AI. Your controls are pretty much where to move &amp; which way to fire. And it works. It work very well. I haven't found any games where controlling the squad is the point not just there to make you feel as you're 'part of the team'. I think the closest I've come is 'Door Kickers'; a 2D over view game... which while a good game in it's own right... is not the same type of game. Reviews or suggestions that indicate games like ARMA or Mass Effect are similar have it completely wrong. I would be very happy in pre-ordering a modern remake of FSW:TH as it's one of the best military strategy games available. 9/10 because: a) it's aged well b) it's near one of a kind c) it's significantly refined over the first FSW d) Maintains a fairly accurate depiction of military tactics (i.e. combat carry of firearms etc.) e) looses a point because THQ were ♥♥♥♥♥ &amp; refused to fix a bug that can delete your saved game randomly ",
