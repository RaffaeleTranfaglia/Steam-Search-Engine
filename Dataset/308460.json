            "review_text": "This is a decent game with good physics.   + Turret First Person View + Good level design + Tower attacks get blocked my obstacles like tree.  - You can place towers only on certain pre-decided spots.  - Too much restrictions, no freedom. - Only a few 'Good' combinations to place your towers. - Very few towers - Slow waves/levels (yeah, even on 3x Speed, the game was pretty slow to me)   I usually love TD's but this specific one is probably designed as a 'CASUAL' game. It just felt like a lot of hand holding. You can't decide your own place to build a tower. There are pre-designated spots from which you must chose. Among those there is only a few good combinations to place towers, if you don't place the specific tower on the specific slot the developer inteded you to put, You will most likely lose the level.   It's a decent game to chillax, but NO-NO for a hardcore Tower Defense fan.",

While it is a fun game it's also limited with a few tower types and levels. Only a few hours of fun.. but the camera rotation option surely gives the game a plus..",

One of my favorite things about tower defense is the upgrades. This is too simple though. Half way through the level I had filled up all spots and upgraded to  the max on everything (Level 3). Nothing happens when you upgrade. No visual changes or anything. They give a little more damage but that seems to be it. I then just had to sit there and wait for the waves to come and be destroyed so the level could be completed. Maybe the  game gets better later on, but I could not bring myself to click 'Next' to endure another round  of nothing fun or exciting.",

The difficulty increases with every level and I must admit it starts to be very challenging at some point.   The graphics looks like everything was a paper model. It is really nice and well done. That's what made me to play this game at the first place.  And I don't regret, I had a really good time with it.",

            "review_text": "On the one hand, this game feels like someone's first game, perhaps a good student project. On the other hand, it's still fun!  The graphics are very simple, but it still has a certain cute appeal. If nothing else, it's distinctive. The tower AI is immensely stupid. You  will  yell curses at your towers, and wonder if they're manned through some sort of outreach program for special kids. But the levels are balanced for the towers as they are, and you can somewhat compensate by tower placement.  There's nothing really original here, just your basic tower defense game, and I wouldn't pay full price for it, but I still liked it, and if you're not totally burned out on tower defense it's worth $5 IMO. It hasn't crashed once on me, no bugs or gliches that I've seen, and for the most part the levels are balanced well (level 9 has issues).  [Note: this is the same game as Tabletop Defense, apparantly some issue between the devs and the first publisher, but the devs claim they get money when you buy this one and they don't from that one, for whatever that's worth.]",
