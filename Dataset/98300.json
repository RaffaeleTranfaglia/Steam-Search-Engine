After that it gets quite challenging. Which is good, it is really tense. The game has a very impressive arsnel ranging from vickers machine guns to 18 pounders etc. The graphics are not the best in what u expect in a stragetic RTS and men of war defeinatly beats it, however it fits the game. Its not an extremly realistic game that will die of bordom after about an hour , its challenges keeks you playing until you win. Probobly the only thing the realy matters in this game is 1 thing, There is no Multiplayer or Co-op missions which really matters at high lvls. Like 2 objectives to defend with swarms and swarms of enemies at both objectives as seen in mission ten, some missions are almost impossible to complete but you keep on going to achieve victory. This is a very fun game with alot of potential. I would highly reccomend buying it. As updates go by multiplayer may be added so over time certain parts may become false and out of date, as for now thats about it. This game is well worth buying for people new to stragery and RTS games.   From me 8/10   Sweep ",

            "review_text": "Bombs whistle overhead, exploding into hot pieces of plastic that rain down upon the young boys and old men hiding in the french soil below. Broken barbed wire, shattered wood and dead lifeless plastic scatter the land, with the distinct sound of airplane engines roaring up in the grey skies. Machine gun fire snuffs out the cries and moans of mutilated plastic. Then megatron crushes the laser ship that the french had, and if you thought that wasen't enough, a giant dog 50 times the size of any man comes crashing down, chewing up soldiers like they were beef jerky. This is the First World War.. kinda.  You play with plastic sets of Signal toys to wage war with your imagination. (like so many of us did back when we were young) Allied forces fight against the Germans in famous battlefields, with seriousness and sillyness mixed together to take the edge off while also keeping you interested.   It's set up as if you are a child playing with a friend or by yourself, playing out battles with plastic soldiers and tanks. I use to love doing this when I was a child, making the sounds with your mouth and using your hands to simulate explosions.   You mostly defend using stationary towers. You sometimes have to attack positions to take new locations. You can only place certain towers in certain areas and money is required to buy, repair and upgrade each enplacement. Money is earned by destroying units, placements and getting combo kills on units. Larger zones allow for flak to take care of those pesky planes and blimps and artillery to destroy vehicles or large groups of infantry. Machine guns, mortars and gas are the 3 smaller enplacements and they are deal with more of the smaller and weaker enemies like infantry, calvary and rifleman. All of these towers can be upgraded 3 times, each time giving them different statistics, good and bad. Each level will give you options on what and how to build to complete the job at hand.  On certain missions, you also get to use different vehicles, like two different tanks, one with gas and a cannon and the other with flamethrowers and a cannon. Two different planes are also given to you: a fighter with machine guns and limited bombs and a bomber with smaller machine guns but unlimited bombs that regenerate over time. All these vehicles can be destroyed or left and will respawn after a short delay. A sniper tower is also usually there, allowing you to take our enemies before your towers even have range.  There are 12 levels with several different difficulties, each increasing the health, damage and amount of enemies on the battlefield. After completing a level, you will be giving a score and rank according to how well you played during the mission. This is determined with how much money you had at the end of the level, how much time you saved during rounds and the difficulty you played on. There is also a side mission in each level, that gives you a ration item which appears in the showcase. These can be completed by finishing the requirements (like getting a 25x combo with explosives)  A survival mode is also present for when your done the campaign or just taking a break between levels. It allows you to see how long you can survive waves of enemies before you are overrun.  About 10 hours of gameplay between survival, campaign and achievement hunting. Unless you are okay with replaying the same levels with different play styles, there isn't a ton of replayability, but it really worth the time and money.  Personal Rating: 4.5/5",

The rule is simple protect your toy box against atacks of planes, soldiers, tanks, big bosses and others nasty things with MGs, cannons, aa guns etc. which you can buy and upgrade. You can take direct control over your 'turrent' or if its boring for you on some maps you can control tank, sniper or planes. This all gives a lot of fun, driving over enemy wave of infantry with tank, making kamikaze atack with plane. If you look for a challenge there is 'do it all by yourself' (literally) mode where turrents wont make a shoot without your direct control.  Bonus: When you see 40 toy soldiers killed by 1 upgraded cannon shot, more killed by MG and last of them finished by flames or chemical weapon you realised how World War 1 soldiers lifes was ♥♥♥♥ed.",

If you dont use your money wisely and place your weapons correctly, you are screwed. However it is also tremendously fun and can get a real laugh out of me , like when a heavy shell blasts guys hundreds of feet in the air. The variety of weapons and differeant kinds of destruction they deal out is great. mIt is also fun to get into the weapons and deal out the punishment yourself. I hope they will add new content to it soon. This game is a blast for New or Old Guard Gamers. Buy It and Enjoy !",

For this idea except that they can shoot from land, it is really great, and finally you really can not get bored of the game Tower Defense.

            "review_text": "When one speaks of the first World War, it simply comes to peoples minds of heavy usage of trenches that streatched for miles. For some history buffs and on lookers, they would think the same, but they would also know the more in depth fact that millions of lives were lost from the half a square mile between the trenches, or in other various locations around the globe. And lastly but ultimately, generals on all sides treating their army as if they were toy soldiers. My point being: nearly all generals thought that every citizen in their home country would be so infurated with national pride that thered be an exspendable, almost endless supply of recuirts.   Unfortunately, this caused the deaths of nearly 11 million people.   Anyway, this isnt a history lesson. That was just a little historical review of the games appropriate setting for that era.  Normally when you think of someone making a WW1 game itd be, needless to say, boring since the whole thing was a stalemate and that it was, but engagements went on for nearly weeks upon months. In Toy Soldiers, the battles that are chosen for each level are very accurately selected, and even the historical date and location and even some promises made by some generals who were there. but if you thik youll be waiting for 20 minutes at a time for something interesting to happen, youll find yourself proven wrong. The levels, in the least to say, get very epic at times, not only in scale but to the point where your brain is operating to manage all the incoming enemy waves. And trust me, theres not jsut simpel infantry and occasional tanks, there are several kinds of Infantry, Armored, Airborne, even bosses that are sometimes extrodianarily hard to defeat and each havign a unique look and style.  Your mission, is simply to defend your trench *cough cough* Toybox *cough* from these waves. Even at your desposal are several kinds of Machine guns, AA guns, anti infantry guns, and even occasionaly player controled offencive-defencive airborne and armor units of your own. And the really exciting part is that each can be upgraded to better defend yourself, and it quickly becomes somewhat of a mian side priority next to defeating the enemy.   Since i want to wrap this up in seperate sections so i dont make you lost, ill say the final conclusion setences:  1st: Toy Soldiers is a simple game. its setting, objectives, and graphics are respectable but this game isnt really striding to become the top game of tower defence or what you have since it really dosnt feel liek tower defence all the time.  2nd: If you love the feeling you get when you play a game and get this really sensational 'buzz' or 'drive' to get your brain operating fast and your attentions faster, this IS the game for you.   3rd: I have to add this part so you dont feel that the games soundtrack is on a loop; the games themes are randomly picked everytime you go to the menu. And unfortunately, theres only 3. But all quite good to say the least. Not everybody loves vinatge music from the early radio or record player era but i certianly do. So if your into pre, post, WW1 music, or anything between 1914 and 1939, you wouldnt mind this too much at all.   4th: I cant really say anything for the multiplay since it never really felt satisfying. its cool to play Offencive Defencive but it seemed a bit alien. if it was faster paced, id give it a good word but its not really to my liking unfortunately. All in All, im in nuetral stance for its Multiplayer mode, and its more up to you as far as what you feel towards it.  So if you wanna pass the time a bit, Toy Soldiers, is definately a game worth the money.   PS: i wont be leaving a review for Toy Soldiers: Cold War mostly for the fact that it kinda takes an odd turn down a GI Joeish world. And after playing it during the WW1 struggle, it really dosnt feel cool to jump to the 1950s through 70's. World War One is kinda my only perf for it. Howver, i would LOVE to see a coastal defence expansion, or a more broad spectrum as afar as fronts around the world. it would add so much more to the devine scale of the First World War.   ",

I especially like the Aecade-like elements, in which you can not only control your different 'towers' and expand their rach, but also take over the role of tanks or airplanes and therby gain the upper hand on the battlefield.  Music and atmosphere are matching the setting in an exellent way! For under 10€ you should give it a try, if it's on Sale for 5€ or less don't hesitate!",
