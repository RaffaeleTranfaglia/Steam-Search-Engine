You'll be avoiding spikes, and wandering enemies which you can jump on Mario-style. I knocked over the first 40 levels in 77 minutes, so this isn't a very long game. The author says he is working on a new chapter. I probably wouldn't pay full price for this, but I got it in an indie bundle, for which it is perfect. Looking forward to the new levels.",

            "review_text": "Game is nice visualy but it's only 40 short and mostly easy (except few) levels lasting ~1 hour of play. Some are pretty interesting, some annoying but there are a lot of almost empty ones which seems lazy. Level music overlaps with menu music on the level select screen. And what is worst of all in my opinion - steam page claims the game has cards but it doesn't, there is no such badge. We all know games with cards sells better and I guess that was the dev's plan. I was waiting with my thumbs down thinking maybe he is going to add cards later, but two month after the release it's still not present. For smaller price and with cards I guess I could recommend this game, but now I don't.",
