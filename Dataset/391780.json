            "review_text": "Pros: - One of the probably best settings menu for the user I've ever seen, so I don't need to be looking at the appdata/my document folders to change stuff I want - Editor, with ability to do a lot of stuff - Ability to host your server with your own map, and join freely those servers - Tons of options loaded in the game (Music Player, Record player)  Cons/Feedback: - No Crosshair visible for the 3rd person mode - Netplay, feels very laggy tho I wasn't able to connect european server I guess (only american and asian probably judging by ping over 100ms )... It also might be the thing with the default settings for the netplay so I guess it's hard to say for me, - Performance -&gt; when shooting smoke tends to make the gameplay stutter, which is very bad for the FPS game where you look for rather smooth gameplay, - Lack of diversity in weapons -&gt; While you have ability to change terrain on which you play, there are only 3 weapons - Gun,Rifle and Mine... it lacks melee attack which is in every game of this genre, - Animation doesn't seem like matching between 3rd and 1st person mode while running, - UI needs some polish... It feels like it was pretty much template and it stayed that way, Feels kinda same with background screen being the sky with stars but no object where player can keep his eyes on, I feel like putting the big Ubergame text in the middle instead of lower left corner would make it look better,  - Offline Documentation view for torque doesn't seem to work - default input settings seems to be strange, specifically : Throw button (alt g), 1st/3rd Person Switch mode (f3), no input settings for the weapons on numbers (even to you're able to change them by using '1','2','3') - using '3' (which I guess was supposed to be mine weapon?) at the start of the game instead of mine makes me see the assault rifle model weapon with ammo of 1/0 which I can't use. I guess I shouldn't be able even to do that. '0' makes me dequip any weapon I had - You could add FPS in general settings for the game (to make it easier to see if you have enough fps and not be troubled by using the hotkeys for the casual players to see if they're playing with smooth FPS   As a player I can't really recommend this game (at least yet), but as a Volunteer project I guess it's still pretty good stuff seeing that it's probably closer alpha rather than beta.",

This game is just another peice of garbage that waste's your time. DO NOT GET THIS GAME!   p.s I know this is an early stage game and there is only 1 developer, but look at Unturned. It is a much better game from only 1 developer.",

The game itself is not bad for a free project but in my opinion it's really just a game where you just boot it up to screw around in. Since it is a free project you don't lose out on anything (maybe except time lol).  There's some sort of glitch that happened when I set this game to the lowest resolution and the game didn't work for me anymore. This happened a few months ago and I stopped playing it. Probably won't play this since I'm playing much better games, even on my crappy non-gaming laptop.",

To the developer i can only say once you have a guide to the editor and more importing options this project can only grow.  (edit:) Side note: once a melee element is made this game will boom from the current love of the darkage books and the like given the effect on the world you can use. Swords at dusk...in a sand storm....epic..  To anyone under the age of 20: you will not like this and if your not skilled enough to make things of this sort you will not find it fun. This is a real full hearted throw back to the good old days of basics and the beauty there in. Go back to your HD-soaked ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t FPS's kiddos.  Looking forword to the future of this game and hope that this review will bring in the few people who recall what made a good game and thats: Hard Work, Imagination, A drive to want something awesome!",

            "review_text": "(English) Shooter with the modest name Uebergame (Sverige that is).  Whether the German developers awesome irony, or outrageous delusions of grandeur. - in the game the whole 3 of them! Gun, machine gun, grenade launcher on it, mines. All. This is the army, son. - game in a SINGLE mode! Deathmatch. Say even in the first Duma modes? Not heard. - in the game as much as a few pieces of cards made using the same template - ruins\\buildings\\bunkers in the center, and the endless desert\\forest sides. Moreover, there are breaks in the level, Hello Flat world of Terry Pratchett! - in the game there is no choice of character skins. But you can change the color for example on the fashionable blue tint, and you can also put the mode of 3 persons, with terribly jerky and curve animation. - the game has a map editor, though, who needs all the 'pros' of this game. - the game has no official servers. And almost no players, although who is going to play?  Going to the site. you can see the tremendous library of free textures, sounds and all. That's apparently developed and decided in my spare time to make this kind of LEGO. But, as his hands are splayed, turned that piece of ♥♥♥♥. And by the way who do not understand-in this review do not dash, and not even a minus. 1/10  (Русский) Шутер со скромным Uebergame имя (Свериге это).  Будут ли немецкие разработчики удивительной иронией, или возмутительно манией величия. - в игре всего 3 из них! Пистолет, пулемет, гранатомет на нем, шахты. Все. Это армия, сынок. - игры в одиночном режиме! Дефматч. Говорят, даже в первом режимов Думы? Не слышал. - в игре аж несколько штук карт, сделанных по одному шаблону - руины\\зданий\\бункеры в центре, и бесконечная пустыня\\лес по бокам. Кроме того, есть разрывы в уровне Привет 'плоский мир' Терри Пратчетта! - в игре нет выбора персонажа. Но вы можете изменить цвет, например на модный синий оттенок, и вы можете также поставить режим из 3-х человек, с жутко дерганная и кривая анимация. - в игре есть редактор карт, хотя, кому нужны все 'плюсы' этой игры. - в игре нет официальных серверах. И почти нет игроков, хотя кто будет играть?  Зайдя на сайт. вы можете увидеть огромную библиотеку бесплатных текстур, звуков и все. Вот видимо разрабы и решили в свободное время, чтобы сделать этот вид Лего. Но, так как руки кривоваты, оказалось что кусок ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥а. И кстати, кто не понял-в этом обзоре не тире, и даже не минус. 1/10",
