The problem that plague this otherwise very good party game is multiplayer optimization and sychonization. Even if you play a local game you still suffer from uncontrolable lags from time to time.  For a multiplayer game that really killed it for me and remove all the fun and that's why all the game server are all empty all the time.  On the flip side. Just play an hour and you can gift a key to your friend for free.. Yes.. a Fully functional game key.  4/10.. fix the lag issue and this game instantly became a 7 in score...",

The games I played were mostly different from the ones in the vid, maybe there was more to come, not sure, but it could have been more fun, hard to pick out which player is yours too(sometimes you don't figure it out until you are defeated)  The idea is neat, I want to like this, it is close to being worthwhile....but any full release game that can't last for more than 20 minutes without freezing is going to be a refund, unless the game is great....and this wasn't",
