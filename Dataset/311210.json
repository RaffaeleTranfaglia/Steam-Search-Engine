            "review_text": "Context: I've been playing Call of Duty since World at War, though I skipped Advanced Warfare for lack of a platform to play it on, I considered myself done with the franchise anyway after the games began to lost their spark. So, when I built my own PC I couldn't really resist the chance to play another Treyarch Zombies experience. So, here's a little on the game modes. My lack of experience with Advanced Warfare means this is my first installment with the new mobility options, bear that in mind.  Campaign: Maybe it's because I'm getting older, but by god this was the worst story I've played so far. Black Ops 1 and 2 had a story that tied together classical war gameplay with sci fi elements in a subtle way that always made the big campaigns plot twist a surprise. This time, the ending is almost blatantly laid out in front of you from the moment you beat the third mission, assuming you're paying attention. I'm not sure what the message they're trying to get across in this game is, but it's a wholy unsatisfying experience, and by the 6th mission I was turning the difficulty down to recruit just so I could slog through the boring levels and make it to the end.   You're not fighting a war, because it's never really explained who you're fighting for, the game is one big game of 'Chase Paul Taylor around the world' and by World I mean Singapore and Egypt. Level diversity isn't present here, and level design, while obviously catered to the 'new' movement mechanics, isn't fleshed out further than the occasional few balconies in a room to add faux verticality. The campaign crutches on the movement mechanics as its interesting gimmick to keep it fresh, but it doesn't really work as well as things such as vehicular combat in the previous games, no matter how linear. The weird robot superpowers you get are all somewhat useless too, as they're just 'Point at person, make them stop shooting you for a bit of time' Which seems a bit useless when you can just shoot them instead, or use the only decent ability to release killer flaming bees to clear a room. The Campaign is needlessly padded with customisation to add this illusion of content, when it's easier to just use the preset loadouts for each level.  A boring experience with no payoff, bland characters and far too linear shooting. Playing this made me want to play Black Ops 1. The main problem I find with these overly futuristic installments is that they're not believable enough to immerse yourself in, and atmosphere is completely non existant. I hope they finally ditch this future ♥♥♥♥, it's been 4 years. Take me back to World War 2 already.  Zombies: I played about 4 games of the new map before putting it down for good. The whole easter egg thing was nice at first, giving you an extra objective and a way to get a few extras, like maybe all the perks on the map, but this is ♥♥♥♥ing absurd. You have to jump through far too many hoops just to get basic features, and it's just a huge chore, honestly. You pretty much have to do it as well, unless you want all your guns to be worthless by round 15. Once again, they compromised level design in favour of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly complicated story ♥♥♥♥. Not to mention the bland cast of literal whos voiced by expensive actors, throwing back to Call and Mob of the Dead, but I never liked those ones anyway. Kind of annoys me that this garbage is the only map available unless you own The Giant, which is still the best map, or unless you bought the season pass.  It's pulled an Assassins Creed whereby they started tuning an overarching story into it but let it get too complicated and just ditched it, I've lost track of everything at this point. The worst part, as mentioned, is that they ruin the actual gameplay to make way for boring scavenger hunts. Shadows of Evil is boring to play, tedious and poorly designed. I haven't played a map as bad as this since Shangri-La.   The Giant, a reskin of Der Reise, still stands the test of time, however. The new visuals make this look absolutely gorgeous, and stands to remind me just how old this franchise is at this point. The map has not changed whatsoever, besides randomisation of perk locations and a few small easter eggs (That don't take forever to do!) The mechanic of Pack-A-Punching your weapon twice was introduced in the first Black Ops and added generic attatchments to your weapon, but now they add interesting mechanics to your guns, allowing zombies to explode into fireworks that damage other zombies in an AOE, for example. Finally, the Gobblegum machine is easily the best addition to the game mode since the introduction of the Pack a Punch in the original Der Reise. A fantastic way to add small power ups that are consumable. Extremely powerful ones, such as spawning an ammo box on command, are gated behind a drop system, which reeks of a microtransaction system that was probably removed at the last second. As usual, I'll be waiting for the rest of the maps to release before passing my final judgement, but if you're going to buy the base game and that alone for a taste of modern Zombies, then you'll be disappointed.  Multiplayer: And I thought League of Legends had mobility creep, yet here we are. There are now about 1000 new ways to avoid getting shot, which is actually pretty nice, because it adds far more depth to the dueling aspect of meeting someone in the middle of an open area. Sliding, Jumping, Wall-running all add to a rather refreshing way to play the game. I'll stand by the statement that this mechanic was a fantastic addition to the game.  In terms of balance, it feels like they've gone for the MW2 approach, whereby 'If everything is disgustingly OP, then nothing is!' which isn't actually a bad thing. SMG's are still far too powerful, sniper rifles will always be the bane of my existence, and for once the shotguns aren't garbage. Melee has been replaced with weapon butting which is no longer an instant kill, which I feel makes sense with all the new ways to fly at your opponent at light speed. However, you can still equip a knife as a secondary which kills instantly, leading to a lot of knife only players. Maps are well designed around movement, but other than that they're pretty weak. None of them are fun or satisfying to play, and the classic spawn flipping is still as frustrating as ever. All the maps are medium sized, and there's no real diversity like back in MW2 where you had huge maps and tiny ones. Nothing is unique, it's all grey again and devoid of colour, which sorely disappointed me.  However, as usual Multiplayer is ♥♥♥♥ing overflowing with content, and it's easy to justify the price tag on this game when you see what ♥♥♥♥ like Battlefront gets away with charging £40 for. There's loads to unlock, accomplish and use. Every game you get like 5 new shiny rewards to skinner box you into playing more, yet there's still no real reason to prestige. This amount of content makes the game feel 'worth it' in the same way a £50 box of 50 sweets is worth it, but you'll get bored of the same sweet eventually.  Conclusion: If you've never liked Call of Duty, this game won't do anything to change that. Couple the *complete* lack of innovation in this installment with the abysmally small PC playerbase and uninspired themes I feel like this is one of the weakest Call of Duty games ever. And I enjoyed Ghosts. In its current state, I find it hard to reccomend as what you get is a lot of content, but it's all frustrating and ultimately worthless. The running joke has always been that 'Call of Duty is always the same' but this is no more obvious than in this installment. Feels like a mediocre side-grade of Advanced Warfare.   If you're reading reviews for a COD game, you're not the primary market. Don't buy this.  Also, do me a favour and don't comment below, my inbox is filling and I don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about what you have to say.",

            "review_text": "It is quite late for me to be making a review for this game, but better late than never.  Black Ops III is a very solid Call of Duty game. The best one yet in recent years, if I do say so myself. Content-wise, this game has enough stuff to keep you busy for a long, long time. And I'm going to tell you why:  1. CAMPAIGN: True to Treyarch fashion, the campaign is a complete mind♥♥♥♥. You thought you understood it, but then BOOM! It hits you with a plot twist so deep, M. Night Shyamalan couldn't even comprehend. The amount of lore and detail that went into this game is unbelievable by COD standards. That said, the campaign doesn't come without flaws. The story and characters have some poor design, with a lot of characters that you are supposed to care for, yet the game didn't attempt to make you feel it and just assume you do. You feel disconnected at times from the story, even though that's probably a good thing as you're supposed to be (I can't say any further because that will spoil the story). The campaign doesn't feature a lot of familiar actors, but going along with more cult favorites such as Christopher Meloni, Katee Sackhoff and Ben Browder, who maybe more familiar to those who are fans of series like Law and Order, Battlestar Galactica and Stargate SG-1. For the most parts, the actors did a good job in their portrayal of the characters, which is to be expected. My only concern is the lack of identity for the Player character, which, again, fits with the plot that Treyarch is trying to portray. But a last name like 'Mason' would've sufficed.  Gameplay-wise, this is the most in-depth COD campaign yet, with full level progression for your character, guns and equipment, with a variety of unlocks. To truly acquire 100% completion in this campaign can take you a serious amount of time. But it's worth every single second for those who love a good challenge. And you can even play the campaign co-op with up to 4 players, so the experience is even more fun.  2. MULTIPLAYER: If you love Black Ops II MP, and you love advanced movements, you'll love Black Ops III MP. The chain-based movement system made by Treyarch is very fluid and easy to master, in comparison to the Exo system provided by Sledgehammer Games in Advanced Warfare. Players have better control of the movement, which makes for a more relaxing experience (in theory). The Specialists are a very nice addition, though unbalanced at times for the game. It's very surprising to see Treyarch build an entire lore and backstories for each Specialist, giving them their own identity rather than Random Soldier #76 (winkwink).  But of course, this game is also the start of the money-making train called 'COD Points'. By now, you should probably know about this microtransaction currency, which you use to buy supply drops in-game to open for a chance of good loot. It doesn't sound too bad, until they start adding weapons into the loot pool. Pretty much every new gun and melee weapon are locked behind supply drops. So if you're unlucky, you may never see a new weapon in your time of playing this game. However, don't be too discouraged, as the game does have a Contract challenge that will provide you with supply drops that guarantee at least one gun and one melee weapon (and one more for each when you buy the season pass).  The DLC maps are also well done, with old maps being remade to fit the movement system. Definitely worth picking up the season pass for. As of now, the DLC maps are sadly only in TDM, but I hope in the future Treyarch will compose a Moshpit playlist for all objective modes, so that season pass owners can play objective modes on the DLC maps.  3. ZOMBIES: The heart of Treyarch's games, Zombies is even more in-depth than ever before. The story is given way more attention this year, with cinematic moments that you'd only dream of in the campaign, while retaining the mystery and crypticness of Treyarch all around it. It was such a pleasure to see how Zombies developed from a simple survival game mode to the complex, easter egg-centric, cinematic mode that it is today. It was also pleasant to see the return of the favorite quartet of Zombies, the Original 4. as the main characters, kicking ♥♥♥ and saving the world. However, it does irk me that the game isn't as Zombie-focused as it should be. With the introduction of mythical forces in the story, the zombies become less and less important as the story progresses. It's not entirely a bad thing, but it can have a negative effect on the state of the story as a whole, a gamemode where originally zombies only existed due to a mysterious alien element.  Gameplay-wise, Zombies in Black Ops III provides a lot of variety, with special abilities called Gobblegums that you can use, as well as full weapon progression system. The maps are also well designed, as are the sidequests. That is, until the last two maps where the sidequests become random as all Hell. But all in all, it was a fun, exciting and epic journey. Even though the finale to the 8-year saga could've ended on a better note, it was satisfying for me. And I await to see what Treyarch cooks up in 2018.  4. PC VERSION: Despite what you may have heard, Black Ops III is actually quite optimized on PC. It's just a bit more demanding than other COD games, even Infinite Warfare, due to some design decisions. As with previous titles, Treyarch pays a lot of attention in giving PC gamers a good experience while not straying too far from the console experience. Though there are certain things I don't necessarily agree with on their work (like completely separating PC balancing from console), BO3 is still a solid PC game that deserves to be played. As of the time this review goes live, mod tools have already been out for over a month, and the community has published a lot of great content. If you loved custom Zombies in World at War, you'll love custom Zombies in BO3.  Overall, Treyarch didn't disappoint me with BO3. It was everything I expected it to be, and more. Did it come up short at certain parts? Yes. But the goods outweigh the bads for me. Black Ops III will remain one of my top 5 favorite COD games in a long time.",

Just opening the game you can see issues like Frame Stutters, Almost No Online Players, And The Fact It Takes 10 Minutes Some Times To Join A Server. They also make sure to make it very difficult to get anything good basically shoving it in your face to buy more crypto keys. (And i will be honest i have put almost $40 into crypto keys) But I cant get over the fact that the servers are so bad. Less then 1 percent of players are on the DLC that i payed for really?!? And me and my friends have had such crazy issues with the NAT type and having a party for multiplayer. If you are absoulutely set on buying this game DO NOT BUY THE DLC!

You are aided by a female demigod to kill her demigod-brother, sounds familiar? :3 -may be this is how they compensate the blend main story, they add zombies and a lots of dialogs between your character and two other 'voices'.

If you can't even play a game properly due to technical issues, it can be pretty frustrating. But the game itself is pretty fun. Zombie mode is fun, but weirdly complicated. Something that would be enjoyable to figure out with friends. The multiplayer is standard CoD fare. You should know by now if that's your cup of tea. Campaign is fairly enjoyable. I do recommend this game, but it kind of depends on what you are looking for in a game. If you really just want to shoot people in a game with well done fluid controls, this game is great.

I've earned every achievement in this game and I enjoyed the experience.  Multiplayer: - New movement mechanics that benefit run and gun, even melee playstyles that quickens the pace of the game. Is it bad? No. Is it different? Yes, hence many people who have played previous FPSs and had become accustomed to a slower pace can't immediately adapt and thus think the mechanic itself is poor. - While some weapons overall outclass others, this is the case for almost any game where you can customize loadouts, even TF2. Some weapons are more well rounded than others, like the VMP, while some suit a niche playstyle, like the Razorback, which is useful by keeping distance outside of the effective range of the VMP. You connect the dots. - Black Market weapons are not broken. None of the weapons that come from them hold a pristine advantage over the default selection of weapons. The only gripe with a Black Market weapon I have is the Shadowclaw because of the Bayonet attachment. It has a larger lunge range than any other melee in the game and thus render melee weapons like the nunchucks obsolete. Something that needs to be fixed. - Contracts. Seriously, when these were added it gave new life to the game. There's an objective beyond reaching a max level and it rewards you pretty well. Recently they added a camo you can unlock via contract and it's dope.  Campaign: - This campaign had the help of Jason Blundell, thus the story itself takes digging. Therein lies the problem; people who play CoD rarely have enough brain power or will to search for answers to comprehend a story. They prefer things presented directly to their face without any effort put in to dig deeper. So when a game like CoD does this, you can expect criticism from idiots to follow. That's pretty evident from a large majority of the negative reviews.  Zombies: - Possibly the best zombies experience to date. Jason Blundell has outdone himself and while wirting this review Revelations is coming out in 3 days. Every map before it has been amazing in attention to detail and character dialogue. Any fan of the zombies canon and not strict gameplay will find this as an intriguing story while those who only play for gameplay might be confused but will have fun with the game nonetheless.  The criticism I have for this game, despite all my praise, is how the game was released. Poorly optimized for PC, a plethora of bugs, etc. However, Treyarch stepped their game up and patched virtually every bug in Campaign, Multiplayer, and for the most part Zombies. If I was reviewing this game on release day after I had played through the Campaign, Multiplayer, and Shadows of Evil, I would probably have not recommended it. Now, it's one of the most polished Call of Dutys in recent years, despite how patchy it was on release.   Also, official mod tools.

The workarounds are to drop your settings low enough to get a very high fps (&gt;150 was good), which is unacceptable, use Vsync (which introduces input lag anyway, just no where near as much but enough to not play), or to lock your framerate to just below your monitors refresh rate, but that ended up introducing stuttering for some reason.

Anything positive???    No.... well maybe the sniping is fun... VMP tho.... yeah ♥♥♥♥ this game but for some reason I still play it because when the servers are alright and the vmp players are low I get to own some noobs and that's what makes me come back.    So.... you kinda enjoy the game?    No ♥♥♥♥ you, ♥♥♥♥ this game, if you buy it then good luck.  I'll now give you a little score out of 10  3/10 and that's being nice... hopefully the next call of duty will fix these horrible problems that just make the game crap.",

            "review_text": "Well, I think this might be the beginning of the end of the COD franchise. Sad, really. I've been a COD fan since the original release over 10 years ago. However, the devs seem insanely insistent upon using the antiquated Quake engine and its inherently broken net code as the foundation for new COD releases. Anyway, I don't need to rehash all of the well known engineering shortcomings of Treyarch et al.  As far as BO3 goes, I will start with the campaign aspect. I will sum it up in two words: Not Good. I don't know what they did with the mouse interface, but, its clumsy and somewhat laggy. None of the mouse sensitivity settings, filtering or acceleration features have any impact on the problem,   The graphics are ok and appear to be better optimized than AW. However, they are still just a warmed over, repackaged offering of the previous COD releases.   As far as the actual campaign play itself is concerned, its bad. There are far too many cut scenes and despite having good actors, the acting is poor and the dialogue is worse. It seems as thought they tried too hard to make this some sort of trippy mind sch♥♥♥♥. Overall, the campaign lacked direction and was constantly interrupted by far too many cut scenes.   The campaign story line itself is the same recycled story line that follows our fearless hero through a gauntlet of issues that have the same plot twist (the ally turned villain twist) as the last few releases. Its tired and its time for something new.   The multiplayer experience is somewhat improved with the elimination of the ridiculous exo-suit jumping. Weapon usage is not as efficient as AW or the previous releases. There are still OP'd weapons and the options for perks and attachments is somewhat the same.   The inherent netcode latency is still ever present and a real downer. Of course, that is to be expected since they are still using the antiquated Quake engine. The lag compensation is horrible and once again, hobbles players with good systems and connections to the utter elimination of skill based kills.   However, judging the game as a whole, its not worth the hype and is not worth the hefty $60 price tag.   Call of Duty Black Ops III is just another stepping stone in the sad and tragic decline of a once great franchise.",

            "review_text": "UPDATE - Original Review Below  So admittedly, after overcoming the MULTITUDES of initial problems this game has with just being able to work properly, the game itself is fun, very funn  I will still not recommend this game though.  As fun as it is, the hitboxes in multiplayer are pathetic. I usually have 30-45 ping and in MOST games I will pump enemies with dozens of bullets, only to be taken down in one shot from the same player. The kill cam shows something completely different. Change lobbies, sometimes this problem goes away, most times it doesn't.  Not to mention, at the time of writing it is 7pm on a Friday evening, about a week after release. My NAT is 'open' and there is ONE half empty game of Domination available to play.   I play a few games a night and at least one in five games is plagued by a hacker dominating everyone and completely ruining the experience. I have never played an online game with this much hacking and cheating.  In short, it is a laggy piece of ♥♥♥♥ game with constant disconnects and other nonesense. While fun, I will be moving on as soon as there is something else to play.  I don't feel like I have got my monies worth and with the revenue this series generates, there are NO excuses for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ performance, other than developer/publisher greed and apathy towards their customer.  These problems have been around in every COD game and are completely unacceptable. So again, ♥♥♥♥ YOU Treyarch and ♥♥♥♥ YOU Activision for not doing the right thing and skimping on your customers. You are now both on my blacklist. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Do NOT buy this game. As a community, let's stop supporting these greedy and incompetant ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that are happy to release products that are broken beyond belief. Where else would ANYONE put up with this?!?  I get 1-2 FPS in the main menu, the MAIN MENU! If I click a menu item, it takes 20 seconds to respond, then just crashes to desktop. Right now, this is just a worthless waste of space.  Everyone involved with this game should be ashamed right now... I am ashamed for even considering it would be a half decent game, let alone buying it.  Activision and Treyach, from the bottom of my heart... ♥♥♥♥ YOU. As a consumer,who simply wanted to enjoy your product, ♥♥♥♥ YOU For knowing the game is COMPLETELY broken on PC and releasing it anyway, ♥♥♥♥ YOU For thinking it's acceptable to treat your customers like fools, ♥♥♥♥ YOU For being god damn lazy and cheap with your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ PC port, ♥♥♥♥ YOU  Fool me once, shame on me...

Each team has their spawning site and most of the competetive maps only has 1-2 different entrances to each bombsite.

I used to play on 60-90fps high-extra settings on AW when it first came out, after the patches on AW I went down to medium-high settings. BO3 beta was basically the same, but BO3 in it's current state gives me 60 fps with an occasional drop on low settings. Does BO3 look any better than AW? NOPE, but it requires more resources, It wouldn't suprise me if they're just adding code filling to make the game seem next-gen/graphically intensive.. especially since pirated AW could run on far lower specs than the legal version... I regret my purchase so much, playing this game is just depressing, but I feel like I have to get my money's worth and play it. I played since MW, on console, which was fun as hell. But the CODs after MW are just losing quality with each release. Maybe the COD formula just got boring to me, but B03 has features like paintshop that don't work 50% of the time.. The game itself crashes when I close it sometimes and it always has a lingering effect on my system's resources a couple minutes after closing it. Sure, they announced modding/mapping tools that MIGHT (It'll probably get delayed) come out March 2016 in CLOSED ALPHA. The final product will probably come out when BO4 or whatever the fudge they decide to call it comes out. This is my last COD, activison sucks, I bought this and didn't return it, since Treyarch usually makes great ports (look at BO and BO2) and allowed myself to play over 2 hours. You're paying 60$, not including DLC, for a reskin with slightly different movement and headaches, every gun is identical to some gun in a previous COD, gg activision, your cash cow is gonna die soon anyways, at least on PC.",

Welcome to future, 2070 year when robots, mechanics and etc is alive and you got some jetpack/exo suits. Welcome to Black Ops 3 - let's get started with pros and then cons!  * Campaign Campaign is pretty solid, to be honest, it tells you are story about nano chips, upgrades and pointing to you, that friends can betray you any time anywhere. Its not that long, but if you want to complete it on Veteran difficulty it will be longer of course. Overall, not that bad like people is saying about that, (they probably don't complete it on veteran difficulty). Yes, it's a bit linear, because it's Call of Duty, but every single CoD campaign is like that (run and gun), also in campaign map is kinda restricted which sucks, but in 'Nightmare' mode it's not.. Overall 7/10  * Multiplayer Hm, what to say about this game mode, its kinda classic, same as previous games, it feels like a game mode or DLC rather than full game, but, in other way it feels different because of jetpack (much more easier to use than EXO suit) and also you can run on walls (Prince of Persia style). Its rapid, its ultra fast mode and its fast paced, so, if you want to buy this game, PLAY WITH BOTS ON HARD DIFFICULTY before you get into the multiplayer, or you will be slaped in face by prestige masters or other people who plays this game a lot, and you will not understand how are they so overpowered! Also, in MP you get Cryptokeys for finished match to open common and rare drops -- similar copy/paste from Counter Strike Global Offensive, but it completely free (except if you are idiot to buy for 50 dollars CoD points and open those crates for untradable skins). Also, much better is that you actually get cryptos for free when you playing a lot, they on CS GO when you get almost nothing... Overall 7/10  *Zombies What can I say about mode that keep this game alive and other Call of Duty games. Its fantastic, have a great maps, but you can get a only one 'Shadow of evil' with based game, other are DLC, but, important and better news is that game IS getting MOD TOOLS AND MAP EDITOR FOR ZOMBIES!!! After 7-8 years it will come to Black Ops 3 on October 2016.! This game mode dont have and futuristic stuff, any jetpacks, its normal and just run and gun with milion fantastic easter eggs over map! Overall 9/10  *Nightmare mode - Story mode with Zombies   Its story mode but with Zombies all over the map, its great option for people who like to play zombie mode like me. It feels like DLC, but its completely free and great option to see how will other single player maps will work with zombies. 8/10  *Freerun  Pretty solid training mode for jetpack and running, its pretty solid option to have if you dont know how to use jetpack system properly  Overall 7/10  Lets get with cons now because this game got a lot of cons :D.  * Campaign - Game AI is so horrible, its so stupid that enemies will kill you through wall in veteran difficulty, its like wallhacking, also, I got r9 290x GPU, but also on nVidia, you can see some graphical glitches and pixelated textures even if your game is setted to a maximal graphics and effects. - Some enemies got randomly more health than others but when you restart the checkpoint it will be reduced to normal as it should be before, lol. - Some checkpoints can be glitched and automatically get you killed aka. spawn to die checkpoint..  *Multiplayer -Microtransactions - COD points are cancer, before, in older games, you can get everything for free, now you can get almost everything for free, but you need to play too much game for some unlock, COD points costs from 2-50 dollars or euros depends on your country -Some weapons are so overpowered, also perks, but thats optional thing, and it will probably be fixed in more updates. -Community - its so toxic, cancerogenic that i can't describe, too much kids raging, too much kiddy boosted Prestige masters peeps that can actually mod their game for some pre-fire assets and wallhacking, but don't get me wrong this game got some excellent and brutally good players, but most of players are not cooperative and don't want to play together like team. -Cancerogenic camping with shotgun or rapid snipers - oh yes, people and kids in this game can camp for whole game with rapid shotgun - so noobish, and so cancerogenic - It's not tactic its noobish thing, you know - don't get me wrong, I destroyed them anyway.. -Random FPS drops in this game is soooo bad, I got R9 290X, Intel Xeon CPU from 2007 with 3.0 GHz, and 8 GB of RAM, and game is runing most of time 80 fps avg, but in some random places it can be 10 fps but in next spawn it will be normal, so stuttering and drops are here which is bad (also in Zombie mode too). -Did I mentioned spawn to die system - yes its here like in previous games... -NAT Type, uggggghhhh, its so annoying that you play with friends and just after 2 hours session, lobby will crash and you must restart your game and router to make it work again, because game changes your NAT type to strict randomly (even with port forwarding) -Even with 30MB/S you get about 30-60 ping - I live in Serbia, and on other games I got 10 ping easily...  *Zombies -Game stuttering on Shadow of Evil map on Footlight district is so bad, it will random drop your FPS from 100 to 20 and will lagg a little bit.. -Sometimes game can randomly stutter anywhere, because its not patched properly since February month... -Servers are slowly dying in this mode, but they will be back because mod tools will be soon released. -In this game mode also, sessions longer than 2 hours with friends will crash and disconnect you from servers - annoying stuff... -Drop system is extra rare, even if you open doors, buying weapons and etc. you can barely get 3-4 Liquid Diviniums (keys for Gobblegums)  *Nightmare -Some zombies have a glitched health - one of them needs to be shooted 3 times in head, some casual zombies with casual health must be shooted 10 times in head with powerfull weapon - strange glitch in veteran difficulty.. -Zombies can glitch in your back which gives you instadeath - even if they needed to spawn in front of you.  *Graphics - not so good in this game, because its 9 years old engine with newer stuff in him but, you can easily see a pixels, blurry textures and bugs over maps and textures, so 6/10 for graphics (on maxed detail) - I think some older CoDs looks more polished. *Gameplay - its classic and you will enjoy it, but minor glitches and bugs can frustrate you as ♥♥♥♥ 7/10 Overall, I can give this game a honest 7/10. Its super game, but got some really, really bad glitches, also cancerogenic community... ",

By the way no one plays this game online. -So here's the poop It's call of duty, what do you expect at this point I mean really? You are either a moron who plays it because of peer presure from dumb ♥♥♥ friends or some weird type of non gamer who feels obligated to buy the same broken game every year, luckily I'm neither. -Performance This pc port was some fine garbage, the games audio is disabled when using more then 2 speakers so i have to disable surround sound in my operating system just to get audio working. The game runs smooth when it's not crashing randomly on menus or freezing trying to load a match, decent performance as far as frames per second goes but I will say i get much higher fps on games that are more visually complex. -Gameplay The gameplay itself hasnt changed except for wall running which is actually very fun, wall running and the explosive bow and arrow are the best part of this game, it's so satisfying sharp shooting with a explosive bolt. The level design is focused around the wall running mechanic and the levels over all seem more arena like which i enjoy in a game like this, but the maps are often turned stupid when people use the rolling robot perks, it's total explosion spam. The character selection is weird, it's all female and one cyborg male who happens to be black, thank you social justice.. -Verdict I can't play anything other then team death match and death match because no one plays this ♥♥♥♥ online (atleast for pc), I feel like steam users or pc gamers in general are becomming more aware of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t games and ignore them better then console gamers do, and thank God because I'm sick of main stream gaming being the same thing year after year. This game isnt worth purchasing but I will say it's the funnest call of duty since 2007.",

The dedis are fine, I havent experienced any lag whatsoever as far as that. It's a new release, there's gonna be bugs, there's gonna be issues, and it makes me sort of sad to see ALL these bad reviews about game performance, when the game itself is perfectly fine. No one understands developers have to be able to optimize the game for the millions of different hardware configurations out and it does take time most of the time. But I've noticed most people are complaining the game isnt optimized, and they're trying to run it on high settings with a 650 and other lower end cards, and 70% of those bad reviews are generally due to people not understand how textures work. I have a 4770k and a 980 STRIX. The game uses a little over 3gb for me with high textures, therefore anyone trying to do that on low end cards with less then 3GB of VRAM just arent going to get good performance, it simply wont work with ANY game. It's not the devs fault for that. The game is AMAZING, one of my fav cods so far. And I tend to only like treyarch games recently anyway as they're always the best optimized and fit my playstyle. But patches will come, the game will get better.",

Quite literally once played it goes deep into your computer and sucks it dry. After starting this steaming pile of horse turd, my pc memory usage goes up to 95%. For flip sake 95% of 20gb ram being used for a game?!?! Worst part is, the game even after closure causes the system to go ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and start having a seizure.  MY SPECS:  Intel Core i7 4790k OC'd to 4.6ghz  Nvidia Geforce gtx 980 ti clocked to about 1178mhz 20gb of ddr3 1333mhz ram  Now, the settings I play this cancer on: Resolution 800x600 Resolution scale 50%  Everything else, lowest possible settings  Can you believe even on these settings I do not get a solid 60, in shootouts (nearly always as to the nature of the game) my fps drops under 10fps!!! If anyone could please tell me how to get this SOB of a game working then I'd be really happy, I have yet to play a port worse than this, and oh yes I've played Unity, I can at least get 40-60 on highest settings there. Now bear in mind, this isn't a review on how good the game is itself, it's a review on the ♥♥♥♥ING DISGUSTING PERFORMANCE. Avoid if you have specs similar to mine because I've heard that other people can run it perfectly on lower specs, I assume it may be a specific problem to higher end computers???  10/10 will infect my pc with aids again. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Update as of 18/11/15: Now that finally all the performance problems have been fixed (constant 60fps on a 4K DSR) I can finally play the god damn game to review it, I will eventually get round to it. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Second update as of 8/8/16: The game sucks balls I tried to honestly review it considering I recently bought another 980 ti and a lot more ram but the game is just turd and normally I would say wait for the next release but the next release is call of duty space ships so that's money well spent, go for BF1 or just dont buy a call of duty until they sort their ♥♥♥♥ out and figure out what type of game they want to be.

Although im sure this will be fixed soon, as the game is out for a few weeks now.  - Campers There are lots of campers, mostly in Nuk3town in the windows.  - Supply drops At first i enjoyed the supply drops, but then Activision ruined it with making it P2W I still love the cosmetics out of it though!  + Fun This game brings lots of fun, the one match you can try to diehard, the other you can derp around with a knife!  + Lots of challanges This game is beautifull, it has like a TON of challanges! Hero armor, gold, unlockable guns (Supply drops...)  * SP: Will be updated when i finished the SinglePlayer  * ZO: I love playing The Giant, and Der Eisendrache.

This game (and the most recent entries in the series) is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ized cash grab whos new ideas harm the formula more than help it. I urge those on the fence about buying the multiplayer component to stop, decide what you're looking for in entertainment, and to look elsewhere.  The game's increased mobility and map layout means you are never safe, and even the most cautious, well thought out approach will be punished by an auto-shotgun shells volleyed into your backside...over and over again. However, if this is your fate count yourself lucky, as more often you will be continually brutalized by some form of 'freebie kills' that every player has access to, and will abuse, to varying effect. You will die, often, to mechanics you have no control over, and even the most seasoned player (myself included) finds incredibly frusterating. Unfortunately, the game moves SO fast that even the tenacity to get back into the fight is often not enough, as every engagement ends and starts over so quickly the kills quickly become meaningless.  Most guns aren't viable, just hearing that controllers getting aim assist on the PC leaves a bad taste in my mouth, and you will struggle against what is left of the community - that is to say a handful of individuals that for whatever reason, still play this game only to roll people in groups of no less than 4-6.

In that case the game After the Wait of the Unpacking ,  Started a whole New Story. The Game Played the Intro &amp; Went Black Did nothing stay at a Capped 60 FPS, i Closed the game after awhile thinking it was Setting itself up. But it took 2 try to start Up the game . Than to Notice that it takes about 3 Minutes to start up as i just put it in backround &amp; started hearing sound as we Where all Watching Netflix. So i Booted it up , Played a game of Mulitiplayer ,  Enjoyed myself , seen a few Graphic Related Problems Thought nothing of it for now as i was Recording my Gameplay. Round finished so i decided to go try zombies , But before i could do anything their was no loading screen in the load from mulitiplayer to the xp menu thing. It was pure blue. So i went on to Zombies , Gosh. Everybody was Drop from the Game Besides myself &amp; one other player. When we turned on the Power It glitched someone out &amp; they just logged of. the Next person was Playing till we Got to round 16 , The Dogs came. It lagged him out so hard with his mouse movements that he had to Backout of the game.  Its sad to say this may be the Next Batman Game,  I think it should have Been a EA Game .

            "review_text": "Ok after 10 hours I can review this game I guess. I will split this review in 3 parts. I will describe each mode. I will describe the campaign, zombies and multiplayer.   The Campaign : Storytechnical it´s the typical Cod campaign with many explosions and bullets. The brutality has also increased a lot which you will find out when you play it. The new campaign system is great in my opinion. You can now play the campaign in co-op with other players or your friends from now which I find really cool in my opinion. There is also a level up system in the campaign. The higher the diffuculty level of each mission is the higher will be your XP reward. For the guns you can unlock attatchments and cammos that are for the campaign than. You need to complete certain challenges for it. I think the campaign itself didn´t changed much in an gameplay technical view but it brings new features which is worth to try out as I would say. Also the storyline is quite good and rly playable :D   Multiplayer: Yeah the multiplayer. Every year the same from Activision and their partner studio. It is really the typical Cod multiplayer but still it´s much fun. They removed the booster packs which we had in AW which I found annoying as hell. There is only small boost jump but nothing to compare with in AW. A new movement feauture is that you can now wall run . There are again 10-11 prestiges levels. You unlock items, abillitys etc over unlock tockens which you unlock after every level. You can now unlock an item or abillity that is unlocked for the your level. It always requires an certain level and an unlock tocken to unlock the thing you want. That is basicly all I can say about the multiplayer. There are no reall new gameplay modes and yeah... same as every year with a few small changes :D .  Zombie mode: The zombie mode is awesome, fun and totally woth to play with your friends, alone or with public players. Sadly there is only one map if you haven´t pre-orderd the game. I bought the season pass as well just because of the zombie maps. The map that everyone has playes in chicago in the early 1930s ( Al Capone time) which I really love the atmosphere of it. The zombie mode is again a endless zombie wave mode. You fight as long as you can and try to make as many points as possible to buy your weapons, perks, upgrades and so on . On the chicago map you need to turn into ' The beast ' first to turn on the electricity. Also you level up here as well by killing zombies and your zombie rank increases with it. Dont ask me what advantage you have of it... I didn´t found it so far.  Overall I really love the zombie mode and I can really recommend this even when there is only one map for normal players so far. I can recommend to get the season pass tbh.   Overall I would say that Black Ops 3 isn´t a bad game and it offers a few changes in the Call of Duty franchise but on the other side it has the classic features like in every other one. I would say you guys should grab this game on sale for like 50% off and might get the season pass as well.   Rating: 7.5/10 ( including all game modes )",

These reviews should talk about the game when it's working as its intended, which in my opinion, is superb. The campaign was of a fairly decent length, very interesting, albeit a bit confusing, story. Multiplayer is as always, incredibally fluid, and this time around they've done a good job with the class system, as well as the specialist system, and finally, zombies, the main reason I bought the game, the new map shadows of evil is very well made, great style, lots of things to do, The Giant (Remastered Der Reise) is also a great pleasure to play once again. The progression system is also a good new addition to zombies, all in all, great game, one of the best cod's so far. Highly Recommend.",

Now, that may or may not be true, each persons opinion is their own. Here's mine:  This game brings the francise back to the good times, back with the original Black Ops. There is a greater appeal for this game than the previous ones with the increased amount of movement mechanics that actually make it possible to be a competetive game. It isn't anything in terms of competetive like Counter-Strike as it's still literally a run and gun first person shooter, but I think there were some good steps to getting the COD games back on track to being a decent francise again.  Actual Review:  It has zombies. That alone makes it 10/10",

Zombies: The Zombie community is basically dead (Atleast in EU) but you can still find some lobbies from time to time, the maps (The Giant remake of Der Riese and Shadows of Evil a city) Are both really enjoyable. The main easter egg for Shadows of Evil is boring but difficult to complete. For the Easter Egg hunters again, there's alot of Easter Eggs we're still discovering in Zombies and probably alot of them we won't find anytime soon  Campaign: I personally didn't like it, not much to talk about.

All in all, I'd recommend it if you enjoyed MW2 and MW3 (the last CoD games I played) - it doesn't stray very far from that style of gameplay. One thing that's better about this iteration is that Treyarch appears to take cheating seriously, and gives players the tools to easily record suspected cheaters from the cheater's point of view (the reporting part of the equation leaves something to be desired though, but better than nothing). From what I've seen in the forums, the obvious cheaters are banned pretty quickly, within 24 hours or so.  Bottom line, if you enjoyed previous COD games, you'll likely enjoy this one. If you aren't a fan of small maps and jackrabbit-on-crack players bouncing and jumping around everywhere, you probably won't ;)  (To be honest, there is also an issue with only being able to play TDM and DOM due to the matchmaking system, but that seems to be all anyone wants to play in ANY FPS that isn't CS:GO these days, so it's not a problem specific to CoD)",

Of course it's very futuristic and I think that's one of the few thing that a dragging the game down.  Since black ops 2 Went up to 2025 with it's story, the developers decided to continue the story but isn't that a little too far? At the end of BO2 everything was explained and pretty much the whole story was complete. This is just a little dragging, I can't argue that I liked the story in BO3 but seriously how far will Treyarch be dragging the same idea? To be fair BO2 was like the end now in BO3 the story sends us to 2065 what in my opinion is just a little too futuristic for the cod franchise. We need more COD games to become back to the World At War Standards and times and maybe the MW (1,2,3) franchises. Taking it back to the old days where the whole thing was a little more realistic.  However to finish off I have to recommend the game to other COD Fans out there as it's simply another good game from Treyarch and Activision :) ======================================== UPDATE: Many improvements have been put in place. On PC the game is now much more Flawless and better optimised therefore, FPS drops in a gunfight or any random moments are very rare. ================================== Multiplayer - What a great benefit in Black Ops 3 is that All 3: Campaign, zombies and multiplayer are in one place on the main screen and there is no need to download any extra content, like it was needed to in every single previous Call Of Duty game. This saves alot of time and makes it much more easier for everyone to access all of the game's features.",

            "review_text": "Okay, I re-write my review of BO3 (by the way: I only talk about the multiplayer of this game).  And I don't recommend to buy it, however I will probably still be playing it. Why? One reason are my friends who play this game but I like the game itself as well.  So I try to explain. I like this game. Often people complain about performance issues while it runs smoothly for me, but I have a good PC. I think they should tone it down a bit or use different approaches who use less ressources so a broader set of people can play this game. The hitboxes are fine, not any worse as in other online games I play.  I only played 2 CoDs in my life: BO2 and BO3. I liked both.  I could now longly explain in detail how I like the sliding, jetpacks and the specialists as they add new fresh aspects to the game, but that's not what I want to tell in this review. Either you'll like it or not, my words wont change anything.  But there are 2 main things that I don't like: 1) COD Points in the Black Market and Weapons in the Black Market 2) The people playing this game  The game costs 60€. 40 more with the season pass which, as I found out, only saves like 10 bucks. But you can buy COD Points in order to get rare supply drops in the black market (you can buy the drops with cryptokeysaswell which you can get with normal playing). 200 Points = 1 Supply Drop = 2€ (I think also = 2$). But here is the thing, ypu can get weapons in the supply drops. Not only reskins like the butterfly or the baseball bat but real different weapons. Weapons which have their ups and downs. I don't know if any of them are OP as I haven't played them, but it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off. The Black Market is a gambling system. You can spend 20€ and not get a single weapon. You can spend 10€ and get two. You can spend 200€ and get no weapons. I spend around 200€ and got only 3 weapons, 1 Brass Knuckles and 2 Baseball Bats. The double Baseball Bat is worth nothing. I'm not here to blame Tryarch or Activision for the 200€ I spend, it was my choice. But the gambling aspect is very dangerous. People spend tons of money and get nothing. Maybe after 100€ they get one item and so they spend more to get another one. Maybe they don't even get what they want. Maybe they never get what they want. All in all do I not support this system, so don't buy this game. And don't buy the next CoD. Just stop geving them money. They make already enough on the poor souls gambling in the black market. They're better off playing in a casino in Las Vegas as there they can get real money. In the Black market they get worthless stuff which they can't trade and which is even more worthless when the next CoD comes out. Or the one after that. Or the one after THAT.  Now to the 2nd Point: The people playing this game. I often hear it's normal, I should get used to it. And I got used to it. It scares me. People often insult when you don't play as good as others. Even your own team bashes you, even when you're a noob trying out the game for the first time. They often blame the team for their loss and their deaths. When you're a little more skilled you're a hacker or someone with no life. When you play in a way people don't approve they will insult you with some pretty heavy insults, wishing you to die slowly. Even my friends do this and they are like 'eh, it's normal'. But I just find this disturbing. It's just awfull. Just disable the Chat. Both voice chat and text chat. Well, sometimes you need to activate the mic ingame to speak in skype or TS, but you can still mute all except the party. Trust me. People will insult you when you play to bad and when you play to good. When you play knife only or shotgun just for fun or when you use a strong reliable weapon.  I will play this game, I already bought it. But I don't know if I would buy it again.",

Low skill players will have a steep learning curve to start. -Controller usage gives aim assist, which in some cases is a very unfair advantage. -Cod Points: Micro transactions. Yes, this game has microtransactions even though you are paying full price. -Random package loot system. Lots of cosmetic items and new weapons. All are locked behind a fully random system. Some players who have played since release are yet to get one.  +Addendum: There is now guaranteed weapons and they are stepping up the package frequency with contracts.  To be honest kinda too little too late. We'll see what happens when it's fully implemented. -DLC packs are EXTREMELY low content. Four maps and a zombie map. For ~15 bucks.  -This game desires to latch on to your wallet and never let go.   Overall, good game but poor practices mean the entire CoD franchise is becoming a waste of time. Shame.",

Right off the bat we have players donning clown camo and pink guns and communist emblems (seriously if I had a penny for evey hammer and sickles I see then I would ironically be a rich man...) and their running around the map having 13 kill streaks with a f**king crow bar...  This is Call of Duty today.  Its a franchise which has been milked to death to the point where Activision even prop up its dead body and use it for what its worth even if what it is; is a acknowledged parody of itself. Sillyness has officially been embraced and has even become part of the marketing. Queue David Bowies Major Tom...  I dont kow why anyone asks for a WW2 COD because what you will get is people running around with swasticka shurikens and thompson machine guns with hello kitty camo.  Now look, I get that people enjoy it and thats fine, it can be a fun game at times, but I just dont like what COD has allowed itself to become. I think everyone agrees that COD4/WAW/MW2 were the haydays, and despite the negativity towards this franchise I find myself wondering in awe as I look to the stars and ponder about why I am not enjoying or playing COD right now. Is something wrong with me? Am I not doing it right? Surely it cant be as bad as everyone is saying it is?  I can see people still enjoy this game and hats off to you. I know I shouldnt be posting a stupid rant but I just felt like I needed to.  When I play COD, after 3 or so matches I dont enjoy myself, infact I even feel physically sick. I know that sounds dramatic but... Its such a wierd experience I dont know how to explain it properly. The game emulates an environment which wants us to transcend a shooter game to the feel of being in a skate rink with trickshots, cool moves, 'check out my camo' and chicken dances at the end of the game, all the while kiddies and grown men making junior school era insults at each other and accusing each other of being 'hackers' when really your failure is them exploiting a well known over powered factor of the game.  It feels like a task, not because there exists a challenge but I have to make an effort to take part in this new strain of 'competition' where we all have to acknowledge the exploits and how we can profit from it. Exploits such as hit delay or 'using a specific class I made ready to compensate for the lag I am currently experiencing which the host will surely profit from' or something or other that should not be the central focus of the experience but somehow is.  I just dont know anymore.  The very thought of playing COD makes me recoil.  You see COD was designed to reward our brain with the points, killstreaks and quick tactical decisions and what not, and thats the game it should be, but now because of its accepted deroding into a product not built for satisfactory quality but rather purely market hype to the COD only masses who buy an Xbox solely for it; what was COD has evolved with a guided hand into gigantic collection of hyperboles of what made it great in the first place. Now it causes chemical reactions in my brain which cause depression and frustration.  And the worst part is, as far as I can tell, even the fans that still remain know this... Im not saying you shouldnt enjoy it, and Im not trying to be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on something you may like, but the thought just occured to me and now here is the review :/",

            "review_text": "Not for $79.99, anyway. Don't get me wrong, Black Ops III is a good game. But Black Ops II was a great game... and for $79.99 (Canadian launch price), Black Ops III better blow it out of the water.  Let's start with the good. You can choose your character's gender! I never thought I'd see this in Call of Duty of all places, but here it is. I don't see her becoming as popular as FemShep, though, because while the voice acting is serviceable, it's not exceptional. The male voice is Ben Browder, so unless he phoned in his lines it's not going to be terrible like Mark Meer's Shepard.  There are other women in the game, and female enemies as well, and they're realistic and not heavily sexualized. Of course, they get beat up and blown up like their male counterparts, too. As Trudeau would say, it's 2015. I'm not trying to damn by faint praise- sexism in video games is a big issue and I think Black Ops III took a big, bold step forward here.  Gameplay. Probably the best in any Call of Duty game I've played (basically all except Advanced Warfare and some early console exclusives), with some minor issues here and there. You have various abilities now, kind of like Bioshock Infinite or Mass Effect. In fact, they're probably ripped straight out of those games, but I'll get to that later.  You also have an advanced HUD that shows you where enemies are and what's shooting at you, which sounds like a bit of a cheat but doesn't feel like it in game. It's still pretty linear and pretty closed, but combat is fast paced and satisfying. Let's be clear- this is nothing groundbreaking, but there are some good additions to the formula.  So what are the minor issues? There's a flying mission. It's even worse than the one in Black Ops II. You unlock new abilities, weapons, and attachments as the game progresses. While the sense of progression is nice, you start with very little compared to what was available in Black Ops II. And there are occasional points in the game where you'll have to hunt down something that's almost impossible to find, or make it through a ridiculous segment without dying because there aren't enough checkpoints, or just fight an obscene number of enemies. But these are pretty minor and rare.  In other words, the best part of Black Ops III is gameplay. And it's got quite a bit- eight hours isn't long compared to, say, Fallout, but it's one of the longest Call of Duty campaigns to date.  The story is... bad. It's not as bad as Ghosts (the worst in Call of Duty history in my opinion), but it's not good. Mostly, it's too ambitious. Modern Warfare didn't promise much and it didn't have trouble delivering. Black Ops always promised more- the first one was a mixed bag but the second one actually delivered.  Black Ops III reaches far and falls hard. I don't want to spoil it, but the storyline of Black Ops III is incredibly cliched and quite poorly done. It tries to be a kind of cerebral sci-fi, but it doesn't actually bring up issues very often and when it does it just kind of glosses over them. It juggles themes, unsure of what it actually wants to say. It came across as really pretentious, to be honest, and more or less stopped making sense near the end. In other words, while Black Ops II was focused, Black Ops III is all over the place.  But, maybe how a story is told matters more than the story itself. Too bad Black Ops III flubs that, too.  There are a few big issues with storytelling. The first is atmosphere. Modern Warfare felt epic. Black Ops II felt personal. Black Ops III feels... well, kind of floundering. It's neither epic nor personal, just kind of flat.  The second is investment. You don't really invest into any of the characters, because we know nothing about any of them. Black Ops II had two games to build this, but Black Ops III never really does.  You don't really invest into the world, either, because we know exactly nothing about it. Your side is the Winslow Accord, which has something to do with bio-augmentation. On the other side is the NRC, which I'm assuming is not actually the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, but it might as well be because I think the exapnsion of the abbreviation was stated only once and I missed it. This is a future where everyone's watched, bio-engineering is commonplace, and there have been cataclysmic events around the globe. But you only ever see tiny slices of it and there just isn't enough context given.  Speaking generally, although it's added a lot of new stuff, Black Ops III is missing almost everything that made its predecessor so great. There are no decisions like you had in Black Ops II and the story isn't dynamic. While that's not necessarily a bad thing- there are plenty of great games that are entirely static- it feels like a step backwards. Story-wise, it doesn't have the focused personal narrative of BO2, the relevant near-future world of BO2, or the historical connections of the other two Black Ops games.  Black Ops III doesn't really feel like it should be Black Ops III, or even Call of Duty at all. It doesn't connect with the other Black Ops games in any significant way, and if it wasn't for a single blatant mention you wouldn't even know it was in the same universe. The lack of continuity is really disappointing in particular, because Black Ops II did such a good job of following up on the first game.  As for being a Call of Duty game, it's too sci-fi, not so much in setting but in theme, to be Call of Duty. It's too cerebral- or at least it tries to be- and it doesn't really fit the mold of Call of Duty games in terms of narrative structure. It's not pushing boundaries in the way Black Ops II did, it just... doesn't feel like Call of Duty.  I haven't tried multiplayer at all. If it's good, and if multiplayer is your thing, then maybe Black Ops III is worth full price. But I don't know, and I don't play much.  A quick word on technical aspects. Usually, I don't say much about these, because it's rarely in the forefront of my mind and that means it's at least good enough. Black Ops III looks pretty good, but you'll need a beefy system to crank the settings up- my 770 does a decent job at high (not ultra) at 1080p with the antialiasing backed off, but it does lag at times. The infamous stuttering seems to have been fixed- I didn't notice any of it. The sound design is still inferior to what Infinity Ward pulled off with Modern Warfare 3 in 2011- notably, suppressed weapons are often louder than non-suppressed ones. And the music... well, it unsurprisingly sounds like Mass Effect, and it's serviceable but not as good as previous Call of Duty games.  Is it worth playing? I think it is. The gameplay is solid, and it does bring some interesting new stuff to the table. But wait for a sale. It may be the most expensive game in the series, but it's far from the best.",

In my opinion the game itself is not bad as it has some qualities from Black Ops 2 (ONE OF THE BEST CODs OF ALL TIME), like some of its physics and that great feel Treyarch don't fail to provide....  HOWEVER (GOTTA LOVE THIS PART)  Most Call Of Duty's, lately, have been set so far in the future, that it makes it seem fake and unrealistically impossible. The guns are all made up, to be futuristic of course, but compare it Black Ops 2/ MW2/ MW3, you could probably find every single one of the guns in that game in a gun stores and thats what makes it more realistic, knowing that the creators have gone that extra mile to find out what guns are out there... not some s**t conjured up in an art studio, because it looks cool.  Overall   I would say that if you are 100% a COD fan, then go ahead and buy the game, but don't expect it to have the same experience as Black Ops 2 or any of the previously SUCCESSFUL CODs.",

Sadly, every year I get let down a little bit more. This year what I thought was going to be an exception turned out not to be. The game is amazing but I'm really afraid that the same thing will happen to this game that happened to Advanced Warfare, where eventually, everyone stopped playing the game ergo making it impossible to play. Disappointingly, this game is having some of the same issue ON DAY 4! I LOVE THIS GAME!! Sadly, I think people will lose interest quickly  The loud mouthed 1% who are unable to play kept a lot of people from buying the game. I barely have a $600 rig and am still capable of playing the game at medium-max settings with no fragmenting/lag   TL;DR  I think this year's Call of Duty is far better than the past two, and even a little better than it's predecessor, Black Ops II. The game runs smoothly, with great graphics, and immersive gameplay, but people are going to lose interest and I'm not going to have any friends to play with.  Overall, I recommend Call of Duty: Black Ops III. If we could get enough people to buy it, and play it for a while, it'd be hours of fun.",

            "review_text": "The PC version is terrible!! If you have a console buy it for the console, it is a lot better on console and here are a few reasons why. First, the hit registration on the PC sucks. I have seen it happen about 70% of the time when the bullets should hit but they don't and if you watch your own killcam it will show you aiming somewhere else. basically the killcam view and your view show something completely from one another and makes the hit registration garbage.  Second, The servers have a lot of latency issues. You wIll be lagging 3 out 5 matches. It seems that the deves. focus more on the console version than the PC version. This game would be better if they fix these issues. With the console version these problems don't happen as much, you will probably see the hit registration be bad about 30% of the time and 2 out 10 matches will be laggy.  Third, the default button layout sucks, you are going to be spending about 30 minutes adjusting your button layout. Some of the default buttons are awkward and it took me about 30 minutes to find the right button layout for me. I played the first 30 minutes of the campaign to find the right layout.  Also more people play on the console too, so your game options are a lot better. You are more likely to find gun game matches and FFA matches if you are in those game modes. Bonus mathces are more easier to find on console than PC.  So if you have a console to buy BO3 for console ignore the PC Version.  ",

            "review_text": "I think this is one of the first reviews I write about a game in steam. The reason I decided to write a review about Black Ops 3 is because of the amount of bad reviews I read before I bought the game and it made me wonder, what's the fuss about.  Ok, first off, I'm NOT a CoD fan, I have never bought a CoD before, I've only playd CoD - WaW that I installed from a friend to play zombies together at a LAN party and also just a little bit of Black Ops 2 with a gaming console at work (and I hate console gaming). Black Ops 3 is the first CoD that I have bought after spending hours and hours reading reviews and still doubting, I eventually took the risk - I have to say, I am not disappointed.  So, about the game:  Campaign 8/10- I'm suprised how everyone is whining about the campaign sucks?! The campaign was completely enjoyable experience, at least from the gameplay side. I do not usually focus on following the story and the background of it so deeply because hey, I'm not reading a book, right? The gameplay was well made, with varience in environments, style and targets. I playd it on Hardened mode so it offered several challenges as well and was not a completely easy playthrough. To my great suprise, after finishing the campaign, I was thrown a candy by Black Ops 3 with an additional gamemode that I enjoyed even more (not going into further detail here due to not wanting to spoil the experience for others).  Multiplayer 7/10- Now I bought multiplayer beta access with the expectation that I could try out the Zombies mode, because buying Black Ops 3 was twirling in my mind just because of the Zombies mode, again to get that going with my mates on LAN parties. Unfortunately Zombies was not available in Beta so I had to try out the Multiplayer. At that time, I was really pessimistic about the multiplayer as I didn't really like all that wallrunning and jet-thrusters (they completely 'DIDN'T' get that idea from Titanfall... Not one gramm =D ) with all those futuristic weapons and all. However, after the Beta, it seems (I might be wrong, because I didnt play Beta Multiplayer for extensive periods) they reconfigured and optimized the Multiplayer gameplay, and right now the more I play the Multiplayer, the more I start to embrace it and like it. It does get a bit repetitive, with the small amounts of maps and people being generally gathered into only 2-3 gamemodes, but what keeps one going, is the ability to unlock more specialists, perks and weapons etc. Hopefully in 2016, with the season pass, they will get some decent amounts of maps into the game.  Zombies 8/10 - Now this is the bomb, thats what I came into the game. I was a bit disappointed for the game having only 1 zombie map with the core game, even though the map should be HUGE as everyone talks (I havent gotten even near to completing it). I didn't like the octopus thingie at first at all, kinda hated it even, but as soon as I got to understand what you can do with it, and what is its main purpose, I realised that it will not so greatly affect the 'core' zombie mod style playing. In addition to that, I bought the season pass to get THE GIANT map, which I liked from CoD - WaW, and got to play some old-school zombie shooting which I really liked. Playing the map again with beautiful graphics (everything maxed) creates a completely new experience and I love it. As I read from the internet, Activision has already accepted to bring modding and map creation into Black Ops 3 - this is a f**king amazing news as it allows the brilliant map-makers to create new custom tailored maps for Zombies mode, just like in WaW, and I JUST CANT WAIT to play all those awesome new zombie massacre awesomenesses =)).  All in all, the game is really well optimized, runs smoothly (except for some cutscenes in the campaign), the gameplay is great. I am really happy with the purchase and I do not regret it at all.  I truly believe, that the people who gave this game a thumbs down without really justifying their opinion, are simply lonely grumpy nerds that outlive their anger for the world towards a great game, and do not have anything else to do in life. To those guys I want to say: You need to jack off more... It helps...",

Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

Also the sensitivities are false, horizontal is good, but it semi-locks and when you go to aim up/diagonal it jumps, as I said, it feels like it locks to horizontal, and then realises it needs to go up and shoots upwards, also it's near impossible to quickscope with controller, because the aim assist conveniently turns off. =-Graphics? I have minecraft shadows everywhere, big squares (multiplayer only however). =-Huge FPS drops and severe stuttering, in campaign/zombies. (90+ FPS, enter an area, and suddenly its 15FPS, campaign needs proper loading sequences, at the moment it loads and rendrs maps at random times and I have to pause for about 30 seconds, then resume, and it's normal). =-Massive Memory Leak. I have 8gb (2x4gb) and it maxxed my RAM out completely, it then proceeded to kill my Hard Drive due to overloading the Page Filing/ Virtual Memory. (Had to buy a new hard drive). =-I don't think there's a single person not NAT: MODERATE (may be wrong, but I doubt that I am). =-Buggy to join friends lobbies/games. =-Crazy pings, one second your 100, the next your 350. =-Mouse seems to track players with a very soft lock-on. =-4K seemed to increase saturation and sharpness too much, made my eyes hurt after 13 minutes. =-Seems to like putting prestiged players in a lobby of level 5-20, or vice versa. =-HayMaker Shotgun is way too OP, it needs a de-buff of some sort, it's extremely difficult to kill someone who has it, almost impossible for a lot of people. (most other guns are averagely balanced). =-Weapon kick (when getting shot) is a little too powerful. =-Black screens. =-Freezes. =-Blue screens at end of the majority of Multiplayer matches, during the transition between endgame and lobby. =-Only 1 zombies map (obviously season pass adds more) not really a con but it's a bit poor. =-No NUK3TOWN map unless certain game versions purchased. This is wrong, as black ops is built on the standards of nuketown. =-CAN'T SKIP A LOT OF THE LONG CUTSCENES AND IT'S REALLY IRRITATING, ESPECIALLY THE GAME LAUNCH CINEMATIC!  Rant over, I prefer the beta, (for multiplayer obviously). Bit annoyed because this game was pretty expensive.   Overall: Bring back the beta, with all weaponry and customisations unlocked. (For people who want to play it such as myself, maybe do a community vote to see who wants it), and don't try to fix anything. (except maybe fix the mouse issues that were in it for kb/m users, but everything else was fine AKA controller support). And run it on a seperate server system (obviously).  Regardless I recommend it, as obviously it is going to get better. In future I'm going to stick with my theory: always wait a month till purchase, to see how the game goes. ",

This is because I bought the game for zombies and ended finding out there's no way to get the giant unless I pay for the season pass. Which is pretty much like walking into mcdonalds only wanting french fries,but they say you can't get the french fries without ordering a number 1. Meaning you end up paying 6-8 bucks for a purchase which should be 2 or 3 at most by itself.  Oh and the big mac will not be ready for an hour.

The multiplayer is perfect standalone and this kind of deal is exactly what i wanted, yes I dont get zombies or any of that crap but I don't really care, the multiplayer is what I always liked and what I was mainly interested in on blops 3, the game being 60 didnt justify a purchase given my level of interest especially since I havent played cod recently since the jetpacks came in. The last cod I owned was ghosts and i was very disapointed with that especially since I got the ps3 version since I was poor, so this is a good way to give me a sample I can actually play for a while to make sure my interest in it isn't the equivalent of a skinners box addiction fad. Given this current deal what my aim is is to just upgrade later on when theres another sale since I lack money right now.    The game itself as far as multiplayer goes, it's wonderfull. It's a simple arena shooter with a good movement system that you can pour a lot of time into.(Please note, I am not saying simplicity itself is good, if this got any more simple I'd have a problem.

When I first played the game all seemed kinda new and exciting, however once i got to the first prestige and played through all the weapons (I played every weapon to at least level 5 to gain a first impression) I noticed how the gunplay compared to black ops 2 isn't, what it used to be. All the rifles submachine guns and shotguns just don't feel as they did in black ops 2. Whatever damage they do or if they're burst or not, they just feel strange. The snipers and lmgs on the otherside are handled better in bo3 than in bo2. I played bo2 for a long time, but never really got into sniping and the lmgs just felt week to me but in bo3 sniping is overall more enjoyable and lmg finally seem to play a significant role in multiplayer. Concerning the new added specialist, I personally think they are unnecessary, since everyone gets they're special ability at some point in every match and weapons like the flamethrower from the last unlocked specialist are hugely unbalanced and more or less result in 0-4+ free kills once activated. So in the end if you are like me going from bo2 to bo3 because of the amount players in the first one hast drastically decreased I would not recommend the game because you are just not getting as good as a gunplay as in bo2.",

            "review_text": "My teammate's in game character congratulated me when I leveled up.  He then killed me with a lightning strike a few minutes later.  This game is poorly optimized, not all the time, but in certain parts of maps or when different events happen etc. When the game is not in one of these states, it runs very well. Now it runs well on high end gaming PCs. I can say that when I played the beta, I was running a GTX 570 and couldnt play the game at minimal settings. Now I have a 980 TI and it runs how any game ever should run on that kind of card.   The playerbase isn't your average COD playerbase. The community is smaller because of the limitations on who can actually run the game and the fact that COD isn't as big on the PC (as CSGO or TF2 etc). This means not many squakers. The hardcore community is even more compact. I mainly stick to hardcore and will regularly see the same dedicated players and little relationships have formed over that. The guns feel solid with attachments and feel a little wonky without, which is great because the attachments actually drastically improve the performance of the gun with each level up. The attachments are pretty much the same as BO2 and all modern shooters but that is more because of what is acceptable and usable on modern day weapons so that isn't much of a gripe. There is noticibly more shake/movement on sights like the reflex. I enjoy this because most shooters put huge shake on snipers and then have a static sight on all other kinds of weapons. There are some new ideas here with guns. For instance, a three round burst laser sniper rifle (which has to be charged) and a seven round burst LMG.   The maps are more focused on player channeling rather than an open map. There are certain paths you can go which lead to a certain place and you cant really take shortcuts or get there by jumping over a wall or something. It is nice because you sort of know where the enimies will generally be and you dont have to worry about some dude perched in the trees somewhere random. But this limits snipers very greatly. There arent mant open areas where snipers can be effective. If you're playing hardcore, you're gonna need a fully automatic.   The specialist system is great. Well the idea is great. There are nine specialists with two abilities each. This makes for eighteen different play styles. They are varied greatly and provide definite buffs which apply to different situations. You can level up your specialist for more armour and camos and eventually unlock sound bytes that tell you about their past. There are definetly some specialists that are more viable in certain game modes and in general, but some tweaking can fix that. I would like to see new specialists in the future though (like R6S).  The Black Market system is really nice. You open up cases (which has become a gaming norm) and get three items varying in rarity. These items can be weapon skins, varients to weapon attachments (which are only cosmetic I think), calling cards and emblems, shapes or textures for custom skins or emblems, specialist armour camo, specialist taunts, and brand new weapons that are only available via random drop in the black market. This system is very balanced. For 10 cryptokeys, you can unbox a common crate with more of a chance to get common or uncommon items. For 30 cryptokeys, you can unbox a rare case that has more of a chance for rare items. Cryptokeys are only available by playing the game. You will get at least one or one and a half cryptokeys per match and if you do well, you may get three or more.   Overall, I wish there were more maps and specialists but this game is one of the best, if not the best, Call of Duty games I have played.",

REAL GUNS? well forget it cause here u have a bunch of anime like 'specialists runnin around like clowns holding axes swords baseball bats or simply just with fists. yes u heard me, BASEBALL BATS AND FISTS.i remembered playing MW games and love them. now i get the futuristic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and a poorly optimized game. loved the previous games but now i just want this to reach it's braindead and finish this cod futuristic joke and return back to modern warfare like cods.better save ur 60 euros for, if u like fast paced games, doom or even the PREVIOUS CODS. yes believe me they have more active community that this one. As for the zombies i can say i loved them and this is where most of my hours are into. overall.  campaign 3/10 just be like 'HEY WHO CARES ABOUT STORY LET'S JUST PUT STH OVER THERE WITH THE WORDS CAMPAIGN AND LET EM PLAY IT EZ PZ. multiplayer 6/10 despite the poor optimization and unbalanced ♥♥♥♥. the multiplayer is trying to help this game not to die but after the blackmarket thing it just ♥♥♥♥ed ♥♥♥♥ up. zombies 9/10 rly great mode. the only thing worth in this game.

            "review_text": "  ABOUT THIS GAME  Treyarch, developer of the two most-played games in Call of Duty® history, returns with Call of Duty®: Black Ops III. For the first time with three-years of development, the revered, award-winning studio has created its first title for next-gen hardware in the critically acclaimed Black Ops series. Welcome to Call of Duty: Black Ops 3, a dark, twisted future where a new breed of Black Ops soldier emerges and the lines are blurred between our own humanity and the technology we created to stay ahead, in a world where cutting-edge military robotics define warfare.   Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 combines three unique game modes: Campaign, Multiplayer and Zombies, providing fans with the deepest and most ambitious Call of Duty ever. The Campaign has been designed as a co-op game that can be played with up to 4 players online or as a solo cinematic thrill-ride. Multiplayer will be the franchise’s deepest, most rewarding and most engaging to date, with new ways to rank up, customize, and gear up for battle. And Zombies delivers an all-new mind-blowing experience with its own dedicated narrative. Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 can be played entirely online, and for the first time each of the offerings has its own unique player XP and progression systems. The title ushers in an unprecedented level of innovation, including jaw-dropping environments, never before experienced weaponry and abilities, and the introduction of a new, improved fluid movement system. All of this is brought to life by advanced technology custom crafted for this title, including new AI and animation systems, and graphics that redefine the standards Call of Duty fans have come to expect from the critically-acclaimed series, with cutting edge lighting systems and visual effects. INTRODUCING A NEW ERA OF BLACK OPS: Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 deploys its players into a future where bio-technology has enabled a new breed of Black Ops soldier. Players are now always on and always connected to the intelligence grid and their fellow operatives during battle. In a world more divided than ever, this elite squad consists of men and women who have enhanced their combat capabilities to fight faster, stronger, and smarter. Every soldier has to make difficult decisions and visit dark places in this engaging, gritty narrative. A CALL OF DUTY CAMPAIGN UNLIKE ANYTHING BEFORE IT: Treyarch elevates the Call of Duty social gaming experience by delivering a campaign with the ability to play cooperatively with up to four players online, using the same battle-tested network infrastructure and social systems that support its world-class Multiplayer and Zombies game modes. Designed for co-op and re-playability, players encounter all the epic cinematic gameplay moments Call of Duty is known for delivering as well as new open-area arena-style gameplay elements designed to allow players to approach the game with a different strategy each time they play. And now, every player is completely customizable: from weapons and loadouts, to abilities and outfits, all with full progression systems and a personalized armory to show off accomplishments, providing a constantly-evolving campaign experience. PREPARE FOR A LEVELED-UP MULTIPLAYER: With Black Ops 3, Treyarch premieres a new momentum-based chained-movement system, allowing players to fluidly move through the environment with finesse, using controlled thrust jumps, slides, and mantling abilities in a multitude of combinations, all while maintaining complete control over your weapon at all times. Maps are designed from the ground-up for the new movement system, allowing players to be successful with traditional movement, as well as advanced tactics and maneuvers.  Black Ops 3 multiplayer also introduces the new Specialist character system, which allows players to rank up and master each specific character’s battle-hardened capabilities and weapons. With this addition to Traditional and Weapons XP progressions systems, Black Ops 3 multiplayer gives players three different ways to rank up. FIGHT THE UNDEAD IN AN ALL-NEW HORROR STORY: No Treyarch title would be complete without its signature Zombies offering – a full-game experience with its own distinct storyline right out of the box. Black Ops 3 Zombies is the most immersive and ambitious Call of Duty Zombies to date, with a full XP-based progression system for players that adds depth and re-playability to the engaging gameplay Zombies fans have come to expect.   Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 delivers the ultimate 3-games-in-1 experience.",

The only antialiasing option during sli is SMAA, and FXAA I believe.

Shouldn't be a problem playing on European servers, just prepare for some lag. The matches that end up working are addicting, so when the game works, it truly works.  Zombies is different, to say the least. There's a lot more to every map, even turning on the power can prove to be a challenge. If you've played previous installments, you won't find it too overwhelming, though.  The promised Mod tools are in Beta as I'm writing this, and seem to have gathered as big of a community around them as World at War did. There's a few maps out on testing stage already.

With bo3, good freaking luck. Bottom line, Treyarch said they cared about PC players. That's a freaking lie. I have an i7 processor and gtx 970. I should have NO issues running this game, and yet, at times the issues are just so overwhelming. I mean why would a game require you to max your settings out to run like trash still.

EDIT : HOPEFULLY, they will do a good job on the DLCs but seeing as they already announced the first one december 8th, they are definetly rushing it out, it will definetly not be good quality, I don't know that for sure. Also nightmares, it isn't a big part of the game, but they did not do a good job, took the same maps, replaced the people with zombies, made your character have a different voice and new cutscenes. Dead ops arcade 2 is fun, definetly with all the new maps in it and first person is really cool. Hopefully they will do a good job in the future DLCs",

As I am a zombies fan all the way back to World at War, so immediately after fiddling with the graphics settings I went on to play Zombies, which looked nice until I discovered I could not move or shoot, only able to look around. This repeated every attempt until I restarted the game TWICE (with it also causing my whole system to lag and for some reason using almost 100% of my processing power [Intel i7 3770k]). So after sorting that out I found myself not playing Call of Duty Zombies, but Lag Simulator 2015, it was so ♥♥♥♥ing unplayable, I then decided to change my graphics settings, sure it made my FPS go up but the stuttering? Nope.  So after trying and failing to be able to play zombies properly, with also constant server disconnections, I went on to play Single Player.  Holy ♥♥♥♥ that was even worse.  I literally spent 9 minutes unable to move or do anything with my game stuttering, even in the ♥♥♥♥ing cutscenes, this of course persisted to every level, and anytime I went into a new area I was greated with MORE FPS DROPS. I officially gave up on single player entirely as it was so poor in performance.  I later was able to somewhat zombies after several retries and sure its kinda fun solo, but that's all I can do on this game right now and that is quite frankly not what I paid for.  This game was easily a highly promising game but was absolutely destroyed by terrible optimization.  And if you're looking for help from Activision forget it, they're about as useful as a spider is for masturbating to.  1/10 would not recommend to anyone ever or any future CoD Title until they get their ♥♥♥♥ together and fix the current issues, but I doubt they will.

            "review_text": "Ok so with this game, you get 3 modes, campaign, multiplayer and zombies:   Campaign: Great fun and looks great on PC in terms of textures when compared with the PS4 console version, though not record breaking graphics but in my opionion a solid 8/10. Fun shooter that's fairly linear but is more of a positive as it plays well and has a really deep story that has good replayability with the capability to rank up weapons and power cores (basially abilities that can be used in combat, personally I love them). Missons are overall really fun and intense, my personal favourite is 'Vengence', a tense sniping mission with a beautiful dark red/orange colour scheme and vibe. I loved the story as it really got me thinking, Blundell did a fantastic job in my opinion. I know it's futuristic (which a lot of people aren't too big on but Treyarch pulled it off so well). Overall, after playing all the campaigns of previous call of dutys, I'd give this an 8 out of 10, with world at war being 9/10 (for comparision) so not too shabby. Also throw in nightmares, combat immersion and free run and you get a significant increase in content whem compared with other Call of duty's.   Multiplayer: Right off the bat it has that addictiveness that is consistent throughout all call of duties. Not big on the chain movement system but it is pretty fun when wall running I must admit. Same old other than that with the prestiging and perks and killstreaks etc. Although the specialists really do change up the formula in a great way. Maps are 3 lane designs and overall are balanced and cool and bright. Some solid AR's and SMG's and cool snipers make multiplayer great fun, I've just fallen out of love with it as of late due to lack of lobbies on PC, which makes me have to give it a 6 (on console it would only be 7/10, got it for both lol). Only my opinion though, it really does have the Treyarch multiplayer feel as with black ops 1 and 2.    Zombies: Ok, now this is where Treyarch plays their trump card. Guys...zombies is the sh*t. Standard map included is shadows of evil and the vibe and replayability is really astonishing. It really is so addictive and super fun. The DLC's add so much to the table and makes for an unforgettable experinece in terms of gameplay innovation and story depth. Packed full of cool things to do with each map and a cool ranking system and weapon kits. Also comes with a brillaint community of people, see r/CDz. For me, best zombies yet, although infinte warfare zombies looks like its going to bang in November, regardless though, 10/10 for me. Also, custom zombies coming soon will be madness, another big reason to get involved with zombies right now. Honestly, you will fall in love.    So, in conculsion, is it worth the money, well, for campaign and zombies, yes yes yes, nothing more to say, proof is in the pudding. For multiplayer alone though, not for me, not on this platform anyway, but with Treyarch you know it's going to have a great vibe no mattter which mode. A call of duty that delivered, but with the threat of battlefield 1 this fall, could this be an honarbale sign off? Maybe not, but zombies is a major part of the franchise keeping it alive right now in my personal opinion and a new unique selling point is needed.    Danny.",

This rig has absolutely no problems running Battlefield 4 at stable 144fps at lowest settings. I prefer low settings and high FPS because of performance and best visibility. Black Ops 3 though... I immediately changed every setting to absolute minimum. I only had my screen res and render res at max or '100%', 1080p. Surely if I can run BF4 at 144fps with ease, I can run BO3 even better right? Hell no. I set my framerate limit to 80 because of the mouse inputlag problems, which amazingly seems to have been 'fixed' since the beta. I'm not extremely happy with 80fps but if it eliminates the mouse problem, I can deal with it. But then I had to shoot, or do pretty much anything, or see anything and BAM! My FPS dropped to 40-something which obviously is completely unplayable and unacceptable. Then there was some random FPS drops too when I didn't do anything at all. Sometimes the FPS just drops from 80 to 60 for no reason.  A game with a lot of potential to be very good completely wasted because of extremely bad optimization. Good thing I tested this game in Free Weekend and didn't pay anything for this.  TL;DR This game would have been good but it runs so badly that it's unplayable.

The 'Merc' specific abilities mixing up the cake is a good addition, coupled with myriad of ways to customize your character and gameplay. Just getting the unlock tokens and lack of 'trying out' certain weapon right off the bat does harm a bit. Less experimentation.  I wouldn't recommend this in its current state. The horrible connection issues and performance hiccups make this game less enjoyable overall. It's a flip of a coin if you get good host, but seems you get the wrong end in most cases. I wouldn't mind a high ping, but the rubber-banding and stutters that teleport you around is abysmal. I personally tried with two different connections, 100/100 and 24/1 connection and both resulted in exact same symptoms. This coupled with cluttered UI meant for consoles, rather small amount of maps makes this a no go. Due to me playing in free-weekend, I can't touch on the single player nor the zombie mode, propably the good parts of this game.  If treyarch can iron out the kinks, with less of a price tag, it should be a no brainer. But currently its way too high price for a twitch-shooter with less than stellar performance.

A lowly made horror movie like experience where things suddenly pop up and try to scare you. And 'zombie' robots, then fake human soilders that suddenly appear on the battleground out of nowhere. And then actual zombies! I'm not a big fan of zombie stuff but if I wanted to kill zombies I'd go play left for dead.

The last COD I consistently played was Black Ops 1. I was fairly happy with the game as the zombies were satifying. But now to the point, what i think. Early in the release I would have some serious FPS drops. This problem has been fixed as of now and that was really the only problem I have experienced besides small connection issues every now and then. I haven't really played the campaign much so i dont have an opinion on that. Now, for the multiplayer. Multiplayer has been the center of COD games for me, as i usually never touch the campaign. When i first got on Multiplayer, it had a HUGE learning curve as i had never played an FPS on PC, this was expected. The weapons in the game at first seemed fine as everybody was a reasonably low level (As of 11/9/15). I am now a first prestige level 21 and I have come to realize that some guns are in my opinion, are out of control. Guns I am mentioning are the; Haymaker, Gorgon and Drakon. If I had to put them in order from the most OP;   1: Drakon 2/3: Gorgon/Haymaker  Now don't get me wrong, I'm not the best but walking around a corner and getting blown away within about 2 feet of walking around seems a little ridiculous. Now camping with the Drakon doesen't help the cause but it's little to no recoil with rapid ROF is unbeatable. I would like to see some changes made to this but treyarch can do what they want, my K/D will just keep dropping to the Drakon   I did not play AW but from the things i have heard, it didn't seem very enjoyable. Coming from BO1, In around Vietnam, switching to 2063 was a leap to say the least. In my opinion, the wall running and jumping is balanced perfectly as it takes time for your jets to recharge. The speed of the Multiplayer gameplay seems just right, not to slow, yet not too fast.   Now Zombies, it's mediocre, I am not a fan of having to do all the things just to PAP but I'm a traditional Zombies player.  Zombies: 8/10 Multiplayer: 9.1/10 Campaign: N/A  Thanks for reading, I would like to hear your opinion also. Add me if you want to play sometime, Zombies MP, anything!",

            "review_text": "I can’t recommend this game at all really.  To be clear, I did buy the game for Zombies.  The story, seemed wacky, and well really pointless.   Multiplayer:  What I wanted: A mix between black ops, and black ops two, somewhere in there would have been perfect.   Issues with this game: Control- The control feels…weird I guess is one way to say it. It feels like the movement would almost be better done with a controller which isn’t a good thing in my opinion for a pc game. I’ve went back and played Waw, Blackops, Blackops 2, and now this game, and None of those games seem to have any sensitivity discrepancies but this game just feels off.   Stale weapons- The weapons are obviously just reskins of earlier black ops games, good reskins, but the performance of the weapons seems to be the same going all the way back to your Blackops.   Augmentations- I could leave these out entirely. I hated commando pro back in MW2, and I hate the class that gets it now. Halo does a much better job of doing high jumps, and thrusters, this game feels clunky.   Other issues: The matchmaking doesn’t seem to work at all with this game. It can take a long time to find a match. And there is no classic mode that I can see!   Zombies: The bad: Only one map included with the game.   Matchmaking again takes forever.   Mourg City level is just…not my favorite, I guess.   The good: The Giant was Cheap! No augmentation suits! Good, Vanillaish Zombie fun with just enough new added in!  Bottom line: I’m disappointed the game didn’t stay closer to Black ops 2 in terms of timeframe. It did enhancement suits worse than advanced warfare, Matchmaking and optimization seem to be lacking.   The zombie mode seems promising, as always! (Why isn't this its own game yet?) ",

MULTIPLAYER: One of the worst experiences I've ever had. Awful spawning, starting weapons seem to be underpowered and I have never met anyone under rank 30 in this game yet.  ZOMBIES: I find it really fun most times (if you have other players that actually revive you) even though it is just 1 huge map.  GRAPHICS &amp; PERFORMANCE: The graphics are an 8/10 for me. (I run at ultra 1080p) but I get some stuttering every so often with dips down to 40 fps, which lasts for about a second, but this rarely ever happens. I always keep 60+ fps on max and average around 110 fps.  When I first downloaded the game I did have an issue where it kept freezing at start-up and I had to run as admin which seemed to fix it, and now it works fine.  CONTROLS &amp; OPTIONS: There is a good amount of options in the game, including a FoV slider (upto 120), render resolution, a good choice of AA and other things. The audio menu features seperate sliders for Master, Voice, Music and SFX as well as an Audio Preset option (Bass Boost, High Boost, etc) There is also a graphic content filter if you need it for some reason. The controls are fine as well, shift to sprint, X to switch weapons, mouse to aim / fire, same as most other FPS.  CONCLUSION: It's a decent game if you want to play Campaign or Zombies, but Multiplayer sux If you want this game, buy it from a key site or wait till a Steam sale is on, this game is definatly not worth full price.  EDIT: I can no longer launch the game, it freezes at launch then won't close.",

Ah, who cares).  The single player is ♥♥♥♥ as always so there isn't much to say about that. You will be pitted against hordes of robots and other androids that will foolishly try to attack you and your friends as you use overpowered abilities and guns to massacre them. It is made even easier by the fact that you are armed with built in wall hacks which will tell you the locations of enemies, and show you grenades. It seems that the story mode was made entirely with coop in mind, the stages offer various routes to take, and it even allows you to skip to the last mission without playing any other missions prior. This may be a good thing for some people, but I think the majority just want to go online and shoot some kids and/or zombies.  Standard online is great. The guns are balanced, though I'm sure many people will disagree with me here. It seems people still don't understand that shotguns have to be one-shot kills, or they would be useless in a firefight where the enemy can quickly dash out of range with their boostpack. The game modes are lackluster with some household favourites such as Sabotage being completely removed from the roster. The map pool also seems truncated, with many matches being the same map over and over again leading to fatigue very quickly. Hopefully DLC will remedy this, though I strongly think it should have had more to start with. As always cosmetics and levelling is a big part of online play, now more so than ever. An ingame shop allows players to redeem 'crypto keys', a currency that is obtained every match. These can be used to open one of two crates, either a common crate which is cheaper, or a rare crate which obviously is more costly. Opening either of these will reward the player with exclusive skins and attachment variants only available from these crates. Following a recent update, you can now pay real money to open these crates. This isn't pay2win at all, so I don't care in the slightest.  The zombies gamemode has taken a completely new turn down a very mafia inspired road. A new story driven map with new characters and monsters adds an incredible amount of variety when compared to the previous zombie maps Treyarch have released. As usual there is a lot to do when playing, and in this new map there is more than ever to find and explore. Infact, in my 100 hours of playing the game I have yet to open the PackaPunch! Trust me, if you love zombies, then you need to pick this game up. Even with a good team, it will take countless attempts to get to the 'end' of this first map.  The standard of the port isn't great. It is incredibly hard to run, even with a high end rig. Users who do not own a high end machine will find trouble running this game at stable fps without it looking like a last gen console game. Infact, my rig can barely run it maxed out at 144fps. It is sickening that they released this without maybe pushing the release back in order to optimise it further. But as we've come to expect, and accept. Activision don't care about PC players, so who cares right?  Many people will complain about this game receiving positive reviews. If i was to look to this game by itself, I would hate it. But after years of CODs, I've come to accept that they won't be released as finished games. DLC is a thing, and always will be, especially in COD. So yeah, the game is solid gameplay wise, but the port condition is truly terrible. As always be aware that most content will be coming out in the form of DLC packs later this year  Do I recommend? No. If you have a really good pc, then maybe check it out. But I would highly suggest buying it off a 3rd party Steam key seller such as Kin-guin. This game really isn't worth such a high price tag.",

            "review_text": "REVISION 9/29/16 - Upon the mod tools release, and several patches later, several things have changed. That said, I still wouldn't reccomend the game, at least not on PC with the size of the community being what it is. With that in mind, the following additions, fixes, and even new issues are outlined below, above the original review, which will remain unaltered.  -Several weapons, skins, animations, etcetera have been added for free into the multiplayer Supply Drop system, which I did not mention in detail in the original review. Essentially, keep playing to build up Cryptokeys, use either 10 Cryptokeys if you feel like wasting them, or 30 if you feel like having a slight chance at anything interesting or useful. Honestly, the system itself is quite populated with content, as there are hundreds of victory animations and skins. The issues, though lie a little further beneath. See, these crates are the only way to get the new weapons, minus the one or two melee weapons that have been made free and instantly given to all players (only the boxing gloves come to mind). There are 'weapon slips' or something like that which gurantee a weapon drop but the process is still entirely random, and chances are you'll end up getting one of the ~10 reskins of the combat knife instead of one of the far more interesting firearms, like the MX Garand which is a better Shieva, or the Double Barrel Sniper Rifle, or the 3 round ballistic crossbow whatever the hell. Point is, system is good in theory but broken as hell and not a fun process to wade through. Cryptokeys aren't hard to earn, but they're slow to build if you play more casually, and you'll likely never see most of the new weapons in your own armory. Did I mention the microtranaction-only currency they added specifically for this? No? Well what the ♥♥♥♥ do you think I have to say about that?  -Mod tools dropped yesterday, and the new CoD game is about a month and a half out. Great timing Treyarch. That said, it seems to have a similar degree of freedom to what CoD4 and W@W had in their mods (you could have guns from Ghosts and AW in a W@W Zombies map for example), so that much is quite nice to see. Honestly, if this pans out, it could honestly be a selling point all it's own just for Custom zombies. ALthough keep in mind that the choice you have is 'buy W@W for ~$15 for tons of completed, excellent, fine-tuned maps' or 'buy this $60 game now and wait for the maps to trickle down, if they ever actually do'. I'd wait on it before making a descision here.  -For those of you with performance issues around the release of the game, those have largely been remedied, but the game still looks like trash to be completely honest. I don't know what was wrong with the old methods of rendering in the pre-Ghosts days, BO2 even being a partial offender. I can boot up any of those games and actually identify targets in the distance because the character models don't just belnd in with the background. Maybe my eyes have started to fial me in the ripe old age of 20 but something just ain't right with BO3's visuals, and you still need a bit of a tank to run it even on medium settings.  -DLC maps look interesting, but I'm not paying for that ♥♥♥♥, and you likely haven't/won't, so who really cares? I'm not paying a game's price a second time over for some new maps, and if you do, you're an idiot. I don't care if you're supporting the devs or if 'it's just $15', you're still an idiot. 5 maps does not equate to 25% of the original content that the game has in it's vanilla form.   EVER.  Not much more to be said. Various different balances, various new imbalances, half the gamemodes are still completely dead in playercount and will never be revived, and that guy who slaps the Thermal scope on the LMG is still playing and he's still a prick. At this point I'd say BO3 is about in it's final form here, what with Infinite Warfare right around the corner. Overall I'd say the experience still isn't worth it for what they're charging. Think about it like this:  You can buy almost any other CoD game that's been released in the past, and they'll run better, look sharper, play tighter, and probably be more fun, for FAR less money. I have a bit of advice for Treyarch, and every dev for that matter; When you try to do this, release a new iteration of the same game every year? Or even a sequal in general (looking at you Civ) You may want to ensure that each installment is a step up from the previous, not a step sideways or in a 'whole new direction'. If I can go back to an older game and have more fun just because it's a better game, and pay less money for it, what reason do I have to take the plunge?  You are competing with free when you release a 'new' product into your installbase. You will be competing with yourself if you don't bring your A-Game, and here, you've more or less failed.  God willing IW will prove better, but at this point thigns look grim. Anyway, thats that.  =============== ORIGINAL REVIEW  Campaign - Its bad.  Nightmares - Basically Co-op zombies mode where you just walk in a straight line. Somehow manages to be worse than the actual campaign.  Zombies - Convoluted as all hell. Remember the days where you just turned on the power and shot zombies? Now there's a laundry list of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t you have to do just to get Pack-A-Punch. Unless you preordered, of course. Then you get Der Riese HD Edition, which should've been ♥♥♥♥ing free.  Multiplayer - CoD MP hasn't been good since World at War, and has had varying levels of playablility since MW2. This is neither good nor playable, especially if you like objective gamemodes. However, if you like 'chalk up the kills you get' mode, or 'launch every piece of ordinance the United States has at the stupid flags' mode, then you'll be happy to know that those are the only two populated game modes on PC. What a joke.  Season Pass - This should be illegal.  CoD Points - Remember that $60 you paid for the game? Yeah, and the $40 you paid for the season pass on top of it? Well thats still not enough, sorry to say. Oh, but don't worry - you don't HAVE to buy CoD Points for worthless as ♥♥♥♥ virtual skins, you can just 10-15 games for enough cryptokeys to get the only worthwhile case worth opening. And we'll even give you 3 cryptokeys back because you're so paitent. Aren't we just the best?  Graphics - Pukeworthy. In the face of games like The Witcher, which had a far inferior budget compared to CoD, there's no reason for a AAA title to have such disgusting visuals.  Audio - Treyarch has a knack for making firearms sound like airsoft. They didn't dissappoint this year, either.  Jetpacks - 'Hey Paul', 'Yes, John?', 'Howsabout we put a walkway over here on the map?', 'We could do that, OR we could add jetpacks to every player and put up a not-at-all-obvious wallrunning wall which has literally no purpose from an environmental design standpoint, and we could make their vision tilted and stuff and the wallrunning could be really slow so you become an easier target and - ', 'OR, we could just put a walkway there.', 'You're fired, John.'  Overall - I've paid a lot of money for ♥♥♥♥♥♥ video games over the years. This year alone I bought at least four $60 games that were average at best. This game is no exception. Wether you're looking for a campaign, multiplayer, co-op, or whatever, there's a game out there that does it FAR, FAR better, for a fraction of the price. For $45, the Christmas sale considered, you can get a whole bunch of games, all of which are miles better than this game. Throw in the Season Pass' price and you can even pick up Fallout, The Witcher, or anything else worth your time.",

I've nearly completed the campaign now (Haven't finished yet since I can play zombies.) Servers do take a few minutes to connect to since it isn't a hugely played game on steam because of competator games (Counter Strike).  Really nice community too. That is if you have the voice chat turned off. Other wise you'd most likely hear people complain and ♥♥♥♥♥ about you. But after quite some time playing multiplayer I've found out a lot of people actually use chat which leads me to believe not that many use voice chat or teamspeak. Also have voice enabled for zombie play because I've been getting into servers where people use mics and it's really nice. They don't spam either.  If you're a fan of COD or Titanfall for that matter pick this up and you won't be disapointed. It's a fresh take on the series and honestly I didn't have high expectations for it at all. To me the whole futuristic sorta theme COD has going on lately has been turning me away from the franchise but treyarch and activisions reputation has really been turned around with this latest installment in the series.  After the bust with Ghosts and Advanced Warfare this is a breath of fresh air and a really good buy for your money.  Definitly purchase the season pass too because the zombies is just spectacular.

If your not killed every round by a sniper, then your killed by someone who clearly spent enormous ammounts of money on the lottery boxes that give you unfair weapons and unfair advantages. I've spent over 100 dollars on the boxes myself - like a moron, only to receive a crowbar, and a few melee weapons, a very bad assault rifle, a slow firing world war 2 smg, and a sniper rifle that is nothing more then the one you can unlock for free. In the same way that I've spent money and have basically been given good weapons from the boxes - although not much better then what can be earned, I have spent my time in the game earning the normal points and purchasing the rare boxes with said points - I have noticed that when you earn the points your rewards are much smaller then when you pay for the boxes. It is very clearly and very evidently rigged for a pay 2 win system.  That out of the way, the multiplayer is attrocious. I went to multiplayer for a fast paced arena shooter with its black ops pulled over it. It's beyond bad when it comes to the community - they are the most toxic, skilless group of fps gamers I've ever seen in my fps days (coming from Quake 2-3, and Unreal Tournament all iterations) to modern gaming.   They will do anything to have an unfair advantage over other players, if you go into hardcore instead of refined gameplay with skill you find people who lay down with lmgs, guys who snipe the entire time, or guys who sit in corners waiting to spray you down. If you play non-hardcore you find the same copy/paste perk setup and favorite smg/assault rifle or shotgun/sniper set up as the guy next to them. There is hardly anyone trying to do something different.   On top of that the multiplayer attitude is toxic. Think League of Legends community's worst most toxic players x100.   The game has some positives but if your looking into getting into it, I suggest the multiplayer edition for 15 dollars and not upgrading beyond that. If you upgrade beyond that such as I did your given DLC that basically nobody plays unless they are playing Zombies. Some of the maps have been brought into the normal rotation but far more people play the standard levels and gameplay then their are games to be played with people with DLC. Its an upgrade I wish I hadn't spent.   The abilities you get in the game are fun for awhile. But very quickly you see the same exact characters every round because things like 'Super Speed' to not compare to things like 'Lock on melee' (that can lock on to you - mid air and sometimes can lock on to you from a good 20 feet). In addition to everyone's favorite the flamethrower which for some reason gets tripple the usage time of say the explosive arrow, the pistol, the lightning gun, and the proxminity mines gun. The flamethrower is obscene, no skill whatsoever needed, spray anywhere get kills. It sprays at a range of 30 meters +, and as long as someone is touched by it, their dead. I've even been touched by it, and jumped into water and have died to 'Being on fire' while in the water. Total bs weapon that makes every other specialist weapon completely useless outside of the lock on charge 20 meters melee.  So if your cool with broken specialist weapons, pay 2 win crates, and a toxic unskilled commmunity then this is the game for you.  Otherwise stay far away from this one, I'm suprised this isn't getting the negativity that Ghosts' got.  Let my hours be your guide.",

But instead of coming here and crying about it, I went to nVidia's website and downloaded the new drivers. And you know what? It worked.  The game still has some big performance issues (I'm playing the campaign with Opt. Settings and the fps sometimes drop below 30). The multiplayer is often laggy and it also has some performance issues. The zombies....I don't know. I've never enjoyed them so I don't care about that mode.  EVEN SO, this is probably the best COD campaign I've played since COD4. The story is a bit confusing just like the previews Black Ops games, but the levels are amazing and I just loved the pacing and the gameplay.   The multiplayer is quite good.. It's nothing original, but it's not bad.   In the first 10 hours of playing this, I've had more fun than I ever did with Ghosts and Advanced Warfare combined!  It's a good COD game.

Its Day 1 and they are really trying so hard to optimize this thing.  This game is getting a lot of backlash for not being optimized on a platform that is different to every user. Every computer will react differently to a game whether people like it or not. I personally found no issues whatsoever in terms of performance as it runs at a silky 60fps with gorgeous visuals.   As for the gameplay, I only got this CoD because I felt like visiting Call of Duty again along with the return of Zombies once more. I remember the days where the fast paced combat was fun in CoD's such as CoD 1 and 2. It's very funny how people will lash out on CoD and its developers; they really are not changing whats not broken.   If you desire fast paced combat that can be relieved in 10-15 minute bursts in a Team Deathmatch or Domination mode, get this game. If you desire fun with teammates in a Lore filled Zombies, get this game.  If you hate CoD because you think every year its the same game (it is), then dont get this game. Go get CS:GO and try to be the 10 percent that becomes professional. If you think CoD requires no skill, go purchase CS:GO and deal with the hackers that litter the game in higher ranks.   Conclusion: Buy this game if you want to pass time and have silly fun. These bursts help me relieve the cancer I get in DotA 2 and stress in life. I love to decompress with silly stupid games like this.  My specs:  AMD-8320fx 16gb DDR3 Ram GTX 970 650 Watt PSU MSI 970 Gaming Motherboard.  Runs fine.",

The multiplayer is great and one of the best since many years IF IT WORKS. At the current time me and my clan are experiencing some connection issues with the servers and many games are running with ridiculously high pings so everyone is porting around like a f*cking mage in World of Warcraft. If you get a nearly lag free game the multiplayer is fun as hell. But weapon balance need some work. MPs are totally overpowered and ARs are too weak. Thats mostly caused by the very small maps in this game so that most gun fights are in close range and you are nearly forced to use MPs on certain maps, otherwise you dont even stand a chance.   Zombie mode is fantastic in this game just like always in Black Ops. A big and great designed map with many objectives to do in order to survive. Bad thing: You have to level up your character to custimze your weapons for zombie mode. It would be better if you could just use your guns from MP because you have to spend a big amount of time to level up.  I havent played through the campaing yet but the missions i have done were very boring and i lost interest in the story real quick so i cant really give a statement about it.   All in one this is by far the best CoD since many years with a lot of content but it surely has its problems and issues and i hope that Treyarch cant sort them out, especially when it comes to multiplayer. I can still recommend this game. Its a lot of fun if you play with a big party of 5-6 people and dominate any online game.",

Humans. 2. Robots - basically humans, but no sense of self-preservation and they just run at you and die. 3. Bullet sponge 'immortals' that require emptying entire magazines before they die. 4. That stupid big robot where you fire at the torso until it drops it's shield, you fire a rocket, and you repeat four more times, while robots swarm your position. That same encounter is repeated at least NINE times in the singleplayer campaign.  There are other enemies that are used a couple of times (like the red thing that rolls on the ground and blows up and kills you instantly), but bullet-sponge enemies in FPS games are so 1999 and it was really lame to pair that with endless respawning - if I shoot something with a rocket, I want it to blow up the first time!  I might still play the multi, but don't get this for the single player campaign - COD: Advanced Warfare was so much better in that respect. ",

Zombies is even more fun than it used to be via the new gumball and double pack a punch mechanics.

Pros -Fun gunplay -Multiple Unlocks with no DLC to purchase certain weapons or skins(as of 11/23/15) -Interesting and fun campaign with an optional difficulty that makes me doubt if it was even playtested at certain points -Zombies   Cons -A season pass that costs $10.00 less than the game itself -Still some OP guns that hopefully will get nerfed in the future -Minor performance and graphical issues   As COD's go I'd say it's a 9/10 and to buy it and play online for 1 Hour and 55 Mins before deciding if you want to refund it.

It´s fun and I´ve always said that I love the CoD shooting mechanics, the new Specialist thing is great, and the parkour/Jetpack element is super fun, but I have one simple question... BUT WHY DO YOU DIE SO ♥♥♥♥ING FAST?  This has been going on since CoD 4, and it´s ♥♥♥♥ing annoying. Seriously, there´s no learning from your mistakes or what you did wrong, you always die so fast. And the game´s unforgiving if you don´t pick the pace, your dead, and that´s not really a good thing. (Also, saying 'git gud scrub' doesn´t change the fact that it´s annoying as Hell, and it really isn´t a valid argument.)  Did I mention 1 hit kill weapons, and a gun that 'simulates' wallhacks? Oh goody.  I´m glad to see CoD evolving and everything, but the fact that I can´t enjoy it 100% because I die so fast really makes me not want to play .And of course I want to get good at it, but the fact that I shoot a dude like 3 times and didn´t die, but he shoots me 1 time with a standard rifle in the chest and I die is frustrating.  And even then, if you´re not good, you´re not gonna be able to use Killstreaks or Scorestreaks, wich makes you playing the game even worse when a guy uses the drones and other stuff.  Maybe if they gave you armor and if you didn´t die with 3 shots to the chest I wouldn´t be so pessimistic, but then again, that would destroy the core game.  Anyways, it´s really well optimized. I can play it on 30 FPS on my laptop and it feels 60 FPS-ish, wich is great.  I honestly want to give it a good review because Treyarch did a fantastic job, but it´s so unbalanced and unfair that I just don´t really want to play the game.  As of right now, I can´t recommmend it to people that want a fair and balanced FPS, other than that, it´s really good and fun for a CoD game.  7/10",

Right now you're pretty limited to Team Death match, and Domination. I hate TDM, so I've only ever been able to play Domination so far.  Honestly though, it's easily my fav COD yet. I truly hope the PC pop picks back up, and people give it a real chance. I love every little addition, slides, wall running, all smooth, the guns and mods are what you would expect. The leveling grind has become more difficult but it is far more interesting and rewarding. You really feel like your hard work pays off, without it being too difficult. Specializing, and the added cosmetics really allow you to make your charactor your own. On that note I also love that I can easily earn coins to buy black market chests, and don't really feel like I need to spend an extra dime to really enjoy that aspect of the game. Prices are also what one would expect.   It really blows my mind multiplayer is not a lot more popular. Just from an FPS stand point, this game really has it all and then some.  From what I've heard from friends, people love Zombies so much they buy it for just that. I've also only heard good reviews about the campaign. Not my thing...  I think there is some COD hate thats always been around, or grown in some people, but those holding back for bias reasons are really missing out on something pretty great.",

The movement options are really nice and slick, definitely makes this one of the most fast paced shooters I've played, alongside scout in TF2.

            "review_text": "Update: This is my first CoD Black Ops game and I'm not thrilled. I thought it would really be way better than the other games I played, but unfortunately it is far from that. Up until now I played over 400 hours in Coop and Multi Player mode and I can't say that it's a game I would recommend buying. Each time when you think that an update or patch will fix the issues, it's only getting worse... :( If you're the kind of player who likes brainless run-n-gunning in Multi, this might be the kind of game you're looking for. But be aware that you're also facing players who use a gamepad/controller which has aim assist and they are way faster than you and your mouse/keyboard. They'll kill you before you can even raise your weapon. The only way to beat them is by camping or prefiring... or start using a gamepad/controller as pc-gamer.  Multi can be alot of fun if you play it with people of which you are sure that they don't cheat because in Multi you'll see alot of players with sort of 'amazing skills'. Just like in any other game this game has his own bugs and issues which sometimes opens up opportunities for cheaters and hackers to annoy other players. More annoying however are the frequent disconnections, the lag people sometimes have to cope with and the fact that there is no f**cking option to setup your own server with your own admins.  Matchmaking is the only damn option the game offers to play online which forces you to play with higher ranked players and those who already know the maps like the back of their hands. So there is no way to select players of similar rank to play with or choose your own server to play on.  The higher ranked and better skilled players always have care packages and scorestreaks quite fast which makes it very hard or even impossible for other players to get them as well. So, either you're very good or a cheater and you get everything, or you're not so good or bad and you'll never get to use scorestreaks. Due to that stupid matchmaking it's nearly impossible to play other game modes than TDM and FreeForAll because not so many people like to play other (12) game modes. And if there are any, they won't find a server :(( Another annoying thing is that the Core and Hardcore mode servers are only for 12 players which means you can't bring a party with more than 6 players, so if you have more than 6 friends in your party, the others can't join you in the same game. Even if you are with 12 friends only for a friendly game. For that you can only create a Custom Game which doesn't allow you to rank up or level up your equipment. In Bonus you have the Groundwar mode for 18 players and that's the only mode to bring in a bigger party. This is also a game in which I noticed that bad language and lack of respect for others is just as ordinary as taking your daily dump.   You can earn cryptokeys and buy COD points to trade on the black market but the things you get in return are pretty much useless. Most of the camo patterns and calling cards you get from the black market are things you would give to a 5 year old. If you're lucky to get an attachement for a weapon it's mostly for a weapon you don't use. They said that there are new weapons and you could get them on the black market, but although I've spend all my cryptokeys (about 300) I still didn't get the new weapons..., turns out you only get them if you reach a certain level. What a crap! The new DLC maps are something like from Borderland and/or Loadout and 1 map is a remake from Black Ops 2. All maps are only for Multi and there is 1 new map for Zombies. NO new maps for Coop so in my opinion, the price for the season pass is a rip off and that's why not so many people want to buy the season pass. As for the weapons, most of them are crap. The configuration of power and accuracy seemed to be done by people who don't have a clue when it comes to guns. The ones that should have some power are under powered while some others are over powered. The accuracy is a big laugh which can be seen in the killcam..., not being hit at all but still being killed or an aim for the torso and a hit in the foot...LOL  One of the features in this game seems (in my opinion) incomplete. It's possible to create your own badge/emblem but there is no option to share it with others, so you can make/create a badge but you can't share the same badge with your clan members.  The graphics are ok but not amazing. Crysis 3 has way better graphics and lower memory and pagefile usage than this game. The memory usage during the game is around 9 to 10 Gb and the pagefile usage is around 12 Gb so for this game it's important to have enough RAM and graphics memory.  As for the Coop mode there are way too many cut scenes. A number of them can be skipped but the ones that cannot be skipped are annoyingly long. If you can live with that then there's no problem for you.",

The MP adds a class system where you get special class ability depending on a timer that shortens itself with better performance that is similar to Titanfall's titan acquisition mechanic. Double-jumps and wall-run doesn't feel as twitch-y as Advance Warfare's boosting, which is a good thing because AW players abused the hell out of it. Pick 10 system is polished and you can load it up all on guns or on your gameplay abilities. Also compared to AW, the killstreaks are much more attainable. No death in this game feels cheap or unfair, which is a huge plus in my book. I play this game with a 360 controller, and my K/D is about 1.2. People playing with keyboard and mouse will destroy you in face-to-face situations, but a lot of CoD is about spatial awareness, map awareness, approach/flank tactics, being hidden, and locating others, so the game is still very approachable with controller.  If you like casual shooting mulitplayer games, this is one of the best experience that is not Titanfall that available right now.",

Yeah they did a good job with dedicated servers and hit detection but its overshadowed by an over complicated ♥♥♥♥♥♥ multiplayer system with the same flaws that the GOOD call of duty titles had. Sometimes it seems like they asked little children what kind of shnit they like and just put it into the game like JET PACKS BEST IDEA EVER. No. This infuriating multiplayer sucks ♥♥♥ and I wish that MW2 had more people playing it because every time I get into a game on this I want to kill myself imediately after. worst game of the series and space wars cod infinite warfare is going to do the same old ♥♥♥♥. its like the world war 2 ♥♥♥♥ is happening again but in ♥♥♥♥♥♥ space which is getting pretty fluckin gey.",

Campaigns haven't been the same since MW2.  Zombies: I'm not a huge fan of Treyarch zombies, but the nostalgia of 'The Giant' is amazing. In addition, from what I've heard, they say zombies is a lot more complex this time around.  Mulitplayer: Well, it's good, but not as good as Advanced Warfare. While the game does benefit from interesting movement mechanics and specialist abilities, the pacing, balance, and team balance is way off compared to last year's COD. You'll have your soundwhoring perks and two hit melee attacks because people demanded it without any logical stance behind it.  Overall, Black Ops III is a good game, but far from being perfect. Others may like it more than I do, but who knows.",

Unlike csgo, it's different every time, from wall bangs to trick shots, there are so much more you do in this game than other games I've played on other accounts.  × There aren't that many mic spammers. In csgo there are a lot of toxic players and mic(or djs) spammers, but in cod there isn't that many mic spammers and if there are it's really easy to mute on the game.  × Skins. Like csgo you can get rare skins from crates or missions, some that have really cool and detailed designs.  Negative : × Cannot trade. To my knowledge you cannot trade, so what you unbox from a crate is just for show or for self pleasure to get something that's rare.  × Some major sound glitches and alt tab glitches. (might be just me) When I alt tab to (for an example) answer a Skype call, it takes a little long for me to get out/in the game, and when it does it shows that it is windowed some sorts and have to completely restart.  × ranks/skill groups minimized.

However, after purchasing and playing the game i take back the negative comments about it id made to friends. the game is FANTASTIC. i have experience fps drops ONCE and thats only at the start of modes i hadnt played before (1st time starting up zombies, multiplayer, and the story). in multiplayer im at a consistent 100fps (i dont like capping becasue i love seeing the large numbers lol) and in zombies its at a consistent 75 fps. i have setting pretty high and have had zero issues so far with any sort of bugs or glitches minus the time it took to get back to the lobby after my 1st multiplayer game was a bit long. but it seems to have fixed itself afterwards. if there are any questions. my pc specs are as follows: cpu: AMD FX 8350- 8 core 4.0 ghz (5.0 is overclocked) GPU: EVGA Geforce GTX 960 RAM: 8GB DDR3 ram Motherboard: MSI 970 gaming motherboard.  as i stated, ive had little to no issues with performance in anything. If you have a decent pc (mine isnt all that great tbh) and are a COD fan, i would HIGHLY recommend this game.  9.5/10 Really proud to see this game prove my doubt wrong.",

            "review_text": "I have some seriously mixed feelings about this game, and I'll try to capture everything I can in this review, but for now, I have to say that you should buy at your own risk.  First off, I've always been a huge fan of all the Treyarch titles, seeing as they seemed to be the only Call of Duty titles with actual changes between each game, but I have to say that I am completely disappointed with this particular title... The multiplayer feels as if it hasn't changed since the second game, and the damn voices that you hear saying 'Team Deathmatch' and 'UAV online' haven't even changed, I'm pretty sure. On top of that, the poor PC optimization has made this game more than just a process to set up and play. Though I can't really base my opinion on the game for that and only that, seeing as most games always have small slip-ups just after release.  Secondly, the campaign is so glitchy, and broken in framerate and performance, that it is just unplayable after a few minutes. Campaign was always the first thing I played whenever I got the newer games, and I always loved the Treyarch stories... But this one is just so unengaging, and barely interesting... I lost interest due to the lack of a real 'hook' introduction. It's not my GPU or CPU, seeing as I've been able to run GTA5, and a few more games on ULTRA with 60 FPS and no problems at all! I just built the damn computer.  Now the Zombie mode... I LOVE zombies. And the remake of Der Riese is fantastic to play around on with friends, seeing as IT'S NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND A SERVER ONLINE FOR IT. Not only that, but the fact that it's exclusive content kind of pisses me off, seeing as I think everybody should have that map with their game... It's not even all that changed, really. WHAT THE HELL IS THIS NEW ZOMBIES MAP THING! HONESTLY I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE F*** IS GOING ON WHEN I TRY AND PLAY IT!!! I'm so damn behind in the whole 'What to do' in zombies, seeing as I stopped listening to those damn easter egg things because they used to be an optional thing. NOW, it's almost like a 'You need to do the same f***ing easter egg every time you play the game to progress slightly and get the same outcome.' Which is a nice little thing on the side, but it takes away from the whole classic zombies feel... I feel as if all my countless hours and hours of playing zombies when I was younger, just don't count at all towards this game. That may be a good thing to some, but to me, it makes me feel as if I've been excluded from the very game mode I bought this game for... I hope there are some better maps and fix patches in the future.   Until the game is properly optimized, and most/all problems are addressed, I'm leaving this as a 'Do not buy, unless you're patient for future patches'",

I, like many players, have had no performance issues whatsoever, although I run the game on medium settings at 1920x1080 at 80Hz, capped to 90fps max. The FPS has never dropped below 80, with an i5 4670k and an R9 270X that seems very good.  As for the game itself:   For the first time in years I was actually pretty hyped for this. Having put lots of hours on black ops 2 (XBOX 360 lel) I had high expectations of this game. And boy it has delivered so far. Black ops 3 does feel fantastic. The multiplayer is awesome, improving massively on gunplay and movement- no more do I use just 2 or 3 outstanding weapons, I constantly find myself using lots of different guns, a first for me in CoD. The specialists offer something new and is a good idea- I like having the choice of 9 specialists and their abilities.  I haven't played much of the campaign so I don't know what that is like, but after playing the first mission it seems alright.  As for zombies:   I love it. I mainly play zombies more than multiplayer and this time treyarch have done extremely well after the calamity that was tranzit. The default map, shadows of evil, is huge, expansive and challenging. I'm still now figuring new things out about the map. Also, the XP system adds something new as well as the gum ball power ups- as well as the DLC maps, zombies could be classed as an entirely different game, it's that good so far.  Overall, this CoD is the best in years, and after a few performance related patches and fixes, the game should run well enough for most. Do I recommend it? Absolutely.",

The guns feel overall pretty balanced to me. I'm sure a few tweaks here and there but nothing super rage inducing.    Maps really impressed me in this COD.

The match making is as usually, pretty okay.. Not that good (I hate the way it keeps on getting me into almost finished games), but some good things like the way it doesn't get me into the same game if I rejoin.  The AI you play towards in online (also called bots), is to me, really bad.. How can they melee me with the gun when I am out of their sight (like.. Being almost behind them), and how can they be, in Regular difficulty just sometimes super fast non-scope snipe me?  The campaign itself is Averge, first when you get into it, it's horrible.. The missions feel the same and pointless, making you just want to skip through it.. Although, when you get the story, it's pretty fun.

Milk as much money from gamer as you can get away with. Feed them some lies and some of them will become blind loyalists that will defend your greedy actions to the death.  THIS IS SOLID PROOF THAT CALL OF DUTY BLACK OPS 3 HAS OFFICIALLY KILLED THE FRANCHISE ENTIRELY.  It's only been out for only 3 months and the game is already being sold for only $15! What a surprise!  This game is filled with hackers,cheaters,clan cowards,horrible netcode,lag compensation,an anti-pro player system that punishes you for getting too many kills and still no dedicated servers. What a surprise...  I am not joking here. It is now officially a fact that Activision has designed their game to punish pro players that have a high KDR and perfect accuracy early on their combat record. If you also receive too many kills early in the game the 'netcode' system triggers to secretly bog down your internet speed without showing it in the scoreboard and refuses to register your shots on time allowing the enemy to instantly fire back even though you had clearly fired first.  This is based on a 40-60 ping average and I keep a close watch on the scoreboard every 30 seconds even after my death only to notice that the ping rates are all equally the same and are clearly showing false ping rates without ever showing what country or region they are from. There were even Russian,German,French and even Chinese players on public servers for some apparent reason.  Because even if the enemy targets are staying perfectly still they somehow refuse to register your shots and blatantly punish you for it. This has already been proven time and time again that Activision/Treyarch are catering to the worst players in the game and completely erradicating the competitive scene and alienating the professional gamers that are simply too good at the game.  The real value of this game is truly in fact only worth $15 meanwhile older COD titles are still being sold for $60+ seriously? This is probably the last COD title that will make it's final run and 2016 will officially declare the COD franchise officially dead. I had absolutely no intention of paying $60+ for a blatant copy-pasted game.  I had made a video on my youtube channel to warn everyone to boycott this game or to buy it for the lowest price possible and it seems that even Activision are accepting the fact that this game has bombed and is already dead in less than 3 months. They broke even but I am afraid that indie game developers like I are soon going to replace this joke of a game and it is only a matter of time.",

For instance, when a multiplayer match starts, I have to wait until it stops lagging up. This nearly always happens after about thirty seconds, or after I'm killed for standing around. I can reliably know when enemies are around because the game starts lagging and the frame rate crashes. Then I hear the sound effects of getting shot, then I'm watching a replay of my own death. That, at least, is handy, since I didn't see it the first time. After the latest patch, the game crashes after a few seconds into the multiplayer. I also have to reboot my machine after each session, otherwise it'll run like garbage. I can't play, log out, then come back and play or the system will bog down and be unplayable.   It is really disappointing. I preordered the game, and I think it'l lbe the last one I ever preorder. I was never on the 'no preorder' train. This game changed that. I won't preorder because I'm tired of getting unfinished games. The 'we'll fix it later' model is absurd, and you wouldn't accept it in any other industry.   I hope they fix this game, as it is so much fun when it's not being buggy garbage.",

That's very performance killer. - Order Independent Transparency : Lowering from High to Medium looks almost the same, and provides a good performance boost. - Volumetric Lightning : Same as OIT, it just lowers the resolution of the effect to a sufficient one. - Ambient Oclussion : Same as Shadow Map Quality, putting it on High or Extra enhances the range of the objects that are rendered with the oclussion. Medium Quality still looks good for near objects and characters, and gives a little boost of performance.

The first 100 hours i had on this game were literally on the first zombie map. You can get the game and the season pass for like £55 - £60. So i suppose it depends if you're willing to spend that much money, purely on 6 zombie maps, one of which is a remake.",

Multiplayer Pros: + Gameplay mechanics feel diffrent than the previous cod games with new learning curves (thrust jumps, wall running). + Weapon balancing is great and there is a great variety in weapon choice in lobbies + The specialist system adds a lot more variety to the game making the multiplayer alot more fun + Paintshop and emblem creators allow for the people who have the skill, to be able to show off their designs and the paint shop lets you make your own camos that you can have in game + All the maps utilize the new mechanics with wall running and thrust jumping opportunities everywhere + Lots of challenges in the game that make you want to continue to play the multiplayer ( prestiging, camos , calling cards) + The free run mode allows for begginers to learn about the new game mechanics  + Lots of the bugs have been hammered out since launch and the game runs perfectly on my pc (you can literally tweet pcdev on twitter with your issues and they will get it fixed asap) + Lots of in game content avaivable in the black market like gestures, camos, calling cards, custom reticles, decals, and weapons (yes, I know right now the supply drops system sucks due to cod points but other than the weapons in supply drops thing, all the gestues and camos make you want to grind the game so you can get it) + Good support for the game post launch like dlc map packs and the release of mod tools soon  Cons: - Due to the small PC player base it is hard to find matches for game modes like demolition or free for all. - Some of the maps have really poor map design with lanes that blatantly tell you this is a wall running spot instead of it being integrated with the map - SUPPLY DROPS   Zombies Pros: + Very interesting setting for a zombies game feeling completly seprate from the multiplayer and the campaign. + Much more complex mechanics (pack a punch rituals, sword upgrade quests and the easter egg in general) + Interesting addition to the zombies storyline + Weapon customizing adds more re play value as one game you could only level up a pistol while another game you can level up your  + Gobble gums allow for more complex gameplay (it just isnt buy all the perks and you are set, you can also buy gobblegums) + Good voice acting from all the characters (The game has Jeff Goldblum in it, need I say more)  Cons: - No cons here.   Final Verdict: This game is definitly worth buying and you should even get the season pass while you are at it, the sheer content available in the game is definitly worth the money and mod tools are releasing soon so this game will definitly still be played for years to come. Don't judge the game by its title, this game is a blast and I enjoyed every minute of it.  9/10",

            "review_text": "This game's ban system is stupid. I was playing last night by myself on zombies talking to my friends on team speak like I usualy do because some of them do not use skype, I use a program called OverWolf that has been known for reasons of banning in several games because it uses an overlay and to anti-cheat systems can be detected as a hack. I was permanently banned from Call of Duty: Black Ops III servers for elledgedly hacking. Now unless my cheat engine (That is only used for single player restricted games I.e Just Cause 3 or American Truck SImulator) still had a process running I shouldn't not have been banned. However after my country wide test known as the ACT I tried to get on and play. Soon did I come to find that my game was offline and that when I tried to get online it said I was VAC banned and additionaly not even a vac banned, it said I was banned by the developers then which steam enforced as it is the develepors decision not steams. I have done nothing wrong to the game or anyone in the game and I have been permanently banned, I bought the deluxe edition as well as cod points to open cases, spending close to $150, Yes I know you are going to call me stupid for spending all that money but I felt like it ok? Back on track, Treyarch did not implement a ban appeal program meaning that even if you got banned permanently like I have for no reason, you are unable to reverse the ban and be able to play once more. On top of that if you even attempt to post anything about a ban appeal of this sort they will lock your forum post and practically tell you to ♥♥♥♥ off and go buy the game again if you want to play it so bad. They are pretty much taking your money and then banning you for some stupid reason and then they tell you that you can't reverse the ban even if it shouldn't have happened in the first place. Like what the ♥♥♥♥ TREYARCH, and yes I will use foul language here, and I should be able to in your games aswell. because it is rated M, no ♥♥♥♥ing 12 year old should be playing that ♥♥♥♥.

            "review_text": "TL:DR:   This game is not worth it. I regret my purchase and each hour I wasted on this game. If you want a true wall running, fun, arena shooter with fresh ideas and balanced gameplay. Please check out Titanfall. It is leagues better than any shooter Ive played the past couple years and is 10 bucks, all dlc now free.   Performance / General:   With a i7-4900hq (3.2hgz) and a gtx 870m (3gb at 1100mhz) I run this game at 50% render of 1028, graphics all low settings. Meanwhile Im running Overwatch at 1080, high, 90+fps. Running Fallout 4 high, 1080 (AO and advanceds off) at 55+. I can run Cod Advanced Warfare at 1080 Extra / High, 90fps. The point Im making here is that this game is terribly optimized. Also there are very strange matchmaking protocols. You cannot group or play with people in multiplayer if one has campaign installed and one doesnt. According to Activision support, this was by design.   Single Player:  First glance seemed a simple story that was slightly convoluted but still entertaining. A world with techonogy and humanity intermingling. Upon second glance i realized Id never know what was actually going on. Basically the story is like Inception. A story within a story, you have to go deeper. Also, the online coop was cool but pretty laggy. But then again, this is COD. Most people only play the campaign once. It was a fun ride, but AW had a better campaign.   Multiplayer:   Maps are asethetically cool, but literally every map suffers from stale 3 lane design. This isnt necesarily a bad thing, but it feels very unnatural since the maps are so small and tight quarters. Some maps just seem like reskins of others. The balance of perks and weapons was tolerable, except for shotguns. Shotguns with a laser sight outrange smgs. Balancing was honestly better at launch. The wall running was a cool idea, but in the interest of saving the game for the 'anti-future' crowd, theyve gimped it to a turtle pace. There are still unfinished features (highlights, emblem and playercard sharing, theater mode clip sharing, and audio sections all still say 'coming soon' as of July 2016, nearly a year after release.) Mod tools have also been in production since game release. More than likely waiting until after dlc 4 to encourage dlc purchases. Ultimately I am disgusted with the supply drop system. During beta 'legalspeak' was used to convince the playerbase supply drops would be cosmetic only. 6 months later there were akimbo shotgun pistols and a host of weapons more powerful than base guns, only obtainable by random chance gambling. Massively gameplay altering weapons locked behind random chance paywall, even to people like myself who paid $100 for digital deluxe preorders. Now there are hero abilities locked behind these as well. Obviously I feel this is a slap in the face, and I have nothing nice to say.   Zombies:  Ive admittedly havent played much zombies on this one. The maps were very involved and complicated, even just to find perks and pack a punch required some 30 minute ritual to be done. Classic wave defense zombies and fighting the horde for fun are no more. Easter eggs have become a requirement to function and the zombie community has turned elitist to those who dont pour hours researching these steps.    Score: 5/10 fanboys screaming the next cod will be better.... for the 4th year in a row.  ",

But I'm not going to buy season pass, unless there will be a good discount for it. If it will cost 30 bucks, I'll buy it. If it never costs that price, I never buy it. Simple as that.

Pros -Zombies mode is great, and is a definite improvement on the gameplay front -Multiplayer seems a bit reminiscent of Black Ops 2 which I felt was solid  Cons -I hate to be a broken record, but...performance issues. Since Ghosts these games continue to perform poorly on PC, they build them for consoles and then do a half hearted PC release it feels like. Sadly, Treyarch has fallen victim to this as well. Guess Activision hates PC gamers. -The mobility options from Advanced Warfare made it into this game. I find these mobility options frankly add nothing to the game except making it a jump fest like some old school FPS. I don't mind that in old school shooters but in a modern shooter like COD it doesn't fit well. -Black Ops 2 had decent character building, guess they felt the need to once again continue the gimmicky character set up once again that continued from Ghost. -They introduced a bunch of concepts in Ghost, and felt that despite Ghosts being of mixed quality it should be done over and over again! Nothing has improved from what Ghosts has done.  TL;DR: Sucks on PC in my opinion, COD: Ghosts just keeps getting reskinned and the decent qualities of the games pre ghosts seems lost. Skip it and keep playing BLOPS 2.",

The levels are bastrdized versions of previous COD maps now with more wall running and horrible spawn points. Oh your team pushed deep into enemy territory? We'll just spawn the whole team immediately behind you. No game ever gets fun kill streaks because everybody is constantly dying.

            "review_text": "This game has more content then you can ever imagine so the price is way fair at full. Zombies is obviously the reason you want this game though right? I am happy to tell you it's more beutiful than ever in this game and proposes a good challenge. Compared to other past COD zombies experiences, this one is much more challenging. You may take that as good or bad depending on your experience with older versions. Shadows of Evil, the base game zombies map, requires setup each playthrough before getting basic necessities like PaP open. This may also be taken as good or bad depending on whether you like the setup phase or not. I will say that the beginning setup can get tedious. However beyond that there is way more you can do that is quite fun like upgrading the swords. After a basic setup in zombies (which you kind of need), you can move onto the real fun. Personally, I would like to be able to skip the Pap rituals and other setup each playthrough but it's nothing I can't handle. Zombies come outside of windows 3x as fast in this game but it takes them an additional hit to kill you compared to older. The ranking system for zombies makes sense in this title and doesn't interfere with gameplay (hardly atleast). Shadows of Evil can entertain me for hours alone.... so what about The Giant? The Giant is unfortunatley a season pass holders map bringing back the simpler things in zombies for the casual player. Any fan of COD would probably get the season pass knwoing that each dlc is huge, however you may not have the additional money and it isn't at all necessary. That is your choice, and BO3 certainly makes it a tough one. The Giant is my personal favorite zombies map of the two for it's simplicity and golden camping spot! Shadows of Evil is still great and features more to do.  Enough zombies... what about multiplayer? Multiplayer is also fun in this game and has a lot for you to do when you first play. Gold camo is one of the best things to go for in this game that then leads to diamond and DARK MATTER! You can use these unlocked camos in zombies and the grind to get them is surprisingly really fun. There are a lot of problems with multiplayer that could hinder your expereince sadly. Nothing of bugs, however, some weapons are incredibly unbalanced and spawns seem to swap 24/7. This makes it hard to run a killstreak as people kill you before you realize it. After getting a feel for multiplayer, you can work around this and infact turn the game on your oponent. Everyone has a specialist ability in this game that charges throughout the match, each OP in their own way. Killstreaks are OP aswell, but are well deserved and hard to get. I didn't expect to enjoy multiplayer when I baught this game however really did despite it's problems. Weapon customization is better than ever in this game and you can even customize your character! Complete some challenges with each character that make you really get a feel for each, and you can even get golden armor! Multiplayer rewards hansomely for grinders and doesnt overpower one player over another!  Campaign? The campaign takes a while to get into but is multiplayer (up to 4 players!) and is long enough to satisfy. Oddly, voice acting within the campaign feels sluggish, whereas the rest of the game is enticing... The missions include action, bosses, and new components that seem to appear in one level only. For example, one mission allows stealth while another has you parkour across a city chasing a hoodie. Mostly, campaign insists of shooting and running to reach your goal. Missions change environments alot from human warfare at desert to surprise robot attacks underground a creepy facility. The campaign is 100% do able alone and features difficulty selection like you'd expect. For me, it was fun, but only after cool little things started to kick in and story started to pick up. You can level in campaign and unlock cool outfits aswell as find nifty decorations to customize your very own base! Campaign isnt the highlight of this game but is still pretty cool and has it's moments. I would buy a different game for a good campaign experience as it feels more like the bonus of this title...  So what about the games actual bonus modes? Theres Dead Ops Arcade, Nightmare, and Freerun. Dead Ops Arcade is a little addition to your zombies expereince that puts you eagles eye view to fight changing undead. Theres game changing powerups (much more than normal zombies), different zombie types (like skeletons), and minigames as you travel onward the maps. Multiplayer up to 4 players in Dead Ops Arcade and Nightmare mode. Nightmare mode is basicaly zombies in the campaign, with mystery boxes thrown in and changed storyline/dialogue. It's cool, but is much different than actual zombies and is not attractive. It is boring to be honest, you'd have to see this one for yourself. Freerun is cool but singleplayer. You are timed to reach the end of a challenging parkour course to try to best yourself and friends. There are different parkour courses, each getting harder as you go.  Overall this game gets a 7/10 from me :)",

            "review_text": "So, a new CoD game. This year it is Call of Duty Black Ops III. I'll be going over some categories in this review. And those categories will be the following: Campaign, Zombies and Multiplayer.   Campaign: I've been playing the campaign for a while now and I must say that it's a very ''Treyarch'' kind of campaign. Just how I like it! Full of customizable features such as Create-a-class in campaign, shared classes and the possibility of chosing which ability you wish to play with. Overall the missions are fun to play, especially with friends. The all new Realistic difficulty is actually really fun as well. So in my opinion this game is a great succes for Treyarch.  Multiplayer: Oh boy, we've arrived at the multiplayer. At this point I can finally say that i've achieved Prestige Master. So I think that i'm a position to review this section of the game. Anyways, multiplayer was and still is a great and fun experience for me.   Ups and Downs  Ups:  - Great dynamic maps in terms of making use of the new thrust jump ands wallrunning mechanics. - Neat weapon arsenal. Maybe a bit small but still okay, - Season pass content and modding tools are about to broaden content - Awesome and addictive challenges - Ofcourse emblem making had to be here XD. - Great support from Treyarch both in terms of patching and features like XP x 2 and Double Cryptokeys together with Liquid Diviniums.  Downs:  - Earning some weapons through supply drops. I'd like to state that it is fairly possible to get them through commons though. - Brecci and PO-6 sniper are insanely overpowered. And i'm not the type to quickly judge this, but these weapons are really OP. Not joking one bit. - Although I have Nuk3Town, it should be possible to everyone. I mean why not charge like €2,99 or something???  Zombies:   My favourite game mode in Call of Duty so far. But i'm sad to say this. Why? Well, I expected a bit more from zombies this year. But don't get me wrong, I don't dislike Black Ops III Zombies. I just thought that the previous games were a bit better in terms of replayability. For instance I really do like Shadows of Evil but I hate do all the rituals everytime to open the Pack a Punch. After a while it becomes kinda annoying. The Giant (Der Riese Remaster) on the other hand manages to amuse me a bit more. Also it's a pity we only get these few maps to play until DLC comes out. I wished they would have put more content in the game Zombie wise.  - UPDATE -  So I've observed this game for some time now and I'm ready to make some statements about the *New Stuff*  First off, I would like to mention the thing with the black market. So as we all know it is now possible to aquire weapons through supply drops.   UPS:  - New weapons hell yeah, more content basically.  - Adds more fun ways to kill your enemies.  DOWNS:  - Only a mere chance to get them in Rares not to mention the chance to get 'em in Normal drops. - Paid supply drops seem to be more efficiënt. (Even though it could still take hundreds of dollars)  Conclusion:  I think this game is definitely going the wrong way. I remember Treyarch clearly stating that they were against non-cosmetic stuff. This change however is solely Activisions choice as Treyarch had no partake in this decision.",

If you already have a hatred of this franchise, then yes, you won't like this game (For most of the Infinity Ward releases in particular, I'd hardly blame you!) Having said that, please give this game a fair chance. Zombies mode is pure awesome, and feels like the perfect continuation from BO2. The campaign, while full of cliché and very linear, is thouroughly enjoyable, especially because they added multi-player support to it. It almost made me fell like I was in a movie with the people I was playing with! The Multiplayer mode itself can also be good fun, as, unlike its predessesors, Treyarch have achieved good weapon balance and smooth mechanics with regards to movment and scorestreaks that, while not immersive as a 'realistic' FPS, still feels badass and refreshing. Graphics, while not Benchmark-grade, still look epic, and the appealing bright colors design motive is of great contrast to the dirt-filled, grimy enviroments that are typical to games like this. Mods are back, as is Steam Workshop support, which has been sadly lacking in this franchise and is allowing a whole new experience for COD on PC.  However, just like most games, it's not perfect. The RNG supply-drops, first intended to be cosmetic only (similar to CS:GO) are now an integral, expensive and annoying part of the game. Connections in Multiplayer are sometimes iffy (although, you might have Australia to thank for that), and aim-assist cheating is, unfortunatly, somewhat prevalent. Most of the time, though, BO3 is still a rewarding experience.",

This is not to say if you liked Titanfall that you will like Blops III. The new zombie mode I think is the most interesting and innovative.

Lag is a detriment, only Nuk3town is played and all they've done is add more weapons that are broken. Seriously, what happened to not using a double jump to win every gun battle imaginable? I get that the whole 'more angles to watch means more 'fun'' but, this is ridiculous. Instead of watching 3 angles, you have to watch 7 and that's impossible to do and have fun. Complimented by performance issues, it's just too much.  TL;DR: Game is not fun, unless you have friends. Just like any other recent CoD.

Treyarch finally listened and removed every trace of PlayStation icons on this version which was my last thing to complain about.  This game feels like CoD, movement has been increased even more than on AW, IMO this creates a learning curve even if you are expereienced in this series, killing player who are in the middle of the air is now trickier than ever.  Weapons are really good, for the most part because you can't have a game with this massive number of weapons and have everyone happy, you'll like some weapons and you won't tolerate others. In general I like all the guns in this game, unlike previous CoD's were I used to HATE certain weapons.  Graphics are good but unimpressive and even while this game is not unplayable, it feels like they could have optimized it more for it to take advantage of modern pc hardware. Shout out to the face models, they look fantastic and the cinematics are very well directed.  Level design is a bit lazy in the campaign (although this is exactly the opposite for MP) and in a very CoD fashion, the campaign is very linear and scripted so at the end of the day it is like this: run to b from a, stand behind these pillars and kill the targets, move on, breach this, kill those guys in slow-mo, go to the room, get the thingy and scape, etc. BUT!, some enemies are very well designed, some areas in the game are very difficult in veteran and just plain insane at realistic difficulty.   MP is very intense, in the level of previous games and sometimes more but killstreaks need to take some inspirtaion from early CoD games, here, some feel 'meh'.  Zombies is a great mode for playing it with friends and can get pretty intense and the old school feeling is very welcomed.  There are a couple extra game modes but they are not the main events so I'll limit myself to say they are ok but not something I return to very often.  Lastly, even if you don't like this franchise or the way the MP works in this FPS or even technical aspects of it like the graphics, you can't deny the enormous amount of stuff this game is filled with. There are TONS of game modes and TONS of unlockeables, this game has kept me playing for more than 300 hours which is almost the same as GTA V and it might even rival Skyrim some time in the summer and for that kind of value, this is a great game.  PD: People in MP play in the same modes over and over so if you want to exclusively buy this for let's say, gun game, this is NOT the game for you. Heck, DLC1 map playlists usually have about 1% of the total players for the game, sometimes 0%. Be warned.",

Computer handles it find and the FPS in the game is consistant.   I am not one for writing reviews and this is my first so that has to say something.   This game was quite fun at the beginning. It is just like any other Call of Duty game out there. You have the Shotgun guys running around blasting people, Snipers camping randomly no scoping, SMGs like crazy, and those very few people that run with a knife. I don't mind that at all everyone is good at their own thing. My gun I leveled max was the VMP and the VESPER fun guns, I tried all areas though too. How this game was put together and you get to choose your special is pretty cool and everyone is different in some way. Out of all the COD's this is for sure up there on my list.   There is always bad. I always played with my friend online. We would get into a good lobby of people that were around our skill level and when we did so it would randomly kick us out of the party and put us back on the start screen. Apparently they have not figured out how to team people up with their own skill level yet or their own player level. For example I personally am not a MLG pro and do not get 2.00 K/D or higher each match. I am roughly around 1.00 K/D so I should be matched with people around that K/D or if I am level 20 NO PRESTIEGE then I should be teamed up with people around the same level.   Keypoints of what I didn't like about the game.   - No Online Nuketown map? In TDM, KC, etc... - Hitting someone with the stock of your gun requires 2 hits 90% of the time - Hitmarkers on a target chest and higher sometimes can be 8 hitmarkers with the VESPER others can be 3 hitmarkers it is not consistant - The whole I'm around the corner and someone shoots me through the wall act is still there - Keybind interface was little confusing at first until I had to go into a match without bots to start pushing random buttons.  So at the end of this I would not recomend this game. Yeah it is cool you can walk on walls they got rid of the stupid jetpacks from last COD game and maps are pretty solid. You can only play so much COD.   Like I said I am no expert this is my opinion and I have played all the other Call of Duty's I have spent hours of play time before writing this review. Biggest upset is you can fight bots on Nuketown but I have never gotten Nuketown as a map in Kill Confirmed or TDM.",

I am a person who actually plays CoD for it's story well before multiplayer so let me start there. The story in my opinion is fantasic, it kept me interested and wanting more and more, even though I am not fully through it, I am sad only 1 mission remains. The 'realistic' difficulty really makes the other difficulties feel like a tutorial of how to play the game.   Reading other reviews about performance issues, Yes like most new games some 'out of the box' adjustments will be needed to be made. I will say I saw a most if not all of the ones I was getting resolved it by running in compatibility mode for windows 7. If I were to dock it anything it would be having to figure that one out on my own. However in hindsight, this is very minor and hardly the first game I had that I needed to change compatibility to rid mouse lag or game performance.  If you thinking of picking up black ops 3, but holding back because of the reviews. Let me offer my opinion on it. Pick up the game, try it out, if you have to run in compatibility mode or have to do any other tweeks, so be it. It is a great game, really good story and fast paced multiplayer. A lot of the PC community is willing to help out with anything, that is what makes us great.",

            "review_text": "If you have any friends that are willing to purchase this along with you then let me tell you this game is a must buy. With a friend this game is a blast, it feels so rewarding destroying the enemy team with your friend and then brag to your friend about how much better you did. We've played for over 70 hours and it's still interesting trying to find new strats and new ways to flank the enemy on every map. It's not exactly team based, but you could make it work (although 99% of the time me and my friend end up going our own way).   As expected the gameplay is fast and unforgiving, if you make the wrong move or switch weapon at an inopportune time expect to get killed. if the opposite happens and you opponent is the one caught making the wrong move, expect TO get the kill. scorestreaks are trash, you're best off getting something like an rc-hd or a dart because anything autonomous is going to get shot down with the broken blackhat in under 2 seconds every...single...time. If you play hardcore like me, just forget using the UAV. It's good in theory, but the enemy hearing 'UAV inbound' is like an invitation to the playboy mansion, i swear they get horny when they hear it. every teammate on that team with pull out that blackhat or switch to a class that has it and blow that uav up in record breaking time. They did release an update making it 'stronger' whatever that means, I'm sure one rocket is going to blow it up, you just can't cheese it by shooting it with a sniper 7 times.   Enough complaining, what does this game do well you ask? Well for one I actually like the addition of the cryptokeys and the black market. Yes I know, I know, microtransactions are bad mmkay (Don't act like you did not expect it though) but I think it's done very well. Unlike other games you can actually earn them, try earning a key in CS:GO. That's right, you can't, you're going to have to shell out 2.50. now the fact you can buy these crates seems rediculous to me, I can honestly say I don't think many people are going to do it. I think it was 2 bucks for a rare case, yeah right, it's not even like it takes that long to get them so I'm not complaining.   Now, the games guns are fairly well balanced, at least in hardcore mode i found. I don't play much of the normal modes, I used to but I have forgotten all I know of that in favour of the hardcore mode. What I found was a neat mix of some weapons that fire slow but could kill in 1 hit, and then some that fired very fast and killing in 2 hits. I find that to be pretty good and works well around people play styles. that's not to say it's perfect though, I've tested a lot of weapons and so far havent really found any completely unplayable. Never tested the pistols out, but that's most likely because their garbage, i would personally never waste a slot to use them.   On to the perks, they're alright. The only ones I find useful are basically the equivalent of quickdraw (i think it was fast hands or something, I don't remember) and gung ho. afterburner or whatever it's called where your jetpack refuels faster is useful as well, but what i find is I favour an extra attachment over this perk. That's the thing, being able to relinquish all perks for 5 attachments makes your weapon feel extremely powerful with yourself feeling weak. I'm more of a run and gun player so what I find is that I like to take off my sight (if the gun really doesn't need it, some really do as they have horrible iron sights) and put on the quickdraw like perk just because being able to aim fast after sprinting is extremely important. all the other perks like engineer, blind eye, etc. I find just completely useless with the exception of tracker if I can fit it into my build just because it can be very helpful. The reason being I find the others useless is because they have a prerequisite of having to have one of the useless killstreaks in the sky. blind eye makes you undetectable by I think all enemy aircraft. well guess what, they enemy aircraft is going to get show down in 10 seconds, I think I can wait.   Sorry for the rant, now on to the bad (as if killstreaks weren't enough, but I'll admit, some are good). The campaign, I bet you saw this one coming. The campaign is just what it's like in all call of duty games, run around and shoot what you're told to shoot. but I found the campaign even when playing with a friend was extremely boring. It took me and my buddy maybe 6 hours to complete and it is completely forgettable, i faintly remember something called a DNI interface we did to almost everyone in the ♥♥♥♥ing campaign. my friend and I would always make fun of the amount of buzzwords they try to use, like mainframe, DNI (I actually forgot what it stands for), hack, etc.. I think it's cool that they let you make custom classes for the campaign but I feel it would be too tedious to get those singleplayer campaign camos for the guns in multiplayer, i feel like nobody does that. I, like i bet many people including my friend, used the same weapon throughout the campaign just because you get unlockes for it. and it's unlikely you're going to get all the unlocks throughout the campaign so you're best off just using that gun. All in all, the campaign is a mess, it seems uninspired and all around just a bore to play through.   notice how I have not touched upon zombies mode yet? well, that's because in honesty I've played very little of it. it's cool and all, but it's just so complicated in this recent game that I have no idea what i'm supposed to do. Should I collect those golden things i found one time? should I open that teleporter thing that teleports you in some tran station, should I become the beast? what even is the beast? why am I vsing zombies? is it because I'm a criminal? is there an end game to this? I just find it frusterating. All i want to do is kick zombie ♥♥♥, turn on the power, and packapunch my damn weapon, it that so hard? Before you say anything yes I know I can get the old zombie map which I would love. Here's what i don't love, having to buy their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ overpriced season pass for their game. I hate the idea that i have to purchase something I don't even know whats going to come inside. Yeah, 4 map packs, but what if they're all bad? just not a fan, I would LOVE to try out the other zombie map but i can't. feels a bit cheap to give me one zombie map and if I don't like it, i won't even touch the gamemode you worked so long and hard on.   that brings me to something though, map design is great in multiplayer. I love the amount of options you have to flank your enemy. It makes camping a lot harder and I wish more people would just play kill confirmed, hardcore and regular tdm is FULL of USELESS campers hiding around EVERY corner waiting for you to walk by, so annoying. I forgot what cod had this mechanic, but I faintly remember that in one cod if someone stood still for an extended period of time I think they showed up on the minimap. Would love that in this game, would complete the experience no doubt. Campers are the reason I hate TDM, how can you even have fun playing like that??? oh well, people like different things I suppose.  On to performance, the game in my experience runs very well. I play on a desktop with a GTX 780, 8gb's of ram, and an i5-4670k and the game runs buttery smooth with no frame drops. The addition of a FOV slider is also very welcomed.  Finally, Treyarch, FIX THE MATCHMAKING AS SOON AS IS HUMANLY POSSIBLE! it's always a gamble whether or not i can join my friends lobby or he can join mine. I'm sure this has happened to someone else, it cannot just be me and my friend. I would say OVER 80% of the time I will get the message: ERROR, LOBBY NOT JOINABLE for no apparent reason. Our nat's are on moderate, party size set to the highest, restarting the game on both ends does not rectify it, so I'm only left to assume it's a server side issue.   in conclusion, if you're on the fence about it, just buy it.",

            "review_text": "Since I played the free weekend I guess I get to write a review for this. I play this game on PS4, and on there at least, it's a really good game. Framerate is consistent, story is surprisingly deep, multiplayer has deep customization, zombies has great puzzle and exploration mechanics, and there's a second campaign for free.  Some cons are that the multiplayer maps are filled with camping/headglitch spots, making the whole enhanced movement thing kinda mute, and the twist to the story is something you may never even know about because instead of putting it in the actual story, Treyarch bizzarely hides it in fast-scrolling text. Besides those issues though, I enjoy this game. It's one of, if not the most content-filled CoD game to date, and the multiplayer is some of the most balanced a CoD game has ever been (Besides those freaking flashbangs GRRRR I hate those).   All in all, this game has good stuff for everybody. Do you like a pretty good-sized story that loves to screw with your head? Well you've got two. Do you like a fun multiplayer romp that has great weapon variety, great modes (As well as safeguard, literally one of the best modes in the CoD franchise to date), and good replay value in the form of unlockable skins, calling cards and more? You've got multiplayer, with enough unlockable skins, achievements, camos, ADS reticle designs, optional challenges, modes, etc. to last you a very long time. Just wanna play zombies with friends? You can totally do that, along with the option of going much deeper down the rabbit hole and solving all the mysteries the new map presents.  8.5/10 +Great amount of content +Extra depth added to Campaign, Multiplayer and Zombies +No ASM1 nor Bal +Great story that loves screwing with you (Just look up the twist ending after beating it, it'll make so much more sense) +A second campaign made out of reshuffled levels from the first (Still a lot of fun, and surprisingly not sold as Day 1 DLC) -Too many camp spots in multiplayer ",

Graphics are nice, if you're into that stuff...  Cons: Pay 2 win?? Another reason why this whole series is a load of bullsh!t now Some weapons are ridiculous and underpowered.. For example, you'd think the bow would have decent range, but no, it goes straight a couple yards and plops. If I use a shotgun on a guy with a pistol, guess who wins? That's right, the guy with a pistol.. Trust me, from a guy that plays CSGO, it's not my aim. I personally hate the new zombies, the one from Black Ops 2 and the original Black Ops was so much better and simpler. Now there's the perks bullsh!t and one free map, for a $60 game I expect way ♥♥♥♥ing more.  Bottom line: Please, for your sake, don't waste your good, hard earned money on this. If you think $60+ is good enough to play a casual game, then go ahead, but in all seriousness, don't get it to play competitively. COD has never been about skill even when they implemented that league play or whatever it's called. Don't be an idiot on that part. It's not worth the money, unless you're filthy rich and have nothing to spend on. To be honest, there are better things to buy with less than $60. I have no idea why I bought this, lmao.",

Zombies is still ♥♥♥♥ing great as always (besides the fact you cant really run around them like you could in BO1 &amp; BO2 idk just feels different somehow)  Should you buy it?

I wish Treyarch would add a few more maps, but they have announced a DLC coming early next year, but I dont have a season pass so :( Nuk3town is sick, and is really colourful, and I generally prefer this game over previous Call of Duty's because everything has more colour, and because my eyes are not very proficient at spotting things, my K/D has gone up a bit, even though it is still like 0.75, and my W/L ratio is a terrible 0.7 but because I have not played PC fps in a long time, I think I am doing okay-ishy.  However, I live in Australia, and there are not that many players in the region and there are many gamemodes which have 0% of people playing. For example, I can never seem to join a Kill Confirmed lobby, which is one of my favourite gamemodes, so that is a dissapointing downfall for multiplayer.

IMO all the guns are fairly balanced and there is nothing that's completely intolerable, despite what people will say about black market weapons and how they're OP. I have gotten every single gun(literally) and they are not that much of an advantage. I haven't played much of zombies, but I can see the appeal, it's just too complicated for me. I have on the other hand played campaign and despite what people will say. I enjoyed it.

It was all right, but I wish there could be more gameplay elements than just shooting through hordes of enemies all god damn long. IS IT THE WORST ♥♥♥♥ING GAME EVER?!?!? No. Day One Garry's Incident is. Ew, ♥♥♥♥ that game don't play it. Now what I really enjoyed was the ZOMBIES. WOW. As soon as you get a couple of map mods from the helpful and very recent workshop then get a couple of your good buddies then you can have A HELL OF A GOOD TIME!!!!! :) So if you want a good Campaign, get MW2. If you want good multiplayer, ♥♥♥♥ that. Get BF1. But if you want good fun with your friends at zombies, there are better games out there but this is alright. This was my opinion. Score? 5/10",

Then there is the story, which revolves around you, a soldier that gets their arms ripped off on his/her first mission and replaced with robot ones. Then you have to hunt down a bunch of cyborgs while fighting a weird AI crow thingy, but apparently none of that matters because you were dead the entire time.  Multiplayer: The same old CoD multiplayer with a jetpack strapped to its ♥♥♥. Basically you fly around shooting people until your specialist's ablity charges up and then you INSERT SUPER-POWER HERE. Some of the maps also look like ♥♥♥♥ing play-doh.   I really hated this game.

I persoanlly play CoD for the campaign, and after being so happy with the WAW and MW2 ending, I wanted to jump right into the newest installment. however, it fails to deliver on an interesting story. everyone feels so disconnected. maybe its the third person cutscenes or the poor scripting but nothing evoked much of a response from me. 'Oh wow. he's the villian? NEVER wouldve seen THAT coming.' 'Oh lookie, he has a hero complex. who'da thunk.' only thing that took me by surprise was the reason you got your cybernetics.  all in all, wait a bit until your wallet takes a smaller hit.",

Kill cams show history being re-written when you in fact put 5 bullets into the back of an enemies head, only for them to turn around and 1 shot kill you, and shows you only got 1-2 bullets out, or sometimes nothing at all. Infuriating! Matchmaking is still a huge turn off for me, and many other have voiced their dislike of the feature. Most of the time it works ok. By ok, I mean you get into a game quickly, but there are many times when there are just 2-3 people waiting forever to get a match going. I have to keep leaving and try to get put in another lobby to play. No one likes waiting 5-10 minutes+ for a lobby to fill up, The game really needs a server browser, and custom match features that still make the game ranked. I may be in the minority, but I loved the 'Crouch only' or 'Tactical' servers of the original Black Ops. It slowed the game down, and made it more realistic.",

This is the game with the best graphics in the series. My theory is that Treyarch is tracking what graphics settings people use on certain computers. They are waiting until people buy it, and get settled and used to it. And studying the graphics settings on certain computers with certian hardware. Then they may use that data to optimize the game for you. They want to find what settings the community perfers. And optimize there users for that. For example 68% of people who use the Geforce GTX 760 have these settings but 30% have these, and then they find what is between, that is my theory on what they are doing. Also tell me is the game better than the last generation. Is Treyarch making progress. YES THEY ARE. So if they study other players, when they optimize it they will do it well. So believe in this game.  Cons - Not yet pre-optimized (see above for why i think this is happening right now), a few bugs. Pros - Every Other Aspect",

Sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside. Prepare the pans: Rub the bottoms and sides of the cake pans with a little butter, shortening, or baking spray. Make sure to get into the corners and all the way up the sides. Flour the sides and bottoms of the pan by scooping a bit of flour into the pan, then shaking and tapping to coat the bottom and sides of the pan with flour; dump out the excess. Alternatively, cut out a parchment round and use this to line the bottom. Beat the butter and sugar until fluffy and light. Cream together for about 3 to 5 minutes on medium spread (see above notes for more information). Add the eggs one at a time. Beat until the batter is very smooth and creamy-looking. Adding the eggs one at a time gives them a better chance at incorporating into a smooth batter. Be sure they are room temperature so the batter does not appear curdled. Beat in half the flour, salt, and baking powder. Add the sifted dry ingredients with the mixer running at low speed. Continue to mix until incorporated. Beat in the milk and vanilla. Alternate adding in the liquids with the dry ingredients so the milk has a chance to be absorbed without needing to overmix the batter. Stream in the milk with the mixer on low until combined. Beat in the remaining flour mixture until just combined and no more visible flour remains. Stir a few times with a spatula to make sure no more flour remains on the bottom of the bowl. Divide the batter between cake pans. Use a scale or mechanical ice cream scoop to evenly divide the batter. Smooth the tops with an offset spatula. Drop the pans against the counter to shake out air bubbles. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes: When done, the cake should be puffed like a pillow, golden, and pull away from the sides of the pan. When done, a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes should come out clean. Cool for 15 minutes in the pan. Run an offset spatula around the cake to make sure it's completely loosened from the sides of the pan. Flip the rounds out of the pan, remove the parchment lining, and flip right-side up to cool completely. Once cool, frost and assemble the cake with the buttercream.",

The new mobility is kinda neat, and is a nice twist on the traditional COD playstyle. The campaign looks entertaining and the story (from what i can tell so far) is pretty engaging. I havent encountered any major malfuctions or bugs yet... all except for one. There seems to be some kind of lighting issue with some of the maps and most of the campaign that creates bright, rapidly flashing lights appear out of nowhere. Occasionally these lights get so bad they render the game unplayable. Until Treyarch does what any respectable game company should do, and releases a bug fixing patch, I cannot fully recommend this game.

Well sucks to be you because if you face ANYONE that has a controller and you don't, you are ♥♥♥♥ed. The mouse has a delay to it, so aiming is like doing brain surgery. The guns are nothing like they used to be. Like the VMP for instance, Ludicrous fire right with the best accuracy out of any of the guns in the game. More accurate then the ACR from Modern Warfare. If you face that you are ♥♥♥♥ed. On to another point of Multiplayer: This 'future warfare' gimic is getting super old. They choose these gimics because they can pull ideas out of thier asses, and create things that go beyond all laws of physics. Now for Zombies: Whoever made the map 'Shadows of Evil' really has a tentacle obbsession. It's also hard as balls for new players, and all around not fun. They took the elements of Mob of the Dead and switched it with a tentacle wielding Cthulhu. The zombies, I've noticed, can smack you from great distances away and tend to run faster than the player at some points.   If I were to spend an hour or more on this review, great detail would arise. I don't have time for this. This game is terrible. Don't buy. Save your money.   0/10",

If you can't even play a game properly due to technical issues, it can be pretty frustrating. But the game itself is pretty fun. Zombie mode is fun, but weirdly complicated. Something that would be enjoyable to figure out with friends. The multiplayer is standard CoD fare. You should know by now if that's your cup of tea. Campaign is fairly enjoyable. I do recommend this game, but it kind of depends on what you are looking for in a game. If you really just want to shoot people in a game with well done fluid controls, this game is great.

The campaign and zombies modes are a disgrace, multiplayer is 100% run n gun/spray n pray... whatever you want to call it. Small maps, strong smgs, and the dumb booster jump/slide just cater that much more to that style of play. I would take any amount of a refund just to get rid of this eye sore of a game.

This leading to people having op weapons. They try to add in weapons from the other Black ops/Waw but they in the crate. Not only that but the main story is the worst iv'e seen in a CoD game ever. They DO NOT bring back any old guns (besides crates. But a very slim chance of getting it!) we all loved. This would have been a great touch seeing as its the last of the series. They give you one zombies map that has a bit of stuff to do but not for the fellas who just want to survive, rather than easter eggs.  TL:DR: Nothing is really brought back from the older Black ops. One zombies map. Bad Co-op story. Not worth the money. Cant buy dlc seperate. Must have season pass! Not worth the price.",

This is a joke.  -Guns are boring and all feel the same with unlocks  -Maps are small and horribly designed  -You get jet packs, yet you are still confined to corridors, even outdoors.  -Combat is a garbage. Up close is a spamfest, ranged you just get shot in the toe by a sniper rifle and die.  -Respawns are immediate on most game modes, guys spawn behind you constantly. There is NO skill in this game whatsoever. I can play it leaning all the way back in my chair smoking a cigarette with a cup of coffee and go 20-5.

            "review_text": "Call of Duty: Black Ops III has been a game that I've been waiting for over Three years. So let's talk about The Good, The Bad &amp;The Ugly.   The Good:  -The game runs smooth for me, and I never loss more then 150FPS. I currently have it cap'd at 150 since I have a 144Hz Monitor. The games FPS can go up to 0-1000 and un-cap'd I get around 180-200+ ( On Ultra )  - I love zombies, and I'm a huge zombies fanatic and have been playing it since release ( currently #1 ). Saying that I will tell you how zombies is. I love how you can put on attachments on you're weapons and even camos, etc AND use them in zombies. Not just in Multiplayer. What I mean by attachments is that you can have one optic and up to five actual attachments. Zombies is very very smooth for me and I'm enjoying it a lot.  - I love that you can customize you're settings fully as of in: FPS cap, FOV 65-120, Advanced, Hz, Res, mouse acceleration, etc. It is much better and more improved from Call of Duty: Black Ops II. They really made this game PC Friendly in the settings department.  - Love the leveling system in Zombies. I can now get to a prestige and enjoy ranking up even more! The max rank is currently 1-35 and let me tell you. Getting to 35 is not as easy as you think. Basically it's a lot better then just being Shoutguns in Black Ops II. Now if you see someone who is a high rank / prestige you are going to know that that person has been playing for a while and that he is experienced and can carry the team on his back!  -The weapons are awesome, and I love the sound of them when they shoot, as well as shooting when Pack-A-Punched.  Adding more weapons in DLCs like AW did would be a very good idea as well.  -The graphics and textures look amazing on the new engine! Now saying this I don't mean that they look better then Battlefield 4, but they are almost as good as Frostbite Engine. Now I have to give it to the designers, they did a great job! Every time I hit a nuke on Zombies the zombies burn up, and the fire and sound look so realistic just amazing!  -The game is very optimized with GPUs. You just need to turn down you're FPS / cap it. I had my FPS set to 170 and my card was using 80% and it was on 70C on 60% fan speed. When I turned it down to 150 it went down to 60% usage, 60C and I turned down fans to 50%.  -The game is and WILL get updated more and more as Dev's (PCDEV) are looking into it, and as well as listening too our feedback.  The Bad:  First of I would like to start of by saying that this game will be optimized in the future and become a much better game then it ready is.  - Now saying that the game is GPU optimized does not mean that it is the best at it. It could get optimized more down, but it maybe already optimized as much as it could be. Look at Battlefield 4. My card pushes harder on there but I get better graphics. Black Ops III has close to the same graphics and it pushes lower which is good. So since I am not a Dev nor know anything about this I could not say. The game has already been updated for CPU mainly for the i5's but having a i7 4790K Devals Canyon I saw that it has gone down quite some which is great.  - The game needs to implement some more Zombie / Multiplayer Leaderboard bans / Moderations. I have seen a lot of people already cheating there stats on the leaderboards of Zombies. Like round ' 999 ' I know that the ranks are server sided which means no one can go out and cheat / hack them which is awesome! But final saying is that there should be active leaderboard bans on players who cheated. Should not be too hard to just look, and report / ban by the Devs but that's just me saying.  - Takes a while for me to get into a public match in Zombies / Multiplayer.  - The WonderWaffle needs to be fixed and buffed as it is not powerful at ALL! What I mean by fix is that it would glitch out and NOT shoot electric at all and just shoot out a purpal looking ball that would just tickal the zombies ( not zombies(s) just one!  - Zombies need to be more optimized as it did not have a beta like Multiplayer did.  - Three-Screens needs to be more optimized.  - SLI needs to perform better as well as get more optimized. ( Two-Way SLI, Three-Way SLI, and Four-Way SLI )   The Ugly:  Most of the things that are in the Ugly Section are easy fixes that are VERY much needed!  - No Ping Setter / Slider like in Black Ops II when you could change you're ping and not get in a match with players from across the world like Europe, or from Asia, etc. I could not even find the option in the CFG like you could do in BOI, MW3. AW, Ghosts.  - The mic is currently not working when I press ' Z ' and yes I have changed it from B over to Z. I have also tried everything to get it working from changing it from Push-To-Talk, to setting the bar for voice from 0.50 to 1.00.  - When ever you back out of a game in Zombies you can NOT bring your party with you. Meaning that you would need to Re-Lobby just to get back together.  - I feel that the game has a ' Leak ' like a memory leak in it like GTAV has had. I feel like I am gittery once there and there. I have also heard FormlessTV say the same thing as well as a lot of other people.  - I also think that getting JUST 30Min of Double XP in Zombies in 24Hours is a little silly.. Think about it... after 30Min you are just about ready to set off and good to go and acually get to the training / killing part. Everything under that is you just at lower rounds / running around trying to get perks, parts, box, weapons, linking Pack-A-Punch ETC. I would like to see at LEAST 1Hour a each 24Hours.  - I that I think that the zombies swing there hand / hit you more then World at War did. If I get close to one I would get auto two swang, and then when backing of I would get swong from like 1.5-2 Feet. I know that they added one more hit to go down with OUT jug but I would nurf the zombies quit a bit. I feel when I play Shadow of Evil I get down way to  often due to the small caradors, and due to the zombies just swinging / hitting you.    This is currently the most I could get out of the game. Now I think that this game has A LOT of potential and it will get fixs and patches / optimized in the close near weeks. Remember Call of Duty: Black Ops II when the game was un-optimized. Yea it was pretty bad. But it got fixed right? sure did and now is amazing. So let's see Black Ops III get the same fix, but much better and faster!",

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

The campaign is easily the best in recent franchise history - it's meaty, well-written, interesting, and has reasonable replayability, while the multiplayer is standard series fare with a few additions to spice it up and compete with Advanced Warfare's supply drop system. Despite the (alleged) performance issue it remains the series' best offering on PC for some time, with strong graphics settings, an FOV slider that goes up past 90, and an actual ping counter. For people who are having performance issues despite running current drivers: wait it out, a fix will come. The game is worth it.",

In the beginning the game was alright, there was a couple preformance issues that were fixed. Then one day they added supply drops. It was still a great game, cosmetics only in supply drop that you HAVE to earn. But Treyarch added in cod points, which is where you can pay real money for cosmetic items. It was fine, no one HAD to buy cod points to do well, they only had to buy them if they wanted to look cool. But Treyarch saw that they were not making as much money as advanced warfare. So they decided to add some reskins of the combat knife. *The wrench*. But still, no one was buying them, so Treyarch decided to go back on their promise and add new weapons that were overpowered. Now multiplayer is broken. People will just rush someone with a new weapon so they can grab it, then when they have it they just camp so they can use it more because they know that they might not play with it another day. The campaign is not very fun, and I don't even know what 'Nightmares' is. The new zombies map is complicated, I am one of those zombie players that enjoys a laid back map like town from bo2. The upgraded bows are really hard to obtain and there are a lot of jerks that won't buy any doors. I know that Treyarch can't fix that but it's still annoying. I honestly might not buy the next call of duty knowing that another one will just come out a year later. I wish they didn't come out every year because you are basically paying 80 bucks *CAD* to play a game for a year. Unless Treyarch makes an AMAZING zombie map that isn't complicated and is fun, my review will stay the same.",

No matter how powerful your PC is. This is deliberate as it was on Far Cry 4 and Watchdogs on PC.   The weapon recoil is massive, why? It is an arcade game not a simulation. The boost jumping and power sliding has been done before and it didn't work then, it does not work now.    I wanted so much to like this game but I can't.   Pros...   Hit detection is good.  Graphics are nice, until the Frames drop kicks in.  Community is big due to success of Beta.  Modding tools is a good thing.  Cons....  Frames drop makes the game unplayable. Recoil is too big on AR. Flinch when shot is simply too much, and annoying. Power slide is silly. Boost jump is stupid and annoying.   7/10....Hopfully it will get patched soon.",

Now most of that is fixed ( actually treyarch fiyed most of taht pretty fast ) and the game is better then ever. it may has that futuristic crap going on but, weapons, score streaks and stuff are the basically the same as in good old black ops 2 only here and there rehashed and new made from scratch. so basically oyure playing a futuristic game here but when there would be a new movement system you would feel like every other shooter. so dont give me that '' i hate that futuristic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t'' crap. this is a game that didnt overdone ♥♥♥♥ like advanced warfare or upcoming infinite warfare...  anyhow. the gameplay and the newmovent system add up to be one of the best multiplayer experiences i have ever had. the kind of acrobatic fun oyu can have now and how faster and quicker you now are all speed up the game .  above that did i find myself to be liking the graphics and the music and actually most of the armory in this game. its solid and once again thanks to the new gameplay you now can play with different more uniqe playstyles then ever before.  pro:  +great gameplay  +faster PvP ... +... because of new movement system  + still good old call of duty feel. ( means its not even close a futuristic game )  + good music  + big ♥♥♥♥ing arsenal of gear + specialist. ( giving you even more unique playstiles ) + zombies top + campaign. pretty gut actually, great story and good characters with actual plot twists,   -but it is so imemrsive and explosive that you cant really reaplay it. you simply feel like you saw everything already and dont have the need to go back . ( i miss the old imple campaign where it was all about story and not dumb cinematics like in mw 2 .. good times )  - the sound is old. its decent for shure. but its definetly not a battlefield dice quality sound - the graphics. they are good but damn this engine is so ♥♥♥♥ing old and big and the graphics really could be better ... hope they switch engines someday... seriously. something will less then 60 gigs installed size maybe.. - with the slightest lag hitboxes get so big,. going into cover or being in cover downs chaneg a damn. you die anyway.  all in all. its a treyarch game. you get an epic fun and long time playable zombie mod. a decent campaign with even a world war two mission, and a great and epic multplayer that is one of the best the series ever had since black ops 2 . if you have no problem that treyarch used the future to implement perma sprint, sprint reload, wall runs and swimming , and kept it real besides that, then this is a ♥♥♥♥ing fun game to play.  8/10",

This cod changes up the movement style of AW with less rocket boosting and more wall running and parkour, it also adds a very simple class system in the form of specialists which give you one really strong ability, like seeing though walls for a couple seconds at a time to a flamthrower of doom, the multiplayer maps are cool for the most part with plently of high and low roads that use the new parkour and all the best gamemodes are back.  The campaign in cod has never been the focus but i like the changes done here, getting to pick a few faces and then later on change your armor, helments and the like is nice, after each mission you also return to a safehouse where you can create your own loadout, your cyber abilitys, review score and train. alltogether that alone makes this a bit different than most of the other cods where you just ran from place to place shooting everything with preset weapons.  Zombies, ah zombies, personally not my thing but i love the style here, going for a lovecraftian mix with a bit of 50s gangstas is very fun to see and the new non-zombie mobs keep things fresh, from giant bees to tentancle monsters.   The game has a few bugs because it is new and the I5 cards have a lot of problems but i am not going to write a REVIEW on a game that says 'my game is not at 60fps 0/10' because that would be very silly, personally i have got 60fps and nearly all time and my big issue was my sound was no working, a restart did fix this.  overall this game adds a lot of new stuff, some refreshing twists and is cod, the silly mlg game that you can plug in and play without a care in the world, might want to wait a while for the bugs and I5 problems to be fixed if you have an intel card or if you have not a lot of money a sale but this is a decent game.",

That sad i would recommend this game to any1 who likes playing CoD since is one of the best entries in this franchise.",

LOL Treyarch -- Im touched.  You have been banned from Call of Duty: Black Ops III Discussions by a Call of Duty: Black Ops III developer for your post in 'Call of Duty: Black Ops III General Discussions':   This is what i posted: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- IF YOU ARE HAVING PROBLEMS, Please change your review on the Store page in Steam! This game (Black Ops III) is unplayable Trayarch has continually broken this game in terms of wholeness. If we all change our reviews to reflect the continuous problems with multiplayer matchmaking, mainly Zombies, then perhaps we can HIT EM WHERE IT HURTS -- THEIR WALLET! Yes rise up, THUMBS DOWN do not allow them to make any more money off this con job of a game! Stop hireing actors to promote your games and hire competent programmers – dam you @#$%^$*!  Congrats just about 2% down since thread started – Thumbs Down!  Before reading errors, understand that i have Comcast Blast internet that consistently produces 90mbps down and 12mbps up speeds -- internet around Chicago rocks!!  TDM errors: Continuously: no error msg -- I get bumped out of the lobby back to menu or after a match ends, same thing very hard to play with the same people.  continuously: 'failed to host lobby' --meaning i get this every single time 30+ wtf, was working fine then this crap starts happening cant play at all!!! When i know there are 6k+ players online!  Continuously: 'Lost connection to host' -- load screen up then are booted back to menu, when some friends said they made it into the game but me and others booted back to menu. If you watch the pre match timer you can see it freeze.  Intermittent: 'connection interrupted' when i have consistent ping between 30-80ms,interrupted why wtf  Common: 'you have been disconnected from black ops servers' i get this every day! In a 3 hr gaming session it will happen once.  The statistics do not lie, thousands of people are having problems with certain elements of the game! There are many simple minded kiddies in this thread that say they have no problems with the game but when u check their in game stats you see that they only play one game type like TDM. Well TDM works just fine for me as well and im not saying the complete game is a total failure but that certain, specific game elements do not work. The proof being, this game has been patched several times now for game breaking issues, for instance the gobblegum glitch. Many people got this game to play zombies and me and my steam partys are all having issues and I’m not just talking about one set of gaming friend’s I’m talking about several.   Before the next troll responds with immature and disrespectable comments answer me this: Why they are constantly issuing patches? If the game is just so perfect and there is nothing wrong with it tell me why there are over 15 patch header notifications scrolling page after page? I just checked the patch history page and its never ending. All systems are different, as such, are susceptible to different problems. How much of a fool are you going to look like in a couple weeks when they issue the next patch to resolve the issues I speak of -- what will you say then?    Ban Reason:   Inflammatory unhelpful posting --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  3rd edit: Still thumbs down after May 5th patch They fixed the gobblegum glitch but now its even worse! Zombies SOE multiplayer party matchmaking is broken where players get server errors or get kicked for no reason. Therefore, you cannot play with your friends – total head ake! TDM lag is unbearable some of the time. The worst is random game crashes in windows 10 where no error message is logged in event viewer or Windbg its as if the games error handler just kills the program just like alt f4 – NO ERROR HANDLER!    2ND EDIT: WAS A THUMBS DOWN Constant BG_cache_getindexinternal - exceeded '250' items for type 'triggerstring' errors when playing zombie mode multiplayer! You have to play for about 30 min+, then if any one in Shadows of evil multiplayer uses a gumball there is an extremely high probability (practically every time), that you and/or someone else will get the following error; BG_Cache_GetIndexInternal - Exceeded '250' items for type 'triggerstring' in fact our team played 2 games where no one used gobblegum they were long games an hr+ made it to round 30. next match same thing long game i was all out of ammo 2 guys down had no choice but to use gobblegum for the chance to get an ammo drop and WOOPS -- Game crashed soon as I gobblegumed! i would have died any way but it just goes to show that it is true i have tested several different variations and same conclusion -- GOBBLEGUM GLITCH!!!   EDIT: THIS WAS A THUMBS UP  it does not crash anymore on windows 10 -- took long enough!  ORIGINAL WAS A THUMBS DOWN  Black Ops BOO BOO This game is a total disappointment as it crashes constantly! Multiplayer is broken and has been so from day one. I do not recommend this game until the developers fix it – it is not worth the head ake!

There are some considerations; Some GFX settings are very demanding even on the most powerful setups. Lowering volumetric lightning and ambient occlusion (or whatever these are called) will make great changes to the performance.  At this moment, I run the game at 60-80fps at 80% resolution scale with UHD resolution. In addition, I turned down volumetric lightning down a notch to reduce some massive framedrops for some scenes.  I use a 980TI, 8GB RAM and a non-K i5 4670.  The Zombies-mode is beautiful &amp; fun, but boy, it's expensive if you want both the Der Riese remake &amp; the 'standard' weird map. IMO, the Der Riese remake is more fun than the weird map.

Multiplayer: -Very fast paced compared to other CoDs - So far actually a fair amount of people in different game modes unlike others that ALL YOU FIND IS TEAM DEATHMATCH! - Good amount of customization -I had a problem with the paintshop and hear many others are also - ITS ♥♥♥♥ING BALANCED?! WHO DID THIS??? - Not sure how I feel about Nuketown coming back AGAIN...It was cool the first two but I kinda want something new. (opinionated) -The connection types seem to be off. I keep getting strict yet I have a 20-30 ping with a 5-14 upload rate  Zombies: -Glitching on matchmaking, will end up with 15 people for a 4 player game. - I noticed more customization on the zombies side, havent really gotten to mess with it. - You can actually level up and its not confusing like black ops 2's system. - The story line seems interesting so far -Had problems with connection on zombies compared to multiplayer (could just be the hosts)  I didn't get into the game much other than what I played from the beta and the few hours I got now but I really love this game. There are a few problems here and there but its not enough to say its a bad game. Maybe pick it up when you find it on sale I would say around $30 and wait to see if some of these things get patched knowing how game companies are today nothing comes out perfect first day but not saying its a good thing...Also I didnt really have a stutter issue like many people. I run a i-7k processor, radeon 7870 hd graphics, 8 GB RAM, on windows 10. I run everything pretty much on high, not max since I know my specs cant handle it and get a steady 60fps.   UPDATE: Someone in the discussions for this game brought it to my attention that the texture quality kills your system on this game so turning it down should help you if you are dropping frames.

            "review_text": "Positive.  + Wall running/thruster pack. This is very different to the EXO suit and reminds me more of TitanFall.  +Linked to the above, there is a very different movement system to previous titles. It is much better than COD Advanced Warfare in the sense that the gun fights tend to take place on the ground rather than in the air. You are not jumping miles and miles into the air to shoot people. It is more like the COD of old in this sense (however that is not to say that you can’t do some cool moves like flip off the wall and shoot the s**t out of someone on the way down!). The movement is still 3D, but the developers have taken into account the way our brain works. We don’t want to be looking up and down, which is a pain in the a**e, we look from right to left, the game plays in this style and allows for a smoother, more fun experience.  +You can practice your skills in the free running mode. If you want to be a boss player like me, then you can complete all four (I think) courses. These courses increase in difficulty as you progress. An example of this is when, on one of the later courses, you have to wall run on glass, if you don’t land on the glass right, it smashes and you fall, its game over dude.  +There is great character customisation; you can change a lot more things, head, chest, camo. You can now also be a female, allowing you to portray your feminine side. I tend to use this option on a Saturday night when I call myself Queen Barbara. But seriously, this is definitely a good move, and allows for more diversity in the game. Anything different in this manner, in my books, is great.  +It’s made by Treyarch, who, for me are the better COD developers in recent years.  +There is a ‘PowerTree’ play style on campaign that allows you to choose your skills, which in a sense is a skill in itself. You really have to focus on what you are choosing to get the best advantage on the field. In this sense the game is tactical and make you think of your own playing style and what works best for you. Personally I like to take out as many enemies as possible, while looking them in right in the eye. My favourite ability is the power punch where you can take out a load of the suckers close range - kind of like a human grenade, but no explosion! It reminds me of a WWE finisher. +The campaign is great. I enjoyed the Advanced Warfare campaign, but so far, and I have not completed it yet, I am enjoying this more. COD, for many years has been more about the multiplayer than the campaign, but the stories still matter to me, and I like a good, well scripted, thought-out motion picturesque game, with unique ideas – however I don’t just want to play an interactive movie.  +The graphics are great and are polished NEXT GEN style. The game is a beauty on the eye, it is colourful, vibrant and crisp. It is so easy to distinguish objects and people. With customisation, everything looks unique. For me, this makes the game feel more immersive.  +The kill streaks seem easier to earn. They are much like previous titles. They are none upgradable, and none swappable for perks – something that used to p*ss me off. It is refreshing to see this has reverted to how it used to be. +There are better spawn points. Not very often did I spawn in a bad place. I die a lot so this is definitely a good thing! +It is a lot harder to snipe. The sensitivity of the weapon changes as you scope. There is no autoaim and NO QUICKSCOPE!!!   +The game features mind control – NANO bees FTW. This, IMO, is the way warfare is going, even today there is mind control, however subtle it may be. This game is looking into the future and showing you what your kids, kids will be doing.  +Mods coming in 2016 - The main reason I bought this for PC and not PS4!  ZOMBIES IS BACK ,which is one of the main reasons I have bought this game.  +Zombies has its own progression style system. You can think tactics and customise your arsenal before the game has started.   +From what I have played, I can see that the game seems to encourage more cooperation than on previous titles, if you want to progress to those higher rounds, there will be no ‘every man for himself’ attitude.  +Zombies is set in the 1940s fictional Bork City, Jeff Goldblum is one of the main characters. He plays a magician and his dialogue is hilarious as he turns into a BEAST that literally rips zombies apart.  Negative.  -Maps are larger than Black Op2 (positive), but they feel a lot smaller due to the new ways of movement. It is quicker to traverse the map making the battle field seem pretty small.  -There are loads of perks that make things unfair – things such as sixth sense, which shows on the map when someone is approaching you from behind. You can see through walls with one ability, this takes away any element of surprise. One ability allows you to see an enemies footprints so you can follow him and kill him (this is somewhat more acceptable.) The worst one is ‘psychosis’ which is basically a way of the developers not being able to fix the lag problems, so they make lag an ability.  -Not many people will play the classic, hard core, barebones; original COD style gameplay, which is a bit of a shame, because there are so many things in this that is missing from the new titles, including this one. The game developers obviously need to change a game and make it feel more refreshing, however don’t try to fix things that are not broken – this has been the general evolution of the series though, not just this game.  - I’m crap and tend to get shot A LOT. Sometimes it doesn’t feel like a lack of skill though, but probably due to OP abilities and weapons – for example some of the weapons are aweful and take ages to kill anyone, whilst others are more realistic and take an acceptable amount of use to kill a foe.  -the movement, although better than Advanced Warfare, can still feel ‘clunky’. If you bump into a teammate whilst wall running, you will fall, and 9/10 you will die a painful death.  -no fully customisable controls, it would be great to have a ARMA 3 style control option so you can feel more comfortable whilst playing.  -no supply drops, I used to love the gamble of what I was going to get. It added variety to the game. I’m all about variety.  -It is very difficult to match make with friends due to server matching and lag. Something they should have sorted out from previous titles. Whilst on the subject of lag… in fact don’t get me started. I’ll mention two words: lag compensation.  Overall I would recommend buying this game. It is good, and you can see the developers are trying to make something different and new, whilst catering to a large global audience, all with varying tastes. My review is obviously my own opinion, and some of the points I have put across as positive may be negative for others, as well as vice versa. At the end of the day, playing the game was fun, and I think it was worth the money I paid. The longevity of the game, I am not sure of, isn’t Star Wars Battle Front out soon?",

Really enjoying this so far. All the customisation is just the icing on the cake, and it's so well done.  If you're looking for a game that is FUN and enjoyable, without a toxic community *ahem* CS:GO *cough* then THIS is a game for you. If you are more laid back and not a stuck up NERD about all the technical crap and just want to play games for fun, get this game. Most of people's opinions are based on other expeirences, which just recycles the same opinion all over. That's why this game has a low rating. It definately doesn't deserve it.  Just PC fanboys pretending they know about computers, by hating on a game they played for 2 minutes. Seems totally valid to me.   Anyway, if you're a normal person and looking for a fun casual shooter, consider this as your next purchase.  EDIT: After reaching prestige master, obtaining dark matter and hero gear, and playing older CoD titles again, the optimisation could have been done a sh*tload better. All that needed to be made was Black Ops 2, 2. The new engine has really held this game back a LOT. I've been playing MW2 and a little of BO2 again, and i'm enjoying those a hell of a lot more than I ever enjoyed on this.",

The campaign was really good in my opinion, but sadly did not continue much from black ops 2 just a few references. The multiplayer is what most people go for and it is great fast action gameplay. Sadly the supply drops are what is upseting with this game when i have had the game since day one and still have not pull a new weapon from them. The Zombies is probably the best part of the game it is amazing with the new pack a punch system and choose your own attachments and such.  If your new to zombies though it may be harder for you as if you buy the base game shadows of evil is harder for new people, I would buy the season pass with it since you get the Giant map it is better for beginning players. As for past players the overall zombies maps Shadows of evil and Der Eisendrache are challenging and fun.   I recommend this cod it is great and better than AW and Ghosts for sure.",

I have never really been a multiplayer fan in the treyarch games, but it is still good. Some guns are kind of OP, but really, in all games something is going to be OP. I dont play it that much, but its pretty good.  Campaign: Great. I had lots of fun completing this one and the story is pretty good. It gets pretty intense when MINOR SPOILER your arms get ripped off in the first mission",

Even for the PC all of these modes can be done in Split-screen co-op which is just fantastic that they added it this time.  I always prefered the Black Ops multiplayers and I wasnt too sure about this one at first with the inclusion of the jetpack and wall running but it works really well. There's loads of different weapons and perks which allow you to play how you want to play, not as much as battlefield as you do have to get into the fray with some of the maps being quite small. It may put some people off because the multiplayer is fairly fast paced, you cant really sneak around because chances are you will get shot from behind.   As far as performance, im getting about 110-130fps maxed out 1080p online with a 970 and overclocked 8320 so cant really complain in that respect.",

It reminds me of Advanced Warfare, but a more polished version that keeps you captivated and brings much more choices and offers. Its only been one day and people love to complain about hardware issues, PC gaming will always have its fair share of hardware problems because everyone has a different PC setup and therefore will run into some issues. It may be harder for the developers to initially address all the individual problems prior to this games release. Where as Xbox One has all the same internal parts and system software where its easier to target problems. Atleast the game developers are reading the complaint comments and working to fix the issues and ensure a better user experience. Overall my opinion is that the games great and offers an immersive campaign with great graphics and cinnematic scenes. The Online experience is fast paced as mentioned before and really offers the consumer a different approach to Call Of Duty that gives you that adrenaline rush. If you really wanna how the game works then I suggest watching Youtube videos of multiplayer gameplay and read the reviews of certified critics and not on Steam, I simply wanted to explain my own personal opinion and problems with some of this games reviews. REMEMBER; your own opinion is better than someone elses, everyone has different taste in gaming. Like the South Park episode of the Yelpers, this is a similar situation where some people think they are game critics and also like to complain about some small issues, but im here to voice an opinion which may be right or wrong.

But it isn't, there are a crazy amount of issues with this game like the stuttering or opening the game and the screen popups trying to connect to the online servers and never being able to connect and then crashing on you or being stuck there forever.  I really tried to play this game, I managed to get through the first two missions in the game with graphical settings to the lowest possible point and managed to get around 30 fps when nothing was going on. The moment i decided to move fps would jump from around 30 to low 20s or high 10s constantly. Every time new enemies spawned, the fps dropped to 9 fps at most and the game would become unresponsive. I managed to get to the third mission which has quite a bit of rain in it and my fps has now dropped to around a dozen frames a second in combat.  It says that I have 12 hours of gameplay,(I spent at least half of those 12 hours staring at the opening screen trying to fix the issues or testing it out) i wish i could have actually played that much. The first attempt at playing the MP was the game crashing at the lowest settings, after the patch that came out today I tried again and i managed to get 30 fps and i was excited for about half a second until a enemy player passed my vision. I chased after him only to discover the moment i began moving the fps dropped from 30 to 14 and then to 9.   I'm most likely going to ask for a refund because as BO3 is right now it is unplayable for me, I truly hope they manage to fix the game but I don't think i'll be buying this game ever again until that happens and I know for sure that I won't have problems like this.",

A friend and I played this from the moment it launched (midnight) until 9:00 in the morning just because the campaign is so addictive and multiplayer is so much fun.  For the record, I hated Advanced Warfare and Ghost, and I'm a Battlefield fanboy. But this is the best CoD in a few years. Good Job Treyarch.  Campaign: Pros - Coop, and it's addictive. - In-depth weapon and ability customization. - It's difficult. No more shooting paper people, enemy type and combination can be REALLY hard for you. - The story is actually good. It's not perfect, but it feels like Ex Machina, instead of MICHEEEEEEEAL BAAAAAAAAY all the way through. - Gore. Treyarch has gone so far to bring us a world that explosives and droids mean business. Limb business. - The chapters are full of surprises and wtf moments that only Treyarch and its Black Ops series can imagine.  Cons - Not long enough. - Lack of character development. - Bad voice acting.  Multiplayer Pros -  This multiplayer is actually fun.  It feels right, and it feels addictive. It actually reminds me of Black Ops I, and even Modern Warfare I &amp; II multiplayer. It just fefels right. -  No more flying around.  I know you can wall-run and jet-packing, but that's just traveling around the map in this game. It gives you big disadvantage that you just want to stay on the ground when shooting. -  Powerful specialist ability.  -  Gorgeous Graphics.  Man, I really didn't know that I would say this to a CoD game, but it's really colorful and pretty. -  Nuk3town is back again!  -  Modding tools, map editor, and custom servers coming soon! (2016)    Cons - Nuk3town is not available for everyone. - Escorting Robot mode is broken. For a CoD game, BO3 has a great multiplayer that meets my expectation. It's no battlefield, no CSGO, it's just CoD.  If you are looking to buy a fast-paced, fun to play, solid 3A title, this is it.",

Unfortunatly this is not the case and the game is simply unplayable. Seriously it is unplayable... My compter is 3 months old with an i7 chip and is far greater than the specs they suggest.  I think we are at a strange point in gaming. Tripple A titles seem to care less about pc gamers. Money is the fuel that feeds the fire and I guess we do not contribute enough to be of importance.  Side note: When ever I would change a 360 gamepad setting (yes I use a game pad because I am currently recovering from a surgery) the inverted button would uncheck itself.

There are not many combination you can think of using only 10 points, and you can find out that almost everyone is using the same things because there are some attachments that just don’t worth to be put in the 2 slot they give. The gear you take should shows ones’ unique. But there is no way you can do that here. The ability gap between characters is huge. For example, I choose the character that can found enemies over the wall, why the people I detective can know them have been detective? If they already know their location is been exposed, what is the reason to use the ability? This should be a sneaky ability that can kill enemies without been noticed. And I played hard just to get the ability to know their location, enemies already got the guns that kill me with only 1 shots, or using mini gun. The most terrible ability is the fire gun, this is sooooooooooooooo disgusting. They just run toward you, you can’t even fight back when you are on fire!!!!! The balance between guns is amazing. A shotgun that have the distance of submachine gun and the firing rate of a hand gun, even faster. The balance system of team also shows how many work Treyarch had put on this game.

Because of this paying extra for the digital mediocrity edition feels like a major let down and I now regret pre-ordering the game essentially rewarding you for a partially complete product.  Nov. 12 - Now that ive had time to actually play the game I can say I do enjoy what was given to us, the story is interesting however the missions can get a bit long so make sure you have the time to sit down and play otherwise you wont finish. Multiplayer is alright at best while the new abilities add something new and fresh its not quite enough to have me wanting more. The zombie mode is a slight improvement from the other games allowing the player to make custom skins for weapons in game as well as adding the leveling system instead of that weird rank system from Black Ops II. Overall the game is a great experience, a few bugs here and there but with the scope of the game that is to be expected nor do they ruin the game so they are easy to over look.",

            "review_text": "I'll get the bad out first:  Coming from someone who understands the process of building software, it is MIND-BOGGLING how many completely absurd bugs made it into the release version of this supposed 'AAA Action Title' for the PC platform.  Lets list just a few:  1) The game often starts in Windowed mode, despite it being in Fullscreen mode before it was last closed.  2) Whenever you alt-tab out of Fullscreen mode, the game automatically changes to Windowed mode. This one particularly sucks because you have to then go into the settings panel and change it back to Fullscreen before resuming play.  3) After every match, without a single exception at least for me, my monitor blue-screens for about 5 seconds before the post-match results / score screen pops up. Wtf?  4) This one might be too terrible to be considered a bug, instead I might describe it as 'one of the most idiotic design and implementation choices a team of software developers could possibly make'. This horrible thing I speak of is that the player's sensitivity is tied to the frames per second. . . What does this mean, you might ask? In short, it means that if your frame rate varies at all (Literally every PC game has a fluctuating frame rate due to the nature of PC games), your sensitivity will change synchronously with the frame rate itself. This one is especially bad for those who might have lower end machines, as they will likely experience a game breaking variation in sens that renders them unable to aim better than even the dirtiest of console peasant potatoes.  5) Piggy-backing off of #4, I find the optimization of this game to be questionable at best. When at full resolution, with all settings maxed out, I will admit, the game does look pretty nice. Animations in particular look great and the overall art design is a pleasure to take in. However, this game does not light a candle to the sheer brevity, scale, and technical graphical capabilities of Battlefield 4, a 2+ year old game mind you. The kicker is that my frames, on a map that makes the largest BO3 map look like the size of a ♥♥♥♥ing pantry, on BF4 is HIGHER than what I get on a typical BO3 map which is ♥♥♥♥ing CRAZY.  6) The last one has been slightly fixed but is still a glaring issue that ultimately will have to be completely remedied. The overall controls in general just don't feel great. Initially when the game released, it was not even possible to play at full resolution scale without massive input lag. Recently this seems to be slightly fixed, as I have been able to now set my resolution scale to 100% and still play without serious control issues, but again there is still some sluggishness to the controls that needs ironing out.  Congratulations, you did it, you made it through my huge rant about the technical problems of this game. There isn't much else to say to be honest. Ignoring all the aforementioned problems, the actual 'game' itself is ♥♥♥♥ing dope. Wall running, improved player / weapon customization, plethora of game modes, zombies, campaign, co-op, etc are all awesome and generally build upon the successful formula that CoD has employed over the last iterations to great success.  In its current state, I do not recommend the game, however I have strong faith that all the problems with the PC version will be fixed with due time. In the event that they are, I will update this review to reflect such a change in opinion. Peace.",

In multiplayer the oppsossing players tele transport and melt you, i actually dont look for players anymore, i just open fire in areas where i Iknow players will be. I do get an occassional kill. I am afraid to shoot at someone running away or unaware of me, that will result in an instant turnaround and me being melted with one shot. when i look at the kill cam, it shows me sitting there like a stump. i ve played cod for years, i always do well.( above 2 K/D) Not so with lagops3. There is something really strange with mouse input, and lag comp going on. Oh well, i can go back to dominating the older cods. wish someone would produce a good modern twitch shooter, not named cod. THat will not happen. The thing that is most insuling are the paid utbers hawking the game like they are independent observers. I wonder sometimes if IW takes into account the time you have spent on other cod's and then makes a calculation on your account to keep you from doing well, and to allow noobs to get good games.....i know that seems a bit crazy but , after a month of working on this game, i think sometimes they want veteran players to retire from call of duty and move on......makes economic sense. anyway thats my two cents.",

Multiplayer maps are small, the bunny rabbit players must LOVE this game with the jet pack jumping all over! LOL   Other thoughts: I would say wait for a lower price or wait until they learn how to pick a good host! I don't know why they can't just read the hardware and NO ONE WITH A LAPTOP EVER HOSTS!!! There are many of us with FIOS, 2 or more video cards, 32 or more gigs of ram, 6 or more CPU's. But it seems we always play on someones wireless laptop! At least I hope that's the problem because the LAG is horrible! Single player is OK a little boring with all the FORCED movies. If I wanted to watch a movie I would go to the MOVIES. Single player or local custom with bots play fine without any glitches. They really need dedicated servers or even let us RENT servers? I would chip in not to play on a crap host. If they ever created or released a LAG free COD that would triple the sales! It's a lot like Titan Fall but Titan Fall has better weapons, no lag about the same size maps and really is more fun to play. And Titan Fall is way cheaper! I still think Black Ops l is the best one they made.  I wish they had a star rating :) instead of YES or NO on stars it's a 3 out of 5.",

There is a progression system, where you can earn accolades but these dont give you anything apart from braggin rights. There were some references to the previous call of duty's, which I found pretty cool, but there are no characters related to the ones in previous games. On the other hand, there is co-op campaign now which is really fun with friends.  Multiplayer: Bunch of soldiers jumping around like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, camping with railgun snipers (Drakon), spamming shotguns and camping in corners. The new specialist system was actually pretty cool at the start, however now I just stick to one since there is not much point in playing as multiple ones, unless you're going for the hero outfits which require you to complete all challenges on all specialists. Furthermore, Treyarch added new weapons in the recent update, which you have to unlock by farming Cryptokeys and opening cases. However, these usually give you really bad looking camos, gestures, clan tags, and basically anything apart from what you want, unless you have hundreds of dollars to spend on cases.  Zombies: Very fun, but takes some getting used to since the zombies can get really fast. There is an awesome progression system, which is very rewarding. Also there's a new boss enemy, cool new wonder weapon, cool new replacement for monkeys which is an octopus in a jar, and awesome pack-a-punch weapons which look and sound amazing. However, to actually get to the pack-a-punch, you have to do 4 rituals in each area of the map which takes a lot of points and time, therefore getting set-up can take some time. Also, if you pre order the game or buy the season pass, you get a remake of Der Riese called 'The Giant'. The Giant keeps all the things that the fans loved in der riese, but it looks 10x better. One problem, with this map is that Treyarch has ruined the wunderwaffe. Now instead of its shots chaining to zombies instantly, the zombie that was hit is stunned for 1-2 seconds and then the lightning chains to others. Basically, you cannot use it if you're cornered anymore, which sucks.  Overall, I would not recommend buying black ops 3 unless it's on a sale, the multiplayer is the same as always but with new weapons being locked behind ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t black market cases. The campaign is worse than all the other call of duty's, unless you're playing co-op with friends. But, zombies is still very fun and has a ton of replay value, and there will be more amazing maps in the upcoming DLCs, so if you're a zombies fan then you should definitely buy the game + season pass.",

Multiplayer is very tough initially but as soon as you get used to the speed of play it’s a lot of fun. Somehow still have the same party connectivity issues as in black ops 2. There are a huge amount of frustrating issues in game menus as well as game crashes in sp and mp game modes. Lots of patience required at a lot of times. I believe (despite its expensive price) this to be one of the greatest FPS games ever, I just can’t help feeling that it wasn’t ready for launch yet.  Overall: It’s like paying 25% too much for a Golden Rolex that arrived in what I can only believe to be old cheap toilet paper. It has the ability to make coffee and order pizza but also have a tendency to forget it’s actually supposed to tell the time and often develops the audacity to insult you or your girlfriend for no apparent reason. Yes, it’s still a golden Rolex and at least your friends will probably fall victim to the pretty display and buy one as well. Just don’t let the other kids have too close a look or you might find you and your friends endlessly trying to prove and explain why it is still worth buying it.

            "review_text": "UPDATE----10 FEB  Ever since the last update, I have not been able to play this game anymore. I am getting the unable to connect to the server issue. I've tried all of the troubleshooting I can find and nothing has worked for it.      Overall: the game is a much better call of duty than what we have had in a while. That being said, it definitely has its flaws.  Coming from a 980 Ti, I still experience frame rate drops from a solid 60 FPS down to 24 FPS in certain areas of the multiplayer maps. I am forced to play at a mere 1080p with all settings set to their the maximum except the volumetric lighting, which is set to medium. I should be able to play this game at a 1440p resolution with maxed out graphical options while maintaining a solid frame rate, yet I do not. 24 FPS is game breaking for call of duty. A bug that I have noticed as well is anytime I tab switch back to my desktop, the game window switches from full-screen mode to windowed mode and I have to go back into the graphical settings and change the option back. Hopefully a driver update or a game patch will remedy this frame rate stutter very soon.  As of the launch date, the Haymaker-12 shotgun is overpowered due to the flinch mechanic that Black Ops 3 has. It is almost impossible to be able to shoot back with any sort of accuracy against someone who is using this gun against you, yet it takes three to four rounds from the shotgun to kill you, they might as well have made this shotgun a two shot kill. Either the flinch mechanic needs to be removed from the PC version of the game, or this shotgun needs a humongous nerf in its affective range.  As for the rest of the weapons, I simply haven’t unlocked many of them yet. It feels like once you have hit level ten or so, there is a larger gap between when you unlock the next weapon, I am not entirely happy with the ones I am stuck using. The lower level tiered weapons seem to fall shadow to those players who have played longer and have unlocked their higher leveled weapons. For anyone worried about quick-scoping, it is exactly how I remember Black Ops 2 having their sniper rifle mechanic.   The specials system, in my opinion are a way to allow younger children an edge for those who wish not to use this handicap. I would have preferred this weapons and abilities to not have been in the ranked multiplayer aspect of the game. Of course, removing them won’t happen, so I would like to see a lobby added that has most of the game modes such as team death match, search and destroy, kill confirmed, demolition, and domination, but disables the specialist weapons/abilities.  As for the Campaign, it’s like any other Call of Duty campaign. It’s neither rememberable, nor is it too terrible. I have yet to complete the campaign, and I am sure I eventually will, but it’s something to play when you need a break from the frustrating moments of the multiplayer aspect.  The zombies mode is interesting. Personally, Treyarch has turned its Zombies mode into quite the standalone. It has become way too complex for me to understand what I need to do without looking up walkthrough videos as to what I need to do to progress the story other than surviving the waves of zombie hordes. I miss the simplicity of the World at War original zombies map. However, it is still quite fun to play and escape from the forget campaign mode, and the frustrating multiplayer mode.  In closing, I can easily recommend purchasing the game. It is quite a nice refresh from the previous flops of Call of Duty games. But when are they going to take the hint and stop giving us these future mech-suit assisted games?! We are tired of this type of shooter. I am definitely ready to return the roots of the Call of Duty series and play a next-gen World War genre game. Before you buy the game on Steam and pay full price, check ♥♥♥ first, or wait for a steam sale or bundle. This game would definitely be worth your time if you pay less than forty-five dollars.  May your frame rates be mighty, and your draw distance far.  UPDATE -------------------  I just noticed that I cannot change my emblem or calling card. They always revert back to the default once I exit the menu. It's quite frustrating.",

Very few maps, no doubt players will have to buy more to get any replayability from this purchase. Running system stolen from Titanfall. An endless force feeding of micro transaction options. Which moron decided to make zombies an objective based game rather than out right survival? That person should look for another job. Oh and no one wants to have to sit through the storyline intro for zombies every damn time, skipping it halfway through actually makes it even more annoying, we should only have to suffer it once. Player models are fairly nice but drop the 'explosion in a paint shop' costumes. Graphically....not bad..... runs a little slow even on a decent machine but looks pleasant enough.

It's got the mechanics and gameplay, it just doesn't feel like you are a soldier anymore, you're a bloody walking death zone and for me that killed this game's reputation.  Unless the next Call of Duty is a remake of Modern Warfare (remastered and perfected) I don't see myself playing them anymore, otherwise it's not a bad game and can be entertaining, the multiplayer especially but it's not the CoD I remember.

Multiplayer- The Multiplayer is truly something different from past COD's with the new movement system that greatly improves on Advanced Warfares seemingly tacked on movement system. All the maps are specially designed for seemless use of the new movement system. Although there are some down falls like lag and the fact that 80% PERCENT OF ALL PLAYERS PLAY TDM!. Overall it is an innovative, fresh feeling Multiplayer experience with hours of fun (and raging) to be had.   Zombies- Treyarch has truly created the best zombies experiece to date with countless hours of zombie slaying fun to be had solo and with friends even if you do lose connection to a solo game of zombies.   The lackluster campaign holds the game back from greatness but is overall a worthwhile experience.   8/10",

The graphics are good for COD but compared to other games it is nothing special and the sound design is ok making the guns sound like guns. The guns also feel different but this is because they shoot at different speeds and nothing else. Now the gameplay. It unbalanced and terrible; i have been in a game where you must use 2-3 guns or you are at a sever disadvantage. This game is inconsistent with burst guns sometimes taking 2 bursts to kill and othdr times taking 5 bursts and you can not say that it is because health because I have played this game for 64 hours and when you stumble or spawns change so you are in the enemys spawn then one guy takes 1 burst to kill and the other takes 4-5. The netcode is terrible with trading being common place. I thought that because this was the most popular shooter at this point would have something oter than being a game with guns but it is AND THERE AREN'T EVEN MANY GUNS WITH 4-5 IN MOST GUNS TYPES. To compare Battlefield 4 has 12-14 guns in each section.......IN EACH SECTION. The peformance on PC is really bad; I can play GTA 5 on highest settings with 120 frames but this game will make me drop frames if I get into a fire fight where the enemy is within arms reach. I may be a salty child but it is because this game is unbalanced, a slap in the face to the FPS gaming industry and is lacking in content............. also the campaign is short and bad......... and so is zombies.

But, after drudging through the campaign with frame drops and stutters from hell, I find it to be a good story, but the PC optimization for this game is so bad that I've read that even people with 'Super Rigs' have trouble with the stuttering and freezing. I feel like they should have figured a fix for these issues, even after almost a year after release, which shows how much they care for their PC fanbase. Multiplayer and Zombies I don't have that many problems with, but it can still be jittery. I have a PC capable of Maxing out this and other games, but no matter the settings, it will still have its moments where it acts like it wants to crash. After manually changing a number in a file (which I should not have to, c'mon Treyarch), the multiplayer and zombies gamemodes run better than before. With the addition of the workshop, it is nice to see fan made creations playable, and that is really the only reason to get this game for PC. If you don't really care for that and only want the base game and its DLC, buy it on PS4 or XBONE, as I've seen smoother gameplay for those systems.  Also, I know you don't have to buy any of the Black Market crap, but hiding content behind a paywall, of a RANDOMIZED supply drop, is a pretty weak move for a (IMO) dying franchise. But you know, if you want to spend money for that cool looking weapon skin or exclusive weapon, go right ahead.   All in All: 5/10 - Needs better ports and less 'pay for cod points' crap and instead should offer challenges to unlock special stuff.",

Pros : -Campaign is great, the story is somewhat different from previous installments and it's co-op too. There is also customisation and a leveling up system which makes it more interesting to play. -Multiplayer has always been the highlight of COD and this one doesn't disappoint. There are now characters with special 'MOBA' like abilities which make matches more interesting. Map design is also much better in this game (basically, all maps follow a similar design pattern of mid lane, left lane and right lane like a MOBA). The weapons are mostly balanced which is good. -Zombies is amazing this time round, the Shadows of Evil map is possibly one of the best maps I've played in quite a while (I've played all zombie maps on all COD games). There is also new systems in place such as Gobblegums and weapon kits which makes zombies feel more addictive. -Mod support is now out, there are lots of great zombie and multiplayer maps that you can download and play right now. The kit has only been out for a month but I can't wait to see what they do. -Presentation wise, the game looks great with amazing facial animations and all that. The sound design is also pretty neat.   Cons : -PC Port issues : Performance is mostly good on this game but the game tends to have issues such as super high memory and video memory usage which could render the game unplayable depending on your system. -Business model : The game didn't launch with microtransactions but it has them now. And you can't buy the DLC separately which is a pain in the neck.  TL;DR Black Ops 3 is a fantastic Call Of Duty. It has lots of good content, great presentation, and mod support too. It's a shame that the game suffers from a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ publisher.  ",

            "review_text": "Graphics: Way more advanced than any other game I've ever played! Way better than all the other COD Games and best than the Counter-Strike Game.  Camos: Many different camos you can get, my favorites inclue Jungle Party, Dark Matter, Flectarn and Bliss. Although there is only 3 ways you can get new camos (Crypto Keys and 1 Shot Kill Medals and COD Points) its still a preety good system.'  Guns: Most of the guns are pretty good but some do need to be nerfed, such as P-06, Drakon and XR-2 but most of the guns are fine.  Gamemodes: There are many great game modes that people dont play, which I think is sad, such as Search &amp; Destroy and Dog Tags. The most played gamemodes are Demolition and TDM but I personly think TDM and Demolition are overplayed and people should try the other game modes.  Voice Chat: Underused, but it is a great system. Not much to say about the voice chat.  Campaign Mode: Really confusing but a plot line that would take me 5 years to right, it is mindblowing.  Multiplayer Mode: A great way to play with other people, that you dont know and you can make new friends and play new gamemodes with your friends. Parties are sometimes a bit broken as I get disconnected from my friends parties or my game would crash while trying to join one  Summery: Overall there are a few glitches and bugs but despite these glitches and bugs the game is the best game I have ever played. Well worth the $59.99USD its costs. If you are reading this and you haven't bought the game, sorry for some spoiler alerts, but you should buy the game. This game is highly recommended by myself  Enjoy playing COD/Black Ops 3 fans and Thanks for reading ",

Single player is pretty cool, the story is a bit confusing, and seems to be lacking a bit in terms of engrossing you into the game. Overall graphics are good, I'd say what is lacking the most is sound quality and effects. Finally, of course there is zombies, and I gotta say its still just as good, with some new touches, but gotta love the zombies. Overall I'd give the game a solid 8/10, and would recommend this game for purchase.",

I have been hesitating to write this review for various reasons, one of them that I was a huge COD fan, before this cancer came along.  Shall we start with the overall performance of the game.  - CANCER - Max frames per second on multiplayer = 60 - poorly optimized, directly freaking ported from console. - server lag - the game takes a lifetime to open  Next up, the campaign.  - cancer - there's no story, the only thing that made it a 'campaign' is that Christopher Meloni plays John Taylor, and god not even that could keep me interested, however I did complete the campaign. - Abilities make no sense in campaign, missions aren't missions.  Oh, and the multiplayer everyone waited for.  - even more cancer - pray for cod - GabeN remove this game but.. - the new characters are quite legit, two female characters in the base game, I really enjoyed the new characters, but the attributes don't make sense. You can be top frag, and your 'cyber ability' will last 10 seconds. Isn't that what scorestreaks are for? - speaking of scorestreaks, so easy to achieve. Any noob can just go scoring points like he's a pro, without working for it. - the blackmarket makes no sense to me, it's a waste of your money after you've spent R800( $52 ) without receiving Nuketown. - some of the maps, they're quite fun to play on, but now with this exo suit that was brought in from Advanced Warfare, you just fall off the freaking map the whole time, like okay. - the system requirements are such bull, Treyarch is brainfarting you all. - but, I did enjoy Black Ops II, favourite COD, next to Modern Warfare series, but rather go back to that before you buy this cancer, because Black Ops II got a 9/10 rating and Black Ops III 6/10... If that can't make you decide, burn your pc mate.  why I bought this game, I don't know... too late for a refund...",

Here's why: Campaign: I would say the downfall to this aspect is how the characters think that shooting robots is the only solution to anything, and that the missions can drag on for a very long time if you play it on hardened or higher. This drags my rating down, as the campaign is also very predictable. (It is extremely easy to guess when there will be an ambush, extremely cliché) Multiplayer: The multiplayer has considerably less screaming 12 year olds' in the lobbies, which is a massive plus and comes about due to the 18+ rating. It is also fun to play with friends, especially chaos moshpit. (except once nuketown has been voted in, it will continue to be nuketown). Multiplayer can get frustrating, but switching to the VMP or another SMG usually upps the k/d ratio. Zombies: This mode is great, especially with friends once again. I would personally recommend The Giant for a challenging game that reminds you of earlier titles, or Der Eisendrache for a more traditional game mode (no squid), but with a much easier map. Shadows of Evil is by far one of the hardest zombies maps, just because of all of the weird and challenging zombies that come running (or rolling) at you, and how confined it is. The pack-a-punch in SOE is also very hard to get if you don't understand what to do.  Overall, I would recommend buying this game, but be wary about the predictable campaign and its' long missions. 9/10",

Campaign is bad, really nothing new or revolutionary, but the fun part is Multiplayer. Addition of Black Market is also interesting and great for 'one more match' feeling.   If you can get a Starter Pack or when it is on sale, I recommend you to do so.   Review one month after launch:   It was a really bad on launch. FPS drops, crashing, etc. One month later and after two patches I have similar problems. My rig runs GTA V at 60 FPS all on Very High... what to tell. Other than these problems, game is really shallow.  Campaign is just a click simulator as you can pass some situations without shooting because everything is staged. Story 0/10. Multiplayer is ok for few hours, interesting mechanics (jumping, running on the wall...) but gets boring after 5 hours.  TL;DR Nothing revolutionary, don't get this.",

This game is good, im enjoying it alot, and i play alot of different shooters. its smooth, faste paced and have alot of challanges. theres also different classes whit different abilities that you can try out. The maps are also good, you get a hang of them pretty fast. If this was advanced warfare i wouldnt give it a good review, ill give this one 9/10  Sometimes the match ends because of the host's conection but thats no reason to give it a sucky review, for me it doesent happen often.  the game will run good if you have a good computer thats the way it is.  If you are new and want to buy it but afraid that its going to be to hard...dont think that way if you want it you buy it and practise, thats what i did. Hang in there!  So should you buy it? only if you like shooters like this one and like it fast whit alot of challanges.",

If you are a zombies fan like I am, this is a fantastic continuation in the series, and it seems as though Treyarch has put more effort into zombies than ever before. However if you are thinking of buying this game because of the classic, fast, and arcade-like multiplayer, I would not recommend this game on PC. The multiplayer playerbase is very small. Also, singleplayer is nothing new or exciting. In conclusion I love this game for what it does right, zombies, and don't even bother with what it doesn't do right, campaign and lack of multiplayer fun.

Some might be inclined to skip the single player, and some might not like the modern 'cinematic' FPS, but it's an example of that done well. - Zombies, if you like it, is more of the same. It's fun for a time - The multiplayer is solid. A lot of people have a past CoD title which it's all been downhill since (it'd be MW2 for me), but again, it does what it does very well.  Negatives  - Community online for PC isn't great - don't count on finding games easily for things other than team deathmatch. - Even fewer own the DLC, so it's probably not worth shelling out for the season pass unless you really want the zombies maps. - There are some character-specific challenges in multiplayer which have some balance issues (e.g. Nomad)  Overall, while it's somewhat formulaic, it's still a well made game at the end of the day. At this stage in the release cycle (written in late August), you're probably better off holding out for the next title if you're primarily interested in multiplayer. The single player campaign is a good shout for any FPS fan though.",

Is the rest of the game good? meh, I don're care about the multiplayer much and I thought the story was mediocre but the zombies modes are all fairly solid. Is it worth the 60 to play zombies? No. Did I pay basically for zambambalous? Absolutely. Did their sh**ty system of something but not much for everyone work on me? F*** yeah it did.   Overall, zombies has been slightly overhauled. It's been given some bells and whistles such as the ability to set up attachments out of game, the ability to assign your character with gumball (shortterm perks that are kind of trivial but can help) sets and such. Both of these things are avoidable so it isn't a huge dampening on my enjoyment of what zambies had been. It isn't quite Blops 2 memorable but it's still pretty solid. I purchased the game with the totally 100% absolutely exclusive [stay out, peasants] map of The Giant. It's a reskin of the wonderful map Der Riese's Pieces from World at War and it's just as you'd expect. Unfortunately, there isn't an mp40 this time around but you win some; you lose some. I haven't picked up the others yet but that's too much money for now. I Already Spent Too Much just for this.   If you have the money to drop and you're fond of the previous iterations of the zambinos modes, go for it. You'll be pleasantly entertained but if you're a sensible person and much like me in not really liking the series but just kind of enjoy zombies; maybe stray away from buying this. It's too expensive to warrant being stupid like I am.   Actual game: 6/10  Zombies mode compared to previous entries: 8/10",

            "review_text": "I'm certainly not a fan of the franchise, although I've played every installment except for Ghosts. I can confidently say that this is the worst Call of Duty multiplayer experience yet. There are a number of glaring, objective issues which make this a frustrating game to play, as well as even more which are more subjective and make this an unpleasant experience for me (and others like me specifically). The game obviously has some improvements however, and those will be listed last.  Objective Faults -the worst servers yet, which is a nightmare when combined with the worst hit-detection I've seen in awhile -multiplayer matchmaking is completely unbalanced with no option for new players to go against people their own level, which wouldn't be too bad except the game has a slightly steeper learning curve and the weapons and specialists acquired at later levels are much more powerful, new players don't stand a chance -the game has gone full pay-2-win -small maps and increased player mobility has made the spawning system even more broken than its been in previous games, enemies will constantly come up behind your team (favouring overly-cautious teams)  Subjective Faults -the visuals are incredibly bland an boring, every weapon looks very similar -the game is over-saturated with one-hit kill weapons, which, while often requiring some skill, makes engagements much shorter or prevents them altogether, you will frequently have no chance to fight back -all the maps are pretty much the same in terms of size and shape, in what is likely an attempt at making many playstyles viable in every map (the result is that the same class can be used on every map and every game feels exactly like the one before it) -rather than just dealing with drop-shotting, you now have to contend with many other annoying tactics which other players employ, including sliding, thrusting, wall-running, and again, drop-shotting. In the proportionately few instances where two players meet face to face, the result is often a Halo-like contest of jumping around in circles (this enhanced movement is made much more aggravating by the poor hit-detection and quality of he servers) -the developers have abandoned all attempts at disguising the fact that their target audience is twelve-year-old children, the game is crammed with stale internet humour and memes, performed by characters who are supposedly war-hardened soldiers. If you had any residual respect for the series, the goofy and jarring 'humour' and tacky metal music that has replaced an otherwise straightforward concept will rob you of it. -it has become impossible to visually tell your own team apart from the enemy team without relying on HUD indicators because the same characters can be on both teams, albeit instead of team-consistent uniforms they now have fluorescent, gaudy outfits that you'd expect to see in a parade -the weapons are incredibly gimmicky, and even more of them are so silly that they'll make you shake your head in disappointment. A certain amount of whimsy and 'rule-of-cool' rationale has been present in most of the later games in the franchise, but this one has gone of the deep end. many players stick to flying around the map wielding pipe-wrenches and baseball bats, serving as a constant reminder that nobody is taking anything seriously (which is likely what fueled the downward slope of these games in the first place, seeing as how easily people forgive their mediocrity)  Improvements -the customization options have increased greatly, allowing players greater freedom in decking out their gear -while certainly silly, many of the specialist weapons and abilities are actually really cool -its not a bad game to look at",

At first, you could only open supply drops with Crypto Keys, which you HAD to earn. Then they introduced CoD Points as a microtransaction, then started putting melee weapons in them. It doesn't sound too bad, but imagine all the kids seeing people with bats and deciding 'omg I want it', then targeting the people who have melee weapons. Even THAT threw off balance(Although it's not as bad on PC since all you'll play is TDM). Then they started putting actual GUNS in supply drops. Each new gun added to supply drops was more and more OP. So Multiplayer is a bust, campaign is a gimmicky mess that almost nobody likes, and Zombies is a joke because you have to pay for more maps. Not to mention, the only free map feels too crowded, and you won't get far without doing a bunch of easter eggs. Isn't the entire point of easter eggs supposed to be just for fun? Not game changing?

Is it worth $60 if you don't count the campaign? Not in its DLC-less state (not enough maps, maps are small-ish as usual). How do you solve this problem? By getting more maps. Well then, I'll simply download the maps off some custom maps site, right? Oh wait, that was the nineties. You have to shell out an additional $50 to beef the map pool and the saddest part of it all: this is the best deal as the Season Pass is a DISCOUNT price in contrast to the individual DLC packs. So that's $110 for this average gunk. And for those who are genuinely new to this PC/COD deal, it is important to know that these extra maps divide the player base. Take one guess where the majority of the players are. That's right... in the DLC-less player pool. So what does that mean? It means if you get the DLC maps you will suddenly have less people to play with, if at all. Right now, TDM is the only really popular mode, along with CTF and Domination way down the popularity pole.   Conclusion: Is this game worth $110 just so you can wait for lobbies to fill up? Nope. Forgo on DLC and 'only' pay $60 and run a very limited amount of maps? Doesn't sound like a plan. So what's left? There's a Multiplayer Starter Pack option that only gives you access to the multiplayer part (no campaign, no zombies) and this is the first time they actually gave us the option to pay as much as the (incomplete, DLC-less) product is worth: $15. So you can still enjoy the 'fun' that bad netcode has to offer, players shooting you down after you've passed corners even in replay, cookie cutter maps; the usual nonsense. At least I feel less dirty having paid $15 instead of $110 this time around. That, and the Specter specialist is keeping me entertained and making opponents curse me out on it. That's gotta count for something.  I recommend this game for the $15 price like I would recommend a MacDonalds happy meal to someone who wants to enjoy some greasy fast food.

As a port, I have had no issues so far, the game runs completely fine. Controls for mouse and keyboard work great, and when I plug in my Xbox controller it works just dandy as well. The campaign mode is... intriguing, although the ending is quite vague and confusing. The plot is extremely artistic, so while it may have you shouting, 'WTF IS GOING ON!?' time to time, it is still compelling and fun to experience. The multiplayer mode is fun, but still consists the same problems that every COD has had, mostly consisting of deaths you feel you didn't deserve, and obnoxiously overpowered shotguns. The new Specialist abilities are a great addition to the game and feel right at home in COD's frantic pacing. However, the best thing this game has to offer is the zombies mode. Even if you are just playing the vanilla game with the 'Shadows of Evil' map, it still offers tons of replayability. As a long time zombies fan, I was not let down and feel as though the developers of the game really stepped up to the bat, and knocked it out of the ballpark. The new cast is fun to play as, with voice acting from well known actors. In all, this game is good fun. The positives outweigh the confusing storyline and the ever-prevalent problems in multiplayer and I recommend it to long time COD and zombies fans, as well as those who are new to the series.",

NOTICE: it is NOT WORTH BUYING DLC if you are mainly going to play Multiplayer, DLC maps NEVER show up in Core playlists. They only show up in special temporary playlist that no one plays.  Black market weapons require some type of skill to use, so don't go crying about 'OP' black market weapons. In BO2, we only got 1 DLC weapon, in BO3 we are still getting more DLC weapons. Everyone is guaranteed 1 black market weapon thru contracts (win 75 games). My only complaint is the unnecesary amount of melee weapons, they all have the same mechanics but I enjoy using them, they almost always guarantee a kill in point-blank range.  Zombies is AMAZING! Tho the only drawback is that there are no game modes other than survival, I enjoyed the different zombies gamemodes back in BO2.  What I hate about Multiplayer the most is the absence of dedicated servers, always one player is the host. I can't believe they actualy LIED about adding dedicated servers. I also hate the team balancing, you are either on the team crushing the other or on the team being cruched on.

And almost everything else of the game is good, except for 2 things: 1) There are A LOT of headglitches. There are so many that the playstyle changed into: Rush to a headglitch, wait 20 seconds and get around 3 kills and then go to the next headglitch and wait again. This is just not me playstyle and boring and takes all fun out of the game. 2) The playstyle of other players. Despite the headglitches i keep rushing ( with isn\\'t smart, at all ) , but other players don\\'t. Some even stop walking after reaching a headglitch, this is just camping. Also players are using weapons that are perfect, with this new playstyle. This are mostly no-skill weapons with no recoil, which isn\\'t a problem if you use them, but i gets a problem when you use and you use this new playstyle  These 2 things just take the fun out of the game, despite of the game being pretty good.

But when i saw that i could buy black ops 3 starter pack for a very low price, i thought that i would give it a try and see if i would enjoy it better after years of the company having a chance to improve their games. I honestly don't know what the hell i was thinking at all. The game suffers from a lot of the same issues that has been plaguing it since the ps3 days, terrible spawns, guns at times feeling completely overpowered, maps suffering from too many open doorways, you would check your flank before turning around to push up and as soon as you believe the coast is clear, someone comes from right where you just checked and flank you anyway!  And especially on PC the game feels like a mess, i mean when it works, it works pretty well, running smooth, but when it isn't working, you will suffer from lag and what seems to be FPS drops, and i run a pretty decent machine, having a 750 ti, 8gb of ram, and an i3, this game mostly allows you to have the graphics set to medium and it still lags so i know it is mostly a connection issue with the servers, which you guessed it, is another isssue that has been with the series since the beginning. At this point i am certain that the companies behind these Cod games are in it for the money, because if they really listened to its community then most of these issues wouldn't be a factor anymore. The game is still fun in its own way, and it can be addicting, but this franchise will appeal to some people who don't mind the flaws at all. But if you are going to buy this game, at least know exactly what you are buying before putting money into this.",

It has exo-movement or whatever it's called which you can boost with and so on, but what is special with BO3 is that they nailed it. You can't abuse the boost but you can still use it. In my opinion it's perfectly balanced and the maps are perfectly laid out. The graphics are georgeus and the game is just really vibrant and saturated which actually makes me cry. Saturation and Vibrance can it self sell me a game, I just love the colour and LUT aswell. I haven't played that much of the campain but just like in the recent years of Call of duty it's pretty ♥♥♥♥. Another reason to buy the game is because of the mod tools that are going to be released later on which is going to make the lifespan of this game be increased alot. Well, in the end I really recommend this game, especially if it's on sale. If you wanna have alot of content in one game, then purchase this one!",

Let me tell you a story, CoD: Black Ops III was free for a weekend and I decided to give it a chance since the last CoD game I played was Ghosts, and that game was TERRIBLE. Anyway, I tried it out and, to be honest I enjoyed it! Even though it was only a weekend's worth of gameplay, it was still enough to make an opinion. I didn't get a chance to try the campain or zombies mode (though I've heard the CoD Zombies mode is great) because I only got the multiplayer starter pack to try, I think it's still enough to go off.   My conclusion is, if you're looking for a new game to play and have £12 to spend, I'd say think about this, but wait until the new CoD comes out before you buy to get this one cheaper.  My score?  6.5/10 It's a good game. Though painfully average it is still a nice experience if you're into shooters. To be honest, if you're only buying for multiplayer, I'd say get the starter pack instead of the full game. Even though there's no prestige, that doesn't really bother me, also, if you wanted the full version you could just upgrade to the full game for the price of the full game - the price you paid for the starter pack.  Thanks for reading! I hope this helps you in your decision in whether or not to buy this game.",

DLC maps are also good, I'd give them a 7/10. However, as always there are hardly any players on the new maps and finding a game on a DLC map is hard.

You can look at your weapons in 3D, there are flehed out specialist characters with their own lore. The supply drops are a waste of money and really annoying for people who don't buy them becuase there are guns your missing out on (luckily mods have you covered ;D). The maps are pretty ♥♥♥♥ besides Nuketown and combine, and the scorestreaks are a disgrace to the godly name they bare. 7/10  Zombies: Is very fun and much thought has been put into it. They first map is shadows of evil, and it is fantastic. While a bit complicated, the art is very nice and the gameplay is smooth. The rest of the maps are also pretty fun, bringing in new activities to do and guns to use. Mabye better than multiplayer? (oh ya and it has Giant remake).  Dead ops II: Its here for you to play as extra. Back on popular demand, its a nice some-what more arcady style of gameplay, but don't expect to get hours out of it. Its almost like a free DLC, but it came with the game from the start. Love Treyarch &lt;3 10/10  Nightmare: Fun take on campaign. Not the most entertaining, but adds a twist to your usually gameplay, and will feel somewhat fresh. You get to fight zombies. 5/10  Free Run: Awesome addition that I cant imagine the game without. Lets you play around with controls and new movement, while giving some speed-run parkour maps. Didnt spend alot of time in it, but they were fun hours. 10/10  Mods: The mods aren't anything to drool at yet, but it takes time. So far there have been many custom maps that I have played and enjoyed. Guns, maps, and changes to rules. New ways to play zombies and many more additions to come. 10/10  Campaign: Oh... well i didnt really play it. Its there, definelty nice that they put it in to finish black ops trilogy. If only it had something to do with the previous games. Its like a dream sequence or something, I really don't know. But hey, theres online version of it now! 2/10  DLC: Unless your a zombies nerd, they arent worth it. It adds a couple multiplayer maps, but on PC no one has them so you can't play online. The zombies map is the real deal, but you'll have to dish out 15$. AND THEY DIDNT ADD ANY NEW PARKOUR MAPS ;( 2/10  Few things to let you know:  This is the first Call of Duty I have ever bought The only other call of dutys i played: BO multiplayer &amp; zombies, BO2 multiplayer &amp; zombies, MW2 multiplayer, and MW3 multiplayer. I like town, but only becuase it was the only map in BO2 i played. Had good memories with it.   Conclusion:  Its a really good call of duty, that definitly strives for more content. Of course, quality over content, but this really is quality. I enjoyed myself, and ca't wait for the new mods to be continually released  ",

I was met with the usual glitchy menu and horrible matchmaking. When it finally found a game, I was put into an unbalanced sh*tstorm of nonsense. All the high-level players use the same cheap guns with the same spawn-camping style of play. There are plenty of times when you spawn only to die seconds later due to no fault of your own. Scorestreaks are not fun. Specialist weapons are cheap. The turnout is usually a steamroll win or a loss with no chance of ever catching up. The actual gameplay is horrendous. A few months ago matchmaking wasn't as bad, but today it's always terrible.  For months I've had endless issues with lag. Today it would be fine for a few seconds at around 50 ping, then jump up to 500 randomly and everything would lag out, causing the engine to wait to catch everything up. Death usually occured in this window of time. It didn't happen once or twice. It happened over and over throughout the entire match. It hasn't always been this bad, but it's unplayable right now.  DLC weapons are bs. They all require you to get extremely lucky or pay for the possiblity of maybe unlocking them. It's a greedy, anticonsumer system.

Cons: - Only one zombies map out of the gate (without the season pass) which doesn't hold my attention well at all. I mean treyarch, why not offer at least more than one like the past games. Zombies is your thing... - Some guns feel more overpowered than the other, meaning SMG's mainly are the weapon of choice over rifles. - Framerate drops out of nowhere mostly on zombies. - Miss when you were on the ground a good 75% of the time like in old call of duties and not sliding and flying everywhere. I know this is a given mechanic of the game that was shown even in the trailers but I thought it would be nerfed at least a bit more. - Ranking system is a little slow... - Some maps have completely useless underwater areas.

            "review_text": "Note that I'm not big on multi-player for fps games, so this review will pertain primarily to the story and technical aspects of Black Ops 3. Though I will get around to updating about the zombie horde mode. That said.  One belief I have is a game should be able to stand up on just it's single player alone. Black Ops 3 manages this, a bit wobbly in some spots, but stands solid for the most part. The story picks up some time after the events of Black Ops 2 and contains story content from the first two games that feel organic to the story, if the story made any real sense. The pieces all fit like a warped jigsaw puzzle, with funky exposition the player can feel lost for a majority of the story. Whether this is intentional or not, I leave to the subjective side of things. But otherwise the game continues the underlying narrative of how the mind is affected in warfare and the advantages and disadvantages of technologies role in both the public and private worlds. Though cliche, the story manages to not lose itself entirely to entire levels set in a surreal reality muddled with pseudo-science.  On the technical side, the game performed quite well. With only two real hiccups which consist of an entirely random ctd and one game breaking glitch which in which the AI seemed to forget just what it was doing. Frame drops only occured in a small handful of areas which quickly stopped after seconds. However the user interface feels very much designed for console without being reworked for a mouse and keyboard setup which ruins the pacing throughout the game. The in combat menu to select your special abilites is designed for analog stick controllers, wasting precious seconds in the heat of combat to choose an ability. As for combat itself, this honestly feels like a game that just happens to have the Call of Duty IP attached to it.  Overall, the single player campaign feels good. Not entirely worth a full price of $60, but good enough to catch on sale if multi-player isn't your bag and you want a good fairly solid shooter. I will say, the campaign feels like it should have a fair amount of replay value as Black Ops 3 also continues giving the player the ability to choose their loadouts before each mission, customize weapons and abilities as well.  Pros: -Solid single player -Great graphics -Performs pretty good -Campaign feels lengthy -Proper difficulty curve  Cons: -Bad user interface, needs to be modified for PC mouse and keyboard -Massive file size for vanilla game -AI can feel janky at times  PC specs for comparison: MSI MS-7850 Intel Core i5-4670k CPU @ 3.40GHz overclocked at 4.3GHz 12299MB RAM (12GB RAM) EVGA Nvidia GeForce GTX 960 4GB ftw edition resolution @ 1920x1080  Game was played at optimal preferences according to GeForce experience, in game settings of high",
