            "review_text": "While I enjoy the concepts a lot I don't think this game is meant for a pc release, or even a console one. I see now that there is a version for touch devices and I think that's where it belongs. I say this because a majority of the gameplay involves moving different colored blocks around a DDR/Guitar Hero-esque track. You only have a limited time to make matchs (before they hit the end) and it gets very hectic very quickly. Mouse controls just don't work very well for this, and I think a touch device would work better.  Anyway, the gameplay is cool and the ideas are unique enough that although they don't really work that well in practice, I recommend checking out Dungeon Hearts just to see this gameplay. I really want to get good at it but it's god damned hard, and I think the difficulty comes largely from the limited means by which we can play it.  Oh, the basic idea is to order colors together before they reach the end. You want to stop enemy attacks from getting off while building up your own combos via hitting multiples of s color. By hitting your colors you do damage to an enemy. Your team's skills aren't the best explained in game, so that's annoying, but yeah.",

            "review_text": "Where to begin. If I wanted to treat this game punitively, I'd say it takes the standard Final Fantasy team line-up (warrior, black mage, white mage, archer) and they've thrown in a puzzle game). I can't be that punitive. This game has complexity, and depth you'd struggle to find in some of puzzle games you'd immediately think of.  You have four lines across the screen, gems will slide towards you, if they reach the end, they disappear. If you move 3 of the same colour in any pattern except diagonally, you can make an attack gem. Which, when clicked, will attack the enemy you are fighting. The enemy has their own gems too, if you can't move them quick enough, or can't use your attacks to remove them from the bar, they will attack your characters and drain their health.  And I'm only getting starting. Characters level up between runs, learn abilities, monsters, mini-bosses, runes that make the game move faster, or randomly freeze different runes, or make you take more damage.  Oh, one thing I didn't mention. This game is tough. It starts deceptively simple, but it works through it's mechanics like Neil DeGrasse Tyson blows your mind.  It has different modes of play, an easy to grasp tutorial level, and a very FF-esque art style (think DS remake FF games).  The only thing I can even think to ping this game for, is the soundtrack is incredbily repetitive. You might do better to listen to your own tracks and turn the music off entirely.  The best part? This game costs under a dollar. Seriously, less than a small fries from McDonalds. If you've been looking for a rich, deep, and challenging puzzle game. I implore you, pick this up. You will have an absolute blast.",

            "review_text": "Ok so people might be giving this a bad review but this game isn't meant to be played for long periods of time, which so people who bought this game have which might show.  Since this game may have been ported over from a mobile device app it still is fun to play even for just 10-15mins. Even though the mouse draging in the game might be a bit annoying for some, I found it fun and some what quite interesting to play with as it keeps you going keeps you thinking too (well at least for me it did).  For the price you pay (even though i paid for it when it was £0.49) you shouldn't expect all singing all dancing game for such a small price. Sure the GFX of the game isn't in a 1920x1080 or higher res for the average user but still feeling like a game people shouldn't mark down so harshly (in my opinion).  If you want to test you mouse pointing skills or improve how fast you can do this (depends on what you want to do) then this game is ideal for the once a day play sort of idea. I might be talking rubish for some but thats what I see in this game. Nothing too much, just straight play of the mouse and see your reaction are to the movements of your mouse.   Great game and I spent 21mins on my first go and enjoyed it.  Recommended for people who just want to test their skills on moving objects at fast pace with just the mouse as for those who prefer to use WASD (if thats how you would prefer) then its not intended for that use.  10/10 I probs being playing this once a day to keep me going :DDDD",

            "review_text": "I had this game on the iPad for quite awhile so it was simple transitioning to the PC version knowing all the mechanics and psuedo-strategies. Which is probably why I got half of the achievements so quickly within the first hour of playing the game, hehe.  Now, where to begin... This game is no ordinary RPG, it's really a mix of somewhat-RPG mechanics and a constant score attack. Even during the leveling portions you're required to be matching tokens all the time, and the best advice is to stay on top of everything. Like any match-3 game, match 3 regular tokens of the same color to create an attack token that when tapped, will do an attack with that hero. The player can store these tokens by sliding them along the constant stream of tokens that fly past, and you can accumulate them to do huge combos. These attack tokens are more for just attacking however, as they also remove any gray tokens and regular tokens of their color in their current column and row thereby eliminating the chances of the enemy being able to attack the player's heroes. Enemy tokens can even be moved as well, allowing the player to set up combos while removing the enemy's method of attack.   While the levels start off easy and slow, the game picks up in pace and sets more roadblocks as the game progresses through status aliments and enemy tokens that require multiple hits to get rid of. Enemies also do increasing damage, and hits become nearly fatal in the last 5 levels. The enemy variety is based on random elements, and each has their own set of hexes and even altering the speed of how fast the tokens come at the player.  The graphics and music fit the game very well, and the soundtracks are amazing that I'm sometimes coming back to the game just to hear the music. Its streamlined well, and makes progression eminent throughout the levels.  My only qualm about this game is how the mouse/finger can be inaccurate in moving tokens due to how the Fatestream is continously moving, but then the game wouldn't be hard if it wasn't that way. Definitely a recommend.",

I especially like the level-up mechanic - after each battle, an additional short fatestream appears, and each match you make is a level up+partial heal for the corresponding hero of that color.   My only criticisms are that the mouse can be sometimes clumsy when you're trying frantically to move pieces around. Also, the games should earn more XP than they currently do - as it is now, it takes a little too long to buy hero upgrades.  Overall though, it's a surprisingly addictive game. The combo mechanics and different runes can be confusing at first, so i'd recommend  this guide  for new players to check out.",

            "review_text": "Considering that I enjoyed 10,000,000 to a fair degree, I had reasonably high expectations when I heard Dungeon Hearts was a mixture of puzzle and role playing games as well. Much to my disappointment, I instead found myself bored to death within 20 minutes of starting.   My biggest gripe with Dungeon Hearts overall is that the RPG elements feel very tacked-on and unnecessary. Character skills are poorly explained and feel clumsy to use due to generally poor interface design. Above all, there's very little feeling of actual progression and very little done to break the general monotony of the gameplay. Every enemy is fought in more or less the exact same manner - form attacks by combining 3 of the same color piece, move the attack gem onto a line that contains an enemy attack gem, and click. Repeat ad infinitum. Combined with the total lack of story, the 'epic journey' feels like little more than a slight occasional change in backdrop scenery.   When you strip away the façade of supposed RPG gameplay in Dungeon Hearts, what remains is the puzzle game aspects. Unfortunately, as stated before, the puzzle game core is incredibly repetitive and comes with a click-and-drag system that feels incredibly choppy and awkward to use. In the end, the only redeeming factor to be found is the surprisingly solid soundtrack.  In summary, Dungeon Hearts pretends to be a unique blend of the classic 'match-3' puzzle type game and an RPG, but at the end of the day, the RPG aspects are little more than a shallow veneer coating an even shallower game.",
