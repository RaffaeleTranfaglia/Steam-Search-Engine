I'm writing this review after playing the game for only 25 minutes because the two other reviews are like by people who just don't get the point of the game. The game is good, definitely worth playing.",

Yes Was it worth the money: Yes (bought during a sale)   I am already enjoying this game after the first hour. The first thing the game tells you is, that there are no hints and no tutorial, you will have to carefully watch, try stuff and explore for yourself. Just like the games back in the 80s and 90s! I love that! Modern games are made too easy. I already saw negative reviews that point out exactly that! Come on guys, explore a bit yourself, turn on your brain!  It's quite an interesting genre, it's not your typical strategy game where you can scroll through out the map and select all units. You only control one character, the captain, and you can tell your fellow pirate men what you want them to build for you. Make sure you are close to them when giving the order, sometimes they won’t hear you if you’re too far away.  That being said, it's definitely a niche game that will only attract a certain group of players. The graphics and interface are on purpose kept old school. Anyone who played games in the late 80s and 90s will understand nostalgic touch to this game.",

            "review_text": "As a Pirate Captain lead your shipmates in settling an island and growing in power. Gather resources, build, trade, and train soldiers.   Everything is done indirectly by issuing orders to followers who might just not listen to the order. Followers need to be paid with gold too, otherwise they refuse to do anything. Other gameplay elements include fighting off natives as well as a growing imperial force. The Captain can fight and is stronger than normal units, and can be further enhanced with equipment obtainable through dungeon runs.   All this sounds nice however it's also extremely frustrating. Particularly with regards to orders on being followed.  There is no central storage of resources, everything is just kept in piles on the ground. As such, keeping track of stock is done by the pirates counting items and 'remembering' stock levels. What this means is that pirates are not always aware of just what is available, items can be stolen or procured without updating the totals. This in particular I found very frustrating as multiple times I ran into a situation where I had piles of stone but my workers claimed there wasn't enough stone and would not continue building. Or worse, they think there are no coins left and stop doing anything even though there are coin piles around.  As the world is randomly generated it may happen that only small islands are created and a colony has to be set up across many islands. Even then building space is limited and follows a sytem similar to that of the old Settlers games whereby each point on the map can only suport a building of up to a certain size depending on several factors. This limits what can be build on each island even more. Travel between islands is done by ship and only the captain (and his guard) can set sail. To establish a colony on a new island the ship is sacrificed to provide workers and raw materials. Setting up production lines across multiple islands requires a lot of micro management and effort to ensure pirates actually do what they're supposed to (see paragraph above).  Other reviewers seem to heap praise on this game, it may very well be that it's not be a game for me. I did not enjoy the few hours that I played and cannot recommend the game. IMO games like  Gnomoria ,  Kingdom , or  Dwarf Fortress  [www.bay12games.com]  are much more entertaining.",

I realised the game wants you to learn it yourself with very little hand-holding, and I learned the mechanics over time. It's a surprisingly fun and challenging game as a result, though not for everyone - if you're a fan of rogue-likes and RTS (and if you're patient) then this game is great for you.",
