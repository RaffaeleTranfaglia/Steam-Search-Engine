            "review_text": "An interesting game with some amazing visuals. For once we get a fresh take on battling monsters, instead of taking place in the far flung fantasy filled past of wizards or knights, or in a galaxy far far away in some doom wannabe, we get a game that lets us take on mythological creatures of the past in the modern world. This game does have bugs, its not perfect, and the controls are kind of shot. Some strange bugs encountered was that the sun in the sky would appear through objects or when in an enclosed room or tunnel and one gamebreaking bug at the end of the game. The game played with a keyboard and mouse is way to easy. The controller controls arent great they skate around and the look or aim seems to often fly all over. While normally I would hate that, this isnt a platformer where any precise jumps are required. In a way the bad controls added to the challenge. Somehow the floaty controls for aiming made me feel like I was there since noone would stay perfect in that situation with their aim.   Multiplayer is dead since gamespy is dead, but the story is fun, many of the visuals of the blown up burned out city are great. Def worth a playthrough and if its too easy just exit and change the difficulty.   To pass the elevator glitch that kills you at the end of the game go to 'C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\Documents\\My Games\\Legendary\\PandoraGame\\Config' set framerate to 30, then play until the next checkpoint exit and set it back to 300.

The single-player campaign is quite short, but full of spectacular and varied scenes. It's a lot of fun, but too linear, and the use of generic weapons, imprecise controls and inconsistent graphics show a lack of fine-tuning.Legendary isn’t the most involved or technically excellent shooter out there, but it’s a fun change of pace with extremely satisfying combat.",

There wasn't much to do with games then as AI was limited and graphics were too but the devs definately made a playable combination of diffculty and entertainment. If you like mythology and big, violent creatures tearing people apart, this game is for you. If you get bored VERY EASILY with linear gameplay, this game is not for you. It was 2008 when this came out, remember, there weren't a whole bunch of open ended games then.  If I could fix two things, I would have asked for more weapons/animus abilites and better collision detection.  There are times where you're running in a straight line to escape an enemy and you suddenly stop - not because you meant to but because your character got stuck on a penny-sized bump on the sidewalk or a plant. Seriously.  Other than those two minor hiccups, the game was great for what it was and when it was made. Over all, 8/10. 2 points off for aforementioned problems/issues.",

            "review_text": "This game feels like it is only half finished. From the storyboards used as cutscenes, to the sticky controls (I use an xbox 360 wired controller and the analogue controls are extremely jerky) this game looks as though it could have been a real gem but constantly falls short.   There are times when your character literally get's stuck on a ramp or a step, because the programmers haven't made the blocks fit properly. The controls regularly let you down as well, such as the jump (which is the worst jump feature I have ever seen, it's practically a hop) which you can press and time to climb over something and yet you simply don't.   The story starts of well, but by the end it is clear that the writyers have no real idea what they are doing and it pretty much goes to hell quickly. The missions have you jumping around the globe in an instant and the storyboard cutscenes do a really poor job of showing you any sort of time passing.   The ending of the game just sort of happens as well. It doesn't really explain (at least very well) what your role is in stopping things, you just have to use your powers to overcharge a computer that is connected to Pandora's Box..... Which personally I find pretty funny considering this is based on a Greek myth and so I would have figured that there would have been a more magical and godly way to close the box, but apparently not.   Finally, the main reason I am leaving a negative review....  I could have lived with everything I have said up until this point and whilst I wouldn't have recommended the game, I wouldn't have complained either. However, right at the end of the game there is an elevator that is simply broken. You stand in the Elevator to go to the final platform, and your character falls straight through and into nothing, seeing the worldspace dissappear into black above you. I looked this up and it is a known issue that has been complained about since what I am assuming is release (2012). There are posts that claim there are ways to fix it, but none of these fixes worked for me. Frankly though, I shouldn't have to fix a game that has been out for at least 4 years anyway. This is a gamebreaking bug and the developer has quite literally ignored it and ignored the complaints that it has triggered. This is unacceptable and frankly it is disgusting. The only way I could complete the game was by using a noclipping (walk through walls) hack that someone on the forums suggested. This led me to wander through the world space until I found the next trigger point to be able to continue the mission. Again, this is pathetic and unacceptable.   Do not buy this game. Whether it is £10 or 1p, I would not recommend paying for a game that is riddled with bugs and where the developer clearly doesn't care. Save your money and buy something from a studio that cares about the product that they release.",

The sceneries and pacing however really make this game. In the beginning a great golem made from cars and wreckage roams through NYC, destroying everything in its path. Later Decard has to defeat a giant Kraken in London.  The campaign is quite short, only around 7 hours, but that is a good thing: The developers didn't reuse and repeat the sceneries over and over.

However, the shooter elements are pretty good, and while the game tries a bit too hard on the horror-like elements, it does a good job of making the various monsters pretty intimidating.  The actual story started out semi-decent, then evolved rapidly into something really stupid, then ended pretty well. It's not something to write home about but the ending was nice.  Overall it's not bad even if it is kinda short (5-6 hours). Worth a look if it's on sale and you want to waste a few hours having fun shooting mythological creatures. I advise avoiding the hard difficulty setting, and even turning it down to easy if the challenges get annoying. The difficulty is poorly tuned and it is a bit more fun on easy than it is on other difficulty settings.",

Just enough interactive elements to make it somewhat immersive.  A different take on combat than you sometimes see. For example, some beasties you might have to injure in a very specific way in combat or after they are felled to win.   It's different, and you'll have to think on what you know of mythology to really get it, which makes the plot that much more immersive. Some of the environment is destructable and has to be destroyed to logically solve a puzzle to get to the next stage.  CONS Somewhat on rails as you're essentially guided from one area to another by the environment.   The intrigue is taken away if you read the notes on the creatures and such as they're somewhat spoilerific.   Although much of the environment is interactive or destructable, enough of it isn't that it's easy to forget to try to puzzle through it as if it were a real-life or Dungeons and Dragons type game.",
