            "review_text": "  It's hard to put my words regarding this title because of the high artistic nature of this game. It can be said to a lot of point and click games. Karma is less of a game, and more of an expereince, a surreal, psychedelic experience, certainly a unique and unforgettable one IF you can apprecaite it. Yup, a big 'if' right there. Point and click is a niche genre, always has been, and even more so today. It's a genre of hit and miss, especially for a game that takes a more artistic path like Karma. So, the big question is, is it the point and click game that right up your alley?    Dark Innocence",

            "review_text": "I was able to play this at PAX West this past September and I’ll be honest, it was frustrating and confusing at the time I played it. Coming back to it however, they definitely refined a lot of small, but major gameplay elements such as hints, and providing more of a tutorial, which definitely made playing it today a lot more enjoyable.  The game is definitely one of the more unique games I have played, and for a point and click, I found it fairly well done. My only complaints would have to be there are no settings (the volume is rather loud at times), controls would get a little bit buggy (trouble with click response times), and you can’t skip past animations (which was more of an issue when achievement hunting). Aside from the few negative things I mentioned, I really loved how the story is presented, because it does leave room for interpretation and imagination. Additionally, the art style just makes the game visually appealing and interesting in its own way. Together the some-what vague story and art give you a sense of curiosity which for me made the game very intriguing.  Overall I really enjoyed the game and can’t wait for the story to continue.",
