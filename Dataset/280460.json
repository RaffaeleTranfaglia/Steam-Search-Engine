            "review_text": "This has been fairly fun to play to far. Each game is very short, lasting a matter of minutes. It looks like the longest game played in the online highscores is only 10 minutes. The controls aren't customizable so if you're playing with a mouse, be prepared to hold the left click down until your hand cramps, because that's the only way to fire, and you don't want to not be firing (why isn't this automatic?) The game's contrast also leaves something to be desired, as it gets difficult to see the bad guys coming at you. Also, since the screen is rectangular instead of square, enemies coming from the top and bottom of the screen are much more dangerous than the same enemy from the left or right.  With some improvements, this game could be more fun. Not bad for a couple dollars.",

            "review_text": "Albeit functional, Pulstar is a rather unremarkable twin-stick shooter.   While graphically fine, it is hard to distinguish between the multiple power-ups since every single object is a glowing orb. This aside, enemy bullets are a bright, contrasting red and are easily distinguishable. Also, the fact that there is only one ‘stage’ is disappointing.   All in all, I find myself struggling to come up with more to say, as the game is pretty barebones. Even for it's low price, it is hard to recommend considering the whole experience is very shallow.",
