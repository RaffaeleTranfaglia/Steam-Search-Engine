            "review_text": "Repetitive and dry Zeus vs Monsters is little more than a successive problem solver amplifying an issue we already see with kids and mathematics, it's dull and boring, small perks are a brief description of the mythological beasts that appear every 5 levels as a boss and the ability to select from either Zeus or Athena as your avatar. It has potential to be useful for people interested in drilling in the basic mathematical functions of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division while under time pressure; but I cannot recommend it as a mathematics game for children as it lacks little to encourage continuation.",
