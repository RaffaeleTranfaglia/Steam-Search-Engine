            "review_text": "TLDR at bottom.  -Do you enjoy intricate team based gameplay, where you need to trust in the skill of your allies?  -Do you enjoy relatively easy mechanics that are tough to master?  -Do you fancy yourself a leader, that likes to communicate and see his orders carried out by real people? -Do you love a game with a close tight community, where people follow the rules and everyone is willing to teach you?  If you said yes to any of these Guns of Icarus has a place for you.  -Do you not like having non transparent game mechanics? ( engines below 50% im looking at you ) -Do you not enjoy getting absolutely assblasted by people at the top tier of gameplay when you yourself are new? -Do you not enjoy a shallow tutorial? Leaving your woefully unprepared at your class job ( Pilots ) -Do you not like NOT having an option to remove disruptive persons from your ship without having to remake a lobby?  If you said yes to any of THESE things. Your early adventures into Guns of Icarus are going to be a nightmare. Beware this is not a game that you will enjoy, on your own, with no friends, to help guide you into things. Although to be fair, the community is always willing to answer questions and help you learn.  I have played this game at the highest tier of play, as Pilot, Gunner, and Engineer. Theres almost nothing else like this game out there. Its intoxicating. Knowing that your ship is a well oiled death machine of personal indiviual skill AND complete trust in your companions. When I play with my clanmates, and we get matched up against other clans of equal footing, its indescribable. Sticking through the learning curve and getting to that lvl of play takes honest time effort and repition.   When I play for fun ( which is all I do nowadays ) I find that matchmaking is underperforming, claiming that a hidden MMR rating is used to match me up against people that have had this game for a couple days, whereas I've put over 1000 hours into this game. DISREGARD ALL PRETENSE OF MMR in public lobbies. There is none or near enough as to make no difference.   If you buy the game, find a clan of people that seem friendly and play often. and just learn the game from them. There are weekly and bi weekly tournaments that are streamed on Twitch, Community fights VS the Developers where the winners get FREE item choice from the store ( pretty awesome tbh )  Almost forgot the steam workshop, where player created items are hand picked by the community to appear in game, if your creative. You could put your hand to work designing cosmetic items that could charge for or let go up for free. Its your choice. In my opinion the process of created work waiting review VS getting it into the game takes way too long. Some of these created icons look simply A-M-A-Z-I-N-G and need to be in the game right meow.  Gonna wrap this up before I start rambling.   TLDR:  -New players are going to suck for a DAMN LONG time unless you get knowledge from higher lvl players. -Hard to enjoy on your own, que with friends.  -This games community is the best I have ever encountered in 14 years of video gaming. ( besides new players spamming dumb ♥♥♥♥ in global, I promise you they are the minority ) -Easy to learn, difficult to master mechanics, ( when charged ammo is better in a mortar then greased )  -Community events out the ♥♥♥. Get free stuff. -The top tier of gameplay is deeply rewarding on a personal lvl, and the memories of your triumphs will go with you to the grave.   This is just my TWO SILVER CENTS. that I decided to leave because I hate seeing stupid reviews saying Oh dis gaem is best buy it!",

            "review_text": "*EDIT* I'm very sorry this is not really a review, but more of a purrsonal experience.  Especially as female gamer in a voice chat centered game, I was scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I usually played games where I could avoid being identified as a woman, obviously, because video games are still a very hostile environment for a female identified creature. Guns of Icarus surprised me. Maybe because it's a team effort game. Maybe because valuable exchange of information and getting along is the only way to make any progress at in GoIO all. Maybe because the developers are actively engaging with us constantly. Or maybe because it's hard to single people out, since everything stays a group effort or a collective failure. This game has been proven over and over again, to be about teamwork and helping each other out. Never have I seen a community welcome beginners so warmly, teaching newcomers is almost exciting to us. I have seen experienced players leave a full lobby, just to show a new player the ropes in the Practice Match (called Sandbox), and I am very proud to admit to be one of them. If you are gonna start this game you are gonna make a lot of friends. That's not a warning. That's a treat!  *EDIT* Please don't add me randomly. I am more than happy to help you ingame, but I use my steam for Clan contacts and friends only.",

            "review_text": "Floating warships duking it out in the skies of an apocolyptic wasteland. All in awesome steampunk fashion! 4 man crews, 7 different ships, 17(ever expanding) weapons to outfit them.  Flamethrowers and mortars and mines, oh my! Ships that range from hulky Galleon tanks, to fast and nimble Squids. Come in loud and proud, or pester the enemy to death. There's a good variety to have fun with.  A simple concept, it's easy to learn but hard to master. It's class based: pilot/engineer/gunner.  Ships have predefined weapon placements, but you're free to select what weapons to fit(depending on if its a heavy or light weapons spot). -Pilots do nothing but fly and bark orders! :D  -An Engineers job consists of repairing/rebuilding/extinguishing fires/upgrading components, and sometimes spotting hostiles.  -The Gunners class is self-explanatory, but will often overlap with Engineers duty. But, it's unique because youre allowed to choose 3 different ammo types, which can be invaluable if you learn how to use them. +Now all classes have stamina that give them unique abiities!  There are several components aboard evey ship; balloons, engines, weapons, and the hull. They can all be damaged and destroyed by an enemy. You learn what parts are priorities, or when you need to shoot instead of repair. It's very important to know what weapon and ammo type to use at any given time. This is the skill of the game, this will all ultimately decide the fate of a battle.  When it all works out, it's an experience that leaves you feeling satisfied.  The weapons are all fantastic and totally diverse. Some will trade off raw power to be better equipped at taking out certain components, so you have to feel them out and equip your ship accordingly. There is almost nothing more gratifying than hosing down an enemy ship with flamethrowers and just watching them BUUUURRRNNN!  Although, seeing an enemies futilile attempt at burning yours after youve chem-sprayed, is even more rewarding... The Hwacha in particuliar is pretty frikken awesome too ; ) The weapons are just flat-out  fun  to use. Which is great, because that's what the whole game revolves around - shooting down your enemy.    Cooperation is crucial, however, not always necessary if you have a competent crew. Coordination is also key. If you can get together some friends, it can make for some incredibly fun battles, some of the best you can have online imo. I mean, who doesnt like being the crew of a well-oiled killing machine!? The game is very balanced, and the only thing that is OP is communication.  Graphics arent too great, sometimes they're kinda lackluster. The audio is pretty well done, with just some minor gripes here and there. All-in-all, for $3 it's a fkn steal. I never pay full price, but this game is worth a lot more than a few dollars.  If you havent tried it, DO IT! everyone at least likes it for a little while.  If you havent played in a while, come back and see the new changes. Theyve added a lot!  Now with steam workshop!!",

            "review_text": "My first experience, in One session: I went through all the tutorial stuff first, And I found the concepts to be very simple. I decorated my character to how I pleased with what I had. After that, it was gametime. I had a friend introduce me into the ship types and gun types, as well as what each class would do at all times. We joined an online game, and was put with 2 other people- A gunner and a Pilot. The ship was a Squid. We had a flamer and gattling, and Frankly, that was all we needed. The pilot Blew at his job... So I jacked the wheel. The control was so easy to finesse, to turn and raise was elegant, timely, and gave me plenty of time and ability to work with my gunners' needs. my friend managed the engines, hull, and balloon like a beast, and the pilot was upset I upstaged him (By far.) After that, I found another pilot, my friend left after another game, and I was on my own with this Pilot, a badass gunner, and a random second engineer. We lost 2, won 5.  And it was, without a doubt, the most fun and enjoyment I have ever had from an online, player to player combat experience.  I would recommend, No, I would Require, everyone I know, to at least learn of this game at one point in their lifetime.",

            "review_text": "I'd love to love this game. And I've really tried -- for over 1000 hours. But I just can't anymore. An *extremely* under-experienced (yet incredibly friendly!) development team leads to a very unpolished game, with an ongoing and haphazardly drastic development process. Due to constant 'rebalancing' patches, it's very different than when I purchased it, and not in a good way.  The game itself revolves around three asymmetric roles. They are generally played fairly straight forward, and are each arguably shallow. Pilots (should) stand at the wheel ~99% of the time, just flying the ship and mostly disconnected from the on-deck action. Engineers and gunners will spend most of their time firing a single weapon (possibly two) or repeatedly clicking on ship components using a limited variety of tools.  Teamwork and communication are the real name of the game, so if you don't plan on being an active participant of in-game voice chat, I'd entirely skip this game. Dealing with uncooperative or non-responsive teammates can be very frustrating, and is a serious problem in battle. Obviously, this lends a large advantage to pre-made teams, as coordination between members is more important than any one role.  This leads to a few 'interesting' problems. New players will stand nearly no chance against experienced teams. This can be quite unpleasant for new players, and is unfortunately very common. However, the experienced teams themselves have an equally hard time finding a balanced match. There is no matchmaking system for teams [nor do I believe there will ever be a way to properly quantify teamwork/communication over role performance]. This leads to LONG WAIT TIMES between matches (~1/2 of my logged hours were spent in lobby), very unbalanced matches, and general frustration from both new players and experienced crews.  On a technical level, it plays no better than a solid beta; Graphics are fairly poor, yet somehow not fully optimized, and net code leaves a lot to be desired. Poor graphical performance and frequent lag spikes are par for the course. I have an average PC with good broadband, and still sporadically get crap for both FPS and ping, with potentially serious impact on game play. Syncing errors leaving you unable to interact with the ship, and bugs with 'Steam's' voice servers that make you unable to verbally communicate are far too common. This game has been out for over a year and dealing very basic things like these are still on the 'To-Do' list.  Development cycle is also more like a beta than a final product. Constant and irregularly released patches address the endless sea of old and newly created bugs. They often include ***extreme*** 're-balancing' of ANY aspect of the game (from lobby structure to a complete overhaul of physics, and every stat inbetween), or sometimes add new content. The game is not and has not ever been stable, either in code or in game balance in the first place. Any changes or additions to the game often make these preexisting problems worse. Unfortunately, more often than not, the added content is entirely useless or strategically ignorable.  There are those who will sing the chorus 'The community is great! The development team is so involved!' I will concede that this is the friendliest development team I've ever seen. That does not mean that they are the most professional. As a result, the game has some wonderful qualities and ideas that are put into execution rather poorly. A large part of the reason why the community is 'great' is entirely artificial, due to strict behavioral guidelines. Trolling, profanity, harassment will all get you heavily censored or kicked/banned from the game. This is not at all an idle threat, and moderators are often extremely biased towards veteran players.  But... If you've read all this, you've probably already made up your mind. And thats fine! If you THINK you'll like it, you'll probably enjoy it for a good while despite its very obvious and glaring flaws, even though I no longer can. If you do enjoy it, remember the game can change entirely at any moment with a new 'balance' patch. Have fun while it lasts, and tell the ducks dragonmere says quack off! ;-)",

And, when they aren't trying to convince rookies that all crew members should switch over to gunners, they are very helpful. One of my favorite things about this game is the fact everyone is on a level playing field. My crew and I have butchered higher level players and yes, we've all been creamed by lower level rookies, but that is what makes this game fun.

It's a genuine idea that's been executed very well thus far. I'll continue:  The absolute best gaming community I have ever seen, the most amazing implementation of teamwork, and the stunning originality of games is all right here, Guns of Icarus online.   The gaming world nowadays lacks ingenuity, and really needs well thought out games that are very different than the others, I find that Guns of Icarus did this spot on. I admit, at first I had my scepticisms. I didn’t see how a steampunk game where you fly blimps and fight each other in the skies would work, it seemed bizarre to me. Then I actually played the game, it’s finally a great idea that was executed well.   Caring developers, kind community members, perhaps the most welcoming game in the world to beginners and new players, and the level of teamwork that they planned to implement into this astounds me.   I can’t really explain how much of an enjoyable experience this is, all I can say is, this is a must buy and you have to play it yourself to understand what I am talking about.  I haven't played this game as long as most, but I assure you my hours will only be going up. With the coming addition of Alliance, I trust this game will be as good as ever.

Admins and developers are also very friendly and regulary play with the players, talking to them and responding to every question they have.  The game itself has a very nice steampunky feel and despite it having 'only' 3 classes, there is no shortage of fun. There is a role for everyone, and the 3 available classes will keep you occupied for a long time.  Each ship can be customized, every class can choose from a variety of tools to take into the game and once there, there is really no shortage of tactics involved. Will you be able to outsmart your opponents and be a superior crew because of your internal organisation?  As far as the visuals go, game is made to be really pretty. Despite it having good and somewhat demanding graphics it is mostly totaly lag free and runs incredibly smooth. if your computer is a bit on the slow side, you can always try lowering the quality and removing some of the filters.

            "review_text": "I got this game in a Humble Bundle.  This is an online, team-based steampunk game where 4-prople crews battle it out on flying boats for number of kills or capture points.  As a player, you have 3 characters, each with a different role, and can switch them between matches. Customization includes clothing, hairdos, and a series of items/ammo/boosts classified by roles. The heart of every ship is the captain, who needs to steer the ship, draw strategy and communicate effectively with the rest of the crew and allied captains. A skilled captain is crucial to success. Their items deal with driving the ship and finding enemies. Meanwhile, Engineers are the lifeblood that keep the makeshift boats flying. While it's usually the dullest role, it's crucial to avoid early termination. Their objects all deal with repairing the ship, with a bit of buffing. Finally, Gunners are the easiest path to learning the game. While it's very easy to set on a gun and shoot at enemies, the skill ceiling, range finding and ammo selection make it a more nuanced task. Incomplete crews get manned by AI, who are slightly competent at their jobs but lack the adaptability of actual players.  While the game has everything it needs, there's a slight lack of map variety and game styles. It would be awesome to have a scavenger hunt match type (digging into the theme of salvaged relics from wastelands), and a boss-style battle against giant ships manned by foreign potencies. Weapon and ship balance has been an ongoing stuggle, as minmaxers find overpowered matches, and a few ships with proven effective loadouts are the norm. Still, the game gets frequent updates and rebalances. The worst part is the small playerbase. Would be awesome if this could get more players to populate the server.",

            "review_text": "Captain's Log Day One: After many years as an officer in the Royal Air navy, mostly commanding the guns, I have finally been promoted to the rank of Post-Captain and I have been given my first command. My first command is to be 'The Maelstrom' a beautiful, new, Goldfish. The guns are in good order, the engines are working like a dream, and it comes with an excellent crew of loyal, hardy, and well disciplined Sailors and Officers. I look forward to making a name for myself with this ship.  Captain's Log Day Two: We were given commerce raiding duties in the Fjords along with a small Flotilla of two Pyramidions, one Spire, and one Junker. We managed to take several merchant ships without a fight but then came upon several enemy vessels. The Pyramidions rushed forward and acted as the vanguard while myself and the Junker stayed farther back. The Pyramidions received heavy damage as the enemies had, unknown to us until now, a Galleon. Using my ship's heavy weapons, we disabled its engines and guns, and it was finally taken down by our Junker. With their flagship lost, the rest of the enemy attempted to flee. We were able to capture one Junker and one Squid. We sailed back to port with out prizes in tow, and gave our report to the Admiralty. We were given many commendations, and I myself was gifted with an engraved sword. We will remain at port for a week.  Captain's Log Day Nine: My Men drank, sang, and ♥♥♥♥♥d the week away, spending most of their pay. I, meanwhile, spent most of the week in my Cabin, quietly reading and going over charts and ledgers. The prize money, when split amongst the three Captains was still a substantial sum. When I awoke this morning I was given my orders. We are to intercept a raiding fleet in the Fjords.  Captain's Log Day Ten: What had happened? When my men were to supposed to report today, there were only three! My two gunners, and my engineer. My entire crew has disappeared except for the four of us! Who could fly a ship with only four men?  Captain's Log Day Eleven: The Admiralty has ignored my pleas and told me that the rest of the fleet has already left port and that I should join them. Well, I guess three men is better than none.  Captain's Log Day Eighteen: After several long days of flying, we have finally found our target. We started chasing them at eight bells this morning, and, knowing they were outnumbered, they fled. We were able to seperate three ships though, a Squid, a Pyramidion, and a Spire. Using our main gun, our heavy Hwatcha, we destroyed the Spire in a matter of minutes. The Pyramidion and Squid quickly followed suit. We attempted to find the rest of the fleet, but it seems as though these ships that now lie at the bottom of the fjord were sent to delay us while the rest of the fleet gave us the slip.  Captain's Log Day Twenty Two: I have begun to suspect that my crew has gone mad. Today we encountered an enemy Goldfish, and rather than follow my orders and do their duty, my Engineer kept trying to use the flamethrower, a weapon that he is not trained to use, when he was not manning the flamethrower, he kept trying to buff the guns while our engines were on fire. He did not, even once, repair anything. My gunner kept using the Gatling gun rather than our ship's main gun, and my other gunner just stood in one place, not moving or speaking. In fact, he didn't do anything. I firmly believe that the sun has gotten to him. We only won because of my expert piloting skills, destroying their balloon with our ship's spike.  Captain's Log Day Twenty Five: I am at my wit's end. My engineer has started talking nonsense, constantly ranting about some fellow named, 'Trump' and how he's going to ruin some strange land called 'Merica' and screaming at the top of his lungs at any other who disagrees with him. My secondary Gunner has remained in the same area. He occasionally complains about 'lag' whatever this 'lag' he speaks of is, I do not know. My first gunner always fires the Heavy Hwatcha too early, and never follows my orders, constantly calling me a '♥♥♥♥♥♥y ♥♥♥ noob.' I swear that none of these men are the original crewmen that this ship originally had.  Captain's Log Day Forty Three: I have lost all hope. It is not worth even working any more. My engineer never fixes anything anymore, my Secondary gunner has disappeared. My first gunner constantly runs around trying to fix things, while completely ignoring the guns. It is so much that I have taken to the drink in order to drown my sorrows. To make matters worse, the fleet that we missed last month has moved into our capital city and I have been called to defend the city against the onslaught. The best I can hope for now is an honorable death and to rid the world of the most incompetent sailors the sky has ever seen.  Captain's Log Day Fifty: We arrived in the city and found that an entire fleet had besieged the city. I moved into the center, hoping for an honourable death and, to my surprise, my crew performed exceptionally. They followed ever order, kept the ship running, and destroyed all of the enemy ships. My ship, the Maelstrom, has singlehandedly saved the city.  Captain's Log Day Fifty One: We have all been made heroes. Every admiral wishes to meet us, we have been given every medal for valor, we have all been given a fortune in prize money, and the Queen herself has personally knighted all of us in thanks. There have been many parades and balls in our honour. My men have all been made officers, and I have been promoted to the Rank of Rear Admiral. I know not by what power, but somehow, my crew, consisting of three people, did horribly, but finally did well when they were most needed.",

So dont blame me for making some mistakes here and there ;)  One of the best if not the best multiplayer game i have played so far. When you first enter the game lobby (yes as the title suggests its an online only game) you will probably be surprised by the low player count (50-400 people) and think the game is dying. But when you look it up on the internet (steam stats) you will find that its always been that way for years now (apart from some peeks here and there) without a big relevant overall decline in player counts. In this game you play as an engineer, captain or a gunner keeping an airship (chosen by the captain) up and running and shoot other airships or capture strategic positions. Matches are rather fast paced : 15-20minutes on average. And now i get to the pros and cons.   Just one more note: you definitely shouldnt be shy to talk to strangers via voice chat because every crewmember depends on each other to keep your airship running.  Pros: -great multiplayer game where communication between crewmembers and allied captains is key  -enough ships and weapons for several tactical variations and counters  -possibilities to either voice chat with crew, team captains (only as a captain) or all players in a lobby (not ingame)  - a very helpful community that teaches novices/new players  -small but overall friendly and helpful community (the most friendly community i have come across so far in a game)  -Community ambassadors trying to answer question (for example in global chat)  -active developers that are keen on keeping the game balanced and even add more stuff (not only tweeks, skins and clothes, there should even be more gamemodes coming up soon)  -an ideal game to find more steam friends   cons:  -the community can be pretty small at times (varies from around 50-400 people online)",

I'm just going ahead and say it: Guns of Icarus online is basically Faster Than Light multiplayer in a steampunk setting. Okay, there is no boarding or killing the enemy crew but everything else is in: destroying the armor (the shields) to do damage to the hull, destroying components to disable certain abilities of the enemy, i.e. the engines to remove their ability to maneuver.",

            "review_text": "Due to sale Currently going on at the time of this review, i decided to let my opinon be known about Guns of icarus.  GOI online is a Team-based game in which you and your crew battle other airships for supremacy of the skies.  The Major selling point for me is that i have yet to see a game quite like GOI online.Therefore on uniqueness alone i could give it a possible recommend.  The gameplay has variety, with moments ranging from fast-paced heart pumping action to slow tension building moments. Some people have complained that the gameplay can get a little slow and this is true during certain matches. It is not a twitch shooter by any means.  The Graphics:There is no ground-breaking textures to be found in GOI online, While some may dislike this, i do not mind it at all. I would describe the graphic style as Warm and inviting, Not cutting edge.  The Ships and combat of GOI are where you find the meat of the game. Each ship feels unique in the way it handles and the way you must fly and move around on it. There is a noticible difference when you go from piloting a heavy ship to a far lighter vessel. The weapons also add a lot of depth to this game with many different types of weapons and ammo that have varying effects on how your shots behave in flight.The movement of your ship and the enemies is also a factor  A word of caution to the Rambo's out there. This is a team game to the extreme.Do not expect to be a one man army in GOI. Victory requires the entire crew to communicate,Calling out enemy vessels. Directing the pilot to manuever to give you a shot,Calling out repairs etc.  If team games and Steam punk airships sound good to you i say give this little gem a try.  There is also plans by the devs to add open-world gameplay in the future. I do not know if it will happen anytime soon or ever but there is already plenty of game here for your money.",

            "review_text": "Outstanding first-person game where you are either a pilot, gunner or engineer on a 4-person steampunk airship with various weapons (gatling guns, rocket launchers, flamethrowers and more). You play in matches where a team of 2 ships fights another 2-ship team, or in larger 3v3 or 4v4 matches, set in beautiful 3D maps in various settings (arctic, desert, ruined urban landscape, canyons).  There is a bit of a learning curve at first, becoming familiar with the various ship types, rangng from the speedy Squid (which I like to think of as a 'sports car with machine guns'), to the ponderous but powerful Galleon. You also have to become familiar with the different repair tools, pilot tools, ammunition types and weapons.  This is very much a game where teamwork and communication are key - the pilot has to position the ship to work with teammates to attack enemies, the gunners mainly shoot weapons, and the engineers keep the ship alive, while also firing weapons as needed. If the crew (and team) does not work together smoothly, disaster is likely to be the result.  I've played this game for over two years, at least several days per week, so you can tell I really like it, and recommend it to anyone interested in this genre. Don't be discouraged at first when you go down in flames and your ship parts decorate the landscape, we all start somewhere :)  The people in the community are generally very helpful to new players, especially if they have good attitudes about learning new things and listen to good advice (which is true of almost anything in life, really.)

            "review_text": "An indie steampunk-themed strategy game with all the fun of guns, airships and teamwork. It cannot be stressed enough that this is a game where you work together as a team to keep the ship afloat and take down the enemy ship or capture the point.    There is a total of 3 roles which is the gunner, engineer and pilot with a total of 4 spots on each ship. Each class specialized in their role and every one of them has a stamina bar that is useful for the specific class which on default is on the Shift key. However, anyone can grab the helm to fly the ship, shoot the guns and fix the ship. So on any emergency like the captain disconnecting or engineer busy with fixing the balloon, the gunner can help steer the ship to safety and give the hull a tap.    It's extremely hard to care for a ship all alone however, especially when starting out so it's best to have 4 people on the ship to divide the work! Don't have any friends or any playing yet? No worries, the game will set you up with random players to work together and even if there is a chance a few of those spots weren't taken the AIs will help substitute those roles with the F1, F2 and F3 button to control them until the end of the match or till someone else decides to join the ship mid game.    The community is always friendly to new players as long as you're willing to listen and communicate. If you're confused don't be afraid to ask, there are community ambassadors who are specifically there to help along and many other players who will also give you advices and tips for the game.    It is highly recommended to finish the tutorial before you begin because even though it is a fairly easy game to pick up, you might not understand the tools which may frustrate not only you but other players in the middle of the match as well. There are multiple ships and guns to choose from so experiment around and accept recommendation unless you can explain why you declined it with the captain. Gunners are not the only class that can shoot guns so don't worry if the captain wants a crew with 3 engineers.    PS. There is voice chat and you may encounter a few drunk and/or high players for some oddly funny reason so have fun and be respectful of others no matter what.",

Replay Value 6/10 You can play this game forever. That would warrant a 10/10. HOWEVER, the game is not rewarding or rather, you play the same game over and over. Yes, different people make each match special. But imagine your favorite moba game. Everone has every character unlocked and there are only half as many characters. It is great fun for a while. But eventually, things get repetitive and dare I say boring.  In Game Store 10/10 Not in your face. Purely cosmetic. Perfect.  Balance 5/10 While the ships and weapons are balanced players are not. With a smaller community it can be difficult to fly with people of your level. That goes for within your own ship, and even against other players. If your engineer does not know what to repair, your gunner has bad aim, or your pilot turns your ship into a sitting target, it does not matter how good you are as an individual.  Normally, this is where matchmaking, and some sort of player skill balance comes into play. But with a smaller community, this is not exactly the best choice to segregate players.  Matchmaking 5/10 It can be difficult to get into a game. You can always find games. But, it can take a while.  Game modes 4/10 Plenty of game modes exist, and are played. I think this almost hurts the game though, because it puts players in a position of wanting to play a certain gamemode, and potentially nobody wants to play that mode. if 300 people are spread out over say 6 game modes(deathmatch,king of hill, crazy king, 2v2-3v3-4v4 etc) Not including different maps.  Thats about 50 people maybe wanting to play with you. Take into consideration about 7 matches in each game mode and you are down to about 7 people trying to do what you are doing. That assumes no1 is afk or goes afk when you are making a match.  To be fair, finding a match isnt always all that difficult. It more often than not requires a higher level of patience.  Overall 5/10 That isnt bad! It is decent, and fun will be had. It is worth a look. It is not your typical game. has its issues, but is solid fun.  With actual friends 8.5/10 Yes, there is a huge advantage to be had when playing with people you know and generally play games with. This is where the game shines. Plan to play with others, either make friends or get your friends to play with you. but fun will be had.",

            "review_text": "  Overall positive but I'll look at both sides.  What does GoI Online do right?  Great team mechanics - if you're looking for a LAN party game, something to play with a small group of friends online or if you just want to enjoy a team game where you have to work and communicate with other players, it's a perfect game for you. You seriously cannot win in this game without co-ordination between crew members, so it's perfect for that sort of dynamic.  Relatively good graphics - the textures are nothing special in GoI, but a lot of the video effects used can give a great atmosphere. Not only that, but the entire design of the game is fantastic. Every ship and map has its own unique look and feel.  Awesome sound design - There isn't a lot of music in the game, but where it does feature, it's great. Sound effects are also awesome. When battles get intense, you feel it, especially when you have good headphones.  Great concept - the actual idea of GoI is awesome and unique, and something I'm surprised more companies and developers haven't tried to capitalise on. More games like it are springing up, but GoI is still a very unique and exclusive experience. There isn't a game quite like this anywhere else  Now, the downsides.  Low population - probably GoI's most prominent flaw is its low player count. There simply aren't a lot of people playing this game compared to when it was first released, and that's especially bad when you've got a multiplayer game where players are far more valuable than AI. I've experienced instances where one lobby has left and disbanded, only for all of the same players to form up in a different lobby since nobody else is online. You'll see this happen a lot and it can be monotonous.  Long grind - you do get levels, achievements and collectibles in this game, and gaining all of them can be brutal and long. Your levels are divided between three different classes, so you have to level all three to stay competitive, meaning you can't just focus one class and hope for the best. You will spend a lot of time in this game putting effort in and still getting little as a result other than the actual gameplay experience.  Lack of depth - GoI has a solid framework, but behind that, there isn't that much. Little to no lore, no expansion on regions or ships, and also a very basic meta. Some guns counter some stuff, others counter other stuff. It's as simple as that 90% of the time. No combinations or workarounds like in other games like this. Get ready to pick a style and keep it, chances are everyone else is playing the same way. This is also an issue when you consider the price of this game. I was fortunate enough to receive this game as a gift, but I have friends who refuse to buy the game simply because some things (lore, story, gameplay depth) aren't there, and don't justify the price tag for them.  Overall, GoI is a fantastic game, but it is lacking in features which I wish the developers would work on. And honestly, considering the lack of a large playerbase and the lack of effort being put towards the game by the devs, I wouldn't be surprised if this game goes F2P in the near future. Personally, I think it should, this game needs an influx of new players badly. Still, a fun game, and it definitely has features you may be looking for.  7/10",

Teamwork is a must in this game as you work together to give the ship life and flight. The devs of the game are nice, helpful, and can also been seen often in the chat when not busy working to improve the game or listenning to feeback. The community has also been very good and you will rarely ever find a troll in my experience. I can also safely say the game is not pay 2 win due to the fact the cashsop is only cosmetics. All you need to do is pick a role or even swap roles, pick a ship and the parts you like, or pick your ammo and head out to earn your fame.",

Lack of boarding, and hand-to-hand combat really emphasize teamwork, and if you don't have a good team, you are screwed.  Some of the things I dislike are mostly minor, and I think will be fixed with time. The graphics are good, but on certain maps, (i.e. any with rain, or fog) I feel like it was poorly done. Also, the lack of game modes begins to get to you after a while, but they are working on adventure mode, the DLC for which i will definitely buy. On the whole, I would give it a 7/10, and I would love to give it more, but it is not the kind of game you could lose yourself in.  I built up a ton of expectation about this one, and while unrealistic, it feels slightly like a letdown. But it will get better, and what they have now is impressive. Good work guys.",

Gunners are obviously responsible for shooting the enemies, destorying parts on their ships, and ultimately their goal is to kill them. There are many different guns and ammo types. Of course, for different gun different ammo is needed because it works in the gun better and is more effective at destorying the enemy. Typically your captain will suggest ammo but you may want to ask them what they want. OH, and always check the captains ship load out so you can see what guns are on there and if you already know what ammo works best equip it and double check with captain. Engis are like the glue of the whole airship, they are responsible for rebuilding parts on ship that have been destroyed, restoring health to damaged ship parts, and putting out fires, buffing equipment etc. The captain is the ships 'brains', they steer the ship, use their captain tools to make the ship go faster, higher etc. Its loads of fun to play with your friends because it is an online mutliplayer you are always playing with people, making new friends. It also has clans that you can join and become part of their extended family and things.   Its quite fun and i'd recommended any one buy it when it is onsale, seeing as its a good use of money and can be played for hours on end. I'd also recommend doing the tutorial b/c ppl get mad at new players often for just jumping on into games especially when they don't listen to load out recommendations or seem to know what they are doing on the ship. Plus doing the tutorial gives you a better understand of the classes and their specific roles on the ship.",

Gunners are obviously responsible for shooting the enemies, destorying parts on their ships, and ultimately their goal is to kill them. There are many different guns and ammo types. Of course, for different gun different ammo is needed because it works in the gun better and is more effective at destorying the enemy. Typically your captain will suggest ammo but you may want to ask them what they want. OH, and always check the captains ship load out so you can see what guns are on there and if you already know what ammo works best equip it and double check with captain. Engis are like the glue of the whole airship, they are responsible for rebuilding parts on ship that have been destroyed, restoring health to damaged ship parts, and putting out fires, buffing equipment etc. The captain is the ships 'brains', they steer the ship, use their captain tools to make the ship go faster, higher etc. Its loads of fun to play with your friends because it is an online mutliplayer you are always playing with people, making new friends. It also has clans that you can join and become part of their extended family and things.   Its quite fun and i'd recommended any one buy it when it is onsale, seeing as its a good use of money and can be played for hours on end. I'd also recommend doing the tutorial b/c ppl get mad at new players often for just jumping on into games especially when they don't listen to load out recommendations or seem to know what they are doing on the ship. Plus doing the tutorial gives you a better understand of the classes and their specific roles on the ship.",

But you can easily just turn of the option and starting fighting people and piloting and using your own gun enplacements.  Bewared its best to fight against some novice matches to understand and learn.  Pros: + no serious grinding. You get all the guns and ships off the bat if you turn the novice options off. + fun team game like TF2. + easy controls.   Cons: - griniding if you want to level up for your epenis. leveling up gives you cosmetic clothing for your character and dye like the paints of TF2.  - Leveling up system. its not by xp or winning. Its done by doing achievements. Some achievements wants you to rebuild an engine. I will thus instead of fixing the engine I let it get destroyed to farm my achievements. Leads to players wanting to be self serving but this not an issue from most people I noticed.  - personal opinon. Game play design. A terrible crew/pilot will lead one player being the full time engineer to fix, buff, rebuild like a slave. While everyone else gets to shoot or pilot. Unless you enjoy clicking at stuff all the time. You will playing support role all the time running from bow to stern fixing ♥♥♥♥. Atleast your a team player I guess.",

Joining a clan will help you develop a group of people that you can play with and that you know you can rely on.   I’m not going to go into too many details about the gameplay, but the rough overview is that you have one pilot who moves the ship and communicates with allied pilots. You also have three other crewmembers that fire guns and repair components on the ship. There are different ships, gun loadouts, ammo types, tool loadouts, etc. to choose from.  Cosmetics can be purchased, but provide no gameplay advantages.  The playerbase is usually small (a couple hundred people online at most), although in the aftermath of sales it can be much greater.

Like any game where you play with strangers, you run into the occasional jerk but they are in the vast minority. The different roles and ships combine to make for a highly varied experience The matchmaking system seems to be about right on, producing close matches and nail-biting conclusions. Best team PvP game since Quake Wars.  And important stuff about actual gameplay aside, it's pretty too. The whole steampunk Zeppelin fighting thing is absurd but it's just far enough out to let you gloss over things like how hull-armor is a machine you repair but not so far out that if feels silly or arbitrary like if it was some kind of magic spell you were maintaining.  I cannot more strongly reccomend playing.",

The first thing you do is to pick a name (like any other game). I recomend to pick something you can role play around, this game´s community is really good a at that (The community is really good at most things). I picked Captain Kirk.  The gameplay is actually really simple. You and your crew are on a airship and will try to shoot down the enemies airship. It sounds simple and it is simple. But when you get to the higher levels there is alot more strategy involved. The gameplay have a really good depth, simple in the beginning but there is still alot to learn and master.  The best part of the game must be the community that plays it. They are all very helpfull towards new players. Some of the best moments I have experiences I have had in the game is when you are just cruising the skies searching for enemies. I stand there at the helm shouting meaningless orders to the crew to ready the warp engines and to charge the ion torpedoes and they answer with the same roleplay. Or that one time we found a tomato plant on the ship and we just stood there discussing it´s backstory. The game is full with those moments.  I highly recommend that you and a few friends buy this game (if you don´t have friends there is no need to worry, you can easily find some in the game). Just make sure you have a mic, the voice-chat is half of the experience in my opinion.",

            "review_text": "Guns of Icarus Online is a refreshingly unique experience that deserves some attention. The game plays out by pitting several 4-player crews against each other in team-based airship battles. Every member of the crew has a role to fill and your success or failure depends entirely on you crews ability to function as a cohesive unit. Engineers will repair the damage your ship takes in combat, pilots fly the ship and are responsible for lining up shots, and gunners keep the pressure on the enemy. There is a good variety of ships to choose from each with their own strengths and weaknesses, and a multitude of weapons which can be slotted in different locations on the ship. Creating the right ship build with the right crew consistently yeilds a satisfying result. That said a twitch shooter this is not. The weapons are slow to fire and slower to reload, coordination is everything and there is absolutely no room for lone wolf tactics in this game. If you are looking for a game that rewards patience and teamwork look no further, pick up the 4-pack and invite some friends. If you feel like giving the devs a little more support there is an in-game cash shop as well but it only contains cosmetic items. Character unlocks are purely cosmetic as well meaning no player will be at a competitive disadvantage, save for tackling the games initial learning curve. I have been very happy with the game's balance thus far with the one exception that the random spawn locations during objective based matches can be wildly unfair (and that too many players fly the noobie Pyramideon and Goldfish ships but thats just a personal gripe). The community as a whole has been very helpfull and fun to interact with and the developers have made it clear that there are big things in store for the future of the game. This game could have easily been a pay-to-win copy &amp; paste frag fest but instead the developers made something truely special. If it wasn't clear already I highly recommend this game and hope to see you in the skies.",

I consider myself in the bottom category, despite a seemingly low play time (reasons for that are further down).  There is a reason that there is the option to buy a 4-pack of this game. It's designed as something to work together with friends on, something to work together with as mates to improve and better yourself. Nothing is more fun than taking down an enemy when you've tried and done your best with your mates. Because this game is what every multiplayer game should aspire to be - FUN. Some of the most fun I've had has been playing GoI in matches which I've lost. Because both sides put up a good fight, and it was a fair and close match, and we had fun, we enjoyed ourselves and made jokes whilst everything was on fire. Some games can go on for 10 minutes. Some can go on for 45. It all depends on the skill, ability and teamwork of the crews. The longer a match is, generally the more fun it is, and the better it is.  The community is fantastic for new players. You will, of course, get the occasional salty player, but if you are willing to learn, then 95% of players are willing to teach you. Just for god's sake use a microphone and headset, and don't argue with your captain. This game is built on teamwork, and if you don't get unlucky and get people who aren't willing to work, you will enjoy yourself immensely. The Devs are great as well. They regularly play against everyone else, and are always working on improving and fixing the game. It's come a long way.  Sadly I don't have as much time to play this game as I would like. Mostly due to being dragged into playing other games by friends who would normally crew with me. But if I could, I would be up there with the other players on playtime of hundreds of hours. It feels like I have played more though. I have sat down with my friends irl, had conversations whilst playing other games about tactics for GoI, about which gun to use on which ship, what strategy to employ based on which loadout.  This game does have a steep learning curve, I will admit. You will play at the beginning, think it is very fun but not too complex. You'll have some fun, and maybe get a few kills/wins if you're lucky. Then comes the point where a lot of people who bought the game will leave, hence the large gap in playtimes. Because those people realise that the game is more complex than they first thought, that it requires a little more time and thought than they perhaps have imagined. But those players who stick through that do NOT regret it. There's a reason why the playtimes on this game are so flipping high - because once you're past that point, you enjoy it way too much to give up! There is no experience more fun playing a game than working like a well-oiled machine with a crew of friends to clinch a win in a hard-fought match of Guns Of Icarus.  If you buy this game, expect to reach that point. Expect to reach the point where you think 'Hmmm, I'm not sure I want to play this any more.'. But I would highly, HIGHLY recommend sticking past that point, investing a little into it. The game isn't as shallow and simple as it may first seem, and once you've seen the true GoI, you will never go back.",

            "review_text": "This game has two types of players:  Those who play for a few hours and then give up. Those who play for hours upon hours upon hours.  I consider myself in the bottom category, despite a seemingly low play time (reasons for that are further down).  There is a reason that there is the option to buy a 4-pack of this game. It's designed as something to work together with friends on, something to work together with as mates to improve and better yourself. Nothing is more fun than taking down an enemy when you've tried and done your best with your mates. Because this game is what every multiplayer game should aspire to be - FUN. Some of the most fun I've had has been playing GoI in matches which I've lost. Because both sides put up a good fight, and it was a fair and close match, and we had fun, we enjoyed ourselves and made jokes whilst everything was on fire. Some games can go on for 10 minutes. Some can go on for 45. It all depends on the skill, ability and teamwork of the crews. The longer a match is, generally the more fun it is, and the better it is.  The community is fantastic for new players. You will, of course, get the occasional salty player, but if you are willing to learn, then 95% of players are willing to teach you. Just for god's sake use a microphone and headset, and don't argue with your captain. This game is built on teamwork, and if you don't get unlucky and get people who aren't willing to work, you will enjoy yourself immensely. The Devs are great as well. They regularly play against everyone else, and are always working on improving and fixing the game. It's come a long way.  Sadly I don't have as much time to play this game as I would like. Mostly due to being dragged into playing other games by friends who would normally crew with me. But if I could, I would be up there with the other players on playtime of hundreds of hours. It feels like I have played more though. I have sat down with my friends irl, had conversations whilst playing other games about tactics for GoI, about which gun to use on which ship, what strategy to employ based on which loadout.  This game does have a steep learning curve, I will admit. You will play at the beginning, think it is very fun but not too complex. You'll have some fun, and maybe get a few kills/wins if you're lucky. Then comes the point where a lot of people who bought the game will leave, hence the large gap in playtimes. Because those people realise that the game is more complex than they first thought, that it requires a little more time and thought than they perhaps have imagined. But those players who stick through that do NOT regret it. There's a reason why the playtimes on this game are so flipping high - because once you're past that point, you enjoy it way too much to give up! There is no experience more fun playing a game than working like a well-oiled machine with a crew of friends to clinch a win in a hard-fought match of Guns Of Icarus.  If you buy this game, expect to reach that point. Expect to reach the point where you think 'Hmmm, I'm not sure I want to play this any more.'. But I would highly, HIGHLY recommend sticking past that point, investing a little into it. The game isn't as shallow and simple as it may first seem, and once you've seen the true GoI, you will never go back.",

It's difficult to play in a public game a lot of the time since people tend not to listen (like any game that requires teamwork) but it really shines when you can put together a good crew who can communicate. Every player in a 4-man crew has a large impact on the outcome of the game and it feels very well-balanced.  The game is well-made, with a good range of PC options and it really shows what the Unity engine is capable of.

The balloon is spread over the ship, Chief is working hard on fixing the feeder but this might be the last time I have the chance of holding a pen, or anything else for what it is worth, in my hand. The Reds sent a squid forward, we know their spire is somewhere on top, looking for a clue. It has been a good flight this far and if I want to give an hint to whoever is going to read this, then I must begin from where I began too.  I started as a second engi aboard the pyramideon of Capitan Silentkill: the Sovereign. A fine ship prow to stern doing rounds over the coast. I was assigned front gun deck left, manned an unwieldy and slow mortar with which I shot at a fair amount of clouds. Behind me a damned balloon engine too old for its purpose that whined and caught fire all the time. It was rough, I felt more often than not an idiot but I killed gals and 'fishes and kept the whole shack afloat more often than not. I remember them as the easy times, oh. My Cap't loved it up, close and personal, ramming into opponent and the likes of anything in front of us so that we were quite successful in our trade. Then while we were ashore he dropped below cloud-line and I found myself again spending time at the Lobby, watching my weathered timepiece rise and dive in a circular motion. I had some cash saved up, I wanted more, I took a ship: the crankiest, dustied, smelliest piece of rust ever able to lift, the Good Chance. My Good Chance.  A junker in name, smell and look, it is with unabated love that i feel the old deck beneath my feet, the splintery wheel, the sputtering engines devouring any fuel that we fed them and the armor added in the years that now the youngest engi is frantically putting together again. Just like I was then, my engis are today again the life force of the Chance: adrenaline junkies hopping around like squirrels, hammering with no pause to this fragile, beautiful heap of junk we call home. Oh and firing the killing shots. Anything else that comes out of my ship is thanks to her. Chief and Crop don't give me anymore side glances when that demon spawn of our gunner screams above the harrowing noise of machinery to “Lift the clunker dammit!. They don't pause a step anymore when she screams from below deck “gimme a dammit fire arch you poor excuse of a pilot!”. My gunner is my teeth and I like her just the way she is: the meanest, angriest, tobacco-chewing godless assassin I could ever be blessed to have on board, raining machine gun fire on our foes and opening them to a deadly salvo from the deck.  We are family, we are happy, we are dangerous and I promise that as soon as we get this balloon up we are going to show that squid up there the color of blood and the taste of defeat.  We lift, then.

So basically, if you want a deep strategical experience, you'll get it. If you don't, you can ignore the potential depth and just follow simple and direct orders.  The only con I can think of right now is the lack of earned cosmetical items. I'm OK with microtransactions (depending on what game we're talking about), but it would be a bit more fun and rewarding to actually be able to earn some items. Also, the dye system is really painfully strict. Be careful with them as they are limited, unlike GW2, for example. But these are obviously not hurting the game itself.  Overall, recommended, especially if you're a group looking for some great co-op action.",

I played Engineer and it's like a ton of clicking with the mouse. Sometimes the entire session, just sitting by the shield/hall or ballon and just repair during battle. Commander needs to provide Gunner the right angle and the Engineer needs to keep up the entire ship, balloon, engines, guns, hall/shield. IMO, all class should have some kind of repair tool because even with 2 engineers, it's really hard to keep the ship afloat when your commander dives into enemy trap like a newbie or the gunner can't shoot and engineer can't do anything else besides cleaning up the mess and keeping everything functional. This is a huge huge responsibility for whoever plays the engineer. I mean the same principal is true in games like TF2. You got to help the Medic or Engineers. Anyway, this game is pretty good. The updates fixed a lot of bugs. There's no inbalance. I wish there were more than 4 crew member per team, but that's just the way it is. The community isn't too hostile to newbie. Mainly because of a secret ranking they use to place you with people close to your skill level. So yeah, I would buy it. There's plenty of people playing online. I don't see any lag and it's a fun but intense game.  Update: This is a REALLY intense game. If you start playing more and getting into teams with people who are really good at it, oh man it is stressful. I never played a game this intense before.",

In 12 or so hours, I have not met a single a*hole, troll or flamer. As I was learning the game there were always some nice players to explain me how to play and give tips.  This is a co-op PvP game where communication is key. You are 4 onboard an airship, the pilot chooses the layout of the ship, communicates with other airships and controls the craft, wihlst the 3 crewmembers man the guns and repairs broken parts. The 2 roles require different skills to play but they all require communication and coordination to achieve success.  The game looks great and the atmosphere can get pretty tense, as you navigate the fog searching for your enemies with the spyglass. Coordinated attacks with fellow airships (fights are usually 8v8 or 12v12) can get pretty tactical and exciting, as you scramble to get a good angle on the enemy whilst simultaneously repairing your burning ship before it falls down in flames.  Each game lasts about 10~20minutes on average so it's great for a few casual battles and again, the community is probably the best thing about this game.  Also at this really low pricetag you can't really go wrong!",

There are so many loading screens you start to think you are being trolled. Even after the game launches you still have like three loading/wait screens. I had 2 hours played on this and only 15 minutes of those were actually playing the game. the rest was waiting to load a game, find a game, figure out the GUI.  I think the game is a valiant effort and I would like to see games like this in the future.

As a beginner in any such game, feelings of inadequacy are to be expected, but having each member of your team knowing almost second-by-second just how inept I am at this game, whether they're nice about it or not, makes me feel uncomfortable the entire time I play. Since you need other players on the other team to play against, I could either take on other people by myself with a crew of AI, which wouldn't help me at all because I'd have no one to learn from on my team.  If this game had a complete offline campaign with a little plot, characters, learning the gameplay elements, and playing the different roles on the ship, that could be totally awesome, but as it is, I have a tough time getting behind games that are entirely multiplayer versus, and that feeling of being scrutinized in a game at every moment is too unnerving for me to feel comfy playing this title. If these aren't issues for you, you might enjoy this game, because it's not a terrible product or anything.

Seriously though, it takes way too long for a match to start (about 10 minutes after majority of people queue). The success of the ship is dependent on the crew working together, which rarely happens. People regularly get frustrated and leave which means the 'wander around, shoot at air' AI takes over (causing previous point). Of the 15ish matches I've been in only 3-4 have been enjoyable/even-matched. Most of the time you just get blown up by three ships at once or pointlessly try get the crew to gang up on a ship.

There is customisation for your avatars as well though a majority of the customisation is available through a cash shop you can still get some free items though progressing. There are team battles of 2 v 2 or 3 v 3 and a capture the hill/control type mode which requires you to defend points and rack up points by controlling the area(s). This game is an MMO so community is a massive factor. From what I have seen you can get some good people in your team but from my experience it’s extremely rare to and the majority of players seem to be elitist ♥♥♥♥♥♥ who want nothing more than to win and will actually join games with new players and low ranked players just to dominate them completely as a clan. After the clan wins they will clear out the match because no one will stick around to play with people like that and it drives away the community and you can often find yourself in an empty match just after one game. I personally had an issue with a high ranking clan that joined the game bearing in mind I had played two previous matches in the same lobby with them prior but all of the sudden we start exchanging insults when I wouldn’t swap with one captain’s friend so he began to throw mines (which is the only weapon that can team kill) around my ship and having the two ships on the enemy team on his side they all began to destroy my ship so I simply quit the game. I reported the individuals who were involved but no action was taken which led me to believe that moderation was non-existant. I also made a thread about it on the community page to which the clan began to spam the thread and even a moderator for the community also joined in so realising that the community was a ‘circle-jerk’ I gave up and wrote my previous review. Only once the developers saw this they decided to take action on my reports when really they should monitor their game better. Over all the core game is good but it is completely ruined by the community and until there is some way to separate ranks or at least have the option to and the developers monitor their game better I cannot recommend this game to anyone but hey if you’re an elitist try-hard who enjoys different levels of strategy and heavy communication team play you may enjoy it.",

My first match was spent flying around the map for a good while, until we were randomly shot down. Yeah, loads of fun there.   It seems like the game more or less   forces   you to be with actual friends, because playing with strangers is pretty difficult, for both parties.  Numerous times, I've seen obvious clans stacked up, who then demolish a team of strangers. Maybe that's fun to them, but to me not so much.   This game seemed awesome, but it fails short for me.",

Communicating over Teamspeak, myself and 3 others spent several hours working together and co-ordinating our actions and gun positions to eliminate the enemy airships. The feeling one receives when everyone's shouting out 'GO FOR THE BALLOON! THE BALLOON! IT'S SINKING! GO FOR THE HULL!' is pure joy and adrenaline. The different weapons that we can bring to bear against our foes, and the rush of getting a full broadside of both flamethrower and rocket launcher against an enemy airship I've not seen the likes of since this game.  The graphics in game are good (especially when you consider the price) and the atmosphere, from the creaking of the ship, the the sounds it makes as it slowly rotates to bring its cannons to bear; is one that I've been unable to experience again in any game - whether it be a AAA title or not. In game animations of the characters is somewhat lacking, and likewise, the ability to clip straight through players is a somewhat odd design decision (everything else is so immersive - why dissuade that notion?).  The weakest point of this game for me, is that there's very little point in playing if you don't have some good friends on hand, and Teamspeak or Skype etc. to easily communicate with them. Playing this by yourself, especially with a PUG is a downright travesty when you consider just how excellent this game is with a fully functioning crew at your back.  There are some other minor balance issues, but really, this game is well worth the £2.74 I paid, and I'd recommend it to everyone who wants a fun multiplayer experience at a discount price (if it's not on sale, wait until the next one).",

Somewhat similar to TF2, the egineer keeps things alive and kicking while being completely invaluable.

Or if it's just a really close game, a tie, match point for both teams, both of them charge, and suddenly: endscreen, and for a few seconds you don`t even know who won.

            "review_text": "Now I can't say I'm the most experienced player of Guns of Icarus Online. My highest level character is only rank 10 in engineer. But despite that I've played a good share of games and matches to say that it is an enjoyable and fun experience. Though not without some minor issues.   I enjoy the game-play for the most part. Unlike some other multiplayer platforms where it's direct contact with enemy players and teams, you focus more on destroying enemy ships or taking flags. I find this refreshing as sometimes dealing with other players directly gives way to frustration. For some people to the point of getting angry or calling 'HAX' and having the ensuing swears that follow. But here, you rarely see your enemy combatants. I've only seen enemy players in extreme cases where our ships were mere feet apart. But even then, both parties are mainly focused on repairing their ship or shooting the other one down. I like this because it keeps you on the larger task at hand. With ship v ship combat its less frustrating because you never have to deal with personal skill versus another but more group and crew comparability with another crew. A good crew can make or break your ship. Which is more cooperation I've had in a game in a long time.   The variety of ships are great, each having their own merits and design. Some ships I find great to fly in. While other's I steer clear of. But it's always nice to have a choice. Especially as there are now themes, decals, colors, and figureheads to customize your crews ship further. Some players/crews can really manage to bring out the strengths of certain ships. Especially if they work together in building it like me and my friends do. Another aspect of team work, that is outside of combat that I like.   Character customization is also fun. The designs are a Steampunk nature that I really enjoy as a fan of steampunk And outfits and colors are relatively cheap in the store. The most expensive item I think I've ever purchased was $5. And while it can be viewed as micro transactions its a good little way to support the devs and their game. Especially since you can still unlock some clothing and accessories through leveling.   That said I still think it would be nice for the developers to incorporate some kind of gifting system into the store. It'd would be nice to be able to give gifts to friends less fortunate or for birthdays and the like. I myself wanted to give the captain of the ship I play on a bi-corn hat. (proper wear for any leader) but it was difficult to do. I had to basically go to the devs themselves and ask. Which they were happy to do and I'm grateful they did.  Of course there is talk that the developers will try and incorporate a gifting system after they launch their DLC since most of their time and focus is set on that.   The population of the game is sadly not to high though. At most I think I've seen about 450 people on in one day. Which to me is tragic as the game really deserves a lot more love then it's getting. but, at the same time the people that do play it. Seem to stick with it. Still I feel it should get more then it's getting as of right now.  With that, I say Guns of Icarus Online is a fun game and worth looking into. It's good wholesome fun. Not frustrating to play, very exciting in tough and close call matches and great to build ships, crews and clans with.   9/10 - Not perfect but worth looking into if you enjoy airships and battles in the sky.

I understand the inconvenience of the hardpoints placements, but it such a hassle to move from one area to the next, getting caught on jaggednes or decorations on a ship. Several times I could have saved the ship's hull if I didn't get caught on a wall on my way to it. Good luck trying to get into games quickly, since the matchmaking is sort of a problem and the fact that there are so few people playing online. I am a fan of steam punk, however the dull, grungy pallete is a nitpick, so difficult to quickly make out what color a ship in the distance is, or your own ship for that matter. There are clear imbalances and preferences in ship classes online, which reduce much of the skirmishes to be just artillery pyrimidions or goldfish. the customization of the ship and person, is very limited, even the shop holds too little customization options and items.   Also, do yourself a favor when you first start off, is to go to video options and disable the crappy unnecessary filter and effects. Owners of lower end computers will thank me, since it kills frames like nothing. I don't even know why they bothered putting in that ♥♥♥♥ when it adds nothing.

I got it on sale, but it was worth far more than the four dollars I paid for it.   There are a few things that stand out as somewhat annoying, but the game overall is very well balanced.  Character customization is a bit lacking in the beginning, but eventually you rank up and get new stuff. So it evens out.  The tutorials are good, and explain what needs to be explained for beginners.  The Novice Queue is, to be entirely frank, EXACTLY WHAT MATCHED BASED TEAM GAMES NEED. Simply put, it limits the ships and weapons you will see until you either turn off the option or hit level eight in a class. You will experience the beginner ships, and a large portion of the weapons in the game. This allows you to get used to the general gameplay before diving into the advanced ships like the Spire or the Squid.   Oddly enough, for a game like this, the community is great. Most people are friendly and even joke around in the lobby or during down time in the match. The silly ship names help as well. There are the obvious ones that are annoying and down right disgusting, but I have encountered very few.  All in all, I would recommend this game to anyone who has the spare cash.

You can normally find it for dirt cheap anywhere. It regularly goes on sale between here and Humble Bundle for under $3. However, with the in-game cosmetic Microtransactions store, I would not recommend buying it for more than $5. That's just my personal take on MTs.  However, I will also say that, if you want to play this game solo, you NEED to be able to communicate and listen to direction. This is NOT a game you can lone wolf. Not even remotely. If you even try to, you may cost your team the victory. Within the three roles in the game, it's almost surprising that I've never really found anyone who complained about not being able to be a certain class. In the game, the preferable class layout per ship is a captain, gunner, and two engineers. I've never had any issue with players greifing about wanting to be captain or gunner if they're stuck on engineer. This game offers enough variety to make every role equally as essential and important.  If you want to play a great multiplayer game, I can't think of a better one.

This would be the case for TF2, but with Guns of Icarus it's more like, 'Woohoo! The gunner and I really destroyed that ship! And our engineer did a really great job, and our captain was an expert at telling us where to go and what to shoot, that was awesome!' I feel that because there are four people per ship, it really doesn't give you to many or to little people to interact with.

There is no set storyline aspect, but instead the game puts you and your crew into different situations every time! Plus, becuase it's multiplayer, me and my crew may react differently than each other in the same situation, making gameplay different, challenging and fun for all of us.   The Game Mechanics are also well done. It always keeps you on your feet and busy. Whether it's shooting, repairing, flying and even dying, there is always something happening that requires attention. It also helps socially as well. You can boss people around if you're the captain, or joke around with your fellow engineers while getting the ship back in motion, or even giving tips to noob gunners. The gameplay varies every time you play.  I also like the in-game AI. Although they are not the best crew, they are much smarter than the average AI! People are much better than AI of course, but when you're alone with no friends. They can come in handy. Of course you need to know the controls for them (F1, As you were. F2, Attack. F3, Repair) Don't worry, you can thank me later. But seriously, when used right, these guys can come in pretty handy.",

Check. - Actual cooperation, planning and coordination without which you're doomed? Check. - An assortment of ships, weapons and skills suiting the needs of any play style? Check.  If you are a steampunk fan - buy it. If you like cooperative play - buy it. If you just want to blow stuff up - ditto.

The core gameplay is simple: play with a human, AI, or mixed crew and pilot a steampunk themed airship and take on your enemies. There are 7 ships and 3 classes to choose from, so there's enough diversity in the game to keep you interested. Gamemodes are limited though; there is only 'team deathmatch' and king of the hill. Nonetheless, either game mode is fun (though most players prefer TDM) and you can play 2v2 to 4v4 matches. It is exponentially more fun to play with friends, but the community, though very small, still mostly cooperates and communicates in game. Additionally, the developers are very involved. Not many games feature events where the Dev team challenges players for prizes.  The game is full of fun waiting to be had, and at only 10 dollars it's hard not to find a reason to buy this game. Round up 3 friends and buy this game and go have a blast.  P.S. If you are new to the game, the best strategy is to pilot a squid with 3 gunners and set each weapon to mine launcher. Trust me, it works every time.",

You can play as the role of a pilot, Gunner, or Engineer on a 4-man flying vessel shooting down other vessels!. Each has an important role in keeping their ship from exploding! The pilot bravely guides their ships through O.K. sized maps, while the gunners shoot other people, while the engineer keeps them from exploding!

There are no individual stats displayed at the end of each round, although they are tracked so you can review them yourself, and do contribute to your character leveling up. Leveling your character confers no in-game bonus, but does serve as an indicator of how much experience you have playing the game. However, a team of veterans who do not pull together with their ship can easily be out-maneuvered and overpowered by a team of noobs who are actually working together, albeit even without a great understanding of how the game works. This is accomplished by built in voice support which automatically moves you to channels for the game lobby and your ship, once the action starts. The captains of the ships can also use a separate channel to plan strategy amongst themselves before handing out orders to their crew. That's what makes it such an interesting dynamic. The ships are competing, not the individuals. The crews are completing, not the individuals that make them up. It is also nice to play a game where the devs and mods play often and are available for questions. They've even added a couple new maps since I started playing a few weeks ago.",

I managed to fix it by just turning everything down. Communication with other ships is rough. Mainly because they don't feel like communicating. **You cannot jump off your ship and hijack another ship.** #The good: If you have a mic communication with your ship is smooth and actually really fun. It's steampunk pirates,and that's pretty awesome. Loads of customization. Flying game that, as long as you aren't pilot, requires no flying skill. TEAMWORK! ",

Matchmade with four crew per ship, one human captain is required per ship but bots will fill empty crew slots, allowing for one player per ship. Custimization boasts a variety of ships each offering a differnt play style, alongside class abilities and selectable deck guns. The combat is a mix of shooting the main weapons and maintaining the ship, with weapons manned by gunners and engineers running between engines and ballons. Each of the three classes has equipable gear and clothing, however leveling is removed to allow even fighting between any player, skill instead is what you gain in battle.   The health of the ship comes down to armour, covering the bear hull and auxillary systems needed to maintain flight. Each can be independantly targeted and destroyed, or set aflame, requiring any available crew to repair, all come with a basic repair, engineers specializing.   A great game  There is a rumored PvE in the works potentially containin a Co-op Campaign",

Long version:  It's kind of hard to find a place to start when talking about this game because there really is nothing else like it out there. Its like the best parts of some games combined with new ideas to make a new experience that for once is fresh and new. In a way it a is a class based, first person game with a third person option. Now when I say first person, and class based most would think TF2, and that isnt too bad of a frame of reference, except instead of mercs, each class has a different job on a flying steampunk battle ship. There is the gunner, whose main job is to man the ships gun turrets and fire at the other ships while loading up the guns with special ammo, the engineer who races around the ship keeping everything working while you are being fired at with various tools while buffing certain components, and the pilot whose job it is to control the ship and make sure the gunner can do their job properly. Each class is vital, but also not locked into their roles either, an engineer that doesnt need to make repairs can hop on a turret and fire or even take the helm if the pilot for whatever reason cant, a gunner can aid in repairs and naturally can repair their own guns, a pilot can let go of the helm and help out the engineers during a lull in the action. It's a game where teamwork and smarts take priority over mashing a button.   The game also has a cash shop in it, yes I heard the groans that coe when the word cash and shop are next to each other and can sense some worrying about it being pay to win, well guess what it isnt like that. The cash shop is purely for customization items for your character and ship. and if you dont want to pay for that kind of thing a lot can be obtained through ranking up via achievments. As for ships and weapons, guess what all are available to everyone from the get go, though novice players are limited since they are still learning the game.   It's unique, it has a lot of good ideas behind it, it has a welcoming community and most imortantly, it's fun! Go and get it already!",

I set a new heading and were off, were still out of range, the gunners tense up waiting for the right moment to fire. The engineers run around the ship buffing the weapons. Then all hell breaks loose, we exchange fire while a second hostile emerges from the clouds on our starboard side, peppering us with a devastating barrage. The prow guns are reloaded and we fire again, our baloon is hit, the port gun is damaged and the engine is on fire. I order the starboard guns to manned and I sweep by the enemy pouring red hot death into the their flank and quickly pull our ship up and around before we get blown to bits. The situatuon becomes desprate as we are pounded by combined fire from both hostiles. At the last second our ally swoops in and under combined fire we slay our first ship. The last enemy turns and fires on my ally ripping them to shreds and destroying them. My ship can hardly fly, the baloon is damaged, my guns are out, and the our hull is falling apart, I turn to my engineer and say 'this is gunna be a bumby ride'. I turn on the moonshine and rocket forward towards my last enemy. The crew is scrambling to maintain our crippled engines as the enemy launches a salvo at us. Moments from impact I switch to Impact Bumpers and slam into the foe, shattering them like a light bulb under a sledge hammer. A narrow victory, but a victory all the same!  tl;dr This game is EPIC!

I was given this game by a friend in the recent autumn sale, but I had seen it before and had some intrest in it, but not enough to want to buy it outright. However playing it with my friends was a very enjoyable experience and it constantly feels challenging. The exsistence of 3 class groups means each member of a crew is equally as needed, so nobody can outshine the rest of the team, meaning team work feels rewarding and substantial. Furthermore the skill of the online community is so that there is enough novice players to start out fighting against, but also a large number of skilled crews who create very difficult and exciting matches. Also, the number of ships and weapons available mean customisation to your team's strengths is viable.  A few problems though; the game is no-where nearly as fun if you dont play with friends, or with people with a microphone. Nothing is worse than sitting in a crew where no one is communication and everyone is doing their own thing. Also, some of the avatar customisation options and lore seem a bit pointless, as they are unused in the game itself, but that is only a minor flaw.  Overall, having played the game, I would buy this game at full price, but only if I had friends to play it with. The 4-pack is definately a good idea if youre looking to play regularly. Find some friends, and spend a good few hours getting you and your 'crew' up to speed, and you'll have a great time :)",

You belong to a four-man team which consists of a pilot/captain, gunners, and engineers. Each role can do the other roles if someone drops out of play, but each role receives a special bonus to their abilities. Captains gain special piloting skills, gunners do better at gunning, and engineers repair things that break or catch fire on the ship (as well as buff equipment temporarily). The ships in the game are all steampunk style, so think big hot air balloons with propellors and gears. Very cool. In addition, when the game is playing, you run around the ship. Some ships will have 7 guns, so if the captain tells you to run to port side, everyone scrambles to port side to fire cannons, gatling guns, sniper cannons, flamethrowers, or whatever other types of cool guns they've decided to place on their ships. If the ship catches fire, everyone has to start putting out fires. Your balloons can be deflated/destroyed and you must fix those or you just sink to the ground. Your propellors can get knocked out so you can adjust lift, but no forward or rear projection. Settings are varied, but often have canyons or skyscrapers or giant dust clouds, so tactical manuevering comes into play.  Simply put, this is an amazing game.

At the core of this game is the crew mentality. Since all classes can man a gun, repair a balloon or take helm (although each class is better at its given task), you are often switching around or collaborating efforts to keep your ship afloat. Every ship's crew has a captain who not only guides his crew but strategies with other captains. Crew members in turn help keep captains and their mates apprised of the situation with information such as damage reports, spotted enemy ships and triumphant cheers as the enemy bursts apart.

Some of the best times I've had were just chit chatting in the lobbies.  GET THE FOURPACK. WRECK STUFF WITH FRIENDS AND MEET NEW PEOPLE. BE THE CREW OF A BEASTLY STEAMPUNK WAR ZEPPELIN.",

In Counter Strike, there would be a noticeable delay when you get a kill, buy weapons, etc. This? I didn't even remember that I had 110 ping. That's impressive. 3: Nice matchmaking. This game matchmaking is great, maybe even better then CS's. Fast queue times(even though there is only 800 playing right now)and, you get to pick your preferred server. And if you get put into a different server, you won't notice because the netcode is so good. And CS's matchmaking also isn't that good because there are a ton of hackers. This game? None.

The community is genuinely really friendly and we could really use more players! :D  Great core gameplay and atmosphere that combine to make a simply great game! I love the steampunk feel and the design is really good. I love the soundtrack- it really fits the style of a great, adventurous, epic steampunk world- adding to the feel of the game; and also makes me think of Disney's Atlantis- which was kinda steampunk itself.  The different ships are really creative and add interesting tactics to every match- every ship has strenghts and weaknesses! And there is no one ship that is better- I'd say this game is VERY balanced and new players can pick it up pretty quickly. 3 roles: Gunner- just need to aim good and occasionally help the engineers repair. Engineer- repair stuff by whacking it!- a bit more stressful - especially in the middle of a blitzing fight. Pilot/ Captain- Much more skill required as you need to know strenghts of your ship and position well according to them.  Team work is essential but like I said- the community is really friendly!!! The maps are fun- I like the desert maps best.  Lots of features in the gameplay/ menu that add a lot more to the game, but are not that difficult to learn.   Awesome game! Simple, fun, and a great design, feel and community! I really recommend this game!",

The gunner gets more ammo types than any of the other classes, the engineer gets more repair and buff tools, and the pilot gets the most piloting skills (abilities they can activate while flying that have special effects, such as buffing the ship but damaging it or creating a giant smoke cloud). There are a fair variety of weapons for your ship like gattling guns, shotguns, sniping guns, medium-range flak cannons, and flamethrowers. Each has its advantages and disadvantages. Finding the right combo of gun and ammo type can be devastating to enemies.  All in all this game is pretty awesome, though it can be a bit unstable and crash sometimes (for me at least).",

It can be easily replaced with an engineer. -You can go AFK or leave the game straight up with no consequence. -The A.I. is not at all good.

( You can't use a weapon that's on fire) Why not try gold fish with carronade in front? Aim for the balloon and watch your opponent crash to the ground! Or maybe you are as mad as me and are in favor of pyramidion+ moonshine. Raise your speed by 300% and smash the hell out of your enemy! It does massive damage but moonshine also does huge damage to all your engines so a miss puts yourself into great danger!)  Neccessity of teamwork-A captain can often turn the tide around with his helm tools, but never with a bad crew! Engineer, fix the engines and put out those fires! Gunners, use your lesmok rounds at the opponents!  This game is just soooooo much fun. Just by how much i wrote you should get that point :P If you have any extra to spare, buy it.

            "review_text": "EDIT: The developers reverted the most severe changes within a few days of release. New review will be forthcoming as time permits.  =================================================================  This used to be a great game. Unfortunately, the last update has completely changed the core mechanics of the game in such a way as to make the game unplayable if you don't have at least 5 friends you consistently play with at any given time.  Matches are now decided purely by ally and crew skill level. While there used to be some margin for error in which a good pilot could recover from a bad situation and/or a relatively poor crew, there is now no margin at all. Ships routinely go down in two salvos from an enemy vessel with no hope of escape. Being ambushed is fatal 100% of the time.  The only way to have a nonzero chance of winning a round is to be willing to stack your side of the lobby with highly experienced players. This is why I mentioned at least 5 friends above; if you start a match with AI crew anywhere on your team you will get a new player or two join during the match and you will die. There is no player kick feature, so all it takes is one new player on your team and you need to start all over again in a new lobby, hoping again to get all high level players just to have a *chance* at actually winning. To add insult to injury, the playerbase is so small that each round of lobby stacking can take 30 minutes or more, just to have a new player join at the last minute and force a restart. This frequently leads to a.) playing anyway and predictably losing or b.) not playing at all. I have stopped playing GoIO over this; waiting 45 minutes in Lobbies of Icarus for a 5 minute match has zero appeal. Established competitive clans regularly use this major game flaw to pubstomp casual players.  The game fundamentally was designed around three distinct types of player, Captain, Engineer, and Gunner, each with its own unlockable cosmetic items and achievements. These items, if not unlocked, are for sale for real world currency in Muse's online store. The recent update has made it so that no one will fly with Gunner class players on their ships. On the surface, this looks like a greedy move from the game developers to effectively lock 1/3 of the unlockable items and force people to spend money on them instead.  Maps and gametypes are stale, gameplay becomes more mundane and boring with each patch from the developers (around 6 - 12 months between patches). Focus seems to be on the 'Lobbies of Icaus' metagame, with matches frequently decided in the lobby before the skirmish even starts. Game also appears to be going through some kind of identity crisis with the introduction of fixed-wing WWII-style airplanes in Adventure mode (remember this was supposed to be a steampunk alternate world with airships, but now we also have airplanes?!).  While I heartily enjoyed the old game, this new one is a complete waste of time. Don't waste your money on it too!",

Quick recap: this great-looking and great-sounding game is about piloting, gunning and repairing dieselpunk airships dukeing it out in a post-apocalyptic, war-thorn land, using crazy-♥♥♥♥♥ weaponry. It is high-adrenaline, and very-much team-based rather than true PvP: It is also fair; beginners like veterans have the very same skills and choices.  It is NOT a dogfighting airgame, and it is NOT a FPS: It is closer to a moving Tower Defense kind of game. It may seem ponderous at the beginning, but once the ennemy is sighted it gets intense real fast, and in these times, crew cohesion and fleet tactics will make the difference. A mike is strongly suggested.  The biggest beef I had with the game was its exclusive PvP nature - and it latest matchmaking habits. But since Alliance got released, it's a whole new game as player fleets face waves of PvE challenges, with new airships and more. There is a world, or franchise building itself up around these fantastic machines, and Alliance is the first step towards it. I definitely want more of it. How many steampunk games are there on Steam?  Just buy the game, even if you are not a ship/dieselpunk/fighting games adept: it is cheap (the online store only sells cosmetic add-ons that have no impact on one's performence), the community is gentlemanly and the developpers keep an ear to the ground with feedback, events and gifts.  Best gaming value on Steam, IMHO. And it's an Indie.",

You can enjoy the slow build of anticipation as you hunt your as-yet unrevealed foe, mixed with the awe-inspiring serenity of the landscapes that you pass under, over and between on your way. You can feel the unrivaled sense of superiority and swashbuckling derring-do as you fly your airship head-on into your enemy, guns blazing, orders cutting through the air with all the vim and urgency of the most confident of crack military commanders. You can experience those moments when your captain lines you up the sweetest shot with the flamethrower you've ever had, and you feel neither remorse, nor pity for the crew opposite, but a real glee as you cook their ship around them like a Tennasee barbecue. You can feel a sense of accomplishment when you suddenly realize how well you and your fellow teammates are behaving, strategically, and how well it's working, and how that match seems so laughably easy that you cannot help but grin. And then there is the full, complete joy of rattling through a pitched battle of heavy fighting, where both you and your opponent are so thouroughly even and so nearly licked, but you pull out the one maneuver they weren't expecting, and come out on top. With everyone breathing a glad sigh of relief for just one mutual moment of perfect happiness before turning towards the wreckage of the ship and getting it back in order.

The flaw in the game is simply that the ai is burdensome at best, often, and that the number of players at a given time is sadly fairly low.
