            "review_text": "The art style and soundtrack are cool, and the gameplay is pretty good, but it's too impractical to be a paid game. It seems more like something you'd play on kongregate when you got a couple of hours to kill. Figuring out a level takes about 1 minute, and then it's just hoping you don't screw up the platforming (And if you're playing on nigtmare or going for all brains, Morgan Freeman bless you.) The levels go one at a time, so if you're stuck, you can't do anything, unlike games like Super Meat Boy where if you're stuck, you at least have another level to play.   Overall, the concept is cool, the art and soundtrack were pretty good, but the gameplay was executed poorly.  5/10",

            "review_text": "All the idiots who compared this to Super Meat Boy should be vivisected with a fondue fork and it is shameful of the devs to quote not one but two reviews who use this comparison which makes no sense whatsoever.  The game has ONE thing going for it, the artstyle is nice and it looks good overall, but past that, it's a tedious platformer without the most basic element of a platformer: Control. The zombies move automatically which leaves you with 2 decisions: which direction to start running and when to jump, which makes for a fairly unpleasant experience.  All in all, not worth my time and energy.",
