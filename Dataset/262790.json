In this game, however, you will die and fail time and time again, and you still eagerly try to beat it again, since you are able to keep a little something from each attempt, witch you can use to have edge in the next attempts to come. You learn by trying and dying. Setting is also nice, you will never see the same levels no matter how many times you re-try, boss batttles are fun, not to mention decent amount of weird items with even weirder descriptions, that will give you a fair insight into game lore.  This game is 300mb of awesomeness.",

            "review_text": "Appealing art style, fantastic soundtrack, and overall an atmosphere I find much more interesting than Binding of Issac, which is the first thing all people compare it to.  Some quick things to note:  You only have 4-directional shooting. If you're shooting while strafing, the shot will fire at an angle, also requiring precise movement while shooting. Hitboxes are odd, but you get used to them after a while. Your character isn't very mobile unless you utilize the dodge mechanic, so remember to use it in combat. It's very expensive for what it is. It's on Humble Bundle right now, so I'd recommend getting it there. Where the balls is the soundtrack!? Got the Touhou flowing through my veins a few times.  Ultimately, though, this review is coming from someone who has never played Risk of Rain, Binding of Issac, or any other games people compare it to. But this is because it's the first that I looked at that just from the screenshots and description, it grabbed a lot more of my attention. I'll check out Binding of Issac when the rerelease comes out.",

            "review_text": "Think of it as a less random Binding of Isaac, with more persistent unlocks that affect how you play.  It doesn't look pretty all the time, but Our Darker Purpose has it where it counts. It's got a bit of awkward style, but where it really shines is in how it plays. Enemies interact in interesting ways with the environment. It has two separate tracks of progression, items and levels, as opposed to Isaac's items, which means fewer runs where you end up daunted by the random item generator. The persistent unlocks, meanwhile, let you emphasize specific builds, making a lot of choices pretty tactical.  And you can roll! Rolling makes this game. Isaac tends to overwhelm you with bullets as it ups the difficulty; Our Darker Purpose throws very angry, charging enemies at you, and expects you to be able to dance around them. Which, with the roll, you definitely can.  The writing's pretty cute, too. The level up books are a nice touch, as are the series of in-universe middle grade excerpts that come as lore.   It's not a classic of videogaming, but it's charming and challenging and strangely compulsive.",

            "review_text": " Story:  Little story about a girl name Cordy adventuring through the building. Nothing special, but a lot of additional, unlockable pieces of lore through following archivists and beating bosses.   Gameplay:  Very much like Binding of Isaac. Rectangular rooms with doorways in any of the cardinal directions, enemies, and random (annoying) pieces of debris/furniture scattered about. Different types of rooms include: Challenge rooms, vending machines, bosses, and the normal 'can't progress until you beat all the enemies' room. WASD to move, arrows to shoot, space to roll. Randomized items dropped by champion (red) enemies, in chests, and from vending machines. Each run will probably be different. Medium sized roster of bosses and enemies. Also, selectable paths with different traits, and passive upgrades that you can unlock by completing certain achievements. Overall, challenging, smooth controls, and a lot of replayability. The biggest issue that I have is that some of the hitboxes are a bit odd.   Art/Soundtrack  Dank and dark. Just kidding, partially. The atmosphere is gothic and sticks to cooler/darker hues. The soundtrack just adds to this feeling. Solemn menu music, (slightly) haunting/eerie music while exploring the floors, and 'mystical' boss music. I can't think of a better way to describe it XD.   TL:DR/Overall  If you like Binding of Isaac or challenging games with a fitting atmosphere, loads of replayability, and plenty of lore, buy this game. It's well worth the price.",

            "review_text": "Our Darker Purpose is a fantastic game, but due to Binding of Isaac being around, comparisons are inevitable. Of course we have the top-down perspective, shooting projectiles at enemies while running through rooms and picking up items. Heck, even the stragely sized rooms of ODP have been matched now that Rebirth is out. However, that is where comparisons for me end. Where as Isaac is focused on action and unsubtle humor, ODP is more about atmosphere, mystery, and discovery, with a sprinkle of humor mixed in for the dedicated or patient. How many games have idle conversations between pieces of furniture or sacks of potatoes?  Its atmosphere is where it stands out the most in comparison. It is far darker (both in tone and in actual lighting) and there is far more to learn as the game progresses. Defeating bosses, finding secret rooms, and collecting certain items gives you insite into how the orphanage work and what dark secrets it was hiding, even before the events of the game. I felt like the lore of ODP is much deeper than Isaac, because where Isaac is more about interpretation, ODP is more about discovery. The gameplay is the most similar between the two, but it has enough that sets it appart. There is dodge-rolling, recovery items (juice boxes) that you can hold for when you need them, a level up system, and a health bar with a value instead of hearts. Another huge difference is that in ODP, there is a special ability board of sorts in which you can unlock abilities, spend the points you get on each run to get use of them, and use a certain number of them to help improve your chances in various ways. And yes, improve your chances. This game is far more difficult than Isaac. There are very few, if any, overpowered items, although a number of them do synergize nicely. You have to work with what you have and hopefully use those preselected abilities to your advantage. Overall, I really enjoy Our Darker Purpose. While I do find Isaac more fun due to its wacky combinations and god-like status by the end of a run, Our Darker Purpose feels more satisfying. Going up the floors feels like far more of an accomplishment, beating a boss without taking damage or by beating it in its own special way is more fun, and the difficulty spikes so hard that if you aren't prepared you will die, no questions asked.

            "review_text": "This game... It's actually pretty hard to recommend it, although I really want to do it. It has nice visuals, great art style and pleasant music. It has a certain Burton-esque feel because of that, which I like, I won't lie.  In gameplay terms 'Our Darker Purpose' looks like a follow-up to 'The Binding of Isaac', there's no doubt about that. And to a degree it does some things even better that 'Isaac' - personally, I like the fact that rooms are different in size almost every time, instead of 3x3 blocks in 'Isaac'. It gives variation. With that, and with addition of a level up mechanic and the ability to roll and dodge, it makes this game to stand out next to 'TBoI'. But... There are problems. And they are pretty bad. First of all, level up benefits and bonuses from items. They are practically non-existent. The only time I actually saw a slight change in combat performance was with rate of fire, and that was only because I've leveled this stat with basically every level up and item that have dropped from mini-bosses. And again - this was almost a non-existent change. As for the other stats... Well, there was no feel of change at all - not with range of fire, not with movement speed, not with anything. The movement speed is one of the biggest problems. You move with the speed and grace of a snail, no matter how many level ups you dump into a movement speed upgrades. Developers added the roll as a way to move faster, sure, but it doesn't make it better. It feels more like a cheap way to justify the roll mechanic. There is another problem - hit detection. I have a feeling that the hit box of your character is actually bigger than the characther herself. Because of that it's hard to say when you would take damage and when not. Not to mention an always present chance of stucking in an environmental object while walking or rolling at the most crucial moment because of those odd hit boxes. But it's worse with enemies. Some times your projectiles just fly through them, doing nothing. Granted, that's more likely to happen with enemies bigger then Cordy. For instance, the only way to actually hit that tall-as-a-mountain girl who throws chairs at you is (when you are not above or under her) is to shoot in her legs/belly. Why? She is twice as big as Cordy! Why I can't shoot her in a head, for god sake? With all that, the game is supposed to be that 'fiendishly hard platformer/action', I guess. Basically a game genre on it's own these days. Yes, it is hard. But not in a good way, unfortunatly. Take, for instance, 'They bleed pixels'. It is a great 'fiendisly hard platformer'. Why? Because it's hard but fair. Unfortunatly I can't say the same about 'Our Darker Purpose'. Here all this difficulty comes mostly from one source - the game throws tons of projectiles and enemies at you at the same time. Combine that with odd hit detection, slow movement speed, basically non-existent stat changes, and you get your 'fiendish' difficulty. And what's more depressing is that it feels cheap. 'You want your game to be very difficult? Make your character slow, make his damage output weak and throw tons of stuff at him! Have fun!'. Overall, would I recommend this game at all, considering its problems?.. Suprisingly, yes. Under all these problems lies a good game. It's just that right now 'Our Darker Purpose' feels unpolished, almost unfinished in terms of game mechanics. Would I recommend you to buy it? Yes. Maybe not for a full price, but yes. Support 'Avidly Wild Games', show them that this game has potential on the market, that gamers are interrested in it. So that they would look at all these problems and fix them. Because this game deserve this.",

The mechanics are amazing, and give the game its own, distinct feel. In particular, the class and level up system are amazing methods of tackling character customisation. The graphics and music are a delight to behold, and assist in the immersion of the game. The game is challenging, and I would say more so than The Binding Of Isaac. However, it has kept me coming back for more attempts despite this. Having just cleared the final chapter, I am currently hunting a couple more achievements before moving on to hardmode (another wonderful addition which in a sense makes the game 1.5 times longer.) The lore is another difference from The Binding Of Isaac. It gives an additional layer of mystery and story to this already wonderful game, and it will make you curious about what exactly the game is about. Definitely give it a try!",

The 2GB ram requirement is a LIE because the game runs 2/3 instances at a time, it can easily eat up 3 - 4 (as far as I can physically tell) gigs of ram for absolutely no reason other then the developer chose not to leak memory and after constant play (unless you have a few spare gigs of ram floating about, which most do up to 8) it will start skipping freezing up until crash. The game also constantly writes to a sql server running concurrently to store data for *every* stat (no literally everything, constantly) in the game, rather then your own computer.   I play on a junk system sure (I only have 2gigs of ram), the requirements fit up for me, so I should of had no problem enjoying this. But I've had a HORRIBLE time trying to enjoy this due to poor development (engine?/Scripting? wise) and I'm shocked that steam allows such poorly designed indie games in their store.

            "review_text": "In my very recently developed passion for roguelike games, I stumbled upon Our Darker Purpose on the Steam frontpage. Initially I was going to discard it as another indie game that sold entirely on the premise of its pretty art, but seeing as it was a roguelike, I decided to try out my new payment method by buying it.  Well, those ten dollars could have been better spent.  True to its roguelike nature, the game thrusts you upon the ruins of a school that changes every time you play the game. The thing is, you'll find yourself doing that way more than it'd be fun to.  Don't assume I'm giving this game a bad review because of the difficulty.  No, it's because of the unfairness. There is practically nothing for your character (a distressed, half-goth-half-moeblob shy little girl named lovingly named Cordy) to do once an enemy has set their sights on you. What I imagine must have initially been designed as an evasive roll is instead little more than a glorified burst of speed where you can still be hit by the enemy. The rest of your abilities are terribly uneffective attacks -or at least, I assume they're attacks, by what little information I managed to absorb from a 'tutorial' consisting of a few scribbles on the first room of each new game. It's nigh-impossible to dodge enemy attacks, and skill has naught to do with it.  The entire game's design either lacks foresight or is simply lazy. The majority of characters have a terrible lack of animations; Cordy herself only has an animation for her roll, and an animation for her walk. Getting hit by an enemy elicits little more than a 'blink' from your sprite, reminscent of those from a past-decade arcade beat 'em up. Even the menus are strange, allowing you the use of your mouse in one menu, and taking it away from you in the next one. Like I said, the game offers you little-to-none information on just what the ♥♥♥♥ you're supposed to do, and it wasn't until my third death that I took it upon myself to navigate the jumbled menus to see if there was anything as my reward for future progress. True enough, there was a 'Counselor' in one of the menus to whom I could pay the 'favors' I earnt at the end of each level in exchange for tips.  Like I said, the game didn't tell me any of this. I could have potentially gone an entire playthrough without even realizing there was a friendly NPC in the main menu. There may even be more helpful stuff out there for me to find. Perhaps if I type in the Konami code I'll get a lightsaber? If I don't experiment I'll never know.  Those are the two main downfalls of this game. The lack of information, and the tediousness of the design. Oh, and the unfairness; did I mention you're screwed for the whole game?  Now, the game has just come out, so it may be unfair for me to write a review this early. But you're supposed to release a game when it's at least completed enough to be /fun/, not as a half-baked cake with an IOU.   If you're looking for a game with similar art, get Don't Starve. If you're looking for a roguelike, get Rogue Legacy or Spelunky. At least at the moment I am writing this review, this game is not worth touching.",

Outside of the items that buff your character to various degrees, you also get level ups which allow you to choose between two potential boosts in a variety of stas--speed, attack power, health, etc. Further, completing floors gets you credits, which can be used to buy 'classes' which serve to alter the base abilities that Cordy starts with, either by giving her more items, more selection at vending machines, exchanging the roll for a teleport, or other minor-to-game-changing options. The art style is Edward Gorey-esque (basically the guy who Tim Burton wants to be), the soundtrack effectively atmospheric, and the story is peppered with subtle 'ah ha!' moments for those who take the time to dive into the lore. It's also a charmingly (though darkly) funny game, with witty descriptions and dialogue detailing the slow unravelling of Edgewood's secrets. The bosses are the game's biggest strength, in my opinion--creative and fun to fight, each big bad needs to be approached in a way that is different from everything else. Nothing seems to be a simple reskin of an earlier foe with extra health, which is greatly appreciated. There are some downsides, the biggest of which is the fact that hard mode is a bit too geared against the player in that if you don't have 2-3 damage boosting levels/items by the first chapter boss, later bosses are going to be nightmarish slogs of whittling down massive health bars protected by obscene defense stats. While I appreciate difficult games, patience isn't really the thing to be testing. It also makes me dread fights I was looking forward to--to reiterate, the boss battles really are some of the game's strongest moments. But, really, my misgivings are just on the optional hard mode. And it could be that I'm just awful, so what do I know? If you like this kind of game, check it out.",

This game is really fun. Tough as nails, but fun. The enemies and bosses are lovingly designed. It has a charming art style. What little music there is is haunting and well put together. It still sees periodic updates that are carefully balanced and improve the overall experience.  The most glaring problem with this game is that Cordy has no firing animation aside from some swirly fire that moves independent of her. That will never stop bugging me even though I'm not looking at Cordy most of the time when playing this game. The hitboxes are also strange and not entirely obvious upon looking at the sprites.  That said, the items and upgrades you get can change your gameplay in important ways, but it seems as if there are a specific few upgrades or items that you absolutely need in order to beat the game. At least a few of the items from that group, anyway. But overall the pacing and balance of the game is pretty good, especially after unlocking better lessons (permanent upgrades in-game).  Is it worth 15 bucks? It's getting there, yeah. Every update refines the experience. If I were writing this review for past-me, I would tell myself to get it for 15 dollars. But this game certainly isn't for everyone.",

Of course u can see this as a bad thing aswell  Cons: - Gameplay feels not as flawless like the Binding of Isaac's - Not often but Sometimes there are unfair Rooms/Situations where there doesnt seem to be a way to avoid dmg - Somtimes slowpaced because Champions/Bosses have a lot of HP, specially if u get unlucky with dmg upgrades - Progression-System (i see it as a good and a bad thing in a roguelike, because u cant beat the game at low progression, well if u not godlike at least...) - (minor Point) theres no Gamepad Support (fixable with Joy2Key or similar programs)  Conclusion: Nice roguelite Game with some Problems but still pretty solid. If you want something like the Binding of Isaac and can forgive some Flaws u should consider getting Our Darker Purpose.",

While it has obviously drawn inspiration from several more popular games, especially Binding of Isaac which I have sunk far too much time into, Our Darker Purpose is its own thing entirely. Bullet hell dual stick shooters are fun in general to me. Our Darker Purpose has an interesting story that is, for some reason, related to King Lear and manages to be integrated to the game without being invasive to gameplay. There's also a clever sense of humor that shows up in item descriptions, backstory, and the talking potatoes. Basically I like it any anyone who likes bullet hell dual stick shooters will probably like it too.",

            "review_text": "I think thirteen hours in and an agonizing defeat near the top is enough time to give this game a fair review.  Our Darker Purpose is an insanely hard Rogue-lite with many similar elements to Binding of Isaac only with a sort of Tim Burton / A Series of Unfortunate Events twist which really allows it to shine on its own merits. To quickly go into the simularities this game has to Binding of Isaac, there are several different floors with increasing difficulty and theming, interesting bosses, an open-to-interpretation plot, tons of unlockables that you grab over the course of several games, and steady length increasing (every time you complete a run, you unlock a newer harder area which becomes the new end of the next run).   What Our Darker Purpose does differently is that it escalates... well, just about everything. But the most important aspects are the bullet hell style evasion, more RPG leveling and stats, and how very quickly the game can bite you in the ♥♥♥ no matter how hard you try. To say that it's unforgiving is putting it mildly, if you're willing to put up with failure after constant failure, learning and adapting to the game, then this is a great fun game with a steady incline in difficulty. To be honest calling it a Rogue-LITE feels inappropriate as almost everything in this game is dependant upon what items you get with a constantly changing metagame. You can have an amazing early game, grab lots of amazing items, and then get your ♥♥♥ handed five times to sunday because you're not getting any more tokens or Juice Box spawns. Not that it matters considering that enemies deal steadily increased damage as time goes on. I had two hundred health by the top floor and hard hitting, fast shooting enemies were dealing about thirty damage. I died in that room in agony.  I love Binding of Isaac and found Rebirth to be almost a little too easy for my tastes, so Our Darker Purpose was a great amount of difficulty I thrived for. But, I've also found that Our Darker Purpose's greatest strengths were also its greatest weaknesses. For starters the game constantly gets harder, which is awesome as before long I was beating Chapter one without a sweat. Because the game is exponentally harder as you progress, you can never really have much time to practice those floors. bosses, enemies, and learn their patterns. And when you die, it'll take a good hour or so just to make it back to that place again, and who knows what items you'll get - if any - when you get back there. There's great variety in items and leveling perks (you can choose between two random ones every level) that work together very well. But you only get items from enemy Leaders, chests, and vending machines, not bosses, which means that if the first two decide not to appear and there aren't enough tokens around the map, then you're without items. Leveling also quickly dips off as enemies give more XP, but not enough to give you additional levels. Plus there's no way to grind levels as once you finish a floor you're onto the next. Also the books are randomized, so you could never get the book perks that you need to really make a run beautiful. By itself the darkly comedic (and straight up horrific) lore is wonderful, and manages to shine without any real falterings. So good for it.  So - again - Our Darker Purpose takes the Isaac formula and runs with it, to mixed results. As the game continues to get balancing and general gameplay patches, I can expect some of my complaints to change or at least be diminished in time. Eventually it may become the go-to game for a more demanding Rogue-lite bullet hell game. It has the atmosphere, it just needs that polish. Personally I hope for an easy mode or some sort of continue option so I can at least learn how painful the upper floors will be without having that cloud of 'if I lose I'm going to have to start all over again' hanging over my head. I think it'll also make the game a bit more accessible as it's already really amazing for more dedicated players (there's a hard mode! A ♥♥♥♥ing hard mode!).  Highly recommended if you like Binding of Isaac, or at least its formula, and want something much harder. Recommended if you want to see what the hype is about and are willing to put a lot of time into learning how to play the game through constant failure. Not recommended if you get frustrated easily, or just are on the edge about games like this. This game will not change your mind, if anything it'll make you feel like the hundreds of poor hilariously abused orphans in this game.",
