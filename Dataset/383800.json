While there are some balancing issues and other small glitches it’s what you would expect from an 'early access' game. Overall the gameplay is entertaining in short play sessions but lacks incentive to keep playing.",

            "review_text": "Lots of bugs. For example, when I started a new game there were no graphics, only a few words. I tried all sorted of graphical combinations and no luck. I then continued a game and it worked. Another bug is that some ships in the formation weren't there, but I couldn't replace them or remove them or anything. Oh, and I couldn't get back to the crossroads (essentially the menu) at the end of a mission.  It doesn't support anything above 1600 res, and you can't change the music and sound independently.  I wanted to like this as it's a pretty decent idea, but I can't recommend it.",

            "review_text": "Close Order… What can I say, this game was very eventful, and I don’t mean to put that in a good way. Eventful as in the game constantly crashes and was literally impossible to beat. Now I have a lot of faith in these developers simply based on my judgements of the main menu and the music, but I personally do not think this game is currently in a playable state. It still needs a lot of work. My opinion on this game is based on the game’s current state and I still look forward to seeing how it turns out in the future. First off, I need to give this game some credit for its main menu. I really liked the music in the background and the fact that you had to actually fly your aircraft to the game mode you wanted to play. Being a musician and slowly getting into sound design and composing music for video games, I must give credit to the music composer because he did a great job. Also the fact that you were able to free roam really helped make the game more enticing to play by holding my attention and making the start of the game less boring. Now although the main menu looked and ran very well, the following is where my experience goes completely downhill. There was nothing but crashes all the way through even after resetting my computer and changing the settings multiple times. After the game crashing three times every time I landed in Story Hub 1, I was finally able to click on a mission. Although this got me excited, I was not able to start the mission, I was only able to watch a brief video. Although I was able to watch the video over and over again, I was unable to click on anything else or exit the mission itself. Out of frustration, I started pushing all the buttons on my keyboard until the pause menu came up, which sadly had caused the game to crash again. Now, this is usually when I would give up and not even attempt to try to play the game again, but like I said above, the menu itself and the music were so enticing I had to try again. This game looks like it has potential and I didn’t want to miss out on anything. I started the game again, but instead of going to Story Hub 1, I flew over to Survival mode, only to have the game crash again the moment I landed in the circle that brings you to the list of levels… I tried Story Hub 1’s mission, all of the survival modes, only to have the game crash every single time, not allowing me to even experience actual game-play. This is not something you want your game to have a reputation of doing. After finally realizing I had to click about two inches above what I wanted to actually select, I was finally able to start the first mission in Story Hub 1. This is not an issue with my PC as I have never experienced it before. Everything was fine once the game actually started though, which means that it must just be a simple coding issue that can very easily be fixed. Man oh man, was that first mission ever difficult. I could even destroy the first tier of enemies! After dying about a dozen times, I gave up with the only mission in Story Hub 1 that I was able to play, and headed back over to survival mode. This game is beyond difficult even when you have minions protecting you! Even in survival mode I wasn’t able to destroy all the ships attacking me after many attempts. It’s so difficult to see the bullets being shot from the enemies, and there’s so many of them that there’s no way to dodge any of them. With little to no progression in the game after around an hour of playing (not including all the time spent actually getting in-game), I decided to stop it there and simply just hope that the game will get fixed in the near future. This is not my type of game, so maybe I simply am just terrible at it, but I truly do not think that’s the case. This game is not challenging, it’s literally impossible to play. Although the main menu was very intriguing, the constant crashing and the game-play itself made this game completely unappealing to me. I am going to give this game a rating of 2/10. I really hope this game gets fixed. I am looking forward to checking it out again once I come back to it in a month or so! ",
