            "review_text": "At the time of this writing (January 2016), this 'game' is a pretty good (yet limited) VJ visualizer tool. It has nice video backgrounds that synchronize to whatever audio is coming out of your speakers, and you can add some effects and filters like bloom, motion blur and color filters to them.  The playable part of this title only serves as a mean to unlock new videos, effects and filters for your visualizer. Once you finish unlocking them all, there is no reason to go back and play.  If you want a pretty VJ visualizer for your party, this might be it! Specially at this low price.  Note to the author: please use your knowledge to create a 'VJ Visualizer Creator' that allows the users to import their own short video loops. You could also sell some 'video banks' and effects as DLC. Think about it! ;)",
