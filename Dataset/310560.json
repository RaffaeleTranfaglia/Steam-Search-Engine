    "description": "DiRT Rally is the most authentic and thrilling rally game ever made, road-tested over 80 million miles by the DiRT community. It perfectly captures that white knuckle feeling of racing on the edge as you hurtle along dangerous roads, knowing that one crash could irreparably harm your stage time.",

How many times did I restart stages and tried again and again...and again...no other game managed it before to keep me pushing forward like DiRT Rally did...a masterpiece in my opinion...I sure can't keep up with the top players but I'm playing this game because it's just pure joy to race in DiRT Rally!  Let me quote the EVO mag here which fits perfectly my opinion of the game in general:  'Dirt Rally is difficult, immersive, beautiful, challenging, entertaining, frustrating, shocking and a whole lot of fun if you’re prepared to put the time into mastering it. Since that perfectly describes real rallying too, we feel safe in describing Dirt Rally as the best rallying videogame yet.'  nothing else to say than.....thank you Codemasters for this wonderful game...I wish I'd have more time to practice and play it &lt;3",

The way these professional rally drivers took corners effortlessly, flew over jumps as if they actually had wings and how the miraculously came out of ever spectacular tumble un-harmed. So being the naive little boy i was i went out and bought DiRT 1, and it was the best game i ever owned, and soon after that DiRT 2 came along and blew me away with its imersive campaign mode and vast amount of cars. When i grew older and entered my teens I was looking for a more challenging game than DiRT 1 or 2; as i have mastered them completely. I remember the day i bought Dirt 3, another adventure in a box just waiting for my teenage hands to learn the mystery of GYMKHANA. So you could imagine my excitement stumbling upon a page witin the DiRT Reddit annoucing the new game 'DiRT Rally'. I had the amazing chance to help the DiRT community to create the new version of my favorite game , a real dream come true. Long story short DiRT Rally won't be just a game to me, it's an experience which i helped to create. I had high expectations for this game, and all those expectations were met, and more 10/10",

IF SO THAN WHAT ON ODIN'S BEARD ARE YOU BLOODY WAITING FOR!?!?!?!  This game is exceptional... it really is... I was a huge fan of Dirt 3 but I was dissapointed in the small stages in Dirt 3... but guess what... LONG and SHORT stages as well as Pikes Peak's famous hillclimb tournaments...   The classes range from 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, kit cars, 1990s 2000's and modern as well as the infamous WRX v EVOs...   Numerous countries such as Germany, Finland, Sweden, Greece, Wales and more...   Numerous tournaments including online tournaments, you can create your own tournaments and put them online, leaderboards, daily, weekly and monthly challenges to earn more ingame $$$ (which you use to purchase cars, otherwise you must rent them),   NO PAY TO WIN WHATSOEVER... completely in-game currency from completing tournaments....   Realistic driving simulation and damage... be prepared, you can puncture your tyres in which it costs you +1:30 on your finish time, you can damage your radiator, you can even stack so hard that you forfeit the race and if your vehicle is beyond repair, costs you the WHOLE championship XD...   Co-driver is fantastic... you can even speed up or slow down his instructions to your liking...   The replays are nothing short of spectacular... even has some awesome drone camera angles from the air...   the camera/view features 2x 3rd person, bonnet, inside windscreen, an awesome cockpit view and my all time favourite, that bumper view where you see no part of the vehicle whatsoever (I use this when in serious mode, as I drive the best in this view which I'm spewing coz I love seeing the car... Even when you create your own tournament, you can restrict the view to cockpit only!  This game is also open to steam workshop where you can upload your vehicle setups for whichever car, for other people to download... which comes in handy if you're anything like me and not interested into the nitty gritty of the art of mechanics and aerodynamics... I JUST WANNA RACE!!!!  I have my game set to high with shadows and other non-essential extras set to medium and it looks absolutely gorgeous with excellent frames running off a GTX 680M (laptop)... the sound is brilliant really immersive... don't even think about TEAMSPEAK while playing this, even with ALL the audio set to it's lowest, you still won't hear your friends over the roaring and screaming of your engine...   I cannot fault this game at all... and I'm being completely honest this game really impressed me, CODEMASTERS really put every ounce of love they had into this game, I feel sorry for their spouses...  HOWEVER if I were to really try and look for a fault in this game, I'd say that there are idiots who cheat their way to the top of the leaderboards as I discovered that someone with only 24 hours experience defeated a person with 450 hours experience using the same car by almost a whole minute... and we all know in racing, 1 second is a lot of time! upon inspecting this guys profile, I noticed he has a current ban for cheating (surprise surprise) so I just reported him anyway...  Another thing I thought of... it doesn't have an Australian Rally, remember in Colin McRae those awesome as Aussie tracks with the train lines through the bush... well no Aussie tracks :'(   Last but not least.... this game has held it's price tag, it goes on special quite often but not enough for people who aren't willing to give this game a go...  My verdict....  10/10 it really is a modern gem, and one that comes out completed and without the over priced abuse of marketing technique for dlc  This game in my opinion is actually worth $60USDit has really impressed me, and i'm not evcen a car freak or one of those gamers with ONLY racing games... This is the ONLY racing game that I can spend more than an hour playing!  THANKYOU CODEMASTERS.... THANKYOU :')",

I feel the speed, every inch of the car and the track. I sometimes smile as a child after a great run or when I am in the air with my Sierra Cosworth. And sometimes I yell and scream when I feel I'll end up in the forest. Actually, once I yelled that '♥♥♥♥ you finns, I beat you in Finland!' at the end of a stage. :-D   Yes, the game is hard but satisfying after every well-executed turn or stage.  I'm in my thirties, I played tons of circuit and rally racing games and simulations. All I can say, Dirt Rally is the top of it. No, really!

You can easily play with keyboard or controller (which I prefer despite having a wheel), but wheel support and FFB is very good here. This has everything you might want in a rally game and if you like this kind of motorsport, this is a must have.  There is only a few little things that could be better and that would make this game perfect in every way: - you cannot select your tires, they always are the right ones for the conditions - a rally school would be a very nice feature, especially that the game is quite challenging - the AI difficulty is a bit over the top - I may not be the fastest driver, but I consider myself pretty descent and I have not won a single stage or rally on any difficulty (rallycross is quite easy though)",

            "review_text": "This and Toybox Turbos are both examples of what Codemasters can do when they rein in the budgets and give their titles focus. Both titles benefit, and we finally get to see another fully realistic rally game as a result. The controls have no weird kinks, there's no overlong segues between menus, it's just pick how long you wanna race for, pick the car you wanna race in and a loading screen later you're on a track.  You might be scared into thinking that a fully realistic rally game would demand a several-thousand-dollar Fanatec setup, but I've been playing this game on a cheap Ikea desk with a Logitech gamepad for half a year and I can get top-100 times using just that. It takes practise, sure, but no more than on that complex sim setup.  This game is now out of Early Access, and there's two main gameplay modes: Time trials on special stages, as in classic rally tradition; and Rally Cross, that being a six-car race on a short track with a mix of on-road and off-road sections. There's no tutorial, this game relies entirely on its progression mechanics as a way to teach you. You get just enough money to buy a slow 1960s car and you get pitted against other equally slow 1960s cars. The game also makes it explicit that you have no chance to win your first few championships by having you earn upgrades every time you use your car, its way of saying that it's okay to take it slow and just learn how to handle the machine you're in. Those first stages become oddly relaxing, and an exercise in just learning the track and the car.  There's other similarly relaxing mechanics in place. You start with a mechanics team who can't properly mend your car after a stage, and you won't be able to pay for one for some time. You're forced to make the decision between driving fast and suffering on a later stage, or driving slow and- oh hold on, I got a better time. That's the beauty of it, the game teaches you to drive slow without ♥♥♥♥ing up, and thereby saving you tens of seconds.   Contrast this with Dirt 2 and Dirt 3. You'd start with cars that go too fast, handle terribly, your only clue for how to drive is a literal rainbow road and instead of a proper tutorial or forcing you to learn your car, those games just had a mulligan button. As soon as you learned how that first car drove, every car after would be a cakewalk. Dirt Rally shows that you can have proper teaching tools AND be fun AND be a completely realistic simulation at the same time, and it's very much to Codemasters' credit for achieving that.  There's some excellent asymmetric multiplayer going on. The last few Codemasters games did have online leaderboards but this game takes that aspect and really runs with it. You can create your own league where your friends can join in and post times on specific events, any time of day they want. It's a great way to keep a group of friends competing with each other.  I do have one complaint: Dirt Rally could do with some optimization. Some stages play at a stable 120+ FPS, others might dip below 30 on the exact same settings, including weather. Setting weather to High (not Low, which is slower) and trees to Very Low helps. It's odd.  This game has some great voice acting. It's only one actor, he only plays one role, and he's your copilot. There's genuine nervousness in the way he reads his notes, at times he skips a beat and you just know going through all this he's pumped up on adrenaline. It's the perfect way to fill in the silence left by the menu music, and lends a lot to the game's serious racing atmosphere. Though the fact that he makes wrong calls is a bit unnerving. Not sure if that's a bug.  I heartily recommend this game.",

We wanted a return to serious rally racing sims without the brotard, Mountain Dew-fueled poop of the previous DiRT games. You just KNEW Colin McRae was rolling around in his grave. So, the Codies, likely sick of hearing the complaining released the single most soul crushing, nut grinding rally game ever in DiRT Rally. It's a rally sim. There's nary a car-fu (or whatever stupid name that stunt event had in previous entries) and this game will eat your soul. It's everything we wanted and I couldn't be happier with it!!!  At this early stage of play, I suck really, really hard at it. I have all of the assists on and, counting penalties, I finish each race stage in just under six weeks. My 17-month-old daughter could do at least as well. But when you do something right, you know it happened because you got good at something and were not just lucky. It's rare with modern games that a video game rewards learned skill. When you start doing things right in DiRT Rally, it's completely rewarding.",

            "review_text": "Short version. Dirt Rally is an immersive and challenging racing game, but with questionable driving physics. Meaning it was fun to learn, but it finally got tiresome.  I have a lot of hours in this game and I did enjoy it, so it seems unfair to give it a negative review. But I stopped playing it for two months and when I recently came back, I couldn't finish a stage! I now realize that this is a difficult arcade game; the challenge is addictive and is complemented by pleasant visuals, great sound design and fine racing tracks. But the driving model is unintuitive, with arguably inaccurate physics.   Tarmac handling is bad. The rear wheels are very light and drifty, and braking is vague; wheel lock occurs very late. It was so bad for the Hillclimb cars that they had to patch it. But it remains terrible for the RX supercars.    Gravel has more balanced grip, but it is too high! You can annihilate Vatanen's time in Pike's Peak.   Grip in Sweden seems to come and go haphazardly... you can't drive aggressively!   Finland has absurd jumps and is too wide.    Vehicles feel very stiff; they bounce too much from small bumps.    Cars lack rotational momentum. Combined with the high gravel grip, using the handbrake is too easy, and Scandinavian flicks are ineffective for most cars. Without the handbrake, there is a lot of understeer! Except for the RWDs, which have incredible lift-off oversteer (R5 and Manta excluded).   Car dynamics look unnatural in replays; cars seems to be rotating around a central axis.   Career mode is quite repetitive, and you need to spend game credits to participate in events.   Car repair is odd; you can repair parts 1% at a time.   The automatic reset when hitting spectators or going off track is jarring.  Again, the game is good if you are looking for a challenging rally experience. But given that is it described as the 'most authentic rally game ever made' I can't recommend it.",

The game starts you off in career only being able to afford 2 cars, and here on out the only way to buy better cars is to win events. Sounds easy? Well, You need to take into account paying for your crew. They have a limited amount of use throughout the events, if you dont have a decent crew or pay for a cheap crew, less work will be done to the car in your half an hour slot.   Overall, the graphics are good, sound is awesome to me. The cars generally sound powerful.   Also, it has pikes peak. Recreated and looks fantastic.

It's a game breaker. It feels like this game sustained every great part from Dirt 3 and compressed it with all there is in rally to become probably the best rally-sim of 2015.  In short, updated graphics, great mechanics and outstanding enviromental details.  I have friends who have tried out my steeringwheel at home. After their experience, they are know convinced to get a steering wheel and start becoming a part of the racing scene!  10/10",

Game sits more on the sim side of things, especially compared to previous Dirt titles. Focus this time around (as evidanced by the title) is Rally, however there is also Hillclimb, and Rallycross available.   Do not buy this if you do not have a controller or wheel, you'll have a hard time using a keyboard.  A note on the stages: not counting Hillclimb and Rallycross, there's 6 locales with 12 stages each, each locale uses 6, two long (~10KM) stages, each cut in half to make 6, each with a reverse run for 12 total. Stages average between 2:30 and 8:30 to run, depending on skill, length, and class of car.  Hillclimb features Pikes Peak, both fully paved and mixed surface, and you can run it in sectors, or the entire course in one go.  Rallycross is licensed, and features 3 locales with multiple layouts for each.  Car classes and numbers are: 2 60's FWD cars 4 70's RWD cars 2 80's RWD cars 2 Group B RWD cars 5 Group B 4WD cars 3 Group A 4WD cars 2 F2 Kit Car FWD cars 4 2000's 4WD Cars 2 R4 4WD cars 4 2010's 4WD cars 3 4WD Hillclimb cars 6 Rallycross Super cars  At the end of the day, if you like sim/sim-ish (depending on who you ask) physics, and previous Dirt titles left you wanting more in the way of rally, then this is your game. If you like Gymkahana and other such spetacle, or want an arcadey racing game, look elsewhere (Dirt 3 for example).",

The graphics are great, but not quite PCars level, and the detail on the road surfaces and weather effects (which both impact how your car handles) make you feel like you are really driving a rally car. This game is also incredibly well optimised and will run well on most rigs.  The only downside to this game I can think of is there aren't that many cars relative to other games, and I have found the rallycross mode to be quite underwhelming.  Other than that, I'd highly recommend this anyone who enjoys racing games.",

But, I can only recommend this to people who are seriously into simulation racing games, and also understand the challenge of rally racing compared to a normal race track. Just because you're good at a game like Forza on a controller, or you did well playing the rally tracks on DiRT 3, doesn't mean you'll be good at this, and here is a few reasons why.  I've been playing DiRT Rally for two hours, and I haven't had the chance to finish a full championship yet. This is due to resetting my progress after two races out of the four in the starting championship, because I was doing so terribly. Even if I have a race where I haven't crashed once and I think I'm doing okay, I'm losing by 30 seconds at the end. Because there's no options on how difficult your opponents are like a lot of racing games have.  Another thing is that you need to pay lots of attention to your assistant who tells you what turns and bumps are coming up. And if you think you can just stick to a driving line, too bad. There is NO option for a driving line in this game, even for braking only, and that bugs me.  The car settings are a lot more complex compared to your usual driving sim, and actually plays an important role in how your car handles the extreme conditions. You can play other racing simulations and stick to the default car settings and probably be fine, but if you don't understand the settings much in this and don't have the patience to test stuff and learn how it all works, this game might not be for you.   And lastly, if you're one of those players who like to restart an unlimited amount of times just until you get it right, you won't have fun with this. Championship series' in DiRT Rally, or the first championship available to play atleast, only allows 5 restarts over the four races. And you're more than likely going to mess up badly and want to restart, otherwise you'll have to 'recover' your car and put up with being severely time penalised.  If you have the patience to play the first championship over and over again and continue losing, maybe you'll earn up enough experience points and money to race some cars that you'll like better and have a better crew for car settings, then you can have a go at some different championship tournaments. But if you're not good at rally games and what I've written above applies to you, you'll probably be stuck on the same thing for longer than you can tolerate.  Big ups to Codemasters for creating an insanely challenging rally game, and thankyou for scrapping the dudebro loser voice that makes DiRT 3 and GRID 2 hard to tolerate.",

It starts you off relitvely simple with a front wheel drive 60's rally car. It's a great learning car and really helps to earn you the money to get the stronger cars with different drive terrains. I really enjoyed the tuning on the cars as well. It took me a while to be able to confidently tune my car and with each new car comes a new tune to learn. The game helps simplify this a little by offering a simple tuning page and a complex one. I highly seguest this game with both a controller and a wheel. I've enjoyed the game so far doing both. Expect to crash a lot and not come in first for a while if this is your first rally game.

Would have liked to feel like my car selection is based on engineering preference but it comes down to a much simpler formula of finding the best car in each category. But this is an Arcade racer, not a simulator.   I'm enjoying it immensely when I don't have to race AI in RallyCross. The AI will fishtail, t-bone, and rear end you as a team. They never do it to each other and that makes racing them feel utterly ridiculous. That is a seriously bad flaw that destroys immersion like a shotgun to the balls.  I definitely recommend this game but wait for it to go on sale. It's not worth full price as it is now and probably won't ever be. There just isn't enough truly enjoyable content. Rally is a great mode that this game excells in but Hill Climb and Rally Cross just blow all that Rally does right. Yes, there are a ton of cars to unlock, however, once you've driven one in each segment, you've driven all of them. The only major differences are in engine placement and drive wheel setup. And for each setup? They all drive the same.  I have to say though that the Team Management aspect does make you feel like you're a part of the Rally circuit. It's cool picking your engineers and trying to optimize your cars' needs based on each one's basic flaws. It adds a layer of immersion that not all racing games are capable of doing.  I feel the need to mention the distinct lack of realism in the reflection of finite details such as running your car in to a wall at 80mph sideways, then driving away in a straight line with almost zero change to handling and acceleration. That is what makes this a mostly arcade racer. There are sim elements but things like alignment never going bad, repairable tires, being able to grind on your driveshaft like a skateboard without snapping it in half, and your vehicle's uncanny ability to take critical real world damage and keep on keeping on is just silly.  Fortunatley, this is a very fun game that offers hours and hours of enjoyment.  Don't spend more than $30 on this game. It's fun but it's not great.",

Only game i've seen with a Hill Climb A lot of choice to drive in and even maps with many more updates containing new maps Feedback on wheel is amazing Will have PVP Anticheat for leaderboards (Also a con kinda since it not prefect yet but they will get it.) They are trying for mod support which regardless if it happens or doesn't I think it matter they are trying.

My history in racing games started with Grand Turismo 3, on the ps2. That was considered a 'racing simulator' and was challenging at the time. From there it went GT4, GT5, some DiRT 3 and a little bit of Forza. I would put DiRT Rally on par with Forza in the way the cars take damage and how that damage is felt by the player. Blow a tire and you will know it when you lose traction, power, and steering control. The different surfaces also handle differently. Snow is different than gravel and is different than ice which is different than dirt. It can take some time getting adjusted to each different road type when you are going from one event to the next.  The games progression is very rewarding, you have to learn the cars you drive in order to progress at any real pace. There is also a nice progression for mastering a car you really like. I personally enjoy the Mini, which is a very low 'tier' car, but I am able to progress with that car and go to larger and larger championships.  I would recommend this game to anyone who is very into rally racing or racing in general. It is not for those enjoy arcade or need for speed type racing games. This would be a perfect game however if you are looking to move on from that genre. Can be frustrating at times but also incredibly rewarding.",

Each car has its own feeling to it and even with assist on, that feeling does not go away. Locations for rallies are also wonderful and realistic.   As dirt rally is off road simulation, sometime it is bit frustrating as the gameplay is unforgiving. you loose concentration for a split second and you'll pay for that mistake dearly. Not the game to play, if you are looking for casual sunday morning 'relaxing' game play. But such engaged gameplay is the reason you would want to play this again and again and try to improve each corners and cuts.  On my budget gaming rig graphics also look stunning and also it is playing on pc controller. All in all, great value for money.   Codemasters are going to have tough time beating their own game in future releases.  My recommendation : Essential buy",

Here is my review for DiRT Rally!  To simplify things a bit, let me split this into separate 'categories'   1. Graphics  The Graphical quality of this game is intense, probably one of the best graphically designed games I've ever played. From the track, to the grass, to the trees, and to the vehicles - this is one helluva beautiful game.   2. Realism The amount of realism in DiRT Rally is amazing, from on-track performance to off-road performance, It's incredible.   3. Vehicles DiRT Rally offers a great amount of vehicles. From Rally Racing, Hillclimb, to Rallycross! The variety of vehicles are fairly good, enough to fit everybody's vehicle interests.   4. Single &amp; Multiplayer  Just as any racing game, DiRT Rally provides us with our usual Single-Player mode, but in addition to this, we now have the option to play on the Multiplayer game mode! Want to race some friends, or some random opponents? This game is for you.   5. Controls  The control setup is so easy it's nearly flat-out stupid, as DiRT Rally supports PC Gamers, plus Console Gamers! Let's not forget our good ol' Steering Wheel.   6. ESRB Rating  The fun part of the game is that anybody can play it, there are no age restrictions at all. As the game is rated 'E' for 'Everyone', everyone is welcome to play, of course!   My opinion? $49.99 is definitely worth spending for DiRT Rally.",

Now, DiRT Rally is utterly amazing. The physics have improved astronomically and are so close to really life it's not even funny.

There should be a warning when purchasing cars that you can't even use for the chamipionship until 20 events later. (I kept saving up using my 60's mini to buy an M3, thinking I will be doing 80s events after getting it, then I found out you have to progress from the 60s to the era that you want to play. Come on Codemaster, just make all eras available at once, most people born in the 1980s wouldn't have much interest in those 1960 or 70s old school cars)  3. Give us the option to turn off not only the main menu music, but also the ones between race loading, that music is not appealing to everyone, and to me it is annoying.  4.

Engine sounds are very poor, they all seem generic in flavour.  CO-Driver, Sounds bored and often gets stages wrong or misses out crucial parts including in one stage a complete hairpin.  To Sum up, A hardcore Sim that will have very limited appeal. Dirt 3 was alot better in being more open to all skill levels, This game has been produced by and for the top 5% of rally sim fans. A fact that is obvious when you see there is very little diffirence in the AI set at various levels.

Now i've battled through and unlocked quite a bit.. one of the special events you get early on is a Monster Energy RallyX stage!. Now that sounds awesome!!. Well, before we can do that we need to complete 6 events of standard RallyX. Now up until this point i have seen the A.I but not raced along side them, with the depth and effort put into this game i didn't even think twice. So i jump into a RallyX with a nicely made Tune and get ready to take on my 5 opponent A.I, then as i pull ahead from the start line (my car was tuned so i had the advantage here) everything was going well. Then i get rammed um the ♥♥♥, spun sideways and pushed 100m until the stupid A.I decided to turn. I tried again and again and again, with all sorts of tactics and tunes. Don't get me wrong its not impossible to win, i won lots of races and i'm sitting 1 event away from my goal. I have noticed that this is no glitch. these F#$%ing A.I just give no F%$#s they dont recognise the players car and movements in any way shape or form.   Now at this point i have given up, the joy of this game being are ripped away by this stupid little mistake. although it's no little mistake, this is a SIMULATION Rally game that hits most Simulation Standards.

Another thing and that really was a nail to the coffin is steering wheel support is total rubbish, devs need some lessons from SMS studios (Project Cars) how to handle force feedback (and car physics)  Those two things are most important things in a racing game so all the rest which admittedly looks very nice cannot be enjoyed without sorting out basics.

Please don't base how a car handles on what a race driver tells you in a interview. If the 70's rally cars you have programmed into this game actually held on to the road like you have depicted the race drivers piloting them back in the seventies would have all died in a horrific fiery inferno.

I enjoyed both Dirt 2 and 3 quite a lot, they were fun laid-back introductions to the world of rally I knew so little about. Coming from games like F1 20XX, GRID, Forza, the Dirt games were neat and enjoyable transitions.   But Dirt Rally is a different beast. Dirt Rally, as the product title implies, is designed with a different audience in mind. That audience played Dirt 3 and wished for NO flashbacks, even more bumps and cambers, and far more punishing and consequential handling. There are also a litany of other great features that fulfill those desires and even some I didn't know I wanted. For example, vehicles now sustain all damage incurred across the various stages of an event. Messed up your suspension in Stage 1? Be prepared to suffer a time penalty in Stage 3 repairing it, or if you choose not to, suffer the handling penalty. As a result, the rally career feels far more immersive than Dirt 2/3 ever was for me.   My main point here, especially after seeing numerous 'negative' reviews is that Dirt Rally and Dirt 3 (and the like) are DIFFERENT games for essentially a different audience.   If you enjoyed and were satisfied with Dirt 2/3, I wouldn't necessarily recommend Dirt Rally. However, if you enjoyed Dirt 3 but constantly found yourself yearning for far more challenge, realism and consequences, then please, please play this game.    ",

For me, however, the feedback is what really sets DiRT Rally apart. It's a motorheads wet dream! With the recent addition of the rumble emulator for the steam controllers, the game has really come to life for me. The haptic feedback really connects you to the road and comunicates what the car is doing, and how it reacts to the road surface. The SFX are brilliant, you can drive by ear and listen to the revs for perfect shifts. The exhaust notes are music to my ears with all the right crackles and bangs in the most perfectly accurate places. The car moans and groans when it gets damaged, older cars have rattles, and the stones hitting the bottom of the car. Incredibly immersive attention to detail. 10/10 Don't hesitate do buy!",

It is very challenging for even experienced sim racers but equally quite approachable for more casual drivers who fancy a bit of rally action.  Great graphics, if you have played any of the Dirt series games you will already be familiar with the style Codemasters use and it works really well in this game. The environments feel alive and the special effects are well done, take a drive on rally Sweden at night in the snow and you will notice the spectators camp fires for example. Runs smoothly on higher detail settings with mid range hardware which is a bonus.  The sound engine is impressive with cars popping and crackling while crowds of spectators can be heard cheering, birds singing and the co driver reels off his notes. Gravel bounces off the undertray of the car as you drive. Good job here too.  Gameplay has come a long way since early access. Codemasters have worked hard to get the FFB feeling more connected to the car and happily their efforts are reflected in the experience. Effects are convincing as jumps and bumps come through nicely. Steering feels accurate and the game overall is very enjoyable to play. Those of you lucky enough to have a wheel, pedals, H pattern shifter and handbrake will be glad to know that all devices are supported and add to the feel of the game. For instance if you spin and forget to push the clutch in the car will stall, if you don't time your shifts correctly gears crunch and damage the transmission etc. Sound like obvious things but i have other race sims on my computer that don't model them correctly at all!  The game has a good deal of content with many different car classes from old Mini Coopers to Group B car, 90's Subaru's to the WRC Championship winning VW Polo from 2015. You can do Rallycross (if thats your thing) or race up Pikes Peak in the USA. But the game is best at doing rally stages, with 6 different countries represented, all of which require different driving techniques and styles to master.  This is my surprise driving game of the year and totally exceeded my expectations. I was on the fence about Codemasters race games after being disappointed with the F1 series and the stagnation of the recent Dirt titles but this game is a must buy for anyone with even a glimmer of interest in rallying or sim racing in general.",

They progressively went for flashier visuals, more rockin' soundtracks and less challenge. Dirt rally brings back the glory days with a punishing rally experience. Gone are rewind, visual braking hints, gymkhana and Franz Ferdinand to make way for a pure, uncluttered racing experience. The game demands that you master the courses in order to trim every millisecond possible off your time. Cars aren't simply given to you by landing sponsors as in later Dirt games. This means that you start out by grinding away in FWD rally cars from the 1960s to move up to higher classes of cars and events.   I give an extra thumbs up for the sound design: your copilot's voice intensifies as your speed increases, gravel and rocks can be heard hitting the underside of the car as you barrel down narrow roads, and you can actually hear the brake pads deteriorate. This is only the icing on a cake, though. It’s a cake made of excellent handling simulation, beautifully stark visuals, deep enough car and crew customization, a clean interface, and gumption - and man is it delicious.",

The physics are up there with some of the best ever seen in a rally game which is a refreshing change for Codemasters who have sometimes allowed accessibility to erode realism and longevity.  The graphics are cutting edge but run liquid smooth on decent hardware. There's no stutters or jitter that have plagued other recent sims like Project CARS or even the mighty Assetto Corsa. This smoothness and the excellent camera angles make watching replays and admiring your drifts/powerslides/scandinavian flicks very satisfying in a way that reminds me of Richard Burns Rally. The rain, water and night-time headlight effects are the best ever seen in a rally game and add a tremendous amount of immersion.  The cockpit graphics are extremely good and it's great seeing the co-driver reading the notes (which are also good for the most part and rarely too early/late like many other rally games)  The sounds are beautifully made as well and although they may not sound fully realistic to the actual cars sometimes, they are always satisfying and meaty.  PC Gamer claims that it's 'not a sim' but I'd take issue with that. I'm a sim snob and am normally quick to dismiss other games as not being simulations but DiRT Rally ticks most of the important boxes that sim racers look for. The suspension, weight transfer and tyre grip modelling are excellent and that's more than can be said for some simulations.  This is another one of those games that prove that often realistic games are more fun than 'fun' games.  Highly recommended - no need to wait until it's on sale.",

CodeMasters was at one time my favorite racing game maker, until the last two GRID games. This game however has made me remember the great titles of yesteryear and restored my faith in this company. they listened to the community and did their best to put in this game what the fans have been asking for since the early Colin McCrae days, and it is AWESOME. There is no game out now in the Rallye genre that can compete with DIRT. The physics are spot on and the content is pure. I am not a fan of Pikes peak or the Rally Cross, but, still respect their decision to include them as not everyone wants to play just rallye. The one thing I can say they could have improved on is the amount of stages and countries that are included in the game. Maybe they will add some as DLC after the console release, and this is the first time I have ever said that I would want and be happy to pay for DLC. It is a lot of effort and time to recreate the stages as painstaking close to reality as they went for in this title and can understand the cost of such an endeavor. I would gladly recommend this to any one who has been looking for a real Rallye title since RBR and this is it. I own WRC5 and all the previous WRC titles and looked at the LOeb title and this by far is the best out. Don't waste your money on the WRC title, even though they have the license, they haven't justified the privledge of said license. It will be a fine day when CM can snatch that license and put the effort of this title in and make a TRUE WRC title that we as fans have been hoping for.",

A good mix of cars to choose from, and it doesn't lake long to build enough cash to buy more powerful versions of your favorite road cars, or dirt purpose monsters, such as those used in the hillclimb events. It's a good mix of the old and new as well, classic race cars like the Ford Escort and Mini, which were immensely successful in the 70's, through to the Lancia, or Subaru WRX of the modern era. The game is a little geared towards the console market, primarily in the menu's etc, but works well on the PC platform, without it being an horrendous compromise which has befallen other titles gone by.

Now i dont live on a farm anymore, so no more dirt jumping. Now i can get in the Escort MK2 and sometimes, just sometimes, i can relive that feeling. what a rush. Nah but seriously, Like.. are you still here? Buy the game, and cry. just start crying now so you dont have to later, becuase if you think you are going to just keep restarting the race until you come in first, you are highly, highly mistaken. You will busy your *&amp;% just trying to podium. I have a couple top 500 scores on forza 4 drift leaderboards and a top 300 score on DIRT 1 pikes peak hillclimb leaderboard so i know how to drift/rally. This game will PWN you.

The only thing i have to complain about is there is not enough deversity of tracks. A lot of the tracks are repeats but reverse or longer. I hope now this game is not Eearly Access anymore that they continue with this fanastic sim by added DLC free or paid with more tracks. And focus in the rally stages and less on rallycross. Add some more hillclimbs also.",

At this point the game starts being very rewarding and fun.  Anyway, since this game counts to racing simulation software, it displays that as accurate, as a game can do it.  The Graphic looks awesome, and the game runs very stable in all! (I honestly can't remember if it crashed once or even had FPS-drops).  First 30h I played it with a controller, which was useless imo.

(Before I proceed this review contains my personal experience with the game, do not buy this game based solely on my review.)  Introduction: I have a G27 Logitech steering wheel and I always have played truck sim games, however I was looking for something faster paced and requires me to be on my toes. I was quite hesitant to get this game at first after many Youtubers and previous dirt owners mentioned that this game was much more realistic and the controls were much more real life (harder), with that in mind I was wondering if I could cope as I never played rally games before. (Just for your info, I have a real life manual license.)  Dirt Rally itself: I had many failures in the beginning as I took up Rallycross as my first championship and I failed so horribly that I felt like asking for a refund, however I went on Reddit and Youtube and saw how people tackled corners and went through the video lessons provided by the game and it all paid off. In no time I was at least able to keep up with the cars ahead of me and I was quite happy that there was progress, next I wanted to be able to overtake those cars and I found out that I had my traction control on which was limiting my revs and so I turned it off. I also set the game to automated launch control and I had starts which were quicker than my manual launches. All these settings and the advanced car tuning made me so much faster (as much as 5 seconds off my overall time), this allowed me to get first on quite a number of occasions and allowed me to progress in my career. I am now tackling rallies and I am much more of a confident driver, I would like to thank Codemasters for this awesome game. ",

I like rally games, because it's just you against the clock. There are n stupid AI opponets, that push you of the track and make you lose in the last minute.  The game looks and feels nice. It isn't the most amazing looking game, but it looks good enough. The sound is pretty good, there is no annoying rock music playing in the background when you race. The co-driver calls are also pretty good. However they aren't always very precise and it would be nice, to be able to edit each call individually and not only adjust the general announcing timing.  The driving feels very satisfying. Each car feels differently and has a learning curve to it, which is nice. However I wouldn't call this game a sim. I mean it's definetly not an arcade racer, but the damage model for example is far from being real. You can also adjust your car. And you have to repair the car between stages. But this is another point, you can repair different components of your car in 1% increments. How is that supposed to be relaistic?`This isn't really a problem for me, I just wnat to point out, that people aren't really correct if they say, this game is a hardcore racing sim.  In single player every car is also unlocked. So there is no progression system, which is awesome. You can try every car on every track you want. and this is great. This way you can also learn the tracks, which is necessary to be able to win even against the lowest difficulty AI. And here comes my first gripe. There are no rewinds. I understand that there are none in the online modes, but why not in single player? You can say it's more realistic and what not, but why not make them optional, like the other assists. Sometimes it's really frustrating, to have to restart a race because you crashed in the second to last corner after a 10km track.  My other gripe is, that the hillclimb mode isn't really well fleshed out. There are only 4 cars available and Pikes Peak as the only track. It would have been nice if there were more cars and tracks for this mode.  Another thing I don't understand, is why you can't race all cars on all tracks. It would be interesting to see how a WRC car performs at pikes peak. It would have been a nice gimmick I think.  Rallycross is also there, however I found this mode pretty boring and didn't play it that much.  Thankfully there are no stupid Gymkhana events, and the game doesn't constantly harass you, to put your replays on Youtube, like Dirt 3 did. And the developers are aware of that, since trhere is a hint to it in the game.  I'm glad, that this game is about the rallying experience and not a whole bunch of other crap. I seriosly how that codemasters continue from here on to make great rally games with more cars and more tracks. And that this game shows that there is a demand for authentic rally games without all the tacked on rubbish",

DiRT Rally has quality over quantity and I can forgive that JUST THIS TIME cause they were doing it as a prove of concept of some sorts so that's why I got the game at the highest price I ever paid in a game on Steam to support this kind of quality game :) But the next one WILL have to get more content! and yeahhh I'm a tight-fisted gamer and I only get expensive games when they are fully finished and I can see if they are worth the money judge me :)  I just loved that simple approach you know...that Gran Turismo like menu where it's easy and simple to move and the soundtrack is at least more classy than other DiRT games! Too bad it's just a few songs cause the guy that did it is awesome! BUT there is ppl that can get annoyed by soundtracks like this so please add a custom soundtrack option in the new games it can't be THAT difficult!
