Breach &amp; Clear: DEADline Rebirth is a new and greatly improved version of B&amp;C: Deadline, the follow-up to Breach &amp; Clear, the critically acclaimed hybrid tactical strategy game.",

It's actually alot more active, so you can change unit orders on the fly if needed. Rather than being short ops against set enemies it's an open world with semi random encounters. Deadline also uses this to add a more RPG aspect to the game, even going so far as to have side quest. As usual with any zombie games the bigger threat seems to be other humans so get ready for that. All in all I've enjoyed this game, and fans of the original probably would too.",

            "review_text": "B&amp;C Deadline is an interesting port of B&amp;C into a zombie story, with both real-time and precise tactical moves, as well as a detailed RPG system and some limite crafting and outfitting. Add this to a zombie landscape where you help survivors fight your way through both zeds and human renegades, in a semi-free-form encounter-based campaign, and you have one heck of a game, if a bit hard.   The original B&amp;C is purely counter-terrorism... You need to move a 4-men section of CT specialists through various levels in a turn-based mode where they will determine for themselves who to shoot at and when. Your job is to get them there by flanking. In B&amp;C deadline, the zeds don't shoot back, but the renegades will. The problem is there's usually a lot more zeds and some of them can be quite nasty.   The prologue, which also serves as tutorial, teaches you the basics like movement, facing, first-aid, suppression, and so on. Now, the system was changed to be pausable real-time. Hit pause to issue orders like move, use special ability, and so on. Or you can move in real-time. The trick of course, is there's almost no cover in real-time so it's only suitable if you run into a handful of zeds.   Periodically you run into larger herds, and they will rush you. The trick is find enough cover and have your team sufficiently spread out to provide overlapping fields of fire. Flanking shots do a lot more damage than frontal shots. The nasty part is the Zeds can come from all directions, and forgetting to pay attention and move to better cover can be lethal.   You start having been shot down over a major metro area, and your squad was all that made it. You run around the map for supply crates and bonus crates with special equipment, from armor to gun enhancements, from night viz to first aid kits. And ammo, you can never have too much amo when your'e in a zombie apocalypse. As you try to make it to shelter, you run into loads and loads of zeds.   Playing this through a few missions makes it clear: turtiling does NOT work. You can't expect to sit behind barriers and shooting to stop the big herds, even with four guns on your side. A grenade would help but you only have so many of them. You have to properly exploit each character's speciality to get through the missions.   And there sure are a lot of them, both random and campaign scripted.   The scrap system is back, but the scraps 'dissipate' if you don't pick them up right away. And that is bad for your bottom line, as you need them to upgrade and more.   All in all, this is a worthy expansion of the B&amp;C franchise. if you like tactical combat games, and can stand zombies for short bursts, give this a try.",

Zombies have been done many different times in many different ways, but the interesting thing about Breach and Clear is the tactical command aspect. Having tactical control over a few different soldiers that are right in the middle of the outbreak is interesting to say the least. The writing isn't stellar, but thats not what people who are looking for a zed-grinding simulator are looking for and BnC does satisfy the need to kill vast amounts of zombies pretty well. The bugs are minor and with some polish this could be a real gem to niche group of gamers.  DO buy this game if you enjoy XCOM or Shadowrun returns, AND are looking for more of the same thing but with more zombies and gear building, and less plot.  Don't buy this game if you would rather run and gun your way through the hoard, you'll never make it.",

This game has great RPG elements and some loot collection that I love and keep me interested in exploration and replay. I will say that the game can be buggy, my first play I had a game breaking glitch, after that it was pretty smooth until recently but most of the bugs are easy to fix with a quick restart. That said the developers seem to be constantly working on fixes and updating the game with patches that actually make the game experience better as a whole and not just minor fixes. I think they have some more work to do and I would love to see some DLC or patches to include more content, but the game as it stands is so much fun to play and totally worthwhile.",

The game has a Borderlands-esque feel to it I might add. It has an interesting interface for you to use to organize your units if you're playing solo that can be a bit tedious to the point that AI would be a bit more welcomed but the system is a good way to micromanage your team so they don't die. If you and your buddies are looking for your next co-op adventure, look no further.",

            "review_text": "I have always been a fan since its first release on Android, played the hell out of it on Kindle HDX, spent $12 of in-app coins, maxed Team out 3x on 3 devices. This is a whole different twist, kind of Tactically played like Dragon Age Origins (with Pauses/planning), but in a Left 4 Dead world, without the T&amp;A chicks. Kind of a knockoff, but not as repetitive as L4D, single player. Love the flares attracting hords, while tossing cocktail right into them, or laying down claymore mines for the Rushers trying to hit from behind. My favorite Suppressing Fire is still effective, but eats up the limited ammo.  From what I'm hearing, it's not a full game. I hardly noticed that, with less bugs than majority of games out there, still addictive to play! The issues are the story is predictable, slightly dry, and NPCs don't have audio dialogue like the player's team already has a bit of, nor do they move or do anything on their own. Not a whole lot of action other than shooting everything that moves, unlike original B&amp;C that had Bomb Disarming, Terrorist hunt, and Escape modes that kept it fun.  Gameplay is still great, with sometimes being overwhelmed by zombies from behind, while being shot at by Mercs, and no where to run. A lot of customizing perks tree is available when leveling up your team, but no individual stats. Hopefully they add more to this incomplete game, but still well worth the dirt cheap price of this game!   Hope someday, Might Rabbit expands more than handful of staff members, and even has more online players/servers for Breach &amp; Clear franchise. The rate of leveling is very slow with bland story, so it would be great to use your team online more often, if more people played. ",

            "review_text": "This is an enjoyable little hybrid tactical squad / horde shooter game. In the wake of a zombie infection you control a four man military team against masses of zombies and other survivors trying to achieve your mission. You can do this by issuing orders to you team and micromanaging their every move or taking control of one and having the rest follow. You can swap between these seamlessly as the situation dictates and this system works nicely in the game, allowing it to keep a good pace. The game includes a character levelling system, varied equipment, and a difficulty that scales nicely as the game progresses.  I enjoy playing this game. I enjoy playing this game A LOT.  But it is painfully bugged, and feels unfinished. There are parts of it that are poliished to perfection and I get the feeling these were the parts that the Developers found interesting and enjoyed working on. The rest is in need of a lot of work.  Positives:     A well thought out character and equipment levelling system.     A nicely realised World environment, with the city in ruins.     'Dungeons' for when you don't feel like following a story, and just want a blast.     Achievements that are fair and feel rewarding to accomplish.  Negatives:     The bugs and glitches. There are plenty...      The story feels disjointed and needs cleaning up. It loses track easily, and you often feel like you missed something.     Lots of uneccessary 'filler' in the game. A cover system where 99% of your enemies use melee, for example.  Conclusion:  I really feel like this is a missed opportunity for a great game. It needs a lot of work to make this happen, but it is well within the realms of possibility. It is receiving regular updates, and I hope these will help polish out these problems, but until then I cannot recommend this game, even though I really want to. When this happens, I will gladly change to a thumbs up.",

The developers has made a brave attempt to revive it with the Rebirth patch, but the core gameplay is simply not fun enough.  It's too shallow for an RPG, too fast-paced for a tactical game, too simple for a strategy game, and has too poor AI for an action game. The skill-trees of your soldiers are more like the stem of a tree, instead of branching out in different viable ways, and the quest system is simply talk to NPC, get quest, with no dialogue options at all. You can't even reject quests. The zombies are quite straightforward, as you'd expect them to be, while hostile NPCs will retreat to cover and possibly return fire. Strategic choises are very limited, once you have picked your squad you are pretty much set. What's left is to pick which gear to use, as in what brand of assault rifle for your assault rifle guy.  So no, I can not recommend this game. It's not all bad, but the things that are bad are so big that I can't disregard them. And most importantly, the game just isn't fun.",
