I really enjoyed the game in the past BUT now at these levels when i`ve ranked up all buildings to the max and most of fortifications(didnt spend a cent btw) there's nothing to do than spending money to upgrade units in the command bunker which costs 4.000.000 or maybe a lot more + 20 days(?!?!!) of wait time??? Also its IMPOSSIBLE to gather that much when at around 500.000 i get attacked and lose money. Only camo will do the trick, but still not worth spending gold bars for it. It's embarrassing when you almost fully fortified your buildings and every attacker STILL destroys your base at 95%+++. Like really??I`ve made it this far to get stomped like that? Even units glitch most of the time when they cant reach the specific target and they start to run around which results in a huge fail/loss. Nonoooo... i won`t recommend it for sure. First it was somewhat cool but now its only a waste of time.  PS: Those 4 charges of Artillery Strikes in the communication center building is a disgrace. GG enemy base",

This game is a mobile game. The game wants you to connect to Facebook. Like many mobile games that try to get you to connect to Facebook, is plagued by the need to constantly pay to speed up building/upgrading process. That means that all of the game's mechanics are build around the idea of being as tedious and bothersome as possible to try to get some money. Of course many players will stop playing as soon as they realize what the game is all about but that's okay because these kind of developers are not interested in entertainment, they just want to get money. So if you don't want to pay, you are not the target of this game. It's almost impossible to recommend this game even to people that enjoy these kind of mechanics, because most of them probably have already 'invested' in another game like this one, and considering this game has nothing new to offer, they won't be interested in playing the same game they are playing but with different graphics.

I did not have this problem before the update....It's been at least 2 weeks since the update so they've had time to fix something as simple as this...also, the AI do not always work/target what they're supposed to. Tanks for example went through several walls, targeted something behind another and decide to go ALL THE WAY AROUND THE ISLAND while being gunned by MG's and such just to go through an opening...They've had plenty of time to fix this too....Good game but they've goofed pretty bad.",

While i doubt i would have even thought about getting this game if it cost money, having a free, 5 minutes session game that can get very competitive with steam friends is actually quite fun. Its great to cool down off after a long gaming session and since it is so quick to start up you can start opening a new game and play this to fill the time waiting for it to load. I would reccomend this game, but only really if you and a few friends get it together and I would warn you all to not assume its a bad clone of clash of clans, rather its clash of clanes hundreds of years in the future (in the game i mean)",

When I first started there were a lot more supplies to be had, now there is really no way to save enough to upgrade defences further. Example: I'm at level 65 with 2400 dog tags; I can only find around 200,000 supplies in an average battle (and even this takes a lot of searching), but it costs me 130,000 to deploy a full army, meaning I only net an average of 70,000 per battle, but need 3,200,000 to upgrade the hangar... If that's not bad enough; as soon as I save up 1,000,000 someone at level 120 with 2800 dog tags will come and take half. Because they take more than I can possibly earn in battle, I will never be able to upgrade beyond my current state. Also, AI is terrible, half of the time my soldiers just pace back and forth in the same spot until time runs out and I lose what would have been a winable match.",

It might become more complex than CoC in late game, and I hope it doesn't require so much time as CoC needed to upgrade buildings at high levels.  I truly recommend this game to anyone who's up to play strategy games from anywhere, from your phone, from your PC.. Because the link you have with your devices it's through Facebook (I have it on my phone already).  So cheer up and start as soon as possible, because this is those kind of games that you'll keep the advantage if u start sooner than others, and obviously, keep playing as hard as u started.",

The Gameplay mechanics is basically the same as CoC-You send troops at the enemy base and watch your troops mindlessly blast and shoot at the enemy.  Like many mobile games,it's full of micro-transaction.(Like 300 gold for 1.99-Seriously?)And the worst thing is in this game P2P=Top of the leaderboards.  Do everybody a favor and do NOT spend money on this game.Instead,try to support the ones who are making good ones.",
