Trying to imagine how people would suffer from your creation would make you sick. Thankfully, all you see is world map and few other windows.  The difficulty the game provides is very flexible. Either go for a smooth killing spree or struggle with cure progress. This game also features A LOT of upgrades for each disease (there are quite many of them which you can unlock).  Come to think about it, it's a strategy game. You start somewhere and expand until you take over the world. Or in that case, kill everyone (though it's not always necessary).  There is also a multiplayer mode. Both versus and co-op are fun to play and can give you quite a challenge.  I'm not really sure what else I should write about this game. Maybe workshop support? Millions of custom scenarios and an editor to make your own? Yeah, I guess I should mention that either. Oh wait, I just did. Anyway, that's all I can say.  If you are into strategy games (or even if you aren't) and don't mind infecting the world, then go ahead and try it.",

            "review_text": "It's the kind of game that when someone walks in on you, you switch to porn becuase it's easier to explain.   10/10 would get mistaken for a terrorist again.  That's... boy, I wish that was just a joke.  That being said, this game requries a lot more strategy than you think. When you first start out, you probably think stealth is the best way to go, until you hit Brutal and your only option is to go hard or get cured. Pretty much every plague type has a mechanic that requires tweaking your strategy, to the point where if you play blind, you have to play several games just to understand what kind of angle you need.  If you're coming from the mobile version, as I did, I would definitely recommend this version. It's not a direct port, more of an upgrade that breathes a little life into a game all about murdering everyone on the planet. Now, I haven't played it as extensively as the mobile version (I bought it on release to support the dev and never played it until recently WHOOPS), but just playing a few co-op rounds with a friend has definitely made this worth it, and the added Workshop functionality means more screaming for everyone. And, IIRC, all updates are free.  A late update: the Shadow Plague is nice, but a little easy once you figure out how it works. Still, the new achievements (even the non-Shadow Plague ones) are relatively fun to get, so not a bad addition at all.    Pros:   Great bubblewrap simulator.   Beating Mega Brutal with bacteria and almost no genes feels really nice, okay.   It makes you feel really smart with all these big fancy words wow look at them all.   Easy to alt-tab out of, for all your alt-tabbing needs. Probably to look at a guide and cry. No judging here, man. That Necroa virus sure is  killer . (Yes, you can hang me now. I've made enough bad jokes.)   The news reel and random events are kind of great. The game has just the right amount of humour for being a game about pathogens.   It just has such a nice draw to it. Makes you feel like a mad scientist kicking back and watching the world burn. (Sometimes literally. What is with these nukes, mate.) A+ ego boost.   Cons:   Greenland.   I'm probably on a watchlist now somewhere, tbh.   Being able to infect everyone after you get noticed didn't really feel right until I remembered standard precautions even in 'rich' countries is actually really poor because no one follows them as rigorously as they should. Not really a con about the game, just a little bit of an unsettling revelation.    Greenland .   Sometimes when you make a mistake, but still obviously going to win (ie, no cure prgoress being made), it takes forever for the game to finish. I've only really noticed this with the Necroa virus because of the zombie mechanic (I'm a scrub I know I know), so it isn't something that happens often, but it's my only real complaint.   I personally just strongly dislike the Necroa virus, which only grows the more I play with it. It's very gimmicky, cured easily (I assume to encourage your inner necromancer.), and just generally the least fun of all of them, even when zombies do start. Since it's part of the mandatory progression line-up, this becomes even more noticeable. I'm not sure what could be done to balance it, though my general frustration suggests buffing the lethality of the few non-zombie symptoms it has.    Maybe it's just because I'm playing on a glorified toaster, but the Steam overlay keeps glitching out and closing on me. I'm going to do some testing on this one as soon as I can. This isn't a game breaker, though.  This is my toaster. Stupid toaster. Can't even toast toast.     Greenland  .   So go get it. Be the change you want to see in the world. And for the love of God, evolve water transmission and cold resistance.",

I mean, I get the way the game works, and I'm not hopeless, but as of this writing, I've put in nearly 100 hours and still haven't unlocked cheats. And while that is largely due to the fact that I don't want to try Bioweapon again, it is also illustrative of why I recommend this game so highly. You don't have to be good at Plague Inc. to play it and have fun with it.  At its core, Plague Inc. is a casual game. You pop bubbles with your finger or mouse, tap or click to choose how your disease progresses, and that's it. However, where this game differs from most casual games is that the developers have created layers of strategy and complexity over that basic framework, layers that individual players can freely embrace or ignore as they see fit. If you don't particularly care about factors like how many uninfected countries have dry climates as opposed to wet climates or how to best target the countries that are advancing cure research, then you can simply ignore them, play on casual, and evolve whatever you feel like. However, if you are looking for more challenge and depth than the average casual gamer, then you can crank up the difficulty to normal. brutal, or even mega-brutal, and carefully plot out which combinations of symptoms, transmission vectors, and other abilities will lead you to victory.  In short, Plague Inc. has something for everyone, from the most casual of casual players ro the hardest of hardcore gamers, and I highly recommend it.  Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go swear and flail uselessly at the new Shadow Plague disease type some more.",

Oh yeah, sometimes it can take multiple minutes to save up points, especially early-game when you haven't infected very many people yet. Also, as a pedantic person it bothers me that you can become 'antibiotic-resistant' as a virus. The game obviously isn't supposed to be scientifically sound, considering it contains zombie viruses, so I'll let that one slide.  ...I always feel slightly guilty when I win a game, too.",

            "review_text": "I've played Plague since early access, and the devs are without doubt some of the best in the industry. Intuitively, you'd think there are only so many times you can destroy the world with your pathogen of choice in a 10-30 minute rampage, but you'd be wrong just like I was.   When I first got the game, there were the standard pathogens to choose from - Bacteria, Virus, Prion - and I'd proceed to destroy the world (Greenland notwithstanding) for 15 minutes at a time in single-player. I played for maybe 4 hours in 15 minute bursts, but soon grew bored.   A year on my GF bugged me into installing it on my old laptop so she could play it.   I looked over her shoulder and saw she was entrenched in a multiplayer battle, her disease fighting to destroy the world before her competitor's, actively seeking to spend her precious little DNA to sabotage her nemesis' pathogen and strengthen her own. I swiftly took the laptop from her and played for the next 4 hours straight.   In my absence, there was now a fully-fledged multiplayer mode - versus or co-op. There were new diseases - Neurax Worm, Simian Flu, Vampires. There were scenarios that forced you into abandoning your tried-and-trusted strategies and finding new ways to kill everyone.  I later found out that many of these changes had come long after the early access period was in the rear-view mirror, which brings me back to my original point - the devs are great.   After its full release, the devs could have moved on, taken on new projects, made more money, but instead they stayed to ensure Plague became a 40-hour game, not a 4-hour game. The reason you'll see reviews that state the PC version's supremacy over the iOS game is because the iOS version is pretty much the Early Access version, comparable to the one I first alluded to - fun for a while, easy to pick-up-and-play, but not the game you sink hours into - whereas the devs continue to work on Plague (Steam version), adding new content and improving gameplay to this day.   This is the only game I've ever bought twice - I bought my GF it so we could play together. I don't recommend doing the same, or if you do avoid Versus mode, because it caused several considerable arguments when one of us did something underhanded to expediate our annihilation of the free world at the others expense. Stick to Co-op.  This game has my highest recommendation. I believe it is one of the most content-rich games available (considering its price) and, given a reasonable chance, could be enjoyed by nearly anyone with a Steam account.",

Your choice of any plague type this game has to offer! It's a lot of fun to create different strategies and figure out the unique puzzles to each disease, and it's incredibly satisfying to watch the spread of your deadly illness.

I was all swole up with patriotism as I watched the American ideology invading every nation on Earth one at a time, blessing the indigenous with the Democratic way and insominous American dream, and killing them all in the process. Just like in real life. And then on one fine evening, a tear was nearly brought to my eye when writ on my screen was 'Victory. Democracy has successfully eliminated all life on Earth.' Finally, the commies and the terrorists were gone. There was only freedom now.  In all seriousness, Plague Inc is an interesting game. It's challenging, more complex than you might imagine, and allows for many choices as you choose the next mutation of your disease, customizing it to the situation at hand in order to, hopefully, exterminate all life on Earth. Before a cure can be developed of course, and before you accidentally cripple your progress, such as through making the disease too lethal, killing the infected before they have a chance to infect the rest of the world.   To be completely honest though, I disagree that Plague Inc is worth fifteen dollars. X-COM: Enemy Unknown is thirty dollars, which would imply that Planue Inc thinks itself at least half as good as X-COM. It's not. Command and Conquer Generals Deluxe Edition cost $20 at launch. Plague Inc is certainly not almost as good as CnC:Generals either. It's an interesting game, I like it, but it's not worth fifteen dollars. I'd say a reasonable price for this game is five dollars or less, not fifteen. I recommend Plague Inc, but not at the current price. Wait for a sale.",

The best part of Plague Inc. is that the user can name their disease anything they want and upgrade it to kill humanity before they complete the cure. Something about having Bananas infect thousands and kill more than the black death brings fun and humour into the game. So here are the things to look forward to while playing this game:  - Difficulty levels are very accurate and include Casual, Normal, Brutal, and Mega Brutal - Each plague has special abilities/characteristics which add variety - Genes are unlocked after winning, allowing you to customize your disease for the next game - Start your plague wherever you want and upgrade transmission/symptoms/abilities to your style of play. This leads to having no set way of winning / lots of variety - Straightforward game, but randomly upgrading will NOT win you the game, therefore requiring some skill - You can unlock cheats making the game pretty funny - Many game modes - Very few glitches (sometimes manually saving game freezes) - FAST FORWARD X2 AND X3!!!!!! My favourite feature :) - After the game you can check your disease stats/cure stats and see a replay of your game  Cons - You will hate Greenland after this game. Every time you look at a map of the world you will look at Greenland and naturally become enraged. This is only normal. -Also the games take what seems like a long time so don't expect a quick run.  Overall I give it a 8/10 as this game provides endless hours of fun, thinking, and stress relief. Great game and I strongly recommend it!",

A few improvements and things I suggest you add:  1) A few new viruses:  a) Vector Virus  This is a virus that can change the DNA and RNA of people. Added scenarios, more options, and a world population counter that changes using a simulated world population chart that rises and falls to current events.   b) 'Cure'  The cure option is available to those who have mastered more than 25 custom scenarios. This will get them the option of a 'cure setting' on the plauge singleplayer menu, after the Vector Virus. They can then choose which virus type to cure, and then a randomizer will select an online scenario. You will play as the cure, and will have different traits and options of extra genes than you normally get. If you win on every cure mode, from bacteria to vector virus, you'll get another achievement, called 'Cure Complete,' and that will also unlock a multiplayer cure mode. In the end it will all pay off.   2) Some new features!  a) Gene Splicing  You can decide wether or not to combine diseases. You'll get two rows of traits now, and the option of double genes. That would be fun for someone who has unlocked all of the plauges.   b) New Custom Protest Effect  Protests for the disease can now occur randomly, forcing cure to speed up for some time, or start the cure. This only happens if the world has noticed this disease and is very severe and/or lethal.   That's all I've got. That would be sooo cool if you added those.

In this still developed game, go for one of 10+ pathogens with own Background stats ad mostly even abilities to either eradicate the world or take control over it. Sounds easy, doesn't it? Well: if you started in Arabia, don't expect your sickness to be effective in Russia, or even reach to Canada, since it might be neither used to cold or long travelling via boat or plane... let's help that and evolve! if only those pesky humans would not want to get rid of you again, doing research in the background... will be a race against time, for both, i guess...  Additionally, there are scenarios to spice things up, changing start effects like global wealth, making all countries have access to antibiotics and good healthcare, havin a new iceage etc. . Also, the Scenario-creator helps greatly that you won't run out on supplies ;)  Only multiplayer is not working so far, and no reference was done so far.  My verdict: it can be much fun to experiment on different difficulties and pathogens, sadly on some parts the pathogens still are congruent to a high level (Virus, bacteria, Fungus, so to speak the first 5) except their special abilities, so you might find your working way on infecting the world and might hardly change that, which can become a little boring. On the other hand: no one duresses you to always start in the same country and with the same Evolutions... so it's up to you.",

Basically, lay low with asymptomatic infection, then once the entire world is infected, go super lethal.  I find fungi make it harder to do this though, because you need to spend extra points helping your fungus spread to distant nations. Basically you need to budget your points more and can't rely on having the points at the end to both infect those last stubbornly remote places (Greenland, Iceland and New Zealand I'm looking at you) and slow the world's efforts to find a cure.  So yeah if you were like me, tried bacteria &amp; virus and said 'meh, is that all?' the new disease types both increase game difficulty and open new win conditions as well.

I truly enjoy it. More recently I've been grinding out achievements because I enjoy doing so on many different games, and have completely been loving the game. There are a few very, very minor bugs that occur within the menus, but I just have to go to the main menu or go back one page usually to fix it. So the game is basically flawless.
