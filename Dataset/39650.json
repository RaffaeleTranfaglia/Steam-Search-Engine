            "review_text": "Don't let the Metascore fool you, this game plays better than its rating. This game is great for those who enjoy business and life sims, plus it's in the medieval times. I became addicted to this game because of its political mechanics, and how you rival other dynasties through out time (Through business trade, political regard, and even combat). I have played too many hours on the Guild 2 and the others in the bundle, and I'm always finding out new ways to do things. Does it have bugs? Yes. Is it pretty behind in terms of graphics? Yes. But to me, it's a really good game that I can spend 10 hours on in a row and not get tired of it. If you feel iffy about the game, then just get it when it's on sale. However, I highly recommend this game and The Guild 2: Renaissance and would say they are worth their standard price.",

While it has a steep learning curve, this game is truly a gem of a sim/rpg. My only suggestion is PLAY THE TUTORIAL. This game was almost impossible to figure out on my own, but after playing the tutorial the game got a whole heck of a lot more fun.  Basically, choose to start your family dynasty with a selection from several classes including: Craftsman, Patron, Scholar, and Rogue. Once you get started you can start a business, hire employees, improve your buildings, buy titles for yourself, woo a lady (or man), have children, send them off to school (or dont), commit crimes, bribe city officials, blackmail people, smoothtalk your way out of a court sentencing, smoothtalk your way into a public office.... Just way too much to even try to list. There is so much to do in this game. It has already eaten over 10 hours of my life and it's about to gobble up another 4 or 5 tonight.",

Essentially, the game allows the player to use a bunch of maneuvres and tactics to climb the social ladder. If you like games that reward you for playing strategically, than this is for you. It's a deep and intricate game that gives you the freedom to do what you want. However, don't expect it to be easy or lightweight, it requires patience and concentration. The game however has a few bugs which will probably not be patched since the game is pretty old and a new installment will be coming out in the near future. Despite this it's still playable and enjoyable for an old game.",

It jus lacks some features that are in the standalone exapansion 'The Guild 2 : Renaissance'. Don't ask me why it's a standalone I don't know neither !

Guild 2 had the potential to be something really amazing.   Pros: The artwork on the towns and maps is well done despite the limitations of the graphics capabilities. The gameplay is innovative and provides a lot of varied options including building wealth by running your day to day business operations and expansion, getting involved in politics and the accompanying intrigue, sabotaging competitors, and building a family.  Cons: The pathing AI is horrendous. Much of your time will be eaten away hoping that your toon can find their way home or to town hall. Speaking of time killers, as you get into politics, the meetings get longer and longer. They end up easily taking up half the game play time. So, it ends up being mandatory to set up AI control of your businesses. You will probably want to anyway after the first few interactions with managing your business on your own because it quickly goes from interesting to tedious.  I put in almost 4 hours and desperately wanted to love the game. Also tried the Pirate expansion in the hopes it would fix some of the issues. Eventually it became too annoying to enjoy.  This could have been something awesome with better design. But no.",

            "review_text": "After watching the 'Let's play the game' about The Guild 2, I decided to buy the game and try it out. The first thing you'll find out, that's it's quite unclear what you should do. The tutorials give you the basics about control and actions you can take. But anything worthwhile is player made and quality varies.   You have the different 'classes' you can try: - Patron - Craftsman - Scholars - Rouges  I chose craftsman and started a blacksmith making tools. Bought wood and iron and all went quite well.  After a while I bought a woodcutter, which helped in making more money. In the meantime I went on adventure in the political arena and made it to some low-ranking office. Got some kids, expanded my buildings a little.  After a while you get how the game works and all goes more easily. Instead of buying an already existing mine, which was getting more and more expensive, I instead send my thugs to attack and conquer it. After which, my wealth exploded. Because the mine was making much more then it was selling and wasn't controlled by one of the houses.  Expanding my little empire, I ran into the rank problem which required you to buy an higher title to build more buildings. And decided to build stuff in another town. Meanwhile I had reached the highest political rank, with two children on the two 2nd tier positions. Making it easy as pie to stay in position and also to quel my oponents. And everybody was bribing me to get any position, which was a nice income as well.  But at this point, the game lost my interest. There was little challenge left and only 'chores' that remained. The scope of the game doesn't magically increase. The city and villages around it are you playground, forever. Which means once you got enough buildings and such, you basically won. No endless games.  You can make the AI 'run' your buildings, which is nice and all that, but mostly poorly worked out. 1) You cannot setup 'routes' like 'Bring XX wood from woodcutter to blacksmith, then bring XX iron from mine to blacksmith' 2) The AI buys the resources needed, not necessarily at your resource-producer 3) You cannot set your building to sell only to -your- carts, thus you cannot set a lower price for yourself 4) The AI ignores your 'only work in current city' setting from time to time  Besides that there are various annoying buys: 1) Translations in dialogues are missing or buggy. Resulting in German speech. 2) Carts standing next to a building (or in it) don't show up for interaction in the building 3) Various other glitches  All these combined result in my regretting buying the game. It was fun for a maximum of 9 hours, but after writing this review and deleting the game. I highly doubt I ever will touch the game again.",
