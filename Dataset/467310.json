            "review_text": "P.S: I play this offline so that's not the exact in-game time  So I saw this game when exploring the store and my first impression was 'THIS IS SO EARTHBOUND!!!' and I bought it in a doubt that it will be good.  But then my second impression after playing the game was 'THIS IS REALLY A PIECE OF ROUGH GEM', I don't imagine a game with this price would be this good. I love exploring the map and dungeons while looking for treasures. I love those portals that leads to unknown places. Right now I just saved my first friend and there are 2 friends to go and lots of side quests to go.   PROS: - It's 16 bit! So retro - Day and night system - Nice music - Lots of quests - Lots to explore - Veggie Gardening  CONS:  - But well there are things that kinda annoy me until now, like the item numbers are stacked so it's kinda unreadable. - Plain looking opening and menu - A bit repetitive, leveling.  8.5 / 10 - Will verbally abused again by the police  Thank you for your hardwork developer-san!",
