    "description": "This game is a decision based simulation placing you in the shoes of somebody in a crisis situation. Unlike some games, your decisions have a serious impact on the story and the events that follow. It is meant to resemble real time meaning that a no decision counts as an action, and can result in lost time or negative consequences.",
