            "review_text": "Sit your lily ♥♥♥ down because I'm about to tell you the story about one of the greatest IP's in gaming history.  Shantae originally came out on Game Boy Color in 2001. If you're a normal person, you didn't know this until just now. Even though it didn't sell very well, it was critically acclaimed and in fact, often ranks high in lists of the best GBC games. Aside from just being an absolute blast, it pushed the technocological barriers of the GBC to the max, creating the nicest looking game on the system, hands down.  And then they made a second one.  Capcom, deciding that Shantae wouldn't sell to the masses (but when has Capcom been right?), decided NOT to publish the sequel, known as Shantae Advance. Skip forward six years, and Wayforward finally manages to publish their own game for the 3DS, but this beauty right here didn't come out until 2010.  So what is Shantae: Risky's Revenge? The best ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ platformer on this planet, that's what (at least until Pirate's Curse and Half-Genie Hero comes out). It takes place shortly after the original Shantae, pitting the eponymous half-genie belly dancer against her rival, Risky Boots, the sexy pirate. I won't ruin the story, because it seems elementary at most, but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ does the game play great.  The graphics are reminiscent of a SNES game, but plays much more smoothly. It's an art style that some will undoubtedly hate, but that's the way it is. The music. Jesus Christ of Al Qaeda, I could write an entire novel on why Jake Kaufman is one of the most underrated composers of all time. The songs sound great and add to the atmosphere of the game (just sit down for a while in Tangle Forest, you won't regret it), and many of the most famous tunes from the original Shantae were remastered for this game too (such as Burning Town and the boss theme). The gameplay is your standard platformer: jump and attack. You also have the option to equip magic spells and backdash (sounds a bit like Symphony of the Night, eh?) Additionally, Shantae learns a few dances throughout her journey that allow her to turn into animals such as a monkey and elephant that are needed to progress.  The world is colorful and brimming with life, which reflects well on all the other characters (even Risky Boots herself pops out and has a vibrant personality). The game follows the concept of Metroidvania, which means you can roam freely around a 2D world, but can't access specific areas without finding certain objects first. Luckily, the game does a good job of hinting at where you should go so we don't feel like we're being dragged along. The characters are unique, and along with an excellent script, display their own personalities and mannerisms. The script isn't too indepth or intricate, but it's enough to give the characters their own sense of uniqueness (Abner Cadaver's a damn good example).  There are two complains though. Two major flaws that strike early on: the control layout, and the map.  Honestly, it is a ♥♥♥♥ing miracle I survived the tutorial battle. You're not given any prompts on how to attack, which wouldn't be a problem with a controller, but a keyboard has a ♥♥♥♥♥on of keys. My only advice is to go the options beforehand and change most, if not, all the pre-existing keys. After a few minutes of tinker(bats)ing, I managed to find a layout that wouldn't make my hand cramp after a few minutes of playing.   The map is the spawn of Satan. What the ♥♥♥♥ was Wayforward thinking when they designed it. I've been playing this game for (at the current time of the review) 6 hours, and I cannot figure out which way I am supposed to be looking at it. It's difficult to explain, but once you see a picture of the map, you'll understand the reason it sucks.  Overall, 10/10, would ♥♥♥♥ Shantae",

Even we don't get the original sequel to Shantae for the GBA due to GBA's life span expired and no particular publisher like their first game (published by Capcom), WayForward decided to cancel it, the second attempt to make a sequel to the Shantae series for the DS and also failed. Now for the 3rd attempt to make a sequel and I was successful thanks the loyal fans of Shantae.   First it was digitally downloadable for the DSWare in 2009, and then ported to the 3DS and the Wii U, and now the Steam fans themselves will get a chance to play this game.   the sad part about is that I played through the game through the keyboard and not the controller, but I manage to play it through the game and it was great!   I wanna give WayForward alot of props of making this game and it's highly recommendable. Not go to any details, I say check it out! This sequel made it's 3rd attempt and it's a charm! now if you excuse me, I will play some Shantae and the Pirate's Curse! Keep it up, WayForward!",

            "review_text": "Let me start off by saying, I was very skeptical of purchasing this game at first. The reason? I had played the original Shantae on the Gameboy Color when I was younger and wasn't too big a fan of it, however I pushed on and tried out this game and I honestly have no regrets with my purchase at all. This game felt like an honest masterpiece to me and I enjoyed playing through the game multiple times. It has a great design with the sprites and art work, great music, great storyline and characters. Was just interesting to me overall and felt pretty close to a Metroid type game, which I love seeing as I've been a Metroid nerd ever since I was younger (Metroid Prime 4 and Super Metroid HD pls.) Anyways, besides that, let's get into it!  The developers did a very great job on this game, even consider it one of my favorites. They kept the simple, yet fun of old school platforming games, kept the music pretty close, kept the sprites pretty close and the game in general. They have some interesting wordplay and character development in the story that gives some of the characters their own unique personality as you go along with it. As I stated above and other have stated, keeps a very close resemblance to Metroid, Zelda, Castlevania type games. With there being collectibles and power ups to collect throughout the game, some of which you can get from the start, with the rest being able to collect as you continue on with the game and get more special abilities. Ways to increase life, items to heal health and restore magic and save rooms and certain parts of the world. There is even a different costume when you beat the game, which in a way changes your playstyle as now you take more damage, but use less magic, so where you might be able to sit around and take a few hits, now become a risk, and I love that they made that type of challenge to the game.  Gameplay wise is a little on the short side, about 4, maybe 5 hours worth, however, it's a story that is great, regardless of it's time. You can take it slow or speed run the game, which again, am a great fan of games that offer the option to speed run without affecting the game too much.  The controls are pretty easy to get used to, can even use a controller if you wish to play with that. They didn't feel sluggish, clumpy or anything to me, instead felt pretty smooth after I was use to everything. One quick tip that a lot of people have seemed to ask, if you want this in fullscreen, go to options, set the resolution to your monitor size, then press ALT+Enter to keep it true fullscreen.  One thing I liked in particular was how as you progress through the game, enemies from their 'natural area' will start to move more closer to the lands surrounding Scuttle Town, was a pretty neat idea in my opinion, making things have a smaller challenge with their being newer enemies on the paths that you normally would just breeze right past no problem.  The bosses and their dungeons were pretty interesting, with them ranging from time trials, to puzzles to solve, all were very well executed in how they were played out with. The boss fights alone, are pretty good as well. Some of them you have to take somewhat slow so you don't rush head on and risk getting hit, where as some you can just full out attack and dodge when it's needed.  The characters are some of those characters that you 'grow' a little with through your adventure, from getting closer to them, to knowing what they're about, some secrets, and a few other things you will see while playing through it.  -Shantae: Can be a little arrogant at times, yet as you continue on with the game, she learns that she will need help down the road and not to push such things away  -Risky Boots: sarcastic, taunting, antagonist who is always causing trouble in the story, still keeps up her taunting even if things don't go her way.  -Sky: At first looks, seems to be a little hard headed alongside Shantae, but then it's noticeable that she's just trying to help out however she can.  -Mimic: (for some reason, he reminded me of Lord Crump from Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door.) Uncle of Shantae who is a Relic Hunter, who knows a few things which he apparently keeps a secret from you until it's basically forced from him.  -Rottytops: Taunting friend of Shantae who helps you along the way while still seeming like an enemy (I mean, she took a puppy and offered it to you to eat...)  There's more you'll meet along the way as you continue on through the story.  All in all, I'm very satisfied with my purchase, even if I was a little off putting from the start, due to me not being a huge fan of the original Shantae I had played on the Gameboy Color, but I'm glad I went ahead and bought the game. It's a game I very much enjoy and soon a series I think I'll continue to enjoy and stick around with for a while, seeing as there are two new games coming out, one for 3DS and Wii U (hopefully PC down the road) and another one coming out on all systems and PC. I look forward to playing both new games, glad the community is so supporting with the developers making their new games, seeing as they raised a lot with their kickstarter and I truly can't wait to try out their next game, seeing where the story takes off after Risky's Revenge!   10/10 Highly recommend giving it a shot!",

            "review_text": "Shantae: Risky's Revenge is a platforming, metroidvania style game. It's the sequal to the original Shantae for the Game Boy Color in 2002, and was originally released on the Nintendo DSi in 2010. It's also on the Apple App Store.  The game follows Shantae, a half-genie with belly dancing powers and hair whipping. She has to stop Risky Boots from taking over her home of Scuttle Town by finding magical seals that Risky is after. It's a simple story, dialogue is few and far between, but it still has charming characters, and Shantae herself is a really nice character, being fierce and always on point. The world has lots of nice looking locations, and really captivates me with it's art style. The music blends it in well, despite being on the DS, originally.  The gameplay feels much like an old SNES game, it's pure platforming and exploring to it's core, beginning to end. And that's something that really pleases me: It's incredibly simple, there's not even that big a world to explore, but it still manages to be expansive and really rewards exploration in it's own way. There's lots of hidden goodies and upgrades for the daring explorer, and solving puzzles in dugeons always feel like a good time, testing both your platforming, and puzzle solving skills. The two mains components is what the game has, and excecutes it fabulously, it feels rewarding.  Shantae's main weapon is her hair (Which can be upgraded), but she can also use magical powers she can purchase from the item shop, which requires both gems and magic jam, which are more rare. These powers can be orbiting spikes around her, lightning clouds, or fireballs. There's a power for every kind of situation when hair whipping just won't do. All these powers can be upgraded as well.  If that wasn't enough, Shantae, being a belly-dancer as well, can transform into different animals with her dances, whether that's a monkey, elephant, or otherwise. There's also upgrades to those transformations that let's you backtrack to previous areas, and discover more hidden items. This also let's you fight and platform in more ways than one, if you so desire.  There's a 'Magic Mode' which gives Shantae a new outfit that makes her magical items more effective, but she takes double the damage from enemies. Think of it as a 'Hard mode' if the game was too easy for you the first time around.  There are some issues with this game though, but keep in mind they're relatively minor.   - PC wise, this is a port of a digital DSi downloaded game, so the game won't look it's best on a big monitor, may look pretty pixilated. Also, it's not widescreen supported with black bars showing up at higher resolutions, and it doesn't appear to really go into full screen. (For me, at least. It still appears windowed.)  - With most metroidvania games, there is backtracking, and going from one place to another can get a little annoying when you're just trying to get from one place to another. Luckily there's these warp stones that lessen the traveling time.  - It's relatively short, clocking in about 3-4 hours for one playthrough. But considering this was a portable, digital game to start off with, I understand that.  Overall, Shantae is a fantastic game that you really should try out. It's a simplistic game that has excecuted it's few elements very nicely, and I think you'll be surprised.",

Leading to me enjoying the start of the game a lot less, as well as parts of the rest. If you play windowed and/or with a keyboard, skip this part.  1) Game not fullscreening properly. I spent 10 minutes trying to get the options to work out because, by all means, it should have been working. Gave up and looked for a fix on the forums. Turns out pressing ''alt + enter'' just once while the game is open is a permanent fix. Why this hasn't been fixed yet, or is mentioned nowhere in a sticky or something is beyond me.  2) The most annoying thing, because it can't easily be fixed, is that for some reason they preset A to jump and CANCEL while B is Talk/Accept (for Xbox 360 controller). THIS CANNOT BE REBOUND. You cannot give keys a double function yourself. It's preset Jump/Cancel on A, or seperate button for cancel/jump. I can't stress enough how weird it is to have those two basic keys swapped. People used to the common ''A for accept, B for cancel'' will be pressing the wrong one a lot. Note that the devs are apparently aware of this (looking at a forum post on March 12th), so this could see a fix soon. I soldiered on but if you're bothered by this one, it may be best to switch to keyboard until the fix is in.  Now, on to the actual game, which I'll keep fairly short.  Positives:   - Great art. Backgrounds/Character Cutouts/Sprites/... . - Quirky story/dialogue. Not too serious, lots of funny quips. - Music is ok. Not too memorable but never annoying in either of my 2 playthroughs. Just there as decent background tunes. - Spells are fun. - Transformation dances are even better. Very fun to play around with. - Platforming is solid for the most part.  Negatives:  - Relatively linear for most parts which gets somewhat dropped during other parts (trying to figure out which of the caves holds the next powerup). May feel a bit disjointed. (''What do you mean I can't progress here yet?''). - Fairly short game. My first run took 5 hours and I'm really, really good at still getting lost or taking my sweet time. - Hitboxes can be a bit wonky (don't try jumping over enemies that are not going towards you). - Spells are a bit unbalanced. Spike ball and upgrades are just too useful to not have activated 24/7, so to speak. The 2 others just take too long or are too wasteful. - Bosses could really use a health bar. You never really know how far down they are since they don't really change their attack patterns much.   Overal, I'd still recommend picking it up (on sale or not). It's got its issues, but it's an okay game if you're looking for some not too serious, fairly short, metroidvania style action.",

It boasts a female-protagonist, a metroidvania style gameplay, and a straight-forward and not over-complicated storyline.  This kind of game somehow found me the perfect fit for story-telling for my taste, this game continues right where the last left-off, yet doesn't flesh out the story too much to a point where it may become easily confused.  At face-value, some may be concerned that the female protagonist may be weak, and cave-in to the comment or authority from a man (or anyone as a matter of fact), as games sometimes portray women as. This is not the case for Shantae; she is very strong and she follows what she thinks is right and doesn't throw her moral views away when she is told to throw it away, she fights for the lives of people, and is willing to make decisions that will ultimately hurt her, but save others from pain.  Now to the sound. For a side-scrolling pixel game, the sound is very good, not to mention the music. Jake Kaufman, a fairly popular composer of music, did a great job with the soundtrack. Each soundtrack fits almost perfectly with the setting, and most of the soundtracks make you want to dance to the beat (like Shantae).  Regarding my 'side-scrolling pixel game' comment, if you play the game or have watched gameplay of this game, you will notice that there are pads that let you jump from one layer of the area to another. This is a crucial feature in this game because it allows you to explore and immerse yourself into each area (basically making the area feel 3D and not just a plane).  The pros out-weigh the cons in this game, let me tell you that we are very lucky to have a game like this be created with such polish and care, and that personally, I may never be able repay the creators (and Shantae) with the amount of joy this has given me.",

For the sake of simplicity I'll be referring to the game as Shantae from here on out.   Shantae is a 2D platformer port. There aren't a lot of bells and whistles and the entire game can be completed in under 5 hours on a blind playthrough. There is replay value due to 'Magic Mode' (Which decreases your defense in exchange for decreased magic consumption and an even skimpier alternate costume)   The game is fun and easy to pick up. Controls are fluid and Shantae herself is well animated, making the entire game feel 'Smooth'. Transformation (one of the games key mechanics) is easily performed and swapped out of with no need for menues or anything like that. Item selection, however does involve menus. The DS version lacked this problem due to the menu being on the lower screen.   Difficulty is low. Enemies are easy to deal with for the most part (I hate you, Mermaids and Archers), and bosses follow patterns that can be figured out fairly easily. You have a variety of magic spells and the ability to store up to 9 potions for both health and magic. These completely refill your meter no matter how low you are.   The story is entertaining, though simple. Characters are bright and colorful and have personalities that make them stand out from eachother - even NPCs without portratis have plenty of fun and interesting things to say. There are plenty of collectibles and options for completing the game (It's a great candidate for speed runs btw, and achievements actually reward this. A second playthrough is inevitable if you want to go for the speedy route.) The game can easily be beaten in under 3 hours if you know what you're doing. Some runners have times less than 2.   The game does feature plenty of skin on display, huge cleavage and skimpy clothing are the norm for ALL female characters and there's some 'Monster Girl' nudity. So if you have issues with sexual overtones in character design you've been warned.   Overall it's a fun and cheap 2D platforming experience. Though a bit too short and easy for most these days.   I give Shantae: Risky's Revenge Director's Cut a 7/10.",

Only negative I can find with this is that the game is pretty short as I managed to beat it in just over 6 hours, but for the price, it's good value nonetheless.  If you're a fan of this series or you like action/adventure/metroidvania games, then by all means pick this up immediately!

It's the sequel of Shantae (Gameboy Colour, 2002) and takes place in the same location, even though the map is significantly smaller in comparison and there are only 3 dungeons instead of 4 in the prequel. The story is basically the same as the first game,the Risky 'Queen of the seven seas' Boots is doing bad things and you (Shantae) has to kick her perfect round pirate booty because nobody else will. I hope you like bellydancing too.  However, graphical quality has increased greatly, the smooth pixel art and sprite animations are in overall a joy to look at, same thing for the music.  I guess we can say that this cute and charming platformer belongs in the Metroidvania genre, due to all of the locations that can be visited over and over to find new collectibles/money/gear/etc...  Pros: -Tight gameplay (though maybe a little easy sometimes) -Nice visuals and music -Good looking pixel art -Decent level desing in the overworld and good level desings in the dungeons -A good challenge for speedrunners -Bellydancing -Pixel b00bies  Cons: -Sometimes traveling can become quite dull -Some people have issues with this port, some minor, some greater, but the ports doesn't work 100% fine in every PC -WHERE THE HELL DO I FIND A MAGIC JAM NOW?!?!  TL;DR version: Like Metroidvanias and/or platformers? Try this game.",

I've only tried the very beginning on the steam version yet and don't know the differences with the original but I can tell that in the beginning of the original there was a particular originality is how the background is designed that makes you walk on slight slopes and a little bit confusing about where to go because of how you go back and forth behind or in front. But it was precisely something I found totally original and very enjoyable actually. In this game there's a system of foreground and background zone that uses special spots to jump back and forth. I Love both the version I tried on gameboy color emulator and this one which has veeeery cute pleasing graphics and both are a pleasure for the eyes and the gameplay. Wonderful world Full of colors and cuteness, detailed animations that are giving life to this game, belly dancing resulting in multiple special tranformations. It'ss definitly entertaining.",

While the story is rather lacking and basic, for a kid's Metroidvania platformer, does it really matter?  This game is beautiful. The pixel graphics are bright and colorful, and the animations are smooth and fluid (and sickeningly cute, just crouch in game and you'll see what I mean). Level backgrounds are very diverse and detailed, while at the same time staying consistent, ensuring the characters/enemies don't feel out-of place or pasted-in.  This game plays at par on most every level. Controls are very generic and fit the simple platformer mold. One aspect that sets S:RRDC apart is the 'layered' 2D style of the overworld. What I mean is that the overworld has segments of 2D sidescrolling overlapping and layered in different planes. Certain panels allow you to transfer between these planes, allowing the world to be expansive while keeping it compact and condensed. Not many games adopt this mechanic. The difficulty tends to shift eratically over the course of the game, and for every little part I had trouble with, the next hour of play was a breeze.  Colorful environments and cutesy characters aside, I'm sure it was more than a coincidence that Shantae herself is the embodiment of 'Innocent Fanservice Girl'.",

This game really brought me back to my days playing super Mario world, super adventure island and other such games that got me into the hobby of playing games in the first place. The controls are tight as a drum and I never once doubted where I was going to land. Shantae is floaty enough to make jumping easy while not being so floaty that you miss your jump entirely. Playing this with an xbox controller felt natural (except for A and B being switched in the menus) and the controls just work as they should. The game has many areas to explore with vastly different sceneries to take in. however this brings me to my first gripe about the game. This game happens to suffer from the where the f*** do I go now syndrome. The map is almost completely useless and when you do find where to go you have to back track to get that one item you missed so you can progress. I several times spent too much time going the wrong direction because the game wasn't clear. There is a hint system to help alleviate this however its vague at best. I will forgive this to some degree as this is just how the genre of metroidvainia is. The only other gripe I have is that this game WAS not made for a 27 inch HD monitor as the game just looks stretched out however again I can again forgive this due to it being originally on the DSI and I did get used to how it looked and actually preferred it as again it brought me back to those old NES and SNES days. The story is nothing to be awe inspired by however it is written well and there's some witty lines in the dialogue that in one instance I think broke the 4th wall somewhat. Overall if I had to give this game a score out of 10 I would give it a 9.

How many minutes are required before you say to yourself “Well, that was ten bucks wasted, thanks for nothing Steam’s Refund Policy.”  For me and Shantae: Risky’s Revenge the answer is “about an hour.”  I’ve always wanted to play a Shantae game. The moment I saw the first one I thought it looked amazing. And it does, it totally does. The graphics, by Henk Nieborg, are lush and gorgeous and detailed in ways that few other pixel artists can approach. It’s a very beautiful game.  But these graphics hide a horrible secret: the simple, tragic truth is that the guys responsible for creating the game itself had nothing to say. They had no interesting ideas, and based on the dumbass errors they made along the way, I don’t think they’ve been paying attention to games for at least a decade, possibly since 16 bits was a lot.  I don’t like the level design. Long horizontal strips with jump pads for moving into and out of the screen must have been amazing on the 3DS, but here it's just a lot of parallax that serves only to create confusing, maze-like levels. And at the edges of these horizontal strips are, sometimes, exits to the next horizontal strip. There's no visible indicator, so you have to walk all the way to the end to see if you can go through it or not. And if you're not paying very close attention, you'll walk all the way over there again and again as the similar-looking strips start to blur together and you just want to find the freaking exit and get on with it.  When the levels aren't annoyingly 3D they're almost totally linear, and somehow even this is annoying. There are destructible blocks that look the same as indestructible blocks, except that the ones you can destroy are between you and the next place you need to go. If it's not between you and something else, it's probably not something you can clear away. There's no way to tell until you try, of course, the game hates you.  There are a lot of level elements that look like they should be platforms but they’re not, or they’re part of the level behind the one you’re on. It’s not at all obvious where you can and can’t go. A platform game that can’t make this clear has suffered a critical failure very early.  The game just isn’t fun. Shantae’s attacks take just that split second too long, and there’s a separate button for clearing a dialogue box instead of just using one of the existing buttons like every other game ever and I just can’t get used to it.  It feels like the best artists in the world got together with talented designers and made amazing things but then, when it came to making a game that made sense, that was tight and fun and exciting and new, they just had nothing to say. They had run dry, they weren’t the guys who knew how to game, they were artists, the best of the best, and that’s just not enough.  Looks great though.",
