            "review_text": "This is an extremely fun game. I found it challenging and intriguing, with loads of ways to complete levels, tons of strategies to employ, and the easiest level editor to use that I've ever seen.  The game takes tower defense to a new level, because not only do you have to kill enemies by shooting them or destroying them, you have a second method after playing the game for an hour or two, where you can shove enemies off ledges and insta-kill them, spring them, etc. It opens up whole new ways of destroying your foes.  If I had to classify this game with anything else, I'd put it on par with Orcs Must Die. Easily a 9/10 tower defense for me. And it has steam workshop, play it now! I bought it at full price, and if you see it on sale it's DEFINITELY worth the purchase!",

Pros: Its fun, not punishing if you've put the wrong upgrade, there's a reset button, multiplier exp for each stage, a lot of stuff to upgrade. From the first 42 minute i played, i have played only 3 stages yet i repeat it until i got perfect score, it's going to be a very long journey ahead for me  Cons: Crappy graphics, at first i thought i havent set the right resolution, after checking the setting, it just very pixelated, i hope its going to be like defender quest    where the dev is very awesome to upgrade the graphic after a couple of YEARS. but the fun make it up for me.  All in all, if you can't buy a freakin skyrim because that bull ♥♥♥♥ discount got cut off for releasing the new upgrade next october or factorio that will never goes on discount ever, you can buy this game instead which an awesome game!",

            "review_text": "The music gets old fast and the game balance is all over the place.  You can't see all the waves at the start so you can't choose an appropriate loadout for half the maps without having played through most of it already and unavoidably lost.  The traps become available as you complete maps yet unlike any other tower defense the availability is almost directly proportional to how far you are through the game. I got really tired of not having all the tools I wanted for any given map.  Also there's a lot of random chance involved in trap behavior and enemy movement. Maybe your pusher trap will catch a whole lot of enemies, or maybe it will only push one! Even if you set things up to clump up enemies the pusher will sometimes just fail to work properly or miss some of the clump. There's serious reliability issues, which makes the fast-moving enemies that ignore demons (one of the best ways to control enemy movement) MAJOR problems, even if you plan for them. You basically just have to hope that the setup you have is enough for whatever the level throws at you.  I don't like having to HOPE. I want to be able to PLAN.  Edit: okay, now you can see what all the units in each wave are by scrolling the waves. Yet that doesn't solve some of the most irritating problems with this game: MASS UNITS. The game loves to throw like 50 of one type at you, and if your setup isn't specifically made to deal with that and actually WORKS to deal with that, you're screwed. There are just too many enemy units that require specific traps to deal with, especially with runes enabled.",
