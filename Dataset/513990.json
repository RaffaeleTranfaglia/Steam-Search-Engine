Trees kept disappearing and reappearing on me, and in one level I couldn't tell how many workers I had available because one was still standing in place while his doppelgangers ran around. The game lets you queue tasks sometimes, but doesn't always mark what's queued. I gave up after I accidentally clicked on the same task twice, the game sent two workers to do it, and one of them got permanently stuck building the farm (or rather, banging his hammer on the farmer's head, because that's what the animation actually looks like). There are plenty of more technically sound time management games on Steam that you could play instead of this.",
