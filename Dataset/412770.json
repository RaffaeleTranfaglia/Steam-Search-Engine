            "review_text": "For starters, let me clarify something: this game has nothing to do with that atrocious slasher film titled Boogeyman. Neither does it have anything to do with its sequels. Boogeyman is about the very mythical creature that parents use to make their children go bed in time or simply behave properly. I think the adaptation of such a thing is a very clever idea.  Many people compared this to the series called Five Nights At Freddy's. The concept is similar: we are positioned at a specific place - we cannot move just look around in Thomas' room. Mentioned boy is equipped with a flashlight, the sole weapon that is capable of ridding ourselves of the boogeyman. The mission is very simple: survive till 6 o'clock in the morning. We have to survive 6 hours on our bed while the creature can enter our room through the window, the vent, come out of the cupboard or from under the bed and can even use the door from the corridor to peek in.   The game uses a handful of distractions. While we can manage ourselves pretty soon we realise it's not just about the surveillance but also about paying attention to various noises the boogeyman makes. Did he just make a scratching sound? He's coming from under our bed. Do you hear him breathing? He will not come out but you are not to take a look at underneath you.  And this is what I like about the game: it forces you to look under the bed. The very place with batteries to charge your flashlight. It is the challenging part as you definitely get some important seconds lost while going down there which is a must. Early on you find the game easy but come Night 4 and you are in for a world of hurt! Overall, 7 nights are to be completed and I have to say I enjoyed the ride.   Back to distractions: the game employs some weather effects to play with your senses. While the lightning can help you see the room for a sec or two the constant sound of the heavy rain may suppress the boogie's noises. There are a couple of lights turned on but sooner or later all are switched off and we barely have any lighting sources. I like how the toys can be turned on out of the blue making us drive up the wall. The cymbal-banging monkey toy in the corner just behind us looks as if he just arrived from a Stephen King novel.  The game has an additional, free-roaming, house exploration mode but that I did not like. I did not find it as terrifying as the original concept. Moreover I cannot comment on the VR option. A propos VR: the floating menus are certainly an improvement compared to the ones in the older versions but it does not pause the game itself - it is pretty annoying to start over because I had the idea of changing something in the video settings.  Some more gameplay modes and added difficulty levels would be great additions. Also, the death animation is pretty annoying as in case a 2nd or 3rd boogeyman enters the room while the animation is being played it is followed up by theirs. This repetition of monster pop-up and an ugly red screen could certainly use some improvement.  Boogeyman is a refreshing concept in a genre that has seen some great games in recent years such as Slenderman or Outlast. It can certainly stand on its own but I recommend the developer make some improvements here and there to fully utilise this great idea.",

            "review_text": "Firstly, a disclaimer: No, no, and finally NO, I have not yet played Five Nights at Freddy's 4. But I'm well aware that there may be certain strong similarities between that particular game and this one. I have, in any case, played the first three FNAF games, and can thereby make comparisons to those.    I'm relieved to report that this is probably the best FNAF 'homage' that I've played thus far. Have I played them all? Again...NO. I play a lot of horror games, and not all of them have to resemble an ever-so-mildly 'ground-breaking' title from as far back in the annals of human history as the year 2014. But I have played a few Freddy 'rip-offs', and this is probably the best. Well, okay...the best which features a first-person perspective, like Freddy's. Go To Bed: Survive The Night is probably on a par with this. But it doesn't look like this. But it is set in a bedroom, where you have to keep beasties at bay, sometimes using light and...    Oh Lord, do you see how difficult this is getting? This is because I know what a bunch of tribal ferals the FNAF fans are. Self-righteous little turds who think that because something got released while they were just growing their first pubic hairs, it's the most revolutionary thing to come down the turnpike since SLICED ♥♥♥♥ING BREAD. Every generation does it, I'm sure. I'm sure MY generation did it. Hell, a fair proportion of MY generation thought that we invented rock 'n' roll (it was actually called 'grunge', and contrary to some reports, WASN'T actually the first time in recorded human history that someone had plugged in a guitar and screamed over the top of it). So anyway, can I get on with my review now? Now that I've acknowledged that, yes, I'm aware of a series that this game takes some, ahem, 'inspiration' from?! A series which is barely over a year old as I type these words?!? Good. Thank you.    Boogeyman is actually rather good. Not revolutionary, but good. Not the most original game in all of gaming history, but really, really solid. And as an added bonus, and unlike some other super-recent FNAF 'clones' (Emily Wants to Play? Emily Wants to Suck My Big, Fat ♥♥♥♥, more likely!), it lays down its rules simply and clearly and just ups the stakes from there. In other words, it's clever enough, without being TOO 'clever' for its own boots. Sure, it messes with you, but it's mostly quite fair and doesn't wallow TOO much in 'cheap deaths' the way that many FNAF wannabes - and the FNAF games themselves, for that matter - do. And I suspect it would be better still with one of them Oculus Rift thingies.    Definitely recommended, not ONLY to Freddy fans, but to horror fans in general. No great shakes - maybe a few decent scares, at best - but a very solid premise with very solid gameplay and a few minor tricks up its sleeves. Nice.   Verdict: 8.5/10.   (PS All you 'Freddy' fanatics DO know that there was a very famous horror 'Freddy' long before the Fazbear? Just a minor example of how you little tiddlywinks DIDN'T invent ANY ♥♥♥♥ing wheels. Google it if you need to.)",

Mabye it is the electrical fails or Wierd Voices at night but there is always that that will stay there. His name is boogeyman...  This game literally made me jump on a jumpscare so much that I jumped and hit the back of my chair and scared everyone watching the movie that was put on the tv.  If you don't want to be scared too much you can turn off the house exploration but I am trying to not be a wuss soo yeah... More hitting my head against the back of my chair for me :D  If your into horror or want to get into the scaring experince try this. It doesn't take long to download. Just try it out for 20 min. and your be suprised how scared (in a nice way, boogeyman does that) you will be just from a tiny game.  8.5/10",
