I would probably love it if it had full english audio, but this way reading subtitles all the time is too distracting.  Pro's: +Beautiful retro graphic +Funny as hell +Cheap  Con's: -Fully enjoyable only to people who understand Russian -To many interaction options",

Except alcoholic beverage and boobies.  + Fascinating story + Great humour + Russian voice acting + Suitable music  - Some wierd gaps/pauses in middle of dialogs - Some sprites are drawn in worse quality than others - Minor errors in some translations/mouse over labels  Overall rating ☭/☭. Let's drink to that!",
