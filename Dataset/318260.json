            "review_text": "While this game has it's entertaining moments, it is not worth $13.99 in my opinion until they add some more features. The gist of the game is throwing on toppings, and driving through a small town in a car that's hard to control. Also, I hit a glitch after flipping my car, where my shop consistently lost $-7 a second, and made me up to -$15,000 in debt until I rage quit.",

The driving took a little to get used to but I mustard through it and now I am a driving champ. Although the direction arrow is still a little misleading I am getting the hang of it. The game did spaz out on me recently, kind of why I am taking a break. It just started deduction cash like crazy. Kind of funny I was over 2 million in debt, but the game kept playing anyway while it kept deducting like crazy. Over all I will have to give this a above average seeing how I love pizza and business. The 2 make a great match.",

I enjoyed the task later on of trying NOT to flip my car and of course trying to keep up my money. Even though in the end.... I ended up bankrupt, but I got pretty far. For once I am enjoying a game that is PG and appropriate for the workplace and around other children (which most of my older friends would enjoy since they have children). I would definitely enjoy playing this game as a get away from the typical games that are popular right now. Plus... my favorite part about this game has to be the cheesy events. :P Ahem... Mind Control.",

I would like to see others try it out, this game is fun to just play around on and see how far you can get, so much to do and with your spare time be able to play this and not get bored ^~^b",
