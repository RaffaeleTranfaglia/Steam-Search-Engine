            "review_text": "I bought this because I was a fan of the old NES game Blaster Master and this looked like a new version of that. From what I can tell I personally think it was worth my 5 dollars.  You get 3 gameplay styles; the side scroller inside the tank, a FPS style inside the tank, and a FPS shooter as a human outside of the tank. I didn't get far enough to see if there was any use for the human mode in the 2d side scroller, so that might come in later.  The controls were easy for me. I used the gamepad which used one joystick for moving, one for aiming, one trigger for jumping, and one trigger for shooting.  The depth perception in the 3D mode while jumping is a little tricky since you sometimes need to jump up or down and the camera didn't help much with that, so sometimes it was just a jump and hope you land in the right spot.  The A.I. enemies are very basic, they run straight for you and if they touch you it hurts. The first enemies can only jump, but some enemies can shoot soon after.  Overall, I enjoyed the 30 minutes or so I played to test the game out, and I plan to play more in the future to see all the cool upgrades the tank gets, and different guns the human gets. For my money, I'd give this game a 8/10 for price and enjoyment.",
