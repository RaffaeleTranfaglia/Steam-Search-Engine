            "review_text": "In depth.  The worst thing about this game is how horrendously poorly it starts off and presents itself. In that first hour of play, I was VERY tempted to claim a refund. I didn't feel any satisfaction in being a shop keeper, I had no idea what I was doing, there was very little in terms of tutorial (a note, text on pages will never be a good tutorial - give me prompts when starting out and you'll convey how to play the game more quickly and easily to the user), and I only had 3-4 customers coming by to buy health potions in the first few days.  Then the second hour hit. Then the window of a refund closed, and funnily enough, so did my desire to claim one. Then the third hour hit. Apparently the fourth has also hit but I have no awareness of that, I was too busy sweeping and restocking. Now it's far too late and I want to sleep, but not before praising the game.  If you ever wanted to be a retail worker who can brandish a sword and slaughter a thief or even just a rude customer, this is for you. The game is exceptionally good at simulating the busy shop nature. I have to stock so many of these items, but suddenly someone is stealing something, then some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ customer throws a shield, dirt is accumulating, my chest pieces are now out, my delivery of swords is in but all of a sudden no one wants swords they want armor, oh someone else is stealing, oh I thought someone was stealing but they were just running after I murdered the first thief now I'm an actual murderer, oh but the gloves are out as well...  Things get hectic. And it's pretty fun gameplay.  As I implied above, the biggest things to improve are:  • Tutorials that aren't trash. It's so commonplace to put a tutorial at the beginning that having a separate section handle it seems alien. Also a dozen pages of texts does not make a great tutorial. It was enough to get my feet wet but I'd much prefer button prompts in the first day. 'Push 1, now left click on the table to place your health potions' etc. It might not feel important, but with the 2 hour window for refunds, you should strive to set a better first impression. Throwing the user into the fray is a game mechanic for some games, but this isn't Dark Souls: Shop edition.  • Better UI. It's a bit of a mess when looking at all the skill pages. Part of the reason starting off needs a better tutorial is the skill pages overwhelms a new player a bit. There's a ton of crap all over the place. It should just be one page.  • Better overall interface. The game feels pretty amateurish. If you've played Town of Salem or some other browser game now on steam, that's the vibe I get. I don't expect triple A menus, design, etc. In fact, I don't expect the devs of this to do anything about it in this game. But it's something for the next game. And I can already tell they have talent mixed with creativity, so this is just a place to improve on.  As I keep playing, my list of cons grows shorter. But these three are pretty constant for me thus far.  All in all, this is a great game for a great price. $10 is ideal, but I could see $15-20 for this, granted at that much I'd likely shy away from the game just at a glance. Having played it now and knowing what I'm getting into, I can see a higher price point.  Give this game a try, you'll be glad you did. Really unique idea that's really well executed.",

            "review_text": "Such an awesome game with so much potential. Its great already but for going on playing, there is not enough content for me.  Please hurry, bringing more updates :P Co-op would be cool, such as animal breed or monster breed. Shop Assistants, more options for bots, more variety of items, better fighting, competitors, not only quests for selling but for going on an adventure by yourself instead of sending the champion, costumization of your own house, maybe some more depth in defending like monsters and more barbarians and maybe towers you can place outside to defend your shop. Colouring the furniture and walls. Mod-Support would be very important. It makes the game even better and then people are starting to talk about this game. The possibilities are endless with mods and i would be so happy to see some of these features in the future. PLEASE implement them! I would pay for more features because it is one of my favourite games. I want this game and developers to have a great future.  EDIT:   Today was the final Release of the game. The update itself brought just a few MINOR changes, no new content. Out of Early Access?! The game is not finished. Still the same bugs. Even what they promised in their forums like breeding is still missing. There also is still this 'contruction site' ingame. It was one the of best Early Access games i've ever seen but now its also one of the worst releases. There is a good negative review, last edited in august 15 i think, which complains about lack of content and the 'not finished feeling'. This game has no depth in this state. This is still what i think after full release of the game. I am disappointed... My review was a recommendation, now i can't recommend it and i wont until they have finished the game like they promised. (No i dont have a source for their promises but i clearly remember them)",

You get to start your own shop, which mostly sells armor, weapons and potions. Then there is a skill system which unlocks diffrent skills and perks that might come in handy. I can admit that the first couple of in game days can be kind of boring, since you will only be selling potions, but when you get past that state of the game, this is where it really takes off. Now after 2 hours I have a shop and an Inn. In my shop, I sell potions, weapons and armor to the people. But be careful, there are thieves lurking about. There is so much to this game and I believe more will be added! So if you like management simulation games with a medieval touch to it, this could be a game for you. I am eager to see what more the creators will add.  8/10",

Having things to grind for (achievements and in-game unlockables), and the tycoon-esque feeling of the game are what made it hit home for me.

Later game stock you can unlock takes a lot of time to organize if you want to show all the items. Lots of gameplay is spent sorting it's display furniture (or remaking it after a brawl of barbarians). Anti-theft is something one benefits from as soon as they can afford it and is the only thing I use the robots for.  If you like collecting achievements and use them as goals to give the game more direction, then I don't recommend this. With both pre-release and the final product I've had to restart thrice to earn achievements I've already accomplished. As someone who gets excited to have even a small amount of completed games, it's discouraging to know that players will never get 100% due to glitches and creator only icons.  Overall I found it fun but lost the urge of replaying it now that it's out. One of the downfalls of longer running early access titles.",

As you sell things and complete quests that are sell (x) items you earn kpoints which can be used to upgrade your skills as a shopkeeper. This allows you benefits such as new things to build to hold items, a champion to send to dungeons in hopes he will return with items, to unlocking new items for you to sell altogether. You can also interact with customers or potential customers to try and sell them items or buy some from them. Mages, Rogues, and Warriors all look the same at the start but as you sell them items they start to gear up giving them different looks. Its somewhat satisfying to know everything they own came from your shop. Great game for the price of it with many hours of shopkeeping fun and very active dev team with updates almost every week as of the time this was written.

I had to restart my shop because I messed up and didn't get enough profit at the start and couldn't afford to buy things etc. So make sure you make enough profit at the start to build up! Highly recommended.   This type of game is what I like to buy on steam, the games I actually enjoy. It actually teaches you how to handle money and how to earn money too, which is great considering my family own a business, so now I can say I have business experience ;)  Also, love what the J key does in game ;)   Oh and I sold some stuff to a guy named Justin Bieber.... lol what.",

            "review_text": "So after trying this again, i've got a new review, this time, it's still ... negative.   The GUI needs tons of work, just on the main menu.  Why is 'play game' not the top choice? Why is it in the middle? under options? what? FOV options without a number on it makes no sense when setting it from the main menu, yes there's a slider, but why is the slider not giving me any indication of what i'm actually changing? If i do it while i'm playing the effect is obvious, but there should still be a number on that slider. A lot of people have spesific prefrences inn this area, i myself prefere a FOV of 90, and not just an FOV of whatever the bar is currently at, 1/3 of the way to the right? What does that even mean?  Scrolling the mouse wheel in the 'rebind keys' menu literally gets you 1pixel down. Rebinding keys are kinda weird, a lot of the keys do the same thing, wich is fine, that's why you got the rebind menu afterall, so that's a pluss.  A few of the 'hitboxes' for some GUI elements are off, and weird, can't hit the music settings if you hover on it from below sometimes, also gotta hover on the left side, far right won't do much it seems. weirdest of issues.  Ordering items while in build mode should not force the player to wait for a delivery really. I don't see why this would needed as build mode is literally infinite time for building and shop managment. Making the player wait while he's restocking is pointless.  Please, atleast allow for time compression, when you start out the game you either have to go outside selling potions to every single customer you see manually, or stand next to your pedestals for 5 minutes to keep them stocked to earn that sweet 1-2 gold profit.   This review is all from 30 minutes before i gave up due to boredom, the gameplay is not for me, but i see how some people may like it. Graphics are ok, and quite fitting for this type of game.  I will not reccomend this product at this current time, i'll still label it early accsess to be honest. Tested on windows. ",

I tried thinking of positive points, but all I could come up with was the general concept, which has a lot of potential, and the soundtrack, which is decent. Unlike Recettear, though, there's no story, no content, and there's pretty much nothing to do. You just wait around, scratching your nuggets while waiting for customers.   All in all, this is a cheap, stripped-down replica of Recettear. I'd pay triple the price to play a good shopkeeper game. Too bad that at least to my knowledge, at the time of writing this review, Recettear is still the only one that exists.

There is just too much messed up, that after a year is not fixed. First of all. The buildings and the walls are all put together with no effort. you can easily see seams, and where the textures don't correctly meet or align. Trust me when you spend the entire day in the shop staring at the walls, you notice this.  Second is my main issue. Where the game seems like a neat idea at first, it quickly just boils down into tedium. There is no story or plot, no reason to continue. You just get to the point where you have bots and forget everything else.  Lastly on a more personal objection... you can't jump. The devs have something against giving you the ability to jump. Maybe they think they are cute in doing that? They clearly do NOT understand the mind of a gamer. If you are playing a First person game where you have to wait around awhile for something to happen... you want to jump. this is just one of those gamer habits that will never die. The dev is ignorant for not acknowleding this, especially since I can assume they won't let you jump because of the 'arrow to the knee' meme that should be long dead. Early versions had an arrow in your leg. It makes what could just be a slow game to something beyond annoying.  So slap-dash buildings, no plot, tedious game play, no jumping..

            "review_text": "One thing, Thanks to the developer for trying to get me to get the game to work, and addressing the thing in the game that was my issue since I couldn't do it myself.   TLDR: If you are looking for a game where you are the manager of a shop, then this game is most likely for you. If not then you probably are looking at the wrong game here.   This game is quite fun actually. It is a shop management game where you manage you stock on items, watch out for thieves, protect your shop from barbarians, and watch the prices of your goods. I could stay here for quite a while and talk about all the mechanics in this game, which I actually did at first, (got to ~8000 characters, which is about the limit on steam reviews) so instead I will just talk about the pros and cons I believe are with this game.  Pros - You are in control of the entire shop. Gotta do the restocking, organizing, pricing, stocking, killing, crafting, and watching over the shop of course.  You are to place items where you want, besides a few restrictions. Item sizes comes into play in where you can place certain items, examples include gloves being small items to shields being medium items. Also has restriction in the fact that boots, even though small, can't be placed on shelves. You are also able to place the objects, that you place items on, mostly anywhere, as long as they are not too close to each other, too close to the wall, or in a range of the door. There is a quest system of some sorts. These consists of selling x amount of items to gain Kp. Decent progression. Multiple tiers of items to sell. Objects have 8 orientations.  Many items to sell and buy. Items include, weapons, armor, potions, seasonal items, crops, and some misc items.  Includes crafting. Crafting is done by using certain liquids, there are 6 different ones, and some items to craft new items to sell. For example, plate armor + gold makes gold armor. etc Can gain items ranging from trash to super rare from the towns trashcans. During the game day, trash cans will fill up which you can sift through the trash to find items ranging from torn pages, bones, leather armor, or even up to gold and higher stuff.  Shop expansions are available. Can expand the size of the shop 5 times. Can automate quite a bit around the shop. There is a bot you can unlock to help with picking items up, dealing with thieves, and helping restock on items, and can even have them place the items down at the %margin that you wish them to be placed at.  There is clear late game items you can obtain. Different tiers of items, champion can gain expensive items with the adventuring and the luxury items.  Rare items to spice up some of the stuff you sell. Can buy items from customer to sell that you can no get anywhere else. These items can also be gotten through the champion or from the trash cans.  There are skills you can upgrade throughout playing for you to modify the way you play for the most part.   Cons - Early game gets a little stressful, since you are making sure you have your items in stock, dealing with thieves, cleaning up the dirt customers track into the shop, and picking up items people throw down. Quest system is kind of lackluster, it consists of just selling x amount of items, which makes sense in a game like this but would like to see a bit more variety than the same sell x amount of this items, I don't know what they could do to add some flavor to this but who knows. Of the orientations, the angled positions don't match the angled walls of the shop.  Some of the late game luxury items are not really needed. The floor mat for example, says 'unlimited durability' or something like that and I haven't had a floor may break nor lose durability, so maybe its just bugged. The cauldron is not that useful either since can just look at wiki for recipes.  The automation from the bots lags the game if you have too many of them up. Doesn't offer the fact to disable the seasonal particle effects, aka snowing since you can still tell its winder by the snow on the ground.  Champion is quite annoying. The lower level areas take around 1 min when you get to a certain level. So when your champion is lv30 and you want to do the first area to get some mage books or something you end up going to the back of the shop 14 times roughly in the 15 min day periods. Now I don't know if its right or not, but the wiki says the first area is 1 min if you are just above lv 10, aka it means can send them in naked and they will do it well. Now if thats true then they should add a feature for if you are above x level to go to the area more than once so your'e not running back and forth over and over an over again. Crafting is annoying since the liquid holders only hold 40 of each of the 6 liquids and you have to empty them individually. So 40 clicks every time you get it full. There isn't a hold down option or a empty all just all 40 clicks each.  Crops are a little annoying, being as its one of the only things in the shop you can no automate.  The barbarians are not really that threatening since all of them die to one spell or 2 autos. Only big deal is barbingantua which can be easily kited.  Some achievements are tedious, aka the thief one in particular. You can easily sell items at high prices without thieves and there are even skills to make it so thieves steal even less as well. aka unless you sell things at 1000% the price or something you wont be getting thieves to be able to get the achievement. I can easily sell items at 475% and with that price for over 20 hours not one single thief. Making more than enough money since I am late game already and have everything unlocked for the most part. Could use some more classes, to have more items.  Could add more item tiers as well, since getting to late game doesn't take that long if you upgrade income at the start of the game.  Customers don't really sell that many good items to you. I can get maybe 1 sombereo of sound from customers every maybe 2 hours if that at all.   Overall though the game is definitely a good buy and if you are interested would recommend.  Hoping for an update in the coming month that might add new features or items who knows. But enjoy the game if you end up grabbing it, worth the price and is a great game to have.",

I am playing at the lowest setting possible, and the FPS is just terrible. It makes me sick just by looking at it. The trailer for the video is so smooth, and yet so many of us can't even get 30 fps with the lowest setting, something is seriously wrong.  I am not giving up on this game anytime soon, but if after several months go by and nothing changes, well I would definitely not recommand this at all.",
