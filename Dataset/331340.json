            "review_text": "This game is beautiful and haunting and amazing! I knew as soon as I saw it on kickstarter that it would be incredible and it surpassed my expectations. The puzzles are perfect difficulty, and you dont have to have uber micro to be able to play. Also its nice and short, so actually possible to be able to get through it when you are a busy person :) The music is absolutely made for this game (or the other way around!) story line is awesome and I hope they do an interview about it, but I'm sure they'd prefer to leave it up to everyone else to decide ;) Hope that was spoiler free enough! hehe :D  This is the first game thats made me want to instantly replay it the moment I'd finished it!  Great game. Ammy gives it a million stars out of 10.",

Unlike a lot of similar games, once you figure out what you need to do you'll probably be able to do it without too much work (easy skill level). It was fun the whole way through. I'd recommend it if you like short, relaxed puzzle games.",

            "review_text": "I'd totally remove the 'puzzle' tag for this very, very short game.  Basically, this is a sidescroller with some obstacles, where you use one ghost-like character to reach and manipulate objects that the regular character cannot. The game sacrifices the logic in the name of the surreal flavour. Yes, this means 'trial and error' most of the time. Like Hapland.  The controls are not horrible, as other people claim. Granted that using X and Z together with WASD movement is very awkward, but you can use Shift and Ctrl instead.  The atmosphere is great at some points, and just off in others. The 'Ophelia is Distressed' thing in the first part was great, why did that stop? I was expecting more of that. Actually, I was expecting more of everything, the game is ridiculously short.  Only get this during a sale.",

Controls were awkward and it took me 15 minutes, a walkthrough, and at least 20 deaths to figure out the first puzzle, because the game didn't give any hints.  Good concept, awful execution and design.",

To sum up, it is very interesting, and that keeps you playing for a little while but the puzzles and the controls are just too annoying to make it an enjoyable game.",

            "review_text": "This game eschews clear puzzle design in favor almost arbitrary puzzles that have a tendency to immediately kill you. The challenge isn't so much 'what to do' as 'what am I even supposed to click on?' The control scheme doesn't help either: You switch between two characters, a presumably not dead girl, and her ghost boyfriend. The girl can push and pull certain objects, and the ghost can pick up and move objects and interact with distant switchs. Sounds good, right? Except the girl 'dies' if the ghost gets too far from her, 'too far' being 'about 6 feet'. To that end, she'll follow the ghost around, including right off ledges to her death. Since the ghost's interactions are all controlled via the mouse, and the girl's via the keyboard, and you lose if they ever split up for more than 15 seconds, there's no reason you should have to switch characters at all.",

            "review_text": "I would not recommend 'Tulpa'.   As a game, it's not great. The keys used are WASD to move, X&amp;Z for actions, and the mouse. This is pretty hard to play with, as moving my hand around to move while holding X [for example to move something] is extremey awkward, and the controls cannot be re-mapped.  The visuals in the game are nice, although I am missing any symbolism here, because I have no clue about the subject matter of 'Tulpas'. Nearer the end, the game starts to use some evangelion 3 level visuals which fit right in to the game, but I have no idea what they mean.  This is actually true for a lot of the game. There are many puzzles where I found the solution just by random chance, and some things are never really explained.  Perhaps if you like the subject matter you would enjoy the game, but i cannot recommend it for anyone who doesn't.",

In addition, there are some flaws related to mouse control - sometimes some parts are clickable too late, making player think that it's not clickable at all. Apart from that from audiovisual side it's quite nice, that doesn't save the day for the game though.",
