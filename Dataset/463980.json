Don't let that scare you off. If you want a nice game where you can use a little strategy and a little luck to kill some time, this is the one for you. It has decent graphics and humor to boot. I love it!",

It's your basic golf Solitaire with basic RPG elements thrown in - collecting power, casting spells, enemies that can attack, etc. Add in some basic rogue-like elements (each game is a run of enemies, culminating in a final boss) and this is a winner. Pick it up if you see it on sale, and you too will be after just one more run... just one more run...",
