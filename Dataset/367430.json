            "review_text": "Redshift Blueshift is the type of game that you would get if you combined Pong with a shoot 'em up. In the game you control a spaceship that also works as a paddle. You need to hit the ball when it is your turn. When it is the other player's turn you can shoot powerups that either give you an advantage or hurt your opponent.  I had some fun with Redshift Blueshift. While the game has a single player mode I would recommend playing against another player since the computer difficulty levels are either too hard or too easy.   While I enjoyed the game I wish the powerups had more of an effect on the game. For the most part you are just playing a game of Pong with the occasional instance where a power up actually influences the game. The only other problem I had with the game is that it is the type of game that you are only going to want to play in short doses. Redshift Blueshift is not the type of game that you are going to play for hours at a time.    If you like Pong I think you will enjoy Redshift Blueshift.

            "review_text": "Had the pleasure of meeting the developers of the game at EGX and I must admit I had a little bias going into the game, due to the developers raw passion and likeability. I definitely wanted to enjoy the game so was worried that may cloud my judgement initially, however upon playing the game and noting its simple yet effective gameplay, there wasn't too much for me to deliberate over. The real question is was it fun?  The game is a 2-D pixel-art Shmup/Air Hockey hybrid (and if that combination hasn't at least garned your curiosity I dont know what to say) and is most enjoyable for my tastes in its split screen multiplayer. The rules of the game are simple, the outcome often quite the opposite, with chaotic fast-paced plays and exhilirating back and forths that'll have you shouting at the top of your lungs one way or another. As the ball bounces between each players spaceship, the rapidity of the game increases, as does the tension as one simple slip up could cost you a round. Power ups matching the color of each ship will appear on screen and can be shot down to recieve power-ups such as shields and offensive turnouts, perhaps one of my few gripes with the game would be that I would like to see more creativity in said powerups as they could add more versatility to the experience.   I understand that a barrage of power-ups could over complicate the experience however. An online option would also be most appreciated, as I personally feel the need to show off my skills to the public as I am the try-hardiest of tryhards but nonetheless the devs have crafted a wonderful title for their first outing on steam and I sincerely wish them the best of luck as Red Shift Blue Shift shows a great deal of promise!",
