However I would not recommend it because of two major flaws:  - No online multiplayer.  - Not colorblind friendly  I also found that the achievements were way too easy, I got all the 'challenging' ones within my first 5-6 games - without even seeing the difference between yellow and green.",

This game is ideal if you have 10 to 15 minutes to kill and you just wnat to chill out for a bit. With various games modes like 'Endless', 'Race', 'Mission' and Time Trial', Anode will be sure to keep you entertained.  So go on, grab it now ... you won't regret it :)  (I Came, I Saw, I Conquered)",
