All I see is negative comments, the game is not the same as the last one, yes it has its similarities like all games to but it feels fresher, the racing is fun, the career is fun and I'm sure I will spend many hours playing it.  People get mad and write bad reviews because they are used to MX vs ATV physics.. Once you get used to it, you will find the MXGP physics are actually better IMO.  It's not stupidly expensive so yeah, its worth the money and its a straight racing game.",

The bike sound needs to be more realistic to run along side the Amazing job they have done with the feel of the riding experience? The game feels great. The reason it dose my head in is that I ride 2 STROKE!! Why do they sound like a 4 stroke? I can live with the 4 stroke engine JUST! &amp; think this could be improved too. I cant play any game without sound? Dont know about you? Please please please go and record some engines then add them to the game?? How can in 2016 this not be possible? just get on a bike, record the sound as it goes around the track and cut the sounds you want. We all know how great motocross bikes sound so add it in the game please. You dont get this with say F1 games do you? How would F1 fanatics feel if the cars sounded like tractors going around the track? The feel is taken away from realisticness.   Sorry for the rant guys but it just dose my head in:( Any one else with me? &amp; How do we get them to look at this?   ",

            "review_text": "After a good while in the game I have decided this game is worth the buy, just not for $50. It improved on the first MXGP in many ways. The graphics are touched up, the physics were redone, very weird at first but after awhile they are fine. The customization from the career rider stand point was well needed. The stadium series is a major let done as the tracks are far smaller then any mx game that has 'supercross'. The much needed addition of 22 riders was a big thing for me. The only REAL downside for me is that the game appears to have some serious frame rate lag. 20-30 fps while in races and 100fps while in the menus has me a bit concerned but then again that could very well be on my end. I say if you are hoping for a better MXGP then go ahead and purchase. Yeah the price of $50 is a bit concerning but then again the demand for Motocross games is very high. All in all I give it a 7.5/10",

Honestly did not think to much of it at the start with the stock bike, it was overturning way to much even with adjusted suspension settings etc it still just felt very sluggy and the engine sounded like a hotted up tractor engine....Until you upgrade your bike. What a game changer that is let me tell you! Everything changes from the handling to the engine sounds, most of the physics have been changed and mostly for the better imo. Multiplayer works fantasticly besides the odd didsconnect here and there and the leaderboards seem to be working fine with no hackers as of yet. Graphics have been improved and different textures on the tracks which is nice for a scenery change, the AI have been re worked and are much more of a challenge now - get ready for some epic MX racing! Just give this game some time if you do are not liking it at first and play around with some settings. Cya in the multiplayer for some racing!",

            "review_text": "Simply amazing. If you enjoyed the 1st MXGP game then you'll love the improvements they made. If you didn't like the first one I suggest you go into it with an open mind. It's similar but it isn't just an update, it has it's own character.   Things that could be improved on:  AI - Collisions are not fantastic, it's forgivable but it does take away a bit from the experience. Also the AI is just slow. They're programmed to take slower lines which in turn makes the 'realistic' difficulty not very realistic.  Multiplayer - Unreliable. Because it doesn't use dedicated servers your experience is effected by your internet connection. It also loses connection 70% of the time.   That being said the game is fantastic. The graphics are beautiful and the customization is really what the 1st title was missing. The career mode is everything I had hoped for after the improvements they made in their MotoGP series that I loved so much. It improves on the base set in 2014 and worth the pickup for any moto fan.",

Create your own team in career Indoor tracks Test Track (like factory teams have)  Bad: NO 2 strokes? Same engine note whipping is different and difficult  OH  AND the whinning about it being the same is IRRELEVANT. You all buy 2k games, madden games, nhl and mlb. Can't complain about this game, as it has improved, but can and will get better through  user feedback, updates and dlc. Chill TFO",
