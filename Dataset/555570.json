            "review_text": "There are a lot of negative reviews on this game, so I just wanted to share my perspective being a long time War Z veteran. This is really not a bad game.... I would say that most of the reviews are negative because of the players who have never touched a WarZ game in their life, and expect to dominate in the PvP aspect of things. There's definitely a learning curve involved, but if you're willing to make an effort to learn the mechanics of the game, you'll be fine. Also, WarZ has always had a more arcade like feel, rather than a realistic one. If you don't like that, try a game like Day Z, or Miscreated. Devs seem for the most part active and involved, and are good at communicating with their community, unlike the devs of I:SS. From what I can gather, they seem to care about a lot more than just their pocketbooks. Another thing I was very concerned about was this being a free to play title, with in game purchases leading to pay-2-win tactics. However, I found that this is NOT the case when it comes to this game. Anyone playing for free can be JUST as competitive with a premium player. All in all, I think it's a decent game, and DEFINITELY an upgrade from I:SS Classic. Plus, it's free, and who doesn't like free?",

            "review_text": "*I have never heard of the New Z before it coming out on steam and tried it out for the first time yesterday*    First off I want to say this game is free. Meaning there should be no reason for you to listen to reviews. You should play it and see if you like it or not.    For a free game it's actually alright. There are no pay to win elements what so ever except being able to buy premium which is like unturned premium, yes you can buy meds and ammo for real life money, but you can also do so with ingame money which is easy to get. In my 3 hours I have well over 150 grand which is more than 20+ dollars can buy.  This game is mainly pvp, with meds that have cool downs to use during fight, barricades to block off bullets, and a sweet arcade feel for combat that is not realistic at all.  Killing zombies is quite rewarding as well and there is a skill gap in this game. You can find clans that go in together and run parts of the map on servers, so skilled gamers will enjoy this game.  Remember this isn't a survival game but a shooter with zombies, where you find loot like meds, armor, guns, etc. and then go to pvp. That's the whole game. But it is fun to play and free. All negative reviewers are ♥♥♥♥ing stupid or are rating this way to harshly.  Overall: 7/10 *Fun to play with friends every now and then and free*",

            "review_text": "This game is a good free to play alternative to the mainstrem survival horror titles (Dayz, H1, Forest) However this title lacks teh depth of the aforementioned and is more comparable to the likes of Unturned. The lack of depth results in players becoming fully equiped quickly and having no further goals as the game lacks Base building and a crafting system.  Additionally the freemium which this game has adopted could be a turn off for consumers as it does result in many fustrating barriers to entry for free player such as having to wait to be revived after death. It also results in some elements that could be considered pay to win by some however it is mitigated by allowing free players to earn store credit through gameplay which can purchase MOST of the same items.  This game provides a slighty more immersive experience than that of unturned however lacks many of the crafting and base building mechanics which is expected by a game in this genre, however it is still a good survival horror game given its development history and ease of access.",

I recomend this game to anyone who is looking to have an exciting h1z1 experience, without the lies of having a f2p game (you know, what the h1z1 devs said it would be originally). This game does have a bit too much of an advantage towards players who have more playtime, but beginner servers help a little with that. Overall, bring your friends, because this f2p game is a pleasant experience,   Sound-6/10 GamePlay-8/10 Visuals-7/10 Community-KOS My grade-7/10 ",

This game deserves a (y) Because the devs are making every thing to make this game more and more popular and IT IS NOT THE SAME GAME AS SERGEI TITOV HAD (trust me its not) and deserves every minute of your gameplay.. i hope the developers continiue creating this game even more and more every single day  now what do i believe? i believe that you should play this game even if you hated the real iss because it is not the same game (not by the same devs) and btw! Fredaikis ! do something about the graphics if possible please. we are not back in 2012 :) much apreciated!  10/10 would play again.",

            "review_text": "Let me start by saying i have had a strong love of this game since the original games release although that turned to ♥♥♥♥ rather quickly, and i have played a few of the different emulators. however many problems this game has its difficult for me to find a game similar to all the things us loyal fans love. The PVP just always feels so nice, along with just farming zombies and loot.  I think a big misconception everyone has of this is that it isnt a zombie survival game... it just isnt. people need to drill this out of their brain because it completely isnt, zombies are just existant along side a FULL PVP GAME with loot along side also.   Another big problem people have to complain about with the game is that 'oh i die super quick everytime by somone just after i spawn' the start is hard and tbh it has things you have to learn to pvp right. yes when you have no gear there is the little startup where you have to at least survive to the walk from the forest into a city to get guns. The struggle that follows this is fully geared people who might hang in the cities generally run with medkits/dx's along with riot shields to place giving them an advantage in a fight. then after that is skills that will make people more difficult to kill (health/less damage taken/better weapon stabilisation) but these are part of the grind that you get them from killing zombies.  The early game grind in this game isnt even nearly as bad as other versions of the game with weapons being so common and zombies giving a lot of GD so you can buy things like riot shields and meds if you dont find them yourself. so this complaining is irrelevant imo.  other than all of these yes the game has quite a few bugs which to some people might make them not like the game but i cannot deny that since the original release of the first warz the pvp and farming in this game has been SUPER satisfying to me and there is no PVP/Zombie/Looting game really that exists similar to this and if anything i enjoy the state of NewZ right now a lot better than the original intention of warz as the pvp and stacked gear looting is what i love about this game.

There is no P2W, i don't understand how people got this idea in their head.  -NO! This game is not for everyone. It's PVP to the core. Kill or be killed. Get your friends on and go on a rampage.  -NO! This game doesn't look glorius but it runs SO MUCH SMOOTHER than the other games.   I have been part of the WarZ/DayZ/Infestation/DeadZ community for many years and had A LOT of fun in it.  Just keep an open mind and own a few friends or get gud.

            "review_text": "I love the game so far. But i see how it can get boring for some people. I'm gonna give some feedback so the devs know what to fix. Here goes:  - First off,the map is either too large / you're moving too slow / nothing's happening so that when you're on foot things can be kept interesting. Maybe make the character a bit faster / make the map a bit smaller. Also make it so that you can see randomly spawned resources on the roads while moving. And maybe add random spawn chance for drivable vehicles on the road. Just to keep things fresh,since there's a lot of complaints of the game just being 'Walk,get resources,die,repeat' and people get annoyed fast and just quit.  - Make the chance for guns spawning smaller. Make it higher for food, ammo and such. When i kill someone, most of the time they're carrying like 20 guns and almost no ammo cuz they dont know what they're doing. They barely have food and things I personally need so it doesnt make sense to kill others most of the time. Also remove some of the guns. Let's say, have 1 pistol, 3 rifles and 2 shotguns. Noone needs so much different ammo types. I say keep the FN Night Stalker Scar. That's one good rifle that'll be good if you keep it.  - Remove the new character starter items. I'm saying this cuz even i exploit this sometimes. When you use a character for a long time,you gather resources and store them in the global inventory. Then since you've got nothing on that character, you make another one and get food, a flashlight and some water. This CAN and WILL be exploited. Make it so that when you create a new character, you start off fresh, like the apocalypse just started. Yes it'll be harder for new players to make progress, but that's what the beginner servers are for,right?  - Make it so that players with over 1 hr playtime CAN'T join beginner servers,since judging by my last statement, if beginner servers are for new players to progress through the game, advanced players can just join and ruin the flow. Also, remove spawn chance for rare items on beginner servers so its also fair for new beginners to not get killed by advanced beginners,if you know what i mean (no pun intended). And kick the players out of beginner servers when they reach 1 hr playtime on a certain character, since you need 1 hr playtime to play on official servers. And if they didnt progress with their first character, they can just make a new one and play on a beginner server again and not do that mistake again.  That's all, i hope the devs read this and do these things cuz they swore they're different and listen to the community. I'll recommend this game and give it a positive review cuz i love it so far. Please listen to me if you're reading this Fredaikis. That's all, have fun!",

This kind of adrenaline rush I only esperienced in the days of DayZ Mod. That was just great. And the amount of loot I was 'rewarded with' (took off the corpses eh) is insane. I hope I can log in tomorrow after work and bring it all to the camp site and stash it in my bank.  Gunplay is really great, something about it 'Just Works'(c), possibly a CS1.6 effect, meaning that the game mechanics are very simple, visual representation too and you're only left with the process happening before you eyes. It's definitely a cool game to spend some 20 mins per day with your friend, I have to bring my GF into this, should be fun.  JUST DON'T GIVE THESE DEVELOPERS YOUR HARD EARNED CASH. If they want it they must fix a lot of things and add more content aside from skins and loot boxes.  -----------------------------------End of UPD   The ground looks like some ♥♥♥♥ out of Vanilla WoW, no offense to Vanilla WoW.  But the game is already better than DayZ. It's actually fun to shoot. If they fix the graphics, add some real shaders, some fx on it, it can look good and play good.  Oh and also fix the spawns.

I'm gonna go ahead and pass for now. Might try it a couple more times but it seemed like a mess first impressions.  Edit: Ok 7 hours later I have to say, I'm changing my thumbs down to a thumbs up. Yes it has it's problems but I found a lot of fun raiding towns getting in gun fights with other players, killing zombies and then getting the heck out of dodge and back to the safe zone to unload all my awesome gear in the storage. I really like the idea of the inventory storage feature. Don't like the pay to play stuff but it's not too bad. I like the open world mode. The stakes aren't really that high because it's fairly easy to find guns so getting sniped randomly doesn't ♥♥♥♥ you off as much because you can bounce back pretty fast. Once you start making some successful loot runs, then you can just load up your inventory with guns before starting again. I like it.

Then spent about 10 minutes getting into another. Died almost as quickly as I spawned by shot in the ♥♥♥♥ing foot. Spent another 10 or so minutes to get in again, same ♥♥♥♥, spawn killed. I really didn't even get a chance to play.  I will say this, the graphics are bad and I mean really bad. Can't really comment too much on the mechanics because I really didn't get to use do or use anything.   1st impression, this game is nothing more than a steaming pile of dog ♥♥♥♥. Enjoy!",

(this being mentioned there is no PvE servers at all!) the battle ground spawn is literally the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing i've ever seen in a video game, it spawns you inside of like 5 other players and everyone just waits right there at the spawn to get kills. there is literally no point in even putting their half-minded thought into creating a map, you'd be better off making it a 10 foot square room and saying here you go guys. you have to try and join a server like 5 times before the game either doesn't crash or make you sit through the long ♥♥♥ loading screen just until finish and it notifies you that you have been disconnected from the server. the only positive thing i could say about this game is that it's free, not that anyone would pay money for this peice of ♥♥♥♥ game created by people with the brains the size of hampsters.

From there, after being harassed with spending money, trying to find a server to play on via the gameplay modes and navigating the server screens (plus, you can only sort by ping which is depicted as bars like a cellular signal) is quite cumbersome. They somehow managed to ♥♥♥♥ up the basic essentials to like every multiplayer game ever made.  Loading screen bar doesn't actually show loading progress at all. After joining, my ping on the lowest server (US) was 600-2500ms.. I couldn't find a server that dropped below 600ms and most times they were hanging in the ~1500 range and woud even spike to 4500. You can't see this number before actually joining the server, by the way.  It only gets worse from here. The high ping is obvious, even when picking up items/shooting zombies; essentially rendering the game uplayable. I kept going, though, in hopes of making something of the experience. You'll never be able to miss an item as they glow a bright blue. Mechanics of even the basic things like walking/strafing/springing/etc. are pretty bad and shooting guns feels like I'm playing with children's toys; extremely easy to aim and do a lot of damage, but god forbid you actually are able to hit another player that isn't stationary with the delay. People are spamming the global chat, players shoot on sight no matter what, and overall the community seems like a cest pool of inbred ♥♥♥♥tards.  The inventory system and overall mechanics of items is pretty horrid--an obvious ripoff that they somehow managed to make worse. And, aside from the foilage on trees, there wasn't anything particually worth looking at graphically speaking.  Going to just end the review here, really.. there's nothing about this game that warrants it wasting another second of my life.",

(taking their loot) But other than that, 2 modes STILL unavailable. The EXP/leveling system is poorly managed, and there are too many guns, not enough Melee options.  Oh and if you don't like Microtransactions being pushed on you - don't look at any shops.   I am an original 'The War Z' backer. I had high hopes back in the forums for the game, but it has NEVER once come through with it's promises. The company 'OP Productions LLC' Should simply be sued and forced to pay US for the problems. oh wait, they were sued, back in 2013.  This game is a joke guys. It's not 'changed' at all. It has all the flaws with a new title. The game hasn't fixed any of the game breaking problems it had, nor updated graphics. IT is stuck in 2012, using re-'early realease' as an excuse, and hoping this time you'll spend money in Micro Transactions to keep lining their pockets.",

Its clear this game was released before it was even remotely ready to get some easy cash from players.   Pros:  Killing stuff feels great and when you get into gun battles with other people its really fun. Getting to keep your loot in a off server inventory so you can always start with something is a nice but I always feel like im grinding to put guns away so each time you spawn you can defend yourself.     Cons: It takes way to long to get into a server. And I constantly get kicked from servers. After you die there is a wait time which is pretty annoying. Even after the revive time has passed the game still says your dead and you cant respawn. When you hit the disconnect button you cant cancel the action. Game bugs out when you try disconnecting from server and lose gear you have been getting for the past half hour. Every time I get killed its from one shot of a sniper from someone hiding behind a tree on the outside of a town.  The boss zombie isnt hard to kill but more than anything its just stupid. Its in the center of every town making is super annoying to try and loot. The agro range of it is too far. You'll be running 100 feet away from it and it will chase you until it kills you. It can run faster than you and after it kills you it camps your loot until it despawns. Ive even been walking in a building and the boss is just casually walking through and just follow you and punch you until you die.",

Even the WarZ was less buggy than this ♥♥♥♥. Maybe the reason its called the 'NewZ' is because the devs have decided to put some newborn, downsyndrome ridden chimps at the base of producing this steaming pile of excrement.   It'll say I've played for 3.5 hours, 3.4 of which were trying to join a bloody server. The incompetent devs decided to purposly buy ♥♥♥♥ server or something like that. You'll constantly get 'Disconnected from server' or something like that, and to say that this game has had a few re-issues over the last few years you would have thought they could have overcome this.   Verdict: The game is ♥♥♥♥. Wait until the devs do something with the game in stead of wanking into eachother's pockets and saying its a prank, which is currently what they're doing.",

Sound effects are ok. No story line, no back story. Game lacks depth, immersion, and an end game. Screen shots you see on the advertisment lean towards false advertising. As far as equipment goes, there's stuff all over wich is good to help the new players but the packed servers make it hard for anyone to have a chance to even get a knife before they are gunned down. Free to play is limited to FTP servers only. The interations with melee weapon vs zombie are poor. Can't really judge distance and it goes through them, then they react. Armor in the game has little use as it protects you from nothing. Would not recomend. But I would recomend they pull this game off until it reaches it's full potential.",
