            "review_text": "If you're looking for a free-roaming game like Grand Theft Auto, fuhgeddaboutit. Mafia 2 has an open world, stores to shop at or rob, a police system, and many other things you'd expect from that sort of game, but like Mafia 1, the game is a lot more structured, and instead of having much in terms of side content it plays out like a traditional game campaign, with little time for free roaming. But the game's world is still well-designed, even if it's mostly pretty window dressing, and it makes the campaign feel more alive than it would if it was just a corridor shooter. It's not an amazing game, but it is a unique one. Mafia 2 is the kind of game where the police are actually police, and even though they'll probably never catch you they'll still try to ticket you for breaking the speed limit. It's the kind of game that isn't afraid to be a little tedious to give a sense of contrast between a 'normal life' and the mafia life, like an early level that has you packing crates into the back of a truck to test your patience until you give up and leave. The developers do a good job at recreating the time period, and the cars, radio, and weapons all handle and sound pretty nice. The story and gunplay are both pretty well-done, and overall if you're a fan of mafia stories like The Godfather than Mafia 2 is worth a shot, as long as you don't go in expecting a true open world game.",

            "review_text": "Mafia II. Note that I have, at this moment in time, never before played Mafia I.   Although I have played other such titles, for example Mafia Wars, The Godfather games, Omerta City of Gangsters and of course GTA and also Saints Row.   This game, has by far one of the most gripping main story lines I have come across for this genre. (Personally)   I played this first on Xbox 360, and I have many many hours clocked.    Now I shall tell you about a few features.    Car mechanics;  the driving is lovely and realistic. No manual gear changing or first person head turning ( I belive there is a fine working modification for first person) but everything works smoothly as it should. You can turn on or off a speedomiter on as far as I know all cars. There is also an option to turn on or off realistic driving ( more slipping when it's wet with rain and snow, realistic breaking, that sort of thing. ) Car damage is very well done and there is a car mechanic shop at your service, as well as a few other types of shops : ) you as the player cannot shoot out of windows as far as I know without some sort of modification to the game, but other NPCs in the car can and will if need be ( if they use a gun normally xD ) You can open the bonnet and boot of most cars, which is a lovely feature :) they really did well on the cars, I mean you can take the hubcaps off from damage.. taking out the lights and tyres is very fun and rewarding.. shooting through the windows is very nice.. the bumpers bounce about nicely when they partly come apart.. spinning out and drifting is very nice, aaandd, you can shoot the sirens to stop them xD! There are many many vechicles to see and drive, from armoured vans and trucks to small sports cars and hotrods : D.   Next is the violence mechanics;   Shooting is very well done, you can also punch up enemies with your fists.. the fighting is well done!   You can kill someone instantly if you shoot the head, so there is minor locational damage, and all animations are very good. There is blood also.  There is a good cover system, alowing you to take cover on most objects however they are. You can also destroy most objects as you please.  Atmosphere;  It feels veryy genuine. The music, crisp textures and wonderful lighting provides a truly nineteen thirtys to seventys feel. Something perhaps out of The Italian Job, or a James Bond movie..   There are many many songs out on the few radio stations.. from home radio to car radio you can listen all the time :D  Oh, voice acting is absolutly top notch. For the most part there are no hiccups!  You can dress differently, answer phones and use rest rooms, buy drinks and food, and take a stroll out and about.   I love this game. I hope you will or do too :)  ",

            "review_text": "Mafia II is a game that should be played mainly for its Story. The pace is great from the very beginning were it tells the Story of your character when you were younger and how you end up doing what you are doing. You start doing little jobs here and there to get some money to pay a debt left by a family member. Right from the start you feel that family is the most important thing but as you go deeper and deeper you realize that it's hard to not involve the ones you care because of your decisions. As you go through the Story you experience a better life with better cars, a better house and most of all, more money, however, the main character wonders if this is what he really wanted to have when you end up doing things you may not feel proud of.   When you start the game it's Winter time. It's cold and it snows a lot. The roads are slippery and covered in snow. After some certain events I won't spoil, you return to the city during Spring time where everything feels more alive. More bright colors, people driving their convertible cars and the streets are finally filled with green grass without any sign of snow. As always, it's great to drive around town when it starts to rain. Feels good. This was a good idea to give you the feeling that time is passing. It's always interesting to see a different season after some time when playing a game.   The visuals are really well done. Facial animations are really good and they made a great job with the details on the characters faces such little scars or others 'imperfections'. The city feels amazing and things like bridges have great textures and look particulary well done. You can see that there was a big effort on the little details around the city too. Posters, prints and the Marketing about Cars, beer and other products are really well done using the culture from the time like the pin-up style.   There are not many side quests or activities to do as someone might expect from other open games but the Story makes up for it leaving you interested from start to finish. There are however some Collectibles that may extend your play through such the Playboy Magazines which is a nice touch and I'm sure it will take many more effort from players to search for them since they can be more interesting than, say, collecting dog tags or audio logs for completion purposes.  Bottom line, this was a good game with an interesting Story. I had great fun with it but I think it's time to move to the next game on my Backlog. I would honestly recommend this game and if you like the setting then you won't be disappointed to see the work they put in recreating these times paid of. *  Side curiosities:  - Some people requested this game to be banned in Italy due the fact that it could damage the portrait of Italian-Americans.  - It's one of the games that uses the 'F' word the most (more than 200 times).  - While there are Playboy magazines to be collected these did not exist in the time the game was occurring (1945 to 1951) only 7 years later in 1953. As for the images from the game itself they are from 1958 to 1968.",

Every single time, it never ever ceased to amaze me. why? Well let me tell you why.  For a start, this game is a timeless classic. Named: Mafia, and it is not just a title, it is what it is, a ♥♥♥♥in' good Mafia game! The story is dead on perfect, you'll play as Vito Scaletta, coming back from the war in 1945. And then you'll try your best, climbing the ladder to become a made-man and being part of the family.  PROS: - Still decent graphics considering its a 5 years old game - Solid gameplay, good brawls and gunfights, and good physics - One the best ♥♥♥♥in' mob game soundtrack ever made - The songs on the radio, and inside cars are simply awesome and matching each era. - Amazing storyline curving into 'open world style' side missions as well - Plays well on a controller if you prefer (tested on an Xbox 360 one) - Solid 15-20h of gameplay if you do all side quests as well  CONS: - Story's ending cuts way too abruptly for my taste, even though i know Vito will be in Mafia III - Best to also play Joe's side, in Joe's Adventure, but its not free as it's a DLC   (I highly recommend it though) - I would have taken 60h+ of this game, like...'gimme more jesus ♥♥♥♥in' christ!' You know?  Overall 9/10  SALUTE!  -Don Roberto",

Vito wasn't always a wellknown member of one of mafia families, his life wasn't so perfect before he became a dangerous gangster, he had it pretty hard in past. He looks dangerous, he could be an ex-con or war veteran or maybe both. All started the day he saw an opportunity for better life when his old pal Joe offered him easy money for job that is not for somebody with a weak stomach. Everything looked simple beat some guys take money, do some robbery, everything looked planned and pretty simple, what can go wrong?   The game has really interesting story that shows us most improtant events in Vito's life. Mafia II gives us a view of 1940's and 1950's America and all it in really impressive ways. I really enjoyed playing this one and the best moment in the game for me was when I met the main character of Mafia (first game). I'm really glad, that this sequel was made also by Czechs and they indeed did a hell of a job.    7.5 /10 ",

Mafia 2, with a few open world features, would be a solid 10/10 game. This game was stunning in nearly everything at its time and in a few aspects even to this day, still is.  The greatest strength lies in the main focus of the game: The Story. The story of Mafia 2 was able to make the player feel captured, something that is very hard for a game to do to me. This together with the awesome looking cutscenes, which even after 5 1/2 years still looks like from a modern game nowaday, made Mafia 2 like an interactive Movie. The Soundtracks are as well, overwhelming and are really supporting the strong atmosphere and experience.  As already said: The only negative aspect, this game has is the lack of free roam.",

It's possibly my most favourite storyline out of any game. You really get to know the characters in an emotional way and the action is insane! I may only have 20 hours on record but I've completed this game TWICE, and the only reason it's 9/10 is the ending. No spoilers but the ending truly was dissapointing, the way the game ended was dissapointing. I was so disheartened when I found out you couldn't continue in Free Roam after completing the story. If you wish to Free Roam you have to restart the story which in my opinion was a massive penisblock.  This is a must have game especially with the Steam sales, I bought this game a long time ago and for the price (now) of the low price of £4.99, BUY THIS GAME! I've also played the DLC but honestly, it doesn't beat the original storyline of Vito Scaletta. It kind of reminds me of the relationship with cousins Roman and Niko Bellic.",

            "review_text": "Shorten names: Mafia I (MI), Mafia II (MII)  Well this game is a great game, but not as great as MI (it's all about the story). We know that graphics aren't from the same time (MI 2002, MII 2010) and it's so obvious that MII have better graphics and mechanics but still I think MI is more superior.  In MI Tommy Angelo was a taxi driver who one night was smoking a cigarette for some relax :P and then he had unexpected passengers Paulie and Sam (he helped them escape from gangsters who were pursuing them). As a taxi driver he has a great driving skills, but he wasn't experienced with guns, so how in the hell he could drive and shoot from his car with that precision, on other side (MII) we have Vito who couldn't do the same thing (he was dependent on Joe's shooting skills :| ) if he was a soldier in WW II, driving jeep and   ♥♥♥♥   as he said ? :p In MI you have to deal with prohibition, uncomfortable to family politics, other Mafia members and dons, collect tribute, do special assassinations, bank robbery, racing and special side missions for 'bonus' cars.  MI was also more complex for example (pursuing Don Morello as I experienced it have 2 possible endings 1: you are far away from his car, so you have to shoot his starting plane on airport 2: you are near his car that will prolong that pursue (car won't turn left to the airport), after assassination of one of the politics the next part of mission depends on (one witness who was working near sewer, if you won't kill him he'll call cops so after exiting prison stage you have Feds looking for you or if you won't drop all weapons before exiting prison you'll meet Feds who will search Tommy for weapons). Also story was more surprising. In MII all you allies are indestructible they can run as human tank without hurting themselves also they won't be hurt in car (in MI you have to watch your and your allies health if you   ♥♥♥♥ up    repeat mission :P). It's the developers idea to make this game easy? even the ammo is simplified in MII, like in other games, 2/6 shots in barrel? nah it will use only 4 to make it 6/6 in MI any bullet is important why? Well Tommy gun have 49/50 ammo after reload it still uses full ammo of bullets it's because you threw away almost full magazine? (I like this idea) ^^ The health bar is regenerating (hard mode is 4/5 or 3/4), but enough about MI. MII:     improve your car (buy new plate and personalise it, 5 letters (Polish famous  K****    will fit perfectly ^^, tune up engine, repaint car, repair it (it won't look like in NFS Underground but it's enough))    (cars) why not include mileage meter like before in speed meter thing?    buy uniforms, jackets, and wear them as you like    simplisied daily basics (wake up, eat, drink, wear) :P    fist half quick time event fight system (that's pity that you won't use baseball bat, or knuckle-duster)    pick lock mini games    stealth missions no not like in Splinter Cell (you can drag body, but it won't be necessary / not enough enemy who would find corpse)     wide arsenal    and really? no sniper rifle, or sawed-off shotgun?    great retro music radio stations (it will ever contain news what happened before =&gt; mission)    cover mechanism (sometimes very annoying)    good storyline (even connection between MI and MII, won't spoil that thing, play for yourself to find out :P )    achievements!!!    porn mags xD    breakable objects    not as long as MI    not free ride option? (don't know about DLCs but i will find out someday)   In conclusion MII is a great game but still I feel there's something missing, maybe it's because of my nostalgia toward MI (replayed it 4 times). I can highly recommend this game, but better start with the first one (if you can struggle those old graphics) ^^  8,5/10",

            "review_text": "Ok, so where to start.... well done.  I say this with a caveat... that the game allows for replayability quite well in fact, but that it does not beckon such beyond control. It does not petition me to return, almost begging, but I know if I did, it would be enjoyable.  The role played is very well developed. It leaves plenty of time through the story line for the whole picture to be displayed, and although there is no leveling up or character development in the abilities gained or power increased sense, still gives much body to the perception that you are becoming more. The graphics are well designed, although slightly out of date, and are well rounded. Playability is not hindered by flavor and 'flowery touch ups' which add to the depth of the story, and I found no bugs during my playthrough on hard difficulty.  It is challenging at times, others a bit simpler and not as demanding. It does not get old or tired as to doing the same thing over and over... which is always a big thing for me as I revel in chaos and variety, and even the other characters speech and conversations do not break the atmosphere.  Overall, I would say this game is very enjoyable, leaves room and availability for replay, has challenge to it, and respects the age and experiences of mature people, also something I find lacking in most games.  In terms of mechanics, the only downside I found over all, and keep in mind this is after my having already enjoyed Fallout 4, Witcher 3, and Skyrim, is that (SPOILER ALERT) at various times in the game, you lose all your money, and most of the flavor add-ons such as suits etc. As mentioned already, the role is played almost flawlessly, and this aspect is no exception. Fortunately, by most standards and once you've played through a sufficient amount of the game, losing your money does not prevent you from continuing through the story, nor does it somehow make you less of a badass if your skills improve as they should with time. That being said, the concept that I can 'go home' at any time and the goodies that i've acquired will still be there, was lost; but take it with a grain of salt... the items lost can be acquired again without much time or difficulty, and you never lose your cars. :)   I would highly recommend this game. I believe most anyone even with quite vast differences in playstyles and genre preferences would find enjoyment with this game.  Good hunting.",

            "review_text": "I've been on an open-world game kick recently, and figured I would check out Mafia II before the sequel came out to see what all the fuss is about. Mafia II has moments of greatness and and some weird design quirks.  The biggest quirk seems to be that it's not really an open world game as there is no sense of exploration, no real gameplay systems that exist on their own, and time only passes to serve the main plot line. You get the idea that either it might have been a true open world game given an extra year to develop it, or that 2K games at that time just wanted everything to be open world no matter what so all that work was shoved in there for no reason. The majority of linear mission set pieces aren't even part of the open world locations, taking place on rooftops or warehouses or different locations entirely.  Which is confusing because what little exists of the open world is fantastic and had a lot of work put into it. The technology is really quite good for 2010. The seamless roads, distant LODs and number of pedestrians is up there with anything. The winter in the 40's feels exactly like how the movies show NYC. Snow and grime builds on your cars and everything inside has a cozy vibe. The dimmed sense of color and snow everywhere gives an almost black and white vibe, with Dean Martin's let it snow playing on the radio (despite not being period accurate... in general the game is not). The soundtrack is enormous (137 tracks from the era, vs fallout 4's 37). It is cool to walk around in an three piece suit and overcoat and also be in a crowd of other people wearing the same thing. Simiarly the cars are old-fashioned 80 hp steel death traps and drive and sound appropriately. Later on when things become a bit more vibrant sticking to your 3 piece suit and hat gives it a mad men feeling.  I found the writing quite solid, but is ultimately limited by the linear nature of the gameplay as well as the game developer mindset of this time where people tried to turn games into movies. All of the interesting stuff happens in cutscenes and you just ferry between them. I am glad they didn't try to whitewash history when it came to racism and such, but they also fell into quite a few tropes of their own which are areas for improvement.  It is worth picking up for cheap. Even if all you do is play the first couple hours it is worth it to check out the city a bit.",

The game really has a great tailored experience but in the end after all is said and done. I felt that it did not belong as a open world game. The open world aspect is very unexplored by the developers unless you buy DLC but as a stand alone game its there with little to no purpose. You see there is no side missions or anything that would involve requiring you to really go out of the linear path from Mission A to mission B. The game would have done better if it took a bit of extra time to flesh out the city with side missions like assassinations,racing, and other activities.  ",

Buttttt to the review of the game, starting with the backstory:  Mafia II is a Third-Person shooter where the player takes control of Vito Scalleta, an Italian-American who immigrated to Empire Bay, United States from Sicily, Kingdom of Italy in 1931, Vito being born in 1925, Vito's family is thrown into debt and economic difficulty, the great depression hitting them hard, eventually Vito and childhood friend Joe Barbaro form a close relationship in their teenage years, Vito's father drowns in the docks he works at so Joe and Vito have to turn to a life of crime to make ends meet.  After Vito is arrested for attempted robbery in 1943, he is given two choices: Jail, or fight for the US army in Operation Husky, the allied invasion of Sicily, Vito being fluent in Italian and Sicilian as well as English. It is here when the player takes control of Vito, as he and his band of US marines help liberate a smal Sicilian town, San Celeste, from Fascist Blackshirts loyal to Benito Mussolini, Vito is eventually injured later during the war and is temporarily discharged after being healed up, but is due to return to the front in a few months, after meeting up with his family, and finding out his younger sister still has to pay back debts of their father, Vito also meets up with Joe, who finds a way to get Vito fake papers to get him out of service. Vito, wanting to pay back his father's debt, decides that honest labor won't cut it, so he turns to the Mafia families in Empire Bay to get him enough cash to pay his late father's debt.  The game is great, a great plot with great characters, voice actors, music selection, and dialogue, Mafia 2, even if it can be beaten quickly, provides for hours of content and excellent gameplay, however, there are some things you should know about it:  This game, while being an open world game, doesn't have a 'free roam' mode (however there are mods that add this), and the game doesn't function like GTAV or Red Dead Redemption, where the game is in Free Roam all the time an you travel to missions in the world, this game functions more like L.A. Noire (another excellent title) where missions are the only way to access the world, as there isn't a free-roam mode. The game is still excellent regardless of the free-roam, and it's able to provide an excellent story with plot twists, betrayals, and surprise plot developments, Mafia 2 is an excellent purchase and once it is available on the Steam Store again, if you haven't gotten if already, you certainly should.   Also the game runs great but I'm too lazy to include a section about that.",

This is a really good GTA-clone game. My dislikes are on clunky melee combat mechanic and the wanted system. The wanted system is annoying because once you get wanted flag, you can't just go to clothing store or car body shop to loose the wanted flag, you have to shake off the police first and there are patrols everywhere. Overall a really fun game to play.  CONCLUSION : Recommended on full price, a must-have on sale price.",

Some can argue about lack of content 'forcing' you to play this game for such a long time, but Mafia 2 offers you as much playtime and enjoyment as you allow It to.  Main story is based on well known cliche, but still engaging if you cut away a few nonsense and plot holes. What outshines most of the other aspects is Empire Bay - beautiful lively town and I've enjoyed discovering It's every corner and building. Once you finish quite short main story, you can do some achievements with collectables or If you have DLCs, go ahead and play them! Joe's Adventures outshines the other DLCs in my opinion.  I would say Mafia II is very good game and you should sure play it, especially if you're interested in this type of games.",

And me old mum.She seems a bit of a blot, laid several pretty heavy trips on me.My spunky sister , well, she is in some bother with a loan shark.I decided to give him a biffing and after getting knocked ♥♥♥♥ up repeatedly I eventualy got the hang of fist fighting and the villian slunk of stage left muttering threats and minus his hat. Headed off to Joe's place through a vibrant, alive, city,people everywhere,vehicles, beautiful buildings, some good, some slums, the odd rat, it looked really good on my Windows7 32bit set up. At Joe's I saw something I have not previously seen in a PC game in 24 years of gaming, a bare female bum. Seen heaps and heaps of violence but not a single bare bum, that's bit odd when you think about it ,so good.Joe was saying see ya to a couple of working girls who had stayed over at his place. Wonder if I could have bunked down there for the night rather than stay at my old mothers cheerless hovel? . Joe stupidly let me drive his rather flash car. A big yank tank looked good, rear wheel drive. Anyone used to playing driving games and being on the wrong side of the road would have no problems with this basic set up.Its bog standard. But not me. I knocked down powerpoles,crashed into cars ran over a few , well a lot of people.Flat.Poor old Joe's racer was getting really banged up, it was looking very second hand by this time and had indeed conked out.I had just popped the bonnet and was optomistically about to carry out repairs when a citizen attacked me,throwing punches and screeching.According to him I had run over his wife or his flowerbed possibly both.He was about 85 years old.I was about to punch his lights out when PC Plod and half the city' police force arrived sirens blaring and pistoles drawn. Was fighting the afore mentioned police who were being steadily reinforced whilst my good mate Joe didn't help but yelled half truths about my testicles to the gathering crowd.I wondered if I could come out of this slightly ahead and tried to steal a ladies purse.Nah that didn't work so elected to flee nimbly and the police shot me dead.

The story is very intriguing, worthy of a Martin Scorsese movie, and the gameplay is incredibly entertaining. It has good anf fun missions with a deacent variety, that always pushes the story forward. But the most fun part of the gameplay for me was defenitly the vast, open world with incredible 50s style cars, weapons and surroundings. I must admit that I am a huge fan of mafia stories in general, so I might be a bit biased, but I've had more fun with this open world than I've had with any other game of this type that I can think of (althoug I have yet to try out GTA V).  The game also has a good amount of comedy thrown into the writing, thoug it mostly stays a serious crime drama. There are no major bug that I encounderd during my multiple playthrougs. The gunplay is nothing special but I never really got bored of it, and you get to chose between more guns than you would expect from a 1950s game, with multiple guns, assult rifles and other types of weapons. A molotov cocktail is also always a big bonus in my book.  Combining the deep story that kept you on the edge the entire time with a great payoff with the fantastic shooting/driving gameplay that you would expect from this type of game, it is most certenly a really enjoeble ride that will provide hours of gameplay even after the story is finished throug the open world.  7/10  Feel free to check out my other reviews.

There are 3 'big' DLCs [The Betrayal of Jimmy (was only avaiable in Russia) ] [Jimmy's Vendetta] [Joe's Adventures], and 4 'accessories' DLCs + 1 preorder and deluxe [Made Man] DLC , containing cars, clothes, ...   This game has 3 levels of difficulties : easy, medium and hard. However, for casual players it could be renamed normal, hard, very hard.  This game is a 3rd person free roam type game. It's a GTA like, but in the 50's. The gameplay is interesting, the graphics are great, the 3d models are detailed, and the game has a great optimization and is very fluid. The storyline is quite long, and the main DLC's add a few hours of gaming.  Some of the achievements require intensive grinding. You can probably achieve 100% including DLCs achievement in about 60 hours.    Unfortunately you cant buy it anymore on Steam, but you can use the CD keys from the retail boxed copies, or purchase CD keys online. Buying the Director's Cut edition would provide you all the DLCs minus the Made Man one.  I bought the Deluxe edition a while ago, and I enjoyed playing again recently. I still need to complete some achievements because some are pure grinding. It's a great game at an affordable price, and I would recommend you to get it before it becomes hard to find.",

Graphically it's a beautiful game probably one of the best for its time and it runs great I only had one crash but that was caused by something else outside of the game to cause the game to crash, controsl are easy and gameplay was great the story is fun for the most part but towards the ending it started to feel rushed and then all of a sudden boom it was done. All in all the game was great but the ending was kinda lack luster, I do understand the ending but I don't really like the ending, it would probably make more sense if there was a connection to Mafia 3 but that doesn't look to be the case and now for whatever reason it is not avaiable to buy at this time.  I'll give the game up to towards the ending a 8.5/10 but towards the ending it dropped to about a 5/10 I do recommend it because I think I was just dissapointed in the ending where most people would love the ending.",

The game is very atmospheric and I often find myself roleplaying beyond what the game actually sets up for me. There is also an online mod that is excellent fun.  graphics? in 2015 this game actually hold up very well with a somewhat muted style that lends well to the 2010 graphics. from penny arcade 'it's like walking into a norman rockwell painting and shooting everyone inside'",

            "review_text": "Get this game and the Jimmy's Vendetta DLC, I suggest that DLC because it acts like a sandbox/free ride mode and allows you to save at homes/safehouses. Hours of fun, hectic firefights with destructible objects (The game even comes with PhysX options) and lots of detail. Window panes shatter and shards fly out with each bullet, with wooden chips flying about as they fire at you and miss and hit the wall causing tons of little pieces of wood and plaster to fly off. The aftermath is crazy, floors covered in shards of glass and other debris, bullet holes everywhere and objects torn apart, window blinds swinging slightly in the wind with cop sirens heard in the distance... It's a shame that the main game was relatively linear and only allowed for SOME exploration, but when you're not on a singleplayer mission, the experience of freeroaming is like drinking eggnog after that long wait... The problem is if you die you restart at a checkpoint and there's no safehouse saving so don't expect any GTA stuff right out of the box, you'll have to either buy the Jimmy's Vendetta DLC, Joe's Adventure DLC, or install the working Freeride mod which is not as good as the DLC but it kinda works... You can vault over certain objects and climb onto cars, you can pick the locks of parked cars or just smash their windows which creates some of that fancy PhysX glass shard debris which gets on your hood and falls off nicely as you turn and narrowly make it around the bend to continue your wacky spree. You can become wanted and you have to change your clothing or you'll probably be shot on sight, your current vehicle can also become wanted and you'll have to bail, or just be careful and sneak past the patrolling cruisers and on-foot police officers. There are also gang members that if you gun down one of their buds, nearby gangbangers will retaliate and fire upon you, you can also simply provoke them and get the cops to arrest them while hiding out of sight. You can purchase items from stores and even rob the cash register of 90% of stores except for the 2 special vendors and vehicle modification shops (Which I forgot to mention can remove the wanted variable by changing your plate and repainting your vehicle).  There was also this one store with 2 entrances and big ♥♥♥ windows and you can drive your car through the entire thing, like it was straight out of a film or something. This game features a great story and it was the first time I actually gave a damn about any character's problems (in a game).  It looks just as good as GTA 5, and... IT HAS A PC VERSION!",

I followed this game a lot running up to its release and I ended up being both disappointed and not...  The game should have been longer regarding its story and ambitions. Running towards the end of the game it just felt rushed, like it had to be wrapped up which is a damn shame. The story got both ups and downs, and I would be lying if I said it did not grip me at some point. It's well written but it's everything leading up to the ending and the ending itself that kills it.  It still looks great if you ask me. The only thing that disappointed me when it comes to graphics is the damage on cars is not anywhere near the quality of GTA IV which came out 2 years earlier. The gameplay is pretty good and you're punished if you go for a run and gun tactic. The soundtrack for this game is also one of the best I've ever heard in a game.  Outside the story there's not much for you to do in this open world and that takes away from the experience as well. But if all these things are taken under consideration, then the next game, if there's going to be one could be amazing!  Nevertheless it's a really good experience that I would recommend you if you like me, are fascinated by the mafia.",

All right, let's talk about what's happening for the  Storyline.  It's really amazing, well conflict and kind of reminds me the old 40-50's style. As you continue to progress the story, it gets something very interesting and well beyond... until the end that was surprising (not going to tell you).  The  Voice-Acting  was brilliant and amazing. Especially one of the character voice that reminds me Peter Griffin from Family Guy (Hint: Main Character's best friend).  The  Gameplay  itself is a Free-Roam of the early 50's city. Everything. It focus from late 40's to early 50's style.  Each  Chapter  has a mission for you to do the objectives which quite a bit long story, but you don't have to do it and just free-roam whatever you like if you don't feel like doing it. Unfortunately, there are no Side Missions for each chapter as you progress to move on. For  driving , as soon as you speed up the car, the police will chases after you, but it's quite bit of annoying to lose them. You can turn on the Speed-Limiter in order to maintain the same speed sign like in real life. As soon as you're running low on gas, it will ask you to fill up at the gas station like 'same reference' (or go steal another car, lol). The only little problem are handling that causes steer too much, hitting someone else car that will halt your engine, get out and repair if your car are heavily damaged and chances that hitting someone else will give you wanted on license plate, including yourself. For the  Customization  like Clothing and Cars, it's a good option to set things for yourself what you like, especially you lose the wanted list (for clothing) and license plate as well so you don't get chased by cops again when roaming around while being wanted. For the  Weapons , its pretty cool and unique style. Weapons are no problem with it, nothing bad, but the  fist-fighting  can be bit of awkward. Whether you are facing 1-on-1, you start to move around to get in good position and arm-fist up to cover yourself, but leaned back when the attack commenced.  The  Soundtrack  were great. It feels the developers decided that if they want to put the old songs in the 50's and put into this game, then this could actually work.   Pros:     Amazing Storyline till the end...    Great Voice-Acting for each cast    Free-Roam of the early 50's city    Great Soundtrack like the old 50's day    Weapons are pretty cool and unique style    Clothing and Cars Customization Variety    Cops chases after you for having to speed up the car, but quite bit annoying to lose them. You can turn on the Speed Limiter in order to maintain speed (much like in real life).    Cars has limited gas and must fill it up if running low (same as the above reference).   Cons:     Fist-Fighting can be bit of awkward    Driving can be bit hard to handling, hitting someone else car will cause your car to halt engine and repair yourself if heavily damaged, chances for wanted license plate and list if hitting someone else    No Side Missions, mainly focus on each Chapter Missions    Overall,  I give it 8.5/10 for this game. Don't buy all DLCs as it was worth for nothing, especially 'Jimmy's Vendetta' and 'Joe's Adventure' that was a little bit disappointing. I highly recommended you wait until it goes on sale for 75-85% off as Mafia 3 is coming soon. It's too bad that they didn't put up on steam for the first game. Oh well.",

I followed this game a lot running up to its release and I ended up being both disappointed and not...  The game should have been longer regarding its story and ambitions. Running towards the end of the game it just felt rushed, like it had to be wrapped up which is a damn shame. The story got both ups and downs, and I would be lying if I said it did not grip me at some point. It's well written but it's everything leading up to the ending and the ending itself that kills it.  It still looks great if you ask me. The only thing that disappointed me when it comes to graphics is the damage on cars is not anywhere near the quality of GTA IV which came out 2 years earlier. The gameplay is pretty good and you're punished if you go for a run and gun tactic. The soundtrack for this game is also one of the best I've ever heard in a game.  Outside the story there's not much for you to do in this open world and that takes away from the experience as well. But if all these things are taken under consideration, then the next game, if there's going to be one could be amazing!  Nevertheless it's a really good experience that I would recommend you if you like me, are fascinated by the mafia.",

            "review_text": "I'm sure many people will request someone judge this game based on Grand Theft Auto or a similar game. However that's a mistake. Mafia 2 is NOT a GTA game, while yes there's a world, and you can explore the game as you want at times, this is an extremely linear story, with only one part of the game (A scant ten minutes) which gives you an open ended task. That's 10 minutes of an almost 15 hour game.   A quick note: I was not a fan of the original Mafia. However I was curious about the desire for Mafia 3 so I tried this game out.   That's not to say someone can't compare them, but the point is this is a VERY story driven game. If you're not a fan of Mafia movies, you're probably going to dislike this game. Not only is it heavily based on the same subject, but much of the game is similar to those movies. That's not to say they stole from the movies or anything, but as I played I noticed a number of scenes that feel lifted from Godfather. Hell you have a guy named Vito making his way up.   Then again this story isn't like even GTA Vice City, where the entire game is just a retelling of Scarface, instead there's a very solid and good story that involves a number of interesting characters, and honestly, while you might have an idea where the end of the game is (seriously, mafia stories end only two ways). The game delivers it's story well.  There's no open world component here, even at the end of the game, there's no true free roam. As I said there's 10 minutes of free roam when you need to make a little money. But the majority of the game allows you to explore the city and see everything but there's nothing to do besides the next mission. It's a lovely vibrant city and it's not a huge fault, but if someone's looking for a ton of stuff to do, this isn't the game. If someone instead wants a solid narrative and a story that drives the player forward, well Mafia 2 does that.   I kept playing because I wanted to see the end of the game, and when I was done, I thought I enjoyed it. I'd give this game a 4 stars. That other star. Well let's get into some negatives.   First off I found one almost game breaking bug, in chapter 12, apparently entering a building through one door instead of the other broke the script and that's a pretty major bug, I was ready to give up through frustration before someone mentioned a fix in a thread I read. A fix from 4 years ago! Come on 2k!.   Second we need to talk about collectibles. Let's first talk about the bad. There's wanted posters, and a few of them are near impossible to collect. And there's 159 of them!! Come on! Not only is there too many, but collectibles shouldn't be impossible to get.   On the other hand, there's another collectible. As you play through the story, there's chapters and each chapter has 2-4 playboys. Yes Playboys, you collect the magazine and get a pin up picture. And um, yeah they're old classic pin up photos. To put it simply, it's odd. I mean in a game that has no nudity, even when a character showers, or when there's numerous girls around, there's just porn in the collectibles. WTF? I'm not complaining mind you, it's just a very odd choice. Though making it so you have to collect them as you play through the story was a good design choice in my opinion, it meant you would go near them (For the most part) and have to collect them then, as if you try to grab one in an area you can get to in the wrong chapter, it wouldn't be there.   The gameplay is solid, I've heard people rag about the gunplay, but it's quite good. The difficulty of the game is pretty easy, up til the final chapters, where hard gets ridiculously hard, but medium is almost never a challenge. There's even an option to turn on simulation driving, that did make the car control more realistically. A great addition but I turned it off after a while. It really is nice, but why add difficulty in evading police?   And finally let's talk about the music. I love it, this game has everything, old Italian standards, doo wop, and as the story is told over two decades the music changes with the time. It's a brilliant use of music to push the story forward.   Now I got this game in a humble bundle, I should mention that, but this game made me excited about Mafia 3. When Mafia 3 comes out, I'll be watching because if it can deliver a game, and a story like this one. I won't really have a problem paying for it. As I mentioned earlier, I didn't like Mafia 1 that much, Mafia 2 is a complete 180, I really enjoyed this game. I wouldn't call it love, and I wish people were more upfront about it not being a sandbox/open world game, but besides that, it's a fantastic game, and was well worth the 15 or so hours I put into the main story.   Strong recommend.",

Mafia 2 for me is a gem; I still have it installed from day 1 and still play it on a regular basis; in fact I would say this is the most replayed game that I own and I own a fair few to say the least. The game itself has a great atmosphere which needs to be soaked in to get the most out of it; rush through this game and you will lose the majority it. With a superb orchestral and radio tracklisting adding to the atmosphere of Empire Bay which itself is a beauty to behold.  If you love the main game there are 3 dlc's which are well worth a punt.

On the other, the gameplay was somewhat mediocre due to its dependence upon cover-based shooting. Also, while it is a 'sandbox' game, there isn't actually much to do in the open world. Really, this game is all about its story missions. Why the open world even exists... I don't know. They don't even let you mess around in it after you finish the story like most games of this sort do.  I loved Mafia 1, but that was many years ago. Chances are if I played that again I'd be a bit more negative since that game also had an open world with basically nothing to do in it. Mafia 2, essentially, is Mafia 1 but with a weaker story and nude collectibles. And since I don't care about the latter... ultimately this game was a bit disappointing since my expectations were so high.  Still, this isn't a bad game. I've given 'yes' votes to much worse games than this. Still, I would give this a 'maybe' if I could. If you are interested in a story-driven game in the world of organized crime, then this is probably something to check out.

However, with the release of Mafia 3 not too long away, the game is definitely worth playing again or playing at all for those who have never played it. The story from the outset is engaging and allows you to free roam almost instantly.  One issue I have though is the idea of purchasing items. There are too many times where the story missions cause you to lose all of your items (and I shall not explain why due to spoilers in the game itself) and as a result, it causes you to feel that there is no point what so ever in buying items at all during the story.  However, the graphics, considering the age of the game aren't too bad and the shooting mechanics and the driving mechanics are pretty accurate judging to the time in which the game is set. It doesn't give you the opportunity to get the one shot headshots unless you pre-aim with the retical and even so, you have the chance of missing due to the quality of the weapons in that era. The game itself accurately portrays the era of the 1940s and 1950s and gives you that sense that you're in that era during your time playing the game.  Overall, the story would get an 8/10, graphics a 6/10 and the overall gameplay of the game a 7/10. Definitely worth playing before Mafia 3 hits in November. Another game to play before Mafia 3's release is L.A. Noire, it has similar aspects to Mafia 2 and is set in the same era.",

The graphics look fantastic and have held up very well. I love the open world aspect of the game as well, you can visit many shops for weapons, good eats and some new threads if need be. Police will come after you for the various crimes you commit, starting with just wanting to fine you then shooting you on sight if you fight back. Vehicles handle pretty slugglishly on the normal setting but you change the realism so they actually behave more like a real car at the time, which can make it interesting when evading the police in tight streets filled with traffic. I personally found the melee combat to be clunky and frustrating. Bacsiclly it comes down to timing and clicking the right combinations at the right times. Some of the tougher enemies can be a chore to fight this way. Gunplay was great though and you can use different types of cover while firing upon your enemies. The only other problem I had with this title was the checkpoint system (There's not enought of them in various missions) otherwise it's a great title and well worth playing!",

It's a pretty fun game, with a good story, although the ending with that cliffhanger felt abrupt to me.  It reminds me a lot of L.A. Noire, less crime-solving, more crime-doing. Other than that, for it's price, the game is worth it. Enjoyable and interesting.",

The game's mechanics and gamplay is good enough, but y'know... it isn't something you haven't seen before - which isn't a bad thing by a longshot. Car handling is great and you can get the hang of it, but what was a bit annoying was how you had to leave the speed limiter on so police don't chase you. Immersion? Regardless, the driving is good enough.  The shooting works well and never really had any problems, and you get quite a few weapon slots (but navigating that particular menu/wheel/selection menu is not really that good for mouse and keyboard users, but the problem is gone if you have a gamepad).  While the gameplay is decent, the story is something else. You get to see Vito's life unfold before your eyes, you care about Vito by the end. The supporting characters are also great! The game REALLY has a good atmosphere, and the entire 'Mafia' aspect about it is phenomenal. However, you do some REALLY boring things sometimes like go home to sleep, which was a bit annoying but judging by how fun the overall game was, it was excusable. Also, some timed missions are also a drag.  Anything else to say about the game? Well, the city is completely lifeless... there are no side quests, or anything special to do. And also, the open world isn't accessible through a menu or ANYTHING... you do get to do whatever you want while a mission is going though. The only things you can do is find Playboy magazines (which was a pretty good idea ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) )  However, do I recommend this game? Absolutely. Radio is great, everything is good, I didn't find anything bad or poorly implemented. I just wish there was more to do other than the main story.  Get it on a sale!",

The game takes place in a LOT of different place as the story progresses, as well as taking place in different time periods: from the 1940's to the 50's (I think). I really loved the way the game changed: (without spoilers) when you are 'away' for a few years, everything is different when you come back: the cars are more advanced and faster.  The missions are fun and engaging, with a lot of variation and depth.  I adored the way the police were set out, very unlike GTA where they shoot on site for the smallest things, the punishments the police inflict are much more suited. E.G. If you are caught speeding (You have to be going very fast over the limit for them to pick up on it) you will be fined, same as if you were brawling on the streets or ramming other cars. But say you attack an officer, then they unleash their rage!  The only comaint i have about the game is, there is NO oppurtunity to have fun in the world and explore, yu are always on a mission. I assumed that you would be able to explore at the end, after you had got a lot of money and had a nice house etc. But, alas, no. Yes the ending was very powerful, but the game just ends. When you are in the villa, splash out and have some fun before continuing with the story, as that is proably one of the only times you will have an oppurtunity  Despite the drawback, i would rate this game an 9/10. Brilliant.",

            "review_text": "Decent game. No fundamental flaws but nothing that's amazingly outstanding either. The voice acting was really good, as was the dialogue, though I thought the story was cliched to hell and back - I can't tell if its meant to be an homage to the old Mafia movies we grew up with, or if its blatantly copying from them, but personally it felt like the latter. For most though that's probably perfectly fine, I still have a full stomach of this type of fiction from my teenage years - that's partially where 'Consigliere' comes from - and as such, a lot of the story elements felt cheap, in lack of a better term. It was also very, very predictable, there's a lot of Scorsese storytelling going on which is great but I feel like I've seen this movie a hundred times. It even basically ends the same way as all gangster fiction does, 'I got into this life to get rich and powerful but in the end it cost me more than it was worth' type situation, which is probably faithful to reality but again, I've seen it a hundred times. At least it wasn't a dopey revenge tale like so many of these games tend to be.  I do think the Mafia games possibly have the most intelligent wanted level system I've ever seen for an open-world crime game, its basically the same system from the first game's where the car you're driving can be wanted, but if the police don't have your description (ie haven't seen you outside of the vehicle), you can switch cars and the wanted level is instantly gone no matter how high it is. If they HAVE seen you, all it takes is a change of clothes, or for situations where that isn't plausible, you have a couple of ways to bribe your way out, but its expensive. Or, there is a chance where a cop sees you commit a crime but isn't able to get your description OR your plate number, in which case all you have to do is outrun him for a short period of time. All in all I like how that works, it makes logical sense and practical sense, not just one or the other like in, say, Grand Theft Auto. The Police AI is a crapload better than the first game too, cops will actually stop crimes committed by NPCs now (or attempt to). It was really kinda bad in the first game, as I remember it.   ts still not perfect, I can get fined for speeding or crashing into cars, but I can drive on the sidewalk and run redlights and cops don't give a flying ♥♥♥♥; if you're going to implement traffic laws then go all the way, or just leave it out (which would've been my preference). You also can run out of gas, and there are gas stations to refill at, but I never once ran out of fuel except when trying to do a specific achievement and even if I had I would've just stolen another ride, so that's another mechanic I could do without. I remember there being a licensed Godfather game for the PS2, I feel like this game could've copied some of the gameplay tropes from it, such as territory wars, or extorting individual businesses, etc would've benefitted it greatly, but it also admittedly would've distracted from the 'cinematic experience', which is something this series is all about having (moreso the first game though). Also despite the presence of public transportation, there's no means of fast travel, that disappointed me.  I got this as a part of the Humble Bundle, the 2K bundle that several of us partook in (and honestly had no expectation that I'd ever pick this up before that sale, I liked the first game in its time but that time was long ago); having paid around $8 for all those games, I think this is a good (not great) experience. If I'd paid $60 or even $30, however, I think I'd be a lot more critical; perhaps that's the best review I could give, in that sentence.",

The story is great and is pushed along nicely by some incredible voice work and a very capable script. You become attached to the characters on screen and the main cast all have their own personalities and quirks which helps make them feel more real.   Gameplay wise it's solid but simple, there's a basic cover system and a fighting mechanic which lets you punch the *bleep* out of your foes, sadly there are no melee weapons though which would have been great. The enemy AI for the most part are very smart and will often cover each other and try to flank you, sometimes they're even a little too quick off the draw as they come flying around a corner and instantly blow your head clean off, this is an area where Mafia II greatly surpasses the much newer Mafia III where enemies seem more than happy to stand around while you butcher their friends. You'll spend a lot of time driving your car and you have the option to play with simulation or arcade controls, personally I preferred arcade. Regardless as to which you pick cars handle well and the driving portion of the game feels more than fine.   Another huge plus is the audio which is just fantastic, I've already commented on the voice work which is superb but the game also has a massive library of music from the era which really makes long car rides more enjoyable as you tap your foot along to the tunes.   Visually it's still very nice 6 years later, it completely holds up and honestly looks better than some games that released much later, and you'll have no trouble hitting a solid 60fps on modern hardware as well so gameplay feels smooth and responsive at all times.   There are a couple of niggles though, one being the lack of unique character models for lesser characters, when you get to a certain part of the game this becomes highly noticeable when everyone of the same race has the exact same model, it's very jarring, I wonder how long it would have taken to add some beards or something just to make them a little different. Another, more annoying issue is the extremely harsh checkpoint system, dying for any reason can mean some lengthy backtracking and it really did frustrate me at times, you can't manually save so you're at the mercy of the game and you're going to die even on medium difficulty so I'm sure most people will experience some frustrating due to this during their first playthrough.   Overall I highly enjoyed Mafia II (again) and I recommend it to anyone, especially when it's on sale which it regularly is for £4.99. The DLC is not worth it, though.",

            "review_text": "Mafia II is an action-adventure video game developed by 2K Czech and published by 2K Games. The game is the direct sequel to 2002's Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven. Set within the fictional Empire Bay (based on New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles, Boston and Detroit, the story follows a gangster and his efforts to climb through the ranks of the Mafia crime families. The game is played from a third-person perspective and its world is navigated on-foot or by vehicle. You take control Vito Scaletta, a war veteran who becomes caught up with the Mafia when trying to pay back his father's debts.   The game is set in the 1940s - early 1950s era of Empire Bay, a fictional city based on New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles, Boston and Detroit. There are 30-40 vehicles in the game (45 with downloadable content) as well as licensed music from the era. Many firearms from the previous game return, such as the Thompson submachine gun and Colt 1911, as well as a pump-action shotgun. New World War II-era weapons like the MP 40, the M3 submachine gun, the MG 42 and the Beretta Model 38 also appear in the game. Interacting with objects in the environment involves two action buttons- a standard action and a 'violent' action (for example, when stealing a car, the player may choose to either pick its lock or break the window glass), used in context-sensitive situations.   A map is included as in the original Mafia game, but the checkpoint system has been completely overhauled New controls include a cover system that allows you to take cover behind objects (such as generators, walls and large crates) and shoot enemies, rather than just entering an arbitrary crouch pose behind them. The game's cutscenes are created by the game engine in real-time. For example, if you're riding in a car and a cut scene starts, you will be driving the same car with the same condition (damaged or intact) and you will also be wearing the same clothes.   This game is just phenomenal both of the main characters are well fleshed-out and memorable, and the story just comes to an end in an original but shocking manner. Overall I think Mafia II really is a huge improvement over the first game. I highly recommend this game it is just absolutely fantastic there is just so much you can do in the game that you will never get bored. The story is very interesting and fun to play through, the world of Empire Bay is very detailed and has a realistic feel to it. If you're a fan of The Godfather, I am 100% sure that you will love Mafia II just as much!.",

At start, you may feel that the driving mechanics in particular are fairly clunky and the game seems as if it is going nowhere, but give it an hour and you'll be thrown into excitement and the fun will really begin. The voice acting is amazing and the cutscenes are perfectly delivered.   My only complaint was the way that the checkpoint system could be frustrating, with checkpoints being very far apart, meaning that you might have spent 10 minutes doing something, died and then went all the way back to do the thing that took you 10 minutes to do. It doesn't ruin the game, but it often makes you frustrated enough to close the game for a while, which is not good.   It's a great game, overall and the flaws are very minor.

        {
            "review_text": "The chronic oversaturation of the mafia in our international media has taught us much. Mafia II is an attempt to chronicle these teachings in game form. Fact number one: mafia men do lots of killing. Fact number two: they like suits. Fact number three: mafiosa don't call each other mafiosa; they use the term 'wiseguys'.  I've cross-referenced facts one and two with Mafia II, and they're definitely right – a lot of killing and a lot of suits. Fact number three isn't. 'Wiseguys', with its implied streetsmarts and cunning, doesn't fit Mafia II's mobsters. It certainly doesn't fit the mid-level gangster the game asked me to tail early in its middle act, who didn't have the presence of mind to check his rearview mirror as he drove away from a literal hatchet job. Had that guy done so, he'd have seen Sicilian-born WWII veteran and new-boy mobster Vito Scaletta about 20 feet behind, dressed in a red and white cod- Hawaiian shirt, driving a hot pink corvette with 'BUMS12' proudly displayed on the numberplate. That guy was not very wise.  The other guy was me, and I was trying to be too wise. As Mafia II's protagonist, my first attempt to trail the escaping mobster ended in failure after my original car choice – an inconspicuous '50s saloon – was outpaced with ease on the motorways. I only chose that car, snatched unattended with a bit of pavement minigame lockpicking, to satisfy the mission briefing, which said my mark would notice anything too obvious. Dutifully I wrested against the vehicle's slightly clunky era-specific handling to try and keep pace. But after my AI target had pranged his own vehicle six times against anything and everything in his path, I realised that such forwardthinking wiseguyishness wasn't entirely necessary on my part.  That Mafia II so effectively harpoons its illusion of real life, showing its characters to be machines acting out prescribed paths, is to its detriment. But the fact that I bought into it in the first place is the game's greatest strength.  It's not that Vito is a sympathetic character. Returning from a war he held no moral stake in – after a botched robbery, it was that or prison – he joins the local mafia, even though his mum told him not to. Naughty. From there on, he relies upon menace through the typical mafioso triple-threat: punching, shooting, and scary staring. Best buddy Joe occasionally dips a toe into 'comic relief' territory, but then ducks back into 'just a bit nasty' land, gets his pistol and shoots everyone in comic relief territory. Those poor clowns.  The player's supporting cast eschews any chance to get really creative, instead furnishing the game with another layer of dark-suited, dark-haired professionals, hitmen and higher-ups that blur into one mass. Driven by his need for money and respect, Vito is encased in a series of ever-widening shells, each step up the mafia ladder (a ladder made of guns) giving a new set of faces to watch in cutscenes: but they're all congealed clichés, culled from a hundred Bronx Tales and Godfathers. The dialogue is wellwritten and excellently acted, but it feels mechanical, the spoutings of a supercomputer sat in a shady office with its dials set to 'lightly-accented macho threat.'  It was the city that drew me in. An amalgamation of New York's streets and Hollywood's hills, Empire Bay is as interactively sterile as all other 'open-world' game-cities, but it's been coated in a veneer of dreamy credibility. Each street and hallway has a feature – a man shouting at an open window; a woman pressing her ear to a door; the sound of an argument. It's easy to see these details written down in a design document, but it gives Empire Bay a genuine rhythm, a pulse that Liberty City lacks. Plus, it helps that it is – on hefty machines – stunning. Turn up in the city in winter, and the streets are caked in snow, with layered bands of crystalline white on the untrodden paths contrasting with slush on the roads. And the lights! Even as the game transitions out of the 1940s and into the '50s, Mafia II's waxy lighting remains consistently arresting, casting pools of gold and yellow on windscreens.  But there's no point to any of it. The city breathes and grows, changing as the missions span the years, but it never moves or cries out. The game is presented in chapters, and each chapter has you wake up in your home. Vito, I can inform you, is a man who sleeps in the same vest and pants for nine years. Before the poor, smelly bugger can even get dressed, he's hit with news and a job. The game forces you to drive to a location: once there, Vito either shoots some men, punches some men or drives to another location.  As their cheery local mafia man, I'd pop in to see my contacts. Need any guys whacking today? Anything nicked? Want me to punch a lady? I was good at all these things. But, always, no. To deviate from the missions just wastes time: you can rob shops, but won't procure much loot; you can pester civilians, but will only get police pressure. For a city dripping with incidental detail, the game slapped on top of it has none. Not that this is a mechanical problem – 2K Czech have never made any bones about Mafia II being a linear experience – but when the city itself looks so inviting, it's a shame you can't do more.  Unless you make your own fun, that is. I enjoyed people-watching in a city where every pedestrian and car driver has the situational awareness of a frightened rabbit. Drive near one of the AI humans on foot and their preset reactions kick in, launching them in a seemingly random direction. Sometimes, this would be toward safety; more regularly, they'd hurl themselves into speeding traffic.  Having a woman – a few moments earlier happily strolling down a sunny street – chuck herself in front of a nearby van is certainly a surprise. Having that van then swerve to try to avoid her and plough through another three pedestrians is brilliant. Having that van then be spotted by a police car, having those police open fire before getting squished by the panicky, blood-leaking van driver, is better than another cover-shooting 'kill 50 goons' story mission.  And those are too regular. Combat is supported by a pleasing system of gunplay that leads to weighty, inaccurate firefights heavily reliant on ducking behind cover. The enemy AI – so stupid at the wheel - doesn't redeem itself through Mafia II's battles. Bad guys just pop up and down from the same spots of cover like sharply dressed moles: whacking them is simply a matter of waiting. Early in the storyline, Mafia II displays a convincing unwillingness to murder indiscriminately, surmising that the repeated and wholesale murder of swathes of humanity isn't the mafia's major focus. This was the time I built my connections, prepared my lip for wobbling when my contacts became friends and my friends went to sleep with the fishes, as all mafia friends do. But then, three quarters of the way through, it forgets all that, and puts you up against waves of baddies, dehumanised after all that work to build Empire Bay's factions into tangible things.  Mafia II is a mafia movie run once through a game grinder, and that's simultaneously the worst thing about the game and the compliment it was developed for. In telling a story as convincing as most Hollywood depictions of the Cosa Nostra, 2K Czech have accomplished exactly what they intended to: only at the end does the artifice topple slightly, piling one too many game-cliché mass-battles onto the pile. But detach the story from its very familiar housings, and we're not left with much: a bit of walking, a lot of driving and too much shooting. Each is good, but rarely superb.  Even supported by a neat script and great voicework, Mafia II is treading ground already chewed up by cinema's very best. On that level, it can't compete. 80/100",

Still, I'm going to give my opnion on mafia 2 based on this vague memory.  In short, it was a little disapointing... Now don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed my time with mafia 2 which took me around 18 hours to finish on hard difficulty (althugh 2 - 3 of those might be afk time) but it just felt so ... incomplete. From the moment you start the game you are being sent from one mission to the other without the game giving you a single story-justified break to roam around the city and see what is has to offer, yet upon getting a little deeper into the game you realize that this is probably due to the fact that other than the story, there is pretty much nothing to do. or at the very least nothing that would make you feel like it was worth doing.  In terms of story mafia 2 has a pretty good story and I enjoyed playing through it.  in terms of combat mafia 2 has some improvment over mafia 1. The shooting mechanics feels pretty much like mafia 1 only now you also have a cover mechanic. For hand to hand combat the developers made some boxing mode and while this addition is nice it is far from realizing it's potential. Oh, there are also no more meele weapons so that sucks.  In terms of cars the game feels pretty underwhelming with not as much vehichles as I remember mafia 1 having and cars seemingly not being a very significant part of the game, which is wierd since car customization is better than what mafia 1 had (if memory serves). Basically, the repair shops now let you change your car's color, tiers and lisence plates in addition to being able to fix it or even tune it's engine for better preformance. They also give you a private garage to store your cars in with room for up to 10 cars. In the garage you can browse the cars you have and view various statistics about each individual car as well as it's damage status. The problem with all of these 'cool' new things is that yet again they feel incomplete and instead of adding to the richness of the game they just remind you how much more &amp; better it could have been.  Driving feels ok-ish but the camera can get frustrating. yet another incomplete feeling feature.  The story itself sometimes feels a little umm, ... ahem, wierd... in how it portrays killing and death as a 'big deal' in the cutscenes compared to the massive amout of it that you do while you play.  Free roaming, as you might have understood by now is boring, pointless and empty.   Despite all of the negatives above, mafia 2 is a nice gangster story driven game with fun shooting gameplay and some driving parts in between. If that is what you want than I recommend that you get the game once it's on sale.  Otherwise, If you were looking for some free roaming pleasure go get it elsewhere.",

Each chapter brings something new and fresh, and unlike LA Noire the game isn't slowed down by tedious investigatios or logic. You still need to drive everywhere though, and there's no fast-travel either--lame. Don't bother stockpiling weapons or money, you lose it every third or fourth chapter. You keep the cars though, so that's always a plus, not that it's difficult to just lift one off the street.   Civilian AI will run directly in front of your car unless you obey all traffic laws which only makes the tedious driving all the more insufferable. Pick up a pizza and chow down while you're playing this game for the full Italian effect.",

            "review_text": "Highly recommended, but only for 50s fans.  Mafia II is a very barebones attempt at a GTA game. Don't get me wrong, the gameplay is fun and the story is great, but outside of the main campaign, there literally is not a single other mission in the game. The city is small, and contains only robable shops and illegitimate car salesmen in the way of economy or distractions. The freeride mode from Mafia 1 is even absent, though it's relatively easy to mod back in.  In no small words: After you beat the campaign, you're going to have to make your own fun in order to get your money's worth. This is where people are going to be split on the game.  Mafia II takes place in the 1940s and 50s (different sections of campaign, but the freeride mod lets you play both at your leisure). Currently, it is one of only two 1950s GTA shooters on the market, and one of only a small handful of 1940s GTA shooters. It's absolutely riddled with anachronisms in either setting, but the atmosphere is undeniable.  The root of this game is the unique experience of driving a T-Bird through a detailed, beautiful 1950s cityscape with oldies blasting out of your radio. It's an experience that I loved, and it's why I can say Mafia II gave me my money's worth. However, I can see how it's a bit too limited for some.  If you're not a fan of this kind of atmosphere, you should still buy it when it's on sale just to experience the great campaign. But if you're a huge 50s fan like me just looking for a game to suit your needs, this is the best you'll get.",

You play the role of Vito an Italian/American who with his buddy Joe takes his shot at becoming a Made man in the Mafia.  I can't really say much about the story without giving big spoilers but lets just say it gives us an excellent look at how life in the mob would actually be. I always wanted to play a game version of Goodfella's and Mafia II is just that.   + Graphics still hold up today. The character models and expressions are great.   + Old 50's music, i personally love the period and setting.   + The Story has so many twists and turns, its better than many movies. Keeps you playing to see what happens.  + The gameplay is also fantastic, its unforgiving unlike many shooters you need to use cover or you die.  - It comes to an end a little after 10 hours.

I have no Idea why you cant buy it on steam but, A little FYI you can go to  ♥♥♥♥♥♥.com  and buy the steam key if you want this game. and you should do it. great controls, good story line, great game. And to the idiot kids that gave this game a bad review because they think its a GTA wanna be, a little history lesson for you gta is not the original open world shooter game. The first Mafia was raleased in 2002, funny that was the same year GTA III was released. although Mafia was released in July as GTA III was in August. So .......... yeah. Bottom line buy this game. one flaw I have realized is random parts in the game the performance drops from 80fps to 60fps on 4k ultra settings but, still worth the $5 this game costs on ♥♥♥♥♥♥.

I was playing on a solid 60fps for a good while, but after a couple of chapters, the game started to have minor FPS drops, they are really quick (and farely rare), like only a half a second long when the frames drop to the 20's or 30's and then climb back to the normal level. I'm not the only one who suffers of this same problem (Google 'Mafia 2 frame-rate drops'). Fortunately this 'issue' doesn't make Mafia II unplayable - it's just a minor setback in this awesome game on PC/Steam (Mafia II was also published on PS3 and Xbox 360).",

NOTE: I'm going to try to do some minor spoiler/spoiler free reviews, and this is my first attempt.  Plot: You play as Vito Scaletta, who recently got back from home after an injury from WW2. Throughout the game, you do some small time jobs, and eventually get tied into the mafia. Then after a job, someone rats you out and you're sent to jail. But you get out of jail early from a friend you met while in prison. Then you do more mafia jobs, but you then find out that you have to kill all the mafia members. You do, and the game ends with a cliffhanger.  Gameplay: It's your standard sandbox game. You drive cars, you go to missions, you take cover, the usual stuff. Only it's the 1940's. And you have a more in-depth police system. But that's about it.  Replayability: There isn't much else to do after the game ends. Except for maybe finding all the playboy magazine photos scattered throughout the world.  Verdict: 7.5/10 It's a fairly decent game, but nothing too special. Still a good game though.",

It left me wanting more, but also left me with a feeling that I had exactly enough. Kind of like the feeling you get when you finish a really good meal, and you've had just enough that you do want more, that you'd come back another time. And you end up never coming back, and it becomes just a good memory. See ? I hope nobody will make other mafia games for a long time. I'll take that one expansion, but I'm not going to want anything more after that, simply because I know it would be just the same : double-crossing all the time, car chases and gun fights, immoral stuff and characters with italian accents, and I've had perfectly enough of it (in a good way). I wouldn't want to ruin this happy feeling. :)) This game did a perfect job, and I very highly doubt any other game will ever top this one, at least for a long time, in terms of action-oriented mafia games like this one here.  Now some people might argue that the map is not big enough, that the sandbox in this game is not that good. I do agree in a way; If you are someone that just likes to mess around in a sandbox, then I suppose that game is not for you, but if you want an excellent story, excellent pacing, excellent gameplay, perfectly reproduced mafia setting, etc etc, this one is for you. Personally, I felt the sandbox was there just enough so that it wouldn't draw you too far away from the story that you'd end up losing interest in the story. There could have been more sandbox elements, but it wasn't pushed onto the player, and it was good like that.  I do have one thing to say about the sandbox though. Sometimes the game is unforgiving; you have lots of stuff, you lose it, and then it auto-saves. Now getting back into business and making some cash might not be too hard, but it's quite... boring (i.e. the sandbox is kind of boring). I wish they'd put side-quests that would have tied-in to the story and to the character progression... But I can't say I missed those a lot, if at all. I had to rob a few cars (and sell them for parts) to get back in business and it was just... a bit long and monotonous. I did get back on my feet quickly, but still, more side-quests, readily available at key locations, would have been very welcome - these would have been the cherry on an already perfect cake. (unless I missed them ?)",

The 50s is a fantastic era, one that has mesmerized me for pretty much my entire life. Everything about it seems incredible and this game just makes it seem that more incredible. This game is just brilliant, one of the greatest games of all time in my opinion, especially open world at least. There aren't a lot of mafia orientated games, and there aren't a lot of open-world games set in the 50s and this is like a dream come true for me. A must buy, only one thing I have to say which disappoints me is the price, £20 for a game thats 4 years old is ridiculous.

I love the change of the seasons within the story mode, and the attention to detail. They missed out on including the Free Ride feature from the original Mafia, but the overall look and feel of the game is top quality. The makers simply needed to focus on designing the game to meet the gamer's mindset, without forcing them to consider spending $10 on an expansion that may or may not bring them more gaming satisfaction.

You don't have to wait until you're in a combat situation to be able to pull them out like with most games. Pull a 1911 out on an old lady on the street? Go on ahead.

This game caught me COMPLETELY off guard when it came out. I was not expecting it to be as good as it was. You play as Vito Scaletta who joins the Mob life thanks to the help of his friend in a 1940s city. You will be shooting, driving fighting and even getting involved in a few sneaking sections to get through the game. What keeps the game going is the story which constantly gives you context to keep playing through the game, similar to what TV shows do to keep them addictive. The game's story is absolutely stellar and always gives you a good enough reason to keep playing. There is also a very good hint of realism which I loved and also helped keep the game fun and addicting to get through.   The game also gives you plenty of opportunities to explore and go to shops to purchase guns and clothing to make your character look badass. The shooting is also solid and the game feels like one giant interactive movie. And I absolutely love it. I cannot reccomend this game enough. I LOVE IT. I'm not going to spoil the game, just know that the story is amazing and the mechanics, while not the best in the world, do work and work well with the game and it's story.  Can the same be said about Jimmy's Vendetta though? Unfortunately, no. This DLC was boring. Very boring. It actually highlights how good the story is, but also highlights that the game's mechanics on their own are actually not that brilliant. All the missions involve going to the mission point (which can sometimes be on the other side of the map), going to point A, kill someone, steal something, blow something up and/or fight someone, drive to point B and do it all again, sometimes while trying to avoid the police. Every mission was like this and there is no story surrounding the missions so things get very dull very fast. Also you have a lot less health in this than you did in the base game, and since there is no checkpoint system, you end up having to replay missions all over again including the tedious driving which tells you off whenever you try to speed which can frustrate you alongside bore you. I only played about 20% of this DLC content before getting bored and frustrated and turning it off. DO NOT BUY THIS DLC, it is not worth it. Also, the ending mission is the same thing again and the ending itself is about 30 seconds long. Yeah, don't bother.  What about Joe's Adventure's? Well, if you are reading this now, I am still playing through this DLC pack, however this review will be updated once I have completed it.",

If you really want to freeroam and do more jobs in this game, you could buy the joe's adventures DLC, but I personally didn't like it. I was hoping it would be sort of like the actual game with an extra story, but it was like an arcade game where you had to earn points.

I personally like this game, it's sorta like being the badass gangster who brings guns and shoots people at alleyways and stuff. Vito Scaletta has a good character. But this game's pro is probably it's AI, gunfight gameplay, and it's way of telling stories. Like I said, the AI's good. People on cars would avoid your cars and not crash you and your car, not like GTA. I'm giving it a 9.5/10 for having a bad save system and short story.",

            "review_text": "Considering this game is over 3 years of age the graphics in Mafia II are just as good as some games being released now. The crisp detail of the buildings, cars, even the music choice and people of Empire Bay really sets the tone for the 1940s and 50s. The way everything is laid out really makes you want to go back to that time period and just live in a place like Empire Bay. This brings me to give Mafia II a smashing 9/10 for aesthetics.  The gameplay in Mafia II isn't shabby either, infact it's far from it! With the amazing era-specific driving and the amazing (yet limited) gun choice makes the city a fun place to be. Every mission is different, unlike many games related to the Mafia and such there is no repetition. You never know what to expect when playing this game. Playing as Vito Scaletta as he rises and falls within the ranks of the mob with his bestfriend Joe Barbaro with him just makes you want to be there with them. It's just great fun! Due to the fact it lacks freeroam once completed it sadly brings Mafia II down to 9/10.  For value Mafia II is great. When it first ame out it was, you guessed it £40, but 4 years later it's around £20. Playing through 15 chapters may not seem like a lot, but it really is. The amount of gameplay the hides within those chapters is simply amazing! Therefore value gets 10/10 from me!  Overall Mafia II gets 10/10. As one of my favourite games ever it never fails to keep me occupied. I bought it the day it came out on Xbox and I still play it to this day on PC. Some of my friends question me about how I can still play it 4 years on and I simply say 'How can I not still play it?' and that's that. If someone came to me and asked a good game to play the first one I would recommend this one first.  I hope that this review is helpful to people and helps you find what you are looking for!",

The game had so much potential and at the time was most likely a very big leap forward but in todays standards of which I played it, it made me feel wanting. THe missions are nearly all the same, drive somewhere,shoot waves of people then drive home and sleep. The progression in the game gives you no real freedom, you can go around and rob shops or crush cars for cash but by the end of the chapter you're playing you will lose all your guns and money because one of your misdeeds places you in jail or you fall over and bump your knee causing all your money to dissapear, there is literally no point in doing any side activities as doing missions will just lose you all the progress you make. Speaking of side activities that leads me to another point, Choice. This game gives an idea that there is choice in your actions and deeds, that they may have some affect on what happens or what will, however this is just an illusion, early in the game you will aquire Lockpicks and are given the notion that these will be indispensable to you in the game, howevere you only use them a couple of times and while you can use them for stealing cars it just makes so much more sense to simply press Q rather than taking your time lockpicking to no added benefit and rather increasing the chance the police will catch and arrest you. *SPOLIERS*Later in the game you will be told that an old friend of yours is going to be assasinated as he goes against the 'family' you currently work for, with no choice you are forced to go make him aware and when you arrive to his house you have to find a hiding place of which there are numerous, but in all but one you will be found and it will just lead to the same situtaion as it would be if you escaped.  Pros- -Fun Driving/Drift Mechanics -I got to learn that Vito is the most popular word in Empire Bay -The shotgun is the most fun weapon I have ever used in this sort of Game  Cons- -Little to no choice -NO real Freeroam -Progress is basically wiped every chapter -Shooting mechanic is pretty bad -Health system is like COD on speed(Bloody screen, so real) -DLC is terrible -Pretty much no characther progression",

But I feel pranked about the way the *hrmpf* 'characters' and story are designed &amp; told - did the developers think the players are a bunch of dumb ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bags who accidentally bought Mafia II instead of a CoD (at least CoD is funny and enjoyable hence it's so honestly cheap)? Of course there are some awesome action plots and lovely side characters, but it's the exception.  The gameplay itself is kind of fun, but since strongly bound to story missions (which would be fine if the storytelling wouldn't be so lifeless but a rotten cliche-zombie without heart) you'll know every enemy's location et cetera if you replay the game or a mission. Everything feels like a script and you have to act and do exactly like the director wants you to do.  After all it definitely doesn't beat Mafia I or any GTA game and even the Saints Row series possesses more immersive characters and plot lines and a more interesting gameplay. Please check out a Let's Play first and if you can feel any atmosphere and don't mind neither linear missions nor totally desperate storytelling about lifeless cliches, it's worth a shot.

In other words, if you dont mind JUST a story game with virtually no side missions that will progress only how the game wants you to progress, this isn't a bad game at all. 30 bucks US? Hell no. 10 bucks? maybe. But even then, dont expect anything more exciting than you'd get out of a point and click 'adventure' game. 5/10  Oh yeah, and they omitted one of the best aspects of the original: mafia family turf wars. they were a lot like gta san andreas' gang turf wars. The only reason I kept going with the game to begin with is I was anticipating the turf wars. HUGE let down.

Sure, it looks a lot slicker and there are some nice touches to it like the vehicle physics and the shops (car and character customisation) but it could have been so much better and there are some glaring issues I just can't agree with.  My main issues now after finishing the first run through of the story: NO FREEROAM!!! Unbelievable how this can have been left out. I mean the city is not particularly immersive in the first place but there is NO option to explore outside the storyline. This is unforgiveable. TOO EASY, even on the hardest setting there is little challenge. Only a few hours of play. STORYLINE, just not well thought out. Its not believable. The character makes odd choices that just leave me scratching my head going 'what an idiot' Its too hard to have any empathy for him. VEHICLES. Not enough, and far too many that dont even fit in the time period! Its made clear to you at the start of the mission what day and year it is, then you walk outside and get into a car that doesn't exist for another half of a decade.  THE MAP. Its pretty limited. Its not big, and the landmarks kind of annoy me. If its supposed to be set in New York, then fine, make the map resemble it at least vaguely and dont stick things in it from other cities like L.A. If its not supposed to be New York, Then don't stick the Brooklyn Bridge and the Empire State building in the middle of it. It just seems to give the city a tiny bit of identity (which is pointless) when the rest doesnt live up to it. A generic North Eastern city would have been easier to accept, without the landmarks.  Theres a lot of small details that annoy me too. Controllers?. Didn't detect my G27, could't get it working. In this day and age this shouldn't even be an issue. You can't drop an empty weapon, for example during firefights you can find your self with a shotgun, 2 tommy guns, an MP40, a grease gun, a 45, a magnum, and a .38, half of them are out of ammo and you have to cycle back and forth through the menu vainly searching for something to shoot back with. Also unfortunately there is no first person driving view. Multiple camera angles but none from inside the cabin.   Mafia 2 might be worth a punt if you find it on sale, but £30 for the digital deluxe verion is daft. The little DLCs are a bit annoying too as they clutter up your garage with unwanted vehicles you cant get rid of.  Honestly, I wouldn't bother with this. Its disappointing. I don't think I will get much use out of this now I have completed the story. I wouldn't say its a waste of money. But if I could get my money back, I would.",

            "review_text": "An interesting game that while not being awful, I cannot recommend. Mafia 2 has a decent story, graphics and gameplay, but after the first few missions it quickly devolves into repetitive gunfights and long, boring drives from 1 place to another. The open world does nothing to improve the game, and while it looks very impressive, there is no soul and nothing to do outside of the main missions. It serves simply as a means to get from location to location without sharp transitions. Do not go in expecting a GTA style open world. The story and characters are really the only thing that makes this game worth playing. Joe and Vito are characters I wanted to spend more time with, although if you've seen any mafia-style movie, you'll know exactly where the story is going. It's also got an unsatisfying ending that seemed placed just to set up a sequel. Ultimately I cannot recommend you buy Mafia II, but if you get it in a bundle or get it for free you should at least try it, you might like it.",

            "review_text": "So after finishing Mafia 2 i am just like most people should be.. Disapointed..    There will be mild spoilers in this review so do no read it if you care about this ♥♥♥♥ game.    I bought and installed this game mentally preparing to play the story of a man joining the mafia..  The game starts out great you get to follow Vito before he started out as a criminal and then into his first jobs. As usual in all theese kinds of games like GTA etc etc you start with simple jobs that make you feel like an errand boy.. The problem in Mafia 2 is that that feeling never goes away.   Through out all the missions they tried to make Vito like hes not taking sides which removes the option from the player to decide what kind of gangster he wants to be, if i wana be the fair gangster just making his dough i should be able to but if i want to be the crazy lunatic gangster killing everyone i want that choise as well..  NOTE:  I didn't expect to get to make choises in this game but i did expect not for Vito to be ♥♥♥♥ing apathetic. Just watch the player models facial expression throughout the whole game it just makes me wana end his misery.. And while your friend Joe brings the game up by making funny jokes Vito is always the booring character that slows the game down, he is not sure of anything he doesnt know what he wants and he looks dumb.   Another really stupid thing in this game is the ♥♥♥♥ing Melee system.. Right from the start in the first few missions it feels like the game developers are preparing you to become a ♥♥♥♥ing boxing champion.. I bought this game to use guns not to become the next rocky balboa.. And thats not enough they made a whole chapter in the game just about boxing.. almost ♥♥♥♥ing uninstalled in the middle of that one. Psst!! Its the one were vito is in prison.  Hold on i feel like im about to puke right here before the next segement...  Okay so enough with the bad story, now lets get to the awesome game mechanics.. Im basically all games there is a linear system for how things work, for example in earlier GTAs you go into the circles to start a mission and in newer ones a cutscene starts when you reach a checkpoint. In Mafia 2 they got the GREAT idea to switch it up EVERY MISSION!!! WHoah!!! nice!   While some of you reads this and think for yourself well thats not a big deal?.. Well i can take some examples.. First there is a mission were you have to sell stolen gass stamps before midnight so you travel to different gass stations selling the stamps, here the information that you can stop your car next to the gasstation and sell them straight from the car is non existent, that basically if you dont have ninja reflexes and see the small 0.01s tooltip hit the screen you will miss and go out of your car and sell them like i did the first time and fail the entire mission. Then we have some other time trial missions were you have to save some old guy from being killed by the snitch Harry.. That almost made me go ♥♥♥♥ign insane, here you have to go to this guys house on a very short period of time, Harry takes your car so you just have to be lucky to find one parked outside the resturaunt. When you have done that you have to drive like a maniac praying to every god there is that you do not get the cops after you. When you finally arrive at the old guys house you have like 10 seconds or something left on the clock you think like yeah, ♥♥♥♥.. i made it..! Well think twice the game just ♥♥♥♥ed you again!! you have to go out of the car and into the old guys house this time :D:D:D: !! Very nice..   And then i will skip talking about the random times the games take over your character / car and controls if for you randomly when you go to a checkpoint.  I am 100% sure that everyone who plays this game will a few times during their playthrough get ♥♥♥♥ed by this ♥♥♥♥ed up system of theirs.  But lets throw all that bad stuff aside and look at the Pros of the game .   PROS:     Joe (Your friend in the game) makes funny jokes.    Their collectible system is based on playboy magazines so you can pause and masturbate between rage.    The game is about 10-12 hours long so you wont waste too much of your life.   EDIT: I forgot to talk about the stupid AI but you will notice that yourself when you drive like a regular citizen and some random chineese guy jumps infront of your car and suddenly you have 4 stars and cops want to kill you.  EDIT 2: If you decide to downvote you might as well comment on this review tell me what you disagree with.  Best Regards Life of Pablo",

Here's a quick breakdown of what you'll be doing: cutscene, drive, cutscene, drive, shootout, cutscene, drive, drive, cutscene, drive. It seems all you do in this game is drive from cutscene to cutscene, which wouldn't be bad if the story was compelling in the least, but it wasn't. I didn't give two ♥♥♥♥♥ about Vito or any part of his life, which is a shame, because the voice work, atmosphere, and look of the game are incredible. They did do a couple neat things, though, and as you'd guess, they all revolving around driving. You can run out of gas, get pulled over for speeding, take health damage (and possibly die) if you get in a bad enough accident.. all things that make sense and bring another level of realism to virtual driving. However, this is all squandered once you realize the police in this game are absolutely useless. Got caught speeding or running over a civi? Stop your car, wait for the police to get out of theirs, then take off. That's all it takes to ditch the cops. And there goes all the tension of running out of gas during a high speed chase. Or worrying about trying to drive under the speed limit. Because it doesn't matter. The cops may as well not even be there.  ALSO. If you're an achievement ♥♥♥♥♥, beware. There are three separate collectible achieves in this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. THREE. Collect all 50 Playboys, drive 30 of 36 cars, and find 150 wanted posters. That's nearly 250 different things to find. Whack. Totally and utterly whack. And this whackness doesn't even factor in the DLC achieve which involves driving 1k miles- an estimated 10 hours of time.

What I personally found the absolute most irritating was    that you lose your cash 2 times in the game, as scripted with no way to stop this    .

Now the drawbacks are that without DLCs feels like it's an incomplete game, outside of the story there is nothing interesting to do, you can take cars to Bruski or rob shops, but other than that, nothing serious. The story is rather short, they could include some side quest, something other than shoot and fight missions, and there are too much cutscenes, yes, the cutscenes are good, but I think there are as much cutscenes as gameplay and fights are.

There's another cop right around the corner who recognizes you from the previous recognition of the cop you just saw on the previous corner. MAKES TOTAL SENSE GUYS!! And there's ♥♥♥♥ing cops everywhere so you'll never outrun them. Best thing is to just keep murdering them until you die.  There's also about 7 checkpoints in the whole game and it's kind of difficult so be prepared to repeat a lot of boring missions.  I will say one good thing. Mafia 2 has the best collectibles of any game ever. There's not even a close second.",

In Mafia 2 I'm spending most of the time driving around a boring city in a heavily story-driven game, with the occasional action sequence thrown in, followed by a litany of monotonous cut scenes. There's really not much else, except what the game allows you to do. You can explore the city before ending each chapter, but there's nothing to see. About the only saving grace this game has--aside from looking nice and having great period music--is that there are hundreds of wanted posters and authentic Playboy centerfolds to be found; and they are  ooh la la, magnifique!   I give this the over-hyped game of the year award for 2010. Until I can find a better gangster simulator I'm sticking with Mafia 1 and EA's The Godfather--both really good games that belong on Steam",

Cons: -Felt suckered into a FORCED campaign -Wished there was a pure free roam no feeling of being rushed/forced into campaign -End of story mode there is NO free roam... -Had Mafia II for ps3, got it free on pc -Never got a chance to drive a 5 ton duece....

And you will ♥♥♥♥ing drive us there!  Its not mafia its ♥♥♥♥ing worst taxi simulator i've played in years. Thanks for getting my hopes high, 2k.  The games is not so bad if you like driving, especially considering the physics here is not bad, but i wanted good plot and interesting missions, not this slow and boring drive fest.   I only can remember 4 missions or so that involed something more than driving, and that's not nearly enough to warrant 'very positive' 90%+ reviews on steam. Got no idea where they are coming from.",

            "review_text": "Mafia 2 is a story driven adventure game set in the 50's in an open world and has third person shooting mechanics with a rudimentary cover system.  Story The game has a really good story and cutscenes which track your story as you climb the mafia ladder.You play as Vito scalleta and it is set it just after world war 2.The cutscenes are the only thing that kept me involved in the game.  Gameplay  The gameplay is one of the most monotonous games I have ever played. All you do is drive around aimlessly to your next mission which involves a bunch of thugs and rinse and repeat. There are no missions that have you do something different. The city is large but there are no side missions at all and the main story is broken into 15 chapters. There is a brawling mechanic which is the most basic I have seen you have 1 button to defend and then you attack. The game mechanics are just so pedestrian.There are no bugs in the gameplay in driving and shooting but there is an utter lack of variety. there are places to change clothes,change vehicles if you are wanted and the police in this game are just placed so that they could sometimes chase you around. Absolutely sub par gameplay and level design.  Environment and Sound  The environment gives you a 50's feel but as there is nothing to do in it and is completely pointless. The sound design is okay and the radio stations are atrocious. I turned the radio volume off after the first stage.The graphics are okay nothing special.  This could have been a good movie instead of a game. They should have focussed more on the gameplay instead of putting work on the cutscenes and story.Not recommended unless you can bear the mediocre gameplay around the cutscenes. The game is short though and could be finished in about 8-10 hours.Utterly lifeless gameplay.",

            "review_text": "Mafia II is a game for those who love a good mob story. I would like to see more family drama but Vito's journey is a trip worth taking. Throughout the game, you follow Vito as he climb up the ranks of the mafia, from petty theft to mass murder. Behind the glamour of crime, money and prostitution is a broken man who's unsure of himself. You slowly start to sympathize with Vito, as he gets torn between his family and his job and the consequences of his actions becomes dire. His best friend, Joe, is also involved in organized crime but his likability comes from his carefree spirit and loyalty. The overarching narrative is divided into chapters, allowing the story to flow together nicely.  If you're looking for a good game, you're much better off playing GTA, or L.A. Noire if you're into the 40-50s era. Much of the main missions are pretty mundane and repetitive. You spend most of the game driving from Point A to Point B, to Point C and back to Point A again. Shooting sections are fun but ordinary. Mafia II has a nicely detailed period setting but some of the textures are rather lackluster and the open world is pretty empty. You can barely interact or do anything despite the size of Empire Bay. The gameplay is rather linear, which isn't a problem if the main missions had more variety and there are no side-quests to speak off. The playboy collectibles are a nice touch for any horny youngsters out there.  Mafia II may be a story-driven game but that shouldn't come at the expense of gameplay. There are loads of games that are both story and gameplay-driven, though I can't think of many that are set in the 40s, so if that's your preference, Mafia II isn't a complete waste of money. If you're hoping for a mafia version of GTA, you'll be disappointed.  6/10 - ABOVE AVERAGE",
