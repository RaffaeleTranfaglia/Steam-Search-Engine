Yes, it has some problems. Some of the sections are quite painful, and on higher difficulties the battles can be frustrating. However, it mixes everything up nicely and does a decent job of keeping things fresh. There is still some variety in this game, after all. Added to which, there are sections which are genuinely hilarious.  It isn't the best game, or FPS, you'll ever play, but it is worth a go. If you enjoyed the base game, I would also suggest getting the DLC - The Doctor Who Cloned Me. Worthy addition to an enjoyable experience.  P.S. Captain Dylan is a classic.",

I had heard the game was terrible and, as I didn't want to ruin the nostalgia that I felt for Duke Nukem, I decided that I was going to avoid this title. I was so, so wrong to judge this game before experiencing it first hand.  The game may not be perfect, but it is definitely fun. I found it to be as enjoyable as any first person shooter that has been released in the last few years. Duke is back in all of his glory and the gunplay is a blast. His crude one-liners are more than welcome after the decade plus that I've waited for a worthy return and I found myself laughing frequently.  The mechanics of the game run flawlessly. I didn't experience a single issue the entire time I played and the aiming and character controls are top notch. Every single death and missed shot in the game felt like it was 100% my fault and not some aspect that was overlooked by the developer. Another aspect of the game that I enjoyed was that, although the number of weapons to be found is about on par with the other games, all of the remained viable throughout the game. They all have their pros and cons that you can use to your advantage for each situation that you find yourself in. It also should be mentioned that, unlike the vast majority of FPS games out there, the game never felt monotonous to me. One moment you'll be running and gunning, the next you'll be platforming after being shrunk down to the size of a can of soup, and the next you'll be manning a turret as hordes of alien ships and reinforments are en route to kill you.  There are two parts of Duke Nukem Forever that keep it from being an absolute gem, however. First, is the restriction on the number of guns that you can carry. Duke Nukem used to be a walking arsenal. Every weapon that you found in the game you kept for the rest of your campaign and could use it at any time as long as you had the ammunition for it. The second improvement to the game that could have made it a classic would be the vehicle controls. Driving Duke's monster truck, while fun to run over aliens with, was a bit more of a hassle than I would have liked. It wasn't absolutely terrible but it was enough that I was less than excited when I saw it ahead of me and knew that I would be driving instead of running and gunning which I would have preferred. Fortunately, you don't spend very much time in it.  I recommend this game to any first person shooter fans and especially to old Duke Nukem fans. I had a blast and played it from start to finish in about ten hours over the course of four days. This -is- the worthy successor to Duke Nukem that I had hoped it to be and I had to get the word out about my experience!",

The Game play is... ok, the graphics were fine which led me wondering why people gave it a bad review, when i played it i felt as if this was not even considered a Duke Nukem game.... I Fell if this game were to have someone else in it instead of Duke this would be a fantastic game, however 3d Realms kept delaying and now we got this. As a fan this game is not worth it, you will be really disappointed, For several reasons like the ability to kick your enimies is gone, duke barley talks to ayone interacting with him, he canonly carry two weapons, and those are like Duke's greatest assets, you take that away from him and you just have some blond a-hole Duke wannabe running around i am sorry to say. It was a good thing i tried this game for myself, the same thing happened with Postal 3 people hated so much but when i played it, i felt at home, with Duke Nukem forever i felt like i wasn't even playing as Duke. For someone who has never heard of Duke Nukem before this game would be ok for you to buy, but any Duke Nukem fans... i fell it's not worth it but thats only my opion over all it is a pretty sharp game.",

It's slightly amusing that some of the main flaws of this game such as regenerating health are actually taken from the modern style FPS's that the same reviewers love. It seems incredibly hypocritical to me.  This is not me saying that the game is perfect, far from it, it does have its flaws and it doesn't re-invent the wheel, it most certainly won't have the same impact Duke3D had on the genre all those years ago but that doesn't make it a bad game. It is a solid and above average FPS, with some great humour (immature but what do you expect?). It doesn't justify nearly 15 years of development, yes it does miss out on some opportunities of being even better and ok, it wont win Game of tthe Year, but taken at face value, DNF is a very enjoyable game that I will be playing through again.",

For starters, and even newcomers who never have seen duke before, there will be some real problems here. We all know what it means. Duke back on 96 was the blast. And now we are seeing something awful, but, to newcomers, that are used to BF 3 or COD, with all those grapics and so, well, don't expect something so 'good shape lookin'. This game does not features the best graphics ever, and does not have the same freedom you had in 96. Yup, that's true. But keep in mind you are playing duke nukem. People play this game for it's gameplay, and for the fun. It's nice to ride cars, something impossible in 96, or even have some new weapons. Of course the game is not perfect, but we have Duke, and he makes the game better. All the dlc's and the game core are pretty nice, and you are always going to have some good moments with friends in MP. Yes, there are not many players there, but, we the little number of players there are good persons, mostly nice persons with true gamer spirit, not like the community from L4D or TF2, with mic spam or trolls every now and then. Remember that if you are here because you are a Duke fan, you will be in the perfect place. And if you are not, and think the game is bad... Well, give it a try, and instead of looking for the 'bad' things on the game, take a good ride with a monster truck, dismember someone with the shotgun, melee kill someone and kick all the alien asses on the way. That's the spirit. So, depite all the things the haters say, give it a look for yourself, and if you think nooe is there to play mp, well... Call me and I'll be there. Hail to the king baby! ",

But isn't that what Duke Nukem's built on??   Yes I thought it was kind of predictable and frustrating at times with some puzzles. And yeah some of it was gross. And of course it would have been better if they settled all their legal stuff years ago to release it at a time where it'd be more relevant than it is now. But it was funny and entertaining! Driving the RC car in the casino was fun! Seeing three boobed fixtures on the walls of an alien cave and the ability to slap them was super funny and outrageous to me. sI slapped them over and over again because I kept Hearing dumb lines like 'tight fit' which had me laughing my ♥♥♥ off. Killing the aliens with whatever I could use--a car, a rocket launcher etc--was extremely gratifying--and I wanted to finish the game. I had fun with it because I didn't approach it like it was going to be a life changing experience, like some of these other reviewers (no offense).  Just give it a shot if it's free or a couple bucks. Cuz again IT IS STUPID in so many ways. But there are a lot of games that are stupid that end up being pretty fun! Just don't approach it seriously like it's an award winning game like the Witcher. Cuz, you guys, Iit's Duke Nukem. It's supposed to be dumb.

But I assure you most of these people are C.O.D fanboys that expected a serious, realistic game. No, this is a unique experience in it's own gener of gaming, fun. You may not have the same level of humor as me but the jokes and one liners Duke makes give me a smile and a laugh.  SINGLE PLAYER- Overall this game takes after the years of Duke but the aliens have come back for revenge. I'll admit, some of the gameplay controls do feel sloppy at first when you start but I mostly have no problem what so ever taking out the bad guys. People conplain about the gameplay mecanics like driving and shooting but this is the case of either the player or the game itself that is doing something wrong, for me it's the player, nothing wrong with the game. Throughout levels you'll come across the small, interactable things witch make it more entertaining just to play and if you're searching for acheivements then you'll get them pretty esay as you play. You may die a few time to faults made by mistakes that can frustrate people, depending on your PC build the loading time will get annoying.  MULTIPLAYER- The multiplayer takes the exact same elements from single player to this. Same gunplay and controls but is still fun to customise your own Duke in a few variety of ways. What makes multiplayer worth playing is the unlockables to use in 'Your Digs'. This is Duke apartment, when you first enter everything will be in storage crates and you need to be a certian level in the game to unlock. From different interactable props to unlockable babes makes the place more lively and more enjoyable. Lag can be a problem for me and many other players but is capable to get used to. As long as you shoot someone when your crosshair is red then you'll always hit them.  CONCLUSION- Nukem has aged ever since his retro years but is still very enjoyable. I personally give this a rating of 7/10. I first got this on Xbox 360 when it first came out and wasn't disappointed and got it again on Steam when it went on sale, so if you're sceptical about this game, best to wait for a sale to come across.  RECOMMENDED TO- People who want to enjoy a laid back game and want to have a good laugh. Those who'd like to relive Duke. UNRECOMMENDED TO- Hardcore type gamers who are compedtitive, proberbly to those who get frustrated easily to.  Yes... You can pick up crap and throw it around... ",

And it's on the action that I'd recomend the game, because that's when it feels most like DN3D.

I know that is a LOT to get past, but I played 'Send in the Clones' and enjoyed a few good chuckles, and it was just kind of fun to step back into the shoes of the narcissistic Duke. The main game is a little tedious in places, but it is still fun, the achievements are actually fun to go after and it has a sense of humor about itself. Don't get me wrong, I think the cutscenes in the alien hive were some of the worst the game has to offer (trust me, hit youtube and look it up if you haven't played this... you'll understand why).   This also isn't a game I'd let my kid play (if I had one), as it has some SUPER adult themes (and if you don't know what a glory hole is, maybe you shouldn't be playing it either), and I wouldn't want any kid thinking that Duke is a role model in any way, shape or form (especially for his treatment of women). 3D was more fun back in the 90s, but there is a little humor, charm and a halfway decent FPS under all of this crap.",

From the aspect of 'modern gamers' it's not even worth the 'mediocre game' title since the gameplay and the story gets a tiny bit of repetitive and boring after the half of the game. Seriously though I really expected some extra twists after I reached that crucial part of the storyline yet nothing happened. It has some nice ideas and many one-liners (some of them are painfully dumb, it's like I'm listening to some 8 year old through a Skype chat. XD). I can't blame the devs for it since it's clear that this game does not belong to this 'gaming era'. It's a relic from a long passed age where FPS games meant nothing, but mindless shooting with some little extra platforming sequences, but there is one really odd thing about this statement. The character of Serious Sam is an almost completely direct rip-off of Duke Nukem yet Sam works perfectly in parts where Duke fails gloriously. One: One-liners': Duke is nowhere as near entertaining as Sam is. His one-liners are following one simple rule 'Say ♥♥♥♥, no matter what.' Most of the time he isn't even trying to be funny, just '♥♥♥♥ing around' like a kid who has just learned a few bad words and is eager to try them out on something. Two: Enemies: I'm not completely sure about this one, but as I played the game, nothing seemed to explain the origins of these aliens, we don't know any of their plans it seems like that the main reason of their revenge is just to ♥♥♥♥ Duke off. 'Sam' howewer has a Seriously detailed background 'database' for all of the available enemies, the storyline, even for the weapons and for the levels themselves! These short arguments may not be valid for a long time DN fan, but the only thing I'm trying to point here is that the 'imitation' of Duke surpassed it's own 'master' which is pretty hilarious considering all those references in Sam games and the development time of DNF. As my final words regarding this game: A gem/ghost from the past which will only be enjoyed by old gamers. (Probably my longest commendation ever. XD)",

            "review_text": "I wanted to like Duke Nukem Forever. I really did.  When early reviews criticized the game for poor graphics, crude/outdated humour, dumb AI, and linear levels, I gave the game the benefit of the doubt and hoped that the bad reviews stemmed from unrealistic expectations - expectations that were inflated to reflect the 10+ years that the game was supposedly in development for.   Having spent many, many hours with DNF, I regret to say that the game is indeed a disappointment. It isn't all bad. Aside from inexplicably playing too much like a Halo/COD clone for my liking, I find the game's biggest issue to be the technical problems that have put me in a position to constantly replay the beginning of vehicle-based levels because something about those levels significantly ramps up the extent to which the game locks up/freezes on my computer.  Here is an analysis of the major factors that comprise this game:  PLOT: There is a plot, but it's pretty weak and uninspired. If anything, it gets in the way of the action that this game revolves around since there are instances where you're foreced to wait for NPCs who are blocking your path to stop talking until you can proceed to your next objective. Listening to these NPCs should be optional!  GRAPHICS: For the most part, they look fine for what they are. Duke Forever never aspired to be the graphical successor to Crysis, so it's silly to compare it to such graphically astounding titles. Although the enemies look cool and much more menacing than they did in Duke Nukem 3D, some of the backgrounds seem very bland (i.e. Duke's Hotel) or feature details that stand out as very, very pixelated (i.e. Sunshine reflecting off of the wall of a large barn in the 'Ghost Town' map). The game looks a little too dark and gritty for my liking.  SOUND: The reworked theme song notwithstanding, the game's music is nothing to write home about. The sound effects, on the other hand, are very well done. Jon St. John's voice acting for Duke is superb; it lends the game personality and makes me laugh because it is just as buffoonishly over the top and anachronistic as it was when Duke first started speaking in 1996.  Critics who whine about how dated Duke Nukem comes across in DNF need to get their heads checked. Telling anonymous women to 'Shake it, baby!' wasn't politically correct in the mid- to late-90s, but most of those who condemn Duke for continuning to objectify women in a similar fashion in 2011 incorrectly imply that his behaviour was excusable in D3D because it was in-line with the times. It wasn't. Duke was - and remains - a parodic embodiment of sex, drugs, violence, and machismo taken to absurd extremes.  My favourite element of Duke Nukem Forever is the re-worked Holoduke accessory. Whereas it was conceptually cool but not very practical in Duke Nukem 3D, using it in DNF cloaks you in a Predator-style skin and produces a holographic replica of Duke that messes up his catchphrases. These botched lines ALWAYS crack me up! An added bonus is that the holographic image of Duke is now genuinely distracting to human foes: it moves around and appears to shoot like an actual multiplayer opponent would.  GAME DESIGN: Sadly, DNF's maps are super linear. Whereas levels in D3D could be navigated a multitude of ways and were chock-full of secrets that encouraged and rewarded exploration and taking chances, navigation in Duke Nukem Forever can usually be summed up like this: move into a corridor; defeat all of its enemies; move into the next corridor. Rinse and repeat.  One of Duke 3D's very best levels - Hollywood Holocaust - was recycled into DNF as a multiplayer-only map. The redone map gives away all of original's secret areas; you literally need do little more than walk or fly around to discover virtually every inch of this map. Now there are no switches to trigger, no walls to blow up, and practically no skill is involved to see everything there is to see. This remade level is a microcosmic representation of what what you get when you compare the spirit of D3D's level design to that of DNF's.  The game's shooting mechanics are solid, but the weapon, ammunition, and health systems they are closely linked to really detract from my enjoyment of the game. Because the game arbitrarily imposes a low weapon limit, most enemies will become sources of ammo or new weapons once they're slain. Players feel no incentive to fight carefully, conserve ammo, or seek it out in hidden places, because they're practically guaranteed to have an ample arsenal whenever the dust of a skirmish settles. The health system is even worse; Duke's health regenerates over time. You can be completely careless about the way you fight and have the confidence of knowing that you'll come out with 100% health so long as you're patient enough to wait a few seconds before advancing to take on the next batch of enemies.  To the credit of DNF's developers, they found a creative way of excusing the shift from a traditional health system to one aping that of Halo/COD: It's not Duke's health that gets hurt in battle, but rather, his ego. So long as Duke's over-confident, over-inflated sense of self worth remains above a set threshold, he keeps on going. He doesn't need to pick up health packs; he just needs a few seconds to clear whatever abuse he just withstood from his mind to feel as good as new. I don't like this new system, but I like the logic that went into implementing it into Duke Nukem Forever.  CONTROL: For the most part, the game controls fine. I really only have two gripes about it. First, in-game VoIP Chat is spotty. Whereas I can count on Left 4 Dead to always broadcast my voice when I'm wearing a headset and I have the game configured to read any input from it, I have had mixed results getting others to hear me in DNF. On a more serious note, I recently gave up on playing the game because of a long-standing conflict between some of 2K's titles and Steam: a bug triggered by the Steam Overlay prohibits you from moving around. I have spent considerable time trying to un-do this bug, and have given up - mainly because I have already spent tons and tons of time struggling with a problem that has plagued me since I first started playing the game: Intermittent freezing.  TECHNICAL QUALITY: DNF freezes on me. A LOT. Every time it freezes, the game's window locks up, the sound stutters, and I have to manually launch the task bar and force DNF to abort its operations for my system to be useful again. The freezing symptoms seem to happen at random, but occur a HELL of a lot more frequently when I have to get around by monster truck rather than on foot. Because players are forced to spend the first half of 'Ghost Town' zooming around in a truck, I spent way more time loading, aborting, and restarting that section of the game than I would like to admit. It would almost always freeze within 3 seconds of playing the stage, and fiddling with the game's graphical and sound options didn't make a damned bit of difference in terms of reducing the problem.   My computer's hardware is more than capable of handling DNF on max settings, yet no game I've attempted to play has handled anywhere as poorly as DNF. My drivers are all up to date. I've tried compatibility modes. I even reluctantly made the switch from Windows 7 to Windows 8, yet not even that resolved the freezing issue.  CONCLUSION: Duke Nukem Forever is not a great game in its own right, but I still enjoyed it enough to want to reach its climax. However, the crippling bugs I outlined not only soured my impression of the game, but convinced me to never, ever spend money on another PC port by publisher 2K Games (The freezing bug also affects Bioshock).  QUICK RECAP: Mostly good graphics. Superb sound. Mediocre music. Lame level design. Servicable plot. Decent AI. Tarnished by regenerating health and low weapon limits. Crippling bugs. Skip it unless you are a die-hard Duke Nukem fan.",

            "review_text": "So the Duke Nukem 3d 20th Anniversary World Tour is going to be released soon, so in order to celebrate I decided to play Duke Nukem Forever again, to see if I hated it as much now as I did when I preordered it. So, do I still think it's the worst game ever? Well...no. I've certainly played games that were much worse. But I still think it's pretty bad.  Duke Nukem Forever is guilty of using just about every gimmick and cliche used in FPS games made in the 2000-2009 era, and I wish I was joking. Magically regenerating health, limited stamina, only being able to carry two weapons, forcing you to solve puzzles to progress, events where you either have to take control of a turret or drive a vehicle...you name it. But out of all these tired and overdone cliches, what really seals the coffin on this game for me is that this game is made up entirely of quicktime and scripted events, and the levels are so linear there's no room for any exploring whatsoever.   In other words, instead of the fast-paced and intense gameplay in a large map that required us to explore high and low for secrets, health, ammo and keys to progress, while at the same time trying not to die to entire armies of aliens? That's all been replaced with linear paths, scripted events and NPCs that refuse to let you progress until you've either killed a few aliens the game wanted you to kill, or force you to listen to meaningless dialogue that adds little or nothing to the game, but thought you should listen to it anyway.   So did Duke Nukem Forever do anything correctly? Kind of. Duke is still that womanizing horndog that we got to know and love in 1996 that spews one liners and cracks jokes. However, unlike Duke 3d where it was done with some moderation, this game feels like it was filled to the brim with almost nothing but toilet humor and nudity galore. Not necessarily a bad thing, but my goodness does it tend to get old quickly.  I didn't exactly expect Duke Nukem Forever to be a masterpiece after waiting for more than a decade for it to come out, but I did expect it to be something refreshing and new. Unfortunately it was neither of these things, and while I don't think it's the worst game ever, I've played far too many games that were just like it. 1.5/5.0",

            "review_text": "A stunning and unnecessary letdown.   Like many gamers of my age-range I have a very personal connection with this game since I have been waiting for it for more than a decade and on top of that I have avoided playing DNF since its surprising actual release in 2011 until now when I got it via humblebundle. Suffice to say the release of Duke Nukem Forever feels like a historical event. When it was first announced back in 1997 I was in elementary school. A lot has changed in my life, in the world, in gaming since then. It's been so long you could basically make a wonderful period piece about the late-nineties because that era of gaming is obscured to many active gamers just by virtue of their late birth, just as the dawn of gaming is shrouded in mystery for me. It's almost impossible to describe in words what images flash before my eyes when I think of that time. Polygons came and swept everyone away, 3D accelerators arrived and did the same to everyone's wallet. Memories of marveling at the prowess of 3Dfx cards and saving my pocket money to buy the 64mb of RAM required to play Star Trek Elite Force. Hours of sweaty desperation spent trying to translate the levels I had drawn in school into the Build Engine in a time before I was able to properly (or rather barely) speak english - I think it's necessary to underline these precious memories a bit so you can properly understand my frustration and disappointment with this title, because it's so very easy to grab me by the nostalgia gonads and yank my wallet around by it, yet DNF failed to do so.  Through subsequent years and countless 3D engines DNF frequently occasionally reared its ugly stubborn head, changing faces numerous times. Around 2003/4 it seemed even somewhat finished with an intriguing trailer that put it right up there with other FPS of the new millenium like Timesplitters, Red Faction, XIII and the likes. The years gone-by saw the rise of fluent console first person shooters, endless retreads of 'tactical' shooters like the Call of Duty series and the development of most gaming genres coming to a grinding halt. DNF could have been a sparkling beacon of the virtues of times past.  We have to move back in time a few years to understand why DNF was such a letdown. It might seem obvious that about 14 years of anticipation could never be matched but I think that anticipation has been overrated when it comes to the critical reception of this game. In the 90s the first-person shooter ruled supreme. In hindsight it's hard to imagine but back then it was one of the (maybe even  the ) most creative and innovative genres on the PC (consoles would follow several years later because people hadn't figured out yet that you could use a dual analog-stick layout like a mouse and keyboard setup). Doom had pushed the door wide open and the genre originally titled 'Doom-clones' went crazy with the formula the next couple of years. Level designs got more intricate/confusing and still manage to impress to this day, weapons and enemies got more outlandish and so forth. Among those many shooters from the late nineties Duke Nukem 3D and its contemporaries on the lovely Build engine like Blood, Shadow Warrior or Redneck Rampage stuck out. Technically inferior to the all-polygon competition of Quake 1 and 2 they managed to trump with intricate level design, off-beat humour, general levels of weirdness and an overall personality that has yet to meet its match. A more innocent time, buckets of gore, really dumb humour, it was  glorious . FPSs would ultimately lose their edge in the following years ironically by evolving. Half-Life and Unreal were shining examples of the genre taken to the next level but many of the competitors failed to grasp what made these titles so unique and just copied the formula more and more. Which is what got us to the stale First Person Shooter world of today. Of course there are always exceptions, this is just a very personal and biased recollection of the last 20 years of PC gaming by your humble narrator.  Being a former hardcore gamer by 2011 I was basically turned off by most mainstream titles. The crazy production values imposed on AAA gaming still prove to be a detriment to the overall quality of games and especially the willingness by creators to take risk and innovate. It was basically the time that gaming connoiseurs used to get into retro- and indie-gaming, two gifts that keep on giving. Finally enter Duke Nukem Forever. Throughout a troubled (oh what an understatement) development cycle (aka hell) there was still hope that it would triumph and personally I wished it to be amazing and even after so many years of waiting and tiredless mocking by the press (DNF = did not finish etc.) there was some hope. DNF has the attitude and braindead humour you've come to expect and love and being a relic from a different time could have worked to its benefit (just take a look at retro-styled indie games) - it didn't need to be the most innovative game of all time to succeed. I think a lot of people were merely clamoring for a fast, relentless, charmingly dumb, politically incorrect old-school FPS with loads of funny weapons, punishing difficulty, complex multi-layered levels etc. It could have worked had it stuck to its original strengths. The big problem here despite the commendable attitude and outdated but welcome style of humour Duke Nukem Forever turned out ot be a by-the-numbers contemporary FPS, painfully bland and unengaging.  Everything boring about the standard FPS is found here. Painfully linear over-choreographed levels, an artifical two-weapon limit (why oh why? Halo wasn't  that  good), regenerating health, abundance of Checkpoints that take any challenge and punishment out of failing, unnecessary and shockingly uninspired turret sections, the list goes on. Beyond that, the basic shooting mechanics are just not fun, all the weapons lack punch and style. If DNF had been a retro throwback, warts and all, I would have commended it but what we got in the end was a bland experience, symptomatic of everything boring with current First person shooters. It makes fun of all the tropes but still uses them.  In the end DNF is possibly the greatest example of blue balls in the gaming world. It's a fascinating little trainwreck that should have never been released. As is, it's quite interesting to disect. You can cut through it like a tree and see all the rings, all the engine changes, remnants of changing trends in gaming, different developers who just gave up, but that doesn't make the gameplay any less tiring and mediocre. It clearly feels like an unfinished game that was left in the vault for too long, only to be slightly dusted off and subsequently released.  There's a scene in the first Star Trek movie where a beaming accident causes a Spock-stand-in to be horribly mangled in the process and die quickly in a grotesque blob of flesh and guts. I don't remember the exact line that was spoken there but it was something like 'What went through didn't live long, fortunately'. Almost twenty years after I first anticipated Duke Nukem Forever I can finally put its corpse to rest. Not worth anyone's time. Avoid it, it's really as bad as everyone says.",

I've counted every day, hour and minute for its release. When it was finally released, nothing else in the world did matter.  I finished the game in just ONE sitting, in the hardest setting. Got 60% of the achievements in one swoop. I wasn't even rushing, I was taking my time to enjoy the game. I was dazed and confused. What went wrong?   Well, I got it down what went wrong AS A DUKE NUKEM GAME:  - The game offers no challenge whatsoever. Everything feels easy. - I could only use two guns per time. TWO guns. Screw you, you're only holding 2 guns at a time. - The game is linear. No keycards, no switches, nothing. Just straight forward. - No puzzles. I only got like one or two of these and they weren't memorable. You won't be spending your time with them. - The level design is just awful. As I said, the game is a corridor, so don't expect those rooms and layers you're used to on a normal Duke Nukem game. - The soundtrack didn't seem fitting. I miss that bassy MIDI songs. - Health recovery like CoD or Halo games killed 50% of the fun. You won't be begging for medikits, you just get behind a cover and wait. - Gun impact felt bland. Gunplay was very dull. - Shooting sections feel cheap. They lock the room and throw enemies at you. That's pretty much it.  And what went right:  + I like the new guns. + Multiplayer was a fun mode but it was condemned since day one. + It's Duke Nukem. He's that guy full of one liners and wrong jokes.

After playing Castlevania IV I was hugely impressed by the ability to whip in 8 different directions in comparison to the normal 4 and I thought this was a huge leap in innovation for the gaming industry. As a result, when I first decided to play Duke Nukem Forever (a game which was released 20 years after Castlevania IV) I expected to see the same innovative ideas. To my shock (and horror) I discovered that Duke Nukem Forever does not feature 8 directional-whips, in fact, Duke Nukem Forever doesn't have whips at all! This was most disappointing because I was really looking forward to whipping in 16 different directions but maybe 20 years isn't enough to create digital whips that whip in that many directions.   Whereas Castlevania IV has the player advance through various themed (and spooky) stages until you arrive at Dracula's Lair and defeat him in a climactic end to the only good Castlevania game, Duke Nukem Forever has you save American pornstars from Kotaku writers. Personally I think that saving the world from Dracula is more important than saving American pornstars but I am not a cis-gendered feminist so what do I know.  In conclusion I would recommend Super Duke Nukem IV over Castlevania Forever because there are a lot of innuendos and sexual jokes about ♥♥♥♥♥♥s and those are my favourite types of jokes.",

It's like a cross section of all of the shooters of the previous 10 years (from 2000-2010) with nothing done particularly well (or poorly), but with none of the run-and-gun-blow-em-up action that defined the Duke genre.

It's not a horrible game at all, I've played worst before. It's just too bad the game is far from all I was expecting considering the hype on it. Every now and then I play the old Duke3d and the first 2 games in series, that were good games and I never get tired of those ones. But this, probably I'll finish it and let it get virtual dust on my steam library. If it weren't a Duke Nukum game, I could slightly recommend it and give a 6/10. But gearbox completely ruined it and knowing it was a great title, they could've done much better. Looks like they weren't giving a s**t about the game quality and just made a generic shooter expecting ppl would like it just because its name. That's why I won't recommend it. In fact, if you are willing to buy it, wait for a special and grab it if it's no more than 5 bucks.  Edit.: I Just finished this game, and it was a pain from the beginning to the end.

When I first played the game I was heavily blinded by nostalgia, thus ignoring many of the games issues until I played through it the second time, to which only then did I realise what a colossal piece of sh*t this game was.  Negatives: .Low quality textures for a modern game which is not surprising considering it uses the Unreal 2.5 engine but even than I've played games (such as MK vs DC universe) that have utilised the potential of the engine to higher standards -For those who are console users I've heard that the console versions of the game suffered from texture pop-ins (essentially the textures are not rendered fast enough on whatever you appear to look at the time. .Gameplay, rather than have the fast paced gameplay from its predocessor, DN Forever moves at a more sluggish pace similar to that of most modern FPS such as Halo or Call of Duty, even worse considering that when Duke sprints he tires out within 8 seconds. .Regenerative health, aka. the Ego bar. .Two weapon limit (Four on the patched version for pc) .Linear level designs, which eliminates level exploration. .Boss battles are ridiculously easy as you are essentially given limitless supply of ammunition for the either the rocket launcher or the devastators. .Terrible driving mechanics (not surprising since Gearbox were the ones to develop the driving mechanics) .Terrible ending. .Wall b**bs, WTF!  Positives: Most of Duke's one liners are still awesome From what I've seen from the expansion pack 'The Doctor who cloned me' it actually looks fun. The fellow who is friends with Duke is rather funny even if some of his lines are vulgar. The 'Content' that a lot fans have wanted to see again in the series.  Overall the game was just a let down and I hope that when 3D realms (The creators of the Duke Nukem series) make the prequel to Duke Nukem 1 known as 'Duke Begins' that they learn from their mistakes so as to avoid making another DN Forever because every fan of the series does not want a bad Duke Nukem game, no fan does.

So, here I am after  surprisingly  playing this piece of garbage for over 3 hours.  By the time you're reading this review, I am pretty sure you are aware of how bad this game is. It's bland, it has toilet humor kids in 5th grade would find too low to their tastes and it's pretty god damn boring. I am assuming you were thinking to yourself 'Well then maybe I should buy this as a joke game?'. To that I say: Maybe.  This game came out after what I liked to think was a new era in the video game industry: Mass Effect, Crysis, Bioshock, Assassin's Creed, The Orange Box and others were bringing new ideas to the table - new mechanics were introduced, gameplay aspects renewed for a new generation of both console and PC gamers, new narratives, stories and much more dedication was present in each and every game. I was expecting every game released from 2007 and onwards to be groundbreaking, or I was at least expecting them to follow the same lines.  Unfortunately, I was young and naive.  This game is slow, it features a small variety of weapons and allows you to carry only two of them (EDIT: You can actually mark the option to allow you to carry 2 additional guns... Why?! what's the point?!), it is anticlimactic, sexist and distateful (see: 'wall ♥♥♥♥' and 'pregnant women explosions'), has the level design of a Call of duty game, without the mildly fun parts, and to top it all off, it's unfunny.  If Duke Nukem Forever was a rollercoaster, it would probably have a very slow setting, homeless people posing as monster and strippers waving as you pass by them, and much like a rollercoaster tycoon ride, it will end with either you dying or asking for a refund.  My final score for this game is 'You should be paid to play this game' (Which I wasn't, unfortunately).",

WHY???? i want to shoot aliens! not solve half-life2 puzzles!  -horrible story and characters. - i know story is not supposed to matter in a duke nukem game. but its bad dialouges, stupid characters are forced upon you. the entire game you feel you are sorrounded by idiots.  -stupid, pointless and forced sexual scenes. - sexual content SHOULD NEVER be a selling point in any game! yet this game tries as hard as it can to ram as many digitized breasts up your face as much as possible. with the biggest offender being the strip-club level. in which you are forced to explore a strip club to find sex toys. and that's it. pathetic.  -ammo limit - why am i only allowed to have only 5 missles in my RPG? why am i only allowed to have 25 shotguns shells???  the game is not 100% bad though. when you actually DO get to shoot aliens. it's pretty fun. and the weapon veraiety is great. it's a bit annoying to die to enemies that were not properly explained how they function. but once you learn by yourself its alright.  it's too bad that in order to get to those shooting parts you have to swim through waves of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  in the end, this game is a disgrace to the original Duke3d - 4/10",

There is potential for good in Duke Nukem Forever; the first two levels or so are likeable enough in a juvenile way, and there are some genuinely great set pieces -- the ghost town, the mine cart bits, the underwater section -- and I found the shrinking mechanism to be enjoyable, in the Duke Burger level anyway.

And yes if you look away from the fact that this game isn't the Duke Nukem most hoped for and pla pla. Well it is still not really good, the graphics are decent but not that good the texture quality is just poor for 2011 also why is there only FXAA? Why no MXAA or something like that?  But there are other problems too, the difficulty is not that big of a deal mostly you can play it on arder dificulties just fine because the for the most times your cause of death isn't the difficulty and your skills they are just damn cheap!. Seriously sometimes the boss toss something in the direction where you are supposed to hide so you can't anymore and than when you are just low at health they toss rockets at you, because they don't have such great pattern. Also allot of deaths where you just shot the guys and than: 'Holy Shot where did that came from?' and you are dead, I really love it when there is a turret section and at the end a ship flys over you and you are supposed to know that the turret section is now over and it will shoot missle at you in such a rate that you can't run at all. Also some Enemies you think you know what is going on and than there come dozens of enemies. I mean at least you know after that that they are comming but at every new section that happens. Also I am not very found of the idea of self closing door. Because I like to go trough a door and just backwards out of it again to get some cover. And nope I am not just baaad at games, Normaly I see that it was my fault when I die in games and hey I've made it trough Fallout NV in the hardcore mood just fine even that game had crapy controlles, but it wasn't that cheap. Even the new Rise of the Triad I made it trough in harder Dificulties, damn I've even done Duke Nukem 3D on the Hardest Difficulty. And yes they are damn hard but they are not cheap like this game. Also sometimes the weapons seem to do damn ♥♥♥♥, the shotgun seems to be the best option because it kills the aliens the fastes, but just in short range. Also normaly you can shoot a pig with one shot but sometimes you need 3, Why? No Idea!. And also I really hate how the redone the Freezergun, seriously in 3D it froozes Enemies in about no time. But here it takes some seconds so you could also use a shotgun. And not to mention that on raving pigs it doesn't work, at all. You can't freeze them. At least the shrunk gun is still pretty fun. Also did I mention that Pigs can rave now, I don't think that is pretty nice in this specific game, where in Borderlands the Goilats where made fine you could tell when they where about to explode and rage at you and here it sometimes seem to happen at random and also they ♥♥♥♥ing kill you fast. They don't seem to fit very well expecially if you just had fun with some guns and than there is a ♥♥♥♥ing raging pig that kills you. Also Explosions, stay away from Explosions but the aliens don't bother they have to stand right next to the barrel to die from it, also the pipebombs are not that harmfull for a crowed of enemies. Yeah right, like back to 3D it was allot of fun, hell also in allot of other games but here they are way more dull.  There are some really nice things like the Ego System that does allot of fun also that you gain strenght for a while after drinking a beer but Duke doesn't seem to handle beer very well, one can of american beer and everything gets blury also he burps allot like he has some digesting problems!.  All in all just buy it if you are a die hard fan or if you want some ammusement, but all in all it is pretty bad as a full prize so try to get it cheap.",

I will start off saying that I really did enjoy the never shorted cheese factor (something I loved about the Duke 3D game). I also enjoyed most of the wide interactivity of many things in the game world.  Now for THE REST OF THE GAME; horrible, just horrible. The constant attempts at creating advanced puzzles based on all the hard work in making most of the world interactive lead to needlessly complicated puzzles that either took far too long to figure out, or were infinitely frustrating in dealing with doing EXACTLY what they want, step by step, or sudden demise. This would not even be much of an issue if the game supported quick saves... but alas, this is another game that employs the ever so frustrating 'check point' way of saving. There were way too many times that there were large stretches of the game between check points, then other times where the check points were close together... and of course the further stretched check points always came way after an absurdly over drawn and stupidly difficult puzzle full of far too many frustratingly easy ways to die.  Again, I really REALLY tried to like this game, I really did!

PROS: Well, the voice actor sounds the part. There are some neat mechanics that could have possibly been something (ego increases, etc.)  CONS: Hitboxes are wonky, as is physics in general. Enemies can shoot through solid (unbreakable) cover. For example, I got shot through a building or wall multiple times. The controls are unweildy at times. When on the dukeburger level, I touched the conrner of a box and bounced at a diagnoal midway across the room to my death. Speaking of death, some of the checkpoints (particulary where the controls are aweful,) aren't any good. Why not just let us save? Several areas are just boring and repetitive. Stand here and shoot for several minutes. Definitely moves away from the original in some of the worst ways. The difficulty settings feel weird and untrue sometimes (caveat: limited experience with that).  EDIT: Forgot about getting stuck on terrain and invisible walls! Several times, I've jumped places only to find invisible walls causing me to miss or fall to my death.

Cool 90s simulator From the ♥♥♥ slapping humor, the referances, to the usage of Beer and Steroids as items. Especially the action figure levels  2. First person shooting with cool guns After playing Shadow Warrior, Doom 1 &amp; 2, Heretic &amp; Hexen and some Duke 3D: I think I understand what 'cool guns' is. Or how its suppose to play.  3. Filler content Puzzle platforming, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ short 'interactive' cinematics, physic puzzles, lots of 'oh we can do this in engine like its 2001-2004!'  These 3 things mesh somewhat. But its also problematic.  I.E The irst 2 things don't really mesh, the way this game is made. You are controlling a very slow elite solider, who can barely move. The gun's generally don't do anything either. Most of them are terrible in their own ways. And as the level design evolve, you spot another issue: Duke is practically blind. The extreme narrow vision don't work out at all. While its true a lot of 90s fps features very narrow vision, it worked out differently when you could snap across extremely large rooms, in rapid speed. It works out terrible when Duke is slow, can barely damage anything, can't see anything, and keeps getting flanked. But that also brings us to the next point on the agenda: Enemies don't really deal damage. They don't feel scary. Fighting them feels like swatting flies, slow flies that poke you.  But generally your guns are not any better. The best weapon might even be the pistol, simply because its accurate and has raw damage. Every other weapon has crippling flaws, and generally feels awful. 'Different weapons do better against different enemies', thats what the hint tells you. Not really. The pistol is the best. Even if something like the shotgun is cool, its pointless when it only works as a melee weapon. And all weapons feel worse than the pistol and shotgun.  But then: Point 3 of the list comes if, you complete a combat section. Either you have to wait for new cinematic and a enemy bash trough something, or you encounter the dreaded physic puzzles.  You can't just become good, and go really really fast. Instead you have to spend a lot of time waiting around, for the horrible cinematics. Some of them are amusing, but most aren't that good. Its just waiting around A LOT for a NPC to stop blocking door ways.   And at some point, you enter a boss fight. Okay, so you need to use explosive weapons. But explosive weapons have practically no ammo. Often there will be a ammo container on the scene. Or a rocket launcher tucked somewhere on scene, so you can obtain a explosive weapon. It doesn't feel great at all. Some of the finishers looks good, as in humoristically good. Thats a plus. But most bosses are terrible to fight. The best boss might even be the final one, because it lacks the obstacles earlier bosses have.  Because instead of camping a ammo chest, rocket pigs are his reinforcement. Because instead of a gatling gun, he tries to be impressive.  The core problem with this game, is that it fails to understand what a power trip is, fails to understand speed, and simply isn't juvenile enough to do any of the things it wants to do.",

Weapons don't have any kick and are ♥♥♥♥. The only good thing isbeing able to hold 4 weapons instead of 2 which made the game like eating ♥♥♥♥ with a cherry on top rather than dead rat. When it comes to enemy types, there are 5 or 6 of them... and I hate all of them. I can also safely say that this game has one of the worst ending ever. Also, there are too many ♥♥♥♥ing around in this game (the whole part in the duke's dream is dumb and pointless) for example to get more health you need to interact with objects in the game and a lot of them requires you to play some stupid ♥♥♥♥ like basketball, Ari hockey, pinball (all of those are ♥♥♥♥ to your information). Also, what ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off like a motherfluffer is the fact that after beating this crap, you gain access to all trailers for this game (because if you didn't know this game took 12 years to ♥♥♥♥ out) and nearly all of those trailers showed games that look like ♥♥♥♥ ton of fun! I never touched multiplayer so if it's like COD 4 and all money went there... I still think it's a piece of ♥♥♥♥ not work 20 €, maybe 0.50 €? or free? Nah, ♥♥♥♥ this game.  ♥♥♥♥ forever/10",
