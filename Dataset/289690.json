            "review_text": "So, I've only played a limited amount of this game, but due to the fact that it just came out, people are obviously going to want some impressions. Also, please note that earlier today I played around the first third of Guardian of Light so I would be prepared to compare the progress made on this game.  TL;DR This game improves on GoL in literally every respect, rendering its predecessor almost obsolete in the process. Breathtaking visuals, refined gameplay, larger and more diverse areas/puzzles, more enemies supported on screen at the same time than GoL really ever managed, 4-player drop in/drop out with public matchmaking support, all for the lowly price of twenty dollars. Avoid using SSAA, as it seems to have very little impact on visual fidelity, make sure you plug in your gamepad, and I can almost promise you will enjoy this game.  *REVIEW STARTS HERE*  First, the negative (and trust me, there isn't much).  -Bad keyboard controls return. The scheme is similar to the first game, and for many that will be a bad thing. Keyboard controls just feel unresponsive and awkward, especially since the way Lara gradually turns while running seems to be designed for an analog stick. Get a controller for this game or you will have a suboptimal experience.  -PERFORMANCE. Okay, I've been seeing some initial feedback saying the performance is not very good. I was worried about this (I have an R9 290x Gaming, i5 4670, and 16 GB Ballistix) because nothing frustrates me more than poor optimization when I have a fairly nice rig. After glancing at the video options, I immediately noticed what the issue is. This game offers two types of anti-aliasing: FXAA and SSAA. Most people will be familiar with FXAA. It is very low cost but also tends to blur the image quite a bit. SSAA (commonly confused with the much less performance heavy SMAA), however, is a little bit more uncommon and is an EXTREMELY performance heavy and ham fisted form of anti-aliasing that usually looks great. I don't see much of a difference here other than a distinct performance drop in some areas while having it on. On my rig, I pull an unwavering 60 FPS with FXAA on. SSAA on drops the framerate in only the most demanding cutscenes.  *EDIT*  I feel like I have to add another negative here, if I am to be completely honest. I gave the multiplayer co-op a shot and... let's just say they could have done better. Now, I could see this game TOTALLY being a blast if you and a friend or two get together and communicate. Right now the solo queue is an absolute mess, though. Players drop in and drop out fairly frequently, which halts the action for a few seconds, and if the host leaves then a new one is picked and progress seems to be reset to the last checkpoint, which can be quite a ways away. Adding to the issue is the fact that these puzzles were not designed with four players in mind (it would have been quite an enourmous task to make puzzles that could be completed with one person but challenged four as well). Both Egyptian gods can wield their own respective staves while both explorers have grappling hooks and can use fire (though I've seen an issue where Lara loses fire and only Carter can use it; I don't know if this is intentional). The biggest issue seems to be a lack of communication and ability spam during complex puzzles. The session I was in consisted of one person who seemed to know how to solve the puzzle, myself, who was trying to figure it out but having difficulty communicating with the leader, and two people who seemed to be actively inhibiting progress by messing with switches, dropping mines, and moving the ball of sunlight to places it did not need to go. Fighting enemies with four players is also quite a mess. Fights are chaotic, yes, but not in the good way. Dying seems almost impossible considering the sheer amound of ammunition being simultaneously fired off and mines annoyingly cause friendly fire, which leads to some serious griefing. All in all, with maybe a single friend, this could be fun. Right now solo queue is a nightmare, though.  *END EDIT*  Now, the good.  -This game is breathtakingly gorgeous. I mean, the screenshots look quite nice, but I never expect the same quality in game. This is an exception. From the minute you run out of the temple and outside into the first level, there is an obvious difference in graphical fidelity between this game and the last installment. The smoke effects are some of the best I have ever seen, textures are of above average quality, and the lighting is spot on. Character models look much better than the first game, though not quite as sharp as the environment (which isn't a problem since this game plays from the isometric perspective).  -Gameplay is smoother and more diverse than the first game (based on my limited experience with it). While the first game had the gimmick with the golden spear, which was essentially a one trick pony, this game features a staff that allows you to interact with certain normally static objects in the world so long as they have Osiris's emblem on them. Co-op features two players wielding the staff, which does cause problems (particularly with there only being a need for one staff, so the other player is left twiddling their thumbs). Dodging, jumping, and especially grappling all feel finely tuned. It should also be noted that the UI is cleaned up, and the gear equipment screen is easier to navigate.  -Level design, I feel, deserves its own category. I have only played roughly half an hour of the game and I have already encounterd larger, more open areas than were available in the first game, twice as many more enemies on screen at the same time than there ever were in Guardian of Light, and very well designed platforming sections. I won't spoil anything, but let's just say that the first chase scene in the game is far more compelling and heart pounding than anything that happened in my time with Guardian of Light (and I do enjoy that game, as well).  -The story is so corny and I absolutely love it. Clearly this isn't a narrative driven game, but the writers still seemed to have some fun with the script and nailed the 'so bad it is good' tone perfectly. Lara, as usual, is her sassy self, but the new Egyptian additions are just a riot, particularly Set. His voice is so goofy and evil-villain-echo-tastic that one could almost not feel threatened by him, if it weren't for the very menacing and threatening demon chasing you for what seems like it will be throughout the game (a wise choice to include this to contrast Set).  -Miscellaneous: The loot early on seems to possess those classic ARPG modifiers ala 'Debilitating Iron Ring of Major Grappling' and so on and so forth, which seems to suggest that there will possibly be LOTS of (perhaps random) loot to collect. There is a nifty matchmaking tool in the main menu for online co-op, which is always welcome. Many of the great features from GoL have returned, such as laying and detonating bombs, carrying four weapons at a time, the ammo meter for secondary weapons, and the collection of gems (though this time they can be used to open chests containing loot; a smart addition).  Overall, I'd say this game is fantastic so far and very much worth the low price tag of twenty dollars. Furthermore, you don't have to have played GoL at all to understand the story. Think of this like a 007 sequel. Sure, if you watch all the movies you will notice a broad timeline and catch on to some of the more prominent tropes, but nothing stopes you from watching them out of order and still knowing exactly what is going on. Keep in mind that co-op with strangers feels disjointed, but great with a friend. I would actually encourage you to buy this game RATHER than GoL, as this improves the gameplay in literally every area, rendering its predecessor almost completely obsolete. Anyway, if you got this far, thanks for sticking with me. Hope you enjoy!",

Didn't crash once. Graphics aren't glitchy. There are a few places where the mechanics could have been touched up, but the game is 100% functional. If they actually built their system maybe they'd know why it's not running properly. That or buy a decent system. This game doesn't have high requirements. Anyhow about the game...  This game is different being that it is an isometric version of Tomb Raider. It feels more like a Diablo game with puzzles. There are 8 main sections of the map which you slowly unlock. As you do you can spend gems on upgrades to gear (amulets and rings) which give you buffs. You also get a variety of different weapons( although throughout the entire game I stuck with the duel pistols).   One thing I did really like about this game are the challenge events. There are obelisks which you can cause enemies to spawn from. Usually this will fill the board with lots of incoming and in some cases the action can get quite intense. I loved having to quickly roll around, drop bombs, and constantly prioritize my targets as they ran quickly towards me.  As for the puzzles, they aren't super complex, but some do make you think a bit. I enjoyed them.  I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes solving puzzles while going through lots of Diablo type action sequences. My only real complaint is that the game is short. I beat it in less than 20 hours.",

Well, if this is the case, then I and my friend were both spectacularly unlucky! This really does seem to be broken.  We bought the game to play cooperatively, online, on two machines with different specs. Both were well above minimum spec, and yet the issues we found were: * Game displays black screen instead of menus etc. (one machine; found a work-around on the forums - this seems to be a common problem) * Painfully slow frame rate (both machines, frequently) * Cut scene dialogue gets out of sync (one machine) * Cut scene dialogue refers to plural people when addressing single person (both machines, single player) * Game inserts second character into game for no apparent reason (seen once, one machine) * Game ceases to recognise XBox360 controller (one machine, once) * Control of characters sluggish (both machines, always)  Those were all encountered in '2 hours' of 'play'. When I say '2 hours' of 'play' I actually logged 29 minutes playing, and spent the rest of the two hours online looking for solutions to these problems (only one viable work around to one issue found in that time - not a good use of an evening.)  This game is *great* as an explanation of why a lot of people pirate games before purchasing them - publishers do themselves no favours releasing games this 'temperamental' (tactful description) and Steam does itself no favours selling it.

I did get it running long enough to play something that was ok, but didn't feel as good as Guardian of Light and was kind of hard on the eyes. I mean that literally - I got eye strain after playing it for an hour. The art direction is fine, but poor antialiasing made it hurt to look at. It also chugged at bit in places, despite my decently powerful PC.  All in all, not terrible, but very marred by technical issues. And what I did get to play didn't feel as good as its predecessor.",
