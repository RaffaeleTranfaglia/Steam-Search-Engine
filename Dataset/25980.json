    "description": "In the world of Majesty, you are the ruler of the kingdom Ardania. At your service are your loyal and somewhat obnoxious subordinates, who have their own minds about how things should be done. In fact, Majesty is the only game where your heroes decide on their own what should be done and when, leaving you to try to control them through...",

            "review_text": "As I see most of reviews here are written by first Majesty fans. I've never played first part and started with Majesty 2 and this review will be for people who just want to know if that's a good game. As you can see I played 50 hours in that game, so this should be some clue. And I need to add that wasn't wasted time for me. Because this is just a great game. It's RTS but works little different to typical in that genre. As a king you show what needs to be done and your heroes will do it on their own, sooner or later. This little difference made this game totally different than other games in the genre. For me that game was quite difficult, but I'm not a RTS expert.  VERDICT: If you like to be a fantasy king, this is the chance to that dream come true. If you're a RTS fan, you should play that game. Especially of the difference I mentioned before.

            "review_text": "I was a big fan of Majesty 1, and thought this would be similar with a few cool additions. Never have I been so wrong. The difficulty curve is insane. Before you even have a chance to build a decent stronghold with some high level heroes, you're being bounded by demon dragons and hellspawn and turn around to find all your bravest heroes cowering in their bunkers...until those are obliterated by demon fire and everyone dies. I thought the best part of Majesty 1 was building a kingdom, seeing your heroes grow and gain experience doing the minor side missions, then after spending a few moments admiring your beautifully rendered castle and surrounding accoutrements, sallying forth to lay waste to the bad guy. I guess they missed that in this one.",

Don't worry, we all had regrets after playing this. There are much better mutiplayer games, don't buy this.",

You get ravaged by monsters and the Boss before you have anything to defend with. And many levels after it are the same. Only way to beat this game is with an extreme learning curve. You must know the entire mission, placement of everything on the map etc, before you even start. The entire idea/point of the game is lost. Impossible to play some levels without following strict uncompromising strategy guides. Majesty 2 had potential to be very cool game. Great idea, style and simple fun game dynamics. But the developers have patched the game to the point some levels are impossible for new players. Majesty 2 is now only playable by highly experienced players.  Idea/Potential/style: 8/10 game difficulty: 1/10 (Impossible for beginners) ",

The main problem really is that your heroes are never where they're needed, or die so much which wastes your resources and creates the graveyard. Just... disappointing.   Maybe try the first game instead.",

The hero incentives are the same. The base building is only slightly altered.   The music is absolutely terrible. I turned it off after 5 minutes. The campaign narration and text might as well not be there. The campaign has no incentive to replay, and the missions are all pretty much the same. Additionally, the lords system is too weak to be useful or fun. The standalone single player missions are probably better than the campaign msisions.  The game's interface has some problems. There is no option to customize hotkeys. There are not hotkeys for frequently clicked spell abilities. The camera movement has no insta-move-- only scroll. There is no hotkey to jump to the last notification message.   The base game is certainly worth the $2.50.   The monster Kingdom expansion is a failure. The monster AI seems to have worse AI than the vanilla. It can be very difficult to get units to attack or explore at times. It has typos in several places. The unit balance has problems. Some missions frequently crash. I'd recommend staying away from the Monster Kingdom expansion.",

THEY WILL NEVER DO ANYTHING ON THEIR OWN. if you want heroes to do, anything, and i mean ANYTHING, even defend their own damn home, you will have to use reward flags. the heroes will not respond to threats even if they are right next to them, and will keep walking as though nothing his happening. heroes will start fights they cannon win and will die constanly, if your building is being attacked, heroes will just ignore it and let it collapse. getting a bunch of heroes to attack a spesific large enemy is rage inducing, because each respond to the reward flags in his own time, so by the time your warriros get to that monster, all the wizards that responded to the flag 5 minutes ago, are already dead.  this can be fixed by forming parties in the inn, but guess what? in order to attarct hero parties to reward flags you needto offer a QUADRUPLE amount of gold than usual, or they will simply ignore it.  and to add insult to injury the game completly lost its serious and immersive tone, and tries to crack cheap, dumb jokes at every possible opportunity, making the game feel like a big, sad, joke.  sure, it worked in magicka, but its because 1) the jokes were actually FUNNY and not cringe inducing, and 2) magicka is not a sequal to a game with rich lore and immserive atmoshpere.  sure Majesty 2 can still be enjoyed, but its a horrible waste of money of you get it for any more that 2$.   5/10",
