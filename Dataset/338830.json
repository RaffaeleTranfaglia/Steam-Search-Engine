Simple reason is that it looks nice, it plays nice, it sounds nice and it costs... nice. :)  The Dev (yes it's just one person) is extremely active, responsive and with an amazing attitude, and that's something not always easy to find.  It clearly is a 'love letter' to old space sims as the description states, just do not expect a flight sim, this is not Elite or Privateer, this is Star Nomad, a fun arcade space sandbox.",

            "review_text": "For me, Star Nomad is an underrated little gem! It takes all the things that make the 2D action/shooter genre great, and condenses them into a simple yet crazy fun experience. You can make your fortune as a miner, trader or even a pirate (Be warned, betraying everyone doesn't end well :P), but cracking on with the story was the most fun for me. Took me around 30 hours to beat it, which considering the price, is a bargain...  Dont let the simple nature of this game fool you, it becomes very challenging as you progress. Early game is all about earning credits and upgrading your ship. Late game is much more about tactical piloting and loadout (and spamming the X key). Some battles might seem too difficult, but keep at it. Theres nothing more satisfying than battling through a dozen battleships with a lone frigate.  Though this game might not be for everyone, if you're into retro style 2D space shooters with simple mechanics, and are willing to rise up to the challenge of restoring peace to the universe (or not), then pick it up and give it a go. I did and I thoroughly enjoyed it.   Now to uncover the myth of the nude key combo...",

            "review_text": "Just another bad touch-screen game that someone thought would be worthwhile to port to PC. Avoid this game, and wait for a deal on the far superior Space Pirates and Zombies. This is basically Space Rangers with one button.  That'll teach me to buy a game with woman plastered all over it, like some kind of browser-based monstrosity. I really think it's some kind of law of gaming: If a product is draped with women (as sex objects, not people) all over, it will be bad. The less clothing the women have, the worse it will be. If the clothing makes no sense (eg boob chainmail) you would get more enjoyment out of your money by burning it.  I've been calling it the boobmail law, but whatever. It's my fault for buying this hot mess.",
