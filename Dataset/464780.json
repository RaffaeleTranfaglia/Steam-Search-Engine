I enjoyed every single part of the history. I totally identified with main character. Haven't played chapter 2 and 3 yet and I don't know if I trurly want- not because of price to spend but rather because I felt in love along with main character and I don't know if I can accept another possible route (who ended ch 1, should undertand what I mean). The ending was emotional masterpiece- one of the best I have ever seen.",

This game doesn't show as much nuditiy as you think it would but the story makes it up for that; though the story can be boring at times and I just spam click while trying to read all the text, it usually works out in the end.  Why did the main character go for the MILF? Why did he succeed?   (teach me your ways, sensei)   You could obviously tell that some of the girls were interested in him. And by some, I mean more than half. How does it not see that? Even the loli girls were going for him, 2 EVEN!  10/10 would face palm again everytime I cringe when a new girl shows up with big exposed breasts.",

            "review_text": "ChuSingura 46+1 S is a visual novel developed by Inre. For those new to this concept, visual novels are interactive games that have very few choices if any at all. The concept might seem boring, but those interested in books ChuSingura is a jewel among VNs. It is also one of the games that will make you think of your own life and wonder what would you do different if you could travel back in time?  The main protagonist is Fukami Suguha, an average Japanese student that ends up transported back in time during the Genroku era in 1701 CE. The story essentially deals with the 47 Ronins and their plans to avenge their lord unjustly while also restoring the family’s honor. It is a story of courage, bravery, romance, mystery, magic and duty.   The game is excellent when it comes to provoking emotions in the player thanks to the amazing special effects used when the samurai are fighting with their swords, the music and the imagery. Some moments will be so touching that the player will shed tears.   I personally did not encounter any bugs with the game, but there were some minor translation errors, although nothing major.  Each chapter of ChuSingura is excellent and so far I played the 3 released. I think it is worth giving a try considering the fact chapter 1 is free for everyone and chapter 2 and 3 are bundled for 20$. Each chapter deals with the same story but someone else’s perspective as well as different events.   Overall, I think ChuSingura is one of the best visual novels I’ve read and I would gladly recommend it to anyone (heck, first chapter is free, so why not?). I give the game overall with its dlc a 9.5 (lost 0.5 for the minor translation errors). It is a must have in your collection. ",

Mind that there are fantasy elements similar to the movie of the same story which came some years ago.  I must admit that i really got hooked into the story, the Voice acting, the characters, and the music, specially this last one are very well done and i found them quite charming.  Ejem* Naturally, there is a slight amount of fanservice, not a big deal annyway,   or it is?.    The first chapter is free and it have a very acceptable duration to introduce the first and probably most important part of the story, is a great oportunity to go and try if you are into Visual novels, i asure you if you get into it, the ending will result so cliffhanger, i`m looking for the others chapters now.",

HOWEVER,if this game can give me a choice to interact with other girls would be great. another thing i dislike in this VN is no archievement and Trading Card which put me off from buying the DLC. i mean sure the story is great however the lack of choice in interacting with other girls really hold me off from purchasing the game . If there is a trading Card or archievement maybe i will purchase it but hey i recomend it to people to try it first. Even if there is no H scene,im fine with that cause i do some research already,the art is not that great to me to have H/eroge in it. the story is what matter. in the end it really do tale a part of history of japan regarding the fate of 47 ronin. even IF you Cut the White Serpent BS.",

First off, yes, get it, it's wonderful.  It's an emotional rollercoaster, definitely. You'll feel love and happiness and hope and sadness, possibly all at once. Personally, I sort of fell in love with Chikara and Shinroku, but there's redeeming qualities in all the characters. It's a linear VN with no choices, but I felt engaged with the story and I was interested all the way through, despite that.  It's a marathon, but it keeps you into it until the very end. I won't spoil it for you, but the ending may surprise you.  By the end, I felt a connection to Suguha and all the girls (and Kitchenman, but we don't talk about him.)  The storytelling is very good at its core, despite the occasional spelling error or translation bug. Some words used by the Ronin hadn't even been invented yet (like 'awesome') but I think I can give it a pass since it doesn't affect the storytelling.  This game appeals to anime fans, history lovers, or the offhand VN enthusiast.   10/10, would cry again and tell my girlfriend that I love her out of the sadness this VN gave me.",

            "review_text": "  Chusingura46+1 S   is a visual novel brought to life by   Inre   and published by   NextNinja   [for Steam] that introduces the readers to the life of a high school student who is transported 300 years back into the “body of a samurai” during the Edo period, where the story is a revival of the epic tale   Ronin 47   in which the characters are inexplicably female!  There are several compliments that I have, where the first is how engaging the story develops from the voice acting and dialogue. Unlike visual novels that we would normally read, these voice actors give the characters personality to the extent where most of the time it stimulates my curiosity to know more on how characters we are introduced to develop as the story progress. Another positive feature with regards to   Chusingura46+1 S   are the options given when reading the visual novel. We are given the power to change our experience on how the visual novel is illustrated (   which includes the speed of message display, volume, language for the dialogue and vice versa   ), and as for myself, I have opted of my experience to the point where I was watching a movie. Speaking of features, we are also given a biography “section” of all the characters introduced, which allows us to understand a characters role in the story, a characters history, and their motives.   However where there is good, there is always room for improvement.   The only issue I’ve discovered when reading the visual novel is through the “auto play” option  . There are a few sections of the story where the voice and the dialogue are not in sync, sometimes the dialogue go way faster than the scripted voice completing his/her sentence, which causes an unusual overlap between voices. Be diligent when using this feature until an update is made to fix this minor issue.  I would highly suggest anyone who have an interest in visual novels to give   Chusingura46+1 S   a try as the first chapter is free, but as for my experience, I am very keen on purchasing the official release of this product.",

It has a good quality feel to it with voice acting throughout and high quality art The developer has been clever using the fan service to get a much loved story moved back into the limelight, making it accessible to the disaffected Japanese youth and as a side effect opened it up to the western markets as well (although the localisation and 'all ages' conversion has lost quite a bit from the original). The translation is pretty garbled in the last two chapters and needs to be reworked.
