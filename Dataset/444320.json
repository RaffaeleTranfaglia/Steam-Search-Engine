Another fullscreen game where the mouse is not constrained to the window/monitor. So yeah, have fun moving the camera and tabbing yourself out. Also controls are not clearly listed ingame, only in the Unity launcher. Yay. Music is meh, animations of dancing on main menu has random jerkiness that returns the model to the origin point.  Needs some serious work.",
