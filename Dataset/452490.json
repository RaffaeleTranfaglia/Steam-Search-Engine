No, look, it is a short experience that is sort of interesting, if a little bit frustrating. There are times when it is patiently wating for you to trigger the next event, and it isn't always clear what the trigger might be. In the meantime, you would do well to pay attention to the world around you. You are almost guaranteed to miss out on a few details the first time.  In the end, you get something a little bit like a shorter, more limited, narratorless Stanley Parable. So, you can see there's some art to it, but then again, Stanley Parable with a narrator would be pretty empty.  That's what you get out of this experience: Empty. ",

It is clearly for people who are looking for a more subtle, narrative kind of experience. But it manages to pull of a kind of intimiate, one-man-show theatrical experience. It's really effective.
