One of the bestselling Tomb Raider games Tomb Raider 2 improves on the original, with new weapons like the harpoon gun, grenade launcher and M4, new graphic enhancements like gun flash and flairs. And for the first time in Tomb Raider Lara has a few costume changes along the way.  You join Lara on another globetrotting adventure to recover the dagger of Xian. A mythical dagger that would turn you into a dragon if you plunged it into your heart.  I feel that Tomb Raider 2 is one of the best Tomb Raider games of all time :)",

This is quite a long game (i have yet to finish it, half way though at the time of this review) As with the first game, this isn't an easy one and there is a few timing jump that can be a bit tricky but the controls are very responsive. Worth noting, the expansion pack The Golden Mask isn't included in the Steam version Lastly, even if the game can be play at 1080p, it doesn't support widescreen resolution.",

Avid player way back when, on the PS1, must admit it is a little more tricky using a keyboard, especially as a wasd layout is definitely NOT recommended ('S' used to be the screenshot key on the original PC release of this game, and there isn't a way of disabling it, causing intermittent crashing if pressed (and no screenshot!)  Fantastic gameplay, interesting levels, great music. Just be sure to look up the widescreen fix - shame this wasn't done for this steam re-release.  And such a shame we don't get achievements like the Android version.",

When i finally did it i just said to myself that it wasn't worth it and i wasn't going to force myself to play it. Sum up=Controls are horrible not worth getting on pc, get on ps1",

            "review_text": "TLDR: Amazing story, fantastic level design, capturing puzzles... way too many baddies at the end of the game that detract from the experience  Tomb Raider II is an action/adventure that focuses heavily on puzzle solving and precarious platforming. Prepare to be jumping over large pits, avoiding rolling boulders, and shooting at seemingly random placed baddies. Also get ready to be hitting that save button a lot to avoid long and tedious do overs. This game has an AMAZING story and the level design is very well done. There is a really good balance between trying to find the hidden doors, the right buttons, and that one key you need to continue, and fighting the good variety of baddies that you'll be encountering. This game also had a little scare factor. With little to no background music, solving the puzzles can become quite relaxing until that BLARING alert music starts warning you of a nearby spawned enemy which had me jumping more than occasionally. This game however does have some drawbacks. The camera angles can be REALLY annoying and you'll be going around corners firing just to make sure there arent any enemies down that way. The number of enemies near the end of the game can also be a bit absurd and you'll need some fancy aerobics to avoid attacks and still getting the shots off you need.",

Along this trek, you encounter an Italian mob who are also after the very item you seek. The slight improvements in this game, creates some new thrills. That said, the game is just as hard as the original, but still a rewarding experience to master. The thing I like most about the game is that the mansion level is more open than in the original that allows you to see more of Lara's home. Overrall, this is a good for anyone who likes the original.",

A simple mistep can cause you to fall and die many times, and there are moments of constant danger, like some underwater sections and such. It's just a bliss, very carefully made.
