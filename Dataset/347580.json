            "review_text": "Game needs a lot of work to get in a more playable state. Currently, things seem very broken, you randomly have to recreate a lifeform, the change to family member just changes you to a random ai that isn't the same lifeform you made, and a lot of the parts don't seem to work right. Sad thing is the game isn't even marked as early access...  Seems like the cell stage of spore with more advanced features; just needs a lot of work to become playable.  Is currently no mouse support, looks like a quick port from a phone game. Other than that, seems like a game with a lot of potential, and I really hope this dev sticks around! Love the idea!  No other reviews because the dev never even bothered patching the game with steam. Therefore, steam does not even read that your playing it, thus you can't reach the 5 minute time cap for a review. Did a hacky method to get around this ;).   Is a very early access (appears to be a prototype build) game. Do not purchase unless you want to watch as the game developes, while supporting game development at the same time.",
