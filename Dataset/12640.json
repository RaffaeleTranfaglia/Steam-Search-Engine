            "review_text": "A party based RPG with great potential but quite unfinished and unpolished. Some people compare it to DA:O, NWN, BG, etc...(that being the reason I bought it) but that's a big overstatement.  The bad:  1. The story/main quest - linear, blurry and uninteresting - does little to motivate the player to save the world. 2. The side quests are scarce, petty, uncomplicated and unrewarding. 3. The companions are plain, stereotyped and boring. They have no personal quests (except one), don't develop with the progress in the game, rarely have something to say about quests/environment. Puppets with no personality, no conflicts, no banters, no life. The majority of them can be recruited too late in the game, so, for the first half, you will probably be stuck with the barking amazon and the cliché dwarf. 4. There is no character customization in terms of appearance. 5. The voices are simply horrible. Luckily, the English version of the game has very few voiced lines but this breaks the atmosphere, of course. 6. The loot consists mostly of crafting stuff or cheap and unusable items. It is also unevenly distributed, there are large areas with only 3 plants and a chest and others (locked ones) with so much loot that your inventory limit is exceeded. The game encourages you to pick-pocket everyone, but fails to mention that there are only 5 NPCs worth stealing. (How much fluff does one have to steal in order to buy an Amulet of Courage?) The equipment is mostly generic and there are only a handful of special or enchanted items. The only set, main-quest-related, enchanted full armor looks terrible and only fitting for a warrior (additionally, at the end of the game someone had the great idea to transform it into some sort of all-or-nothing jump-suit, robbing you of the possibility to wear only parts of it). Rummaging through the game data base I've found too many items and crafting recipes which have been left out and this is sad, because this game could benefit greatly from extra content. 7. Most areas are locked after finishing the corresponding main-quest part. I can't phantom the reason behind this. 8. Rogue considerations: a) stealth is useless in terms of combat or stealing, it only comes handy in certain scripted conditions. You may unrealistically steal items in front of people with no penalty whatsoever; b) there is NO double-wielding; c) there is a large variety of traps but no reason, opportunity or fun to use them; d) disarming traps, picking locks, etc... brings no XP. 9. Strange behaving camera in buildings and underground. 10. Disappearing corpses during cut-scenes.  The good:  1. The visuals are still sharp after so many years. 2. The music is fine and contributes to the game atmosphere. 3. The people responsible with level/area design did a great job. Actually the music and the scenery are the only ones that create a positive atmosphere. The story and the characters subtracts from this instead of enriching it. 4. The ability and spell checks system, though unnecessary complicated, make sense after you've understood them (except for harvesting plants - that's just plain stupid) 5. The training-based talents. 6. Gwendala - a healing mage/archer is an excellent companion; she also looks good. 7. The combat is challenging at times but gets repetitive.  Conclusion: Buy/play Drakensang only if on sale and if you don't have great expectations. It is playable and almost bug free but lacks the level of detail, complexion and entertainment other genre related games (even older) have. I've had more fun modding it than playing it. ",

            "review_text": "It was a game I approached many times and never got around to play all the way until few years later. I did not like the customization of characters at first as there were many unexplained features. I played as a mage and at the end I still had to make my mage a fighter teaching her all defensive skills. Game was long, sometimes tedious, but at the end it was quite ok. I would recommend it to RPG fan but there are far better games out there to play.",

Recently, I was looking for a good computer adaptation of this game and tried different titles - Drakensang is the best one I found, by far! It offers an interesting story, decent graphics and an implementation of the DSA skill and attribute system that is both transparent and true to the original. The freedom to create your own character (not possible in many of Drakensang's competitors!) and put together your party of four out of a diverse selection of followers captures the RPG feeling I am accustomed to very well.  If you are looking for a DSA video game, or just a nicely crafted fantasy RPG, and you do not mind an engine that is a little old, you should choose this one!",

The rule set is a refreshing change of pace for those used to D&amp;D, and i found the gameplay very entertaining. Graphics are good, story, and character develpopement are all positive features. Aside from the awkward voice acting, the ending was pretty much an abrupt congratulations, and not much else. But i found the story, gameplay and system good enough to oveshadow its flaws. Overall a nice little gem, though its sequal The River Of Time is a better effort by a developer that sadly went out of buisness before this game series could catch on.",

            "review_text": "This game is dull. From the incessant fights against uninteresing enemies (wolves, rats, and bandits, mostly) to the boring and unimpressive spells, and the underwhelming combat moves, the game is dull. The game's storytelling is also dull. The characters are fairly boring themselves. If you decide to play it, whatever you do, don't decide to ask a character's backstory. What you'll get is a tedious dialogue that reveals nothing about the game world and nothing interesting about the character. If you're like me, and you're looking for a CRPG to pass the time, then I suppose this game will do. But the pace is slow and nothing about it has yet to enrapture me. I'd reinstall Neverwinter Nights 2, but that would take me forever and NWN2 has its own issues (bugs, mostly). But at least NWN2 has some interesting abilities for your character. Not so here. I've looked online out of sheer frustration, and it seems the most interesting spell the game can give you is some kind of fireball. Woo. A fireball. The game has nothing with more pizazz than that, I'm afraid. Otherwise, the game will keep you busy. There's plenty of uninteresting sidequests, and the main quest seems pretty long. Unfortunately, busy doesn't mean entertained. I really wish somebody would make some more CRPGs of the caliber of the first Neverwinter Nights (not the multiplayer one) and Dragon Age: Origins. But I guess making fun videogames is hard, so it's unlikely we'll see much of that. Anyways, back to Drakensang: The combat is turnbased and rather clunky. Casting spells seems to take several rounds, which is quite frustating considering that the duration of debuffs is about as long. So by the time you've cast your weeny cold ray on an enemy (assuming you haven't been interrupted, since the cold ray spell has an exceedingly short range in addition to a long casting time), the distracting shock spell you've cast upon your opponent will have run out. Your party members then have fifteen secodns to take advantage of your enemy's momentary weakness.  Expect lots of waiting around for your character to get his turn to strike. There doesn't appear to be any significant player choice in the game, beyond turning down quests. So if you weren't allowed to wander aimlessly, this would effectively be a linear game.  So: don't buy. It's a waste of time and money. Unless you're like me and you're unemployed and you need something to kill the time that can run on your dated computer, fun be damned.",
