            "review_text": "[Spoiler-Free Review]  Perhaps the biggest consideration before starting out with an RPG nowadays is, 'Can I find time to finish this game?' As much as I adore the old SNES RPG’s for instance, I can’t really go back and play through them anymore; too big a commitment. Disregard that concern for Boot Hill Heroes. Between the hats, the music, and the characters, your time is well spent playing this game. Setting an RPG in the spaghetti west just makes so much sense!  So what do you need to know beforehand?   Times have changed.  Boot Hill Heroes is a modern RPG designed as a sort of homage to the glory days of the Role Playing and Wild West genres. The storyline is easy to follow and progresses at a snappy pace, the difficulty is forgiving (for the most part), and while it doesn’t allow for true  ‘save anywhere!’  functionality, you’ll never feel locked-in to a play session beyond what your time allows. Despite being a linear experience overall, the game still manages to deliver a large scope RPG  feel  (complete with unique characters and game mechanics, twists and turns). Did I mention it can be played with up to four people simultaneously?   It isn’t just an Earthbound clone.  It’s easiest to draw associations between this game and Earthbound/Mother; the graphic style alone! Setting that aside however, what really distinguishes this game is the setting. The story features big entrances and over-the-top performances from a cast of characters the likes of which you’d expect to find in Vaudeville. I won’t give anything away but the characters (esp. the villains) are the true stars of the game and they don’t disappoint.   This game has heart!  Every character in the game is completely unique (in appearance and dialogue). It’s hard to imagine how much work went into creating a world, one character and one house at a time. Some of those efforts are obvious; you walk into a building and find the place has been meticulously decorated and arranged. It's not like you're going to stay over for dinner or anything, but you'll notice people's houses aren't cookie-cutter. In addition to the dinnerware, you’ll find livestock penned in barns and stables, people working the farms and such: towns feel alive.   Hat Mechanic  Hats are the means by which your characters change their appearances and acquire new abilities. They’re equipped, but don’t produce any defensive bonuses. This is crucial to what makes them work, once you've unlocked the skills associated with a new hat, you can choose to wear another hat for purely aesthetic purposes. In this way, you'll never have to worry about hats being outclassed by others discovered down the line. It’s a system that encourages experimentation. Receiving new hats throughout your adventure never feels old, you'll rush to try each one on as soon as you get them. Unfortunately there is some overlap in unlocked abilities so not every hat provides you with a completely new set of unlearned skills.   The writing is clever and witty!  Especially in battles where enemies are introduced and later eulogized depending on your performance. I wish there was a greater variety of phrases rather than one or two for each type of foe, but I always looked forward to seeing how they would come to grips with being defeated: I know at least one or two lives were changed thanks to my relentless beatings.  Dialogue could use a bit of tightening up overall. In battles you'll sometimes get a message detailing every aspect of what an enemy attack does. Lick is probably the most egregious example of what I’m trying to describe here, “Weak physical damage with small chance for confusion that slightly heals the user.” Thankfully, the developer has demonstrated a willingness to address issues as they're identified.   The graphics in battles aren’t the best…  A bit rough around the edges shall we say? Don’t expect to be blown away. Some of the enemies look like they were created in MS Paint. In addition, the font style (all caps, some spacing issues) makes it somewhat difficult to read what’s being said at times. I’m not saying you can’t read it, I’m saying you’ll appreciate how easy it is to read text in other games.   The Music/Soundtrack!!!  Does the industry have an award for Videogame Music of the Year? What won? This is better.   Missing content from PS Vita version?  This is the definitive package, all content released on other platforms is being included in the Steam release.   Post-Release Support?  Boot Hill Heroes Part 1 is finished but new features have been added post-release (including a new mini map feature in the latest patch). Since the game is being spread out over multiple episodes, the developer has seen fit to reward early adopters by offering each DLC release free at launch (free for one week), the price then becomes $0.99 each. What does this mean? Buy the game now and get all future episodes for free.   TLDR:  If you've got any interest in RPG games of old, get Boot Hill Heroes. This game is special.",

            "review_text": "I bought this game because it was the only one appearing researching 'Earthbound', At first I didn't think so, but now I do think it reminds me of Earthbound, one of the best RPG I have ever played (I am speaking about the SNES game). It's original, lots of humour, nice charactors. I am loving it  Some days later... I have finished the game.. not really. The game has not a real end and you'll fight most of the outlaws (all but one) in the next episodes. I am not too disappointed as I look forward to playing Boot Hill 2 and 3. It means this beautiful game is not over! I read there is a new DLC coming soon and I'll check the page everyday",

            "review_text": "Very good game indeed. Maybe the finest example this far on what the aging RPGmaker engine can do when the game is done with attention to detail and love. Do note though that some reviews have noted the abrupt ending of the game so consider the price closely what you wish to pay for this. I got mine in a bundle for a very cheap price and for that price it has this far been a real blast. But full price might be a bit too much for some.   Game itself is a bit clicheey in that the protagonist character is just named 'Kid' and you 'need to save the farm' and your dear ol' ma'. But it's quite entertaining nevertheless to go out and do the plot. Not that much freeroaming as combat is avoidable mostly if you wish and placed in transit areas between safer places. Combat itself is enjoyable as it is different from other similar games with it's stoppable real-time system.   As a 'lets try something entirely different' RPG this is a good candidate. Check out gameplay vids. the combat especially.",

The combat is quick and engaging, the setting is an Earthbound-inspired Old West, and the characters are colorful and enjoyable (if maybe a bit conventional).  My biggest complaint thus far is that there's an achievement for having 50 eggs and the achievement title in no way references 'Cool Hand Luke.'",
