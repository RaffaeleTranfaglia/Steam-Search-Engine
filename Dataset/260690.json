I remember playing it as a kid so when i saw the combo deal of DarkFall 1 and 2 i had to pick them up. It was pretty fun. The puzzles were good and well designed and weren't so obtuse that you need a guide to get through them. The story is very interesting, and each note or letter you find makes you feel as though you're slowly fitting together the pieces of a big puzzle. The characters are interesting, even if you're interactions with them are limited to sorting through their belongings. The voice acting could use some work, but it's a pretty old game so I cut it some slack there.",

Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.",
