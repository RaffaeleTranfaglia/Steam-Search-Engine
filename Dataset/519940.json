            "review_text": "UPDATED: New release brings needed fix, joy and much fun!  Performance is excellent now (GTX 980/ i7-6800k)   -------------------------------------  The good: the game concept is obviously excellent. a nice twist being able to arbitratily rotate the pieces.   The bad: Absolutely horrible performance/lag. The game was essentially unplayable. The first time I played it, I could only take a minute or two before thowing in the towel. the frame rate was so bad the right eye rendering was at times in a totally different place.   Many others complained about the performance issue and after a month, a single post from the developer saying it was fixed, but it wasn't. so i can't recommend the game based on the responsivness of the developer.  Really unfortunately since the graphics of the game really shouldn't be very challenging. After building a brand new VR system i gave it another try (from intel Q9450/GTX 980 -&gt;intel 6800k/GTX980) is was playable (still just barely). The fact that a big bump in performance resulted from just CPU upgrade points something being unoptimized and (needlessly) very CPU bound.  Hopefully the developer will actually fix it. would be more than glad to revise my review.   Net/Net: if you have really big CPU it's (barely) playable; developer wasn't responsive to addressing complaints from many buyers",
