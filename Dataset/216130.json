            "review_text": "I'd like to post a review, but I can't play it. Apparently, a very common problem with this game is that it won't let you register the CD-key. You have to register an account with the developer (even if you just wanna try the single player campaign), and the registration system is broken. It seems you can fix it by contacting support by email, but let's be honest: If you can't even get past the main menu without contacting support because of a bug that is still around after more than two years, is it really worth the effort? I think not.  TL;DR This is broken. Don't waste your money.",

While gameplay is good for an indie game it is not worth even a small amount of money considering the number of restrictions the creators put on the game. When games use too much DRM like this you basically buy the game to not play it.",
