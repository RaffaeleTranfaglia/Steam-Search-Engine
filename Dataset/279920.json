            "review_text": "4 out of 5 stars. I don't own an occulus rift, so I can't rate it on that experience. I can however rate it on its gameplay.  I find Infinity runner is a game best entered with few expectations. It promises pretty much what you think it does. Its a first person action running simulator.  That said, its an on rails obstical course with an interesting twist. The werewolves in space theme allows you to turn into a hulking werewolf mid-run, and change many of the rules in your favor, as it should. The combat in the game (yes, it has combat) is in the form of QTEs depending on the position and number of enemies in a room. If you succeed the challenge, you are rewarded with a smash and kill style fight as your avatar kills everyone in the room and continues to run at break neck speeds.  Yes, you are running at break neck speeds as any failure to react correctly to the environment as it explodes around you is an instant death. Thankfully you as a player are barely penalised, as you are almost immediately put back into sonic speeds at revival. I rate this game highly because I believe it accomplised its goal almost entirely. I found myself glued to the screen, not trying to contemplate what was going on in the world, but instead reacting to my immediate environment. Each level brings its own style of obsticals, from literally jumping through space to sliding under gunships as they lay fire down on my naked body.  I wouldn't play this game for the lore, but why would you? This is a game meant to be played for about 20 minutes at a time, and is very satisfying as that. RUN!",

            "review_text": "Infinity Runner is (as you've probably guessed) an endless runner where the gimmick is that you're playing a werewolf IN SPACE. There's a bit of a story but it's pretty sparse and really an excuse to get to the running. Overall I found the running really fun. The backdrops are all pretty interesting in a sort of pulp sci-fi way (though sometimes on your first run it's hard to tell how to navigate some of the obstacles).   There is a lives system where you can die a certain amount of times and go back to a previous checkpoint rather than having to restart. The lives system seemed a bit unnecessary and I think I would have preferred (at least for story mode) to have infinite lives and just go back to the last checkpoint every time and maybe lose some points or something. Combat is executed by QTEs and the final boss fight killed me enough times that I had to restart the level a few times and that was a bit irritating.  Running feels great and navigating obstacles without losing momentum is super fun, but the mouse/keyboard controls can be a bit awkward. The game might feel a bit smoother with a controller.  The arcade mode is a true endless runner where you run through the different sections of the ship until you run out of lives, and I think that's where the game really shines. In arcade mode you can choose to turn combat off if you'd prefer to not have to deal with the QTEs.  There is a multiplayer mode of some kind but I didn't try it so I don't have an opinion on it.",

            "review_text": "This game will make you feel like you've run a million miles without getting up from the comfort of your computer. I've never really been attracted to the whole 'runner' style of game as it seems repetitive and dull but Infinity Runner smashes those clichés and really grabs you right from the off.   Your main objective is to run down a spaceship in an attempt to escape. Sounds simple but man is it frustrating. The game slowly introduces new aspects and mechanics, which keep it fresh and enjoyable, QTE sequences, that you will be praying for more of and then it throws in a werewolf for good measure. A werewolf in space! Why wouldn’t you be interested?  The games aesthetics are really beautiful and the quality of the animations and voice acting are remarkable. The soundtrack is fantastic, especially when you’re running at that speed, and so making a massive jump or avoiding deadly lasers really makes you feel like a boss.  A really enjoyable game for a good price and I will definitely be recommending it. I can’t wait to check out what Wales Interactive have got planned next.",

The werewolf portions make you feel invincible. Worth the sale price right now of $2.37  Supports controllers and also supports VR.  Unfortunately, like any runner game on mobile or on Steam, it gets repetitive. It was a chore to finish as it's the same thing over and over but just faster to try to keep your reflex on edge but it's super cheap so whatever.",

Why would you do this first off, that says enough but lets say more. This game has, and had, the potential to be an amazing game. They could've made a Mirrors edge type deal with this game and they failed to see this. I for one love the idea of werewolves so I hopped in the game as soon as it came out and I am dissappointed. Like I said again it isn't good but ti isn't a bad game. OVER ALL MY SCORE FOR THIS GAME IS A 5",
