    "description": "In Fuego, you and an opponent create a tangled Mexican standoff one animal-bandito at a time. And when everyoneâ€™s got their mark, the bullets fly. You shoot a bank, you get the gold. You shoot a bandito, you steal the gold. Just make sure that when the dust settles, your gang walks away with the bigger haul.",
