WARNING SPOILERS  You are an unnamed agent (we'll call him Lance) sent to a planet crontrolled by a hostile military force to...do something, I assume destroy the expiremental weapon they've developed. You job is to control Lance and get him to their center of operations and destroy that weapon.",

The physical interactions with environmental objects are frustrating, and I was very often finding myself trying to wiggle my way into a pile of junk to pick up health or ammo that got buried, or even worse, trying to wiggle my way OUT of a pile of junk when I got trapped, pushing boxes out of the way, getting over trees and various physical obstacles, etc. The controls on the wolves/in mechs are AWFUL, so much that I didn't see any point in using them other than jumping higher/further with the wolf. The weapons are decent and varied, but all in all I'd say this is just a glorified generic internet flash game with presentable visuals and a very dull, uninspired, and even annoying soundtrack. It's not a very long game, but I still didn't feel like it was worth the time.",

The logistics of the best way to fight enemies gives me a headache. You have to look where you are shooting to hit things while looking at where you are to avoid getting hit which is impossible for the brain/eyes to handle. Compare this to Contra where you don't really need to try to aim much and mostly just concentrate on dodging. Another thing is that everything blends together visually. Everything is just a mess of colours and you don't know whether it is an enemy, projectile, or crate unless you are directly looking at it. Games like this usually use some sort of system so that everything can be quickly identify based on colour. Also the music is really obnoxious. Everything about this game is really annoying and is an absolute pain to play. Did the game devs just not understand very basic concepts like flow and game feel?  Some games are fun to play, some games are boring, some games are poorly designed and unplayable. This game is somehow in a new category that is functional but mentally painful to play. I give it 1 headache out of 5.",

This is a prime example of 'less = more'  If the firing controls were limited to up, down, left, right and in between instead of this 360 degree aiming reticle, it would be a hell of a lot easier to play and more enjoyable.  I really want to love this but I just can't.   It's cheap enough to try once, hell you might like it. Unfortunately this just isn't for me.

Really great, well paced action, excellent variety of enemies and scenarios, manic and satisifying boss fights and lovely character design and graphics (particlarly the robots, of which there are many). Only downside is that its a bit short, but the content makes up for that. Worth every cent.",

            "review_text": "The Genre: Keyboard/mouse or twin-stick shooting physics platformer.   The Awesome: Crazy over the top enemy wave and boss design. The first boss is an elaborate, punishing, multi-stage battle where you keep thinking it's dead and it just...keeps...coming! Then it finally dies and you think perhaps the next level will get off to a more relaxing start, and instead you find yourself careening downhill on a fragment of the boss you just killed, while ninjas lob increasingly dangerous explosives at you...and then there are some airstrikes...and then the airstrikes start to include missiles that turn into giant robot snakes. I still haven't gotten past the snakes, so I don't know what else that sequence might hold, but it inspired me to write a review.   The Good: All the things you can do with the game's physics. Lots of movable/destroyable objects, vehicles, enemies with individually destroyable, independently moving sections.  The Bad: The physics and controls feel very loose and floaty. Movement could be tighter and objects could feel like they have more weight and heft. Sometime you try to jump and it doesn't quite happen. It doesn't generally prevent you from being able to move around and do skillful things, but it is annoying.   The Ugly: The game autosaves at checkpoints, and they are very far apart. There are more frequent checkpoints that you return to when you die, but if you actually quit the game, you may find yourself much further back. Some people may appreciate this feature, since it makes the game more challenging and perhaps increases playtime, while others may be annoyed by it.   Verdict: The ideas in here are so cool...with a little bit of tolerance for the imperfect controls/physics you can have a lot of fun with it...especially if you can let your imagination fill in some of the gaps between the execution and the level of awesomeness that the game is aiming at (and mostly achieves).",

Does it have some of the greatest boss battles I've ever seen? Yes. Does it make you feel like a badass? GOD yes. THE CONS: It is far too short.  Basically, if it's on sale, it's really worth getting-- one of the best games I've played all year, and definitely the best of this genre that I've ever played. It just isn't long enough, and though there is some replay value, going for a highscore just doesn't appeal to me. If it's not on sale... eh.",

            "review_text": "For a game built on Flash by a single Russian guy over the course of two years, Intrusion 2 quite the product.   It plays like a crossover between Contra and Metal Slug. There's not much of a story - you're basically some mercenary with a red scarf sent to a part-forest, part-tundra planet to shoot the crap outta everything, with no narration as to why. But the old school games never did bother with such details, did they? It's short (only 6 levels in total), and aside from the achievements you won't have much reason to replay it, but the experience is fun enough to deserve the purchase. That's about my only complaint, because everything else is just minor gripes.  Each level throws you into over-the-top situations that would feel right at home in some anime or AAA-title setpiece. It's slightly more forgiving, though - there are no limited lives to worry about, no one-hit deaths, checkpoints, and you can save your progress. It has it's tough spots, but nothing that feels unfair or too frustrating. The game also has a physics engine, and it's put to good use. One memorable moment has you traversing a series of floating pontoons over waters infested with large, hostile marine life, while also dealing with enemy soldiers. Since the pontoons keep bouncing around in the water and react the weight of whatever's on them or any nearby explosions, it's possible to knock enemy guards into the water and see them get eaten up by the wildlife. And while on land, the physics engine also applie to any crates, barrels, eplosive propane tanks, or uneven boulders lying around, meaning you can easily weaponize the environment in often goofy ways.  Just like in Metal Slug, there's vehicles to use, this time in the form of a couple of mechs to drive, including a giant wolf which you can mount and ride. And yes, he even chews on enemy soldiers if you let him.   The enemies deserve some mention. While the typical soldiers you'll be gunning down en-masse aren't anything special, the robotic foes are. Many of them have limbs and weakspots which can be individually targeted, and will continue flailing around, trying to pursue you even if their legs/tentacles/arms/whatever have been entirely blown off. The amount of persistence they show is notable as well - once these guys pop up, you'd best try and get rid of them, because they WILL chase you to the end of each level if allowed.  And the final boss? Well let's just say it's got a reputation for being one of the longest, craziest and overall-awesome final boss fights in recent history for those who've beaten it. Heck even the prior two boss fights are pretty damned good!    TL;DR? If you're a fan of old-school sidescrolling shooters, Intrusion 2 is good enough to recommend grabbing even without a Steam Sale going on.",

While it's not strictly a retro game, it takes obvious influence from games like metal slug and contra and it's not ashamed of it. And thankfully, intrusion 2 is not afraid of going over the top with it's action. Riding giant wolves into battle? Check. Fighting flying helicopters with giant arms? Check. Hijacking missle launching robots with huge machine guns? Check. I can not stress how freaking awesome you feel playing this game. You feel like John Rambo and Dwayne Johnson had a kid who only ate muscle milk and watched Arnold Schwarzenegger movies every day. You feel like the physical manifestion of all the coolest things all the coolest people have ever said, with a sprinkle of grenade launchers and rifles from the future. It starts off simply enough, parachuting onto a snowy mountain fightining little robots with a pistol; but soon enough you'll be taking out giant robo snakes, fighting soldiers with jetpacks and dodging piranhas. This game is difficult, but it's so much fun who cares? Just get it and revel in your own badassery.",
