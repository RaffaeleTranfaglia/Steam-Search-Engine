            "review_text": "MOAI: Build Your Dream is an easy little time-management simulation with cute, colorful graphics and a fun little island theme. Through the game, you build up little island villages and defend them from ghosts and bandits, all while collecting and trading resources to fulfil the goals of each level. Completing the levels is easy, completing them in the fastest time is a bit more difficult.  It's a fun casual-style game with a cute theme that tests your multi-tasking and planning skills. The gameplay is easy to grasp and completing levels is easy enough to introduce the game to young kids or people new to gaming. However, getting all the gold-level times and achievements should provide a challenge to more seasoned gamers as well.  Steam integration is strong, with trading cards and lots of achievements.",

            "review_text": "If you've played 12 Labours of Hercules, you'll fall right into the rhythm of this one. MOAI: Build Your Dream (first in the series) features the same kind of resource/time juggling, with similarly fluid gameplay and 'cute' graphics, but it's far more strategically challenging. In a good way. It also introduces some classic tower defense levels to mix things up. 12 Labours is an absolute breeze in comparison, since they give ample time to get gold even on Expert.  MOAI makes you  really  think and plan in order to get 3 stars on a level. But even if the timer reaches all the way to zero, you're not penalized for taking as much time as you need. The only thing that takes a hit is your score (and any achievements requiring gold times). There's no 'fail' message or a way to screw up a level unless you waste starting resources. So if you don't care about score or achievements, this is very easy to approach as a slower casual game. If you've just  got  to get 3 stars on every level however, you're gonna have to break out your micromanagement skills.   Getting Gold",

            "review_text": "I was VERY pleasantly surprised with this game. It definitely does have the feel of a mobile game brought to PC/MAC, but that doesn't take away from very relaxed vibes I got playing this game. It's equal parts resource management, timing, strategy, and speed clicker. I thouroughly enjoyed this game after having some herb. The only down side to this game, is that there are a couple of levels where the ammount of clicks neccesary to kill ghosts is quite exessive.  I would still pay for it at full price, but full disclosure I got this game for $1.39.",

            "review_text": "I played and enjoyed the Promised Land. This is similar but this is more time-management heavy. You are against the clock on every level here, whereas in the Promised Land it was pretty laid back and you could progress at your own pace, and just enjoy watching the little town tick over.  I thought I'd not like this when I discovered the ever-present clock, I typically hate time-pressured levels in game. However to my surprise, I really like this...more than the Promised Land! Repeating a level till you get 3 stars (by doing it quickly) is unexpectedly fun and addictive. At first you will simply figure out how to do the level, then you will repeat it, fine tuning your build order every attempt, etc till victory (3 star rating).  The only thing that's a little annoying is the game has a slight arcadey aspect in that some levels include ghosts which attack stuff you build and can destroy it, causing a major setback. You need to zap these ghost with your cursor as they wander about, and they serve as an on-going distraction to your build efforts. I *think* I'd prefer the game did not have those as they add a fair bit of stress to procedings, as if the pressure of the clock was not enough. It certainly makes for a far more edge-of-the-seat game than the Promised Land, as you always feel under pressure and distracted by ghosts. So in that respect, despite several similarities, it has a very different *VIBE* to the first game. The Promised Land is a chill out and watch your beautiful little town expand kind of experience, where this game is one short level after another (each only a screen in size and unrelated to the previous), time attack centric, tests your strategy and reactions, rather hectic puzzle game kind of buzz.   The other main difference is in this game you have no direct control or interaction with your workers. You just click on the thing you want built, collected, fixed or otherwise interacted with (eg one building is a shop and you can trade reasource types at it), and your little guys rush around independently, getting to your queued tasks in in the order you clicked them. In that regard it controls a lot more simply and quickly than the Promised Land, which allows it to stress the player out more and makes for a more exciting game.  I find - unexpectedly - I prefer this game.",

            "review_text": "Really very little story, no real options or choices to make. It's a linear game that tells you what to do. Half the time I didn't even know I had done the last thing and poof I'm off to the next chapter/act/event/whatever.  This is neither a time management nor a building game. Lots of clicking &amp; no thinking. Just click where it tells you to and keep doing that and you win. If you can click you can play. If you get weary of clicking, sigh oh well.  What did I expect? Well the title is Moai: Build Your Dream! so I expected to be able to build stuff. You can &amp; do build stuff, what you are told where you are told and when you are told to, then you can build. Time management, if you don't click fast enough you run out of time, after 2-3 times you know what order to click what to win.  1.4 hours and I'm done. Very happy I got it for $1.67 almost worth it.",

Bugs such as enemies not appearing make certain levels impossible to beat. If only I hadn't sat on it in my backlog for over a year I'd be getting a refund on this one. What a shame.",
