In the next chapter of Magicka, players ascend from the ruins of Aldrheim to experience a Midgård almost wiped free of Wizards after the Wizard Wars, with the few that do remain having either gone mad or extremely hostile toward all...",

            "review_text": "I have seen a lot of people giving negative feedback in reviews about Magicka 2 because they think that the spellcasting system is a worse version of the first game. This is simply not true. There is a distinction between Devs making deliberate balance and gameplay choices and removing features for the sake of removing features. Yes, there are many things that have changed and that have been adopted from Wizard Wars, but in my opinion a lot of these are not worse or better, they just change the way the player plays the game. Going over the comprehensive list of changes I've seen since the first one and why it's still a great game:  - Spellbar nerfed. The elements that used to combine to one in the spell bar don't. This is the most major complaint I've noticed. However, the only thing this affects gameplay-wise is that lightning no longer works in the same spell with steam (intended effect), and lightning no longer works with ice (side-effect and a combo I actually miss). Nor can you cast 5 of steam or ice. This is obviously a balance choice designed to make it so that you cannot give wet status and deal double lightning damage to a target in the same spell cast. It's essentially a general debuff to wizard damage and makes the max amount of button presses per spell always 5.  - Enemies are are buffed. Enemies move at you faster, are more accurate, have clever skills such as trapping you with walls and can swarm you easily. Noticeably enemies that chill you among groups seem to be pretty deadly if you don't remove it fast enough. There is more focus on finding the correct element to blast enemies with as they all have special weaknesses that take them out quickly.   - Magicks nerfed and made easier to cast. There is now a hotkey system for magicks that makes them quick to cast and works on its own cooldown, and you can still manually cast magicks which also has a seperate, short, invisible global cooldown. The two methods can be used simultaneously to cast two magicks in quick succession. There are also a lot less magicks in the game than the first one. Some are still OP (looking at you dragon strike and thunderhead). You also get a little familiar should you so choose that revives you on death in singleplayer/multiplayer which itself can also be revived with the revive magick, giving effectively infinite lives. Push as a standard move (casting without elements conjured) has been changed into a Magick.  - Movement is buffed. You can now move while casting spells; this can be hard to get the hang of at first, but is crucial for being able to kite and fight the now more challenging enemies. You can also heal while on the go. One of the more effective ways I've found to heal now is no longer setting up life mines but instead standard casting a rock element with four life element no charge at your feet for quick powerful heals.   - Weapon Enchants are buffed. Enchantments that include projectile, beam, and shield type spells work similarly as a one time cast, but spray type and lightning type spells now remain on your weapon no matter how many times you swing with it, unless you come into contact with an element of opposite type or have it 'nullified' (more on that in a bit).  - Resistances are reworked. No longer does one resistance level of an element cause complete immunity to it, nor can you give your resistances to others by proximity. It is now on-self and staged in power, requiring more thinking/investment into certain defenses. One resist simply reduces damage. Two removes the harm of status effects, chilled, shocked, burning, frozen, and wet and further reduces damage. Three grants immunity to damage of the type. Four gives you major absorption to the damage type. This means for example should you choose to shield four death, yes you will be able to heal while spamming mines on your opponent, but you will be significantly weaker to physical damage due to not being able to add as much rock or ice armor to yourself.   -Some spell modifiers have slightly less representation. Things such as adding more fire to a fireball, won't cause the radius of the fire explosion after the rock lands to be larger. Similarly AOE attacks won't expand in size. Sprays and lightning retain this ability to grow in range. Other modifiers stay the same, like duration or more damage from adding same type elements.  - Lightning has been reworked. It has increased in spell priority to equal projectile type. Since lightning cannot be used with projectiles rock or ice, there's no info on which is higher. This means that beams no longer carry lightning but lightning instead carries beam element types. It also means that lightning mines are no longer available but instead create a kind of life or death vortex wall. Lightning also causes less stun than before.  - Water knockback nerf. Water element knockback and knockback in general are greatly reduced but still workable. I still use it to keep enemies at bay and for wet status. Mines also don't send you flying nearly as far but some enemy attacks do. This can be frustrating as you can't que spells while in mid-air, something they should change.  - Rock reworked. Charge time greatly extended and distance at low charge reduced. Happens to be a high damage option given that other high damage options are nerfed. AOE Attacks that include rock are particularly powerful since they can be spammed quickly such as water rock death fire (also strong standard cast). Or weapon enchantments like rock death fire x3. Using a single rock in standard cast attacks seems to be best for range and charge.  -Ice has been reworked. Granting yourself ice armor does not cause as much damage with the thorns effect and it also has less damage radius. Ice shards remain powerful. Ice walls and armor now reflect beams, making them much more useful.  - Shields reworked. They now work on a timer that cannot be extended, allow for movement through the barrier, and still protect against beams and sprays, but do not suffice against projectiles which pierce straight through now. The shield dome - shift-middle mouse - now causes a 'nullification' effect, where it removes enchantments from your weapon, prevents you from adding more while inside it, and also removing and preventing the effect of status ailments on you, chilled, burning, wet (big bonus there).  - Crossing life and death beams in Co-op. Now creates a 2000 damage blackhole. Able to be resisted with death resistance and a great cheesy damage technique. Risky without resistance. Life, death, and cold elements also appear to have kept the same qualities from the first game.   On a side note, the campaign feels a little bit shorter than the original, and the humour and references, while still great hadn't tickled me as much this time around. As a plus, the boss battles are all more interesting than before, and enemy type design is more creative. It's a lot easier to hop into a game with friends or complete strangers, and playing through in co-op makes it miles better. If you are a die-hard Magicka 1 fan, and these changes don't sound good to you, stick to Magicka 1. If you're on the fence, get it when it goes on sale. All in all, in my opinion these changes make it a more mobile, defensive, challenging, and strategic game. I have a great deal of fun playing it and look forward to future related projects. Highly recommend it!",

I really like, i find it challenging and fun, but its not a game you will enjoy playing alone that much, and since there are more players in the first magicka, finding someone to play with is hard. Probably gonna try the first one some day, but until now this one is pretty good. Worth the money :)",

But just as I experienced it, the spell system was exhilarating, and exploring more of the seemingly infinite combinations kept the game refreshing. The spell effects are satisfying: if you combine poison and ice, you get poison icicles!  The only criticism that I'd have is for the solo mode. Solo play is smooth for the most part, but it can be a bit frustrating when you're stuck on one particular part of the story. They have made it so that you are pretty much guarenteed to win eventually, but the worst-case scenario is ressing, doing a quick W-A-[space], and then dying again (repeat) without causing much damage at all. It's more noticable when the enemies have health regen, e.g. in the harder difficulties.  Magicka 2 is fun to play with friends. (Sorry Bob, that high-velocity rock to the back of your head was an 'accident'.) The online community is great as well—you might be worried that there'd be trolls all over the place, but most people are reasonable and cooperative.  Recommended.",

I'd recommend disabling the companion as this trivializes a lot of the content, we ended up doing so half-way through the game.  So what is Magicka 2? it's a 1-4 player action spellcasting game with silly jokes and cultural references, you have 8 spells to combine in creative ways, want mines that heal you? combine 'Shield with Life' want to throw a fiery rock? Rock and Fire will do the trick! and so on...  They seem to have simplified the game a little bit, I assume this is because there's now a console version to worry about which might dissapoint a lot of fans of the original game.  So do I recommend giving this a try? yeah, for the asking price it has enough content and fun to get you through it, however I felt that the first game had better story/humor and was lenghtier but at the same time it was a buggy mess, crashed a lot and the netcode was broken.  Give it a go if you have friends to play this with! it makes for a fun weekend of chaos! ;)",

Something about the controls makes it feel off and I can't put my finger on how to fix it. Another major difference is that this is hordes of enemies, all the time. I don't know if the number of enemies scales off of how many peopke you have but with 3 people it was impossible to stay alive for more than a minute. There is lots of the same mini-boss at times, along with constant hordes of enemies. Also there is much less veriety in the weapons available to be picked up, where as in magicka 1 almost every weapon that wasn't bigger than you were was able to be picked up. Overall it has the humor of the original, but not close to the level of gameplay, and that fact is going to couteract the humor, extremely funny as it is.",

Now these are the main points that i hate: -the enemys make the game unbalanced for single player, which brings me to the last point -magic, with lots of reason (if you like wizzard wars magic you are fine but for a magicka player who hated wizzard wars spellcasting) these are the main reason: -the spells with more different element are less powerfull than the simple ones (one element) -you CAN WALK TROUGH SHIELDS, why? -armors are weak, increadibly so -protection auras with multi element are useless, completely -magicks hotkeys are not necessary bad but are completely useless since you can do them with elements without cooldown (for me a least is faster to press 'w+a+space' than '4', and for longer spells is still useless, in magicka the SEDQFS i could cast it five times in 1 second and i got good with training, thats why i got stronger not macros) -cooldowns on magicks without hotkey a second or so (doesn't seem much but it's still annoing) -and there is little other things, but these are the main.  Now the good things. -more magicka story (the story at least feels like a sequel, not the best but good) -the single element aura (ESSSS for example) can absorb the element for healing -graphics  Now the changes that improved the game (that for some reason we had to wait to get): -the priority of lighting over arcane/life has returned (all hail to the lightning beam) -steam and ice are back (but without the lightning water trick, if you know what i mean) -and the new poison element (S+W), it works the same as ice and steam, so we have the 3rd water element -so now we have all the magic back, with more than before (now this is a sequel, with MORE magic than the first)  Still some damage balnce issues but a lot better than before.

I'm gonna make a quick rating about every peice that makes this game into what i think it is:    - Singleplayer Campaign: 9/10  Good. Of course it's impossible to beat without knowing that you can revive your fairy, witch i did not.   - Gameplay 8/10  There was LOTS of changes from Magicka 1 to this one. I'm of with the strafing, it's kinda neat, but one of the things that bug me is that i can't combine steam with lightning, (trust me, that's all i did in the first game) and cooldowns really makes the game annoying,    MAGICKA IS ALL ABOUT SPAMMING, THERE IS NO REASON FOR COOLDOWNS!      - Soundtrack 10/10  I always loved magicka's music, and my opinions about it will never change. The soundtrack is amazing, better than the first one.   - Graphics 9/10  The graphics are nice, they are a lot enhaced, comparing to the first game.   - Humor 11/10  Just like the first game, it's hilarious. Final rating: 9,4/10  For someone who really loves the series this game is great. &lt;3",

The spell system has been reworked for the worse, with far fewer viable spells and only one good AOE spell, you only can do when you have a teammate, which would be OK concept if there were more than 1 of such spells. But the artifact system is great but could have been made more interesting, here I am comparing it with 'The Bastion' which has a much similar system where you pray to 'gods' that grants gold/xp bonuses to you but makes the enemies stronger in some specific way, or you weaker.

Despite the fact that you got the quick cast panel you made combos so simple. Seriously guys FFDFF, QEQE, FFSAA? REALLY??!? DO I HAVE ONE HAND? I GOT BOTH SO ID LIKE TO PRESS SOMETHING LIKE FDFQDF OR QFDWFF. Also the new casting system is cool. So, you dont have to stop while casting. In a nutshell, the game is fun. And its worth 16.99$. I like the magicka universe. And this particular game is a good one. Totally recommended. Dunka Dunka. Thats is all.",

All that things with friends killing, spells learning, 'Not a vampire' jokes and so on made this game some kind of atmospheric for me, made me fall in love with it. And after all, 'Magicka 2' announcment, you scream out loud 'OH GOD, I CAN'T BELIEVE IT', but i can't get one thing, why it was released?   And my first claim is an awful spell control, u know, really awful! Absouluetly.  -Spell while you moving isn't comfortable -'1234' panel is one of the worst thing i've ever seen  -You can't cast a lot of great spells from magicka one  -And the last one. It's bad, just, uhmmm, really bad.   2nd claim. Story. For me that part of the game had never been so important, but it was kind of funny. You could just relax and walk through the adventures, then you could listen to Vlad stories cause he was the big part of the game, now i kinda feeling he isn't. And yup, I'm really disappointed cause of it. Big fat minus again.   And in the end there will be the graphics part. AND I KNOW. Nobody really cares about graphics in magicka, but now i don't like it dunno why. Maybe cause of all these parts in total, maybe cause it doesn't suit for the game.   PROS NOW:   -Now u can open robes and customize your wizzard  -It's still Magicka even if it's not good enough -Nostalgia  I will recommend it cause it's magicka. Well, if you like first part, u, probably, won't mind to play it, even if it's a way worst.   ",

While I'm happy that the AI's difficulty has been upped since the first game, I abhor the spell cooldown system. A huge part of my enjoyment while playing the first magicka was spamming overpowered spells after having memorised each and every one of them. With Magicka 2, you can no longer do that.   Other than that, the game has been really entertaining for me so far, the storyline, humor, even better than the first game. Would probably be more fun once I play this multiplayer.  Edited (After completing campaign on normal difficulty, attempting some trials and challenges on normal and hard difficulties and collecting all magicks):  It seems that the idea of having a cool down for spells is actually for balancing purposes. After getting used to the controls, I feel like normal mode is easy as long as you calmly analyse the enemies' elemental resistance and cast the appropriate elements countering them. It is no doubt more difficult than the first Magicka so take some time to learn the elemental and spell interaction mechanics. Moving around is much more important as shield spells are no longer as strong as they used to be. Ultimately, I think this is actually better than the first Magicka although I still find myself soloing most things since many people will immediately kick you from their game without even letting you show your abilities to work as a team without blowing them up to bits in every battle.   Verdict: Get this game, especially if you have good friends who can play with you. Seriously, like 9/10 rating, for its price this is one of the most enjoyable games I've had in a long time.",

I'll tell you all the truth right now: Today I saw guys who were telling everyone to not buy this game because it's bad but actually they've played this game only for couple of minutes and were stuck on chapter 1 at normal difficulty level cause they were terrible noobs and I assume you that most of all the negative reviews are written by noobs like these.  Either they are stuck on chapter 1 because their hands grow from their backs or they've decided to jump on a 'bandwagon of hate'. Some of those noobs who've played the game only for 20 minutes even dare to say that the game has only 4 magicks...  So, don't be tricked by those reviews and even if some will say that people who give positive reviews are just 'fanboys who defend game developers' don't believe them cause I'm not trying to 'white-knight' anybody here.  I'm just telling truth and if that's not enough for you to believe that me or someone else whose opinion is similar to mine is telling truth about this game just check my or their profiles and you'll see that they've played it for more time than any of those haters did. ---------------------------------------------------------- Now some review about the game itself: Most of the people are complaining about removal of overpowered magicks. What they actually want to say is that 'it's bad to kill enemies using tactics, thinking, escaping, defending' and they'd rather just use some overpowered magicks on enemies for it to be '1 second job'.  Judge for yourself what's better but as I think it's better to have real fun thinking than just watching enemies die in a seconds.  People say 'those hotkeys were made for stupid PS users'. Those hotkeys got recharge time and that's what people are mostly complaining about. Actually those recharges can be easily bypassed if you'll activate magicks manually.  Example: Pressing 3 to use thunderhead will take 3 seconds to recharge with basic set. But if you'll do FFSAA this'll make it activate right after it was fully conjured so everytime you use thunderhead with FFSAA you can just do FFSAA again and there'll be no recharge time and still you'll get that magick activated.  People say 'game is non-beatable on bananas alone'. Actually I completed game on bananas alone and even if that's hard it's still manageable because familiars that revive you can be revived too, if you'll not run like mad but watch your step and try to deal with enemy groups one by one you'll get your success.  Only thing that I don't like about this game is that it doesn't have much of a content. Sure there'll be more downloadable content and updates later but for now it's not much.",

It's an unique, adventure game that is a lot of fun with friends and the devs increased the replay value a little by adding multiple levels of difficulty to the   adventure   this time.  But I have to be honest on my feelings towards this sequel that I was looking forward to for quite some time. At the time of writing this review I have about 20hrs in game and almost 700 hrs in the prequel. I was clearly an avid Magicka player but I felt this sequel fell short of what made the original game 'magical' (pun intended).   Lets start with the spell casting. I miss the freedom and creativity of casting a multitude of varying spells at will to defeat my surrounding enemies in the prequel. Where as in the sequel I feel limited, weaker and as if I'm spamming the same spells because not much else works. Also the Magicks are no where near as impressive as in the original.  The challenge mode is another example of 'better in the prequel' and the missing VS mode is a disappointment and if Magicka: Wizard Wars is supposed to fill that void then... no thanks. I already had my fill on the sequel and not sure how much more time I'll spend on it.   I understand that this game was developed for the PS4 as well. Not sure if the changes were to make the game more controller friendly or if the devs wanted to manipulate how players played their game. In comparison this Magicka has lost it's touch.  ----Bottom Line----  Magicka 2 is a cool little game on it's own. But with it's prequel standing behind, it's easily overshadowed. Some may agree that Magicka 2 would make more sense as the prequel and the original it's sequel.   If you never played any Magicka game before I recommend this one because the online presence in the first game is almost non existent at this point.",

            "review_text": "I got this game expecting it to be terrible, but I was pleasantly surprised.  One of the things that worried me the most was that they were changing the magick system; I thought that because magicks are so critical to gameplay, having a cooldown or being limited in the number of magicks would change everything too much, but you actually have all magicks available at once, the hotbar is only there to aid in quickcasting certain things, this way you can cast resurrection while wet etc. Secondly, the cooldown is actually very low, especially if you do the magick the old fashioned way. The hotbar cooldowns are independent of the normal input cooldown, so you can use the two in tandem to let off magicks really quickly. I understand how the cooldowns can be seen as a pain in the ♥♥♥, but keep in mind that you get very powerful magicks from the start, so if you could spam like you could in Magicka 1, the game would be too easy.  Another thing that can be upsetting is the fact that steam and ice are not separate elements anymore, but this is honestly for the better, as the old steam-and-lightning-ray from the original Magicka made the game way too easy. In Magicka 2 you actually have to be adaptive in how you play and use different spells to take down different enemies.  As a result, the game is much harder than the first, but I think this is honestly a good thing. They send more varied enemies at you so you have to selectively shield yourself from different elements and you absolutely have to make use of your ability to walk an cast at the same time in order to survive.  The new system of robes and staves is also good because there aren't any overpowered robes like the cyber robe from the first game.  I actually think that despite some of my favorite things being missing, this game is actually better than the first one. The tagline 'Learn to Spell, Again' is very accurate, as this game plays completely different from the first. One of my only complaints with the game is the number of meme jokes they put in the game. They retained their good comedy from the first one, but they added way too many pop-culture references in between.",

            "review_text": "As someone who's played dozens of hours of the first Magicka game without really delving into Wizard Wars before playing this, I actually recommend Magicka 2 overall.  Spiritually, I find it to be much the same as the original magicka, even if at times the puns and things seemed to be laid a little thick. But then I realize that some players might not be as thorough as I trying to find all the fun stuff that magicka throws in there for us. I LOVED the feeling of going through the world and going 'OH! This is where this happened in the first game!' It really made the game world feel like a static, solid thing and not just a backdrop for all the magical foolery this game is known for. Some of the secrets I've found in this game were really clever and some of them, honestly, I never would have found if it weren't for a misfired spell or six. I also loved some of the puzzles, and really hope they make some kinda puzzle map or something later down the road.  But when it actually comes to the gameplay, as someone who wasn't familiar at all with Wizard Wars there was definitely a learning curve involved trying to 'learn to spell again'. The changes to steam and ice most notably screwed me up until I found spells and a playstyle that suited me. Pairing steam/ice with lightning is no longer a thing, but I think that in light of the other changes in the game it's actually a good thing to not have 'one-hit wonder' type spells that are entirely self-sufficient. It's no longer a case of one-shot or get one-shot type combat, in most circumstances you'll have reaction time to save yourself and adapt to your circumstances. A few of the controls changed, which made it hard for me to rely on my muscle memory from Magicka, but it wasn't anything a bit of practice couldn't fix. Selfies were involved. But I hear they're going to allow remappable keys in the near future which is great, even if it's not a big deal for me personally.  Defensive magic and movement recieved a huge overhaul in Magicka 2 from Magicka and, imo, the sooner you master how to cast while moving the better off you'll be, as spells no longer encumber you NEAR as much as they used to, it's barely noticeable in normal play. But with the changes to solid-based defense spells (ice/stone walls and armors) you'll find that these spells more situational by comparison than in the first Magicka, given that they now have a duration based on magnitude and no longer protect you as completely as they used to. For non-solid based defense spells (fire, lightning, cold, etc.) they made them into scaling resistance based on magnitude that scales from resistance to immunity to full on absorption. These wards, as they're called in game, are an excellent reason why I think the changes to steam/ice are a good thing, because in a co-op setting it makes people choose from fewer elements (less slots, opposites) which makes it easier to defend against or even benefit from friendly fire, arguably one of the most frustrating aspects in the old game because the spells were so powerful you usually got instantly killed from multi-element assault.  Further, when it comes to personalization and choice within the game, I think the changes to the robe/weapon choices were monumental. When I played co-op I HATED finally finding the tesla staff in the campaign, dying and being almost guaranteed to lose it forever because combat would blow everything everywhere/cliffs involved. But now, you find something in the world and you unlock it permanently to be used whenever you want in something of a loadout system that can be accessed from the main menu of the game, so that if you die you spawn with it in hand, ready to rock. ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. But more over is that these choices of wardrobe actually have a huge impact on your playstyle, much more so than before, imo. They grant great power, but limit your ability to perform with other elements, which I think is a thoughtful twist that I personally like. It makes me problem solve on the fly and see how far I can take one or two main elements.  The only thing that's gotten me any kind of irritation is the somewhat buggy co-op. It's not often, but there are times when I get randomly dropped from a game with my friend sitting a room over from me while we're in menu setting up a game. I'm not sure what the root cause is, but it's not happened when we're actually in-game, thankfully. I'm not sure what the deal is with unlocks either, as some of them, no matter how many times we brought an item with us to the end of a level, just wouldn't unlock, so I presume they're barred by difficulty? In the event they're not, though, I find it highly irritating.  I also found the story, while interesting, to be somewhat shorter than what I had anticipated. Maybe it just felt shorter because I tore into it like a kid at Christmas, but it felt like...it was missing an element of epicness that the first one had somehow. Most of the time in the story I was just going 'WTF vlad', because some of the things he did (no spoilers) simply didn't make sense to me. I hope they'll do another 'other side of the coin' type deal to expand on that.  All in all I know this game will keep me busy for a while and I recommend it to anyone willing to give it a try.",

            "review_text": "I finished yesterday the adventure on banana difficulty, here are a few observation : 1- With the right staff, the game is a breeze (except for the constant one shot kill) 2- Robes' effects are negligible, too many things murders you instantly (goblin bombers, trolls) 3- Armors are even more important, a good armor in the right situation can save you lots of problems. 4- I haven't found any way to stop the green type of damage (even life absorb did nothing) Also, if you can't finish the game on solo in hard difficulty or even normal and complain that it is too hard, then I am sorry to tell you, but LEARN TO SPELL...   As far as solo goes, you can swap robe quickly at each checkpoints (simply reach a checkpoint, quit, change your equips, then go back to adventure).   If you are in a group, you only need one strong arcane user and one strong ice user to wreck the content. Arcane is strong against any living creature, so far, there is no real use of undead creatures, so arcane is strong against anyone except for fire mobs (somehow resists arcane ?). Since fire mobs are weak to ice, then just have a strong ice user. A healer might be a good idea, since many staves reduce life magic. Life + Arcane cross beam is useful too.  All in all, the game is not difficult if you know how it works, you MUST move while casting. The keybinding just came up, a bit rudimentary, but I can live with it for now.  Lastly, I found a single irritating bug, which is a problem with the Y axis (a beam going through an enemy because some derping on the Y axis), but if you using an AoE instead of a beam or a projectile, you'll be fine.",

I played through all of the Sneak Peak on the highest difficulty (Banana), got all the unlockables (so far), and I cannot wait for more. 'Killing your friends? You’re doing it right!' was the moto for the first game, this one is much more 'team-based' for the harder modes (which isn’t a bad thing!) It allows you to enjoy your first time around just doing whatever, whether it be killing your friends, to healing or helping the minions and then killing your friends.. The next few times through (I’ve found) that you look for the unlockables... then kill your friends. And as you increase the difficulty it becomes more and more team based and you actually need to think about the correct answer to solving a puzzle. The first Magicka game set the bar high for the ones to come (MWW and this) and so far I’m liking M2 so much it’s going to break my rating scale... But, this game did have 2 down sides when playing it... The first on being, at Banana Mode you need to work WITH friends (and if you've caught on you'll know I don’t have the best of times doing that) the second being that the replayability factor is a little low for me... After beating it on each difficulty and unlocking all the unlocks, and even beating challenge mode with friends its really only replayable if you haven’t beat it... (Ignoring than that singular factor I’d give this game 9001/10 but seeing how much it really means to have that replayability (and believe me the comedic part of the game almost won me over and looked past the replayability..) I’m going to rate it at 9/10 because of the replayability, but there is so much good comedy and features I almost want to look past the replayability.. Really... But hey, that’s just my theory, a GAME... oh wait.. If you get the game than Im sure you'll love it!",

            "review_text": "Magicka 2 FIRST IMPRESSIONS   Magicka, I would say, was the most unique and creative top-down RPG/ARPG/Mage-Type game I have seen released, and in my opinion, nothing really came close ever since then. Sure, FORCED and Gauntlet was fun, but they did not really have a very high skill cap, and not much in way of PvP. There were no cooldown to spells, and how strong your mage can be is 100% determined by skill and practice, with more experienced players being able to call upon a greater arsenal of spells, and casting stronger spells and combos much more efficiently. However, the game itself was really buggy, with game breaking glitches happening more often then not. Still, the concept was brilliant, and I was really hoping to see more of it.  Magicka: Wizard Wars, took everything Magicka had, and kind of 'dumbed' it down, into a much easier to play and master package. Granted that the new 'press one button for ultimate' and 3 spell system did in fact improve PvP, as players would now spend more time killing each other than screwing up ultimate spells, but I would say I still prefer the original, although it is a great game in its own right, and free-to-play too.  Finally, Magicka 2, a continuation of the story after Wizard Wars. Long story short, I felt that Paradox tried too hard to make controller happen. Even while playing on the PC, it tells me at every turn to 'Press A/Space to continue'. I mean, probably like 3% of people who play on PC uses a controller? Furthermore, it felt like a 'noob' friendly version of the original Magicka. Having 4 spells on quickcast is great, but having it makes the game feel so... empty. The point of Magicka was being able to cast powerful spells in clutch situations, where I can do that now with 1 key press. The removal of some elements (i.e steam, ice) is also a pretty big blow to the game. No more can I cast my favourite Steam+Lightning when I'm panicking. Finally, the removal of default 'Push' ability, turning it into a spell. Maybe I'm not used to it yet, but I don't like it.  TL;DR  Pros: +Smoother gameplay, won't screw up element order due to lag +Secrets to find, stories to tell +Faster game pace V.S Magicka +Addition of new spells/changing how some elements interact with others +Addition of quickcast (easier for beginners) +Can walk while casting spells +5s V.S 5min loading screens  Cons: -Removed fusing of elements (i.e fire+water=steam) -Easy mode with 4 quickcast spells (defeats true purpose of magicka) -Trying too hard to make controller happen on an obviously PC game -Changed concept of 'Push', hard to adapt to it for old players -No more 'recipe' for spells with the mouse wheel below your hero -Cannot chain spells, there is a slight cooldown period (~0.5s-1s) between 2 spells -No option to rebind keys and sudden change of keys from original game maeks confusion -Cannot emergency teleport as you're falling off a cliff to save yourself -Screen doesn't center on your character (pretty game breaking) ---------CAN'T CLICK TO CONTINUE PLEASE I BOUGHT THE PC VERSION I WANT TO CLICK TO CONTINUE I DONT WANNA PRESS A -Freaking loading screen suggested I throw a rock on myself (LOL)  Suggestions: Adding a 'hardcore mode', where the 4 quickcast slots are disabled, AND you walk exponentially slower for each element you have prepared Make spell spamming/chaining a thing again Bring back fusion of elements An option to switch walking back to holding down the mouse button only instead of both clicking and holding working together.  Overall, I would give it a 7.5/10, very much worth playing, but has potential to be soooo much better, for $15, I would definitely recommend getting this game. HOWEVER, getting Magicka (the original) first would be better, I can see Magicka players transitioning into Magicka 2, but not the other way around.   P.S, I've only gone 1 hour into the game + sneak peak so far, sooooooo some things above may or may not be accurate, I honestly have no idea if you get to fuse elements later on into the game or not, but like I said, first impressions review. Will update when have more hours.  P.P.S Cast EFFFF on yourself then spamming FFDFF Space pretty much owns every level",

            "review_text": "Magicka 2 is Magicka, too. Have all the fun blowing up your enemies, and having your partners die in collateral.  Mechanics - Large number of mechanics brought over from Wizard Wars. You can move while casting (ALL casting now), Steam/Ice is a seperate fire/water/frost element element, bombs remain when you do stone/shield/anything.  They also kept the Magick hotkeys from Wizard Wars. You can assign things like Revive/Haste to hotkeys now, which trigger a short CD on the hotkey. Magicks can ALSO be casted manually, but hotkeys ignore various incompatilities (For instance, you can use Haste/Revive while wet with Hotkeys).  Controls are a bit different. Melee/imbue is now shift-right. They seem to have removed the ability to cast wind baseline. AoE is shift-middle mouse button. One of the ONLY annoying things I've seen in Magicka 2, since casting AoE is now a bit more tricky, and I can't count how many times I've killed myself with that.  Wards have 4 stages. 1 element provides bout 33% damage reduction to that element. 2 elements provide 50%, and immunity to any side effects (Wet/Burning/Frozen). 3 elements provide full protection, and 4 elements provide absorption. In addition, rock armor no longer prevents one from being knocked back. Strangely enough, it seems that COLD ward provides knockback immunity from what I've noticed.  Finally, damage has been, more or less, reduced compared to Magicka 2. Remember those ice balls that one-shotted bosses, full powered stones that plowed through all the enemies, and the usage of Ice AoE/Steam to quickly slaughter all the small fry? Thats gone now. A full rock still does quite a bit of damage, but it's not going to oneshot anything bigger then a goblin. Ice, when combined with rock, deals LESS damage then a pure rock, its just that Ice shatters preventing the risk of a ricochet killing you (Rocks now have a tendency to bounce back at you if it doesn't kill the mob, and even when it does, be prepared to get pwned by your own boulder). Steam's main purpose now is to wet targets while dealing slight damage.  It also takes a bit longer to fully charge Rock/Ice, about 2-3 seconds longer. Good news is that Ice does a significantly larger amount of damage, and is very useful in close quarters combat. Killing enemies quickly is now about figuring out their weakness, rather then launching overpowered balls of doom or beams of zapping steam to slaughter everything in your way.  Also, in each game, you have a familiar. You have the basic fairy (Who DOESN'T annoy you anymore!), as well as two additional familiars that provide a dps boost (There may be more added in the future). New thing - You can REVIVE your fairy! This means that you should, more or less, never wipe.   Content - Magicka 2 uses a new gearing system, where you select your robe, your staff, your weapon, and your color at the main menu. If you find a staff, and generally if you acquire a weapon, it'll be added to your collection for you to use whenever you please. Magicks are also added to your collection to keep across the Adventure mode. Finally, theres a new thing called Artifacts, which allow you to further customize your games, with options such as weaking/buffing/removing a system of magic, greatly strengthing/weakening yourself/your enemies, and even fun options, such as causing background laughter whenever someone dies.   There are also two modes - Adventure, and Challenge. Challenge is just like in Magicka, you fight a number of predetermined waves of enemies. In Adventure mode, you have the main chapters, as well as small mini-challenges attached to each chapter. Like Magicka, there is no baseline Versus mode in the game.   For those interested in the amount of content of the main adventure, currently it seems as though the Adventure mode in Magicka 2 is about 3-4 hours shorter then that of Magicka.  TL:DR - Magicka 2 is Magicka, too!",

If you haven't played Magicka 2 yet however and you are wondering whether to buy it then i would say go buy the first one instead if you haven't already.   So far my experience with this game was 20 minutes of trying to get the compulsory Paradox account setup which doesn't connect to the servers half the time. Then after that I ran the tutorial in a similar fashion to the Magicka 1 tutorial, no problems so far except the controls being changed slightly.  However, when I started fighting enemies it was so boring and the spells are almost useless as well as using magicks. The goblins are not too bad but the crabs you fight for the first hour of the game can freeze you and one of the big crab enemies is immune to EVERYTHING from the front. I had to invite a friend just so I could get behind it to kill it and then to my surprise they don't send anything but more of these crabs and a crab which fires poison at you for the next hour after that point.   Now you may just say I'm bad at the game but Magicka 1 never annoyed me like that and it never felt like a pain in the ♥♥♥ to kill something. Whats the point in being given access to all these spells etc when half the enemies you meet are immune to them. For most enemies so far all me and my friend have done is just use Fire as its stupidly OP against anything that isn't resistant to it. While Earth and Ice are completley useless, they do below 1000 damage fully charged while fire gets to that damage with it spell (while casting) in seconds. I will probably update this review if I find anything new to consider.  Sorry for that rant there.  TL:DR Basically the game just isn't balanced well and the enemies are pretty unfair for the player to fight as most spells are ineffective, especially as this is a mere hour into the game (that I've reached).   If I find anything else worth mentioning in the future i'll update this review. Thanks for reading :)",

First magicka was like a shy, clunky but funny wizard, who isn't takes himself too serious. By the times of the sequel he bought a red nose, bright stupid robe and megaphone and roams the streets, screaming 'LOOK I'MA CLUMSY WIZARD! LAUGH!' Point: Most of jokes there have no point.  Okay, maybe this one isn't correct, and first game was just as screaming 'I'M FUNNY', and it's my nostalgic-o-filter removed any bad memories. Soo, this part will be in the final score, but have no influence on it.   Magic system changes...  Huge nerf hit the best steam-shock-arcane and ice-earth combos. R.I.P. my only usable lategame/DLC spells. Basic wind attack are magicka now. Also, cooldowns for everything. EVERYTHING. They put a high priority in nerfs. Are we playing serious PvE MOBA now? ..wait, aren't those two terms mutually exclusive?.. Point: Unnecessary, even stupid changes.   Difficulty...   I was unable to pass trough a some point where you should spin a water wheel. Why? I was alone. Enemies keep spawning endlessly, and water wheel needs to be constantly showered for... For at least 15 seconds, I guess. More than enough for crabs to butcher a player. Point: Simply unplayable at singleplayer. Like at all.  Looks like that part with water wheel got changed a bit, with flow of crabs replaced by a few scripted bunches. That point will be rewritten after I make it to the end. Still, no one of my friends wants to buy it now.    Interface and controls...   My god.  Warning: lots of bunnies ahead. First. What the bunny is this? Hotbar? It's just... Wrong. Magicka is a game about pure button mashing, with disadvantage of high error chance being an important part of the first game. It's like for a fighting game devs to include hotkeys for instant combo attacks. Second. What the bunny is wrong with this camera? At the moment battle beguns it moves to the monsters, basically instantly cornering player with enemies all over the screen. That's bunny beautiful. Third. What is this, strafing? Okay, where is my covers, regeneration, machinegun and first-person view? Games where attack (shot) happens when you press mouse button may need strafing.  Games where attack (boulder throw) happens after you release mouse button should NOT have strafing. It's bunny annoying to aim. Fourth. Loading screens. Menus. Tips. Ahem. Are you... Wait a second. Ahem. ARE YOU   BUNNY KIDDING ME?! IF DEVELOPERS ARE TO BUNNY LAZY TO SIT TEN MINUTES IN A BUNNY IMAGE EDITOR AND MAKE A TWO BUNNY SEPARATE 'Press X to continue' IMAGES FOR PC AND CONSOLE, THEY SHOULD ALREADY CONSIDER FINDING A NEW BUNNY JOB. Mostly because such laziness shows how much they care about what are they doing. It's literally twenty minutes of work at worst, and it pokes in the eyes of every player from every bunny loading screen! Okay, maybe it was due to some technical limitations. Then I'm sorry. BUT IT ISN'T BUNNY 80s, AND WE AREN'T PLAYING 8-bit CONSOLE GAMES  , ARE WE? Point: Embarrassing. Ugly status effects. Annoying strafing. And I don't want to know what button I should press on gamepad my PC don't have.   Graphics...  Okay, spells looks cooler than in first game. But they are just taken from Magicka: WW, aren't they? Point: Better than in first game, same as in MWW. Nothing looks improved.

Magicka 2 has very few in comparison, especially if you include all of their respective DLCs. As of right now, Magicka is much more worth it than this one, especially with the huge discounts. Now, I wouldn't write a review if I didn't play this game more. I have it on my PS4, and even if the controller brings a different experience in terms of control, the general feel is still there. By no means am I saying 'Hey, don't get this game because it's terrible.' It isn't, it's pretty alright.   Now, to bring up few things that I felt were a bit jarring at first; The adjustments to shield channeling. As well as the poison element. I can get both of them, and they're both great! It's just that I tended to use water arcane attacks while a friend would use cold or lightning-based ones, which would result in a rather horrifying combo.

On top it's also by an entirely different development studio than the first, and by the third (fourth if you count the mobile game) studio to work on the series. Therefore it obviously plays differently in many ways past the basic concept, compared to any previous iteration in the series.  However, one thing it has done the same so far as the first game, is the rocky start, seemingly completely void of any practical thought or testing put into some parts during development.  For example, when you start the game for the first time, it starts in 1280x720, and puts you right into the prologue/tutorial chapter. Wouldn't be a big issue, if the options menu wasn't only available from the main menu of the game. Supposedly (can't confirm as I did the prologue as it was), exiting the game into main menu before completing the tutorial also locks you out of the main game, and requires editing config files or reinstalling the game, to have the game run for the 'first time' again. On launch the game was also missing all forms of control settings. As of right now it's only added in the form of including keybindings in the config file to edit. The hastily written guide on how to edit it is missing a lot of details, and has some info plain wrong.  Magicka 2 keeps in various balance changes and limitations made for the PvP spin-off Wizard Wars, which were sensible for a PvP-only game, but hardly so for a regular PvE game. Especially in a series where the draw came from the freedom of doing anything and everything exactly as fast and accurately as you could hit your keyboard keys. There's  a post in the community discussions  which explains a lot better than I can, how the game was simplified and rebalanced compared to 1  The newly introduced cooldown system makes the selection of various staves you acquire during the game rather useless. In chapter 2 you find the Jester staff, which majorly reduces magick cooldowns. Additionally it increases the effectiveness of the shield element, used for both crucial survivability as shields and resistances, and damage, in the form of mines and elemental walls.  The game is very much designed around multiplayer, and when playing solo, not only will it be brutal at parts, you will straight up miss on content, as there are some secrets that require multiple people to open. Fortunately the game does seem to point these out when found, so you don't waste your time trying for too long.  In all, it takes getting used to, if coming from the first game, but  it's not unplayable . However right now I'd still recommend waiting for the upcoming patches being put out based on community feedback. Then look again.",

The first Magicka was probably my favourite co-op game, the art style was fun, the spells were awesome, and the overall design of the levels felt really good with a mix of rpg style dungeon locations, to lakes and forest. But i'm here to talk about Magicka 2.  The game feels backwards instead of something brand new, almost like the original magicka would be more fitting as the sequel, sure not because of story, but for little experience things and obvious mechanics that were present in the first game, but missing in the second game is why people get frustrated by this game.  Firstly, you cant change controls and are locked to their default, which might not be the best for you, i am left handed so it is quite awkward to use the default control scheme, the problem with this, is that you were able to change controls in the original magicka game no problem, and in wizard wars, so it's a bit strange that they didn't include this for the sequel, in 2015. It is really strange and makes no sense, they then later responded by adding a config, but the config text document, doesnt allow you to use all keyboard controls to change, but only a specific amount. A huge turn-off, the magick system is different, and seems to follow some of the rules to wizard wars, but with the same 5 elements, i don't like this, why not build upon the first games system, with the unique spells you could use to keep things just like magicka, and leave the other systems for the different games, it feels like a downgrade, some of elements on screen are placed quite strangely too.  The actual game though is ok, i'm not going to say its fun, but its not, not enjoyable atleast, and i'm sure with the DLC they can improve and make this game twice as good.   Pros   Co-op is good Challenges are challenging Good art style   Cons   No customising controls Spellcasting system is not good Wards are weak Floaty gameplay UI elements placing Story  The game is ok, it's not worth the full price though 7.99 like magicka 1 is ok rather than 10.99 the developers must have been really lazy, but it can always improve with updates and DLC, thats actually worth it, and not just the same broken game for more cash.

They've also made the game much harder - which isn't necesarily a bad thing, but the way they've done it just encourages ragequiting. Sheild spells and elemnet immunities are almost entierly removed from the game, and most enemies now 1-shot a player. This makes single player very difficult, and makes multiplayer far less strategic. There used to be multiple team members casting diffiernt buffs and healing. Now you just choose who's the distraction to run at the enemy, die, and get revived while a few friends hang back and shoot things.  Pros: Music is great, as it was in the first game. Writting is on point too. Classic magicka humor will have you cracking up.  Overall, it feels like a beta test of the first Magicka before they realized what good gameplay was and how awesome a truly dynamic spell system is and decided to add those. Except it's 4 years after the original... Is this what passes for a sequel these days?  3/10 Might be worth 1-2 dollars on a steam sale some day.

As a result you feel weak in comparison to the first Magicka.   I also do not like the new spell formula. I can understand why some people would like to cast spells with fewer amount of button clicks. I rely liked the old way. The most powerful spells demanded up to 10 clicks. With the new system you can’t cast spell with more than 5 basic elements. Fire and water do not become steam in one slot. It is the same with water and ice.   A minor problem for me is that the game seems to have been made with consoles in mind. The new spell casting system would fit controllers better than mouse and keyboard.

The movement controlled are all f---ed up. Instead of clicking in a dirrection and having your character move there and then when you stop clicking your character stops moving, you click an area on the screen and your character moves there with no easy way of stopping him even if the area you clicked is a giant pillar of flames on a river. You'll go right through it. IT'S LIKE YOU'RE WALKING ON ICE ALL THE TIME. that there is enough for you not to get this game if you like Magicka. Honestly, you're better off just playing magicka 1 again. Don't even try this bag of sh--.",

            "review_text": "What happens on the screen mostly is something unspeakably awful: there is too much hardcore here, physics fails much compared to the first magicka. Some people whines devs casualed the game, but in my opinion they made it too hard to play - I was used to constantly use magickas before, such as lighting or teleport, now with automagickas ('press 4 for ressurect') I have to wait lot of seconds before using it again.  Really, it's hard even on normal difficulty. Amount of enemies is too high, I can't even see my character, not to mention magicks I cast. What are they trying to accomplish here, compete with starcraft 2? On 9th level I still haven't lighting strike, pfft.   One thing that is really improved - multiplayer system. Finally I can join anyone's game during the process, host can kick abusers / intruders, but otherwise game is a fail. Srsly, it's unplayable, if only magicka1 had the same multiplayer system I'd returned there and forgot about sequel as a nightmare.  То, что творится на экране - это какой-то абзац. Врагов очень много, дохнут они долго даже на минимальной сложности, магик мало, из-за 'оказуаливания' между ними теперь долгий перерыв. К примеру, в первой магике я мог кастануть с десяток молний подряд, в пвп получались офигенные окмбо, т. к. я выучил комбинации для кучи полезных магий. Классический пример с 9 уровня: узкий участок карты на который со всех сторон лезут бесконечные противники, учитывая, что каждый выпиливается несколько секунд, а массовых магий нет, выпиливать эти толпы сплошное 'удовольствие'. Приходится ждать пол минуты для респавна, полминуты карл! Магика онлайн не пошла на пользу серии. Единственное, что радует - это мультиплеер, вот его бы в первую магику запихнуть и вторую можно выкидывать.",

            "review_text": "This game is only slightly like the original. I can see they tried to make is more 'challenging', but in reality the only thing that makes is challenging is the lack of freedom the player has with the abilities themselves. Placing timers between casting the same spell, weakening shields so you're constantly spamming them just to stay alive, taking more damage from your own abilities, and making it so that elemental immunity requires 4 of one element+shield (Which effectively means you better pick one and take physical plus other elemental damage, or choose your poorly protective simple shield... in which you still take a considerable amount of health damage). In reality; the first game was fun because it was humorous, and had a sense of power for the player wherein you could spam spells as fast as your fingers could type them, and the enemies kept coming with different attributes, forcing creativity with a very intuitive and genius system. Taking away power from the player does not create a challenge, it creates frustration. I was very disappointed in this version of the game, and if I could I would ask for my money back. I plan to simply play expansions for the first one until I am done with them.",
