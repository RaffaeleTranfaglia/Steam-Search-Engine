            "review_text": "This is a spoiler-free review. A Date in the Park is a free point and click adventure title with hints of horror and mystery. You control a man named Lou, who has recently moved to Lisbon, Portugal from London, England. Being in the country for just a matter of days, Lou met Catarina, a woman that he really connected with, in a bar and agreed to meet her at her favorite park.  When it comes down to gameplay and mechanics, there's nothing that sets this title apart from the rest of the retro point and click crowd. It's everything that you would expect it to be. However, the 90's digitized photo graphics are a nice touch, and bring an overall nostalgic feel to the game. You will wander around the park in search of Catarina, while solving simple puzzles and enjoying the off-beat atmosphere that is abound.  So if the game is simple, and not really all that groundbreaking, why am I recommending it? Well, I can't tell you... that's the mystery. You truly need to find out for yourself. The heart of A Date in the Park lies within its unexpected twists and unsettling vibe. The game also does a good job at making you feel lost and helpless, since all of the people that you interact with reply in Portuguese while Lou only knows English; of course this effect isn't the same if you actually do know Portuguese. The game is free, and it only lasts 30 minutes, so you've really got nothing to lose but half an hour if you don't enjoy yourself. However, I can't foresee that happening. Go ahead and give A Date in the Park a shot, and enjoy the enigma within.   Rating:  3.0/5.0  - Average, can take it or leave it.",

            "review_text": "This was...an interesting game to say at least. The lack of a soundtrack and just nature sounds makes it hauntingly eerie. The gameplay isn't too hard to follow and the mapping isn't too complicated but just enough to forget where you are times out of panic. Now for the story, (blocking in case of spoilers)    The plot overall had a LOT of potential, and I know this was a short game, but I kind of wish they went more into how's and why's. I dunno, unless they intend to make a 2nd, I really don't like being left with answers. But despite all of this I do like that it was in a strange scenario where you can't ask for help. That did save it from the lack of er...plot.    I would probably recommend this game to any of my friends who are starting off with odd creepy games to test the waters. As for experienced horror/creepy fans like myself, well it is a good way to kill some time.",

A slow-pacing game with a tiny bit of creepy atmosphere which keeps you wondering if something will be happening at all, at that so-calm desolated place.  It might be lacking a bit of background story, but in my opinion the amount of content is just right as it is.  I had to come back to the same points a couple of times, nevertheless, counting the duration of the game, didn't find myself getting bored at all.",

When you try to stick a door key inside a window, it doesn't just give you an ordinary 'no point' message, but it says, 'There is no keyhole in this window'. Also, it gives you a lot to explore and really gets you immersed for a couple of hours. However, I am a bit confused with the final plot twist, I think it would be better if there were multiple endings (and some explanation wouldn't do any harm). This could make a great thriller/psycholgical horror game had it been longer and choise-based. They say the whole story has something to do with the Greek mythology that is referred to several times through the game. I have yet to look that up.",

I did like the dissonance of me being able to figure out what the Portuguese said while the Protagonist was completely in the dark.
