            "review_text": "Six Sides of the World is simple in design yet complexly brilliant as the stakes always change in small ways. The game introduces a surprisingly large variation of challenges that never become too complex to frustrate, nor do they ever get dull or stale. As you progress, new features are added, modified, and the scale grows, multiplying the amount of planets to explore while the style and shape of these tiny worlds also change.   The game certainly keeps things fresh for a long duration and does a good job at bringing in new elements to further the challenge. The only thing to note is that the game can be a slight pain when levels become bigger. Yet there are factors to help with this, such as color coordinated portals, and being able to freely rotate the screen around the planet you’re on helps to reduce confusion.   The game can be a rather enjoyable experience whether you’re playing for few minutes or over an hour or two.",
