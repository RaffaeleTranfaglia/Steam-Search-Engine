            "review_text": "This game has a lot of good qualities, but many of them are nullified by the utter crap that is the AI and lack of diversity in gameplay.  Many of you will enjoy the feel of commanding your own tank force, as well as knowing that your air force are fighting furiously in the skies above you, and I good thing to notice is that the skybox literally looks almost like real sky.  However, know that every main gun you get behaves the exact same way, such as my 20mm Kwk having the exact same effect as a 75mm Kwk. Every shell also appears to be HE, which is something that drives me away from liking the tank combat.  From what I can tell, the part of your tank that a shell hits has an effect on how much damage you take. However, many times the AI tanks will charge you, then immidiatly turn around, exposing their engine (which is a 1-shot kill) and running away.  It's worth noting that in-game models seem to be made with care, as I was quickly able to distinguish a ZiS gun from a PaK gun. You can also see the differences between infantry models, as well as the weapons they carry. The tank models, however, look made in a 640x400 resolution. Seeing as how the game can run in 1366x768, they just plain look ugly.  The missions aren't very diverse. It's always a mix of 'kill everything that moves,' 'go here,' and 'don't die.' Thus the game gets boring very quickly. The few siege missions are set up very, very poorly. They allow you to camp around your repair and ammo supplies and kill the oncoming enemies as quickly or slowly as your little heart desires.  Overall, this isn't necessarily a  bad  game, but it's most certainly not a good one either.",

Also, the tracks don't work - the tanks just glide over the landscape! I knew it for the reviews and tought I could get over it but I just can't lol. BTW I am a huge tank fan (played Panzer Commander and playing World of Tanks...).",
