            "review_text": "Well, let's start with the good.  -As you can probably see from the screenshots, the game looks nice.  -Fairly large, open universe.  -The filler parts of the game are well designed and somewhat enjoyable.   -It runs at a solid 60FPS  -The voice acting is ok.  Now for the bad:  -The campaign is really short. I've clocked just over 7 hours and I've spent at least 3 of them mining and doing freelancer missions. The campaign itself is somewhere between 2 and 3 hours at best.  -You don't get any advanced ships or weaponry during the campaign. All of the rewards from the story missions combine to about 100k which is the price of a single high end piece of equipment. Top of the line ships meanwhile cost upwards of 2 million. Thus you'll spend most if not all of the story flying a starter ship or one marginally better and if you want the end-game stuff, you'll have a lot of grinding to do.  -While we're on the subject of the story, it's quite mundane. Without spoiling too much, it boils down to some gibberish-speaking aliens popping up all over the universe and stealing cargo and we have to stop them. Who are they, why are they doing this, is there more to this? Who cares, just shoot them.  -The universe is underdeveloped. There are 4 different factions but I only noticed that when one of them started shooting me because I got friendly with their enemies. Who are they and why are they fighting is a mystery. Naturally, you can't affect the wars (which incidentally would've made for a much better campaign than what we got)  -The combat. It feels like a poor man's Freelancer combat and that game is what... 10, 15 years old? I think it suffers from being developed for mobile devices.  -Lack of support. Apparently the developers were very surprised (and quite unpleasantly so) by the fact that PC players didn't throw twenties at them for the 2 hour experience and they've decided to essentially take their ball and go home to the iOS crowd that has more money than brains. As a result this is all we're going to get. No patches, no DLC, no modding support, nothing.  -The developers themselves. Looking over a few of their replies to their customers, reveals them to be quite arrogant and obnoxious.  -The price. Frankly, the game is overpriced for what it is. If they had bundled the DLC with it, MAYBE it would be worth 20 bucks. As it stands, it most certainly isn't.  In conclusion, while the game has it's moments, I can't recommend it at it's current price. If you can get it on sale 70% + off, go for it. Otherwise, stay away",

            "review_text": "Okay, and for the real review.  Do not get me wrong, this game is pretty good, but, this game can pretty much be completed within 6 hours. The graphics are good, it plays really well. The controls are responsive. But it's short lived without the DLC.  It's free on Android and iOS, and you can pay $15.00 for the DLC not including the Kaamo Club + VIP.  Honestly, if you have a good tablet I would say stick to playing this game on Android and iOS, instead of playing it on PC Steam because you're paying full price for an incomplete release of the game... It's really bogus and unfair, considering that deepsilver is selling this game on steam for this price with little to no hope of the dlc being released...   This is a fun game, but you're better off staying on Android with this one.",

I have played the original GoF 1 on Java, GoF 2 on Java, later full HD on android, played all expansions on android, and even play on the GoF online game 'Alliances'. You can safely say I love the series.  Do not get me wrong with the downvote. The game itself, is very good, playable, and advanced - for a game that target is mobile gaming. Graphics are beautiful, controls are well designed, you have varied choice of ships (altho, in the core it boils down to freighters/fighters)  The story plot is enough to keep you entertained for several hours, interesting, engaging, and even humorous at times. Definetly the title I would recommend to another space sim player.  But here, we get started on the reason of the downvote. The developers uploaded the base game to steam and put a price tag on it. That's it. No updates. Players pooled together, asking for release of expansions to the Steam/PC version. Unfortunately the Developer stated that none of this will be ever coming to PC.  Save your money here, and go purchase it on your Smartphone store (whatever phone/system you have).  There is a bunch of additional content and missions available on the developed mobile version of the game. Of course, you pay for expansions, but myself, I find that they are worth the money.",

You end up in the midst of a war and need to find your own place between 4 warring factions as well as pirates and the Voids, an alien species no one knows much about.  This game offers a wide selection of vessels to suit your various needs, you can work in mining, as an escort, a freighter, rescuing politicians, as a merchant, cleaning up garbage and so on and so one.  You can also hire other ships to help you out.  Each ship is customizable with various slots and there is a tonne of different types of equipments to choose from. Suffice to say you have a lot of stuff to play around with yet it never overwhelms you.  The graphics are very nice and the music score fits very well. Controls as decent although could be better but nothing that detracts from the experience.  The achievements are both in game and in steam and fill a purpose in-game as every medal you gain you earn more cash from your assignments.  The story is also nice to follow along and if you finish it before finishing all the achievements you're free to keep playing on and characters in the game will respond differently to you.  All-in-all this is a good game and I recomend it, it will give you 20-25 hours of good gameplay.",

That said, I stopped playing it within the first few hours. Weeks later I installed it again, to give it a second chance, and again stopped playing it within the first few hours.  I, honestly, found the game didn't hold my attention. I've played games similar to this one and have been extremely drawn in by not only the galaxy but the story content, 'Freelancer' comes to mind. That said, this game really didn't have anything for me. I found the space missions to be somewhat short and rather dull. The commentary, aka storyline, lost my interest before I even left the first station. Graphics were a little dated. Equipment and effects seemed plain and ordinary. There really wasn't anything to keep my attention. This game isn't for me. Note, I said 'for me'.  The whole reason I got this game is because it came highly recommended by some Freelancer playing friends of mine, so I thought I'd give it a whirl. Obviously they liked it, which means there are people out there (perhaps you) who will enjoy it as well. For me, it failed to entertain.  I'm not going to recommend it, as I personally didn't enjoy it. I'd much rather stick to Freelancer, which may be a dated game (so is this one) but is still, in my opinion, at the forefront of the space RPG and has an extensively powerful modding community.",

The graphics are great and the HD is well deserved. The Gameplay itself is rly smoothed and it's really easy to fly around. The story itself (you travel through the time, not on purpouse, and got to defeat the 'Void') is fast played and I rly wished it was deeper, e.g. what do the Void want? Why do they rob the other nations etc. Or, Why are same nations in war and others not? They could've made much more out of it, but OK it was meant to be a game for mobiles, so whatever :) After you beat the Storyline you can do sidequests, explore the other systems and mess around farming to get the best ship. Or jsut get all the achivments on Steam!  I rly wish they think about converting the AddOns on PC as well... It's kinda sad they gave us only half of the game. I really want the two AddOns. Please. Please..  Anyways! Great game, Not sure if worth the 15 bucks, because the story is kinda flat and short and all you can do afterwards is exploring and farming, but if it gets on sale I'd highly recommend it. Fun Game, nice setting and hella fun. 8/10",

It looked like a splendid game with stunning graphics for such an oldie and.. what's this?? Voice acting?! My WORD! How did they ever fit all of that onto a few A: discs back then?? It's like Elite but...like..MORE Elite! Wow! And GUNS! You can shoot GUNS! And a space station?! And..and...you can buy things! And when you fly around you actually fly AROUND, like, 3D like! None of that silly business where you look down upon your ship and fire up the screen at a formation of drones but....  Okay, look... I'm laying on the sarcasm as hard as possible because somehow this game was actually being sold for actual money. I'm not sure if anyone else noticed but the ship moves so slow I kept expecting a granny with a walker to float by. 'Combat' is laughable because the dogfighting is more like watching fish lull around in a tank. I tried crashing into the space station but...no...that didn't help make the game more fun. I guess mining is the cool part because it presents the only challenge in the game. And...um...whatever. This game was released just a couple years ago but I would have pegged it for a couple decades instead.  Unless someone can tell me how to unlock 'FUN MODE' then I'm just going to say that it's a pile of crap.  Anyone know how to 'give away' a game on here? You can have my key. This game is garbage.

This was very easy getting into it and play for fun. Learning curve is very low which I enjoyed when in mood of a casual game.  This game has difficulty setting you can choose from Easy to Hard. I went with Easy difficulty and spent 25 hours playing to 100% completed the game. In a perspective of achievements, this game can get a bit grindy but that feeling came very late when I only needed several hours to finish off this game. The story itself is unfortunately very short. I did not count but probably around 10-15 story missions at most. That is quite short.    So obviously the aim of this game is not the story but rather immersing yourself in a relatively small galaxy doing side missions to make money here and there. There is also mining. Mining was very simple to do in this game, can be difficult or easy depending on Mining equipment you have. Combat wise, you will find it similar to some of very simple arcade games you played before. If you have not play anything like this, I would take an extra step and tell you that this game will be an ideal game to play. Again, very simple and easy get into the game. It should take no more than an hour to get that feeling of this game.   Overall, I enjoyed this game I picked up from a bundle. I'd rate it between 7 to 7.5 out of 10.",

Selling Implants, Collectible Figures, Vossk Organs, you basically just jump from system to system and then you’ll have 300,000+ money. Easy no need to grind ores through mining.  The battle too gets boring and repetitive for a while. After obtaining Vossk Ship H'Soc and because it has 2 primary weapon slots; installing Berger Retribution and ReHeat o10 and your ship will overpower almost every ship at this point (6 hours of gameplay).  The only problem with this Steam version is the lack of DLCs. No DLC means you will never be able to purchase your own space station which enables you to 'switch' between your ships. Shame after all the hardwork the developers have put in this version.  Fun and the planets are nice to look at but it could have been better if the game was designed in PC or console in mind; from what I see the developers designed it as a mobile game which is a shame.",

I honestly wouldnt mind trying a higher difficulty if there was an insentive, but the equipment is pretty limited compared to other space games (I basicly hit the best equipment within 4 hours of play time). After I got my gear I was expecting to hit harder areas especially since some were considered 'risky' and 'dangerous', but the difficulty seemed to stay roughly the same. My problems with the game summarized would be: there is only 1 ship class size available (that I know of), the run time is to short, and there is a serious lack of equipment variences. I believe there is only 3 different lvls to each type of equipment, which means that you could honestly have one of the best weapons in the game within farming 40k-80k which may take you an hour at the start.   Also on a side note I hated the mining :P it was a pain in the butt to do and it wasnt particularly worth it compared to mugging people.",

There's no shortage of content in terms of different ships, weapons and commodities to deal with, and the story, while bland, is presented reasonably well.  Unfortunately on PC it doesn't play well, though. The combat feels slow and sluggish, and it looks very silly when objects clip through one another, clearly in absence of any collision detection. On higher difficulties the game occasionally spawns hordes of enemies which I could neither defeat nor escape from alive, which felt very cheap indeed.  On tablet I could recommend this game, but on PC it's simply outclassed by games like X3 or Freelancer.",

It's a mobile/tablet port that's just better off staying on that platform because the control interface suits it well than a mouse or joystick. I was really looking forward to another flight sim that has joystick capabilities. It works but it doesn't feel exactly right.  What I didn't like about this game were the terrible reverse physics logic, voice acting, the characters, side missions on REPEAT just to continue to raise money, and Mission 11. What I mean when I say 'reverse physics logic' is the sad idea that certain objects are not approachable and others are. If you approach a capital ship or a space station and you're too close it will auto redirect your flight path or simply PUSH you in another direction. Whereas, if you're NEAR an asteroid in passing, then it randomly explodes just because you're near it and you haven't really come in contact with it. It's terrible. Also, there's no such thing as collision with OTHER space craft! The voice acting and characters feel phoned in and hammy. As stated before, the side missions are only there to raise money and maybe raise your tech level but there's only a few types as they're constantly RECYCLED missions. Endlessly there to provide work for you so you can raise millions of dollars for the ships and equipment you'll use. Mission 11 is quite possibly the worst mission in this game because it revolves around mining. Anyone who's played this mission will say I'm whining because I suck yet something tells me they only had to deal with TWO enemy space craft whereas I had to fight against SIX. With superiror ships like the Veteran and Anaan (granted not THE best ship compared to others), I still got destroyed countless times trying to complete the most boring aspect of this game.  What I liked about this game is simple. It looks great visually with all the graphics and designs along with the variety of space craft to offer. With each space craft, they have their own unique stats and equipment slots you can customize with. That's it. Pretty game with many space craft options and the abilities.  I only recommend this when it goes on sale. If you feel like you wasted your money, even then, I can understand. See for yourself and come up with your own opinion.",

You won't really need spread sheets for this game, but these things are not bad. Visually, I was surprised how well it looks and runs considering that it was designed for the mobile market.  The breakdown: PROS - Nice visuals  - Easy to get into, and non linear if you want the open exploration style and don't do the main story  - Decent ship, race and weapon variety  - Contoller set up works well (did not play with a flight stick or keyboard) in flight  CONS - Enemy AI is near non-existant in most situations  - You can only lock on to 1 target at a time, and sometimes if the reticle is on an enemy ship, but close to a neutral or ally ship it will target that ship instead.  - Mining asteriods is a minigame (this is just a personal preference for me, didn't care for it)  Good game as long as you know what to expect, and on sale at $5 how can I not recommend it?",

            "review_text": "I've said before that fans of space trading/combat sim fans have waited for years for a decent game. Elite, Privateer and Freelancer have not had any particularly brillant successors.  Galaxy on Fire is good, and does still belong at very the end of that list. The ship designs are excellent, weapons fire, local stars and nebula look beautiful. The sounds are great, and the music is awesome even if it gets repetitive after a couple of hours.   I found the overall experience astonishing on ipad, because of what the developers were able to run on such a weak gaming platform, but on PC it's a lot less impressive, even with the higher resolution textures. Visuals are better than Freelancer, not as good as X3.  The combat is simple, but fun, and very reminisent of Freelancer. Upgrading your ship is rewarding and will keep you cracking through the game despite the lacklustre storyline and it's cheesy cartoon characters.   The trading is very simple, with no real economy to speak of, so if you're a fan of X3 or Eve Online because of the economy and empire building aspect of the gameplay, then this won't be enough to keep you interested for very long.  The DLC availble for the ipad version is not availble for the PC release.  My advice - if you spend a lot of time gaming on an ipad - then get it FREE in SD (or very cheap in HD) from the app store. If you want it for PC and the price isn't cheap enough for you, wait until Elite 4 or Star Citizen come out in 2015-onwards. Good luck space sim fans, and hang in there... good stuff is coming, our long wait will soon be over.",
