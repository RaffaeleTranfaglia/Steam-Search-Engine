            "review_text": " What’s Good:   - A solid gameplay formula for loot hunting/exp grinders out there - Each class has a good variety of abilities to progress and choose from - Randomized maps make each session feel relatively fresh - Varied biomes for each area made them feel distinct. One area in particular was very bizarre and unexpected. - Various events on the map were nice and sometimes would feature more than just combat with puzzle gameplay - Day/Night cycle system that changes up the adventuring experience - Companion system that allows you to obtain nearly every enemy in the game as a combat pet and level them up - Crafting system - Good amount enemy types/bosses/minibosses - Main boss encounters were mostly unique with an interesting fight strategy and not just damage sponges. - I liked all the exp combos and awards you could earn from combat, it made each encounter feel rewarding. - Various mini-games were nice extras even if they weren't vital to the gameplay (Fishing, Mining, Slot Machines) - Hard mode available for those looking for more challenge and replay value - I've seen frequent patches with bugfixes and other small changes which is a great sign of active devs that care   What’s Bad:   - Would have been nice if the storage stash in town was shared between characters to allow you to transfer items between them. - Game completion progress is shared between your characters which some players may not like, quests are repeatable though. - Waypoints are nice, but I wish there was one in each major outpost. When playing early on I wasn't finding any so was making long treks through low level areas trying to get where I need to go. - The overall journey did feel kind of samey as you essentially go from outpost to outpost doing a handful of quests at each, if you just enjoy exploring and killing mobs this may not be an issue with you though as you are free to do this at any time. - While this may not bother some players, the game is very gear dependent as important stat values like HP mostly come from gear and gems which enhance your gear. Without the HP buffs from gear I found myself getting killed instantly quite often. - The dungeons while varied in appearance, seemed very similar layout wise and typically involved moving from room to room clearing enemies until you found the exit. I may have preferred the main dungeons to have been hand-crafted experiences and keeping the randomized ones for optional locations within the world.   Controls",

Combat is kinda sluggish for the type it is. Not fond of having to stop to cast a spell or change skills while fighting.",

There is a main story that will take you through the game however you are really losing out if you dont just go on an adventure. Take the time and explore with a friend or 3. This game is worth the cost and much much more!!",

Then later on I got to yell at my teammate for failing to heal me while she cackled like a madwoman.  Then I started to explode everything around me with vials of fire.  So you know, all in all, good times.  PS: About the only bad thing I can say is that I had to farm for gear and gem recipe because they're far superior to anything you can find in the world, but that's mostly my decision to do so.  PSS: People complaining about Epic mode being too hard probably failed to read the extremely prominent mention when setting it that it's for a party of 4 that are above level 15. Not sure what's unclear about this!",
