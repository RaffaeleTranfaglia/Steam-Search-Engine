            "review_text": "TL;DR: Since the developer has abandoned the project and the remaining episodes will not be made/released in the foreseeable future I wouldn't spend your money on this. Its story is incomplete and will probably never be completed. In the end by paying $5 for this you'll have 1.5 hours of prologue that is, in itself, not nearly enough to leave you satisfied.   Update: As of July 14th, 2015 Dischan Media has officially shut down. Dysfunctional Systems: Learning to Manage Chaos will not be reinvigorated.   Game review:   Dysfunctional Systems is a visual novel about, as the title inclines, the managing of chaos. The premise of dysfunctional systems revolves around an organisation in some technological utopia that sends meddlers to other worlds to solve their problems and reclaim order. It's an interesting concept, but it's not too different from what we've seen before. That said, it doesn't mean dysfunctional systems has no potential, in fact it has loads of potential. Too bad none of that really matters.  The story is basically an introduction to the universe and it's characters. We get to see the main characters do their jobs as meddlers in a world that is having diplomatic problems. Things escalate, I won't spoil anything, I'll just say that: it's way too short to develop anything outside of a prologue to the other episodes. Yes, there is a story in it, no you're probably not going to cry over it. It isn't insanely good and it isn't bad. At best this will leave you wanting more, where the problem of an abandoned project reels in again.   Even if an incomplete story wouldn't bother you, this first episode leaves too much to be desired and too many questions to be asked. The game is way too short to accomplish any real world building, something that is so important when your game is literally about travelling and meddling in the affairs of other worlds.   The characters, focusing on the two main ones, consist of your basic grumpy teacher and stubborn student. That's not to say the characters aren't enjoyable or not well written, they share some funny and touching moments. It's just that the game is simply way too short to develop any character properly. Thus we are left with... again, nothing special.   Then there are the choices, which are very important to get right when you make something in this medium. It is unfortunately something dysfunctional functions had a serious lack of. The entire game basically has 1 choice. 1 choice in the entire thing. After this one choice dysfunctional systems might (depending on what you choose) present you 2-or so more rather confusing choices.  Too bad none of these matter. At all.  The only difference is that you'll be getting a different achievement.   Something I can praise dysfunctional systems about is it's amazing art and music.  The art, although perhaps a bit repetitive at times, looks amazing, there isn't a whole lot of animation but that's alright, in the end I wasn't expecting there to be any. The UI is really good, everything fits together nicely and I actually enjoyed reading the few codex entries there were, as bland as they may be. As for the music, it was very nicely done. You won't have the same track looping every other sequence or anything like that here. Good stuff, Ill probably end up listening to it more in the future.    The real reason you shouldn't buy this:   After all that I do feel the need to honestly say that Dysfunctional Systems: Learning to Manage Chaos is not a bad visual novel at all, at least, as a prologue. Sure, it doesn't hit all the good spots and the lack of choices is pretty disappointing. But that doesn't mean it's necessarily bad. It does it's job as a prologue - it gets you excited for more whilst giving a basic introduction of the universe.  The real reason you shouldn't buy this is because the developer abandoned the two sequels that were originally planned. Reason? Financial problems and a lack of motivation. The development team did a poor job of financing the funds received from the kickstarter campaign. People have lost a lot of their trust for the developers, and righteously so, it was one big mistake after another for the dev team and the death of Dysfunctional Systems as a result of that. It's a real shame, I would have liked to see more from this.   So, in the end Dysfunctional Systems: Learning to Manage Chaos gives us a 1.5 hour prologue of a story that will probably never be made. Whether you are willing to spend $5 on that is your choice, but I personally wouldn't recommend it.",

            "review_text": "Let me preface this by saying that I really, really enjoyed Dysfunctional Systems. However, I cannot in good conscience recommend this for many people. Let me explain.  Firstly, what I did like about Dysfunctional Systems. While very short, the story is extremely compelling in terms of the writing, and especially the premise, which is very unique and one of my favorite aspects. The interface is very slick and polished, and the art and character design is fantastic. I absolubtely loved my short romp through the world(s) of Dysfunctional Systems, and I sincerely wish I could spend more time in that world.  Unfortunately, this brings me to why I ultimately cannot recommend Dysfunctional Systems despite its fantastic setting, storywriting, and art direction. Dysfunctional Systems was originally created with the intent of being a 3 episode series, which was funded through kickstarter. However, Dischan, the creators of Dysfunctional Systems have confirmed the cancellation of the release of the next installment of Dysfunctional Systems, and have put the entire series on indefinite hiatus, and most likely permanent cancellation.  I cannot recommend Dysfunctional Systems: Learning to Manage Chaos because the entire VN was clearly centered around the notion that it fit into a greater story, and the endings of Learning to Manage Chaos are clearly structered around this assumption. While Learning to Manage Chaos is a great story for what it is, it does not work very well as a standalone story.  If you are willing to play what was suppossed to be the opening for a greater story, then go ahead and get Dysfunctional Systems: Learning to Manage Chaos. If you feel like you will be dissapointed by the notion the story is incomplete, then please avoid this title.   It's a pity really because I really did like the premise and setting of Dysfunctional Systems.",

The graphics are anime looking and the story is clever and well done. I really enjoyed this game and all it had to offer. I beat it a couple of times to get all the achievements and to see how many different ways the story can play out differently. if you grinded through the story with alot of clicks or using a macro you can easily get all the achievements in about 30 minutes easily. I really liked this book. I highly recommend getting this game if you would like a good read.",

If you already know what a visual novel is, then you're probably going to enjoy this. It has a very intruiging story, and it's got me hooked for more.  As for the soundtrack, it is absolutely beautiful. I LOVE the main theme, and everything else adds to the ambience very well.  I will recommend this game, but if you aren't familiar with visual novels take the advice of other people.

It quickly pulled me in, and easily kept my attention. And while the entire story, if I'd played out my first set of choices without any rethinking at all would have been short, it was definitely interesting to go back and see all of the consequeces for alternate paths, and look at the other courses that were available. The characters, though only allowing for a small amount of exposition in the space given, seemed very fully developed, and were consistent to their apparent personalities, without any seemingly random mood swings with no explanation.  The plotline and setting itself were both very interesting, but there is definitely room to grow. For the amount of information that is presented, it could easily be expanded upon, even if only through secondary, non-essential entries in the game's codex, or information accessible through the main menu, but what is shown through the story is very entertaining. A powerful climax of the story, and... realistic, if not entirely satisfying ending following, result in a story that definitely makes me want to read further.",

There's also no voices, which can be bad for people like me who have poor reading comprehension. That's all the negative aspects out of the way.  In DS, you will enjoy an extremely well-written script. With a great deal of backstory and detail, the universe is very believable and makes it a pleasure to immerse yourself within the world and its inhabitants. Even with my reading comprehension issues, I found myself focusing all my attention to understand the remarkably deep story. The characters are interesting and complex to the point where you won't find any stereotypes that you may have grown accustomed to. The art in its own merit may not stand out, but when coupled with many others of the same genre, it definitely rises up and stands out from the common crowd. A lot of the music is forgettable, and you may not want to listen to it in your car or on an iPod. But every track seems to harmonize with the story and situations on-screen. The music is immensely atmospheric and envelops the reader in the narrative.  The greatest strength in this story is the setting. It is so very interesting that you will eat it up and ask for more. I can only hope that development for the second episode will eventually begin so that this story can continue.",

The game is excrutiatingly short, and it is extended to just below reasonable by the slow text boxes. Seriously I feel the transistions and text alone double the game time. The choices are few within the game, I can say I don't have a lot of VN experience but I would've expected more than 2 real interactive dialog points. Even at a low price of $5 it still seems like you aren't getting the full value per dollar. The seemingly branching path does add some replay value but using a save is much easier than wading through the text wall that leads up to the 3-5 questions as nothing mentioned is necessary or even relevant to your responses.  The game appears to be setting up for a much larger sequel and that may or may not pend on the success of this one.

If you are in any way familiar with Dischan's free visual novel, 'Juniper's Knot,' you'll know where I am coming from.  [IN FACT, TRY THAT ONE OUT FIRST, AS IT IS FREE AND GIVES YOU THE FEEL OF THEIR STORIES JUST LOOK IT UP ON GOOGLE OR SOMETHIN'.] The characters all have their own personality to me, and that is sometimes hard to find when you have more than one or two characters the story focuses on. I believe that this series will have more than two crucial characters. Sometimes they all just blob together, but, well, if you play this and see the characters, you'll know who I'm talking about.  I would like to say that the story begins with Winter Harrison, who's an apprentice of sorts to help manage chaotic worlds. She is mentored by a certain Cyrus Addington - whom I absolutely adore, though that is beyond the point - and the two are sent to a certain world that is about to go over the boiling point. The music. The music fit in so well with the story, and I never really got pulled out of my reading to think, 'Hey, this music really doesn't fit in at all.' The atmospheric sounds brought me to believe this world actually existed, and I particularly love a certain song that plays in a certain place (WOW GURL Y U NO SPOIL).  The twist in this episode really got to me. I didn't expect it at all, and I love that in a story. Too many times am I reading and I completely called the big climax, but this one had me floored. Granted, I may have just been tired and woozy from something. But I think that it was well played out by Dischan. It made me feel something; I almost gave in. When I was done, I sat there just revelling in what had happened, then jumped back in to see if I could change it. Because this episode has a crucial choice that you have to make, and you are able to save multiple stories where your decision can impact how the characters look at you and how your character looks at herself. I have played games where your decisions don't matter at all, and you get the same speech from the same people over and over and over as you try to find some variety. This one is almost completely written differently. It may be because the choice I'm speaking of is rather drastic, but I felt as though the developers did well in almost completely rewriting how everything turns out. Winter will actuall respond to your choice. It can and will have dire consequences. I am writing this review because I believe that not enough people know this game even exists. I just found it randomly on Steam, for a really low price. That may be my only complaint here: the price. Dischan has ceased development on the sequel to save their money, as they really didn't have much to begin with since this story was rather glossed over by some. Hopefully, this review may bring more people to enjoy the story and coax the developers back onto their feet so they can give us the next chapter in this story.",

I was given very little time to really get into the story and the characters before it abruptly ended.  But all of that aside, I like Dysfunctional Systems. The aesthetics, music, characters and world are all beautiful and engaging. The few choices I had were harrowing and had an effect, however limited, on the story. I had been impatiently waiting for the first choice to come up thoughout the first section, and when it did I was left dumbstruck. I had no idea what to do.

            "review_text": "I'd like to recommend this game, I truly would but I cannot do so in good faith. There are a few very key flaws with this game that prevent me from being able to recommend it. I don't regret the purchase and I did enjoy it, for as short as it was but I imagine a lot of people could easily be put off by the experience. In fact I'm probably being very lenient on it myself.  Dysfunctional Systems: Learning to Manage Chaos is the first in a series. The following installments have yet to be released but will be longer and also must be purchased individually. It is a visual novel that relies heavily on immersing players with story and characters, with the only gameplay being making choices throughout the story to change how things go. But here comes the biggest issue. Throughout the course of the game, I made one choice. Literally one. In other words, this was a short story, not a game. I cannot call something that had such bare minimum interaction a game. The game itself also only lasted around two hours. The length wouldn't be a big issue, since it is cheap and I got it on sale, but the fact there's only one choice throughout is a damn joke.  However, the appeal in a game like this is that you can go down other paths, see what happens if you choose another option, right? And I'm sure if I picked the other option, I'd have at least one more choice to make, based on what I've seen. I don't know for sure though, since I haven't been able to replay this game. Attempting to reopen the game gets me an error message, one which haunts me no matter how many times I reinstall, verify game cache or restart my computer. The game doesn't even work properly.  The third key issue is one that's going to bring down the wrath of men's right's activists everywhere on me. The extras in this game include artwork. Some of this artwork is fanmade and portrays the (underage) female characters of the game in risque positions. This automatically makes the creator's respect for his characters come across as shallow, as he willingly keeps extras that objectify and sexually exploit his characters in the game. Apparently this is because of a dislike for retroactive censoring. I think a bigger issue is the ominous aura that now surrounds this game and its characters, that no matter how well developed or interesting they may be, ultimately they will be used for shameless fanservice.  I want to end this review with some positives. While it was short, it was still a great story. It centers around two main characters, Winter Harrison and Cyrus Addington. Both these characters are not only entertaining but very interesting, with unique backgrounds and moral beliefs. I don't want to spoil anything so I won't give away the most interesting aspects. I do hope both characters reappear through the series and that both characters are treated with respect. There was some soapboxing from one character in terms of moral values that irritated me but hopefully that was the character talking and not the game trying to force its ethical views.  The art and music are also fantastic. I do want to stress that this is a great visual novel, just not really a game. More than anything, it's the fact that it's not opening for me any more that'd most keep me from recommending it. Otherwise, if you're okay with getting a good story in place of a game, go for it.",

Only other time I think was Persona 4 Arena. Since this is a VN, expect reading. A lot of it.  The story is Winter shadowing her mentor and learning the trade of mediation: reviewing dysfunctional systems: learning to manage chaos. The back-story itself is good too, if you can wrap your head around different planes of existence (with rigid (real) to loose (fantasy/magic) physics). People from Winter's dimension (where violence hardly exists) go to different worlds in different dimensions, and indirectly (or if needed, directly) help solve their problems to 'reduce chaos.' These problems range from economical woes to the destruction of soloar systems, and everything in between. The smallest decisions can alter the greatest of events. Sometimes, the greatest of decisions can't change the outcome.  Main character, Winter, is considerably witty and self aware while conflicted with her 14 year old naivety, rebeliousness, and need to be autonomous. I get a kick out of reading her internal dialogues.  Things will get sad. Things will get depressing. Things will feels. Things will get intense. Things will escalate quickly. Oh and keep an eye on the characters, their expressions DO change when they're talking. Better immersion and conveyance of character emotion. Same goes with some of the still framed art with characters in it. Those expressions.",
