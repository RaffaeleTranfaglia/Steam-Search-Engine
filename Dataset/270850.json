            "review_text": "Before you ask, no, you won't learn how to replace your busted clutch or how to find that squeaky sound underneath your car- it's not that type of game. What you will find, however, is a great puzzle game that is a breath of fresh air compared to the thousands of other puzzle games out there.  The premise is simple: you own a mechanic shop, and people bring you cars (problems) to fix. You get a short blurb to tell you a bit of information, but the amount of information that you get can vary- going from 'Hey, my battery is dead, can you fix it?' to 'Something squeaks under the car. Fix it.' Your goal is to find and fix the problem while trying not to run out of cash- you get an extra amount of cash for each order, and if that runs out, you can ask the bank for a loan that you have to pay back. To be honest, though, if you're careful about what you buy and aren't replacing stuff willy-nilly, you ought to be fine. Just remember- fix it if you can, or replace it outright if you need to.  And don't worry about losing parts- the game will not only make you remove items in order off the car, but it will also force you to put them back in order, as well- there's no need to worry about missing any parts- unless it's something like a starter or a plastic engine cover, but even then it won't let you mark it as done until the car is completely put back together.  Once each objective is met, you'll be able to mark the car as 'fixed' and send it on its way.  There are over seventy problems in the base game alone- plus another twenty in the DLC pack that comes free with the game. There's another free DLC pack launching later this month with another pack of problems, and that will add even more value to it.   The problems I have with this game are actually somewhat slight- for one, some of the detection on th orders can be really, REALLY picky. If it tells you to replace the right front tire, then your new wheel must go on the right front- you can't just move a used wheel from the other side of the car onto there, because it's not explicitly a new wheel. It's smart to take big orders a step at a time for this reason- work on one region of the car at a time, and replace everything needed- or make notes as to what the busted parts were. There is nothing more swear-worthy in this game than completing a huge order, but being unable to continue because you didn't put some tiny part back in its right space- and then you have to pull the whole blasted thing apart to hunt for it.  The only other complaint I have is that you will want to hit the radio with a wrench and kill it dead after a half-hour of its awful music. If you need music, bust out an iPod or turn on an actual radio, because this one will make you want to take it out to the test track and drive over it a few dozen times. Would it have been too much to ask to get a simple MP3 player in there or something?  All in all, though, if you're looking for a puzzle game that isn't something about jewels, you'll enjoy this- especially if you have an interest in cars.",

            "review_text": "After reading several reviews and noticing it was on sale, I decided to give this game a try. I have a Quad Core 3.8ghz AMD, GeForce 730 2gb Graphics Card, and 8gb DDR3 RAM. As soon as I loaded up the first vehicle in the game, I experienced low framerates. I exited and changed the video settings to Quality High, Resolution 1280x720, VSync OFF, Antialiasing DISABLED (These are the same settings I use for DayZ, which gives me 40+FPS). I now have 0 drop in framerate, and the game still looks beautiful. I've been an experienced mechanic for over 10 years. I am a certified CNC Machinist, as well as a certified Mercedes-Benz Technician. I've been a gamer since the NES days. The graphics are really good, and I haven't experienced any noticeable bugs, glitches, or clipping issues. The sound is ok, but nothing to brag about. I did listen to the radio, but had turned it down 50% before I even started. I never found it to be annoying. Movement around the shop environment is pretty smooth. No issues there. The game starts every level with a worksheet that explains what the customer wants you to check for or replace. Great thing is, you can refer back to this worksheet at anytime. Most of the parts can be visually inspected without removing them, but a lot of parts can only be inspected upon removing something in front of it (i.e. a timing belt before inspecting the water pump). The electrical components must be checked using the OBD Scan Tool. You are also able to test drive vehicles in order to diagnose bad parts, and the physics are good. Right clicking the mouse opens a menu allowing you to install parts, remove parts, turn the chassis transparency off/on, and turn the parts color, such as red, yellow, and green corresponding to the condition, off/on. Some of the parts can simply be removed, others must be unbolted and bolted back on. Everything must be installed in the reverse order of removal. Yes, you can forget to install parts, but you cannot give the car back to the customer until you fix your mistakes. The game automatically checks tasks off your worksheet as you complete them. After a little over an hour of playing, I found this game to be very fun. I'm impressed that any developer would tackle a game like this, and with such detail. Don't expect it to be 100% realistic, such as every nut and bolt, accurate pricing, names of cars, etc. I don't think anyone could learn the basics of car repair from this game, but I do think someone can use this game to understand the overall concept of automotive repair. I honestly don't have anything bad to say about this game. I wish the concept of this game would've implemented on Forza, Grand Turismo, or Need For Speed a long time ago! If you're interested in automotive repair, get this game now that it's on sale.",

            "review_text": "I graduated as a car mechanic back in 1996 and therefore i was very curious how such a game would be. Basically its a good game that delivers an amount of entertainment that matches the pricetag.  Besides replacing spareparts the game has a testcourse where you can drive the car thru obstacles to check that its working properly.....however it always works properly on the test course as bad dampers etc doesnt affect the driving experience, so the test track isnt really of any help in regards of finding out whats wrong with the car.  The missions are straight forward in the sense that you get a sheet listing the problems to be solved and some things are more puzzling that others and that gives the game a touch of reality.  It does kinda lack the things like 'sound and feel' that you get irl when testdriving a car, where youll be able to tell if the dampers are failing, steering is slugish, engine isnt running right aso.  That leaves you with the option to check all the parts and replace the worn ones to ensure theyre working properly. On that part I find it hard to define when the game accepts partially worn, but not worn out, parts to be left on the car or not, sometimes itll accept partially worn parts and other times it has to be 100% condition.  Again, adding some rl touch would highly increase the gameplay, like in a real shop when you get a job where the customer says 'Imma drive 2000 miles on vacation in my car, can you check it and make sure its up for it?' you can get to use your judgement on which parts to replace/fix and based on how well you do it, the customer will be more or less happy about the job you did.  Also adding the ability to buy up used cars, fix them up and puttem out for sale on the lot would be a nice feature as well, kinda like the way you could in 'Gearhead Garage'.  All in all, the game is good and i do recommend it, but I also hope to see some implementation of the features mentioned, I wouldnt mind if it came as addons in the form of DLC @ maybe 10 EUR or so each.",

First appearance of the game when we start up is clean and simple which are good but some option need to be added which they will in upcoming patch.  We start career mode and get under way graphics are good for simulator maybe little heavy on the reflection nice chrome texture we get first job you have job sheet which gives you rough idea what issue maybe and you need to find and fix this issue in start this can be little tricky but there are some things you can use to help make game play easier with high lighted parts etc  Controls are very nice and smooth once setup feel great no major issues  Test drive mode is low on scale but does help in sourcing the issues same with the scanner etc  mission do slowly get harder and harder but for some people they might find it repetitive but i liked it its not to hard so some one with no car knowledge could play it  It took me around 20 hours to complete the game which is good for simulator and developers have been more than helpful when facing an issue and im looking forward to DLC and possible 2015 version its a game which as lots of space to grow and become bigger i hope the developers run with that and build on what they have.  Some people wont like the game and some will and for what the game is the price is right  my rating is 10/10",

            "review_text": "I recommend this game solely because it is fun. But it leaves a lot to be desired. This is a review about as game that could have been much better, and instead is just a fun play if you get it cheap.  The 'simulation' aspect is weak. I am not saying that the game is bad, I am saying that I wish it was better. For instance, a customer's car won't start: I thought it would be a good idea to check the battery cables but alas there are none. There are also no radiators, no fluid in the transmissions, no tire pressure, the list goes on.   The game also features repairs of an individual part; you can, apparently, repair a water pump! I have never known a mechanic to repair something like that. Maybe it can be done but typically they just install a new part on your car and charge you for it. The only part-repairs I have seen are things like splicing wires or welding a busted exhaust pipe. Simple stuff.  The pricing is crazy too. People are spending over 10,000 USD to repair used cars. Things like a new battery cost 350 USD even though they can typically be had for under 100 USD in real life. Other things are odd too, spark plugs are 35 USD but again in real life they are perhaps 2-5 USD.   The game play gets tiring. In the beginning you are using your mind to try and troubleshoot problems and find a damaged part. As the game goes on you learn to, 1: diagnostic scan; 2: test drive; 3: path test; 4: click hide body and show part condition. 9/10 times it will show the damaged parts in red and then you just have to spend the time disassembling the vehicle. The only time this won't show you the damaged part is if its in the transmission or if its the air filter. Very little challenge at that point.  The 4X4 add on is a good idea but it mostly consists of unlicensed Jeep Wrangler models. Not One Pickup, Not on Land Rover, Not One V8, Not One Lift Kit.  The 1/4 mile add on is the best part of the game. In the beginning you have limited money to upgrade the parts and tune a car to hit a 1/4 mile time. This too grows easy over time as the budget increases you start having enough money to simply buy ALL the performance parts for each car. Most of the bolt-ons give ridiculous amounts of extra power. Worst of all, there are no Cold Air Intakes in a performance shop - just crazy. Unfortunately, while drag racing there is no shifting to be done by the player even though many of the vehicles have manual transmissions. What a shame, its one of the main aspects of drag racing titles that you find on your mobile phone.  This could have been an incredible game - and I hope they make another one, because developers can usually build on simulations until they are truly great. For now, its a fun game and I gladly played through the whole thing. I think its enjoyable, but it won't give you any real world knowledge. It might be damaging if you learned that its normal to pay 800 USD for a mechanic to install a new battery, or perhaps you think that your transmission ought not have any fluid in it. I don't consider this any more educational than I do Need For Speed Hot Pursuit. But its still fun - Happy Gaming.",

It does a really great job of showing the basic mechanics of a car. The symptoms seem to correlate well to the solutions, but I'm no mechanic. I'm actually motivated to do some work on my own car now that I have a better idea of how things fit together.  Cons: I think my mechanic is drunk. What is with the first person interface? Is the shop on a boat? Some of the parts are very difficult to get in view of the camera.  I'd love to see more detailed engines, some cut scenes would be nice, a project car for your mechanic to work on on the side would be cool. High performance parts.. Engine noise troubleshooting with actual sound clips would be really neat.   Overall it's a pretty great game. Well worth the 15-20 bucks.",

This game is not need for speed, you do not upgrade cars or make them faster. It's simply a game where you repair customers cars. If you ever played gear head garage and liked it you will like this game.   The game can get old pretty quick, it becomes a puzzle sometimes repairing cars but that's what happens in real life to a mechanic.   The test track is useless and doesn't offer any real way of trouble shooting what's wrong with a car. If the clutch is bad the car still drives fine etc.  The career mode is repetitive and towards the end offers nothing except the enjoyment of fixing cars. They have only two different motors so far and I'm towards the end. You only replace basic parts on the car. Nothing internal in the engine itself just external stuff.   The game is simple and if you do not know much about cars you could kinda learn the basics from this game. I recommend this if your a car/motor enthusiast but if your looking for something on the lines of NFS stay away.",

I don't think it's meant to be...otherwise we could use this as the first step in a Mechanics qualification. (Which would be cool by the way!)  I like to think of it as a puzzle game. I mean, what is being a mechanic, if it's not a puzzle? You have to find out what's wrong and fix it. Same thing here. Except, it doesn't overwhelm the player with all the aspects of being a mechanic.  I would've liked a bit more of a tutorial, especially when you get your new garages, as when I got the 3rd garage, it asked me to do a chip tuning. I had no idea what this meant. Just looking around, I found a new door...went in, and then haphazardly clicked on things, until it worked. Yeah, there's a little 'guide' in the chip tuning, but it doesn't tell you much.  It might get repetitive...but, think about it. If you're a proper mechanic, surely you've done the same things over and over...so it does give you a sense of what it's like in that respect.  The only downside...is the test track. On the repair orders, it could say 'There's a horrid noise when I change gear', or 'When I go faster, there's this whining from the rear of my car.' Well...there isn't. When you get one of those jobs, and go out in the car...you expect to hear what the client is talking about...but you don't. That would've been a great thing...to hear and feel the car handling differently, based on what was wrong. But, it seems that the test track, and even the path test indoors, are just formalities, with no real indication to you, the player, as to what's wrong. It's just a way to automatically highlight problems when you're examining the car. It would've been so much nicer, and realistic, if these problems were actually in the test track area...  The only one that is reflected in the test track...is when the problem is, that the car wont even start. At least that one's there...lol.  This is a Car Mechanic simulator, as much as Farming Simulator is a simulator for farming. It's got the basics, and honestly, if they added more, it could be so much better. The framework is there...  I enjoy this game, and I can see myself playing for a long time. Especially if they let the modding community at it.",

It is for the mechanics/car interested teen/adult. It was perfect for me because I only knew a little about car mechanics and now I have learned a lot.   The game is quite small but the game play part of troubleshooting and using diagnostic tools is nice. The description say 'Deal with customers' but the only part I have seen is an order report, so I never actually saw any customers or had dialogue with them. That also makes it hard to know what customers actually want fixed. Eg. 'Replace all damaged parts' does that mean you want everything less than 100% condition repaired or is 90+% okay? You can't finish the order until the customer is 100% satisfied but you cant ask them what's missing.",

            "review_text": "Fairly decent simulator game where you role play a mechanic fixing issues with cars. Clients come in with requests ranging from checking tire pressure to full on engine block replacements or undercarriage repairs. It kinda works as a puzzle game, in that you need to know what is required to be done and what parts need removing to get to the parts needing a fix. Knowing this saves you time labouriously taking every removable piece of the car out.  Outside of the garage, you may be asked to test out how a car handles after you've done repairs. You get to drive the car in either third person or in-car view around a short test track. Controls are very basic but functional at least in getting the job done.  It really is nothing that special, but there isn't inherently wrong with it. It looks semi-decent, gameplay is relatively relaxing, there isn't any time limit pressure on completing objectives. I recommend doing it while listening to music or the radio. It's really one of those games that passes the time, nothing more.  Overall, it's just another basic simulator game, so easy to make as all you need to do is think of a mundane job/task and build a game around that. A load of them are an absolute joke (with Goat Simulator being the ultimate simulator joke - I think that was made to purely mock the banality of the genre). It's relatively fine gameplay-wise and at the end of the day, that's really all that matters. It also has a slight puzzle element to it as to try to locate the problem with a client's car and fix it. So I'd tentatively recommend it, even though the oversaturation of these mundane simulators is getting pretty ridiculous on Steam these days.",

The camera is kind of clunky, but once you get the zoom and pan down, you will be ripping through these. Definitely need to do all of the testing (OBDII, track, and brake/suspension) to make life easier than pulling everything off and redoing it. The game can be completed without doing the bank loan, and frankly I didnt see the 'sell inventory' button until I was playing the DLC (eyefinity moved it to the third monitor). A great non-violent alternative to some games that are out today, and a a great time waster. Thoroughly enjoyed.",

            "review_text": "The idea is good, very good, but way to far to be called a simulator... The most simplest job in the game is changeing brake pads on a disc brake system. In the game all you do is... 1. take the wheel off 2. take the caliper off 3. remove the pads from the brake rotor 4. Replace the old pads with new pads 5. Reinstall the Caliper 6. Put the wheel back on. In real life this is the basics, but so far from the actual thing, its great for the casual gamer who dosen't know anything about cars, but when you do this stuff for a living its somewhat silly and mundane. If your wondering how many steps their actually is to replace the brake pads in real life... 1. Break all lugs on wheels 2. Jack car up 3. Remove all wheels 4. Disconnect all brake lines from calipers and allow time to bleed off. 5. Remove calipers 6. Remove brake pads from Caliper 7. Compress cylinder within Caliper to allow new Pads to fit 8. Install new pads to fit 9. Reinstall all Calipers with Pads 10. Not a bad idea to check the rotors as well, Replace if worn or galded 11. Reconnect brake lines to all Calipers 12. In respect to the posistion of the Master Cylinder start from the farthest corner and work inwards bleeding the calipers to fit, make sure no air is in the lines. 13. When bleeding your Brake system pump your brake pedal and depress on the third pump, while another person cracks the bleeder on the caliper, repeat until clear fluid is coming out. 14. Frequently check the Master Cylinder to ensure it is not empty when you are bleeding the brake system. 15. If everything checks out, put your wheels back on and torque them to their respective torque rateing. But in all honesty, if the game did this i would be impressed, and probably not want to play, that sounds like a lot of work. There are also some things that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off, like stupid ♥♥♥♥ that your best position to remove a starter is from the top of the engine compartment, and rubber bushings just slide out, and even the fact that everything you do is by hand with a wrench. Not going to lie, i like this game, i suggest you buy it if you wanna get some general car knowledge, but this thing is far from a simulator.",

A few times I was caught trying to figure out what obscure detail I had missed. Also make sure to use all the tests to your disposal (OBD, diagnostic path, test course), makes it easier to identify parts that are worn out.

The graphics are very clean, and the way the game colors parts of the car allows for me to easily identify different components.

And I have to give Gearhead Garage props, that game sucked me in for hours when I was younger. It was incredibly simple, and can probably be easily converted to a flash game at this point.  So you can imagine my elation when I saw this game. Since it was indie, I didn't want to pay full price. I've been burned by too many boring, broken, or incomplete indie games in the past on Steam. I can say, knowing what I know now, I would definitely pay full price for it.  At this point I am addicted to it. For me, that is being stuck at work, and looking forward to getting home and playing th is game to unwind. I usually play for an hour or so at a time (I'm a casual gamer). That's pretty rare for me, only other games to do this are bigger hits like GTA V or The Last of Us.  I'm a huge car nut, so I very much enjoy this game. I've tinkered in real life. Granted, the game completely simplifies all the repairs, but it's still satisfying and doesn't feel mundane or boring.  I also really like the fact that you can 'learn' things such as increasing profits, reducing parts prices in the catalog, or increasing the speed of removing bolts.  Each scenario feels like a puzzle, and a few times I've been stumped and had to look something up online. If you have any automotive experience, some of the jobs are easier for you to tackle, since you've probably experienced it in real life; e.g. tires are wearing out fast (suspension), car shuts of randomly (fuel pump), etc. If you don't have experience, you will probably learn a thing or two, that is pretty cool.  As far as graphics/sound/controls. The graphics seem slightly unoptimized, FPS can dip down once you're in the shop, but the graphics don't look incredibly detailed. Sounds are average, nothing amazing there. Controls aren't too bad, the camera can be annoying sometimes with how it zooms. But after a while you'll get to a point where you're flying through all the interactions and whatnot, so it's easy to get the hang and feel of.  If you're a car nut like me, and have actually worked on cars before, this can be a fun romp for you. I'd definitely recommend trying this game out, it is well polished, and well executed.

The game was crude but had a huge mod group where people made real cars for the game to fix up and sell.  That game prompted me to purchase this game and I have to say as a real auto/truck tech the game is very much like real life. Every symptom I have seen from the customer was correct to the causes.  How ever there is one thing that really bugs me. The game requires removal of items to get to another item that you really dont have to do in real life. Example is there was one job that required the replacement of the exhaust manifold. To do this you have to remove the rear muffler, the rear exhaust pipe, the middle muffler, the middle exhaust pipe, the catalytic converter, and the forward exhaust pipe before you can remove the exhaust manifold.  When I have had to do this at work I have never removed the whole exhaust system, I have always broke the exhaust loose at the manifold to header pipe connection and then removed the manifold.  This is where this game in my opinion could be improved on is allowing the items to be removed without having to remove the whole system when it is not required. Its like removal of the front strut you have to take the sway bar end link off first. Well I dont remove them I remove the end that is attached to the strut and then remove the strut. Like wise in the game the strut only has four bolts holding it to the spindle arm when in reality its two bolts with another three to six bolts holding it to the unibody at the top of the strut.  While these complaints are minor and do not effect the game itself I still recommend the game for those that want to experience real diaganostics and troubleshooting of vehicle problems.",

With that in mind, onto the review. *  Graphics: 1 Point = Yes, graphics were decent, but could have been slightly better. Music/Sound: 1 Point = Yes, though the music could have added more tracks to seem less repititive. Gameplay: 1 Point = Functions well, felt very natural from the very start. Genre: 1 Point = Tis advertised as a Car Mechanic Simulator, and in many degrees it achieves such. Overall: 1 Point = It's very fun, HOWEVER, latter levels seem more of a chore. Total: 5/5  My first impresions of the game were quite fond, everything was new, and I had to figure out, A) What was wrong with the car, and B) How to get it out, and replace it. For some levels, it took me a few trys, like figuring out where the spark plugs were and how to get to them. Mostly, it was pretty easy once you get the flow of things in the game. Replacing parts I've never replaced earlier felt exciting. Rear Axel here, 4 wheel drive there, replace muffler ect.  It wasn't long before I mastered this game and quickly was gaining cash. It's here were fun started to turn into a bit of a chore. Everything was too easy towards the latter levels of the game. I knew how to do everything and beat all 75 levels within 2 days. I even replaced one cars whole parts just to stop the game from being mundane. To say there isn't enough to do is an understatement, while the early stages are fun, there really isn't much stopping you from plowing through this game. Latter stages are repitive, but are still fun in their own right.  I'd still recommend this title, and see that it has potential, however, I think you should wait till the DLC and content updates come for this game before buying. It's a good game, just not as good as you may hope.",

            "review_text": "This game is NOT like Gear Head Garage if anyone reamembers that game. But it is a lot of fun. But it does certainly has room for improvement. But I higlhly recommend playing the DEMO first before blindly purchasing it based on players reviews.   I sort went into this game thinking cool another Gear Head Garage game, but sadly it is not that in any shape or form. First off you are given jobs, and given a certain amount of how much the job cost. It is up to you to pin point the problem based on what the customer said or by test driving, or doing a test tech in bigger garages.   One thing I learned while playing is the vehicle will have a lot of red parts, but you won't have enough money to buy/fix them all, just buy/fix what the person wanted and send it on its way. Buying/Fixing the red parts will put your shop in a early grave, so while tempting. Just DON'T do it.  One job that really threw people off was the fuel filter job. While having replaced the fuel filter in my car recently. I knew it was in or near the gas tank, so I went there right away. But other's stumbled on this job for a long time.   Now I said this game has much needed improvements.  Like jobs, they need to be rewarding or graded on how well you did also if you missed something major.   They should of done a story line or something to make the game interesting, but there really isn't any voices. And if you shut music off it's really really really quiet. Other than the occasional sound of the nuts coming off  Also the ability to just build a vehicle from the ground up and they paint it cool and sell it. While this isn't technically what mechanic does, this game based on the jobs, isn't technically what a mechanic does either, I never been to a shop where the customer pays for the job first, unless it's routine maintenance. With that being said it should have the option of adding parts in case there is a bigger problem than originially thought.  Also there needs to be more parts. Able to fix more parts. More second hand parts,, in much better condition. Since most of those parts are bit of a rip off. Also the parts cost a lot. I mean A LOT. Oil Filter costing 50 bucks.  The camera angle is something to be desired. especially in the back of the vehicle. I had a hard time viewing the vehicle. Sometimes the WASD buttons would reverse.    How do you get to bigger badder garages, by doing jobs, that is how. I am not sure how long I played but didn't seem like very long and I got my 2nd garage pretty fast.   Changing oil is pretty routine. But changing oil in the 2nd garage is odd. You have put it in this catch oil pan and you have be very percise where it is or you lose 100 dollars. The first garage wasn't like that you just drained the oil and that was that. Just seems to be a step back, instead of a step forward. And in the 2nd garage for sure, why can't you now fix tires? One of the tires in the game cost either 1600 or 1700 for one tire, I could see if it was all 4 tires. But this is just one tire. Jobs don't pay a lot, so replcaining one tire is really expensive.   On the plus side of things there is going to be FREE DLC. So perhaps some improvements in game play as well more things to do. While I do reommend this game. I really recommend playing the DEMO first.   Here is hoping the Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 is taking the ideas of the fans and making EVEN better than the original.",

Yes, it's not 100% accurate, but it will give you a pretty good general idea. The mechanics (pun not intended) of the game are pretty simple, you have to find the broken part and replace it. Very simple idea, but it can be quite fun and relaxing, and netting you some car mechanic knowledge in the meantime.   There is nothing competitive here, you will not be judged or measured against others, so you can just chill out and fix those cars.",

The only downfall is the repetative gameplay itself but it's still engaging and pushes you on to complete the order, and the next, and the next.  Personally I wish there was more depth, like being able to actually delve into the engine, or replace U-Joints and smaller stuff.

The turbo dlc should make things more interesting if you can set psi and add boost controllers and such. I think what would make it perfect for me would be customers asking for performance mods.

If you know a little about cars and like to tinker is it good fun and easy to diagnose and repair the cars.   Real car mechanics / enthusiasts shouldn't expect much in the way of accuracy or simulation. Some things are a little strange like when you take a brake caliper off and the pads are still there floating beside the rotor, or how you have to take apart an entire air intake all the way to the throttle body just to replace an air filter.  But, it still is a good time waster.  The test drive mode should have either been not included or it needs to be upgraded, badly. Every car drives the same no matter what the issue. I even took a car for a test drive that supposedly wouldn't start! Ok.. sure if you listen you can hear the brakes squeak on some cars but that is the only difference i have ever heard so far. The test driving just feels like a chore and the element of fun has worn off by the third or fourth time you have to do one.  All in all, I'll play though it. I'm around 4 hours in and about 1/3 completed with the career.  Final Thoughts: It's hard to call this a game. There isn't a lot of game aspects to it. If you like to teardown stuff and put it back together, this is a good diversion for what it is. The graphics are good, but I can hear my vid card run like it has never ran before, which sort of tells me that it could be optimized a little better. There are only a handful of cars and most of the time it will not matter which car it is because they all share most of the same components, so when you are tearing them down, there isn't much different between the cars.  I know that is a lot of cons, but I still enjoy playing it.. It reminds me of when I was a child and wanted to take apart all of my own toy cars. For that alone I will give it an 8/10",

There is a nice touch of discovery on some of the missions, like 'My car won't start! Please fix!' but the missions end up being a lot like one another, which for me is a drawback. There is not enough complexity to keep things running for too long.  Now, the major and most disappointing thing: the 1/4 mile Add on. I was hoping to get some real nice parts, to be able to exchange pistons and crankshafts, play with gear rations and stuff, but it ended up as a simplistic 'this part gives 8% power' and you just change it as it was done on the 'fix it' part of the game. Ok, small 'click until right' tunning session and finish.  Like I said in the beggining, if you like mechanics and can buy it cheap, do it. It will entertain you for about 4hs.",

Yes the fact that you could drive the cars to diagnose them would have been a nice touch if it didnt feel like I was driving a maxed out clown car propelled by rubber bands with suspension made out of matches.   The worst part is that I dont seem to get to buy my own car, fixing it up and trying to turn a profit but rather grind my way through repetetive tasks with a bunch of whiny women who are not able to change their oil or even their own air filter.",

Exhaust manifolds which bolt to the engine block rather then the head and which cant be removed without disassembling the entire exhaust system first. Front engined RWD cars with transversely mounted engines. Brake systems with no master cylinder and induction systems with no injectors or throttle body. Suspension arms that bolt rigidly to the spindles with no ball joints. Batteries and suspension arms that can be rebuilt at a workbench (just let me get my hammer...). The list goes on. So a cute idea, but they should have perhaps involved an actual mechanic. I'm still kind of curious about the sequel but I won't be paying full price for it.",

Taking the intake mainfold off is just one click, but i have to wrench 4 bolts out of the airbox? Able to remove the fuel filter, which was located betweeen the fuel tank and body of the car, without removing the tank?  I realize that if the game were too in depth it would be too hard and boring for most people. But i think a happy medium is needed and this is far from it. Neglects to mention simple things that people should know like lug pattern tightening. Guy says needs air, oil, fuel filter changes... changing the oil filter but not the oil? When you need new parts for a car, no looking up making sure you get the right parts, all parts fit every single car. Spare parts laying around fit every car. Hit it with a hammer, brand new again.  I paid $1.69 for this game and im not even gonna request a refund since i got 54 minutes time waste outta it. Still i dont think its worth paying money to play. In fact even if they offered me money to play it i would still probably decline.  ",

I wanted to be able to select car jacks and measure nut and bolt sizes. I wanted to be able to tighten bolts to specifications. I wanted to be able to shop for different brands of brake pads and purchase brake pads for specific cars. 50 dollars for one brake pad is so unrealistic.   The game looks nice and was quick to setup.

Graphics and sound are good enough, but the interface is very lacking.  Main problem: the way way camera/mouse behaves. It's hard to describe, but you have to move the mouse VERY carefully or you end up swaggering - every time you move the mouse, the camera moves too.  Another problem is the game doesn't really help you - I'm no mechanic. I have no idea where the fuel filter might be (somewhere near the gas tank, I'd assume?). Unfortunately, the game doesn't even indicate where the item in question might be, unless you're already very close. (Case in point, until you think of lifting the car, you don't even know there's another place to tinker UNDER the car. All other options are constantly shown (hood, wheels, side door), but not the one below the car, even if it's directly part of your current job?
