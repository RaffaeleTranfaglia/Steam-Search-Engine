The developers are constantly updating the game, and adding content or touching balance every week, proving they love their creation.  For those who didn't read my review on the first game, this one also plays a lot like a Warhammer game, there are no hexagons, you move according to the distance each unit can move. The units you take with you to the battle gain experience and when they level up, get new skills.  The game is cheap as is, so I didn't mind paying the full price. It's worth it. You get two full campaigns with lots of units and abilities to try, in a hard game. :)  If you like tactical games, this one is (same as the first one) one of the best there are this days around. :)",

Despite its depth, Age of Fear has a perfectly intuitive interface that makes learning the ropes a simple endeavor. The turn structure and combat mechanics make sense immediately, and the joy of leveling your troops and upgrading their skills remains engaging throughout the campaigns. Though a little too pricey, the fact is that this is a very solid title for anyone that likes strategy games set in a fantasy universe.",

The stories have a nice kind of grit to it, making the right decisions in skirmishes does pay off, and there's a great variety of units considering the length of the campaigns.  TBH the price point is a bit high, but if you're an old school lover of the genre this is a good pick.",

I got through the 1st mission (tutorial) with just one freeze. After that the game froze on me again and loading autosaves just doesn't work. Loading savegames just freezes the game.  Really, the linux/steamos -version needs some work. But guess I'll give it a go on a win10.",
