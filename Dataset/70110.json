It definately isn't in the same class as Uplink but there really isn't anything out that is. Hacking Simulation is a very underutilized genre. But if you've already played through Uplink and are liking for a good second choice this is it.",

The game melds the basic concepts of hacking/cracking with an intuitive interface to give players a sense of actually working through systems to progress through each level. It manages to hold the player's attention for more than a single playthough, compelling them to retrace their steps in order to leave no stone unturned and no node left untouched.",

However some of my biggest compaints about this game was how short it is and the end level is nearly impossible to beat while its nice to have a challenge it doesn't even progress you into it. I hope some day that this game gets the workshop so people can really drive home the mods and content this game is missing but I fear that day may never come. If you were a fan of uplink then you will enjoy this game even though its so short. Well worth grabbing at a lower price if you can and want to try it. Who knows maybe some day we will get that workshop we all want so we can make more of a story line and options for this game we all really want.",

While Hacker Evolution – Untold’s story is a lot more relatable, it was also quite boring. The scenarios were much more realistic and as a result feel less grand than the first one. The ending was just flat out ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on many levels, absolutely terrible closure. The levels feel way overdrawn for no reason whatsoever, and by the end it just feels like you are doing chores rather than playing a puzzle game. You can tell the developers were running out of creative ideas for running a hacking simulation game. Overall this game is a poor sequel to the first.",
