            "review_text": "There isn't much to say except that if you like the 'Warriors'/musou game series, this would be a great addition to your library. Although I should say this, you  must  be a fan of the series or else you won't get the full experience out of it, you might as well be playing dynasty warriors.  The gameplay is very similar to the dynasty series, borderline copy and paste almost...But with some variation to make it not such a direct copy. You find cards on the battlefield after defeating certain enemies, completing objectives, or finishing a level. These cards give you passive buffs such as increased power, defense, musou/special gauge attributes, increased health, etc... In order of increasing rarity you have C, B, A, (possibly S as well, I will change this once if I find one). As you go up in rarity you get more passives per card. There is a mini card crafting menu that lets you combine (10) cards to create a new one. What I did enjoy though is the mount combat, I haven't played a dynasty game where you kind of want to fight on your horse. You can actually pull of combos, which I find is a very nice touch.  Weapons, you can carry two at a time and can swtich between them in combat. The weapons work in such a way that as you keep using your selected weapon and defeat enemies it will get stronger by recieveing elemental effects and increased combos. And you can get different weapons which have different elemental properties, there are 4 in total.  The story mode follows the current season 1 anime very closely, so if you haven't finished watching then I would suggest to avoid this game if you don't want any spoilers. Progression through the story is seamless it goes: Battle -&gt; story cutscene -&gt; battle -&gt; story cutscene -&gt; battle and repeat. There is no pause in between to equip cards or weapons, it is all done in the menu during the battle phase.  The game is quite linear. You are free to move around and kill enemies, but eventually you have to complete a certain objective to advance. The stages are broken up in segments, so continuing with my explanation, you have to do/complete certain objective to advance to the next segment. You cannot proceed if you don't complete it.  Then of course you have all the different characters you can play, each having their own skillset and weapon of choice.  I should also mention that there is online-coop, I personally haven't tried it yet, maybe a bit down the road. But it is there for those that want to jump into online play right away.  Graphics, I feel are very nice, the whole anime-style drawing of characters with the 3D-ish backgrounds. You have many graphic options in the menu that you can mess around, which I feel is very nice for those that do like to change their graphical settings. I'm not so great with the terminology with these settings, I just set it to whatever they give me, but I will say the visuals are very pleasing to my eye.  From a hours:money stand point. I feel it is a bit overpriced, you're pretty much paying for the anime name, which I don't see it being justifiable of a 60$ USD price tag, this feels more like a 30-40$ game. So you must like the anime and the gameplay to almost justify this purchase.  Overall this is great game, a solid 'warriors' type of game. And one last time, I can't stress this enough though, you must like the anime in order to get the full enjoyment out of this game, else the game will be mediocre to you. I hope this review helps you decide in purchasing this game or not.   *edit* 2/18/2016: So after putting some hours into the game, I would like to change my opinion a little bit about needing to like the anime before purchasing this game. The gameplay is actually really fun. After spending some time and unlocking new weapon combos, they look and feel really cool. The combos feel really unique and fit the characters really well, which I really enjoyed.  With that said, I feel that if you do like Musou kind of games, you can definitely enjoy this game without having to watch the anime. As for price I still stand by my review in that it is a bit overpriced. BUT if you do have some extra cash to spare, then by all means purchase this game, it is worth it.",

            "review_text": "ARSLAN: THE WARRIORS OF LEGEND is an amazing game. It's more than I expected! I never heard of the source material until I saw this game, and as a fan of Dynasty Warriors, and somebody who recently got into Berserk, the pictures made reminded me of Berserk's cast so I was like, 'I'mma buy it. Can't be any worse than other KOEI games.' And then it was ♥♥♥♥ing amazing.  9/10 Pros: *Great Combat System *Great Soundtrack *Great World, Lore, Story, and Characters *Some sweet new mechanics in a Warriors game  Cons: Nothing of note. Other's have complained of performance issues, but I've had none, so eh. ------------------------------------  While they can't take credit for creating the world, or creating the main story, they can take credit for telling the story well. The game itself is gorgeous, with fantastic gameplay to boot, and on top of that the world is amazing. Even if you never heard of it like me, it's easy to get yourself immersed into and wanting to know more about it, and the story told is good enough to keep you informed on everything you need to know. The cast and voice acting are all amazing, (all Japenese though, only English Subtitles), and really bring out the character's even more than just their unique looks and combat styles.  The story itself is strong and gripping, and the way they tell it is great. There's of course the amazing big battles with plot happening on the field, but there's also the superb animations in between each stage of battle that further the story. It's fun to watch and feels like you're watching a show, getting lost in it's story and cast. The gameplay is like other Warriors games - lot of slashing and hacking. But, they do add some cool features - shields on bosses, stuns, dodges and unique abilities seperate from a special attack (musou attack). There's also special events on the field of battle, that let you charge with cavarly or infantry, leading destruction in a glorious blaze, or fire volley of arrows with archers. It's a fun game with a nice unique twist and mix put into the Warriors franchise, telling the badass story of Arslan.",

            "review_text": "Can't recommend.  This is basically Dynasty Warriors wrapped in a fantasy anime-ish story. Story is pretty run-of-the-mill, and cuts abruptly. with a random cliffhanger Technical issues are numerous and varied. Gameplay is rather dull and repetitive (although enough of a mindless fun to keep you occupied for 7 to 10 hours).  Overall, unless you're a fan of Dynasty Warriors type games, or possibly Arslan Senki novels/manga/anime, pass on this one, it's likely not worth your time.",

I ran it with 980ti in SLi and achieved only 30 fps in 4k and it looked like a 10 year old game. The frame rate is all over the place. Also they never seem to patch their games so your stuck with this. I fortunately refunded mine as £45 is a joke for this rubbish.",
