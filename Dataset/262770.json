But it's way too short (beat it in roughly an hour) some sections of the game the frame rate drops and is horribly annoying.  Like I said, it's not a bad game at all, but to me it's overpriced for how short the overall game is.",

            "review_text": "Indie down-scrolling platformer with a delightfully deviant sense of humor. Worth it just for the princess' dark wit.  The game is fairly short and suits casual players (normal difficulty) and more experienced gamers (hard mode) especially if you try for the Freerunner achievement without buying the glider, wings or hoverboard.  There is some replayability with more than one ending, a Par for each level in number of deaths, time taken, and currency collected, and the Steam achievements. It's also fun to play through it again just to re-read the princess' messages; you might find a couple that you overlooked the first time.  You should expect to die a lot at first, but this is part of the fun. 'Make them like this' will be your motto.",

I'm not overly bothered with that so for me it was a nice way to pass some time.   It's not overly hard or frustrating, quite forgiving and the good part is: you actually get the choice to do a harder route if you want to. Excellent for when you start to get frustrated so you can just take the easier route.  The story is rather funny with a crazy but fun princess that will torment you with her writings and castle design.  Give it a go when you feel like a platformer that is not designed to just punish you all the time, but still offers some challenges.",

It's like Super MeatBoy platformer/parkour, with the exit at the bottom of the stage  But it's too short, took about 1 hour 30 mins to beat. You can time attack the stages and there are other endings I guess, but I'm not sure those are enough to carry it.  Get it if it goes on sale!",

            "review_text": "Freedom Fall has a great premise that lets you get right into the action. You're trapped in an enormous prison tower and need to work your way down to escape while avoiding all manner of traps and dangers. Along the way, you are taunted by very amusing taunts scrawled on the wall by your captor, a deranged princess.   The game controls wonderfully, and is extremely responsive. You can optionally get a few upgrades as you proceed, a double jump, glide, and a more controllable glide. And you can throw bombs to get past traps and barricades. They keep it simple, along the lines of an NES or SNES era title so you can play without being bogged down by the control scheme or number of options. The graphics are quite attractive as well, although perhaps more variety would have been nice.   The game is a bit on the short side, but for completionists, you can get a few different endings, play on a hard mode, and collect some in depth achievements. Definitely a pleasant surprise of a game.",

Taking on an unconventional approach to the tired platformer, Freedom Fall is a nice take on the genre with nice artwork, simple mechanics and a slightly dark sense of humour. You play the part of a prisoner making a bid for Freedom but like any good game, one does not simply walk out the front door. A local developer producing good looking and good playing arcade style gaming that still for me falls into the family area that only *just* nudges towards the PG rating (animated blood, bones etc. - nothing that I would call disturbing for an 8 year old.) Nice work guys.",

However, The game's shortness and easiness make it not worthy of its price, the killing blow however is that you can't play as the loveable loli princess. 4/10",

        {
            "review_text": "A really cool 'backwards' platform in which you must fall down levels instead of climbing them to proceed (even though there's still much jumping around involved). As an escaping prisoner, your objective is to reach the bottom of every level whilst circumventing contraptions of any sort. You can collect various screws and cogs which can then be used with workbenches to buy bombs (used to detonate traps or specific bricks) or power-ups to ease our quest. A series of check-points ensure that our premature death will not spell a restart from the beginning of the stage, even though, as a couple of achievements require us to not die at all during our run, an option to disable said check-points would have been useful.  The story is simple but told in a captivating way: as our hero is a rather taciturn one, his story can be recollected from the countless taunts that the evil princess who built this infamous tower enjoy writing on the background walls. The messages' childish and sadistic nature had me giggling and cringing at the same time very often, and were a further incentive to complete my mission and see how everything would wrap up in the end.  Graphics and music are reminiscent of the golden age of 16-bit arcade titles, coated in a shiny HD presentation, while level design is a perfect mix of mnemonic knowledge and just the right space for improvisation. Once the main game ends, there's still some challenge in the form of completing stages on par with time, cogs gathered and number of deaths: unfortunately, those parameters are not displayed during your run, so you don't know how good (or bad) it is going until you manage to reach the exit. That would have been a remarkable addition, too.  All in all, I enjoyed my time with Freedom Fall and will try to snatch those challenging speedrun achievements. I'll surely keep tabs on any future Stirfire Studios' projects!",

The controls are fairly tight and mechanics are sound. The game is a bit short on content though. But the place it really shines is the story and characters, both represented entirely from the scribbles on the walls as you progress through each level. Game devs take note: this is an excellent example of how to mix story/character development along with enticing the player through the level.  EDIT: I MUST mention that I got this as part of a bundle, so it basically cost me 50 cents. At that price this is a no-brainer. However, at $10 it is a bit steep, ONLY due to the short length. Wait for a sale, and then grab this one.",
