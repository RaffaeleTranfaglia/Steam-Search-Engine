Monthly Updates with new items for all kinds of things, and new events every update.  I find this game Very Cute, Attractive and also has a Lovely Community. So I recommend u to download it and give it a try. (Leveling up takes awhile) (Little Hard for the beginniers when starting, so make sure to practice off with 1-2 stars, 60-90 BPM)",

            "review_text": "Short Version: It's just a silly rhythm game from Korea where you can dress up as a cat, have a fox tail or nine, and dance with strangers to a very High School Musical vibe. It's a fine little game. Everyone is judging it rather harshly for being a little too foreign.   As a rhythm game it is actually fairly good. The important thing to know is that when it shows Left and Down in a single block it doesn't mean push them at the same time but instead in that order as half notes. The complaints about clothing not being permanent is a trivial one as you get the currency to 'rent' these both by events and daily logins.. there are also clothes you can rent with the in game currency they toss at you after each match.   Throw in the social aspect of playing with random strangers from all over the world (who seem to average between 12 and 20) and some of the strange game modes that let you couple up regardless of gender and dance together ending in an awkward kiss or the mode that pairs up male and female avatars to 'propose' ending with each player picking one of the males or females and adding extra in game currency and becoming friends if you match up with each other.

            "review_text": "The graphics aren't high quality but I like the style of them. 3 avatar types per gender. (Careful, you can not change gender once selected) The wardrobe is limited and you have to pay more to actually keep the clothing you get for your character. A lot of which costs cash, not the 'in game free currency'. I do like that there is a wide variety of songs in various languages and music genres. It's nice to hear music you have have never been exposed to before. I haven't seen other people mention this in the reviews but this game constantly drops connection for me (And a few other people I know who play). It usually happens in the middle of playing a song which can get frustrating. None of my other games do this. It is just this game. This is the biggest concern for me as far as game quality. If I want to play a game, I want to play it, not keep reloading it because it's dropped connection on me.  Overall I like the game, it's cute. Though I am not over the moon about it as there are quite a few things that could very well be improved upon.",

Or Fruity girls. Trash talk them and make them cry for 5 mins before the game starts.  Dance dance dance.  Get 20.000 points when the kids get well over a million.  Get all your grown up friends to get the game.  Make a dance squad.  Have a good one hour laugh.  Play no other game, ever ever ever.",

The only thing reaaaally lacking is graphics options and the technical side overall.  Windowed Mode recommended , else the game looks like ♥♥♥♥. Native controller support would’ve been nice as well, I ♥♥♥♥ing suck at rhythm games that are Keyboard only.",

The other down part how you play with other people that are like GODS at the game and u are just like a newbie, i reckon they just should've made something called 'Servers'. For example Rookie server lvl1 to lvl3 then so on... you should know what im getting at.
