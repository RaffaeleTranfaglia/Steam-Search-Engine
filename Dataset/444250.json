Honestly, not that big of a deal but I can see how it may frustrate some people. My biggest problem with this game is the AI is not that intelligent. Once you understand how the game works it becomes mindlessly easy. The AI tends to spend a lot of money on buildings while you are sweeping up huge swaths of land, at which point you have large amounts of money coming in and you can quickly dominate the board. The AI also tends to focus on small border enemies and completely ignores you while you build a massive empire. There seems to be some kind of animosity mechanic in the game where if you don't attack another player, they will generally leave you alone until they have to attack you because you're the only one left, or there is no other way for them to expand. I have found that, generally, it is best to just ignore building anything and focus on grabbing as much land as possible. Then use your increased income to crush your enemies. Several people have said this game is like Risk. Anyone saying that has never played Risk before. This game has little in common with Risk.  Basically a fun little game to play around with but it gets old fairly fast.",

Similiar turn-based strategy to the RISK board games, and Civilization V.  Cons:  - The game is confined to a square window that cannot be fullscreened or put into 16:9. (This will likely be changed, I can respect the square design as it seems to be stylistic, but I'd love fullscreen capabilities.)

Capturing a territory is a random chance, so you can even fail to capture unguarded territory. There are also RNG plagues and rebellions.

As soon as I got a foothold, I immediately lost it, and was back to square one. Because the game is so simple, especially on that particular map, winning is almost completely random because there isn't any real way to play more skillfully than the computer. At least in the first couple levels, when there aren't that many different units to use, I figure the game needs to give the player an edge so they can actually win at some point and go on to something more complicated that is actually challenging instead of based completely on chance.

The only advantage having a multitude of provinces is you get more attempts at attacking, however unlike games such as Risk where you can stack your numbers advantage.   This game provides what appears to be a 50% win/loss ratio. Having a fortress built seems the only way to enhance your defence, but again the benefit/penalty is unseen and appears to be a 30% win/loss ratio (attacker).
