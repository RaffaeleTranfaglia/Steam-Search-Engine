            "review_text": "Let me be honest, I wanted to enjoy this game. I really did. I wanted it to be good, because as a fan of dating sim and otome games, I am painfully aware of the fact there is not a lot of varity in those kinds of games available outside of Japan. It's mostly indies or ported games so the attitude towards these games is mostly, 'Take what you can get and be grateful.'  This game though, I'm not impressed with. I played for two straight hours and I just feel dirty because of it. To be fair though, the music and art design are very impressive. It looks and sounds very well done and I'd give it top marks on that alone if it weren't for my beef with it.  The writing and the characters are awful. I mean, completely awful. The lowdown is this. There's a redlight district on an island you're tasked with making a delivery to and on the way you help a couple trying to escape because men on this island are effectively slaves. Uh... okay, and I'm going to try to be romanced by one? Way to make me feel creeped out right off the bat. Anyway, you help them escape so he can get married and in return you come into some money and fancy clothing. You're actually there to make a delivery and so when you go to the place in question, you immediately meet (most of) your romance options.  These guys are creeps, like almost every single one of them. Playing this I got grabbed, felt up, talked down to and forced to drink alcohol AGAINST MY WILL MIND YOU! I was compared to a piece of meat, and the owner, the OWNER himself told me I needed to be pretty and more receptive in order to 'earn a man's seed'. Seriously, what in the world?  Now, I'm not going to pretend I'm some expert on courtesans or this time period. While I've studied a little I'm sure there are plenty of people who know way more than me, but I know there is a difference between hooker and courtesans. You go to the nice places to be entertained, romanced and bedded. You go see a hooker to sleep with and be on your way in twenty minutes and probably treated poorly because they couldn't care less about entertaining you.  That's how I felt here. I felt like I'd stepped into a place where no one knew the first thing about how to treat a lady. More than that, of course the female character has to be this shy little waif who will just take this appalling treatment. The, 'Uh... ah... I... um...' responces to everything happening to here was so cliche, along with the, 'Even though I'm shy and uncomfortable with this, he's too alluring for me to fight against it.' Why did this have to be done? Why can't I just play a girl who WANTS to go to this place instead of being forced to stay by the owner? Why can't I pick a guy and make it rain for him? Why does this essentially have to be a story about a girl romanced against her will by a guy who is, again, a slave? Why when I do get a choice on how to act, (By the way I basically told the owner I didn't want to hear his vulgar bs about seed recieving. Seriously, what?) only to get laughed at and dismissed? Guys? Uh... I'm a customer here, both in and out of this game world. Is a little respect for the customer that much to ask for?  So in the end you play a girl who despite saying multiple times she doesn't want to be there and wants to leave, is forced to stay and pick one of the men there that insulted and grabbed at her without even knowing so much as her name, and she is too weak willed not to do anything but go along with it. Pick someone wrong and you get yelled at by the other workers there and made fun of, pick someone else and basically the exact same thing happens, and it all goes down hill from there. It all has this forced feeling to it, and honestly that's not what I want. I didn't get forced to buy this game. I bought it, sat down and played it because I wanted to.  Yet here's the intro. 'Your heart, body and womanhood are all on the line. You will never be able to escape. Not from the seductive wiles of the courtesans. No, let's be more accurate: From the pure love of the courtesans.' No... no I think the first statement was correct. It's wiles and it's not even seductive wiles at that. This whole thing of there being no men on the island feels cheap, as if this is the only reason the men can get away with acting like such jerks. 'Oh... well, women can't get the D anywhere else so they put up with these guys.' 'What about the men on the mainland who can get married and be happy with you and give you children and a family life? Clearly the rich women could afford it at least.' 'SHUSH! PLAY THE GAME, SCUM! DON'T YOU DARE BRING LOGIC IN HERE!' Except, yeah. Let's bring in logic because the second I stop to think all these things, the game isn't fun. It's lame, and more than that, it's insultive.  'You will never be able to escape.' Yeah, game. I can escape. I can get away from your jerk men and I can get away from your bs writing. It's called turning the game off and playing something else. Didn't think of that one, did you?  I know I'm in the minority here. I bought this game because it had such great reviews, but if you're one of the fans like me who actually wants the story to be somewhat decent, don't bother. This game will insult you, treat you awful and keep pounding home that garbage of you can't get away. Doesn't bother you, play it. It does bother you? Walk away and save your money.",

There are some typos once in awhile, the content has been quite M18 I would say. Haha. It definitely made me feel for the MC!  P/S: Been reading Takao's route only, and I really fell in love with Takao I must say! I hope there will be more better stuff to come. :D",

            "review_text": "I enjoyed this game.  I'm going to review on a general level and avoid huge spoilers here.  The first thing that stood out to me was the artwork. It's what drew me to this game in the first place. I think it's very nice and I like the style. I have no complaints about the art itself, but it's more about me pointing out inconsistencies: (1) Regarding the CG's, sometimes the heroine's eyes would show, and in others they don't. I know that it's a thing in visual novels, but usually games would have already decided with showing the main character's eyes most of the time or not in CG's. (2) The clothes of the person the heroine is talking to would change from time to time, but the dialogue makes no note of him changing clothes. Aside from that, the art seems soft, much like the heroine's personality.  Regarding the story, some routes were more interesting than others. Some routes showed more character development and relationship progression than others. It was a bit unrealistic to fall in love after a couple of days, but I did enjoy the stories for what they were. Personally, my favorite route was when I pursued a certain manager. It's nice that the game included a second story for him. On the other hand, the heroine's childhood friend does not appear in other routes, does not have any substories, and is not mentioned in any other route. I happen to like the childhood friend trope, so I was a bit disappointed with that. There were also some spelling errors (homophones) and awkward use of some words throughout the game. Like the use of 'comfit' in the game... I think it was referring to konpeito? Not a big deal, but the dialogue was a bit confusing at times.  Anyway, by the time I finished all the stories and the routes, I still wanted to read more. I don't regret the purchase, despite the things I pointed out. I fully enjoyed it and I liked all the characters.",

            "review_text": "A very solid experience!  The romanceable characters have distinct personalities and motives. The art is usually quite beautiful, although there are some wonky sprites and CGs, but nothing major, and the MC has eyes! Her personality is way better than I expected. Sure, she's an otoge MC, but the stereotypical elements of her personality are plot-related and she can actually be assertive. I fond the soundtrack quite pretty, although I suspect there are only 3 songs remixed. It's a port from mobile, so it's no deal breaker. The chapter format and UI and the narrative itself were clearly made with smartphones in mind. The narrative can't be super deep, but I found it engaging and the characters were diverse enough to make me enjoy each route. Sequels, Date Scenarios and Sub Scenarios are included as well with a handful of CGs from the Vita version. I'm a bit bummed that there are no voices nor the E-mote animations, but I can live without. The textboxes are prettier in this version, by the way. As a Voltage fan with a wallet freshly emptied by their sale I can't but recommend this game. There are actual sexy scenes in this game! The MC enjoys her time. You go, girl. This game also prompted me to look for the other Forbidden Romance games on the Play Store. Hope they'll port those too, I wouldn't mind paying full price for everything. I got Yoshiwara in the Steam Holiday Sale and I feel bad because I want to give more money to this company... I also got the mobile version and I'll gladly purchase extra stories and whatnot ;) My personal route preference from best to still enjoyable: Kagerou &gt; Tokiwa &gt; Kagura &gt; Takao &gt; Iroha &gt; Hayabusa",

I've been a big fan ever since its first release on iOS. The character art is great, the music is decent (it's pretty common for mobile otome not to have sounds) and the story is enjoyable.   My problem with this version is that when in fullscreen, the resolution drops A LOT! Suddenly everything goes into .jpeg mode :/ Everything's blurry and jaggy and the text is hard to read as well.  I hope this gets fixed in the future.  I'd still recommend this for those who want something different *and also because I'm a fangirl*(are there any other otome that are about literal man♥♥♥♥♥s?)",

Having an otome game where the heroine isn't stupid or the guys aren't forceful(there is a story reason why they are pushing on you in here) is hard task. And this game coasts to that goal.",

            "review_text": "Overall it's a good game, especially as far as limited availability of otome games go. It does have a unique spin in that the men are the prositutues and the women (possibly even some men [it isnt clear] too) are the customers. I like that this otome game pushes against these stereotypes regarding gender roles. It's definitely a step outside the normal boundaries and paramenters of tpyical otome games. But that being said, it's only a small stone's through from that boundary line. The female protagonist is still much like all female protagonists you run into with otome games. Clumsy. Inexperienced. Oblivious. It's amazing to think that any girl, and really, in the case of this game anyway, a coming-of-age woman, could be so naiive regarding *cough cough* adult matters. *cough cough*  While I do really like the premise, I think certain character routes are lackluster. For certain characters, there's hardly any draw. In my opinion, the most interesting of the several options is Iroha's route. I won't reveal any secrets or spoilers, but let's just say, it has an interesting twist that I wasn't expecting (and that I personally, found to be a pleasant surprise).  As for the art and audio... the art is fantastic. I won't even try to dispute that one. It took me a little while to get used to the art since it's a little more stylisitc than I think most otome game, but as I kept playing, I came to actually really like the art. And the audio is for the most part, alright. There's not any voice acting of the character, but I'm not particularly bothered by that. There is music which is nice, but sometimes I wish they'd toyed more with certain sound effects or something just to change things up a little bit.  Like I said at the beginning, overall, it's a good game. It's not at the top of my list of otome games though. Even if it's not my number one of otome games to play, I think it definitely has its merits and should be recognized for that.",

Although it would have been better if the animation is available in this PC version, the CGs and storylines already make this game worth playing!   Warning: There are numerous typos and grammatical errors, but if you are fine with those, this game is definitely worth your time :)",
