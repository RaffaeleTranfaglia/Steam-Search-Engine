            "review_text": "South™ Park™: The™ Stick™ of™ Truth™ (tm.)™ is one of the best licensed-property games I have ever played, though it's not without its faults.  Let's start with the good stuff. For fans of the show, it's hard to imagine a better use of the license. The designers didn't play it safe and crap out a generic game just to cash in. They took a great hook that was already built into the show (the kids of South Park™ live role-playing RPG-style) and ran with it. This is not a hard-core 100+ hour type of RPG, nor should it have been. Instead, it employs a more simplified style that requires timed button presses for attacks and defense. As a reference point, the gameplay is very similar to the 'Mario &amp; Luigi'™ RPGs. This is not only a very good thing, but it also perfectly serves the source material. So while the 'RPG' aspects of the game are not particularly hardcore, there is just enough depth to keep it (mostly) interesting throughout. What really take the game to a higher level are the production values. The game itself looks and sounds exactly like the newer HD episodes of the series. Just about every character you could possibly care about makes an appearance, and they're all voiced and written exactly as you would expect. Absolutely no corners were cut in this department - the game really makes you feel as if you are in South Park™, interacting with its characters. The story is also exactly what you would expect out of South Park™. Although the basic premise is very simple - the boys fighting over an ordinary stick™ - the story ultimately progresses in ways you could never have imagined (or perhaps you can, if you've watched enough of the series over the years). The dialogue and voice acting are excellent, and there are plenty of laugh-out-loud moments from beginning to end. There are also tons of obscure references and cameos throughout, seemingly for no other purpose than to make the most hard-core fans chuckle. The whole game really is just a huge South Park™ love fest. In terms of difficulty, the default setting is fine, if a bit on the easy side. If you want more (or less) of a challenge, you can change the difficulty at any point, which is a great feature that should allow anyone to complete it if they put in the time.  Unfortunately, along with all of the things that make the game good, there are also a few low points. Several sections involve slightly complicated 'quick time events' (not exactly in the traditional sense, but used here for lack of a better term). Setting aside the fact that these sections seem randomly out of place in an otherwise good game, the real issue is that they just aren't implemented well. The tutorials for each action are executed poorly, which can be frustrating if you don't pick up on what the game is asking you to do, exactly. Another low point comes towards the latter portion of the game, which involves a series of 'fetch-quests'. While I am sure the intent of this section was to lampoon this tired video game trope, they succeeded a little too much, as it started to get fairly tedious. It also didn't help that at this point in the game, I had already maxed out my character's level, so there was really nothing else to strive for, in an 'RPG' sense. It would have been nice if there was no level cap, with enemies scaled to your strength (or something along those lines). Lastly, and this is just a pet peeve of mine, but apparently there are several collectibles that can be missed if you don't get them the first time through - just a warning to those who enjoy collecting things or 100%-ing games.  Overall, my annoyances with the game are fairly minor in comparison to all of the things I enjoyed. If you are a huge South Park™ fan, I think this is a no-brainer. The amount of care that went into making it is readily apparent, and worthy of your money (at least, now that it's only $40 - the original $60 price point was way too much). In terms of length, it's hard for me to estimate, but I would say it will probably take you anywhere from 11-18 hours, depending on how deliberate/OCD you are. It's really hard for me to imagine a South Park™ game ever being done better than this. Needless to say, non-fans should stay away. But for anyone else (assuming you can get into the simple RPG gameplay), it's definitely worth checking out at some point.",

            "review_text": "I’ve played your typical snow, lava, or water level but a rectal, yes rectal as in your butt, level has now completed every possible variation of level design. This is just one small over the top humor and craziness found in South Park. If you watch or have ever seen the show you know this is typical SP humor.  In South Park you play as the silent new kid who just moved into town and are told to go outside and make friends. You meet Cartman, Butters, Princess Kenny, and a few others who are LARPing (Live Action Role-Playing) and playing as the humans. They ask you to join and help protect the Stick of Truth because whoever controls it can control the Universe.   You start out fighting against the elves who are played by Stan, Kyle, and some other kids. Things just get even crazier though as you go onto fight aliens, bums, and Nazi zombies. Majority of the story takes place in South Park but will also see Canada and a spaceship along the way. The story is funny and enjoyable to go through. Especially if you love the South Park show.  The game is a turn based RPG where you control a party of two but the option to switch one character with others who join you. When you pick your attack you try to hit the button at the right moment to get a perfect hit which can add a boost to the attack. Each character has one main weapon, melee or projectile, and magic attack except your character may do both melee and projectile. You can also do gaseous attacks which can explode or cause people to be grossed out.  Throughout the game when you meet new people they will send you friend requests just like Facebook. After you become friends you will start seeing posts on your “Facebook” profile from them. These can be very funny and sometimes creepy. You also have many collectibles to find in the game like all the weapons and outfits. You can also try to locate all the Chinpokomon, which are SP’s parody of Pokémon in case you didn’t know. Hence the name.  My only gripe with the game was it felt short and I would have loved many more hilarious side missions. Maybe we could get lucky and see some DLC or maybe even a sequel if it sells enough. The game was a blast to play and had a great story that had me laughing many times. If you enjoy South Park and are looking for some really good laughs or even disturbing images, some of these I can never forget, than this is the game for you to play.   Bear Rating 9.5/10",

They hit the nail on its head, the plank on the jump, and the ball outta the park - and into space.  Everything about the game is brilliant and so true to its origins that it's almost scary. More than anything, it feels like watching a marathon of all the best stuff the show has had to offer through the years. It's been a while since I saw any South Park episodes, but this game has convinced me to start watching the show again.  I haven't laughed this hard and loud in what feels like forever - there where moments when I had to pause the game before continuing because my sides were hurting so much. I swear I had tears in my eyes at one point.  Sure, the jokes may be hit and miss if you're not a fan of the show, but then again, why would you even have the game, or be interested in playing it? This is a gift to the fans and for my part, I loved every second of it. It put a big, fat smile on my face and wouldn't let go until my stomach had been churned to oblivion from so many insane pranks and jokes.  I got this gifted, but would have been happy to pay full price for this South Park masterpiece. I see it has already Overwhelmingly Positive recommendations, both recent and old, and I just have to agree - this game is truly a gem and an absolute must if you have the slightest interest in South Park and its bizarre lore and inhabitants. Wholeheartedly recommended to every wizard, ranger, thief, druid, bard - and new kid around.",

            "review_text": "  Before you read this review be aware of the fact that I'm probably a little biased due to being a South Park fan. If you are a fan I certainly recommend it if you are not check the gameplay out first before making the choice. I got this one free with the preorder of the new game. Doesn't mean I didn't want to pay for this game at all. I have the xbox 360 version of this game that's why I didn't pay for it seperately on PC. Lastly the hours are sort of accurate to xbox and pc playtime combined since I did 4 playthroughs and most of the time I left the game running while I was studying for exams, oops, so don't be mistaken by the playtime it is accurate enough to make a review about it.  This game has a lot of references to the South Park Universe also has a few to other things. In the intro I recall cartman looking like Gandalf the Grey from LOTR. The story is like you are in a South Park movie or an very extended episode for that matter. You can also expect the classic jokes and mockery that is in the series. In the game you also have access to Canada which gives me the feeling of playing an oldschool game. The ending of the game is so unexpected at the first playthrough that I laughed way harder than I should. I'm happy that this version was the uncensored one because my xbox version was censored. I'm doubting the decision if they needed the censored version. You could make a 12+ game as the censored and uncensored 18+ or so but you do not need to block countries with an older community by only giving out a censored game. Also for some reason the cutscenes can be doing some weird stuff like disappearing characters or grey screens with the subtitels.   Probably because I have a lot of tabs open or alt tab a lot to make notes or because I got a facebook/steam message   .Exploring the environment is worth it, you'll come across a lot more references and good items to equip. The game doesn't seem to support loads of back to back exploring because they game keeps track of how long you've been exploring, apparantly, and then when you explore for too long your buddy asks 'When we will continue our quest' or something among those lines.  The gameplay is pretty good, I'll be digging into some stuff deeper down below, I haven't really had problems with it aside from the control sets. You can't change them at all and some abilities require you to mash buttons which is harder on a keyboard or so. It could be useful when you could set your keys because each character requires different 'mashing', note: I'll be repeating that a lot sorry, to pull off abilities. Battles are good an active blocking system because some attacks are multiple or get executed slower or faster. Farting in this game is something they have worked on a lot in both games, refering to the nosulus rift for the next game, but in battles I didn't use it as much because I thought abilities did the job better. The summons in this game, you get them by doing side quests, are amazing and entertaining to look at when they instantly kill your enemies. The dificulty of the game is okay, I played from easy to normal to hardcore to hardcore (beating final boss with dire aids and lvl 2 armour with decent patches), I think I rarely died either to misplays and I once needed a summon to stop me from dying against the same enemy. Talking about patches, or armour effects, there are some which work when you hold two handed weapons but I didn't really get when you can use those. When you go to your armour screen you see your guy holding a weapon in his one hand but when he moves he uses his two hands to hold his weapon, unless he doesn't do that with all weapons, I still don't get it honestly. There is replay value in this game due to the several classes you can play.   Buddies:  In the game you always, unless certain parts of the game, have a companion at your side from the usual South Park characters. I'll be listing them here and what abilities I find the most useful.  Stan, a very useful ability for shredding armour until you get Cartman. - 2: an ability that hits the first row and does the same damage for a couple of seconds, high damage against non-armour. - final: like his second ability but it removes armour per hit and the last hit does the most damage and adds 2 bleeding.  Jimmy, he's only useful for letting enemies sleep or his buddy command. - 2: the ability that puts them to sleep  Butters is a good early game buddy until you get Stan, his special heals you. - 2: applies shock damage to enemies in a row. - final: a combination of everything he has but with more damage and extra effects.  Kenny, grosses them out a lot but is able to kill himself in two out of three abilities. - 2: you mash and unleash an army of mice, failed or not, if you failed kenny dies. - final: he summons an unicorn which damages a line and applies bleed, failed or not, if you failed kenny dies.  Kyle, Almost equal to Cartman in terms of usefulness but almost doesn't give any debuff to enemies. - 1: he kicks his little brother ike at his enemy, only one, and damages them plus a bleed. - final: he summons an arrow storm, doing damage either way, if you fail the button combinations or not.  Cartman, The most useful buddy to me in any type of battle. - 1: a fire damaging ability in a linewith a burn. - 2: applies fire damage to every enemy and strips armour and add fire damage, no burn.  - final: a masher of all buttons, easiest masher there is, does a 500-1K damage per hit (5 hits). It can kill anything without decent armour   Classes:  Warrior, my favourite one probably because any ability fully upgraded is wrecking. - Assault and battery: good for any stage of the game, upgraded gives bleed per hit. - Roshambo: good for the early stages, a stun. - Bull rush: good against any boss, it halves their armour and pisses them off. - Horn of irritation: A debuff to all and also pisses them off, from what I remember.  Corrections are welcome  - Ground stomp: applies 2-3K damage to every enemy, very useful lategame.  Jew, this is a button masher class, good for with a controller. - Sling of david: mashing, hits them pretty decent early but if failed you hit yourself a little. - Jew jitsu: lot of mashing again, good early game ability that stuns them on hit. - Circum scythe: easy to pull off ability and upgraded a really amazing ability. - Dreidle: button mashing fest, hits everyone for decent damage. - Plagues of egypt: an ability that almost does every debuff if done correctly pretty equal to ground stomp in terms of damage.  Thief, you thought assault and battery didn't bleed enough? Think again. - Backstab: an ability that you can use anytime that gives bleed. - Mug: typical ability, that stuns and gives you an item they hold. Mostly junk. - Execute: good against non-armour. - Stink bombs: you mash your mouse button to throw rotten eggs, gives gross. - Death of 1000 cuts: bunch of ninjas attack, system like plagues of egypt but harder, you direct your ninjas to where they need to hit and give a bleed if hit correctly.  Mage, probably the most diverse class loads of burns. - Dragon breath: a mouse masher that hits in a line and final hit does more damage. It applies burn if done correctly. - Dust of dreams: easy to do stun. - Lightning volt: electricity damage in a line. - Funnel of forest: line ability that slows, if held long enough (like kyle his second ability) and applies slow damage. - Pyre ball, the best ability in the game hands down. At least 4K damage and applying burn after tapping the same combination 4 times.",

It has funny moments, great battles, interesting characters, and a amazing atmosphere. I would stand behind the statment that this game has the best RPG battling elements I have ever seen.

How could I be so wrong!  Graphics  There is really no graphic option in game but I do not really think they are necessary since south park has a certain look to it and you do not really need AA, FOV or depth of field. I would love the support for triple monitors though.   Character classes  Fighter, Mage, Thief or Jew  Story (Spoiler free) There is two factions Kingdom kupa keep and the elves they are fighting for the stick of truth which gives the bearer control of the universe with everything you would expect from south park included.  Impressions after playing the game  This game is not your typical turn based rpg this has south park written all over it you can really see that Matt Stone and Trey Parker played a huge part in making this game it felt like I was playing a whole season of South park and I did not want it to end. The further I got in to the game the story got more and more crazy it was totally what I would expect from a South park episode and they delivered it flawlessly.

Not only that, it's deep and very immersive, which was kind of a nice surprise for a South Park game of all things. I've also enjoyed the game very much, finding all the easter eggs and references is a pretty fun thing to do while you're taking a break from story missions. There's also a ton of side-missions, so you won't be completely done story-wise after the main story is completed, there's plenty more to do.  In regards to other gameplay elements and characters, Timmy is the best fast-travel system I've ever used. You have a few companions (or buddies as they're called in-game) to help you on your journey, as well as in every fight. Some of the ones early on are characters like Butters, Kenny, Jimmy, etc. It's great. And if I'm not mistaken, nearly every character in South Park is in this, even the one's that aren't most likely have at least one reference to them.   You can clearly tell the devs cared about this game. I'm very satisfied with it, and I'm sure any other fans will be too. Even newcomers to South Park in general can enjoy it.

I have played it all the way trough 3 times and currently i'm working on finishing as a jew i wanted to see all the classes and its special abilitees xD  I have to say if you have no clue about the show it might be weird or maybe to slow in gameplay i don't know..  if you know the show and you have seen atleast a 10-15 seasons and u are a fan this game is epic from start to finish. I grew up with these guys and have been watching them since i was a teen, this game was everything and more.. all the easter eggs/goofs/items/sounds ingame and much more will remind you of some episode , i giggle all the way trough this game each time i play it .. They really did some amazing work to make you feel like you are honestly playing a part in the newest southpark interactive movie ... the game looks exactly like the series you see on tv and the humor is ... well... it's southpark, need i say more?

            "review_text": "South Park The Stick of Truth does a great job of making players feel like they are part of a South Park episode with the texture, atmosphere, and humor. Fans of the South Park series will love this game because of the refrences from the episodes of South Park layered in the game from the radio, characters, and much more. The gameplay is turn based with the player's charater and companions having to interact with thier desired move by timing mouse clicks or button presses at the right time. This mechanic makes the turn based gameplay a bit more interesting then choosing the desired attack by making players interact more in battle. It wouldn't be South Park without making fun of something or someone so the game makes fun of famous game titles like Skyrim with the use of 'dragon shout' by farting on players, which can be combined with your other attacks or used to interupt an enemy charging up their special attack. There are four classes to choose from one of them being the Jew class that can actaully be overpowered at times, but is a funny reference to one of the original characters from the south park series. The problems i have with this game are some of the achievements being difficult, some actions freezing up causing players to load from last save, and bad implemintation any replayability. The achievements are not only difficult but ridiculious because forgeting to talk to certain people to be on your friends list or missing a complete set of armor means having to restart the entire game to get back to the point you missed. The character freezing has happend only a few times but not manually saving before hand may cause people hours of backtracking as it only loads manual saves instead of auto saves. Replayability of this game is weaksauce as the end of the game is free roam with limited areas to go to and nothing really to do but walk around and finish up certain achievements. A new game plus would have been good here but I think the developers did this intentually so players would have to start over as a new character to get more hours out of this game. Overall this game is great even with some of the gripes mentioned. Fans and non fans of the South Park series will really enjoy this game unless you don't like crude humor then this might not be your game. I strongly recommend this game for the sheer fun and laughter it gives to players and hours of fun it has to offer. If you can get this game at a reduced price even better!",

Lot of turn based games let you decide your moves and you can sit back to see them play out, but not here. You have to pay attention, you have to understand delays in enemy attacks and block when they attack. Similarly, when you attack, you need to time it to give maximum damage.   The humor is good, did not find the rpg elements to bear me down with boring side quests. Everything is South Park related. If you know the show, you will get the references.   Awesome game!",

SUMMARY: All in all the game is definitly worth buying even for the step price of 60$ Matt and Trey Parker put a lot of work into this product and If we'd like more to be released we should support the release. The game is everything you could wish for in a South Park game. You will not regret buying this even if you are not a die hard south park fan. The jokes are not inside jokes so don't be worried about not understanding the humour even if you do not follow the show closely.  ",

            "review_text": "An exciting discovery, South Park: The Stick of Truth is actually a very good RPG. The story is, to put it bluntly, fantastic as it feels like I played a fourteen hour South Park episode where I was starring as a fellow eight year old who has moved to the small town. The mechanics are relatively simple but entertaining and engaging enough that they didn't feel like a negative aspect at any point in the game.  The game is packed full of adventures that are new and yet familiar for any fans, or even casual watchers, of South Park. You'll be running around all over South Park and the surrounding area and getting into trouble with all of your favorite characters throughout. I haven't watched as much of the show as I would like though the person I was playing it with is a huge fan and we both laughed our asses off through the entirety of it all the same. It even led to her bringing up clips of what certain items and locations were in reference to which made the game all that much more enjoyable.  The combat mechanics are similar to what I remember of Mario RPG in that every character has a variety of abilities that require pressing buttons at the right time or rotating the stick to get the full effect. It kept combat interesting and engaging even with the relatively simple system. The item system was fun as you find the most obnoxious weapons and gear and you can customize them with 'strap-ons' that you find.  I had twice the blast I was expecting from this game and I was expecting a good game. I highly recommend this game to RPG gamers, South Park fans, and anyone looking for an extremely inappropriate adventure involving elves, nazis, aliens, and giant fetuses. Give it a go and you won't be disappointed!",

            "review_text": "In this day and age, the standard retail game costs around $60, and provides either 1-2 hours of gameplay, or a large amount of gameplay, with no replay value at all . South Park: The Stick of Truth is a funny, well made game that fits snuggly inbetween both examples above. I finished the game after about 10 hours of playing, which is very respectable, and provides you with juuuust enough that, perhaps later on, you'll pick up a mouse and keyboard (Or controller) and try it again. The dialogue is hilarious, the gameplay is good, and Mr. Slave's... 'storage' is scary. You can meet all your more known South Park characters, like Randy Marsh, Mr. Hankey, The Underpants Gnomes... Jesus... But its not necessary to do so, and you can just go along the story without giving a damn. I did not stray from the main quest, and to reach 10 hours with minimal sidequest completion is great. You don't have to go into places you don't want to, either. I know you can enter the sewers, but I decided not to unless the game forced me, after a long history of playing games with forced sewer gameplay. I was quite happy that I didn't have to go at all. As a result, I didn't meet The Christmas Poo, but I could live with that.  The idea of a silent protagonist was obviously going to be a difficult thing to pull off, and South Park Studios and Obsidian Entertainment have pulled it off successfully. So congratulations to them. One thing I was unhappy with was the abilities, and how the were performed. almost everything involved mashing buttons on the keyboard or mouse. Wanted to poop? Mash a button. Want to use Jimmys abilities? Mash a button. Want Cartman to fat? Mash a button. It was very tedious and something I never really wanted to do after a while - But in order to win against many opponents, you needed to either A: mash these buttons, or B: use the normal attack, which did absolutely pitiful amounts of damage lategame. If you resorted to option B, you STILL have to press buttons, only this time, instead of mashing, it was timed with little 'Ding' sounds, and a little flashing light. After a while, you could play the game with your eyes closed. In fact, to test this, I beat the final boss with my eyes closed (Except for the finale, which isn't really a battle. But I won't spoil it).   Is the game good? I'd say so.  Is it replayable? Maybe after a while.  Do I recommend it? Well, if you don't mind mashing singular buttons, which are being timed against you, and are occaisionally difficult to pull off (such as creating ♥♥♥♥ Nuggets), then I guess its worth the money.",

There are also many different types of enemies that help to keep up combat variety (although there are occassional difficulty spikes with certain bosses). As you go through the campaign, you will unlock new abilities that will unlock previously unlockable parts of the map, which encourages you to explore the levels and also revisit them later on.   Story: Typical South Park fare, well written with plenty of satire, relating to various worldwide events, art pieces and celebrities. The story has many twists and is deeper than it initially seems. Many of the side quests are creatively designed, with interesting plots and characters.  Graphics: The game looks just like an actual episode of South Park, the animation is perfectly done and brings the town of South Park and its inhabitants to life. Each location is overflowing with various references to seasons 1 to 17 and each character/item/location is based on some aspect of the ongoing South Park canon.   Sound: Each character is authentically voiced, and often have very funny dialogues. A surprising amount of wit is injected into various minor remarks and it is definitely worth exploring each characters range of lines. As well as the voice acting, the music is very well done, with various songs from throughout the multitude of South Park seasons (and even certain songs from the movies) making an appearance throughout the game. Just as good as these songs is the game's original soundtrack, which is an epic, lustrous score.  Re-playability: The town of South Park is littered with collectables and loot, with quests abounding and secrets ever-present in each section. Replaying the game is also incentivised by the inclusion of character-specific achievements and abilities, and will be essential for the completionist or OCD afflicted.",

It's extreme, profane, obscene, and often disturbing.   The game mechanics are excellent. The various status effects are meaningful and useful. Each character has different abilities both in and out of combat. The game features mostly standard turn-based RPG mechanics, but mixes it up a bit. For example, using the bard's lullaby song requires you to perform a miniature version of Dance Dance Revolution. In the world map, it's more of an adventure game with very simple puzzle elements. Later in the game, the developers mix things up in the world map when you go to Canada and it switches to a top-down retro RPG view.   There are loads of collectables. You collect Facebook friends throughout town. You collect Pokemon knock off figures. You collect costumes and equipment. There's a lot of equipment, but none of it feels arbitrary. Depending on your play style, you can find a use for just about every piece of equipment. There are enhancement items to modify your equipment with that augment your play style.   The DLC are worthless really. The items are level 2 and are quickly replaced by better equipment. I bought them, but didn't use them.   I don't know if I'd say the game has replay value. I enjoyed it a lot, but once the story is over, there is a limited amount of side quests to finish. The game is pure fun from start to finish and definitely worth at least one play through.",

As for a South Park game, it truly feels like you're watching an actual South Park episode, or even a whole season, at the same time while playing.  Also, important mention is how the game plays alot like Paper Mario, with ''active turnbased combat'', by which I mean every move you perform requires you to either tap a button, or time a button pressing in order to successfully perform an action. The game also has partners, which all have their own unique abillities and spells, like such as Butters's Professor Chaos transformation (which by the way, is my favourite pick).  However, if you have no interest for South Park, or even have a certain disgust for it, you won't be missing out at all if you're not going to buy it.

Hu- how about- the Internet? The Internet makes lots of money! So give us some of that money!' 'Yeah! Give us Internet money!'  Is this South Park title worthy of all your 'Internet Money'? While the quality of the game is greater than any of my expectations for Obsidian, the notorious studio behind the butchery of several games, the volume of content is rather short. You'll find that you have completed the main quest line in approximately 12 hours, and in addition, a vast majority of side content. While ultimately, the game can be replayed as any of the classes for a different experience, the experience will ultimately be the same since the story is distinctly linear. Fans of the series will be pleased with the quality of the end product, but ultimately disappointed in the lack of content brought together for a game that doesn't quite reinvent the wheel.  Overall, my experience with South Park : Stick of Truth was fantastic. The combat of the game is rugged and well polished, rewarding players for successfully completing various quick time events to deliver devastating damage. The story of the game is hilarious and includes many head nods to nostalgic South Park episodes. True fans of the series will find that the game is one of the best liscensed games to date and delivers a unique, fun, and exciting experience that many RPG's do not deliver nowadays.  Rating : 9/10 Recommendation : 'If you're a die-hard fan of the series, don't hesitate, just buy the game! If you're more of a casual fan of the series, wait until the price comes down from $60. Currently, the product pricing is likely only to satisfy die-hard fans of the series who have waited for this game.'",

            "review_text": "This game is not a shabby game adaption of a succesful franchice that completely fails like any other game adaption. This is a game that was written, designed and developed by the original South Park creators. Including original voices and all the trademark (dark) humor the TV show has become famous for.  Because of this, South Park: The Stick of Truth feels like you are watching a feature length South Park movie. Everything is just there. The characters are spot on. The voices are spot on and the storyline is traditionally 'wtf am I watching' good/fun. Even when you're actively controlling your character the world around you feels 'real'.  You play as 'the new kid' who's parents moved to South Park after some incident involving you. And as you go out to make friends you run into the South Park cast who are in the middle of a very very serious role playing game involving humans vs the elves. The role playing game mechanics the children have made up is translated into gameplay mechanics. Foods are health potions, energy drinks are power potions and anything that gives you serious gas are mana potions.  The gameplay is fairly fun, though also fairly limited. You are free to explore South Park as much as you wish and interact with its inhabitants. Meanwhile you can raid their houses and garages for items and potions without consequence. The world is fairly interactable. Often you are able to shoot things or break things outside of combat. Sometimes leading to taking out enemies before a fight actually starts. This is a good thing because the fights tend to get boring fast.  Fighting occurs when enemies tag you during exploration. You can also tag them first, whoever lands the first blow gets to take the first turn during the combat phase. The combat mechanics themselves center around turn based combat. You and one compantion have to battle up to six enemies at a time. During a turn you may consume an item to give you a bonus and perform one attack. When all enemies are defeated the fight is won and you go back to exploration.  The fighting mechanics work and are fun. But they are only fun for so long. Especially in the beginning you are regularly jumped by enemies who force you into a fight. For me this started to get annoying because I just wanted to get to my next objective, not do all kinds of random fighting. Later in the game this becomes increasingly frustrating because fights become more frequent and enemies become harder to beat and/or appear in larger numbers.  The actual attacks are also confusing. There is a whole range of buttons and combos to use various attacks, but none of them seem to make any sense. One sword requires a left click, another sword requires a right click. The 'spells' are taught to you through a complicated 'find the right frequency' tutorial but this is never applied again during actual fights. Blocking enemies can get tedious and frustrating. The game will indicate when you need to block, but this turns out to be highly inaccurate. There is also the use of shields and armor which are apparently two different things but are never properly explained. A lot of fighting mechanics are just thrown at you and you are left to figure out how they work on your own.  All in all this is a very good game. True to the TV show and fairly ok gameplay to boot. But this being South Park, be prepared for some extremely weird and grotesque scenes. From visuals of anal probing to Nazi zombie fetuses (including swastikas) that spew various Adolf Hitler soundbites at you. If you think you know what to expect from South Park, be prepared to see them push the limits of the acceptable.  Recommended to get this game on or off sale. It's worth full price if you ask me.",

At the time it was an amazing show, that made fun of a little current issues and politics. Somewhere over the years it went from funny to overplayed jokes. When this game came out I was very hesitant as I assumed the same overused jokes were going to be repeated. However, it was on sale and a lot of my friends recommended it. Overall, I wasn't dissapointed and while there are some things I would possibly change to make it from good to amazing, it is well worth the money.   You start off as the new 'mute' kid to South Park and are promptly named Douchbag by Cartman. In a turn style action based game, you can choose from different classes of Mage, Warrier, Theif, and of course Jew. You get to dress your character up with different armor and attach bonuses. Special attributes are given, and overall it has decent gameplay. The overall story line is creative, and a huge bonus for me is the characters like Stanley, Kyle, and Cartman giving commentary to certain situations. You even get to give an abortion to a man and fight Nazis! A lot going on here.   The two things I would probably change in this game that would have improved it greatly is implement crafting. Throughout the game you collect a lot of junk, and other than acheiving a gaming award for your collection, you can't do anything else with it other than sell it. I really wish some of the junk could be crafted to make some weapons or enchantments (patches in this game) to help improve combat.   I would also add the ability to modify your party members. I would have loved several times to give my partner Butters an awesome Axe, or Cartman some better gear. The game says it updates the stats on the armor and weapons as you level up, but it doesn't quite feel the same as hand picking it yourself.   Now, if they made a sequel or prequel to this game and added maybe some form of these compoenents I would buy it in a second. Really love the creativeness that has gone into this game, and hope that they make another one in the future. Would definetly recommend.",

No, it's more than good. It's brilliant. The gameplay and world fits the South Park license so well and as a long time fan of the series, I've nothing but praise for this game.   When I first heard about Stick of Truth, I wasn't too excited. Licensed Games weren't exactly high art and I wasn't a fan of the Lord of the Rings setting because the only South Park episode with that setting I really liked was Return of the Fellowship of The Ring. But when more information came out about it, it slowly began to win me over. This wasn't this setting. It was a parody. It was still the characters and universe that we knew and loved, but using the LoTR settings as a tounge and cheek joke and it honestly worked in my eyes.  The gameplay really does fit the South Park setting with it being totally in 2D and it also helps brings fun to the turn based fighting in the game. In most RPGs you just hit your attack, and then wait to dodge your enemies attack. In Stick of Truth, they've added a mechanic where you need to time your attack to get maximum damage out of it as well as other variables, such as archers, multiple hit enemies, shields, and more. It really works to help keep the game out of repetive areas in my opinion.  The graphical style is of course the same that's been featured in the show. Normally, you'd be thinking 'lol how could a 2013 game have these graphics'. But considering the art style and joke about the South Park style, I find the graphics very charming, and helping add to the feel of the SP universe.  On top of that the game is absolutely filled to the brim with nothing but in-jokes, references, and more to the most popular and even the least popular episodes of the series. Little things like finding the Gamesphere from Towelie's episode, or finding Butters' The Poop That Took a Pee book, or even finding a certain character inside Stan's closet who refuses to come out. This game is a love letter to South Park fans everywhere, and if you are a South Park fan, this game is an absolute must buy. There is so much love put into this game to make it a game that caters to the South Park fans.  As for non-fans, I would suggest maybe watching a few episodes of the series before deciding to jump onto the game because the humor is very much like South Park's actual series, so unless you think you'll really love the gameplay element, I think you should see if the show's humor interests you beforehand before you decide to get this game. But in my own opinion, South Park The Stick of Truth is a excellent game, and shows that when developers put actual effort in, they can make a truly special game for TV Shows.",

Gameplay is thin, the controls (to fart) are annoying and it's relatively short (15 hours) for what it costs.  If this were any other RPG, it would be widely condemned. But it's South Park through and through, which means you'll both laugh and cringe at the same time. What other game will have you fighting an underpants gnome while trying to dodge a giant ball sack? What game has you crawling through someone's rear end while a gerbil sings to you? Occasionally side-splitting, often head-shaking, the humor in Stick of Truth is exactly like the show.   That's really what you're playing and paying for here. You're interacting with a 15 hour episode of South Park, lovingly nurtured, written and voice acted by Matt and Trey. The RPG mechanics are just an excuse to call it a game. You're playing this because it's just like watching a season of the show. You're going to visit all of the areas you know and love from the series. You're going to the Mongorian grill. You're going to meet up with Jesus.

As it turns out The Stick of Truth is South Park at its best, with only very little of the bad.  Central to the game is the premise. This is about children playing a fantasy RPG in their town. Everything that happens is interpreted through their eyes as part of the game and the lore they’ve made up. This creates brilliant scenes where the real world pokes through and reminds you it’s all just make believe, and everyone in the game knows it’s pretend, but they’re 100% committed to the game. Even when real ♥♥♥♥ goes down the kids never break character and just incorporate what’s happening into their game. Not at any point do they stop “playing”, and this clearly confuses many of the adults who can’t always tell if they’re playing or not.  The game itself is an old school jrpg style game with tweaks here and there to make it feel somewhat modern. You explore the town and talk to NPCs, fight in turn based combat and use tools that you discover over the course of the game to access new areas Metroid style. Cutscenes are generally brief, and it doesn’t feel like you’re watching an episode of the show, even though it looks exactly like it. You definitely “play” this game. If you’re expecting something like The Walking Dead where you can pretty much take your hands off the controls for minutes at a time, this isn’t it. I found all the mechanics to be fun to play around with, and the difficulty of combat to be balanced the way I like it. Almost every review I’ve seen complains that the balance is tilted too easy, but I don’t agree. I never died, but it was close a couple times. I didn’t feel like I could breeze through every fight without using items and abilities.  The world isn’t particularly big, but it makes up for it by being dense in detail. Given that you spend the majority of the time exploring the world by yourself it’s good that they gave it the time and care it needed. Going through every nook and cranny, discovering characters, quests and nods to past episodes of the show feels rewarding. At no point did I feel like the game was wasting my time or padding for length, even during the more mundane fetch quests. There’d always be something on the other end which would make it feel worth it. The length of the game felt just right.   I had more fun playing this than I was expecting. The way it manages to poke fun at games and stories feels fresh, and makes this more than merely a good license game. It’s an excellent game. Definitely worth playing, unless you can’t stand South Park obviously.",

Nintendo will never give us that, but Trey &amp; Matt did a hell of a job with creating a fluid, open world South Park rpg that blends some of the best characteristics from Earthbound with some of the best writing the SP creators are capable of producing.   Clocking in at under 20hrs. on the hardest setting, the game isn't terribly long for an rpg, but there isn't much in the way of grinding levels, and there are only a few sidequest collections. While I would've loved a 40hr. South Park rpg, the main storyline takes up most of the game time, and it rarely lags in quality or pacing. I rarely get to pay this compliment to an open world rpg, regardless of how big or small that open world is.  Don't forget to bring a towel and use a controller. The gameplay seems to have been designed for a controller, and not a wealth of shortcut keys, like typical crpgs.",

If you find the humor of the show unenjoyable, avoid this game. It's an RPG that is incredibly similar to Paper Mario, due to the presence of quicktime events during combat (right clicking on time to defend, clicking on time to swing, etc.) and the 'buddy' system, where you obtain multiple friends that have different abilities both inside and out of combat. If you played and enjoyed that game (or its sequel) then you should also consider this game.   PROS -Similar to South Park episodes, with loads of references -Relatively long at 10-15 hours (I finished all the quests, but not all the collectables, at about 14 hours myself) -Fun, interesting combat -You can customize your character quite a bit (but you don't have to)  CONS -Too easy: while I did die a dozen times or so, I felt like the 'Hardcore' difficulty should have been more brutal. -Quite a few loading screens (they're short, but it's still not optimal) -The music, while decent, can be repetitive -There are a couple collectables that can only be obtained during small parts of the game. If you want to get 100%, you basically have to use a guide, or be very thorough lest you have to play through the entire game twice -The saving system is poor, and obviously due to the fact that it's a console port - it uses checkpoints and I occasionally found myself using the quick travel system just to get it to trigger a checkpoint.  Overall, I would get it if you like South Park and like RPGs. If you don't like one of those two things, either get it on a large sale or don't buy it at all.",

I would however wait for a promo, since it would be really expensive if it werent south park....  I recommend it in a promo if you are just a fan of the genre and curious about it. To South Park fans however... i definetly recommend it, if you havent already bought it that is...  PS 1 of the playable classes is... Jew.... lol op  ",

The combat is also a very solid, familiar turn-based structure, but with the added flair of timed blocks and attacks, so it's not quite as set-and-forget as Final Fantasy and the like. Customization is quite varied, both cosmetic and strategic. You'll often find yourself poring over weapon and gear attachments, debating the merit of stacking certain debuffs or rigging up an anti-armor set instead. The main questline itself, yes, is about four hours long. However, this ignores the gigantic array of worthwhile side quests, which are absolutely worth noting. Replay value is also high, with four classes to choose from, each with a unique array of powers for different playstyles. Long-time fans of South Park will recognize a lot of recurring jokes both new and old, and newcomers will get a pretty strong feel for the show, in a good way. While it is absolutely worth your time, I do strongly suggest waiting for a sale. While it may be Trey and Matt's first real game, in a lot of ways it feels better planned out and executed than a lot of games released by veteran studios today. Absolutely recommended. 10/10",

The humour and characters play such a large part of the experience it would be very difficult for people to just enjoy it on mechanics alone. This is not to say the mechanics lack any thing, in fact the mechanics are fun and interesting. They managed to maintain my interest in every fight and scenario until the game ended. A difficult thing to accomplish for a JRPG style game, as after a while no matter how interesting or nice looking some thing is it becomes little more than a time sink reducing how much time you can play. I never once felt like the skills took too long or that I was forced to watch FMV's over and over. It had enough interaction to make it feel solid and engaging even when fighting the roaming mobs over and over.  South Park: The Stick of Truth is quite literally a long episode of the show, encapsulating the formula that makes the show so successful and loved by so many all over the world. A feat that is just as impressive as the mechanics turned out to be 13.8hrs later. You feel like a cast member in one of those long running episodes where they are all LARPing and fighting in the various factions. It was just fun to explore and interact with people from the show. To go into peoples homes and take a dump in their toilets. All of which is well worth the asking price, it will be a game I will enjoy replaying as another class all over again.  I'd recommend this game to any South Park fan, and tempt those who are pure mechanic gamers to give it a go at a much 'softer' price point. You may be surprised with how the game works and enjoy it just as a game with a South Park skin. But otherwise I can't see anyone outside of that enjoying it. You either love it or you don't.",

If you're a South Park fan then you will most likely enjoy the experience and find about 15 hours (assuming you do all the side quests) of typical hilarious comedy, South Park style. However if you are in it for the RPG experience I would avoid it as its somewhat basic and has little replay value.  Playing this game is almost like watching a season of South Park but playing as one of the characters. In ways, this sounds better than it is because theres very little you can infuence when it comes to the story. If i remember rightly, theres only one point in the game (about half way through) that allows you to actualy make a decision. Think of this as a simplified, comedy version of Dragon Age.  At the start of the game you get to choose a 'class' as in most RPG's however the class you choose doesn't really effect the story, weapons, or armor selections in anyway and gives you a maximum of 5 different attacks you can make. This adds little to the replay value as the story is far too linear and lets you make very few (only one) important decisions.   At the end of the day, I'm going to recommend this game to any South Park fans purely for its comedy appeal (there are some hilarious moments throughout the game). But if you are not a massive South Park fan and are instead, hoping for a decent RPG, I would advise avoiding it as its linear and very short when comparing it to other role playing games.  ",

Also i've had moments where weapons simply don't react when you press attack... they just do nothing and your turn fails?

It took me about 10 goes to get through a training moment learning 'magic', but once I got back into the game I found doing that 'magic' was earier then how the game taught me!!!!!  Also... there is a moment at the VERY end where you have to do an abortion, and it just doesn't work sometimes.  But...despite all those little snags... the game is EXTREMLY funny and well worth the play. Its quite a long game, with a strong, funny storyline, lots of references and so forth. Any South Park fan has to play this.",

            "review_text": "I will just start off by saying that this game is very good. There are a few quirky controls and frankly that is the only big issue I can find with the game other than the overall length.  The characters and dialogue are 100% South Park so if you enjoy the show, this game will be more of the same type of jokes. Most of the characters, even very minor ones, from the show make an appearance at some point.  The combat system is fairly well done. Attacking is very easy and you will be performing non stop perfect attacks within the first 20 minutes of playing the game. The defensive side of combat takes some getting used to though as each enemy has multiple different attacks that all need to be timed differently to get 'Perfect' blocks which will greatly reduce the damage you take. It only takes getting hit a few times though to get most of them down. I played on normal difficulty and did not have much trouble with any of the fights. I only had to replay three I think and only because my teammate died to an enemy attack and the enemy died to bleed or fire damage after it killed him which would have voided a playthrough long achievement had I kept going and not reverted to a prior save.  The quests in the game are not overly tedious and you are not really kept in any area long enough to get bored with it. The downside to this was that I ended up finishing up the last of my playthrough around the 20 hour mark which is a bit short for an RPG. If I had to add one thing to this game, it would have been about 10-15 more side missions.  The controls are good save for some placed where you must perform on screen commands. I played using an XBOX 360 controller and some of these events were just brutal. Learning the first spell from Cartman took me like 10 tries. There is another part, towards the end of the story, where using a controlled will make you pull your hair out. To remain spoiler free, you will know it when you get there and there are numerous threads discussing it. When you have to spin the stick for this part, placing my palm on the stick and spinning it as fast is possible is the only way I made it. Others have said that quitting and starting up the game with mouse and keyboard is much easier.  Overall, I would give this game a solid 8/10. If it were another 15 hours or so longer, that score would be higher.",

The only negative I found in the entire game is I hit the level cap (15) about 35 hours into the game as I was trying to complete every side-mission.  Combat is turn based while you control your character and one active 'buddy.' Timing of spells/attacks (clicking when the game flashes) is key successfully casting/attacking. Weapons and armor can be used by any class and are modifiable with 'patches' that can be purchased/found in-game.

I like the series somewhat and still played the game 10 hours straight in one session. It's very Immersive and has a good atmospheric soundtrack. It looks stunningly authentic, I've really never seen a videogame that looks and feels so 1:1 in comparison. Jokes are what you can expect; lots of toilet, racial and sexual themes.  I advice you to play this with Xbox360 Controller if you plan to get it on PC; I have read complaints about the Keyboard/Mouse controls and that you cannot remap them. I myself haven't tried those controls yet, controller buttons are mapped fine for me. It has three difficulty levels which you can change to/from if you think the game is too hard or too easy. I've been playing on normal and it suits me, I think you might want to try the harder option.  When the game begins, you get to create your character and later on you choose a character class. Roleplaying elements are your typical JRPG; turn-based battles, bosses, walking around town, talking to people, opening chests. Mechanics include [equip/buy/sell/loot] for [weapons/gear/cosmetics].  You may also dye and modify weapons or armor with patches and strap-ons: Weapon/gear has a slot or two and you equip passive skills on them. You found a better weapon? No worries, just unequip the mod and equip it again on the new weapon. Items and stuff you find are almost always something nostalgic from the TV show.  In battle you need to attack and block with timed button presses, just like in Super Mario RPG. You can heal your friend with items and also attack on the same turn. This might be the reason many people say the battles are too easy. One of them also want their money back for not being able to play as a girl..Yeah.  Battles also look very nice, the animation is - like I mentioned earlier - very accurately made to resemble the TV show. I can't stop setting everyone on fire.  Menu interface is fashioned after the 'facebook' from the show; Your status is on your homepage, you talk to people and they become your friends on the 'book. You need friends to unlock perks so talk to everyone you meet. Leveling comes naturally after you accumulate enough experience. When you level, you get one skill point to spend or spare. Every piece of equipment has a level requirement.   You really should try this game. Seriously, buy it if you like South Park or want to play a good, well made but funny RPG.",

Turn based timing attacks and lots of new gear keep the relatively actionless gameplay interesting. Normally, when I play games, I will have something playing on my second monitor, like a TV show or a movie, but when I played through this game, it was compelling enough for me to turn off my second monitor. There are bugs in the windows version of the game, and some of the controls are unweildly. The inventory system is brutal, requiring a carpal tunnel inducing amount of clicks to unload an entire inventory. There are some elements of the game that are left unexplained and some that are explained every time you do a specific action. That said, I was highly entertained by the game overall. The format was successful and my biggest complaint is that it wasn't longer. I really feel like this game could be adapted for a sequel, or maybe an even larger more open world fallout/skyrim type game. I know its a longshot, but I felt a sense of emotional connection with the characters, music, sound effects and visual elements of this game and I'd love for it to be the first in a long franchise. 9.5/10",

South Park: The Stick of Truth is a shining example of how a liscensed game should be. Never before have I seen a tv show/movie game come this close to the look and feel of the actual tv show/movie it is based on.   The story places you in the shoes of 'The New Kid' , a mute protagonist with a mysterious past. Your parents have relocated you to this quiet little mountain town to escape your past and to live your life as a normal kid. However, life in South Park is anything but quiet and normal...  Gameplay: RPG-Lite, as seen in Paper Mario style games. Simple to learn, and engaging enough.  Visuals: Exactly like a South Park episode  Audio: Exactly like a South Park episode  World: Lovingly crafted with many easter eggs from past episodes of South Park littered all about the town. It was actually quite fun exploring and finding all the little details. I will say though, there is one area that was featured heavily in season 17 that we don't get to explore.  User Interface: Not the greatest. The world map is pretty clunky, and the overall look of the menus lack any of the South Park charm.  Story: Over the top, South Park at it's finest.  Time to beat: If you explore and try to do everything, 13-16 hours. Quite short.  Re-playability: Outside of chasing down achivements and seeing what other classes can do, not a ton.  Bugs?: A few graphical glitches here and there. I've had my character freeze in animation once before, untill I preformed an action other than walking. During one cutscene, my character was blinking in and out of space and time. And lastly, I had one area that was littered in unintentional blinking disco lights that made me think my video card was dying. The last one was fixed by simply saving and reloading. As of 3/18/2014, I didn't experience anything game breaking.  If I must give this a rating: 9/10 (as a biased fan)  In the end, I had a blast. I recommend this game to any fan of South Park.",

            "review_text": "So how this review will play out: I will discuss the pros and cons, summarise what I said in points, give a final comment and rate out of 10.  Let's start with the pros. So this game truly captures the feel of the South Park, it is written just like the show, jammed packed with characters, popular and unknown, and looks so much like the show that one could mistake it for being an episode, even the music reminds me of some episodes. The writing in the game does not let down the reputation the the show holds, it is all still so disgusting and clever at the same time and even if you know that you shouldn't laugh, you do anyway. The gameplay is great, the combat system is turn-based and during this sequence you can control you and another of our favourite characters from the series, the fights can take time but never seem to bore you as you have a selection of attacks on can choose from for both characters. When not in a fight scene you can use the characters abilities to get through certain areas as well as cause the demise of enemies without having to actually fight them, which can save time. Customisation of the character is also very broad. Countless items of clothing, makeup, and hairstyles are at you disposal (that is when you find them on the map) which can be used to make your character unique. One can also find weapons and armours around the world map, which can be enchanted to add special effects to the item, which can be useful at later stages of the game. The world map really does show the town in a different light, in the show all they had to do was cut to another location but in the game they had to map out where everything was in the town which really must have brought insight to the fans and the creators.   Lets go onto the cons, there were not many but they all seemed to tick me off. Firstly, this game is way too short for an RPG. I finished the story, all the side missions, and interacted with almost all the characters scattered around the map in about 15 hours. Comparing that to Skyrim, where I have finished the story, done about half of the side missions and done only a little bit of exploring in about 70 hours. So there is really not much to do with it once you are done with everything unless you want to start a new game. The game also had some bugs, most were not an issue but one would make my character and my side character dissapear during a fight scene when I did one of Butters' super move, but they were still playable, making it impossible to know when to block an enemy's attacks. Another problem that I specifically found was that in the storyline there were too little main missions (probably about 7 or 8) but there were many other missions inisde it that would lead to the main objective being completed. At points it would get so out of hand with all the smaller objectives that I would begin to stop and think 'What does this have to do with my goal again?'. That personally bugged me but it may not for everyone.  So to summarise:  Pros: -Just like the show in all aspects -Writing keeps with the show's standards -Exciting turn-based combat system -Ability to manipulate the environment -Great customisation of cloting and weapons -Town of South Park brought to life  Cons: -Short for an RPG -Some bugs -Some missions for the main story seemed to be unrelated to the main focus  Although I went into depth with the cons, the pros still outweigh them. Overall this is an amazing game and a must-have for South Park fans.  I give it an 8.5/10",

        {
            "review_text": "While I would recommend this game, and I will list the reasons why, I need to start off with the negatives.  The save system is probably the worst I've ever seen in a big budget RPG. You can save anywhere anytime into any file you want - except you can't. You can create a new copy of your last autosave from the last checkpoint you passed, but that's it. In a later part of the game I went through a cave, killed some monsters, got some loot, saved a guy and made him and the Canadian Princess my friends, and I went back into Ottawa. Saved. Quit. Reloaded and was put back in the cave. Sure I only lost a couple of minutes worth of progress, but how stupid is this? For a game that I beat in 13 hours, I should be able to save the minutiae of my equipment changes. Also, I beat the game in 13 hours on normal difficulty, no guides used. This is a fair length as there's no downtime in the story, there's a whole bunch of sidequests I didn't do, and there's replay value in playing as other classes. Is that enough to buy the game off sale? Your mileage may vary. While the story had no downtime, it didn't set up the final dungeon and bosses very well. I expected the story would be the first week of New Kid's stay in South Park, maybe 5 days. As day 3 drew to a close and the game was over, it caught me off guard. I'd been thinking of other things they could've added into the game, and what the logical progression of the main story would be. So while it wrapped up nicely, there wasn't a good buildup to it.  I had some issues with the controls. I used the 360 controller setup, and I never got fully accustomed to all the uses of the triggers and right analog stick, but that's on me. More importantly, I blame the game for the problems I had with tutorials and combat. The tutorials did a bad job of informing me why what I just did wasn't what it asked me to do. Combat is worse. Sometimes the terminology is iffy - a character's melee attack comes with the instruction of 'Tap A when you see the blink', and I read tap as a repeated action, not as a single press. But melee attacks are learned quickly; they have the same blink that comes with a sound prompt that gets you to press A or X at the right moment. All abilities aren't as forgiving; they'll tell you what to do, but not give any great visual or auditory clue of when to do it. They'll tell you 'too soon' or 'too late', but without an on-screen prompt it's still hard to learn the timing. Still, sometimes you'll get prompts for an ability or to dodge a boss's special move - even that can suck when it expects you to mash a random button and the strict countdown begins before you acn react to which button you're supposed to press.  That being said, moving on to the positives;  I really enjoyed the combat. There are some comparisons to be made to the classic pre-Wii Paper Mario games in that you have two choices of physical attacks (normal or ranged), enemies stand in lines so you can only use your normal attack on the guy in the front, and the timed button prompts of your actions significantly impact the effects of attacks. I also enjoyed non-combat victory conditions that give me EXP. Gotta look around for not-quite-Rube Goldberg contraptions and set them up with a shot or fart to take out enemies before they can act. It almost felt a shame to pass on the opportunity to take part in the great battle system, but sometimes I just wanna save my speed potions for the boss, you know? The graphics and voice acting are all 100% South Park, it's clear they had the people on board. Wandering around town, you can hear all sorts of music from the TV series being played over radios or whatnot. I haven't watched South Park in years, and I didn't feel lost in any sense. I think they did a great job of retaining the identity of the show without alienating casual fans. The amount of customization you can do with your appearance, your equipment, your abilities and perks is staggering. The amount of sidequests that were made available to me exploring the town on day 1 were overwhelming. Canada. Videogame jokes in a videogame that could only work in a videogame and yet be totally in line with South Park's portrayal of Canada.",

I am usually not a fan of 'quick time' events (which are those things where you have to press keys in a certain order to get through a section -- kind of like playing Simon), but South Park does them really well.   You pick your ability or your attack, and then you usually have to do a sequences of buttons or clicks to get the maximum effect of your attack. It is not as annoying as it sounds (or at least I found it to not be annoying -- and I have a very low tolerance of this stuff) and actually adds a good flavor to an otherwise pretty typical classic 'Final Fantasy' style combat system.  The game has a really good length to it; towards the end, I was starting to get a bit tired of it, but when I actually finished it was pretty satisfying.  All in all, I'd say it was surprisingly good and very well made (in South Park style anyway).  BEWARE: This is highly uncensored and there's definitely some parts where you will want ot make sure whomever may be watching over your shoulder is of an appropriate age and mindset to see such things :)",

            "review_text": "So, after 15 really fast hours, finally I reached the end of this game. Oh, gods, I love this game.  First I have to say is that this is not a game for everyone. If you don't like South Park jokes, RPGs, you have a problem with some themes (like gays, conspiracies, aborts, sex, and your everyday average South Park episode), then THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT YOUR GAME.  I am not a big SP fan, but I know the basics. The fat, the jew, the one who usually dies in every episode... Well, that kind of things. The game is completely full of jokes and references to the episodes, so I am probably missing a lot of them. Anyway, there are a lot of references to other things, like other videogames or politics. Your average SP episode, but in a 15 hour game.  The game is easy, even in the highest difficulty. I only lost a few times, but that was my fault completely for attacking the bosses with only half of my power. The really difficult thing is to obtain some achievements, because some parts have points of no return (for example, some things may finish completely destroyed) and then you can't get all the collectibles.  About the gameplay, Obsidian has done it again: The combat system is RPG-like, but the gameplay is more interactive than your usual RPG game, and is really good.  So, summing up everything: If you don't dislike RPGs, know the SP basics, and you don't mind dirty jokes or hear about some themes people may find disgusting, then this is your game. If not, don't press the green 'Buy' button, you will hate it.",

            "review_text": "TLDR: If you're a fan of South Park, you'll like this game. Controller Recommended.  Despite a troubled development (THQ closing), Stick of Truth has shown how to make a liscenced game right. Every second of the game makes you feel like you're playing an episode of the show. You could even say this is the closest thing to a second South Park movie if you want to go that far. You're the new kid who's moved into town and your new friends (and Cartman) help you learn the basics of the game. Fans of the show will be treated to references across at least the first 14 seasons of the show, and there are points that even feel like fanservice. Combat follows a Paper Mario like set up, with your partners being one of six SP kids. However unlike Paper Mario the 'action commands' in this case seem a bit more forced. The custom made graphical style means that game always runs in real time, even during cutscenes. Said cutscenes glitch occasionally with either you popping in and out between shots or lip sync being slow. Trey and Matt's involvement is clear from the start, with this being the best lampoon of the RPG genre this decade so far.   Length: 10 Hours  Should you buy this: If you're a fan of South Park, add this to your cart. If not it's a bit of a tougher sell. If you're a fan of RPGs though it's worth a look.  Worth: I would say $15, but most sales I end up seeing this game for less than $8 so wait for that.",

All of the loveble characters are here voice acted by the creators so its almost like watching a very long South Park episode .You can pretty much access each house or establishment in South Park city that appread in the show and loot it .  There are 4 classes you can play each with uniqe skills and upgrades so game has decent replay value .  Perhaps the most imporant thing is the variety of skills and weapons at your disposal ranging from thrawing crap to using katanas . Combat in game requirs you to constatly hit timed window which makes it more fun than average turn based combat . Unfortunetly game may be a little too easy so I would recommend bumping difficulty to hardcore after level 3 .

Great writing, and all of the companions and characters throughout the game make hilarious comments as you play. I love the combat system, it's turn based but throws in mouse clicks for blocking and extra attacks as well as button mashing and random key pressing for special abilities (keeps the combat kind of fresh rather than just taking a turn). I love the story line as well, it is new and inventive while at the same time making fun of other common story lines in todays games and tv shows. The stick of truth is one of the few games where I actually want to find all the secrets and earn all the achievements where it doesnt feel like a chore or get boring, and it has tons of replayability. My only small dislikes are how short it is for an RPG (roughly 12-15 hours for me) I just wish there could be more or at least a DLC. I also dislike how there are only four classes to choose from. Don't get me wrong I love all four classes and especially the new jew class, but i'd like to see a couple more.

If you're not familiar with South Park however, I would say that the game is still entertaining enough and should still be worth your time/money when it is on sale.  Most notable upsides: - Entertaining  Most notable downsides: - Combat and difficulty doesn't feel very delicately tuned, a problem that becomes particularly noticable towards the end (one of my companions was doing so much damage it trivialized all encounters - it also made him straight up better than all the other possible companions). - It is pretty short for a RPG (my hours played is misleading as I left the game running/paused for hours even when I wasn't actively playing it)",

Little snickers and nods towards 90's rpgs of yore. 10/10  My only issue when I first bought this game was the fact I got hung up on probably one or two missions because it wasn't clear what you needed to do in order to move on.

Not that you *need* to watch the show to play, but if you don't the lions share of the best jokes and humor will pass right over you.  The overall design is a fairly solid turn based 'japanese style' rpg, but with plenty of south park flavoring and silliniess throughout. The gameplay systems are not bad, but they can be fairly readily exploited by experienced rpg players. For instance, the same basic 2-3 configurations of weapon mods and skil use I stumbled on near the beginning of the game basically carried me right up through the final boss fight.  Expect a solid 8-10 hours, maybe 15 if you really go nuts with the collectables, and there is some moderate replay value if you want to go back and try the other classes and combos.  Really though this is for the true fans, and thats pretty much how it should be evaluated, if you loved the show, pick it up and give it a run through at some point, if you don't like the show, probably a pass.",

Much like Paper Mario, the combat is simple, but keeps you engaged by requiring timed actions for your abilities to be effective. The only downside I will give the game is that if you have any experience with RPGs or even basic strategy it is very easy to break the combat system, making fights incredibly easy: for example, modifying your armor so your abilities can restore more PP than they use, modifying multi-hit weapons to inflict a status effect that stacks, etc. Luckily, the game is about playing through and enjoying all of the little jokes they threw in, and how you handle combat will not interfere with that. If you're interested enough to be reading the reviews, then you probably enjoy South Park enough that you should get the game. Just remember that they're taking full advantage of everything they can get away with that wouldn't go over so well on television.",

The new kid doesn't really talk so we don't know anything about him. He just does what he is told. After moving in to South Park the new kid will need to help Butters, an important character to the show. He will be his first friend, and after that he takes the new kid to the grand wizard, Eric Cartman. There he is recruited and thought how to fight.  Cartman explains how they are at war with the elves, their leader is Kyle Broflovski. The elves took the stick which was protected by Clyde. The grand wizard will banish Clyde from time and space for not protecting the stick. The new kid get's the name 'D*uchebag' from the grand wizard. He sends him on his quest to take all the members from the KKK and reunite them. After reuniting all the members they will try and take back the stick from The Bard. They actually manage to take it back and restore peace to the land.  The rest is for you to discover.  I rate this game 9.5/10",

However i'm glad to say i was wrong and this is possibly my GOTY so far. It's clear on playing this game that a lot of effort has gone into it and you can see that Matt and Trey (South Parks creators) have had a lot of input. As a big fan of the show i was glad to see the story and just the game in general has the same sort of humour as the show and the game is littered with references to stuff from the tv show.   The best thing about this game is that as an RPG taken on it's own merits it still manages to be a very enjoyable game. You pick from 4 classes at the start (mage,warrior, rogue and jew) and you can level up your abilities as well as getting perks for making certain numbers of friends. You also get many different types of melee and range weapons (you're able to equip one of each at a time) and can find items that add effects to the weapons. There's also a lot of customization for your character so you can change there appearance throughout the game to whatever you like.  The story is well done and is just the usual South Park brilliance with a lot of humour and making fun of gaming tropes. You play the new kid in South Park and find yourself in the middle of a struggle between the rest of the kids as they are playing a fantasy game where Cartman is leader of the human faction and Kyle leads the elves. Any South Park fan will love the story in this game.  The graphics are good as well. It does feel like your in an interactive episode of South Park as the game is animated so similarly to the show.  The Good - Great story and gameplay with that brilliant South Park humour - Loads of side quests and collectables that reference the show - Very original feeling game. Has the standard RPG elements but still manages to make a tired formula feel fresh.  The Bad - This game won't win over people who don't like the tv show  -Some of the tutorials feel a bit overcomplicated or don't seem clear  Overall this game is a must-buy if your a South Park fan.I personally loved it and it's a GOTY contender for me. 9.5/10",
