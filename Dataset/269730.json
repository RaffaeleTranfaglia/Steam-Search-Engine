            "review_text": "This game is turning into a solid golf game, the graphics are great to look at and the gameplay is getting there IMO. The main selling point of this game for me is the GNCD, the course designer. I have spent many hours on this and once you get the hang of it, your only limited by your imagination. This is a worthy successor to the EA TW series and plays a lot like it too, well if you consider that most of the people that worked on that game are the ones that developed TGC. The good thing about this game is the fact that the developers are still working on it and fixing bugs and adding stuff to it all the time, once it’s finished then this will be a solid and enjoyable title for everyone to play.  The only real problem with this game for me is the graphics issue if you own an AMD Radeon card, especially the newer models, but I think this is more to do with the Unity engine than anything else, as playing this game with an Nvidia card seems less problematic and appears to run better.  Although this game has been developed for the PC it still very much feels like a port, as its main focus IMO is for the console market, after all that’s where the money is. Anyway, if you’re in any doubt about buying this game, then I would recommend you do, especially if you like golf and have been looking for a worthy successor to EA TW series. There are also more updates coming soon, and with the number of courses made by the community, then its longevity is assured. It’s not quite the golf sim this has been hailed to be, as that title I think belongs to another game currently in development. Anyway this is money well spent on.  Update:  I can't believe that this game has now been out for over 20 months, it has had a lot of fixes applied to it and it certainly has improved since its early access days. Graphics wise this game is great to look at and I can’t fault it on that front, however the gameplay is a lot easier than it used to be IMO, it’s easier to hit straighter shots and plays more like an arcade game rather than an actual golf sim, even with all the aid’s turned off. This game still suffers with issues, originally with AMD cards and then with Nvidia cards, although fixes have been applied to fix the Nvidia issues, I wish the same could be said for AMD users, anyway putting those glitches aside, this is still a great game and I would still rate this up there with the likes of EA TW series. The games real selling point for me has been and will always be the Greg Normal Course Designer and the thousands of community designed courses out there, some of course (no pun intended) better than others. And the great thing about it is that they are all free to play, let’s hope that this stays that way.  Player customisation has been cranked up and the variety of shirts and trousers available to dress your player up has increased, but I would like to see more with also some community made ones thrown in too. The selection of golf clubs has not changed and I believe that this is something that could certainly be improved along with the option to hit shots with more back spin etc. If your looking for a game to play against AI, then you'll be dissapointed, although you can play against the 'ghost' of other players who have played the courses, whoch is better than nothing I guess.  This game does not have crowds, as it was only ever inteneded to be a week-end golfer type of game and not a full blown EA-TW clone as it does not have the PGA logo or backing. This game has only had one DLC to date, which the community was in arms about, but IMO you don't have to buy it, it wasn't like the game was unplayable without it.  @King Kyne, for a while I did feel this was a good Sim game, but then I started to play PG and somehow the gameplay in that was a lot harder and felt more realistic IMO. TGC feels a lot more arcade-ish, and since the updates, hitting the ball straight has become a lot easier. The game feels like its holding your hand and not letting you make mistakes too much, it almost feels like its restricting you. I don't associate a SIM game with something difficult, far from it, a SIM should allow you to do your own thing, it then becomes as individual as you. I have played PG for a while now, and since they introduced the horizontal swing mechanics, I personally feel that the game has improved in my estimation, not because it’s become harder, but I can now shape the flight of the ball better, if only it was that easy in real life! The reason the mechanics in PG works for me is that there is an option to create a draw or a fade, make the ball go higher or lower, but it still depends on how you “swing” the club, so it’s down to the player’s skill rather than the settings that you dial up.  Please don’t get me wrong TGC is a great game, but it feels like something that you could pick up straight away, while PG is something else and needs practice if you want to get better at it. I guess that’s my definition of a SIM, it needs to feel natural and with enough practice you start to reap the benefits for all that hard work you’ve put in. I play with all the aids turned off in both games, and PG still feels more realistic IMO sorry to say.",

I'm a former Links player and I've been looking for a simliar experience for quite some time. This game captures that experience. I'm not a big fan of the Tiger Woods gaming experience. The RPG elements and monetization scheme is just not for me.  This game is about skill and consistency. There is a learning curve. You'll be frustrated and challenged. There is no magic win button/skill/purchase. There is just you and your skill. As it should be. Trust me, I'm right up against that learning curve with only a few hours in. Out of the gate, this game feels good. Tons of potential here.  There are pretty consistent updates to the game and content additions. The community is growing and getting stronger. Support this game if you are a fan of games of skill, rather than a vapid pay to win environment.  It isn't without a few bugaboos. Nothing has been a show stopper, up to this point.  On thing that I wish they would add is some sort of visual indicator of your swing.  ",

I initially tried playing witht he mouse and found it to be quite frustrating. I switched to the Gamepad and that has made a huge difference.   Judging putting power can be a chore at first, but with practice you will get accustomed to it.  The great thing about this game is there is no skill progression. Nothing to add points to in order to increase accuracy, distance, etc. It is all about how well you can use the sticks, judge the fairways and greens, and select good shots that setup good follow up shots.  Also, no after striking modifications. Everything you do is done prior to ball striking, once it is in the air you are an observer.   I have worked my handicap index to just over 8, and won my local club season. Currently in 14th place in the amateur season.",

In fact, I only bought the game earlier today and I've already spent about six hours playing it, which in itself should indicate how much I've been enjoying it.   So far, I think the only negative thing I'd really have to say about the game is that the customization is pretty lacking. That is to say, relating to the amount of choice in cloths and accessories available to outfit the player. The course designer on the other hand looks pretty amazing.  Anyway, I'm not one to ramble on so I'll cut this short. Suffice it to say if you're looking for a quality game of golf on WIndows look no further. I'm really pleased I decided to pick this up today.",

Positives: +Looks nice +Feels like golf +Fairly realistic shot adjustment  +Adjustable swing difficulty +Good customizability overall (even works with track ball)  Negatives: -Still no driving range? Been waiting on this since release. Closest thing is to go into course creator and constantly revert your shots after hitting them. -Wind seems very overpowering. An 8mph wind can blow your ball halfway across the green. A 15mph wind and expect to aim way off the side of the fairway to land mid. Maybe it's realistic (?) but it feels like too much. -Resource hog. Maxed out with a GTX 1080 it runs choppy. -Lastly, the biggest one IMO. The game NEEDS character stats. Every character being 100% identical makes for boring multiplayer. If I go before you and you watch exactly what I did, you can take that and tweak it for success because your character is an exact clone of mine. Including other variables would reduce this and add a lot of variety to the game. Playing the finesse player or long drive player or even amateur player would add a lot of replay.",

            "review_text": "Overall a good and challenging game, but there are a few glaring issues i feel need to be addressed.  First in my mind is courses with trees. Golf is an ourdoor game, and trees make for great challenges and good looking courses, but the game's AI tends to place them extremely poorly..... Such as in the middle of the fairway, immediately in front of the tee block, and most hilariously on the greens.  Next up would be the coding for Fairway/Rough/Deep Rough/OMG WHY. The colors of the terrain are a good indicator, but the game doesn't exactly follow them.... For instance i landed in the deep rough, bad me... Wait.... It thinks i'm hitting out of water?..... 58-68%, alright, i'll compensate..... swing... and 10 yards.   Finally (and MOST aggrevating), putting. The putting mechanics seem to scale your put based on distance, and from long range you have two options, 15feet short or 20 feet long.... But as you get closer the opposite happens. I don't know how many 1 foor puts i've missed, sometimes three in a row.... Simply because the game thinks one foot away you still need almost a half swing.... Which in any other situation on the green will leave you 16 feet past.  I've yet to determine what the difficulty on couses really means (i'm assuming tighter swing control since the red band view following shots is more narrow on difficult courses).  All in all a promising game, i hope it makes it to production and final distribution.... Though if you're looking to score -13 on every round, this game will be extremely frustrating. As for the putting mechanics........ Just eagle it from 150yards out and save yourself the headache.",

            "review_text": "UPDATE as of 12/30/14  I jumped on this game with a friend the other day and I really felt the need to update my review. They have really improved this game. The mechanics are so much better than the last time I played, it is astounding.   The multiplayer is still a little weird, but it is playable.   $30-$35 is pretty steep still, but if you can snag this game when it's on sale, it would be a good buy.  ***********************Previous Review Below*******************************  UPDATE .51: As of this update, They have added turn based multiplayer which is a step in the right direction and I applaud them for this action. When your friend hits, you are still seeing them a few seconds late but I have hopes that they will improve this.   The only thing keeping my reccomendation a no is really the price tag.  I think once the ingame issues are ironed out, it will be worth the $30 tag. But as of right now, it is not.  ***********************Previous Review Below*******************************  At this state, I would not buy it unless you are wanting to play this game by yourself.  My biggest reason that I am not recommending this game is becuase of the lack of structured multiplayer. I bought this game for that one purpose and I feel let down. The multiplayer it currently has, has you select your friends that are currently playing that course and that will allow you to see them on your scorecard. From there, you go into the game and your friend hits the ball and about 10-20 seconds later, you see their ball fly after they hit. It is very hard to Play a game with friends when you want to see their shots and want them to see yours as well. If you come from WGT, You know what I mean here. Your friend can finish the hole and move on to the next hole before you even tee off. It is not turn based which may be a positive if you don't like waiting but to me, I wanted to see my friends shoot.  PROS:  -Looks Great  -Swing style like tiger woods  -AWESOME course creator  CONS:  -Lack of structured multiplayer  -Club/power/distance is off (ie 15% power with 100 ft putter will go 4 ft on flat green)  -Current courses seem very similar to eachother  Again, this is in its CURRENT state. May or may not change in the future.",

TGC is the closest golf game to Links (PC) that I have played without all the swing aids. That takes some getting used to, but you seem to develop a feel for the shots. Based on the club, lie, stance and wind conditions the ball flight is what I expect see. Having played a lot of golf on the PC, Xbox 360 and IRL, TGC is about as good as it gets these days. I'm already looking forward to TGC2 in 2017 Q1. It looks and sounds good. I shut off the commentator and the music from the jump. Event crowds would add to the ambience, but it is fine without them. A driving range, putting green and practice area would be a welcome addtion in TGC2.   My system is running Windows 10 Home 64bit and its performance is very average by todays standards.",

What I want to know however, is why it seems that no developer is able to put out a golf game where the difficulty simulates true play.    -22 on 18 holes?  [gyazo.com]   Obviously, this is someone who is cheating or doing the impossible of having multiple golfers of the same name all winning, but believe me, I have yet to play in a tourney where there weren't many, or most, people at -18 or better for a round.  Either the game is just too easy for some, thus requiring the devs to consider making it more realistic, or in a twist of irony, cheaters are all over the place in the game of golf, which is the one sport of which I know that players admit to their own errors and take their penalties.   I know these things about the game for sure:     It does not FEEL arcadish in the play.     the handicapping system is utterly being abused and needs to be revised.     Playing the game is very fun, and it is definitely my favorite golf game to date.     It is still not the game which makes it 'real' in terms of scoring potential.     I will always finish last when people are shooting -18 or better through 18 holes, and the game needs to ensure that can't happen if they want to truly make a great golf simulation.     The game is beautiful in a different way, graphically. It uses many textures repeatedly, yet somehow that doesn't seem to matter and the scenary is still lovely. It is far more organic than the Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy franchises, but nevertheless, suffers the same level of either cheating or ease of beating they both do as well.  I would recommend this game highly to anyone who just wants to play some rounds without concern for place in a match. I would highly discourage anyone who isn't a cheater and wants to score well against competition to spend the money; you won't win, and your handicap will never reflect it, for whatever reason.",

            "review_text": "6/21/2015 REVISION - Okay, so I have played this game a little more, and since my review below, they have released the collector's edition expansion, which added some new design features and a 'Seasons' mode, which, as one would guess, is a type of career mode. This addition has brought some more value to the game than it had before, and as a result, I am reversing my original 'No' recommendation to a 'Yes.'  This game certainly has its quirks, but I am beginning to like it more and more. It still has not lived up to the hype, but I have changed my feeling on recommending this game to others. If you are willing to drop the money for the complete collectors edition, you will likely not be disappointed with this game. Make sure you have a machine that can handle the graphics decently, though, as these courses come out beautifully and you want to experience them as such.  ~~~~  Original Review (November 2014): This game is not bad, but definitely didn't live up to the hype. The lack of a career mode with depth features is a let-down, and the limited amount of character customization is one even more so. Also, it would have been cool to have some sort of earnings system or something of the like that integrates with a career mode to give it long-term replay value. Also, the lack of online multiplayer features is a bit frustrating.  Mechanics - keyboard and mouse gameplay is really, really not enjoyable once you have tried it with a controller. You will notice a ridiculous difference in your accuracy when using a controller joystick over a mouse for swinging.   All that being said, the course designer is cumbersome, and almost feels like the main attraction of the game. If you want to design a virtual golf course and have the time and imagination to devote to it, this game is for you. The course designer has a lot of options and - I would imagine - is unmatched in its genre in the scope of this feature. Also, the gameplay is not bad at all, but can be quirky. The commentary is really just downright annoying and repetitive after a while.   Overall, if you are not big into golf games, avoid it. It's really unbalanced and does not have enough of the career and online features to attract a wide scope of gamers. If you are interested in designing elaborate and realistic looking golf courses and playing them for fun, it could be worth the 35 bucks, but I would honestly wait until there's a drop in price or a sale to consider it even if that is your MO.",

            "review_text": "Has potential and will keep trying it now and again but it is unplayable as a PC golf game. It has the absolutely worst mouse swing mechanics ever. It is not responsive and spongy. There is such a delay that you don;t know if it started to register your swing or not. Putting is a joke as there is no feel for the putt and that mouse swing mechanic means that you will have no idea if your swing is registered until it's too late.  It looks nice, though it seems to require a NASA computer if you want any bumped up graphics at all.  I'll keep playing it though, but it seems I get halfway through a round and give up because of the lousy swing mechanics (guess I am just wishing this would bring back that Links feel).  (edit 4/18/15) - They have improved the puting as it now responds much better than the move the mouse and hope for the best approach initially. Though I am having major issues with power for the other shots, seems like no matter how lighly I have moved the mouse forward when I don't want full power the shot still ends up being 90% or higher. I can now tell the difference in force used for putting but it seems other shots don't have the same level of sensitivity. I really suck at the game, which is okay, but I still don't feel comfortable recommending it yet.  The other issue that is more than a minor issue is that several times I have pulled back to start the shot, the player starts his backswing, I then complete my shot pushing forward and the player never shoots, he just re-addresses the ball. Have had that happen multiple times and it is rather annoying as by about the 4th time you try swinging you really are just frustrated that the other swings didn't take and are bound to have a bad shot.  (edit 8/16/15) - I have given up trying to use the mouse swing. I have started to play using the controller and for a controller based game it is pretty decent. I wish the mouse swing could be improved, that still has no feel at all, like guessing on every shot. Still not sure if I can recommend it as a PC golf game, it's more like a console port.  (edit: 8/18/15) - Starting to like the game now that I have given myself up to using a controller. It is really growing on me. This may become a recommend soon. Wish there was a neutral option.  (edit: 10/25/15) - I have changed this to a thumbs up. While I seriously wish the mouse swing worked better, using the x-box 360 controller works quite well. I still suck at the game itself but have found it enjoyable. Using the controller I feel a better level of control of my swing and the graphics are good (though I have my settings turned down as it requires more power than I have to crank them up. I recommend this only if you don't mind using a controller. If you want to use a mouse swing, I would avoid the frustration.",

It's difficult to judge shots that aren't full shots, theres' no meter to show your swing power, it seems like shot shape is totally determined by mouse movement tempo... get a little quick and you'll be hooking your way around the course. Tournament play is dull, I've only ever played 'ghost' players. There's no storyline style of play w/ some sort of career path or tour path. There's no variety of equipment or ability to maybe get some 'boost' going from an amatuer to say a pro where you swing a little faster and get more distance, etc. Overall it's not fun enough to hold my attention for more than about 10 mins at a time unless you're designing a course and then you can spend hours tweaking it (which sadly I have) and I probably won't play it much in the future.",

However, To fully explore this, you need to be able to connect to the online servers that house them. I have yet in the months of owning this been able to connect to the servers. They automatically do not connect and I have no option but to play with the single player abilities. This is not terrible, considering that even what is offered in the single player world. I would say that is my biggest let down. The other is the swing mechanics. I find that it is difficult to manipulate and is at best on the line of a phone/tablet application. Where those options can be very annoying and frustrating.   If I were to be grading this game, I will give it a 5 out of 10. There are great ideas that are placed in the building of the game. There is a a lot of potential on where this can go. With the DLC, this does enable someone with my inability to access the online part a chance of competitive golf. The drawback is all the technical issues, bugs and/or glitches. Since I also have not been able to experience the online portion, I have lost interest in what is the base game. The simulation is not pure and if they are trying to advertise as a golf simulator, then they may want to check again as a possible arcade game.   I would recommend this game, if the support can figure out the issues. I am not saying do not buy, but rather just be wary that this game has a record of issues to be worked out.

With more and more companies releasing games for a higher price it surprises me that they are releasing these broken games to customers without any updates or acknowledgement that the product is broken. A little consideration to fans that supported the company before release would help a lot more. I would recommend this game had it been fixed by now with small graphics errors but I cannot.
