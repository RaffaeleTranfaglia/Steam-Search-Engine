            "review_text": "Its retro, and as the dev stats on the title page a challenging homage to the 80's. It has a nice melodic background music. Its bloody hard and will take a lot of gameplay to beat. Nice.... and bloody hard.   The main character is Dwaine, a brother from another motha, or in this case a planet where guns grow on tree's or at least pods for Dwaine.... and the guns are big, but you need tons of bullets to knock most opponents out.. other weapons are available. which you accumulate on beating levels .... beating bosses, which then makes other levels beatable.   With card drops and achievements, for a few bucks its a blast, literally ...",

            "review_text": "YIKES!  From the sound-effects to the level and enemy-design, this game wants to be Megaman so bad it hurts. It's too bad that Gunworld is completely insufferable from top to bottom. This is one of those games that's difficult for all of the wrong reasons.   Why is this game is so difficult? It's because Dwayne (Dwaine?) is on the wrong-end of the screen at all times. When playing a 2D platformer, it's important to be able to see what's ahead. This rule was established back in the 80s. When the hero of a 2D game is running, they should be in the very center of the screen. Instead, you have very little real estate, so if an enemy appears, you probably won't be able to react in time to avoid it.   Alright so let's break it down. In the City stage, Dwayne has to jump between conveyor belts. There's enough space ahead of Big D so he can see the jumps he has to make, and not much else. At one point, a large fire-spewing robot is going to spawn out of seemingly nowhere. You'll have no idea this robot is here, until you jump off of a conveyor belt, bump into the mech, and fall to your death. When you restart the stage, at least you'll know when that particular mech is going to appear, so maybe it won't kill you again. I'm hesitant to refer to this as 'trial and error' game-design. It's more like you get the middle-finger at every opportunity, simply for having the gall to play this game.  At this point, I don't even have to find other aspects of this game to complain about, it's already a failure. When you're practically expected to die just to know what's ahead, then the game is an absolute mess. The worst part is that fixing this game shouldn't be a complicated process. All GunWorld really needs is a handful of improvements and it would be playable. I suppose that's how developers make hard games. They break all of the established rules just to guarantee easy deaths for the player.  I'm done discussing this pile of filth.",

            "review_text": "This is a retro-ish 8bit stylised platformer game. The concept of the game is just a no. It defeats the purpose of the entire game.   Pros: - well, it actually looks nice, reminds me of some old games - additional guns are interesting  Cons - this game is very hard, maybe not like NES Silver Surfer like hard but still hard - only three energy bars and no health pickups - only three lives with no secret lives - someone pointed this out neatly - enemies are bullet sponges - there are maybe 10 different enemies not counting bosses",
