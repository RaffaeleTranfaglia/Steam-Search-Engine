For example, I like very much the game 'Gas Guzzlers Extreme', though the 'GGE' has its own defects, but I really enjoy 'Gas Guzzlers Extreme'. It's a pity that there are too little such games. And I wish more games of such type but of HIGH QUALITY. 'Glacier 3: The Meltdown' is the worst game of such sort.",

Controls are ok, but the physics are atrocious, with the cars rolling andf pivoting like office chairs (despite going fast - how fast? no idea... on ice)... The camera is unmovable and thus you have little idea what is going on. If it was in the driver's seat I would say it is 'realism' but its not, its a roooftop view.  This was in a bundle I got with something else I wanted. Still had to try, and I will be uninstalling it right after this review.  1.5/10",

I would recommend you this if you have one of those annoying cousins that don't stop annoying you about wanting to play in your PC. Just plug this game in, and I bet he will stay quiet for some time.",

It's pretty challenging at first but then after a few minutes you are pretty much beat all the A.I.  No achievements, no trading cards, no need to put your cash on it. I got it for free so I really can't complain much.",

Pros: Addicting, very fun, cute graphics, different game modes Cons: no graphical settings, sound effects are off when game is started up, no split screen, no controller support, no real story   for me the pros overweigh the cons. personally i wouldnt pay 10$ for it, maybe 2 or 3. i got this game for free though. :D im very happy about it. If this game were to be remade or stuff added to it, im sure it will be a best seller!! It has so much potencial!!  I rate this game 9.5/10",

Second, the game has no way of telling you the controls (have fun mashing the keyboard).  third, the cars handling is uncontrollable, also the cars fly like they're made of cardboard. Sometimes they even just fly off into space if youre in a certain angle.  Fourth, theres little to no content. The story mode is just 3 sets of 5 courses and they're reverse variants and 6 challenges.  Honestly, the best you can get from this game, is if you gift it to someone as a joke",

Oh cmon, dont be such a wuss, real gamers dont need tutorials. This should also be renamed to 'Ultimate gaming reflex tester' - drive car on drugs with some guns on it while pressing the hell out of your keyboard. Something we never had, 10/10 for gameplay and controls. +No mouse needed, cuz why you need to use both hands for racing like in new games when you can race with one and do whatevah you like with the other? Saves your time! 10/10 time saver +Very cheap, only 9 euros for all this amazing stuff you recieve...who needs šome awesome gamepacks on sale right now for 9 euros who really are worth around 40 euros if you can have this amazing racing game that will test your ultimate gaming skills and creativity? Who knows maybe you will become a writer of next Fast and Furious franchise after traning on this? + Came out in 2010 ohhhh this is great, because it means there wont be any updates and noone will spoil your own storyline and you can make bunch of new ones, thats awesome! Add some princess Romea and prince Juliet there.  Cons:  - Thank the cat god I got it for free... - I feel sorry for whoever actually bought this...accept my sorrows, please. - Still better than Twilight.   ",

I press play, I get a temporary black screen then it stops responding.  I got it to start once and when it started the screen was nearly completely washed out and I could barely see anything. I clicked around the screen hoping I could get to the options and fix the washed out screen but the game stopped working.  I had to repeatedly press play and wait for it to stop responding over and over for 5 minutes just so I could write this.  The fact that the developers even released this and are somehow charging money for this is ridiculous. I got it for free and that was too much to ask for this.  Just don't get this, you'll be much happier without it!",
