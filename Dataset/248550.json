            "review_text": "Megabyte Punch is a fighting/beat 'em up game Developed by Reptile. I literally heard nothing about this game untill I found the Steam page for it, watched the video, and bought the game on sale. Was it worth my money? For the most part, I found the game pretty fun. There are three different game modes to play: story mode, tournament, and versus mode. The story takes place in a computer world where the heartcore, the giver of life in your village and world, is stolen by a corrupted empire. You play as a robot fighter, fighting off the empire and saving your village from destruction. The gameplay is very reminiscent of the Super Smash Brothers series, as you have basic attacks as well as powerful attacks meant to knock back enemies, but there's a twist. Enemies in the game are made up of different robot parts that can be dropped upon defeating them. See an enemy with a cannon arm? Beat him up, and if it drops, its yours to equip. Parts range from movement buffs, to extra defense, to special attacks, and it's interesting to come up with different combinations to make your character the way you want. You can even find hidden color capsules to personalize your robot even more! Boss fights are similar to a regular match in SSB, where you rack up damage on your opponent to knock them off the stage. Defeating bosses will give you new parts you only catch a glimpse of from common enemies, which makes it all the more satisfying to use the part back on them. The gameplay, while fun, can get repetetive after a while. most of the enemies are no threat at all, being easily knocked into a bundle and shot off by your power attack or rockets, and some of the platforming can be a bit frustrating at times. The visuals are simplistic, bearing resemblence to polygons and geometric figures, but it's very colorful and charming. Combining this with the great soundtrack creates some interesting themes in the stages and areas of the game. Really, my only main complaint with the game is the multiplayer. Have you always wanted to have SSB-like battles with your friends over the internet on your PC? Well, you'll be severely dissapointed, because this game only has local multiplayer. That means your friends have to come to your house and play the game there. Also, unless you've played the main game for a decent amount of time, you won't have any parts to customize your robot with for multiplayer. Overall, If you like customizable robots and SSB adventure mode, you'll like this game. If you want a good multiplayer game for steam and don't like playing fighting games by yourself, I would skip this game.",

            "review_text": "Here's what I have to say about this game: Never have I been so wrong with first impressions.  When I first saw this game, I was extremely skeptical. I didn't think that the art design was all that appealing, and I didn't think it would play very nicely. I bought the game along with fifteen other games in a bundle, and I was certain that this would be one of those games that I would spend 15 minutes on and never play again for the rest of my life. Several hours later, at 4:45 in the morning, I found myself still playing this game.   This game is basically the God-sent answer to fill the Super Smash Brothers hole in every PC gamer's heart. Rather than being a blatant ripoff, however, it embraces the combat that makes the series so fun but then allows you to create your own, unique character with its own fighting style. With more than a hundred parts to customize your robot with, you can make your character truly unique. There is a full, fleshed-out campaign with plot that gives explanation to everything's existence, and the opportunity to find new parts for your robot.  If I had to complain about anything, that list would be short. Here it is: There is no online capability at all. The tournament mode should at least reward you for trying, to have incentive to keep playing it. There is no 'versus' mode with bots.  But I'm not complaining otherwise. Great game, highly recommended. Extremely recommended if you enjoy local co-op, and have a couple of spare controllers handy.",

            "review_text": "Megabyte Punch has an amazing soundtrack, one that I can't help but hum along to during and after playing. Gameplay is fast and smooth, like cutting butter with a warm knife, while early game can be almost a cake walk (as expected), the final levels will force you to play better if you want even a chance to win, but man, does it feel great beating that final boss.  Local multiplayer may not be everyone's cup of tea in an online focused era, but I would still recommend the game if only for the singleplayer content. Eight battles against AI opponents to win special parts, whose difficulty rivals even that of the final boss, and six levels to explore with six bosses to defeat, and more secret levels.  150 parts are advertised, though there's more like 20ish abilities, this isn't bad as it offers the player a lot of choice to customise their character to have the abilities and looks they want, and 30 color schemes to choose from. I also discovered what I think is a bug with the color selecter. Now normally it paints all your parts, but it doesn't paint ones already in your inventory before the color was chosen, this can be used to combine many different colors and parts to make a truely unique character.  Story is alright, though I don't play games for a story, that's what a book is for. It contains some humor, and references to computer technology.  Overall, I'll rate Megabyte Punch a 10/10, I would gladly play through the adventure again.",

            "review_text": "Megabyte Punch feels like a Super Smash Bros type fighter, which in reality it is, but it has a wide variety of customizations that enhance your fighting technique. With the Smash fighting mechanics I easily learned how to play this game. The customizable moves create a unique way of fighting through the campaign with each combination of custom special moves and stats. The customizing mechanics are well built and I found no problem figuring out how everything worked even without a tutorial.  While in story mode the friendly NPC's ripped on the RPG genre in a very humorous way. I found myself laughing at what they said as a person familiar with games like The Legend Of Zelda. When I got into the fighting portions of the story I found myself doing lots of circles to find all the loot scattered and hidden around the map. Each level took about an hour to finish. The story itself was very well constructed and written, with a great plot and story arch. though I didn't finish the story I was very happy with what I did get through.  While I was fighting the enemies I was exclaiming 'HOLY S***!!' because the way to kill enemies is to bash them against the walls and have them explode into and through the walls. One instance where this was very apparent is when I purposefully kept hitting an enemy into a wall to increase his damage percentage to a very high percent, when I pulled my finisher move on him he demolished a huge chunk of wall. This shock factor only really happens when the walls are destructible, and for the second level all the walls were indestructible so the shock factor dissipated.  The games graphics aren't anything to fancy, they are quite dull in modeling but make up for it in color. The character recoloring was welcome in making the game very colorful, I even made my guy looking like Batman, bat wings and grey color.  The Tournament mode was a very welcome challenge. I never got past round 5 because the bots are super powerful, compared to story mode. Their damage equaled mine and had every customization that I myself could have. I found myself having as much AA damage as possible and hitting them with ariels to maximize my effectiveness in battle.  ~~~~RATINGS~~~~  Replay Value : 7/10  Game time (estimated to completion) / Cost : 25/15 10/10  Artwork: 5/10  Story: 8/10  Mechanics: 10/10  ~~~~~~~OVERALL RATING~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~ 80/100 ~~~~",

            "review_text": "After spending considerable time with this game, finding all the collectables and playing numerous matches with my friends, what I can say is that this game is the reason PC needs more 'couch' multiplayer games. This game is an utter delight and truly a hidden gem in the sea of Steam.  The presentation of the game is stellar. I'm astounded by the level of finese Reptile managed to achieve with the free version of the Unity engine. This game has a bright, colorful aesthetic with really nice looking robot models and an old-school feel to level design that screams '1990's side scroller'. The music is wonderful, and it all gels together amazingly.  The gameplay is nothing to snuff at either. The game is split into two modes of play: the side scrolling stage-based Adventure mode, and the stationary Smash Bros. style Fight mode. Adventure mode feels a lot like Mega Man, where you go between battle rooms defeating enemies and work your way to the end of the stages. There are six levels with three stages per level and a boss fight at the end of each. You defeat enemies by building up damage on them ala Smash Bros, then using a powerful attack to send them flying at killing speed towards a wall. Enemies will often carve deep into walls, giving you a real feeling of impact as their bodies slice through the terrain of the level that is truly satisfying. As you progress, often doors will lock you into a small arena where you need to defeat multiple enemies before proceeding, which also spawns a checkpoint if you die. Along your path, you will find two kinds of collectable. The first thing you get are Bits, which can be collected for an extra life, 64 netting you a 1-up, and after each level Bits can be spent in the store to obtain rare parts. Speaking of which, your other collectables are a plethora of robot parts, each one having different properties you can get by adding them to your robot in real-time. When you pick up a part, you get the option to attach it to your robot immediately as you play through the stage, letting you not only see and apply your own progression, but also giving you an immense amount of autonamy with what upgrades you want to apply. The part system lets you really choose what kind of play-style you want to go for. There are 150 parts to collect total, each giving you a variety of stat boosts and special attacks, so go nuts.  After you're done with the Adventure mode, you can play in the Fight mode. The goal in Fight mode is to build up damage on your enemies then send them flying off the stage, like Smash Bros except with the customization of Custom Robo. There are two ways to play in the fight mode, the first being a Versus with 2 to 4 local players (no bots), or in an 8-round 1v1 tournament against a series of 8 bots. The Versus mode is rioutous fun to play with friends, and if you can hook your PC into a TV it can literally be fun for hours. After showing it to my personal friends, I've had testimony that this game is better than Smash Bros. While I don't necessarily agree, the appeal of the multiplayer is apparent. The other mode that can be played in Fight is the Tournament mode. The goal is to defeat 8 consecutive AI opponents, all randomly drawn from a pool of pre-built opponents. You can switch your build in between each round, and it plays much like Brawl's All-Star mode where you must defeat each opponent with only a limited number of lives in order to achieve victory. Placing in the top four nets you bonus Bits to spend in the shop, which is extremely useful for getting some of the rarer parts, and getting first place nets you rare parts.  This game is truly great, but it definitely has problems. First, customizing your robot can be fairly slow, as you have to page through 15 pages of parts, 10 parts per page, with no decent organization. Given, the parts are arranged into categories by a sort of soft transition, but it would have been nice to see the parts be separated into different scrolling pages based on the part category, to speed up the sorting process. The second major problem that this game has is that there's no way to play free rounds of Fight mode against a number of AI bots. If you want to play alone, all you have is Adventure and Tournament; playing in a 4-player free-for-all requires you to have 3 friends lying about, and there's no online to fill in the gaps. Third, the game's AI can be a little predictable at points. I found it easy to exploit AI behavior in certain ways, such as spamming ranged shots to build damage without having to move whatsoever, and the AI would just walk into the shots instead of trying to shield and jump away from my line of fire. Fourth, it would have been nice to see a little more part variety. I know, there's 150 parts in the game, but many of the parts are simply aesthetic changes. However, the variety is a very minor complaint as there's quite a bit of variety in there and many parts share stat boosts in order to build robots in certain ways, but it just gets under my skin. And finally, farming to get all the parts is a pain, some of the parts seem to have horribly low drop-rates. As a player who's sole goal is to make his multiplayer games completely multiplayer ready by having everything available, this irked me.  All-in-all, this game is great, I'd recommend it in a heartbeat, and I'm surprised it managed to go under the radar like it did. This game is one that will even make non-gamers entertained, and it's great for parties. If you haven't gotten it, get it now. For all it's small flaws, this game is truly great and will be an excellent addition to your library. Just make sure you get some controllers and friends to truly get the full experience.",

Damage by itself won't kill you, but a well placed kick or punch that sends you flying into the environment will. Co-op up to 4 players in adventure mode, a versus mode and a single player tournament mode keep things interesting. 150 bot pieces and colors to unlock by destroying enemies and collecting their parts. Fun time, all the time.",

Chunky graphics that make impacts seem heavy and destructive, nice tight gameplay and simple to learn mechanics. Customisation also feels nice in that abilities are often shared between parts, so you have a nice balance between abilities or perks and aesthetic value. Shame about there being no online multiplayer, which will hopefully be rectified soon. Also combat can be a little disorientating and tricky to master when you're combo-ing in the wrong direction. Also, the price tag is a tad steep at the moment, but if it's on sale, do not hesitate! There is nothing glaringly wrong though, which means I have much love for this little game, definitely one of the most complete and personal SSB clones available.",

The soundtrack is incredible, there's hundreds of combinations of ways you can customize your fighter (including clear ice and solid gold color options) and it runs rediculously better than I'd first expect given the graphic quality. Also it has local multiplayer options, so you can fight with, or against, friends, up to 4 players total. I wish I had someone to play with this so I'd have more of a full experience with this, but the game's still great in spite of not having that option. Again, soundtrack, I love it. Search the title on google and you may find the bandcamp page.",

Game tends to get a little repetitive as you make your way through it as after the first 1/3 of the game new parts are mostly just cosmetic changes to previously discovered parts and so your ability set does not see much change (at least for me) after the second level.
