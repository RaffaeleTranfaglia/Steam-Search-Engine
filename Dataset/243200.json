            "review_text": " “As the stone over the scarab, so rules the scarab over the stone” –  The riddle from the Ancient Vault    After finishing Memoria’s prequel   „The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav”    I was anxiously waiting for this game, wanting to know how exactly would Geron’s and Nuri’s tale end. Sitting to the game I had some expectations about the overall course of it, and involved mechanics. I was somewhat uneasy about announced introduction of another main character –  Princess Sadja , but overall I did not expected any drastic changes between “Memoria” and its predecessor.  To my surprise however, after just a couple of minutes I had to completely abandon all these previous assumptions, and for the benefit of the game that is ! Not only all the strong points of “Chains of Satinav” were still present – with its stunning music, beautifully hand-painted backgrounds and complete, detailed voice-over, but also, to my content “Memoria” introduced a handful of new ideas making the game even better !  In ‘Memoria’, contrary to the previous game, we follow two seemingly separate stories. One starts right after the events of the previous game, which left Nuri, a former fairy and Geron’s girlfriend, turned into a Raven, and the featuring Princess Sadja, a heroine from over 450 years ago, whose footsteps we’ll have to follow. The narrative is written perfectly, telling us the truly moving story, full of surprising events, magic and sacrifice. The characters are likeable, interesting, and their motivations are truly believable.  The main flaw of “TDE: Chains of Satinav’s” gameplay were its puzzles, which although solid and logical, turned out to be quite simple, and after a while may have felt a bit repetitive. In “Memoria” this problem is nonexistent, ‘cause almost each of game’s many brilliant puzzles feels unique. All that thanks to an improved  magic mechanic , greatly augmented in comparison to “Chains of Satinav”, with both spells variety increasing, and their impact on puzzle solving changing dramatically. Now we are allowed to choose from much larger diversity of powers than before, each coming with a distinct applications.  Summing up, I have to admit that “Memoria” has left me speechless, and after finishing it,  I won’t hesitate saying that this jewel should be counted among best adventure games of the last decade.  Both plotline and the puzzle design in this game are as close to perfection as I’d dare to ask, and above that we are once again pleased with astonishing aesthetics known from the previous game in the series.  I’d strongly recommend this game not only to those who enjoy this particular genere, but also to anyone who has even the slightest liking to a top grade fantasy tales !   Pros:  - Deep and intriguing plotline with two entangled keynotes. - Huge amount of witty puzzles. - Unique magic mechanics. - Beautiful soundtrack perfectly fitting the story ! - Sequel to   “Chains of Satinav”   - Set in a vast fantasy setting of ‘Dark Eye’   Cons:  - Boxed “Collectors Edition” available only in Germany",

I finished the game for the second time just now, and I must say, this game is absolutely wonderful.  Wonderful characters, story and voice acting (I played it in English). I loved Sadja and the Staff chemistry, and I think I LOVE the Staff voice actor.  Seriously, I'd listen to him talking forever.   Play. This. Game.",

            "review_text": "Sadja al-Kedir is magnificent.  Seriously, I really love how it all ties together, and how the resolution throws a different light on everything that has happened.  The characters are varied and diverse, with their own different traits, backgrounds, goals and motivations.   Sadja is a princess, fiercely ambitious and bold, calculating yet terribly reckless - you just really have to play her story to get the full experience of this amazing lady;   Geron is literally an unsung hero, he is underestimated (somewhat justifiably), has a selfish streak and can be dense, but he has his extremely lucky moments of ingenuity and resourcefulness, few though they may be;  Bryda is the perfect mage student, top in all forms and classes, anticipated by senior academics for great things - but she is so very dissatisfied by the current state of magic - obscure, mundane and highly unexciting;   Yet, ultimately, they share a few common themes: desperate determination and loss. And that really shines through, by the end of the story.  Not to mention, it's really super to have characters who have their non-white cultural roots clear to be seen in their personalities and actions, while not falling into roles reflecting exoticism. Characters that stand out from the cast, nonetheless! And are not all-good nor all-evil! Huzzah!!  I really hope there will be more games with such good writing!! I hope daedalic will produce more games featuring characters of Sadja's ilk!!  Please playyyyyyyyy",

            "review_text": "So my 2nd game of the Dark Eye Universe. You should really play first The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav.  The sequel gives new hope that i lost after the ending of TDE:CoS bad ending/ outro. So burdensome the first part story ends, so happy i am about this 2nd part. The story has many great parts (ending is better then part 1, but still with a little sad factor), the graphics are still unique and the style work good with all other parts together. The sound is most time plain and appropriate. So you can focus on the main point of the game (riddles, art of design and the tale).  I give this game 92 % for point and click fans. Other people should test it somehow. The price for 7-12 hours is high even for this quality. So wait for a discount and then i hope you enjoy your buy with many funny hours of playing. Thank you for reading. ",

            "review_text": "I bought this during a sale, so I definitely can't say I was against the price. I was very happy to catch it on sale. What I would say though is that I sincerely wish that it had clearer display towards the top of the store page that told how the game was a Sequal. With the title what it is there's no easy way to tell it is a sequel as there is no number, nor is there a specific statement in the trailer that says it is the sequel. It mentions the first game in the trailer but it lists it as another game the creators made not specifically that it was connected to this one. It definitely is something that is going to have me triple checking games to see if they are the first game or not now.  Aside from this I am genuinely pretty happy about the game. The art, the way the story is told, the music. They all come together beautifully in a way that has me wanting more. I had to look up how many chapters there were within game so to try to keep myself from finishing it too fast. There were several times here and there I was stuck in ways I didn't feel I should have been however. I could tell generally what the overall goal was of what I needed to do even when there wasn't too clear of instruction, but because of how items and surroundings lacked sufficient information I was unable to easily decipher what to link together. Without, as the character would say, 'Random Guess Work.' One place in particular in game was irritating to no bounds for the way one would be constantly reprimanded for making a tiny mistake in a way that made it feel as though there was absolutely nothing one could do. Three characters in the same area, two shouting the third's name so repeatedly that I sincerely think I will never be happy to hear it ever again despite it originally being what I thought was a great name choice.  Overall I'd say it's worth it on sale or not on sale if you like a colorful tale told in a way that makes you feel thoroughly immersed for the way you help to forge the story itself. I would also add despite being disappointed I accidentally played a sequal game before the prequel, this game could be played without the other for how it is an amazing story all on it's own.",

Handy enough, the user Interface didn't change all too much to it's prequel and this was perfect for me. Besides, the UI disappeared, unless I needed it. Which supports immersion quite nicely.

Otherwise, you might be confused about much of the story, which is never re-explained for new players. That being said, this is an EXCELLENT adventure game, even better than the original in my opinion. Good puzzles, GREAT characters, excellent voice acting, AMAZING story...yeah. Just awesome. It strays from the original in that there are actually two main plots: 1) the framing story, which takes place with Geron and Nuri after the events of the first game and 2) an entirely new story and characters set some 400 years before, during a time of epic war. In many ways, this backstory is actually WAY better than the framing story, although they do come together in the end to make it one cohesive game. They could just as easily have made this flashback its own game set in the same universe. It's that good. I had two glitches while playing, one near the beginning that required a complete restart. It happens if you do things out of the 'intended' order. The other, one of the characters' words switched suddenly to some other language for a line or two. I didn't miss out on anything due to subtitles, but it was jarring.  Overall, a sequel that's as good or better than the original. A fascinating adventure game. 10/10",

Well it would have to be, obviously, the art. All the areas areas to explore are simply gorgeous to look at, and most of it is interactive (main character will at least comment on things you look at).  What's the worst thing about the game? The puzzles are VERY contrived. So many times I got stuck simply because the answer to a puzzle is so difficult to figure out. I had to use a walkthrough after hitting brick walls, but I don't regret it as it allowed me to delve further into the interesting story and awesome visuals.  Example of contrived puzzle : to find a gem, one has to pour wine into a mold, do a service for a mage hidden in a library (seriously, you only see his shadow), find out he can solidify things, then have him solidify the wine. I had no clue that I could use the wine for that. There's also a maze (I HATE MAZES) but THANKFULLY you can skip it after enough time has elapsed (after getting lost). And the end is, to not spoil anything, just strange.  What's okay? The voice acting is well done, ESPECIALLY the talking staff. Music is... forgettable but it fits, controls work very well and the magic spells gives a nice twist to gameplay, though it is underused in my opinion.   Is it worth it? Yeah! Absolutely. If you can forgive yourself for using a walkthrough and just enjoy the story. Seriously, the puzzles are just a headache otherwise. Some parts can be done without one though.  However, I recommend playing the first game first, as it is a direct sequel and many things in this game will be unclear otherwise (why is the fairy turned into a raven?). I didn't play the first game, but I regret it.   Chains of Satinav, get that one first.    ",

The technical problems I had with the first game of the series were gone here... And I'm hoping they will release a new chapter on the series continuing the story about Geron and Nuri. That's the main reason I liked the first chapter more. The story about that couple was the main reason I was waiting to play this title... A bit disappointed about it, because here the main story is about Sadja and her quest and the relationship between Geron and Nuri stays as a secondary story.   For all those you don't know, both games are based on the German Role-Playing Game created by Ulrich Kiesow in 1984, very famous in Germany but not so much in the rest of Europe.",

Worth buying and worth the price if you enjoyed the first game, but I'd recommend waiting until it goes on sale.",

This is not to say that every step of the game will take your breath away, but the storyline pulls you into it's world. While I was playing this game I enjoyed it and wanted to keep playing it. After finishing the game? I wanted to play it again. I had to talk myself out of playing it again so soon but I look forward to playing it again once I have forgotten a good bit.   Some users say that you MUST play the prequel before playing this but I disagree. I actually played this first not realizing the two games were connected and playing the prequel second, for me, made both more enjoyable. Whichever order you play them in, this one is just so wonderful.   A must play! Even better if you catch the Daedalic Entertainment: armageddon bundle on sale.",

You play as a Geron, a bird-catcher, trying to restore his girlfriend who's been turned into a raven by a curse and also as Sadja, a princess trying to make a name for herself. Two people, two stories, two different time periods, one awesome epic adventure.   Although this is a game, to me it felt more like an interactive story book. The puzzles we're not that difficult, but not too easy either, which I think is a good thing since it doesn't ruin the pacing of the story. Puzzles make sense, no weird contraptions, no pixel hunting, and it all just fits well in the story.  Absolutely worth it, even if it weren't on sale.  I wish there were a sequel...",
