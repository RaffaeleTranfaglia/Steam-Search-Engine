            "review_text": "One of the very first games I played as a child back in the 90's, Star Wars Dark Forces is without a doubt, one of the best Star Wars games I have ever played. This game is similar to Doom 2, where the levels are fairly linear, finding keys to locked doors is a necessity, and there are several mini bosses that you will encounter. I personally am not too much of a graphics freak so the pixels do not bother me, but that should not turn anyone away from this gem of a game. I bought this game during one of the sales (Summer/Autumn/Winter) at around $2. While the replay value is very low as there are a set number of missions with no achievements or multiple endings, you will get your $2 back and more. Pass on the coffee or candy bar and do not miss the rare chance to be able to punch a Kell Dragon in the face.  *The game requires DosBox however, with the Steam download, everything will be set up for you to enjoy as soon as the game is downloaded.  Story/Characters:  You follow Kyle Katarn before his Jedi days as a Rebel mercenary. In my opinion, the story is a tad on the darker side when it comes to Star Wars. The basic premise is that you are the hero as you try to defeat the Empire with their new Dark Trooper project.  Gameplay:  The gameplay is very straightforward as you clear levels by going to the end/objective. There are no Force powers, lightsabers, or Jedi. Point and shoot at baddies shooting back at you. Thankfully, there are no escort missions.  Graphics:  The game is from the 90's.  Sound/Music:  Enemies will grunt and scream/squeal as they are shot/blown apart/punched to death. Music is always superb from John Williams, although after a while, the music for the missions will continue to loop.  Controls:  By today's standards, in my opinion, the controls are not so good. You will have to use the arrow keys to move and with the mouse, you can only look left or right. To look up or down, you are forced to use the Home and End keys. There is a fix for this however, in the form of a file called 'Glovepie' which allows you to use your mouse to look in all directions.  Replay value:  There is little to no replay value as there are no achievements. I suppose if you want to run through the game by changing the difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard) you could play three times or start a playthrough with only fists.  Online:  None.  ---  ***If there are any mistakes to the facts pertaining to the game, please let me know.

This is pure old-school run-and-gun action with a Star Wars skin, and the beginning of the legendary Jedi Knight series.

The soundtrack features iMuse, which allows a varying soundtrack that changes depending on what is going on. Even for a 1995 game, it still impresses me, and it is one of the first games I have ever played in my life. It's also a bit scary, from sewer monsters to giant kell dragons to hovering black balls of painful 'British Made' syringes and torment. Also, thermal detonators: have fun with those, raise lots of hell.",

            "review_text": "I LOOOOOVED this game in 1995. It was the first thing I bought with my first paycheck when I turned 16 that year. I love star wars, and I love doom. Except this game had a better plot, cutscenes to support it, and some nifty tricks like jumping, crouching, and looking up and down. Due to the last of those, the level design is genius! You really have to explore, as keys are often hidden in little side areas rather than be guarded by groups of MOBs. Back then it looked amazing, although 20 years later not as much. Although, the graphics are really not all that necessary, as those mid 90's FPS's are all about gameplay and level design. I miss this. I cannot stand FPS games where basic enemies are bullet sponges. I get bored if I have to put 8 or more rounds in every basic enemy. These games are more 'realistic' in the fact that you can clear the guards out of an area to perform your espionage, with a few well placed blaster rounds. Only droids and hearty aliens like Gamorreans. You may even get to punch a Kell Dragon to death ;).   The introduction of Kyle Katarn and the whole Jedi Knight series does not play like the followups. He is not a jedi, and you get no lightsaber. However, at this time period in Star Wars lore, the amount of Jedi is down to a couple tops, including a couple geriatrics and a 19 year old kid. Getting to play a part in the rebellion to help dismantle the Empire is pretty cool for any Star Wars fan, and the gameplay will satisfy any retro FPS fan.   I do recommend looking into the XL engine. It is a free fan made sourceport, currently in alpha. It runs the game pretty well, and makes it much easier on a modern gamer. Full mouselook, right click to use, and an overall refresh of the graphics. Just textures, no new models or anything, but since the Jedi engine is not released, the guy had to build a new engine.",

The story, while a bit bland by todays standards, went above and beyond most stuff from the era (Although it should be noted it's no longer considered canon for reasons unknown to me). The game features several weapons, most of which are really enjoyable to use.   Honestly the biggest flaw of the game is that it's a bit short, barring some issues I will get to in a bit. Also if you are a younger gamer, the archaic design of the game may at times confuse you, definitly go look up a guide to find or change the controls. Fans of older FPS and star wars should definitly check it out (Although you probably already have).   However... Whoever put this on steam didn't try very hard, it is running on a old version of dosbox and has very very poor default settings. It will run right off the bat, but you will really want to go check out some guides on updating dosbox and changing the settings to something that makes more sense. I haven't checked GoG for this game, but I'd assume they also sell it and they probably have it set up and optimized much better, just something to consider.  tl:dr : Steam version is set up poorly by default, it's a great game though.",

Pros:  It has all of the good traits that Doom Clones have, such as no cover, more than two weapon slots, and non-linear maps.  The gunplay feels solid and gunning down enemies is satisfying.  The story is pretty good for a FPS released only a year and a few months after Doom II. It involves really good voice acting for the time period and some cut scenes that I imagine looked pretty good in 1995 but now have a certain retro charm to them.  The soundtrack really makes the most of it's MIDI music, and most of the songs still hold up today, especially the opening song. Unless you don't like MIDI music, in which case you probably won't like this game's music.  The environment is well designed, and does a good job capturing the feel of wherever the level is supposed to be set. This is an area that I always thought that Doom I and II frequently fell short, so this is rather big deal.  Cons   This is a FPS with LIMITED LIVES. You get three in the beginning, and you can find more hidden in the levels. This 'feature' is definitely going to make a few people not interested in this game anymore, but it isn't as big of a deal as it sounds.  You can't save your game mid-level. Even Wolfenstein 3D had that feature, and it also had limited lives, so I can't see why they didn't put that in this game.   As with many early Doom Clones/FPSs, to aim up and down, you have to press Page Up and Page Down. However when you aim at an enemy on a higher level than you are aiming, the game automatically detects that you are aiming at the enemy and your blaster shots automatically aim up. Sometimes this works, sometimes it doesn't. However, this isn't that big of a deal in the end. Fortunately, the game supports mouse control for looking left and right.  Like other Doom Clones, the game is rather pixelated. However, you can use XL Engine (a source port of this game and several others) to fix this, as well as the aiming up/down issue.  Easily the biggest problem present in this game, as well as many other Doom Clones, is that the non-linear levels act as a double-edged sword. On one hand, it can be quite liberating to play a fairly non-linear FPS, as you aren't being pushed down a corridor like in Call of Duty. On the other hand, it can be difficult at times to figure out where you are supposed to go next. This can result in a frustrating 'Where do I go now?' feeling compounded by the fact that you usually aren't doing a lot of shooting while looking where to go next.   Bottom Line  If you are searching for a retro FPS to wash the foul taste of today's ultra-linear FPSs, this is a game for you. If you like Star Wars, I can't recommend this game to you unless you also like retro first-person-shooters. Honestly, this type of game is rather dated in some ways, so it isn't for everybody. But if you do like Star Wars and retro first-person shooters, you should buy this right now.

            "review_text": "Kyle Katarn and I stole the plans to the Death Star twenty years before Jyn Orso got there.  Like so many things associated with Star Wars, it's hard for me to not to have a view of Dark Forces that is not tinted with nostalgia but the recent release of Rogue One inspired me to revisit the game to see how well it held up.  Outside of Star Wars, the other main point of reference is, of course, Doom. A 1990s FPS was judged based on what it did well or poorly in comparison to the latest id game, to the extent that the genre was known as Doom-clones rather than first person shooters.  Dark Forces was a truly excellent Doom-clone.   Despite not having true 3D levels, the developers were able to hack together a system that gave the levels a verticality that Doom just didn't have. Rooms could be located on top of one another, and the result was anything from maze-like prison complexes built into cliffsides to simple things like gaps you could jump over and bridges you could walk both over and under. It was the kind of leap forward that sounds so trivial after it was done, it's hard to imagine games without it.   The improved technology would not have mattered if Dark Forces didn't feel like a Star Wars game though. iMuse was a system that dynamically mixed the music with the rise and fall of in-game action that had been used successfully in previous LucasArts games. As with X-Wing and TIE Fighter it sounded fantastic when applied to Star Wars themes. Voice acting and a handful of cutscenes let the game tell a simple but functional story, itself a somewhat innovative idea for a mid-90s FPS.  Is it worth playing outside of nostalgia or as a history lesson in FPS design? Many of the mechanics are simple by today's standards. Enemies shoot at you or walk around slightly aimlessly, and while there is a good range of weapons available to the player, the gunplay is very basic. Lives are used instead of a save or checkpoint system, which leads to an occasional need to restart the level when you fall to your death too many times or die against the handful of actually difficult enemies.   Ultimately though it's impressive that the game has aged as well as it has, and with the use of a graphics mod like DarkXL, it's still eminently playable.",
