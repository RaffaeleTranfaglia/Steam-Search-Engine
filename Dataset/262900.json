            "review_text": "Let me make one thing clear from the get-go: Smooth Operators is super difficult. It's a call center simulator which has so many balls to juggle, that you'll no doubt need to restart a few times before you finally get the balance right. People answering the calls, computers exploding, walls cracking, contracts to fulfil... and while it's all a bit overwhelming and ridiculous at times, there's something about it that really makes me want to crack on and keep trying. Overcoming Smooth Operators is quite the achievement, and it's sort of refreshing to play a management game that wants to destroy you constantly, rather than hand you a victory on a platter.  You can watch my quick playthrough here:         YouTube™ Video:  Let's Play: Smooth Operators&nbsp;",

            "review_text": "Great simulation/management game. You take control of and construct a call center while managing employees, workloads, clients and HR issues. Features and upgrades unlock as you progress and expand your business, and the workload can become a bit of a challenge if you're not careful with the layout and transportation of your office, along with your employees moods and scheduling.  + Fun and simplistic - quick and easy learning curve  + Soundtrack you can tap your foot and whistle to + Unlocking achievements grants a cash bonus (which usually hits right when you need it)  + Offices can be built up to 40 floors high + IT staff fixes PCs the way I'd like to 'fix' mine + Most dedicated receptionists ever  - Menus would benefit from sortable columns when evaluating employees, along with viewable past reports; would be nice to schedule/educate employees by building - Can't zoom out wide enough to see entire building - Adam Demamp, Blake Henderson and Anders Holmvik not included  Overall, this is probably the best deal among the sim/tycoon genre on steam.   8/10",

            "review_text": "Addictive little game that had me remembering the good old days of SimTower, but doesn't really advance it any further. The first few days of the game tend to suffer a bit from the railroading forced on you by 'unlocks', and it took me several attempts before latching on to a somewhat decent plan of progression. There are a few rough edges (can't keyboard-control speed when a message is on the screen, and some of the UI is a bit dodgy) but it's not often I get a new game before lunch and suddenly find out that it's 2AM in the morning when I next look up.",

But this one the gameplay is GREAT, the graphics are very nice, and the controlls and interface is pretty easy to understand, but one issue I have trumps everything else, the game doesn't save. Now, I'm not seeing many other people with this with problem, but after a big update, nothing would save, which sucks. I was really loving the game. But this could just be a bug on my client end and may be working just fine for everyone else, if this is so, you only have $3 to lose, but definitly give it a try incase it really does work. Like a said, I would give this game a 10/10 for gameplay, but the saving issue trumps that in my opinion. I hope this is just an issue for me. ----------------------------------------------------------------  I really love this game, as you probably read above. I was having some issues, but re-installing seemed to fix the problem. Definately worth the money if you enjoy this job area, if you don't find call centers very interesting, it may not be the game for you. 10/10",

I liked the sounds, the graphics, the management game play. I made it to almost 200 days and then I started over.  This is a cool little game that some will like but most will pass on.",

            "review_text": "Someone once asked, 'Whats the least amount of work I can do for a game and still get paid.' This is the final result.  The unlocking system in this game is unproductive. The first people unlocked are entirely based on how many days have passed. You won't get the janitor until after the second day, which leaves the office dirty the entire second day and makes employees unhappy. You won't unlock the Coaches (Employees that make others happy) until happyness because a problem. When you finally unlock the employee that unlocks other items you'll find that even 5 offices full of them have a rediculously slow research speed.  This game has a very vague information system. An employee will quit, why? 'My dog is lonely at home' or 'My sports team wins when I watch them at home.' Very rarely will you find an excuse related to something they might have actually hated, like elevator queue times or Managers dragging down their morale. There is no research time table for unlocking items, you will never know when the next item will be unlocked or if you need more researchers.  Starting out in this game is very difficult. You are given a client without any option of choice and the number of calls they want done is realistically not possible. Even with 20k it is very hard to get the number of officies and employees to take all the calls. If you spend all your money trying to make this happen you will not have enough money to buy the offices or Janitors and IT techs when you really need them. On top of this, you will not get an elevator upgrade for a very long time, this causes an unhappiness black hole and you will see employees quit left and right, causing more financial ruin. Janitors are the most laughable programming when they come to their job too. They will stop cleaning a desk to use the restroom, they then return to their home desk before returning to the desk they were cleaning.  If you want to play a game like this, just look up Corporate Inc. a free flash game which Smooth Operators was clearly based on and save yourself $3.",
