            "review_text": "Along with Sid Meier's Civilization, this is among of my favorite strategy games of the early-to-mid 90's, and I'm delighted to see it on Steam. While the game may seem dated or boring to some, there's a lot of freedom to play the game the way you see fit. Want to be a mostly peaceful trader? Attack natives and/or other European powers to expand as far and wide as possible? Revolt against the monarchy and declare independence? Some combination of the above? Go for it.  Yes, this game runs in DOSBox. If that's a problem for you, or if the graphics prevent you from wanting to play, FreeCol or Civilization IV: Colonization might be better alternatives. Nostalgia always draws me back to the original, but I understand this game shows its age and might not be for everyone. If you do give it a shot, be sure to reference the player guide and the in-game Colonizopedia,.. otherwise at least pay attention to the help screens and try to figure it out on your own. Happy colonizing!",

ALSO the game comes with an ISO that has a ♥♥♥♥ing Windows 98-compatible version of Colonization for Windows, which is virtually the same game but with much higher resolution graphics and CD audio soundtrack. For this alone, I cannot recommend this enough, what a stellar release.",

The unique challenge posed in this game, the one of actually declaring your independance and fighting for it, is a challenge indeed. There never seems to be enough of everything to go around, so learning to make do with a shoe-string effort seems to be the norm. I have supremely fond memories of the game and I'm glad to say the game has held up to those all these years later. Warning: prepare to find yourself humming songs from the game for the next few years.",

I cannot tell you how much fun and how many hours we played this game, and here it is in it's entirity. Have to adjust resolution because as with most old DOS games, it's too grainy to play and enjoy above 800 res, but this is a classic properly brought back to life on Steam. In the common folder for the game is the maual which will make playing much more comfortable. At the sale price, it was a buy. Thanks steam, fond memories. worth playing again.",
