            "review_text": "Not an awfully bad game, but too limited in my opinion. - only three unit types - pincer moves are not possible, since you can only 'activate' one sector at a time;  - flanking movements are pretty useless, since enemies don't care about being threatened from the rear or flanks, unless a supply line is in danger - tactical retreats are not possible; once in a contested sector, you are forced to duke it out, sometimes for several turns on end, so your units could be stuck there for the rest of the game - strict time limit, no possibility to switch off the timer that ends the game  - they say the A.I. is smart, but I cannot confirm that beyond doubt;  When playing the Allies, the A.I. set up a good defense, but when I shifted sides and let the A.I. play the attacking Germans, it didn't go all that well. The German A.I. started off good, but once I blocked every possible route of advance, the A.I. didn't know what to do anymore. It started moving around units without purpose, moving them to one place and then moving them back again. At first it seemed like some sort of a plan to prepare a breakthrough, but nothing like that happened. I waited for an attack to happen, passing every turn to him, but the A.I. wouldn't engage, wouldn't attack anymore, and kept shifting units up and down the line without any apparent plan or idea what to do. After minutes of fooling around, the game finally crashed, saving the A.I. a humiliating defeat.   - It also looks like they made the Bastogne sector A.I. especially resilient against german attacks; no matter how overwhelming the odds, somehow the attacking Germans in the Bastogne sector always seem to miss their targets, making the defenders turn out extremely tough. 'American heroism' is probably the best explanation for this phenomenon.  there are some positive points, like nice graphics, easy-to-understand game mechanics, and effective menus, but still not enough to really recommend this game",

            "review_text": "I usually only write reviews when I have something to say that it seems that everyone else is leaving out of their reviews. In the case of this game, nobody is pointing out that this game is NOT a realistic simulation of a World War II battle. It is not even close to a realistic simulation. I recommend this game only because it is a good strategy game, the same as I would recommend chess to someone, but this is not a World War II battle simulation. I played other war games on my main steam account that are accurate and realistic when it comes to World War II battles, but this game is not even close.   For one thing, you can only move units from ONE region a turn which is totally unrealistic. It is impossible to do multiple battles across multiple regions, which is what would occur in real life. They had radio communication in 1945 and they could communicate and plan simultaneous attacks on multiple fronts in those days. Or even the individual commanders of each unit may of decided by chance, to attack at the same time as someone else. Not being able to have simultaneous battles originating from multiple regions is totally unrealistic in this game and makes this game as far from a realistic World War II battle simulation as you can get.  A different reviewer pointed out that it makes the game more strategic and makes you think more by having that feature (only being able to move units from one region per turn) and I do agree with him. But that reviewer neglected to point out how unrealistic it makes the game, and some buyers may be looking for a realistic simulation of a World War II battle. Personally I prefer this feature and like the fact it makes you think a lot about what units you want to move first in a day. Just to avoid confusion, you get enough turns in a day, that you are able to move all your units on the map. The thing this game does, is make you decide which units to move first. You can't move or attack from multiple regions at the same time. As I said, I recommend this game as a good strategy game. I just don't recommend it as a realistic simulation.  Another way this game is not realistic is it goes to unrealistic extremes on unit supply. In real life, units would receive supplies that would last a few days or even a week. They didn't receive supplies only for 1 day at a time, as far as I know. If a unit got stuck behind enemy lines, it could survive and fight back for atleast a week. It might have to ration its food and it might have to search the countryside for food, but it could survive and fight back for atleast a week. In this game, if a unit is cut off from supply for little over a day, it then becomes an 'isolated unit' and it is UNABLE to fight back. The unit just sits there when attacked and doesn't defend itself. That is a unit that was cut off from supply for just a little over a day. Makes absolutely no sense at all, is not historically accurate, and is not realistic. But again, it makes you think more having to worry about units becoming isolated and cut off from supply in the game, so while it makes the game totally unrealistic, it also makes it a better strategy game. I actually resigned after the first 3 days out of 8 days in a scenario against the computer AI in a game, where I selected Bradley as an opponent and played the endgame scenario, because the computer kept cutting off the supply lines for my units. My units weren't able to move and I was screwed, so I didn't see any point to continue, though I probably could of won the game due to the ridiculously little victory points needed to win. I usually set personally goals for myself in the game when playing against the computer to make things more interesting. But back on topic: This is a very fun game to play and is very challenging because of having to worry about keeping all your units in supply and not even losing supply for a single day. I think this is what the developers were aiming for, more strategy at the cost of realism.   I can go on about several other ways this game is unrealistic, but one of the big ones is the calendar. You can look at the calendar and see a list of the exact dates when the enemy will receive reinforcements and the exact reinforcements they are getting is listed. How unrealistic can you get. This information should not be given to the player, or be available to the player. You should have no clue when and what reinforcements the enemy is getting, as you would in real life. But I think this game does it that way, to again make it more strategy oriented while it makes it totally unrealistic. You can plan ahead your moves and base them around what troops the enemy will be getting. There is also no fog of war, so you see all the reinforcements on the map. But this game is like chess, it is a good strategy board game, where you get to see all the pieces of your opponent at all times. So you can plan your moves around that, and I actually like the fact it does it.   So the question is do you care that the game is unrealistic, or do you care more that it is a good strategy game that is tough and requires a lot of thinking and planning? I recommend this game as a good strategy game, and other reviewers do the same. I am only pointing out, what all the other reviewers neglected to do, that the game is unrealistic, so those buyers who don't want a game like that will know in advance. I personally like this game a lot, I enjoy playing against the challenging computer AI, and once I get tired of playing against the computer AI then I will seek multiplayer opponents. This is a very nice strategy boardgame. It doesn't bother me that it is unrealistic, because it is a whole lot of fun and makes you think a lot when playing about your moves. As I hinted at in another paragraph, I set personal goals for myself when playing against the computer to make it more challenging. For example, if playing as the axis player, I may set a goal of getting a certain amount of victory points by a certain day and also having a certain number of units exit the map by that day. By setting difficult goals for myself, and considering myself as losing if I don't meet the goals, I made the game a lot more challenging and intersting to play. So a suggestion: Anyone who buys the game can do the same thing. Just use your imagination for personal goals to set, and don't cheat, if you can't achieve your personal goals then you lost so you have to resign. I thought of over a dozen possible personal goals to set in the game, to make the game more challenging. Anything you can imagine, can be a personal goal. Achieving a certain number of victory points by a certain day in a scenario, Acceptable losts (losing only a certain number of armor units and certain number of infantry units by the end of a scenario), Defeating a certain number of enemy units (certain number of armor units and a certain number of infantry units), Exiting the map with a certain number of units when playing as the axis player, Defeating a certain number of British units (those units are brown in color and stay to the west of the river until you are adjacent then they can move east), Preventing the axis player from gaining control of any space that gives victory points even for a single turn (if the axis player gains control for a single turn, then you have to resign because you lost), and so on. There are over a dozen and even more then that, possible personal goals you can set to make the game more challenging when playing against the computer.  I had one other suggestion. Most new players will play the tutorial, and that is useful but the tutorial leaves a lot of details out. So my suggestion is to take the time to read the manual and I'm not talking about the in-game manual. Go to the store page for the manual and read that one.",

            "review_text": "It's good. I got shown this at a friends place. Proceeded to then buy it on Steam for myself.   Just note this:   This is not a wargame per se, as soon as you can look beyond that, it becomes much better. For me, being a wargamer this was a hurdle. But once you figure out what it is it becomes a very deep experience.   So what is it then if not a wargame?   Well... It's a puzzle game. It is like a mix of 'area activation' euro style board games and a logic puzzler. The theme is more coincidental, but is a nice touch.   The game has two core concepts, one being the mentioned 'area activation', a mechanic often seen in trading style board games. It means that a sector of the board is 'activated' on your turn, and only that, so you may ONLY move units on that sector. All other units have to wait a following turn.   The second concept which is central to the game is the timeline. A unit may only move ONCE every sub-timeline (a day) then it may not move until many turns later (next day). This is where the puzzle thing happens.   For instance, in the first scenario, it is very little about winning over the enemy but a lot about logically figuring out how to reach a certain point in time, given the movement restrictions.   In multiplayer it is the same thing, with the game taking on more of an abstract view of the theme and more of a logic puzzle nature. Like how chess is about battlefield tactics, hence the pieces and move ranges, but it is so abstracted it instead is turned into a logic game of deduction. This is the same.   So wargamers should be aware of this, and instead see it as a thematic puzzle/board gaming hybrid with some great depth.   When you do that, it becomes VERY enjoyable in it's own right. The small history articles is a nice touch also.",
