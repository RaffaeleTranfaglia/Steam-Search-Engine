I'd love to see some licensing in the works to do some commercial tables done with the same attention to detail as timeshock! Very well done!",

            "review_text": "A VERY HARD TABLE TO MASTER. THIS HAS GOT TO BE THE MOST REAL LOOKING TABLE I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED. CONTROLS A SOLID AND CRISP. NO LAG OR DELAY ON CONTROL INPUT TO ACTION ON THE SCREEN. GREAT JOB! IF THEY COULD ONLY INVENT MORE FULLY REALIZED TABLES LIKE THIS. THAT WOULD BE AWESOME. THIS IS DEFINITELY A MUST HAVE FOR ANY PINBALL PLAYER EVEN IF IT IS ONLY THIS TABLE. ITS A LIL PRICEY BUT WITH EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO COMPLETE ON THIS TABLE, (WHICH WOULD TAKE A VERY LONG TIME TO MASTER IF AT ALL), ITS WORTH IT.",
