            "review_text": "TECHNICAL ISSUES: SCROLL DOWN FURTHER FOR GAME. Imagine you purchase a book that's 1,000 pages in length but you can't open it because you took off the price tag. Now imagine you put it back on, you can now open and read the book BUT pages 75 - 500 are blank pages. Yes folks this describes Dusk 12 perfectly.  Before you start the game you will get a window for all your options video, AA, shaders etc. Now if you touch anything and I mean ANYTHING even just moving it up one that's it you have screwed yourself and the game will not launch. Now let's say it does launch, think you're safe? Oh no. You want to hit escape to pause? Enjoy your frozen game. You want to skip a cutscene? Enjoy your game freeze.  Now if you dissable music AND cutscenes (video playback) and also install NVidia Legacy driver well then look at that you can play it, but what is the point of playing something where story points are blocked out? Well you could focus on what you get, but imagine in order to play Max Payne 3 you had to dissable loading scenes and cutscenes, you'd have no idea what the Hell just happened.   If you are running earlier then Windows 98 or newer then a Windows XP then that's it, no cutscenes to explain story and no music to set the mood, and having both of those off you will still wait to see if it'll even work or just freeze at a loading screen.  GAME. Now for the actual game. Dusk 12 has you controling 2 people, a mutant and a soldier. The setting is in a town that's been hit with something (but again we don't know because you are forced to dissable cutscenes.) Now, this is from a Russian company so all spoken lines are English dub overs (and we all know how bad those can be) so if you come in expecting anything other then cringe worthy then stay away.   The gunplay is standard, the progression is a little slow but the mutant powers are pretty good (night vision, health regeneration by draining life from enemies.) Gameplay it is simple point A to point B. Now if you've played any kind of Russian games you should know that the graphics are outdated, just look at this, this is from 2007 (released 2008.) The ragdolls are basic and the effects are nothing special. Overall I'd chalk it up to a no-frills standard shooter and a boring one at that. I'm not thumbing down because of the technical issues, I'm thumbing down because it's a boring game in general.",

            "review_text": "Awful game. Got it running with no audio but it wasn\\'t worth the effort. Terrible AI, ridiculous enemies that spaz around, generic shooting mechanics and constantly running out of ammo. The only thing I did like were the mutant powers but they were fairly limited. The \\'story\\' is ridiculous and the voice work is absurd. It\\'s definitely a very outdated game that I think would have been bad even back in 2002.",
