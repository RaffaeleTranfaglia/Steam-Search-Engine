It's very simple, getting all the achievements might take as little as 10-15 minutes if you approach it methodically (figure out a flow and the ball travel delay). Does it have lasting appeal or replay value? That depends, so before you buy, maybe watch my gameplay available  here . It's technically solid, with no bugs observed in the short time that I've played it. I will not be returning to it, but I admit it has a certain addictive quality, particularly if you'd want to challenge yourself by playing as quickly as possible instead of 'figuring out' each shot. The bottom line is, I +1'd my 'Perfect Games' counter in 15 minutes and for half a euro. That's a good deal.",

There wasn't really any bad things that I disliked about the game, but the i would like the music to be looped, whenever i would go on a long streak the music would end and i would be playing the game with silence.

The game was simple and fun at first, but then after 30 points are earned things get a bit challenging. The bar starts messing wtih your eyes and timing becomes a thing. But, there is a sweet spot, but only when the right sides of the sqaure are lit, then you will have to really angle it. It's idea is as simple as pong but a lot more fun. There are some fire tracks to listen to as you play. Overall, this game is just 'simple fun' with some old school machanics.",

I got it in a giveaway by the group listed as the developer, so I'm going to assume the sole purpose of this game was to be given away by this 'Free Games Info'. But that just begs the question: Why the hell are they trying to charge $1 for it?   This is nothing more than (what should be) a free mobile app. Don't get it.
