Not only that, but I mean how long have we been waiting for this free DLC that has missed its promised release date, what, 3 times now? Pretty sure its been going on for over a year. I'm under the impression that there's crap for organization and these developers have their priorities elsewhere. Don't buy this game at full price, wait until its on a 75% off sale if you want to get your moneys worth.  edit: If you do purchase the game don't get your hopes up.

            "review_text": "I've put more than sixty hours into this game and Contagion's gameplay design is fundamentally broken. I want it to be good, but it's not. This breaks my heart because I know that a team spent many many manhours trying to make this into a cool game. I really wish it was a proper successor to ZPS.   Coming from around a thousand hours in ZPS, I was attracted to Contagion's 'Escape' mode and I played this mode the most. There are other modes, but they are generally bland copycat 'afterthoughts' that are done better in other games. Escape is the only mode that enticed me to get Contagion.   However, Escape has numerous fundamental game design flaws that permanently gimp its gameplay. To illustrate, it's best to walk through a typical Escape game:      'Escape' generally begins as a co-op mode with up to around 8 teammates. Initially, you're playing against only NPC zombies. However, the NPC zombies are completely boring to fight against. You either have boring citizen zombies that die to a single headshot or you have uninspiring bullet-sponge riot-armor zombies. I couldn't find any engaging strategy to defeat these bullet-sponges except repeated shots to the noggin. Therefore, the NPC zombies are more of a chore to fight through.      Even though players soon find that the NPC zombies don't post much threat, the level design, itself, will kill them (either literally or figuratively):       There are simple 'no no' level design decisions like the the frequent use of ladders. Since Contagion is built on Source, ladders are horrific and will literally get players killed without any zombie involvement ( Even Valve wisely prefers to not use ladders in Source ). When I completed Camp Whitner for the first time, I was led through by an experienced player (see showstoppingly confusing level design below) and he literally stops at one point to say, 'Watch out, this ladder will kill you.' I knew how Source ladders worked and carefully navigated down the shaft. My other inexperienced teammate did not and was instakilled by fall damage. The experienced player obviously knew about the trouble from that stupidly unnecessary ladder. I'm not sure how the developers could have so much experience with Source dating back to ZPS in 2007 and still not know that ladders are terrible level design.      There are also situations where the macro-scale level design pathing is so bad on certain maps that new players will just quit out of frustration. Maps like Barlow Square on Escape prematurely appear like easy-to-navigate 'sandbox' urban 'city' maps (awesome! right?). So at first you might go, 'oh cool, that gun shop is a couple blocks west of our position. Let's make our way in that direction!' However, you have ZERO navigational liberty and you are FORCED onto a 100% LINEAR path due to miles of chainlink fence that procedurally block every path except ONE. This might only be 'bad', but it moves to 'terrible' when you find out that the dynamic path is often obscurred and basically hidden. If you are a new player that isn't aware that there's exactly one path to move through the map, then you will quickly get confused, then frustrated, then you'll quit. This happens on a painfully regular basis. The zombies don't end their fun - it's the map's level design that does that.      Furthermore, there are  micro-scale  level design issues. The latest example is one that I just experienced this morning.  I was trying to beat Montclair with some equally inexperienced players and we got to a military medical base in a park. After easily clearing it of boring NPC zombies, we walked past a locked gate and we were told to go find the key in the park. We didn't know what this 'key' looked like, but we combed the park nevertheless. We came up with nothing, yet we kept looking for what felt like hours. It got so desparate that the player-controlled zombie started trying to help us find it. Eventually my only living partner turned into a zombie as a result of a random bite and I just quit to end that pitiful match. This is one example of how needlessly frustrating this game is. Stuff like this is simply unfun.        But if you manage to get through all of those inherent level design flaws, then you'll notice that player-controlled zombies are frighteningly unbalanced. It gets so bad, that some experienced players intentionally die at the beginning of the match just so they can single-handedly destroy their former teammates before they can even get through the first couple objectives. How in the world can it be so unbalanced?      It's almost impossible to hit a player zombie as compared to an identical NPC zombie. I've heard players claim that player zombies have unique hitboxes. My hunch is that the game has poor networking and it's normally masked by allowing NPC zombie hits to be credited only clientside (versus player zombie hits that must be validated serverside). Either way, this is a very very very noticeable phenomena and it makes player zombies very difficult to deal with.      Oh and player zombies can 'dodge' as well. The experienced ones know that if their head stays unscathed, then they can tear through a group of players, so they spin, duck, jump and do all sorts of stupid moves to turn themselves into a walking killing machine. That's not fun. This is not a featured capability. There's no tooltips or tutorials that explain all of the intricacies of this maneuvering. That tells me that it isn't a designed feature. And since it ruins entire Escape servers, I say it's an exploit that is unpatched two years after release.       I really drive home hard enough that this is a frustrating game to play. If I hadn't dropped a thousand hours in ZPS, I would've abandoned it long ago. This game does not play like ZPS. It's something much much worse and that breaks my heart.",

There's clearly money and effort put into everything in this to try to elevate it above being a source mod, but none of that matters if the core gameplay is bad. Popping zombies in the head with your pistol is fun for a while, and tense as it's not easy but I am being serious when I say there is nothing else there to the gameplay.  Guns are scarce to a point where you more luck into a playstyle than you do choose how you want to play or adapt to what's going on. However, ammo is plentiful and melee weapons are so dangerous and inconsistent they are useless.  There's a barricade tool, but it's only useable for certain areas and useless the rest of the time.  There's cool ideas, but none of them are implemented well. Not one.   I have played an ♥♥♥-ton of zombie games looking for good ones and I want this one to be good. But jesus christ the devs have been asses on the forums, the game has only gotten limited support since release and it doesn't look like it will be turning around any time soon.  Go play Zombie Panic: Source or No More Room in Hell. Both are better and free.  Somehow No More Room in Hell comes out feeling more polished, despite this having a budget.   If you really want to defend this game, you can talk to me in the commments, but jesus christ I have no idea how you sado-masochists do it.  It's not that fun, it's not scary and it's not scary enough to justify the core gameplay not being fun.",

            "review_text": "Contagion is going on the right way for a FPS zombie survival game. From the same founder of ZPS, it's worth to try out this COOP game, even better with friends! One free DLC is coming soon and will bring good improvements to the game. Currently with 5 game-modes (Objective; PVP; Coop Extraction and two familiars from ZPS) and 8 different type of characters to choose; including more than 12 types of weapons.  The maps are pretty well made and I known for sure it takes time to create a master piece like that, each rounds the objective and other paths can change on the area, doors can be locked and you must find another way etc. You must walk around to find the items to unlock the paths and complete the mission to escape and win.  For now, I recommend to play this game with friends, you can check out some populated PVP/Objective servers; but for a first try, you should do 'objective' to train your aim and see all the commands for your first experience.  TL;DR  Good co-op game (8 players and pvp servers with 16); free DLC coming in January 2015 with good improvements on the game-play; new animations, weapons and characters and future Linux support! Recommend to play with friends and truly worth it to buy in this price (75% off).  Have fun!",

Graphics are generally smooth, there is a small choice of weapons that can be very glitchy at times, players like to troll by becoming a zombie, inconsistent nerfing of zombies, and much more.   Overall, besides the levels being somewhat random in the pathing, there is nothing else you will be missing here.

I got it on sale, and it's given me about 20 hours of moderate fun, so I'd say I'm satisfied. Don't pay any more than $5 for this.  Pros: - It's fun to shoot zombies - The Sig Sauer is really fun - The flashlight looks great - Boarding up a house and then shooting zombies through doors is really cool - Big levels  Cons: - Zombies are only really affected by headshots. Contagion prides itself on being more realistic, but a .45 ACP to the chest will slow anything down - as it is, anything other than a headshot is wasted ammunition. - Guns sound bland, except for the Sig Sauer. I really wish game developers would take field trips to gun ranges to hear what guns actually sound like, rather than just relying on movies. - Too much bullet spread. If guns were as inaccurate as they are in this game, nobody would use them. I pointed a rifle at a wall about 20 meters away, didn't move the mouse, and fired five times, waiting enough time in between each shot for the rifle to settle down again. I checked the wall and there were five different bulletholes. At 20 meters, you should be able to put a round in the same place all day long. - It isn't cognitively demanding at all. If you try to take it slow and be smart, you'll be disappointed, as every encounter ends up being a non-stop headshot fest.  Overall, I think they could've done better. It feels like it's in Early Access, or something that might have once appeared on XBox Live Arcade. Underwhelming stuff.",

Contagion focus it self on cooperative gameplay, management of resources (weapons and ammo), map exploration in order to find those resources and find a one of the three randomly generated scape routes. The gameplay is a 'relistic' survival zombie game, were only head shots kills zombies, attacks from them cause infection and ammo is littely found. The problem is, the game has bugs since it early access like zombie pathfinding, charcters skeletons, animations..., there is no lobby and kick system, to play multiplayer with your friends only you must have your own server, there is only a few maps to play and to make it worst there is no modding community fix that. There characters are lifeless and boring, they only swear bad words and that's it. L4D is FAR MUCH BETTER in that aspect and also in the maps. Contagion has good mechanics, but L4D has better characters, better maps and better modding support. A great zombie game would be the mix of these two games OR a remastered first person edition of Resident Evil Outbreak.",

So heres my conclusion, these are my pros and cons about this game:  + Its a spiritual sucesor to ZPS, so you can feel it has a little bit of it, it even has a Panic gamemode which tries to be faithful to the original mod + Hunted mode is the gamemode that i spent a lot of time playing it back then + I like games that needs cooperation, and the matches i have been back then i encountered with people that was very communicative with the players and started helping each other.  - Now theres no activity on the servers, looks like the game is already dead. - Flatline mode needs some fixes, like other stuff in the game. - I have experienced some bad optimizations on the framerate on other pc's/laptops  Well, if you liked ZPS you definetly need this game, but i suggest you to organize a match with some friends because its rarely to find a server full of people to play with.",

The game could be a good one and worth the money if it had more maps, more gamemodes, more weapons, more zombie variations and better music for background, weapons, environment and zombies.  The game also lacks any form of character customization. If you are not going to put that freedom in a survival game then atleast build up a nice storyline around the present characters maybe even with their own pro's and con's.  beside all this the game can be fun for a little while when played with friends but eventually (around 1- 3 hours) it's get really boring and you know any bush and tree in this game. My message to the creators: - make improvements to the sounds in this game - try to add 4-8 new zombie models (atleast), more is always better - Add new weapons and ways to modify them - more maps, play with heights like walkways and tunnels. make a scary shipyard with huge rusted boats. make a map that you are inside a giant mall with several floors with shop you can go into and small rooms in the back ect. - more game modes. if you make it fun to have several things to do you will automatically play a game much longer, its that simple. there are ALOT of modes you could think up that would fit this kind of game.  overall score (5 stars max): 2 out of 5 stars  I hope they will keep working on it and will add in new stuff to make the game better and worth the cost of the game.

The slightly slower pacing compared to a run-n-gun zombie shoot-em-up is refreshing as you have to actually scavenge for your ammo and supplies and, especially on harder modes, conserve as much as you can.  If you like cooperative play like I do, the escape and extraction modes are fun, especially if you find a good group of people. In escape, you have to navigate a level with some objectives and obstacles that rotate through a couple different scenarios, and in extraction you locate NPC survivors, hold out for a time against hordes, and then escort them to a drop off point. As with any online game, you will probably get in several games with people that aren't as cooperative or skilled, but when you have a good team it's very fun.  If you favor competitive play, there's always hunted and panic modes. Hunted is your basic pvp, where players killed become zombies and when there's two left, all NPC zombies charge at the two remaining players. In Panic, one player begins the game infected but may not know it for a few minutes, and the only zombies in the level are the player zombies, while the first player zombie respawns as a SWAT zombie. Human players have to kill the zombies a certain number of times, or survive for like 20-30 minutes to win. All in all, I got the game on sale for $5, and I would say it's the best 5 I've spent in a long time. Yes, some graphics aren't as up-to-date and some animations can be wonky, but it's not distracting to me at all.

I mostly played the Hunted mode because i enjoyed it the most. Hunted mode is where you go around and try and kill other survivors. If you die then you become a running zombie and try and hunt other survivors. But as soon as it comes down to the last few survivors, it becomes a game of hide and seek. which on a very large map can get very annoying.   I found some glitch spots where you can not get hit from zombies and stay hidden throughout the match. Even some hidden spots where the zombies night vision cant see you.  I find that people who start with a SIG than the 1911 have the advantage becuase of the longer clip size and that finding ammo for the SIG is easier than the 1911...or maybe i just suck with the 1911  There isn't many maps on this game. Even though the items and map changes a bit each round. I find that it isn't enough for a game that costs around £15.   its an okay game but It just needs some fixes and more content. If you're a zombie lover then you'll proberly like this, but i'd give it a miss.",

            "review_text": "Contagion is a wonderful game, but there are some disadvantages that are sort of disapointing :/.   #1(Disadvantage:Zombies in Hunted Mode)When you really just want to play with your friends on random maps like with the 'Hunted'mode, it can be fun but dayum it gets really, REALLY annoying. Zombies are actually the annoying ones because they're just everywhere, plus with just one gunshot you attract almost every zombie in the area. If there was a mod that would remove them(zombies)the game would be amazing so then the plaers wouldn't have to worry about zombies killing them.  #1(Advantage:Zombies in Hunted Mode)When you get killed as a Survivor you turn into a zombie, the undead can climb walls, roar to basically call other zombies, and attack survivors from behind which if completed to do that the survivor that has been biten will then turn into a zombie in a short but long amount of time. Anyways if there were any players(survivors) camping somewhere, the zombies could attack them killing the survivors so then no one else would have to wait a long time to become a survivor(Every round everybody becomes a survivor just a fyi). But still ZOMBIES ARE JERKS!  #2(Disadvantage:LAG)Frag not Lag is a fricken lie for this game so don't believe it -.-. You absolutly have to change the texture settings to medium. If you don't have to do that and can be kept on high with barely any lag, then you my unknown friend is lucky!  #2(Advantage:LAG)I HAVE NO IDEA! Or probably you can get past crap easily with less things being able to hit you.  #3(Disadvantage:Ring Ring PICK UP THE LOUD RINGTONE!) Okay, in the settings it gives you a choice to what type of ringtone you want. SADLY, all the ringtones are loud and can attract survivors that want to kill you, or zombies that want to eat your flesh. Vibrate is the best one cause it's quieter and doesn't have a long 'tone'.  #3(Advantage:Ring Ring, Troll Ring)Ifyou want to troll keep using the loud ringtones, it'll attract players to come to you and zombies. If you know that you wont be able to take down a player cause they're camping somewhere, do a few gunshots and use the ringtone. The stupid thing about that is that the zombies will be coming for both of ya'll. The ringtones can also tell you where other players are by listening for the tone. But warning they cann also call you!  IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS OR OPINIONS JUST TELL ME :3, sorry if you didn't like the review or thought I didn't type enough but hey I just felt like reviewing something.  ",

Hunted - S vs S based mode with Player Zombies aswell. You spawn in a random location on the map, and your objective is to stay alive the longest. Scavenge the abandoned houses along the way, but beware - hitting B as a human brings up your phone, and you and other players can see who is close aswell as get a buzzing noise when hitting the trigger. If you die you will respawn as a zombie and your only task is to bring down the remaining survivors. Last survivor alive wins the round.  Escape - Band together with friends and strangers in this Survivor vs AI / PC zombies. Your phone will let you know what objective you need to accomplish and your main goal is to escape from the map. Weapons, ammo and items will be found along the way. Make sure you check every corner as they are sometimes hidden or you need to progress further to unlock the areas they are in.  Extraction - Survivor vs AI / PC zombies where your goal is to follow the GPS on your map and find survivors held up in houses. Once you reach a holdout point, vast amounts of zombies will begin spawning, so share your ammo and your weapons with your friends, as each member of your team that gets killed will come back as one of the ravenous corpses coming to eat you. Round ends when all survivor packs have been extracted, or the zombies kill either all Player survivors or NPC survivors in a pack.  Panic (Objective) - The P:O mode was taken from the spiritual prequel Zombie Panic! Source, another game worth picking up as it's free, and features a strictly PS vs PZ combat zone, where the survivors need to complete the objectives much like in Escape.  Panic (Classic) The original game mode from ZP!S which just like the Objective mode features only player combat. Survive the zombie rush. Zombies have limited lives and the first player to turn becomes the strong Riot Zombie.  Happy hunting and good luck surviving!",

The Riot Cop Zombies are a horrible unbalanced addition to an otherwise fun game. Second Update to Review: After a fairly long absence of playing Contagion and a number of updates / fixes later, I figured I would give it a try. Every single annoyance / unbalanced issue I had with the game remains unchanged. Not sure what all they've been working on, but it's still a horribly broken mess. They are releasing the new free DLC with even more fixes / updates. I may give it another go, but it'll probably be a while.",

Source, It was my favorite steam game, I've played years of it and when I heard about Contagion I got super excited for it.  In the weekend they put the game for a free weekend and on deal, I played the trial and fell in love with it, After a while I bought the game and I'm not dissapointed, A big thank and congratulations to the developers for making such a great game.  This game is similar to Zombie Panic! Source so you'll get almost no problems with understanding the game's gameplay.  So basically there are various gamemodes and maps, Each map with it's own objectives and each mode with it's own point.  For a start I would suggest trying out ce_losmuertos (Escape : Los Muertos)  From what I can tell it's the easiest map out there.  Talking about the game, You at the start are a survivor, And there are other zombies/infected that are out there trying to stop you, There are many actions that you can do when you are a survivor or a zombie, Which is great and balanced.  The game has some realism, So you'll get tired after sprinting (Yes theres sprinting!) for a while, Jumping and you have no crosshair, So iron sights are a very useful thing here.  For zombies you can roar, Use your zombie vision, Blend (Activate a CPU to play for you) and command other zombies.  If you think you'll let zombies hit you and you'll be fine you're wrong, Because theres infection!  I really love these kind of games, So it's a 5 out of 5.",

It allowed for a lot of fun memories with people who just wanted to have a good time. I never seen that in contagion. No one in contagion ever seemed friendly at all. Even their ZPS classic mode in contagion didn't add up. It has nothing to do with ZPS. The only thing that is even similar is just the carrier roar and even then, it's not the same. Stupid.  I just hate how this game killed an already amazing game. I know a lot of people seem to enjoy overly realistic games, but for me, games are supposed to be an escape from reality.

            "review_text": "The main game mode is called escape and sees up to 8 players try to work their way through a map full of zombies to escape a situation. The puzzles are pretty basic and usually involve finding an item to open a door or barrier. Each time you play the game the route changes, keys change location, different doors are unlockable/open, one game saw the team using vents to get around the map instead of taking the stairs. The zombies are easy enough to kill but a lack of ammo and limit to the number of things you can hold means that you often resort to using risky melee weapons. The limits on holding 5 things at once mean that through the game you do things such as swap a key for machine gun with no ammo(in the hope you will find ammo) only to find that the armory later in the game is locked..   Deathmatch sees up to 8 players battling it out on medium sized maps filled with zombies. While not strong the zombies are a great addition to the fight. The match is slow paced and it can be quite hard to find other human players, following a hoard who can smell human blood is a great way to track people down. Other ways to find humans include following flashlights, which works great when you see a small flash in the front room of the house next door or following gunshots. Gunshots is a great idea by the developers because at some point human players find themselves cornered in a loft with a zombie they need to take out; unfortunately, unless you have 5.1 sound its unlikely to help locate people that much.   I should point out the game is beta, so there is plenty of time for things to change. I don’t know how being a zombie can be more fun while not making them too powerful for humans. While it takes a while to hunt a human player down in escape mode, this stops the humans getting overran by 5 zombie players. I should also note that while being a zombie was a tad boring, playing as a human was really fun. It was also really tense, death actually meant something to the player and kept you on your toes.  I’m giving this 4.5 stars because I’m knowingly taking part in a beta. Perhaps I would give it 3.5 if this was the finished product, but it’s not. Reviewing games at this stage in their life is perhaps a little unfair, but I think its good giving games trying something new and following the kickstarter/green light/beta business models as much coverage as possible.   4.5/5 stars :D ",

You have many game modes, you have many weapons to grab, tools to use, there is a variety of zombies, it's graphically superior to many other games, and it's a challenge to anybody who wants to play a zombie game and doesn't want to be bothered by a-holes ruining the games, like they do in other zombie games I could mention (but I won't, you already know of which I'm talking about).  You shoot the zombies to the brain and the brain explodes, you see the bullet coming out of their head exactly where it should, and it's awesome. You need to take care and not waste your ammo because there's few and it's a valuable and scarce resource; same goes with medkits.  There are currently three game modes, one in which you must escape a facility carrying on a number of tasks, another where you need to evacuate a neighbourhood before it gets overwhelmed (and you must hold position barricading and such) and a game called 'hunt' made for PVP combat. The first two are cooperative, although there is friendly fire so look where you shoot. The last one is a free for all deathmatch; the last man standing wins.  Although there are few maps at the time, you can see they are very detailed and won't get bored so easily as there is also a script which randomizes each game making it feel fresh, changing everything from weapon spawns to open hallways and houses.  All in all and even though it's early access this game is a gem and if you're into zombie shooters you should give it a test drive because it may be just what you were looking for.",

The levels suffle different paths and weapon placements each game (This game could use some extra weapon and items scattered around) The downside i see is the zombie gameplay. Playing as a zombie is really boring and quite under powered. Most players turn around often so it make it difficult to sneak up on some players and most users that turn into a zombie just remain afk until the game ends. And the ability to command AI zombies seems pointless to me.  Still a great game, worth the buy.",

Needs unlockables, maybe new weapon loadouts, perhaps a character leveling system that makes people better at using specific weapons/items - or a medic class. Also...Hunt mode needs a feature where player zombies can always 'smell' or sense where the human players are. Otherwise it just devolves into a guy playing hide and seek for 10 minutes while everyone else shuffles around in the street.   I recommend it but wait till it comes on sale again and pick it up.

Most of the people that are down rating the game prefer the big blockbuster titles such as Dead Island or Killing Floor they are into gore skill trees or rpg styled zombie games.  This game is the second genre I spoke of. Very fun to play with freinds mild pace scavange / objective style game play with random generated maps. If you cant find ammo your pretty much dead using mele wepons is somthing you should avoid everytime you get hit by an infected there is a chance you will be bitten and die only to return as a zombie and then hunt your freinds. A neat feature you have as a zed is you can see human foot prints and roar to have a squad of 15 zombies rally to you and fight for you. Now we move on to the Guns let me tell you about guns in this game. They did a very good job on the wepons in this game the look good and fire like the real deal there is also no stupid aim assist or anything of the sorts I also forgot to warn you of your flash light the zeds can see it and tred lightly they hear you also and will find and eat you.",

Very fun with friends, actually with friends is recommended. Sadly, I have a VERY hard time by myself. A shame, seeing how easy it was to play singleplayer. While playing, things would not spawn, mainly the keys in the beginning of the Escape level. I would be running between the two security rooms for almost an hour not finding any keys. Seeing how everything is in different places with every game, it felt like the spawns went a little crazy, felt like the whole mission was broken. With Extraction, the game is rather impossible to complete. (for a new player to the game like me) This game seemed like I HAD to play with other people in order for the game to WORK.   That being said, the graphics are very impressive and the zombie hit boxes are surprisenly well done. The random spawns are always fun when first playing, but again, they need to WORK so people may proceed with the mission. Instead of randomly generating EVERYTHING, maybe keep key items in the same room but in a different area. Seriously, I have to restart an escape mission 3 different times just so I could find the damn KEYS! I'm sure I am just not searching hard enough but I think looking for about an hour enough to say that the items are a little broken when being placed.   Very good game, fustratingly hard, broken feel, but stil worth it. Hope you guys fix the bugs for singleplayer so people who like playing alone be able to play instead of punishing them by making them play with others. But again, in Beta so I am hoping they can fix the mistakes and I really like the game.",

            "review_text": "3.5/5 game I figured I would give this game a chance since it was up for free for the weekend. Now, I'm a big fan of killing zombies, I rarely get tired of putting a shot or a axe in the skull of a zombie. With this in mind, I like what Contagion is, but there are things about it I'm not too crazy about it. Before I go about posting what I think is great about the game, I will start with the things I'm not too crazy about.  1. Forgettable characters - Aside from picking the character you like, that is really about all there is to character selection. There just isn't anything that makes you remember the character beyond it's appearance.  2. Lack of a story - Now I know the game isn't a RPG or anything, but a little bit of story would be nice. Matter of fact it would be a nice way for the character's to be rememberable.  3. Flashlight needs work - Now the flashlight is very handy and by no means am I saying it's useless. However, why can the flashlight not light up rooms? It just seems to light up a small area and jeebus don't get too close to anything in particular with it. The light at the center can just about block out the view of items. You cannot even light up a room for a fellow survivor whose weapon doesn't allow a flashlight fitting.  4. Lack of Zombie variations - Aside from the standard Zombie, player Zombie, and Riot armored zombie. There really isn't anything else of danger around. A Zombie dog would have been a great addition to this game, or even enviromental hazards like falling buildings, out of control cars crashing, or something. A well organized team can easily put down a army of zombies, unless of course they're out of ammo.  5. Ammo hoarders - Don't get me wrong, when you need ammo badly, you need it badly. However, there are people that will pick up ammo for every gun BUT the gun they actually have. I cannot tell you how many times I've been down to one bullet and cannot even get a person to throw a magazine or ammo box my way.  6. Terrible Iron Sights - Now you don't need to serve a tour of duty in a war to tell some of these weapons have terrible iron sights. I've had times where I've woundered if it was easier to shoot from the hip or just aim down sights. Obviously it's better to aim down the sights, but some weapons just have such terrible iron sights it renders players ineffective at times. However, if you get use to the iron sights, you can easily work your way around their terrible design. Out of all the guns, your best bets are on the Pistols, the shotgun, and the hunting rifle. Pistols are semi-automatic, so you can control your rate of fire with them. Shotgun has bad iron sights, but it makes up for it with a wide shot spread so you just need to aim for the head. Heck you may even take down more than one zombie with a single shell. The Hunting rifle zooms in and it's the sniper rifle, so you don't have to deal with iron sights with it.  7. Getting stuck on stuff - This is more of a minor complaint, but there are times that it feels like I get stuck in doorways at times. It looks like I got enough room to enter, but some how I still get stuck.  Now for the things I like about the game.  1. The Enviroment - It actually feels like a proper zombie apocalypse. Nothing is clean, nothing is overly destroyed. Things feel just right.  2. Zombies are true to nature - Short of shooting them in the head, blowing them up with a grenade, or hitting them with a melee weapon. A zombie will keep coming after you. Thank you devs, these are true Zombies!  3. Sound effects - The sound effects in this game are really good in my opinion. Since there is no real map to use, you can listen for the gun shots of your fellow survivors to actually tell you a general idea of what direction they're at. Or as a Zombie you can use it to find where your targets are at (short of using the vision sight for foot prints.) Overall everything sounds good in this game.  4. Limited resources - Nothing worse than playing a survival game and finding every little thing you need in the world in no time. Ammo, weapons, and medical kits are so hard to find. You actually have to concern yourself on how you approach the streets, corners, buildings, and rooms.  5. Infection - There is a chance when you get hit by a zombie that you actually get infected. If you're infected, there is a limit of time before you start to feel it and eventually turn against your fellow survivors. You won't know you're infected till it's too late. Some people may find this annoying, but I love it. Even if you die as a survivor, the game isn't over for you. Because now you can fight against them as a zombie and lead Hordes of zombies towards them. (Nice way of getting payback on those Ammo hoaders)  6. Board up and hold out - Now I know everyone likes base building, but honestly it get's old seeing player made sky forts or whatever. Contagion may not have base building, but boarding up windows is one of the most logical ways of keeping the zombies out. I just wish the boards didn't fall inbetween line of sights. If a Zombie gets close enough to try and break into the building, it's hard to get them off the window boards without shooting the defense itself.  7. Plenty of maps and game modes - The game isn't limited to just your typical 'Start at A and get to C by moving through B' (Though ti does have a escape mode which is fun still), but you also have a PVP game mode where players start off killing each other, then holding out against zombie palyers in a game of Hide and seek. A objective based game where players locate survivors and take them to be extracted across zombie infested streets or neighborhoods. Also with players seemingly able to make their own playable maps, it's no real concern about there ever really being a feeling of a lack of enviroments to play in.  8. Maps change - Nothing better than playing a map that can change from another playthrough. I've had games where doors that were usually unlocked, were actually blocked off. So really you cannot predict what route you must take to get to a objective, you sort of have to learn on the fly.  9. Random starting gear - Our survivors may be all different, but the nice thing is that they start out with random gear. You may have just a pistol at first one game, then the next you may have a pistol and a SMG. I just feel this is a nice way to keep things feeling interesting.  Overall Contagion isn't a bad game, but it doesn't do too many things great. With some stuff fixed, a few improvements made, and some other little things. The game can honestly stand toe to toe with the Left 4 Dead games. Don't take this as me saying 'i want it to be more like Left 4 Dead.' I just want to see some more stuff that will pull me into the game more. One more zombie type, fixed weapon iron sights (or at least a visual zoom in), and some other little things would just be perfect for someone like me. While I cannot stand playing the game for hours on end. I can at least say what time I do play, I enjoy greatly.  If you see this game on sale and you want a good little Zombie shooter game, I would highly suggest picking this game up. I only paid five bucks and don't regret it.",

The gameplay itself is really good, but it doesnt make sense why most of the time you play as a zombie instead of a survivor, because most if not all games you join will have you as one. Also, why do the zombies have stamina? I don't know, but ohwell. One last thing is the lack of content. Theres only 3 maps and 3 modes.

If another dead player doesn't manage to kill you, one of the armored zombies wearing M1 Abrams Tank armor will. These ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s absorb 20-30 of your precious rounds, only to be killed by some guy who takes a single whack at him with a baseball bat. Ok.   Before you even begin to play the game, make sure your graphic settings are all on LOW because if you neglect to do this, your flashlight, when turned on, will literally make you feel like you're in the presence of God. The ♥♥♥♥in' glare and flare effect they added is awful, and makes the game unplayable until you turn down your shaders (I think).  Levels require you to pick up all kinds of ♥♥♥♥ in order to complete it, such as keys, fire extinguishers, etc. In the mean time, you're trying to juggle weapons that actually have ammo (which there is none) and you only have 4 slots combined to juggle all this useless keys and ♥♥♥♥ with while trying to maintain a decent arsenal.... How do they expect you to do this???   BZZZZZT BZZZZZZZZT BZZZZZZZZT! What was that? Oh, that's just your cellphone going off; receiving passive-aggressive and sometimes useful automated text messages from other players about how to complete the level. Press B to access it. Can't see what they're saying? Near-sighted you say? Press right mouse button in order to jam the Nokia 3310 between your eyes.  Your character has the fitness level of a chainsmoking old man, and you are required to take a 6 or 7 second break after sprinting less than 20 yards. Jumping, which is an entirely useless feature to the game, also takes about 33% of your stamina bar. Speaking of which, there are a wide variety of characters to choose to play from, but they are all seemingly the same statistically with no distinguishable attributes. As a result, the most played characters are the ones with the largest and flashiest (pixelated) boobs. I can't believe I'm typing this but I actually had a guy get upset with me because I 'took his bae'. Hilarious. At least, that's what I think he was saying over voice coms, it can be hard to tell because whatever audio codec the game utilizes makes everyone else sound like they're trying to speak with a sock in their mouth.  Weapons do not scale as you might think they would. One would assume something like a 12 gauge shotgun would be MUCH more potent than the measily 9mm you start off with, but sometimes you'll aim down sight and shoot a zombie at point blank range with a shotgun and they just won't die (and forget collateral damage....Do the devs realize shotguns use pellets that spread?). HOW!!! Every single pistol in this game is a 1 shot to the head, so just stick to those and the automatic weapons which are also a 1 shot to the head. Stay away from all the shotguns, leverguns, wheelguns, and whatever other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that they've added that does 0 damage.  I wonder why they even included grenades and such in the game when they are so EXCEEDINGLY rare and take up 1 of your 4 precious inventory slots.... Is someone really gonna drop a gun loaded with ammo for a ♥♥♥♥ing 1 use grenade??? I don't think so... You can't drop your keys or ♥♥♥♥in' fire extinguiser or bolt cutters for it either because the moment you do, you just KNOW it'll be required 15 mins from now in order to continue the level, and you'll have to run back 500 meters (wasing what little ammo you have left) in order to re-obtain it.  Doors seem to offer little protection in this game, as zombies can literally noclip their arms through them, and hit you on the other side. And don't bother relying on a door to give you some momentary seperation from the zombies either. On some occasions, it'll take a zombie 30-40 seconds to knock down a wooden door before attacking you. Then, you'lll randomly have your back turned to a METAL door and it'll just come FLYING off the hinges after 1 zombie hit... Did the zombie ♥♥♥♥in charge his biceps up or something? I don't get it....  Another thing I don't understand is why the devs chose to reuse the character models as zombie models.... Is it really that difficult to keep them mutually exclusive? Often times I run around the corner, seeing my friend's character, only for it to be a zombie and I take 25% of my health and throw it away because I got confused. Also sometimes you'll go through a door and turn around and there will be a zombie floating, frozen in midair that will drop on your head like creature from the outback and destroy you. What the ♥♥♥♥?  The registration seems OK, I can't really complain about it. It's certainly doesn't have the accuarcy and registration you would expect from a 128 tick CS:GO server, but it's alright. Don't expect to shoot anyone in the head from 30+ yards out. Just wait until they are closer.   It took me and a friend 4 hours of in-game time and 6 total tries just to beat ♥♥♥♥in de_roanoke_police_idiots or whatever that ♥♥♥♥ is. God DAMN it man.    I rate it 200/100, like my blood pressure after getting killed by a random russian guy that joined our US WEST server and died just to become a zombie and kill us.",

I don't know why this was a good idea in the first place. -The game is a mess with invisible walls and unusable ladders which I thought there should've been more creative ways to block those areas. -There is no vote to change maps or restart game when it breaks from what I remember but I could be wrong. -What's even the point in having the bow &amp; arrow in the game when you never see a bow or an arrow at the same place? -The hunted gamemode seems to be the only one that's good if you're not playing with friends but a lot of the maps feel like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mazes that if you were playing with a friend you will have trouble finding eachother. Also the fact that it's 'You win if you're the last man' is pretty lame. It would be great if there were some escape route or something and you all had to fight for it or you can band together with a friend but nope. -The game is just lacking with updates and content that it feels like your typical Early Access.

CONS  -The gun gameplay is BAD and the game has the worst rifle scope in history, wich makes it very scary to use since all the zombies in the medium sized maps of this game will come knocking at your door when you shoot even one bullet.  -Not many players in multiplayer, which makes it difficult (for me at least) to find a server with good ping.  -The zombies lag! This is a major and a common problem in zombie games. I haven't seen a zombie game with zombie hordes where the zombies wouldn't lag, with the exeption of Black Ops zombies. This is not my computers fault since it runs everything quite well.  -Too much 3d anaglyph.. At first on early access the amount of it was good and it gave the game a little bit more realistic feel. Now there is just too much of it though. It is ditorting and confusing.   PROS  +Mods! This game has mods, which can of course make it better by some amount. In the other hand there aren't too many of them, because there aren't that many players either..  +Well it has zombies and CO-OP, so if you like those things you will enjoy this game to some extent like I did, even though it is a little unpolished and crappy :P  CONCLUSION  This is Steam, so buy it on sale if you really like co-op zombie games.

However that may be exactly what currently making this game outstanding and induce euphoria on first use to any survival game enthusiast. I mean if you want a pure survival gem, you probably want Contagion right now - before it will be tainted by all-popular 'balancing' stuff, like special infected and infinity horde collection mode.  Just look the negative reviews - people actually complains what they can't shove off bunch of zombies with a 700g handgun swing. Yes, in Contagion you'll die if you failed to determine the right moment to reload when fighting horde. You'll also die if you failed to check what is behind door before opening it... Or to check room for stray zombie before start looting it... Or to plan yourself retreat path before engaging larger hordes.

The game provides only 3 co-op maps and a fist full of decent weapons (sorry kebar knife you're out) The updates, as far as my experinces, are very slow to come out, but when they do they're full of half-decent thingys  GOOD: The game provdies a wonderful Gamemode called 'hunted' where you're so-called friends get a laugh out of hunting each other (those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s). Overall the gamemode is very tense and I would buy it just for that gamemode. The other gamemodes are nothing glorious, but nevertheless fun. There's the 'extraction' where you'll experience your 'friends' hogging all the loot trying to 'save' surviors from a horde of zombies that arrive the moment you open a door (of course this is a fun gamemode as well) Then there's the 'escape' gamemode where your 'friends' will acuatally have to 'work together' (meaning your more dense freind shot a shotgun into a horde of zombies you were hoping to avoid) Again a fun gamemode Oh and the graphics are half decent as well.

O  Sound is immersive and realistic.    CONS :   X  There is a lack of maps, but that's okay as long as they are working on making the mechanics of the game better. You can only play the gametypes for certain maps. They should consider making survival-like versions of every extraction map or versus gamemode so that you could play the same mode but in a survival mode.   X  The gunshots in this game sound like little BB guns. There is only about one gun that sounds like an actual gun and the sound isn't even for the right type of gun. Not big enough of a deal to take a rating off, but hey it's the little things that count.    X  The shove with V is terrible, it doesn't even push the zombies away.   X  When you die, the game is extremely boring. You spend all of your time as a zombie going around trying to find the humans and it's just terrible.     CONCLUSION : Concept is good but needs a LOT of work. If you are reading this and have watched the trailer, realize that the trailer is a bit misleading. Not all of the things in the trailer are in the game yet, but that's not to say that they won't add it soon.

However, the game has been updated regularly so you can count on the developers to add more things to the game. I play this game every time there is an update so that I can change the review to match what the current product is. I do realize the game is in beta and I hope they continue working to make it a better game.   EDIT :  As of 3/10/14 the game has been updated several times and improved on animations, bugs, and the graphical user interface. I have updated the overall rating to match its current state.

            "review_text": "Contagion is a 2011 medical thriller directed by Steven Soderbergh. The film features an ensemble cast that includes Marion Cotillard, Bryan Cranston, Matt Damon, Laurence Fishburne, Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kate Winslet, and Jennifer Ehle. Contagion's plot documents the spread of a virus transmitted by fomites, attempts by medical researchers and public health officials to identify and contain the disease, the loss of social order in a pandemic, and finally the introduction of a vaccine to halt its spread. To follow several interacting plot lines, the film makes use of the multi-narrative 'hyperlink cinema' style, popularized in several of Soderbergh's films.  Soderbergh and screenwriter Scott Z. Burns had collaborated on The Informant! (2009). Following that film's release, both considered creating a biopic covering Leni Riefenstahl's life, before Burns brought up the idea of producing a medical thriller film depicting the rapid spread of a virus, which was inspired by various pandemics such as the 2003 SARS epidemic and the 2009 flu pandemic. To devise an accurate perception of a pandemic event, Burns consulted with representatives of the World Health Organization as well as noted medical experts such as W. Ian Lipkin and Lawrence 'Larry' Brilliant. Principal photography started in Hong Kong in September 2010, and continued in Chicago, Atlanta, London, Geneva, and San Francisco until February 2011.  Contagion premiered at the 68th Venice Film Festival in Venice, Italy on September 3, 2011, and went on general release on September 9. The film was well received by critics, who praised the narratives and the performances of various actors and actresses. It was also well received by scientists, who praised its accuracy. Commercially, the film was a moderate box office success. Budgeted at USD $60 million, Contagion attained $135 million in box office revenue during its theatrical run.",

And also, ammo and weapons were really scarce for us when we were playing until we went over to the bank which had a lot of weapons in the security armoury, so we got the weapons fight off the horde of zombies then we had to find the truck that came for us so we started searching for it which was pretty hard, but we did find it and we were proud cause it was the first time we actually the first time we beat an escape map and we were so happy.

            "review_text": "TLDR - Good idea and premise but horrible execution and playability. Cannot recommend.  Long version: First thing to slap me in the face was the horrible controls, moving, aiming and shooting. Moving around felt blocky and sticky. It's hard to describe in words but those would be the best words to describe it. You're trying to walk forward but you cannot because the invisible borders of a table or such is blocking you. Move a tiny bit to the side and you can walk forward. Shooting stuff.. just eww. Firstly Contagion uses the (now) standard ADS for aiming and shooting. But how it actually feels and behaves as you play will drive you insane. It is the most frustrating thing ever when you are aiming at the head of a zombie around a car length away, fire and you miss. Zombie is only slightly wobbling from side to side, not moving and you miss. You aim a second time, ever carefully aiming and aligning the sights, fire and miss a second time. At this point you cuss, throw the mouse across the room, smack ESC and promptly exit the game. It is really hard to put into words how frustrating and annoying the aiming and shooting is in this game but maybe just saying it does not feel 'natural' or comfortable would suffice. Anyone who has ever shot a handgun or a rifle in real life can relate to the next issue. When the game is trolling you with stuff like 'There is no automatic reload' and then you shoulder an AR-15.. facepalm immediately. Feels like you're trying to shoulder it but at the same time you move your head as back as possible while pushing the rifle as far as possible from you and then you're trying to squint through the sights. I cannot understand how they could mess up so badly the main idea of ANY zombie shooter, the actual shooting. Some other things to note (in bad or good, you decide). There are only two zombie types, regular and 'riot', where the latter is 'armored' (Yes a riot helmet and vest will totally resists several rounds of intermediate cartridges or higher). The maps are quite nice and realistic looking. Realistic in the sense of how one would imagine it to be in this type of situation. Graphics look quite outdated (In my opinion Left 4 Dead looks much better, yes the first). Game modes are pretty 'standard' with the usual PvE (escape and civilian rescue)/PvP and mixed modes of those two.  The few hours that I've played Contagion I really do not recommend it. The idea and premise seem promising but the execution and playability is horrible that it will frustrate you to no end. For the money there are better alternatives.",

The maps are a decent size and weapons are relatively easy to find and easy to access. Every gun sounds and handles great with little to no problems about bullets not registering. I haven't experienced any lag and there are little to no bugs from what I see ( except an occasional zombie getting trapped behind some funiture). the graphics are good and maps are pretty well detailed. The AI is kind of derpy at sometimes. In some cases you could be standing yard or two away from zombies and they wouldn't even see you standing there. My only big problem in the game I see is that you get control of the situation to quick! there is almost little to no dread in the 'survival' situation of the game. If your playing with a well coordinated team or just one friend in any of the modes theres not much you haft to worry about except other players. Now what I mean by that is sometimes weapons, ammo, and health are too easy to find and stack way to high!!!! you could have more then 100 rounds in any smg, assualt riffle, or even the pistol. Besides the rediculous amount of ammo you can obtain with four weapons is that the hordes of the zombies are too small.   Pros: - No lag - every gun looks, sounds, and handles great. - decent graphics, good maps, well detailed enviroments - classic shoot in the head to kill zombie style gamplay  Cons: - occasional bullet not registering and weird AI - loot in the game is to easy to access   overall 8.5 out of 10 would like to see a variety of new maps, maybe make it so you can't contain so much ammo, and more random hordes of zombies.",

            "review_text": "If you've played Left 4 Dead, it's basically more of the same but with less special infected (there's only the bullet-sponge that is the riot-gear zombie) and more objectives.  There are also different gamemodes available. Things like Escape, where you try to do exactly that, while completing objectives along the way (unlock this, go here, press this, hold off against these, etc), Evac, where you go around collecting survivors to escort to safety, or the true PvP gamemode where you hunt each other when you're alive and have to watch out for zombies.  If a player dies, they come back as a zombie. This will usually ruin the game if you're in a small team, because for some reason they take a lot more damage. They also bob and weave which, combined with their pings, means you miss a lot before they're tearing at your face. But in a large group, it's usually not a problem.  But I mostly enjoy the Escape maps. Completing objectives as they appear on the phone you use to tell you were to go has a satisfying sense of accomplishment. While you're killing zombies, you're keeping an eye out for things like key cards, boltcutters, or keys, just in case they're useful later. It brings a sense of teamwork, when each person gives up a valuable weapon slot to carry an item that we might need later. And it all comes together when you've fought through hell, got down to your last clip, and then you find a locked door that you can open with something you've saved that whole time. All the goodies waiting behind, ready to re-kit your team into killing machines.  All in all, a game I enjoy wasting a couple of hours on here and there, though I would advise to wait for it to go on sale (the full price is a bit steep, in my eyes).  Edit: I would like to mention this: if you become a zombie, you only get 4 lives and then you enter spectator mode for the rest of the game. A terrible idea, really, and I hope it gets changed.",

But now, I found out that the game is finally released and I'm not disapointed. At first I wanted to get this game because it reminded me of The Walking Dead TV show (Which I say about a lot of zombie games but they are not as they seem to me at first) but it's not like that at all except for the 'Only headhsots kill' rule. Now since the release a lot has changed: New and modified weapon slots which make it easier to find weapons, new zombie 'Roar' feature which lures more zombies to the survivors to make them suffer even more, achievments, trading cards, modes and an improved intro and menu. The level section is easy to choose from, the only problem is that there still aren't many servers to play on, but if you do find one, the experience is great. The levels are never the same and the keyitems are always scattered in different locations and some pathways are closed in one playthrough but in the other they aren't. The only negative aspects I can find in this game for now are the way too overpowered human controlled zombies and the zombie spawn points. They don't die to a single headshot, no, they take an entire magazine to the face to die. They are just normal zombies to blend into the crowd and not some special infected like in Left 4 Dead, so they should have lower health and better spawn points. They can kill a human in about 2 hits and once you respawn you need to find the survivors at the other end of a totally confusing map! All in all Contagion is fun zombie game and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes zombie survival games which they can play with friends.",

You can go to an extraction point with co-op, defend some AI and a bit more. There is also a PvP mode where you also spawn with a pistol and have to look for other weapons and ammo while there are players looking for you. Oh yeah and there are also AI zombies and player zombies (only when died once). They have to step up their game with animations, weapons and graphics. While graphics are reasonable, for me it isn't that big of a deal. The thing they need to improve most is the AI. It supports steam workshop so thats fairly awesome, with the workshop you can get camos kind of. Other than that there isn't customization in-game, except you can change the mobile phone background and ringtone. Conclusion: This game has to improve more and step up their game.",

And it feels like there should be more guns  -The multiplayer search function is broken -In the playmodes with npcs the npcs are basicly props with a bad aim that follow you around like lost puppys and no AI -The mobile phone that you get objectives from is actually kind of good but it feels like it could of been so much more  Although it has some good points: + The characters are actually quite interesting, for example during gameplay they comment in various ways like curseing the zombies or cheering a good kill, and although the models are quite lor res for a modern game the characters look like they belong in a zombie apocolypse +Although the maps are essensially mazes with some paths blocked its a good maze and its enjoyable to navigate for the first few times. +Its quite atmospheric and is quite eery at time +the zombie deaths are quite realistic and not rediculously gorey without being the simple resident evil melting into the floor benignety  All in all it feels like it should still be a beta and i home the developers update this game and improve some of the textures",

The map selection is small but what makes it fresh is that locations change, while some doors will be open one time the next they will be blocked up and you'll have to find alternate paths or alternate items to progress. It would be nice for more maps to be added in the future though.  Gameplay is great, I feel it's as realistic as it can be in a zombie apocalypse in which if a crowd finds you, you will be overwhelmed which means you need to form tactics with a partner or solo, the way that the zombies only really die by headshots is also brilliant while difficult when first getting into the game but it becomes easier in time. The objectives are plenty and each gamemode has different aims which is great when you get bored with one.  The only issues I can really come up with are zombies pathing is sometimes strange but it doesn't affect the game much, could use some more maps. Also when infection is on and you'll sometimes change for no reason even if you haven't been hit, but it's not extremely common though when at the end of a game waiting to escape it's a damn pain in the ♥♥♥.

            "review_text": "Pros: (From a survivor point of view. I haven't played as a zombie enough to make a judgemental call on the mechanics.)  - A fresh take in a market saturated with zombie game clones. I would put it's character towards a more fast-paced No More Room In Hell. - There is attention to detail. The developers are stubborn, but they're putting in work that counts. - A fun, team-based game where team work is almost necessary in PVP modes such as Extraction (with player zombies). Working together gives you a real sense of accomplishment - The movement of your player, aiming/shooting, and the pathing involved in maps is fluid and crisp. - Weapons (guns) look and feel the way they should. - It's the zombie apocalypse in it's raw form; Zombies, and that's it. - Official servers can USUALLY handle the amount of bandwidth a full game demands. - Multiple game modes to choose from, as well as various maps (both night and day) that can give you replayability beyond what you'd expect. - The community is USUALLY friendly, meaning that your team mates and enemies are usually friendly folks. There's always a few bad eggs in every basket, so I can't knock it for that. It's Steam, expect it everywhere. - Extraction-based objectives vary each time you play, so you get a different path each time you play a certain map. That adds replayability as well.  Cons:  - When servers DO spiral out of control from the use of bandwidth in a full game, it really drags you down. A few laggy players that are connecting from a far enough distance (120 ms+) will affect everyone. Once the game starts getting bogged down, a lot of finesse and quick reactions absolutely required to emerge victrorious in any PVP game start to become impossible to execute. Bullet lag and frame skipping (not graphical) will get you killed before you know it.  - Melee weapons are a bit pointless at times. The ammo the game gives you, even in the most extreme difficulties, is usually over the top and enough to supply four players.  - When you DO use melee weapons, they all feel exactly the same and make no sense. The Kabar knife has close to the same range as, say, the fireaxe or the sledgehammer.  - Regardless of range, melee weapons never have a greater length of attack than the zombies. You have to close in so much to a target that even if they're standing still, you have the risk of getting hit by a zombie whilst slinging your sledgehammer around. That's a big issue for me.  - Knockback. I know it sounds cliche, but I expect at least a little reaction from a zombie when they get pegged in the head from the head of a sledge at full swing. They don't. They don't even skip a beat. Nothing. And when you're moving around a lot while a zombie is attacking you, that lack of reaction is cringe-worthy and will most likely end up with you being hit. I'm not the best at this game, but I have my feet firmly planted on the ground.  - Player zombies, novice or seasoned veteran, love to approach you the same way every time. You bee-line your way to the player and crouch, jump, make unpredictable/unrealistic movements and spam left click from a range that exceeds that of AI zombies. The player zombie may appear ten feet away from you, but he can sure as hell hit you. This makes melee even more pointless against player zombies. Latency/Lag only amplifies these dimensions, making any game that isn't 40 or less ms a frustrating struggle. The PZs, as they're called, should be more of a glass cannon type. They have infinite respawns, and do so instantly when they're killed. No downtime. Therefore, I think they should have a higher rate of damage, but less mobility and range.  - Another issue with latency is dealing with hitting a PZ. I've seen myself and others shoot a Remington 870 police magnum at point blank range with several shots at one. Regardless that we've seen both visual and audio confirmation that the PZ had been hit in the head (blood splatters and squishy flesh sounds), they simply don't take any damage. When a PZ is heading towards you in aforementioned bee-line, it only makes it more nonsensical and proves my point.  - Voice acting is sub-par, but comical at best. There's an option to turn it off all together, and I would highly recommend so. It gets a tad annoying when your character is yelling the same cliche lines literally every 10-15 seconds.  Overall, this game has enough to offer that I'd say give it a shot! It's not the greatest, but it's most definitely not the worst. I'm interested to see where the developers take this game in the near future.",

One gunshot in the wrong place at the wrong time can really ♥♥♥♥ you. Thats another reason this game is disliked so much, because its so hard, and I wont lie, its hard. If you dont like difficult games, stay clear of this one. Other than that, great game, great engine, solid gameplay.",

However, I was very pleased with this game when we first started playing it. I bought the four-pack. We had a lot of fun with it from the start and it was a nice change from the typical L4D style zombie shooter. I'd reccomend it to anyone. While it isn't perfect and it has flaws, I have certainly been able to get my money out of it.",
