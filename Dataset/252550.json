The game has five worlds with 6 levels on each one to go through, and each world gives new environmental touches, new puzzles to solve, and new unique cubes to play around with to solve those puzzles. And for those referencing the game to the 'free' one on Desura, while good, it doesn't even compare to the polish and content this game offers compared to the student project demo on desura. For the asking price i think QBEH-1: The Atlas Cube is a great purchase.  More info here:  KSalue  [www.ksalue.com] ",

            "review_text": "Play time ~29 hours  This game is fantastic. Simple basic mechanics that are easy to learn in order to progress through the game, with then more powers unlocked later on and more obstacle types as well. The puzzles are hard enough to make you think but never too hard to ever stump you. The game may pose to be slightly repetitive after awhile though so I suggest playing with breaks in between. Still worth every penny though. I also love how there are secrets on each level that make you try to discover where they are - some are not trivial and you will just feel great finding them.  The game looks fantastic, has great atmosphere (settings, sound, music, expansiveness), so not only does it test your mind but you also feel immersed in to the game.  Also the game is family friendly - no violence what so ever. I highly recommend this game.",

            "review_text": "Qbeh-1: The Atlas Cube is a beautiful little atmospheric first person puzzle platformer. A good comparison game would be Q.U.B.E., both Qbeh-1 and Q.U.B.E. feature a very atmospheric world where the story is without narrative and open to interpretation. One of the most notable differences is that, unlike in QUBE which had some color puzzles and other such puzzles, Qbeh-1's puzzle mechanics, although varying, focus around different ways to move your character around a level. In this sense I found the game captured something of older platforming collect-a-thons, the levels themselves get rather large and many times you find yourself scaling a large tower...and add in the secret golden pyramid on each level and it really homes in on that collect-a-thon feel. This game also does a good job in encouraging you to explore, don't expect every piece of the puzzle to be out in the open for you to get your hands on, sometimes you need to look around and check the nooks and crannies to find what you need, something I wish other puzzle platformers did just a bit more.  I really don't think there is much else to say, the gameplay is superb and the aesthetics really set a nice mood (the music is stellar!) I'm glad I bought this when I did and I'm glad I played it. I found the six hours playthrough to be satisfying, and despite having a huge backlog to get through, I am looking forward to continuing by finding the remaining golden pyramids and unlocking the bonus world. Highly recommend to puzzle platformer fans!",

            "review_text": "Bought this at 25% off regular price but this is well worth the sticker price of $9.99. The visuals are stunning and the puzzles are easy enough to keep most people interested but not so easy that you feel cheated. Of course the puzzles do get progressively more difficult but theres something satisfying about finally finding the solution.   There doesn't really seem to be any kind of storyline or supporting characters so if thats what your seeking look elsewhere. However, with the tranquille almost trancelike quality of the sound track, you'll quickly forget about storylines.    NOTE:   I have not completed the game yet so if there is a storyline I appologise in advance to the devs and anyone reading this review.  If you like first person puzzle games and don't mind a slower pace or lack of supporting characters/storyline then this is a great buy for you. I do think it could do with a world builder and maybe some kind of stat/ranking system but other than that I really like this game and recommend you play it.",

            "review_text": "I've now finished all of 'The Atlas Cube' and overall the experience was very relaxing and beautiful. Liquid Flower has done an exceptional job, the level design is fluent and flows with the colour scheme of each world.  As I had faintly remembered my experience playing the demo Qbeh I was pleased to see the ending was very similar in that we were dragged into the 'Atlas Cube'. The puzzles were logical and easy to understand making this game simple and quick to get through. The levels were long which was great because it helped break the playtime into sections however although the loading time was designed to be long (like I was waking up through every level), I found it rather annoying when I wanted to check what level I was on and I had to wait to exit to the menu and wait to go back into the level. Maybe including the name/level number on the pause/exit menu would've been nice. Also I did occasionally find the Z-fighting on a few cubes here and there but not enough for it to affect the game at all in any negative way.   I felt a connection with each level, it felt really inviting and warm as they each had their own characteristic. I couldn't help but admire the beauty of some of the levels with the water, especially the interior/dark levels with the lights emmitting and illuminating the water.   Playing through the game I noticed Liquid Flower took very attentive care to small details upon the levels, balancing it out so the levels weren't scattered with small pieces however they didn't seem dull and blank at all.  As I went through each level I played it very wisely, being as conservative as possible and saving as many of my cubes. I was only able to find a few triangle gems, so it would've been nice if it had a record system which you can set a high score for how many cubes you save finishing the level so that way I'm not wasting all that time going back into the chamber and picking up the cubes which I can save So thanks Liquid Flower for making such an amazing game. Great job!",

Also there are pyramids to collect in each level if you want.   It's seriously good. It's clever without being too hard. If you're stuck, wander around until you're not. I only had to look up a single thing, and it turned out to be blazingly obvious, really.   Buy it. If you like puzzles, seriously get this game. It's one of my all time favorites.",

            "review_text": "I'll mainly write this from the perspective as an Oculus Rift user and how I experienced this game in VR.  Qbeh-1 is a puzzle game with pretty straightfoward mechanics, taking place in simplistic but atmospheric environments. The music and presentation make it very enjoyable to play in VR. The fact there is a hidden token in every level also encourages you to be aware of your environment and spot hidden routes.  However there are a few downsides for the VR player at the moment:  * Movement isn't too VR friendly. This is mainly because of the continous turning of the player instead of having the option to enable incremental turning (the aptly named 'VR comfort mode' pioneered by Cloudhead Games). Jumping might feel a bit abrupt too and can be a bit heavy on the stomach for those that are sensitive to it. I'd recommended new VR users to acclimate to VR a bit with other demos before jumping into this game. * Framedrops in some levels. Even on my high-end rig, some of the larger levels dip below the recommended 75 fps for some reason (while my CPU and GPU remain underutilized). This could be in part due to the current Oculus drivers and the performance impact of using the Rift's Direct Mode, but anyway, it ruins the experience. * Some spots in the game might require you to stretch your neck a bit in order to reach spots that are right above you (and might make your headphones fall off, as in my case). This is to be expected if the game wasn't initially designed with VR in mind, but it's still playable. Just something to keep in mind.",

The simplicty of the game makes it so good, there is absolutely no need for a tutoral and doesn't overcomplicate the begining with dumb-filler-nobodycaresabout-exposition. Rather it lures you in with mystery. I have still yet to play the game through but from what I've seen in a mere 54 minutes is awesome.  The name 'Qbeh-1' is hopefully insinuating a second.  Overall 9.9999/10  reason: the .00001 deduction is because the trees glitch out, the textures for some reason are plauged with black lines.",
