I imagine this ad is supposed to be satirical however when I saw it for the fourth time after other seizure inducing effects I realized that the ad wasn't actually ironic at all. The smug guy is the developer, happy he managed to sell what can only be called a trainwreck of a game.   Unimaginative level designs, boring weapons, clipping through level geometry, and hit effects that will blind and annoy you with how obnoxious they are. Avoid this dreck.   ",

The eye-straining visuals and effects can only last so long before my eyes start to hurt. The game is multiplayer only yet even after being launched through the Humble Monthly Bundle the game has 1 active server. The game isn't fun, strains your eyes and will be dead by next month. Don't waste your money, go buy a candy bar, at least that will have temporary satisfaction.",

The fact it is multiplayer only does not help it with no one to play with.  The game as a tech demo is a very nice proof of concept but it needs some serious work before it is playable again. For now, you should avoid Random Access Murder.",

There is no objective and this game has the appeal of playing with a friend who hasn't figured out how to play yet. Then it's just nothing. It needs objectives, a timer, something, ANYTHING. It's glitchy, awkward, repetitive and heartbreaking. If this game was getting updated and improved, i would say it's worth keeping an eye on. But yeah only get this game if you got it for free and have 20 minute to kill.",
