The gameplay is easy to grab quick enough, altough the gameplay either has you feeling invencible in one mission (You know your not going to die anytime soon) and completely helpless in another.   Aside from the fact that boss matches leave you knocked down for 4 seconds as you despretley wait for you charcter to get up, it is a good play through. The story is intresting enough, as well to keep you playing through.",

The game is straight foward and works well. I did have some issues playing this due to a Microsoft update back in March of 12 but uninstalling it fixed the problem.",

            "review_text": "One thing about this game that's very upsetting is the fact, that the game frequently crashes under directx 10 on windows 7. So in order to avoid these issues, you'll have to run the game under directx 9 instead, unfortunately.  Even though the game controls alright using a gamepad, you can tell that it is a console game.  The game's storyline is being presented through cutscenes every once in a while, but even those aren't that well done and fail to draw the player in.  Missions are very linear and not too difficult, with the exception of the occasional boss encounter, which can be quite challenging.   The final boss encounter was pretty frustrating, because I had to defeat him 10 times in order for him to actually die - just getting his health to zero didn't seem to be enough. If you do not strike him with a fully charged sword attack, he can't be killed.  5/10",

This game is great, old yet still very intersting. The story is stunning and mech combat is always fun. I found this game is pretty much a playable anime, imagine gundam but with aliens. So depending on how you think of that is how you should decide to buy this game.",
