            "review_text": "A love letter to Descent. Exellently done with smooth, tight controls and a bangin' chiptune ambient soundtrack, its a rewarding roguelike that demands cautious exploration, ammo conservation and deft mastery of the controls to dismantle the rogue bots and get to the reactor at the end of each level. Levels are a good length and an intentionally blocky texture theme combined with brain-meltingly awesome lighting system makes playing them enjoyable and nostalgic.  Despite these accolades, Sublevel Zero needs work in a few minor areas. Specifically, there's no thief bot, and there's a major lack of variety with regards to hull upgrades. There are no energy recharge stations (which was the primary benefit of generally weaker energy weapons). An autolevel control would be nice instead of hiding it in the menu and having it be always on or off. Also an irritating omission: complete lack of D-pad controls for the menu/UI system. It would also be nice if there were a way to recycle useless junk for nanites. There are also no secret doors or areas, which is a disappointment (or are there?!?). Finally, I know that this is a single player game. But come ON guys. Let's release a multiplayer DLC for this. It's practically begging for it.  As an interesting side note, the game also accomplishes the hilarious feat of demonstrating exactly how terribly designed Descent's levels were, as the random generation engine in this game routinely churns out better levels than Descent did.   All in all, aside from a few minor blemishes and missed opportunities, this game is a perfect translation of Descent into a roguelike format. If you're a fan of these types of games, Sublevel Zero simply shouldn't be missed. I think this might also appeal to you if you enjoy flight sims or first person shooters. Some people just wanna run around with a gun, but if floating around a zero-g envrionment shooting endless hordes of robots with ever-more-powerful weapons sounds fun to you, I encourage you to give Sublevel Zero a try.",

Pacing is good, graphics are trippy and fitting and the whole thing is crafted with palpable passion for detail and atmosphere. Making it a roguelike with procedural created levels is a smart move, adding a crafting system even more so.  I just hope it sells well so that we might get more of sublevel zero in the future.

            "review_text": "Sublevel Zero is one of the most enjoyable 6DoF games you've probably never heard of.   Its inspirations are immediately obvious, right down to your ship's appearance--this is Descent by way of roguelite. The execution is simple: Alone, you pilot your ship 6-levels deep into a procedurally-generated asteroid base (dungeon), collecting intel and items while fighting robotic opponents. True to form, if you die, you have to start all over.  There are a few interesting additions to the recipe, however. For instance, weapons have a characteristic-naming system that affects their stats. So you won't just find a 'Laser', you'll find a 'Chaotic Laser', a 'Useless Laser', a 'Razor Laser', etc. Each quality tends to modify weapons and items in certain ways, but there's also enough randomness to the system that small differences can even be found between two identically named weapons.   Ship customization comes in the form of hulls (re: 'armor' in another roguelike) and engines (...something other than armor). Hulls can be swapped out on the fly in order to modify how much stuff--both items and ammo--you can carry, as well as your hitpoints; engines can be swapped out to change movement, boost, and ramming stats. This whole system sits on top of your choice of 8* ships that basically act like classes, so there's a decent amount of variety in the ships you can end up with. *You only start off with access to 1 ship, however.  But perhaps the most unexpected gameplay mechanic--something I didn't realize when I started playing--is that Sublevel Zero has a crafting system. As you play, you unlock crafting options that allow you to combine weapons or items into new things. The whole system is fairly opaque--it's not always easy to tell HOW or WHY you unlocked a certain recipe--but it's a pretty interesting feature that produces an extensive arsenal including flamethrowers, lasers, miniguns, rocket launchers, pulsars, homing missiles, grenades, and autocannons. The individual characteristics and stats of each weapon/item seem to influence the final product, too, so you might have greater success sacrificing 'Berserker' or 'Savage' items instead of 'Slow' or 'Useless' items.  So is it challenging? For a roguelite, I'd say that Sublevel Zero can definitely put up a fight. Repair kits are relatively uncommon, occupy an item slot (a big deal when the basic ship only has 12 inventory slots) and take time to work. The first level may be inhabited by slow and ponderous robots that are easy to outmaneuver, but it isn't long before the game is throwing nimble, twirling, machinegunning drones, bumrushing drillbots, and worse at you. Ammo (or lack thereof) can be an issue too, emphasizing diversifying your arsenal and spending nanites (space gold) wisely on your upgrades.  A few cons:  1. No vibration support for gamepads 2. I haven't unlocked all of the ships yet, but everything so far is aesthetically identical to the default ship. It'd be nice if they looked different. 3. No Descent-style 'Guide Bot' to help navigate the increasingly large sprawls of later levels. 4. No secret areas.  I can't exactly say that the roguelike/roguelite market is packed with 6DoF games, which makes Sublevel Zero a refreshing installment in an otherwise saturated genre. If you've been looking for something that scratches that Descent/Forsaken itch, this game might be just what you need.",

That plus crafting and different guns leaves the player feeling nostalgic and generally awesome.  pros Pretty much Descent with a combination of updated graphics and downgraded graphics to make a fever dream worth the money. - Music is very effective chip-tunes. Lovely. - Sound effects are thoughtfully done and very impressive. - Graphics are unique. - Gameplay is smooth as butter. - Battles are fierce. - The game is challenging.  Cons If you can't take the heat of the orginal Descent, this game is very similar in gameplay. However, with the added layers of customizability this game may very well still impress.   - 'Love it or hate it' artistic look. - Large learning curve for those used to a more linear experience .   There really isn't anything else like this on the market right now.   10/10 would snag this puppy up again.",

            "review_text": "This game is absolutely brilliant. A lot of time, effort, inspiration, and hard work clearly went into making this game. And it shows on multiple different levels.  Visually the game is very interesting to look at, although it has an unusual aesthetic. Top notch visual effects are used (e.g. lighting and shading), but the actual textures themselves appear to be deliberately low-fi, with gigantic pixels clearly visible on every terrain surface. It just seems to work, although sometimes it can lend to a little bit of difficulty navigating cavern environments. Weapon effects are simplistic but used in such a way that they actually seem... right, somehow.  The game is a treat to the ear as well, especially when you consider the soundtrack. This has to be the most beautiful soundtrack I've heard in a game with dynamic music. I dare say that the music is as three-dimensional as the environments you fly in -- as changing environments (some of the levels are divided into multiple different environments), entering heated battles, and the like will augment the current song on the fly; entering caverns will make the music become more subdued, getting into a big fight will ramp up the drums and bass, etc. And that's all on top of there being several discrete 'base' songs. The music alone makes the experience well worth the price.  Level design is, of course, procedurally generated via the method you would expect -- prefabricated rooms are connected to one another in a random order. However it also occasionally hooks connecting tunnels as secondary passages between doors, and these tunnels seem to be able to twist and bend at multiple different points. The prefabricated rooms in the 'man-made' environment all have that Descent feel to them -- it's pretty clear that the designer took inspiration from the original, notable rooms in Descent and made minor tweaks to give them a little character of their own. My one complaint would be the cop-out the game uses to bar off dead-ends (replacing the door or doorway with an obvious unopenable, sealed door with a red X going through it).  Gameplay-wise, this is a definite hit. Save for the roguelite elements, it really does feel like a worthy spiritual successor to Descent. It hits the nail on the head with everything that 6DoF should be. But expect to die a lot, of course -- it is very difficult, but enough mad skills can get you through the day... with plenty of practice. And a good control setup.  The game handles very well and you can set it up to anything that works for you. Mouse and keyboard, gamepad, what have you. (If only the D-pad on my Saitek P990 hadn't broke off...) It's a cardinal sin to restrict your ability to remap controls, and one I'm thankful that these guys avoided -- but it shouldn't be surprising since the pioneer of this genre allowed absolute freedom in customizing controls.  Other cool things: The game supports resolutions so low you've probably not seen them since the early 2000s. It actually recognizes my gamepad and names the buttons on them ('Black button, silver button, FPS button') correctly.  If you loved Descent, and you're a fan of rogue-lite games, there's really no reason not to get this game, in my honest opinion. (okay, maybe if you've got an old computer that can't run it smoothly, that would be a reason...)",

I’ll probably have to look more into this genre from now on.   Sitting in the ship is really immersive (even with the retro graphics) and I love looking out the side window and being able to see my ship’s cannons. This is probably the most I’ve zipped around in VR so far; strafing, flipping, rolling, etc. and I’ve never gotten motion sick (though I’m not prone to VR sickness in general).   You have to deal with 6 degrees of movement, rotation, weapon selection/firing; which never felt completely natural. The controls are good… but I still haven’t become 100% comfortable with any of the controller layouts. (I used a PS4 controller)   The game is not overly complex, but it would have been nice to have better in-game instructions. For example, what do the colors of the items mean?

It is similar enough to be a spiritual successor of sorts. My only complaint is that the amount of weapons and enemies seems to be fairly limited, but I hope that more will be added later.  It shares a great deal of gameplay elements with the aforementioned  Descent , the core gist of the game being that you search for three coloured keys to pass through each level while fighting killer robots of various shapes and sizes, eventually reaching the reactor core, which you have to destroy to advance to the next level. Heck, you can even open doors by shooting them, a gameplay mechanic right out of  Descent . Each reactor core has more defenses than the last, resulting in some rather hectic boss fights.  The plot is fairly nonsensical (something about the universe falling part for no reason, creating warring factions throughout the universe, it's kind of confusing) but not central to the gameplay. What sets it apart from  Descent  is the addition of an inventory allowing you to carry health, and equip an array of different weapons and modifications to your ship, as well as craft others from the ones you find. You can also unlock more ships and blueprints as you play, which unlock on subsequent playthroughs. Also different from  Descent  is the fact that you are unable to save progress, like any other rogue-like; when you die, you start from the beginning. The levels are also generated randomly, meaning that each playthrough is different.  9/10",

            "review_text": "Reviewing for HTC Vive w/ Xbox One controller:  I'm what you might call VR sensitive. I get nauseous fairly easily in-game and can't usually play for more than 30 minutes or so. I expected this game to be a rollercoaster that I would be lucky to last 10 minutes in. So I'm not sure how, but my first session was 44 minutes before I started to feel queesy. My second (the next day) was nearly as long and I never even felt a touch of nausea.  With that out of the way, the game by iteself is a fun rogue-lite, and is absolutely immersive in VR. The levels are more or less linear with a few branching paths to explore, the enemies and weapons are varied quite well, and the feeling of leveling up progression is nice and steady partially due to the random loot, and partially because of the crafting. The crafting was a nice touch, though I wish the ships inventory was a little bigger so I didn't have to wonder if I'm throwing out a component I might want for crafting every time I drop an older item. But I'm not very far yet, so newer ships might be able to hold more.  Overall highly recommended for VR enthusiasts.",
