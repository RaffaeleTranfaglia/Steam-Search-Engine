            "review_text": "  I just finished playing through the non-VR version of the game.  PROs: Interesting storyline Noticable attention to detail in modelled game assets Clever adaptation of the puzzle/sleuth genre into the intended VR format  CONS: Short game!  I'm quite impressed with what nDreams has been able to create. And while the game is rather short, it has some replayability. I look forward to playing this again when I have an HTC Vive! ",

            "review_text": "I think that, as a Vive owner, I was a bit disappointed by the lack of motion controller support. I think when the Rift also has these, every game that involves walking about will absolutely *need* this capability - and I would guess The Assembly will get that in time. (If you want a good example of this, look to Vanishing Realms, a much lower visual fidelity game perhaps, but one that wins hugely in terms of immersion from its control method).  That said, plug in a 360 controller and it doesn't take long to become emersed in this title. It is clearly a big step up from much of the early bird stuff we've seen until now - an actual games studio producing a tentative step into the VR world. I still think it's only a first taste of what is possible, but at the very least a good first sip nonetheless.  UPDATE: Vive motion controllers are now supported, and - for me at least - this made a huge difference, moving around the game world is now so much better. Thanks to the devs, and well done!",

            "review_text": "One of the most original games I've ever played, The Assembly is based on extremely mature themes, highbrow ideas and more than a touch of science fiction. It is one of a new breed of indie games which delph into more serious and adult topics which borders on philosophical, making gaming an infinitely more cerebral experience which feels so much less passive and far more intellectually engaging.  The Assembly sees the player take two roles - two characters whose paths are intertwined, both based in the Assembly, an elite and secretive research society where science appears to bypass ethical and moral boundaries, and whose funding seems to be infinite. New employees are kidnapped and have to pass tests before earning the lucrative position, and if they reject it, have their brain wiped of memory of the entire incident before being returned to the real world.  The player is one such, Madeleine Stone, and an existing employee, Caleb Pearson, whose destinies play a vital role in the future of the organisation.  The Assembly is primarily built for VR, but keyboard and mouse works perfectly even if the gameplay and interactivity levels are limited - it works seamlessly, and it really is more of a story with some puzzles and button pressing. It also looks pretty good for an indie game, employing the very solid UE4. And the voice acting? Best I've heard in a video game - the main two protagonists are beautifully voiced, and the supporting cast isn't bad either.  The plot isn't easy to digest; it is deliberately a bit more highbrow than most video games, and a bit of knowledge of science jargon will definitely help; this is a game for a specific audience - most Joe and Jane Punters will not get this, and that is no insult to their intelligence. But if you do grasp where the story is going it'll grip you endlessly, and you'll be captivated to the end.  It's not the longest game, weighing in at about 4 hours, and is a bit pricey for that length, but the sheer quality does compensate for this with essentially a level of production which verges on AAA.  It's not for everyone - with some psychology, science, philosophy, ethical and moral questions in there, but if these themes appeal to you this will be for you.   Highly recommended.",
