            "review_text": "I'm running around the point with the platoon as a combat medic, and see my teammates going down left and right. I put down the shield regeneration bubble to recover my teammate's shields up and I start reviving my teammates. Also our engineers are supplying our teammates in the front. We all know that we're in a pich and that we need immediately some help. I see several friendly inflantrators sniping down enemies from behind, which is pretty much helping us a lot, but not nearly enough. Then I hear something beautiful behind us and from the Platoon chat. Our max crash is coming, and it's going to push the enemies back by a bit. We might be able to turn this war upside down for now.   This game... It's a fantastic game, especially if you are in a platoon with people who know their stuff and know how to give and listen to orders. It's basically a neverending war in a huge zone, where you capture areas and with some main areas, you will gain bonuses for your faction.    Once a faction is getting together and making up plans, strategies and orders, this game is an incredible game. It's not just a basic futuristic battlefield, but it's something where you really need and want people to stick together and fight together.   I know several friends though, who love to play this game alone than in a platoon. I don't myself see the interest in that, but I guess it will give you more freedom. I just myself love to move in a huge mass with other people, always managing to make people push back and supporting my teammates with either ammo or heal.   When the game was still pretty new (in the first year of it's publishment), it was poorly optimized and gaining certs (which is the free in-game currency) was nearly impossible and a long process. Now though, the game works much better and certs are easier to get, turning the game not to be so pay-to-win anymore. Sure, you need 1000 certs for a gun, but the first guns you're using is pretty much as good as the guns you can only buy with SC.   This game seriously is a must-to-try. It's an interesting game and really has some decent graphics and an amazing gameplay. When I stopped playing this game because of my low FPS, I felt like always coming back, but never being able to. But now, after getting a new computer, I'm running on semi-stable 60fps, even in huge fights. There still are some minor bugs and minus sides, but those don't really affect the gameplay that much. Only sometimes, but not usually.  9/10, you should try this out, even if you're not into huge battlefield games.",

Pros.  Free + Fun + Intense+ Awesome+ Lots of different combat scenarios. Tanks, Aircraft, Infantry, Bases, Loadouts, Large... LARGE maps, And all that mixed on different scales. sometimes you will get into 1v1 combat, sometimes 6v20, sometimes 400 v 400, sometimes 1 v 400, sometimes sniper wars, you name it.  Cons.  A powerful PC is reccomended though not mandatory. - No Helicopters =( - ^I can understand why there are no Helicopters. but they would still be cool   **As has been pointed out. This game isn't P2W. Yes you can use money to buy guns, perks, attachments, customization and other small things. All items that can boost stats can be earned in game without any RL money. Money is more of a 'shortcut' to some things. Though any moderate gamer would be able to earn even the most expensive items in just a day or two. Hardcore PS2 gamers can probably earn them faster. My original wording of 'P2W elements' was reffering to the shortcuts...  You will never play this game and feel like you were only beaten because he spends money and you didnt. unlike some games I will not mention... ArcheAge.",

            "review_text": "This game has a lot of potential, but unfortunately it has a lot of what the devs refer to as 'Quality of Life' issues.  First off, here's what the game does right. There's an incredible amount of diversity in what you can do. For infantry, there's a ton of class diversity. Infiltrators can snipe or make good usage of their cloak and SMGs to get up close and personal with the enemy. Light assaults can fly up buildings and take advantage of people's lack of situational awareness to rain C4 on them. Heavy assaults can wreck havoc with enemy vehicles and other infantry, and you also have medics and engineers which perform about as they do in other games. Infantry combat is great, and while it does need some tweaks, it's overall pretty balanced. Then there are ground vehicles, one specific tank to each empire, an all purpose 1 man vehicle, armed buggies, ATVs, troop tranports, and each empire with it's own flavor of weaponry. Again, some small balance issues, but things are largely balanced. Flying in this game is a bit different than others, and while it doesn't take long to get the hang of it, mastering it is fairly difficult. If you can get it down, though, it's easily the best way to make your presence known among your enemies. Again, there are balance issues, especially between the 3 types of combat (Infantry / Ground / Air), but overall the weapons feel pretty good and once you've learned the various quirks the game has it can be a real blast.  The bad. This game uses client side hit detection, which is not bad in and of itself, but when you combine that with any degree of latency and the game's low time to kill for most weapons, you can often be dead before you are even informed that you are under attack. This can make getting into the game extremely frustrating, as you often die before you even know what's happening. Vehicles can be an utter nightmare to infantry, even infantry equipped to fight them, as most vehicle AI weapons kill infantry so fast that you don't even have time to aim a weapon, much less charge or lock a target. But as a vehicle, if a single infantry gets near you and manages to put C4 on you, it's pretty much game over. In short, everything feels like a glass cannon, Spawn times are so short that people you have killed can be back in the fight and shooting at you before your own shields have even started to regenerate. Killing someone just doesn't feel effective because they're just going to be right back before you can even think twice about them. Logistics and tactics in the game are becoming less and less necessary as you can immediately deploy to any base that is being captured. There are vehicles in the game specifically designed to transport squads, but they're useless for those purposes because they just aren't needed.  But my main reason for not recommending this game is not gameplay design, but what the develoeprs refer to as 'Quality of life' issues. Multiple bugs are introduced with every patch, and many of them go for months upon months without seeing a fix, if they ever see a fix. The game honestly ran smoother for me in beta than it does now, despite my computer being vastly more powerful and having fewer people to render. Around March of 2014, they introduced a hit detection bug which causes anywhere between 50%-80% of my shots to do no damage, even though their server 'verifies' each hit as part of it's anti-cheat measures. Myself and several dozen other players have been reporting this and done everything we can to get the devs' attentions, but as of yet it has seen no fix, or even an acknowledgement that it's being looked into. Try playing a game where you have to land twice as many shots as your opponent does to accomplish the same effect. It's not fun.   In August, a bug was introduced that caused people leaving vehicles to be ejected into the air, often falling to their deaths. It's hilarious, sure, but imagine playing that way for more than a night. We're more than halfway through October, and there's no fix for it. It had been reported on their test servers for more than 2 weeks before the patch with the bug went live.   These are just two issues when each patch introduces a dozen more, often the same ones that then get hotfixed a week or two later as if the devs forgot to make it a part of the standard release. Patches recently have implemented half finished resource systems, altered UI elements that made upgrading things more difficult, or changed small notifications about being in a queue to take up 10% of your screen and contain less information with broken buttons. For the UI, it's like they have people changing things for no good reason without any overarching design in mind when the things already there are doing a perfectly good job. Month after month goes by with changes that are supposedly being worked on not being released, in favor of seasonal content which most players find frustrating or annoying.  As a side note, twitter and reddit are your best bets for information about the game and reporting bugs to developers. The official forums are lucky to even get patch notes.  So in short, the game has a ton of potential and offers a wide variety of combat that can be a lot of fun. Give it a shot if you want, it's free. Unfortunately, it's in the hands of people who don't understand basic concepts like not pushing out a patch that contains game breaking bugs.  Edit as of 9/10/2015: All of the bugs I complained about are still in game in some form or another, along with tons of new ones, over a year later. Avoid this game if you want a quality experience.",

I'm not going to cover what is good and bad about the game, since I'm sure it's already been done thousands of times and you can see another review for that information. I'M going to make something very clear and give you a warning. When you first start playing this game, you'll feel completely out-classed. You will die a lot, you will be confused often, and sometimes you just won't know what to do. However, at the same time, it will be an awesome experience. This game's trailers speak the truth. There are lots of players of all classes waging war against the enemy. Aircraft of all kinds will be constantly flying overhead, chasing each other in dog fights and strafing the battlefield. There will be tanks and Armored Personnel Carriers dotted throughout the escalating battles.  And while it's a cool spectacle, you will be understandably overwhelmed. 'Where is the objective? What do I do when I get there? Where is my team? Where is the enemy? Why does the announcer keep saying random stuff??? AAAHHH!'  So I - being a fellow noob - am here to give you some advice. You have to focus on one thing at a time. Yes, it's ok to take the scenery and the battle into spectacle appreciation, but don't let it crowd your focus. Listen very carefully to everything the announcer is saying. Take a minute or two to collect yourself. Ask yourself a couple things before charging into battle: 'What is the objective?' 'What is the lay of the land?' 'Is my Team's offensive large enough?' 'What kind of support do they need / how can I help?'  Next, you should try every aspect of combat. Do you want to specialize in ground combat, air combat, or heavy armor? And just because you aren't doing as good as you had hoped, don't get discouraged. EVERYTHING in Planetside 2 takes time to get good at. I for example, decided that I'm very good at a supportive role on the ground and in the air. On the ground, I'm an engineer, making sure all the tanks and other vehicles are in tip-top shape, and that every soldier has ammunition spilling out of their pockets. Or even placing turrets to provide suppressing fire. In the air, I transport troops and other much-needed reinforcements to the field of battle, and that has been one of the deciding factors in battles more than once for me.  The point is, you need to find some way that you can contribute and make a difference in the battle. But if you let your focus get away from you, you'll develop this mindset of 'charging and randomly firing will work' And that is a bad habit. You'll always die like that. You aren't just another player. If by the time you stop playing for the day, you can confidently say: 'I made a difference' Then you're doing it right.   Now get out there! The continents won't conquer themselves! You need to help!",

All these complaints are, to some greater or lesser extent, true, but I still love this game. The scale is like nothing else I've ever seen: this is a pure PvP shooter where the server is an entire planet with thousands of players rather than a single battlefield with a few dozen players at most. Infantry, ground vehicle, and air vehicle combat are all seamlessly integrated with one another. It's free, and it's perfectly viable and enjoyable to play without ever paying a cent. It has a broad and very helpful internet subculture around it. There are three different factions to choose from, alike enough that skills learned in one faction will be useful in another but different enough that there are clear pros and cons to each. I recommend everyone give this game a chance. It's free, it does a lot of things well, and there is nothing else like it.",

That being said, if you have a decent GPU this will be one of the best looking games you can play.  The basic idea is fairly uncreative and boring: Three factions fight endelessly to control the four continents of Auraxis.  The GAMEPLAY, on the other hand, can be glorious. Imagine an entire army of bombers and gunships descending upon the unsuspecting enemy base, launch troops with jetpacks, mech suits, and all manner of explosizes and shooty things. The enemy reacts with AA guns and tanks firing skyward, but are ultimately defeated.  So then what?  Well, here's where my critisisms come in. The objectives are so watered down that there is no real reason to do anything. 'PROTECT ______ TECH PLANT!' 'Why?' 'I don't know, this game has no backstory, plot, NPCs, or any sense of life to it, so go shoot things to earn monies!'  'What do I do with my monies?' Well, first of all, you're going to have to accept that experienced players will rekt you, not necessarily because they are more skillful (although that is almost always true), but because more certs (monies) = more advanced armor, weapons, grenades (which noobs don't get at all), and flashy neon camo patterns (which increase your coolness by -300%).  So if it's F2P, it's P2W, right? No. Strangely, while there is a definite advantage given to more experienced players, this game isn't really about 'winning' since no one every really wins. What it's about is getting on voice chat with some friends, going out in a Sunderer, and rekt-ing the New Conglomerate. This game is NOT about story, adventure, conquest, or COD of Duty. It's about jumping from one gunship to another 600 feet above the Warpgate.  And that is why I'd recommend it.",

It's very difficult to pull off a MMOFPS like this well, and unfortunately Daybreak falls somewhat short of the bar. In short, this game is ahead of its time. The graphics and sheer amount of activity (there's several hundred players on a given continent at any time, and each continent is similar in size to the Oblivion world) cause many players to be forced to play at minimum resolution and graphics settings, which for an FPS is detrimental because it becomes difficult to aim at distant targets. In addition, the servers frequently lag, you rarely feel as though you're accomplishing anything, and battles for control of an area (especially biospheres and tech centers) can take hours. There are no 'bot games' to play to get used to things- you are given a basic controls tutorial for your chosen faction and then dumped into the game immediately. For new players, this can be incredibly overwhelming. Throw in the fact that colors are somewhat muted and NC and TR armor looks similar at a distance, as well as friendly fire being on, and you get a huge cluster♥♥♥♥ everywhere there's fighting. It's hard to tell if you're 'winning', because there's no objectives other than 'capture this area' which can be completed by any faction at any time, provided an area is adjacent to one of their controlled areas. In summary: Too graphics intensive for most players, no sense of accomplishment, no adequate preparation for newbies, and no clear objectives other than 'kill everything that moves that isn't [insert team color here].",

            "review_text": "Note this review is very strict :P .  Planetside 2 review  I USED to like the game , now I dont. I stopped playing about 3 months since March 2014 and came back during the Hossin Continent update, in hopes of a more fun and balanced gameplay. But it dissapointed me on so many levels. I was rusty when I came back but none the less I still remember the core mechanics and how to point and shoot. I played a few hours and died a lot, but its was to be expected after 3 months of leaving the game. About 15 hours in and not only my PPH (points per hour) was still drop to a measely 500/hr but my kill death ratio per game was more or less 0.2 to 0.1, not that I'm complaining since I'm an objective based player, but there is a lot of scenarios that I would have gotten a kill and survived with heavy injuries, but still alive before this update rolled out.  The changes are noticeble, infantry shield and hp was lowered , especially noticeble on the MAX suits , weapon damage was also changed for some of them. Some of the utility or special abilities of the class was changed in term of drain/ cooldown/ effect/ power , making a significant improvement in 1 of the classes but a significant drawback for the other. Graphics wise, it still looks the same but something has been change and is eating up my pc's power. Vehicles have been change as well and their weapons as well, mostly buffed. The point system is overall the same , that or slightly better. The deathcam has been improve I guess , but only slightly. The Hossin map is still under testing phase so the constant infantry and vehicles stuck are neglible and the map itself is good , thought that area lacks people playing. The teamwork of the game have mostly been lost , and objective based gameplay is pretty non-existent , most players now just care about their kill death ratio. The factions itself is now very unbalnced as well , it was about 30% TR , 30% NC , 40% VS when I last played , now its around 60% TR 30% NC and 10% VS. Now right now I maybe sound like some VS supporter, but mind you I play as all 3 factions and my favourite is TR because of their increased firerate and magazine size. But now the factions dominance is so unbalanced it's almost impossible for other minority to recover some of their bases. TR can fight on 3 front of the continent and win 2 of them, while the rest fight on the remaining continent barely making progress. As usual SOE still kept their currency at a decent price not too high and not too low. But the charge for most of the in game item is still expensive and the progress of getting cert ( the games earnable currency ) is still very bad grinding no matter how good you are.   This is what gets me now, for all games I review based on 10 main things, the New user experience, the casual player experience, the experienced player experience, music , art style (or graphics) , price ( in this case in game microtransation items ) , progress (if the game has any) , its main theme ( multiplayer , single player , story telling , etc ) , its community , and last but not least , the MOST important thing for games, whether you are satisfied playing the game or completely hated it or mutual ( short version : fun or not).  New user (1 to 10 lvls) : Worst than before, the shield and hp system is very weak for the new user and hence they will die a lot faster and their starter weapons are not as good as they used to be.  Casual players (5 to 40 lvls) : Overall not much has changed based on what I seen , you can play normally without getting 1 shotted most of the time and an advantage will normally guarantee your 1v1 scenarios.  Experience players (41 and beyond) : Pretty much has all the infantry stuff mastered (not sure about vehicles ecause gameplay choices) , has very good gear that can overpower most low level enemy players and a very upgrade suit.  Music : Hasnt changed from what Iheard from the 3 factions, them songs is still the same I believe with TR a bit sadistic , VS and bit weird and alien like, and NC as um... western texas type of music. Weapons sounds have been change and is sounds much better now.  Graphics : No comment other than cant see cloaked inflitators while using low settings.  Price : Free but in game microtransactions are a tad bit high  Progress : Utterly slow at all levels unless you become a member, then you have a score system that actually means nothing when you think about it, cert gain is a pain as mentioned before ( exp 30 certs for a scope and 250 score pts to get 1 cert pts, so around 7500 score points to get just 1 scope) as for weapons, even longer as anyone would expect.  Main theme : It should be a competitive multiplayer on a very very very large scale. It does that well at the start but because of the unbalnced faction, its not like that anymore, you either win or lose with a landslide on the normal to large scale battles (not accounting for the 4v4 base atk and def, cuz that's not large scale :P)  Community : I chatted with the players in game, allies and enemies, visited the forums, overall quite good for a shooter, much much better than Call of Duty's community.  Fun or not: As of the Hossin update no, unless you are leveled with decent suit upgrades and weapons, new users will get destroyed no matter what, even then the unbalanced faction wars couple with slow progress makkes the game a pain to play, statistically the weapons arent overpowered when compared with the dafault ones, but when you play, you will notice that its very different in comparison. For the paid or the one with the heart to grind throught everything, its an enjoyable experience. At the based level we all deserve a free to play game that is fun right from the start, not after paying over 60USD or grinding 800 hours into the game.  Serious Score: 47. 67 % (Note: decimals dont mean anything) Normal Score: 63. 54 % dropped as of Hossin Update",

The only other thing is to watch what server you join. The way it works is when you make a character, it's permenently stuck with whatever server you choose. And since you can't move your characters, if your server happens to have almost no people playing you're pretty much stuck with it.

            "review_text": "The game is solid. I have about 38 hours on my steam account, but I've played the game for about 200-300 hours before it was on Steam.  It's a good game, you can check its undeniable qualities among good reviews around, but it has serious issues that still haven't been resolved after all these years.  - The faction balancing is very poor in regard of the Vanu; they are always (and it's been consistent for 3 to 4 years) more numerous than any other faction, which makes it almost impossible to win big battles against them, or even small skirmishes since they have the most veterans of the game.   (EDIT: I re-tried the game for the first time since a few months, and I fought (and died instantly) against swarms of Vanu players that had 20-30x more time in the game than me, so around 4000 gaming hours each. The game is now half empty, and the players left seem to be all lvl 2000-3000 Vanu veterans that will murder you without giving you a single chance of finding fun in the game. Just so it's clear.)  - You can't properly play solo to the game; if you're not with a considerable team, it's extremely complicated to join bigger squads for large battles on the fly, plus, there aren't really any chain of command, so orders either get lost or it's pure chaos, which can be fun util you go back to my first point: you can't win against Vanu if you don't organize your assault properly. Sure, you're gonna have some great moments if you try just to play alone, even in large scale assaults, but they're not gonna be enough to outgrow the constant frustrations.  - The F2P model isn't quite F2P. Sure you can stick to it and not spend a single penny on the game, and you should fare just OK. But it brings an even more massive problem:  - The progression is terribly slow. It's fun to fight and get points to spend in new skills, weapons, vehicles (aerial and terrestrial), upgrades for your shields, for the ammo you can carry, for the weapons of your vehicles, etc - until you realize that you need the SAME type of currency won in-game to unlock them all. You can't get said currency without playing a LOT - if you're outrageously lucky and proactive you can get up to 200-250 points in an hour of gameplay, but this is barely enough for two or three levels of any kind of upgrade, and I'm not even mentioning weapons, which can cost a few thousands and not be worthwile, or be completely unfairly strong.   You can get these points a LOT faster by paying the premium fee, plus a few other bonuses; the game isn't P2W, but considering the really, really, really useful and advantageous nature of the upgrades you can get for everything in the game, players who pay get a lot stronger a lot faster.  - Finally, my last point concerns the state of the server. It's actually pretty good, with a little twist: this is a massive scale FPS, making Battlefield look like a claustrophobic's nightmare; therefore, for the server to pick up the informations coming out of your PC, to transmit it to the server, and to do the same with every other character and object in the game, that takes a gargantuous amount of bandwidth; if your connexion isn't top notch, top tier, top whatever you want, you'll be gravely disadvantaged - a lot more than in any other FPS. In comparison, I have a pretty lousy connexion at the moment, which is new to me, but I fare just well in Rainbow Six Siege. In PS2 though, I'm barely more than a moving meatbag with a 'SHOOT ME' sign on his back.   So, TL;DR:   All in all, PlanetSide 2 is a good game. If you don't mind paying for the premium access (or if you're really patient), if you have large teams (like a guild or something like that) to play with at all time, if you're lucky on the amount of Vanu against you and if your connexion rocks, this game is a must. But without all that, it's gonna give you a hard time pretty much all the time. Try it (it's free after all), and make your own opinion on the game.",

Under fire bullets whizzing past your head people dropping dead left and right, but you gotta keep going gotta take that position! In the aftermath after the smoke clears you look at who made it, out of those 200+ guys you saw rushing the field a meager 75 left... and still a whole base to take. You look to your max, you charge... and in this epic moment you watch the max in his heroism fall, but you keep going the rest of you have to keep going. Finally the base is taken, the sun seems to shine once more, a buetiful sunset, but in that sunset comes another enemy... Time to bunker down! This and many more describe what kind of an adrenaline rush you get from Planetside 2, in combat it keeps you on your toes, back at base it keeps you thinking.   The only downside is the system requirements, I have a pretty solid rig after I updated my graphics card but due to only 4 gigs of ram and a factory processor that handles BF3 on ultra, I realized I'd have to update the rig even more. Planetside 2 ate all my ram, and it ate all my CPU. Leaving me loving the battles where I did not lag my way to rage heaven, extremely enjoyable, and extremely exciting.",

If you ever think you've played something like it then no, you haven't. If you think you wil be automatically good when you play it, you won't. The learning curve is incredibly steep, and the fact is that skills you learn in Planetside will not transfer over to other games, simply because the game is unlike anything else.   SOE at times seems like a mindless company. Their executive decisions are questionable to say the least, but they're managed to maintain Planetside as an enjoyable experience. Its uniiqueness is what brings it most of its flavour. That's really what killed it. Your experience playing Planetside 2 will be unlike anything you've seen. Planetside 2 is like the little girl you knew growing up. She was proper and loved by everyone in Elementary and Middle School, and especially by you, but when you got to High School she all of a sudden turned into a crack♥♥♥♥♥. Playing Planetside is similar in that you become so attached to the game (If you don't quit immediately after getting dominated constantly and refusing to learn the game) and cry when you see the incompetence of the executive team and theoretically watching your true love get ♥♥♥♥♥ by a gorilla in front of you.  The FPS mechanics in this game are among the highest tier of modern FPS games. The gunplay is smooth and feels right. There are times where you'll be fun policed by zergs, vehicles, liberators, but overall infantry fights, if you ever manage to find any, are very good, And 'If you ever manage to find any' brings us to our next paragraph.  Populations are... fluctuated. I'm lucky because Connery is the biggest server in the game and that's the server I play on. You can find a fight for the most part at any time of the day. This is different from what I've read up on other servers, and from what I've experience playing on other servers. Servers such as Matherson and Waterson (East Coast) Suffer from horrible population imbalances and there's large scales of players quitting due to the lack of fights. SOE's involvement in managing population balance is... Not really there at all.  Overall, I would recommend this game, it is a very good game at its core, regardless of the pessimistic comments you hear from hierarchial players including myself. The main problem of the game is the poor executive decisions made on it. If you can get around that then you will have an amazing experience playing the game. It's truly unique and I can guarantee you will at least have 100 hours of fun playing it if you can get around the initial curve. If you can go hardcore and get 1000 hours in, congratulations, you're a masochist.",

The temporary currency is also great, because it restricts the number of Maxes (The Exo-Suit Class, standard with a minigun and Heavy Grenade Launcher) that can be deployed. Although, the curreny is difficult as fudge to achieve if you want a new weapon or an expensive upgrade, it is a SERIOUS pain to grind the currency if your saving up for base unlocks too, costing 1000 for each base item unlock. Also, the character customization is severly limited, only allowing you to set your Faction and Face in the beginning, and only your Helmet, Body Armor, Decal, and Camo, which you need the buyable currency to unlock almost all of the customization gear, limiting players who can't afford currency to the devastatingly few helmets that are unlocked through ranking up. But it is still an amazingly massive scale game with different biomes and opponents that always keep you on your toes. So, in short, this game has its downs, but it is ASTOUNDING none the less.",

In certain spots you can go from having really great FPS to certain areas where it can drop down to like 20 which is really frustrating. Being someone who can play just about any game on max settings, it is a real mystery and one the company has addressed as an issue they plan to fix.

There are 3 big maps, and the goal of the game is to conquer enemy bases to increase your factions teritory  The biggest problem with Planetside 2 (in my opinion) is the lack of lore and story behind each of the fractions and the world it self, you dont know why you are fighting the enemy and it kind of takes away the sense of faction pride and immersion   The world is big and beautiful, but yet it feels so empty, there are nothing to do beside taking over enemy bases and driving/flying around in a world of snow, a dessert world and I cant remember the last one, which becomes boring after a while.   Every faction has unique abillities and perks, which gives a good variation, so remember to look into those - and all factions have your standard FPS classes, like enginer, scout, assault and so on.   The battles are big and epic with good music to keep the fights hectic, and its especially engaging if you plan on playing it with friends or a clan/guild!  Well enough said, I recommend this game, not because I think its something amazing, but because its free, and a decent shooter at that, which may entertain you for a while or longer, maybe for a long long time? :)  Time is the only thing you have to waste here, and hey?

Rendering distance is good, the texture quality is great and the performance of the game is fantastic! Oh and did I mention this was only on low settings? If you have a decent gaming computer then I strongly suggest you download this game. For something that is free and can keep you entertained for hours, this is the bargain of the century! This was one of my first games on Steam and I loved it since the start. BUT, every game does have their disadvantages... Thinking about downloading this game while trying to surf the web? Well think twice... the download size is huge! I literally had to wait for around 3 hours for my game to download. And once that was done, I had to go through a tutorial that had so much lag in! (That is until I changed the settings) Put those problems aside and what you have is a game where you can play with your friends and 100 other people, fighting the oppoising side in a life or death situation! Its absolutely amazing! 9/10 is what I give it",

PlanetSide 2 is an MMO, it has hundreds of players living on a small amount of global servers – but it also has twitchy combat, bullets based on real physics, and the kind of vehicle fights that demand split second reactions. Few games have combined the two concepts well. The original game used behind-the-scenes number-magic that left weapons feeling toothless and combat floaty.  I find vehicle combat even more exhilarating. No game has ever made my heart beat faster than PlanetSide 2 has. I’ve spent much of my time in the air, in the exposed bubble cockpit of the Vanu Sovereighty Scythe. The Scythe - my reaper - is a speedy, one-person fighter that I’ve outfitted as an balanced aircraft, dedicated to hunting and killing enemy fliers. I’ve hurled my violet and black steed around crags, and settled in, nose-cannon blazing, behind vast enemy dropships, then escaped under base stanchions to throw off chasing air-to-air missiles.",

Yet your main problem is the snipers and skirmishers which slip past stealthily the mountain you're deployed on. So you grab your carbine, a couple of frag grenades, some C4 and your trusty blade and use your jetpack to navigate into the canyon. Almost immediately you come under LMG fire, and you run past, ducking and hoping. You hide in a ridge, and pop up again. Beneath suppressing carbine fire you can take out the enemy infantry as they try to use the cover of ridges to make their way to your base. Yet at this range, none can match the T5 AMC for pin-point accuracy, and fall as soon as they enter your scope. All the while tracers fly overhead, planes launch devastating rocket salvos and your avoid tanks as they come hurtling pass. Yet for one of these tanks you make a rash decision. Breaking cover, you engage your jet pack and fly over the tank, on your way dropping your deadly package of C4. A few seconds later, you hit the button. Both you and the Magrider explode.

There has never been a game like Planetside before that truly was able to provide such massive battles with multiple types of land and air based vehicles and have it be playable. And yes there are organized competitive events although these usually involve hundreds of people on each team because it wouldn't be planetside 2 if it didn't involve hundreds of people. The community is excellent, with a few exceptions, and it is easy peasy to mute/block anyone you don't want to talk to. And if that doesn't sit well with him and he decides to start tking you repeatedly then you've got a good reason to /report him and choose the button for Last Killer which will automatically enter the last person to kill you. He will be punished, you can trust in that.  Cheaters, harassers get banned and the /report tool is utilized not only by the players but by the devs as well.

Meanwhile the Lasher is very deadly at long range simply for the fact that is is very hard hitting it has splash damage. (Those are Vanu Weapons) But there is a option to buy Station Cash through Steam I'll post a guide on that Btw. And don't do the tutorial it sucks. And also when you first spawn in you fill out a survey from the devs in which what type of playstyle do you prefer and after you fill out the survey you get a one free weapon (depending on the class) and a Cells camo which is pretty awesome and a 24 Hr Exp Boost. So if you like very epic battles then I highly recommened this game for anyone that loves a true Fps.",

            "review_text": "Planetside 2 is a beast of a game, boasting large multiplayer battles with flying machines, tanks, large armored flying carriers, motorbikes and other sorts of motorized madness.  The server holds three factions, the Vanus, Teran Republic and the New Conglomerate. Each faction has thier own vechiles and weapons with slight twists on all of them.  There are at least 6 or 7 classes; from heavy classes to snipers and medics to mech suits. Each class also has its own abilities; for example Light Assult has a jetpack and the Sniper class (or 'Infiltrator' or whatever its called) can cloak.  The three factions strive for dominance on one of four continets, a snowy one - Esamir, a swamp - Hossin, a desert - Indar and a temperate one - Amerish. Each continent holds at least 2,000 players (I think, at least from what I've read) which means fights can get a bit crazy. Most of the time the continent is evenly divided into three equal parts. (Unlesss it's on Indar, because there everyone fights for that one territory by the name of 'The Crown' where every faction is *really* tested.)  Each class starts out with stock weapons which are pretty decent and most of which can be upgraded to have a scope, a silencer, to fire faster, etc. Other guns can be bought from the store which cost quite a bit of in-game currency or premeium currency. Now, at this point you should know that if you want to upgrade your weapons and abilities it costs quite a bit of ingame currency. For example the 1st upgrade for Light Assults' jetpack maye be 50 pts, the the 2nd upgrade may be 150 pts, the the 3rd upgrade may be 300 pts, so on and so forth (No, those arent the actual prices I'm just tossing numbers around, the cost is way cheaper in game, I'm just using those numbers as an example.) It can becaome quite a bit of a grind at some points but its not *that* bad. In game currency is achieved from 'doing things' I guess, I dont know where I get the in-game currency from.  Your vechiles' abilties can also be upgraded, such as the shielding, the planes' or tanks' guns etc. which also costs quite a bit of in-game currency, or some premium currency.  Now, some people say to get the most out of the game you have to join this games' equivalent of a guild; this is because you can have a leader of some sort give your guild an objective and you and your guild head over to capture some facility as a single group; all prepared; flying in large groups of Flying People Carriers(called 'Galaxies'). That way it's easier to get things done; and that way you dont wander around just hoping from battle to battle. This may or may not be true, I didn't join one, but I dont really care all that much about *teamwork* or *playing with friends* or whatever.  The game at launch was notorious for being poorly optomized, I dont know about now though because I got a new computer. I hover around 50 frames on Ultra. So that's nice.

There are also multiple vehicles, tanks and airships to suit your tastes, and with a great deal of customization too, both in utility and guns.  The only downside to it is that it's almost impossible to get too many guns without having to pay real money to get them. You get in-game currency REALLY slowly, it probably takes more than 10 hours of constant fighting just to get a cheap gun, and you also have to spend the same currency to upgrade your character's perks. It's not really a 'pay to win' game, but you will definitely have advantages if you do spend some money.  Playing with friends or with a 'guild' is really important if you want to have an impact in the bigger fights, coordination is key for being succesful in this game.

Now, some people have managed to have few deaths. Vanu is smiling upon them and giving them good grace to live. Every war needs champions, but the majority in Auraxis will die in every way known to man. If you've never played this game, then you should do so to die for Vanu's enjoyment. It's free to play! What's not to like? But, here's a list of spoilers in how you'll die:  - You hit Instant Action to send you into battle. You come down in in a drop pod, it opens, you're see this beautiful world only for it all to be ripped away as a tank runs you over a second later.   - You respawn in a base, you die from a grenade immediately  - You spawn on a deployed Sunderer, you exploded from another grenade  - You respawn on same said Sunderer, an aircraft just shot you  - For some reason you respawn on said Sunderer for a third time believeing 'three times a charm' method. It explodes as soon as you spawn, debris goes everywhere, and you think 'I live, I live!' and then you die from a knife.  - You're defending a control point, you get shot in the back of the head. A medic sits there staring at your lifeless body and contemplates the meaning of life instead of reviving you.   - You respawn, you run out of the spawn room and get run over by a cloaked ATV. Didn't even see it coming.  - You go to leave the spawn again only to be sniped in the head the moment you're leaving.  - You decide to play Infiltrator, you find a nice hill, you begin shooting enemies. This is working out well! Oh wait, you just got shot by a tank from long distance.  - You jump into your own tank thinking this will go much better than being on foot. Then you get bombed by a Liberator gunship.  - You're in an open field on foot because you're out of resources for vehicles and no one will give you a ride. As you run, you fall through the ground. And you fall, and fall, and fall, and fall, and fall, falling, still falling, keep falling, more falling. At this point you realized you've entered purgatory and Vanu is laughing at your pain. This is why you're given one single grenade. There's only one way out of this.  - You spawn on a Sunderer, Sunderer kills you a millisecond later.   - You decide to spawn an aircraft thinking being up above and away from the crazy people will make you safe and the moment you do you are kamikazied by another aircraft.   Glorious times of death. Oh, did I meantion this was all friendly fire? It's totally worse when you actually begin to fight another empire. Expect worse when it's a three-way fight. This is only a small list of what's happened. The rest you must find out on your own!   Just remember one thing: Shoot your enemies and avoid your allies. Both will kill you.  10/10 would die again.",

That said the game is not very well suited for casual players, I believe. It can become highly frustrating when you just began your journey on Auraxis, but believe me when I say this: once you found some cool people to play with, it wields hours and hours of epic fights, beautiful scenery and fun ways to die.  If you find yourself completely clueless on what's going on, try one of the numerous tutorial videos around or join a squad and follow the big arrows. ",

There are multiple classes that you can play as, and when you are that class you feel like you are a part of a team because every single class is used alot through out gameplay alot and being that class requires you to do your job or your team can epicly fail and get killed. And the maps are huge and plenty of room to have multiple big battles going on at once (if not paying attetion to the map) without you realizing it. Also what i love about this game is its not always about who has the better guns and vehicles. It matters how well you work with your team and get ♥♥♥♥ done. Ive been playing this game for a while now and believe me, ive faced a battle were the odds where 3 to 1 but we won due to communication that this game does so well at making, and how well we played together. But the point im trying to make is i give this game a 10/10 for its development and know how to make it more challenging but yet also fun for the gaming community.",

In the end it's an awesome MMO, I have no hacking complains, even if they do I doubt that they will get something out of it the number of stuff happening its just too much they will get killed anyway and as I said this is a massive team game not a solo, impossible in solo mode. And dont worry about pay to play, I have some nice stuff and all for free, takes time I give you that but it's possible to get everything, the only things you actually need to pay are not important (I mean stuff like skins, voice packs, that sort of stuff that lets give tem this guys, they need income in some form) and they are still developing new features and those features like the 'recently added' Valkrie plane are available to all players and that's super nice.  a 10/10   not advisable for: -if you are a solo player or consider yourself a lone wolf on MMO's this game is not for you, the moment you go to try to steal a base if you are alone is forfeit, just don't; -it's not about just killing, if you want that this game is not for you, this is about conquering the map and massive team work  DID I MEANTION THE HUGE ♥♥♥♥ING BATTLES WITH MASSIVE TANK BATTLES, AIRCRAFT, INFANTRY AND MAYHEM *-* DID I??!

Vehicle warfare (Land and Air) x. Inspires Teamwork (playing a support class you still feel like you are helping, even if yer not on the front lines)  x. Totally not pay to win (All weapons are side grades, there is no 'win all' weapons. you pick weapons according to yer playstyle) x. In game voice comms for squads and platoons  Cons:  x. Overwhelming at first (since there is no other game on this scale) x. Pretty demanding on yer PC x. Gameplay can sometimes feel repetitive due to capture mechanics being the same x. Sometimes glitchy   Overall i'd give it a 9/10. Granted that's because i love teamwork games and the massive scale of this game. If you are not into those kinds of mechanics this game may cause too much fustration for you and feel more like a 6/10. You have been warned.",

            "review_text": "In terms of gameplay style, this is very much like Battlefield. Several classes, all with unique perks (medkits, ammo resupply, turrets, anti-vehicle weapons, cloaking, jetpacks, and more), as well as ground vehicles and air vehicles made for either transportion and combat, and one of them even acts like a tanky spawn point for spawing in for battles so you don't have to walk all over or drive to where the fighting is.  The unique aspects of Planetside 2 come from the faction system and the continents present in the game. Every faction is unique in just about every aspect, from voices available, to armor, weapons and weapon functions, and even the sound they make when you coak as an infiltrator. Each faction fights for control of the continents on the planet, and after any faction reaches 15 VP (Victory Points) on one continent, that continent is locked down and they gain a passive buff, such as health regeneration or reduced cost for air/ground vehicles. Only two continents can get locked down at a time, and they eventually unlock to be fought over once more. Battles in this game are huge, and can get VERY hectic, so expect your FPS to drop pretty fast once the fighting starts getting bigger and bigger (the game is pretty optimized though!)  Being a F2P shooter, one might expect that its pay to win but thankfully its far from it. The progression in this game doesn't change whether you pay or don't, it only becomes faster. All weapons in this game are considered side-grades, that are only bought to complement a specific playstyle rather than be a straight buff to damage or handling. While you can buy weapons with cash rather than certs, all of it is easily obtainble by just playing. You can get by in this game with just the default weapons with a few attachments of your choosing and do just fine. You buy weapons and attachments with certs, which are also used to upgrade a class of your choosing. The upgrades can be passive, like resistance to infantry arms to reduce damage, increased ammo storage, or quicker shield regen. Active upgrades, such as the jump jets for the Light Assault, allow the class to manuever in air with less downtime at higher ranks and quicker regeneration; or the Heavy Assault to get an extras shield ability that allows them to mitigate more damage.  The game lacks a proper tutorial, however, which is sort of the downfall of it. Even the Koltyr planet, meant for newbies, doesn't seem to do much as they encourage you to simply hop into battle. Still, the game is basic enough and there are plenty of guides out there to help familarize yourself with classes, their abilities, and much more. This review only glosses over some of the things in this game, there is still quite a bit of things here like base building/construction, vehicle progression (they also take certs and can be specialized!), customization, etc.  Live free in the NC!",

While it's got some nasty pay-to-win sort of stuff, a pretty hefty learning curve, and some rather unfortunate balance issues between new players, veterans, and people who just paid their way into the game, these don't make it a bad game. Though you might get annoyed occasionally (or a lot).  It's if you pull through this and keep at it long enough to become good that the game really shines. I haven't even played all that long and I can see this (under 40 hours as I write this). If you find a large battle, with 100+ people fighting, it's intense. The adrenaline pumping as you hear constant gunfire, explosions, and yelling is why I play this game. The fight for survival and victory.  The number of situations you could get in are numerous. Trapped in an outpost, cut off from the main territory, and trying to retain the fortress long enough for allied forces to assist. Infiltrating an enemy biodome as your allies are bombarding it from the outside, but not making any headway. Rolling in, driving your very own tank and plowing any infantry that get in your way. Piloting a galaxy, trying to make a reinforcement drop and trusting your gunners to take out whoever's shooting at you. Healing and reviving comrades as you're trying to win over an enemy base.  Then there are also sometimes slow points, where there are only small battles, but as boring as these can be, the big battles make up for it. And something you need to get used to if you are going to play this game. Dying. When you start out, you're at least as weak as everyone else, if not more so. It can be very annoying if you seem to constantly die, but you just have to deal with it to get to the really good gameplay.  And then a couple more points, just for whatever. VR training is great, and for those who aren't paying actual money, you can play around with anything here (including cosmetics). And those resources you have regenerate, don't be afraid to use them on vehicles, grenades, max suits, or whatever. Also, it's free. So try it yourself before you make any decisions.  Summarizing most of what I said (since some people like myself prefer to read summaries): - This game has good things and bad things. In my own opinion, the good aspects are worth toiling through the bad aspects. - When the game shines, you'll enjoy yourself. - VR training is good. - Don't be afraid to use resources. - The game is free, try it and make your own decision.",

A 48+v48+ battle is the norm and I've even been in a few three way battles which adds a new layer to the intensity. Even on this scale I don't experience debiltating lag, altough I do have a relatively high speed internet which helps a lot I'm sure. Much of the gameplay is in the vein of the battlefield series, and it shows. Classes behave in a very similar fashion and certain skirmishes play out very similar to how they would in say battlefield 4. This is not necessarily a critique though as much as a note; if you've played the recent Battlefields and didn't enjoy it, chances are you won't enjoy PlanetSide 2.  There is more asymmetry than in battlefield though, the three factions have some very unique abilities and play styles, and I'm a big fan of the heavy hitting, damage tanking, freedom fighters. The most unique of the factions is the Vanu who have floating tanks, lazer, and plasma weapons, which make for a uniquely annoying enemy army. The asymmetry is well balanced though, all the factions work well against the others and usually it just comes down to teamwork and some skill.  Honestly, most of the time it seems like a legit triple A paid release, and I don't mind shelling out what I normally pay for an excellent video game experience. Feel free to pay nothing for the whole game, you won't be punished for it, although it will take a while to progress compared to other multiplayer games, nothing abherrent though.   I've stayed for the the dusk seiges on fortesses, the air drops on facilities, and the epic defence of key control points, it's simply unlike anything I have played before. Just remember to play with some friends or join a good clan, as that's when the game is at it's best. All in all a solid and challenging game that is completely free. (Are you downloading it yet?)",

            "review_text": "As someone who delights in playing FPS games, I've got to say Planetside 2 wins my heart. There are very few games that can match the massive battlefields and give you that war-like feel. And unlike other similar MMOs, this one puts you in a large-scale warring environment and lets you either take the charge on foot as infantrymen or taking control of an armored vehicle for pushing on the land, or even take to the skies in an aircraft.  The game is played by taking over land with the assistance of other players. Controlling areas of the map is as simple as locating the terminal in the enemy base and standing near it long enough for the enemy to lose its hold and transfer to yours. There are multiple variations of bases where you can do battle, from small outposts and complexes to immense forts.  There are also multiple classes that you can play, each with their own abilities and loadouts. If you favor combat, you can be a light assault who uses a jetpack to reach strategic places a lot faster, or you can be a heavy assault and use your armament of weapons to mow down the opposition or even destroy tanks. If support is more your style, you can play a medic which lets you heal or even revive your teammates, or you can be an engineer who deploys mounted turrets and can repair allied vehicles. Do you prefer to snipe or sneak up for up-close combat? The Infiltrator could be what you're looking for, who is able to use the sniper rifle and can go invisible for a time, they're even capable of hacking enemy vehicle terminals to give your team control over them. And finally there's the heaviest class that couples as an armored vehicle: The MAX. You're a walking juggernaut, but the cost is spending resources to equip and comes with a cooldown before you can use again.  Your time playing does not go unrewarded, however, as time playing and doing various things including killing a player earns you points which you can spend on lots of stuff. You can invest your points into purchasing new weapons, upgrading weapons you own, upgrading each class to make them more effective at what they do, or even upgrading vehicles!  And lets not forget clans, or better known as armies in this game. You can join an army and coordinate tactics on a more organized scale to make even more progress for your faction.  If you like the idea of large-scale war where victory rests on teamwork and coordination, this is the game for you!",

            "review_text": "I used to play this game back when it was only on the Sony Online network back in 2012, so I have seen this game change over the years. They have added new continents, new weapons, abilities and a whole new development team. One thing remains constant however, you will die. A lot. Dying and respawning is a intergral part of this game. And you when you first start out you are probably going to spend more time looking at the respawn screen than actually shooting at people. But, little by little, if you stick with it, you will gradually get better. Earn some certs. Get slightly, ever so slightly better guns. Then get sniped by someone a hundred levels above you from three hundred meters away who has a gun they payed real money for.   That being said, if you stick with this game it can be a lot of fun. They have added a lot of new features that make this game a lot easier to get in to. Including a continent for beginners and a leveling system based on achievments to give you the certs needed to not make your character absolutely awful. Of course, once you are through with that you will be transported to the main continents where the aforementioned expert players are.   The combat itself is really fun. Shooting people in this game is so much more rewarding in this game. Mainly because the guns are really hard to use. Bullet drop, tons of recoil and spread. Somewhat low ammunition amounts. But that is what adds to the fun. The vehicles have a bit of learning curve, especially the aircraft.   This game is a free-to-play, so naturally there is a divide between the free and the paid. All of the guns can be purchased with either real money, or certs you get for completing challenges and gaining experience. But I will say this game gives you a lot of content for being free and it rarely beats you over the head with trying to get you to pay for stuff. And honestly, I eventually had to throw the developers a bone and buy a gun just because I felt bad for how many hours I had played and not given them money.   Eventually you will realize that all of you work is for naught. Mainly people in this game just rush into whatever battle they can find and not provide any real strategic advantage. You will see your compatriots begin to farm themselves by rushing into the same choke points and getting slaughtered. You will also need to get used to your 'allies' rushing infront of your gun as your fire down a hallway and getting themselves killed. You will also get run over by their vehicles. You will also get blown up by their poorly thrown grenades. You will also hop in a vehicle being piloted by someone else only for them to rush headlong into enemy fire and get you both destroyed. Ah, memories.  Honestly, you should really give it a try, you can use all the classes and all the vehicles from the start, and apparently they are going to be adding some base building content soon. Its probably the best time to get into the game, I mean, it is free after all.",

However, if you CHOOSE to go with strategy and stealth and flanking the enemy, you will have a lot of fun.    for new players i would suggest playing either engineer or infiltrator with stalker cloak. if you want to fight in vehichles pick engineer, if you want to observe how battles work and act within the game without being shot, pick infiltrator with stalker cloak.   one more thing, please use a microphone when you get this game, you need to be able to communicate with other players in your squad, platoon, or just your fellow faction members in a specific fight i.e 'guard this door guys i'll watch your back'   ALSO YOU CAN BUILD YOUR OWN BASES AND DEFEND THEM. YOU CAN ALSO ATTACK ENEMY PLAYERMADE BASES. AMAZING!!!",

            "review_text": "Ok first start the download before you read this - it'll give you something to do (the game is exceptionally good and it's worth trying atleast once)  The Planet's biggest and most popular MMOFPS - PlanetSide 2 is a marvel of technological genius. There are as with any free-to-play game pay2win 'elements' - but this largely counter-balanced by the fact that these are nothing more than 'shortcuts' to the same place. A Paying player will recieve only marginially different weapons and items. The truth is the game relies much more on how well you know 'how' to play than following some 'predestined' objective. Yes there are in-game objectives, but largely this game has evolved into a constant state of never-ending entirely PvP Warfare. There is absolutely 0 AI in this game (target dummies don't need brains after all). Everything you see is a combination of the players involved unified efforts.   Don't like team-play? Well you'll be plesantly surprised that this MMOFPS doesn't rely on preset 'teams' to get the job done, you have 3 major factions and on any given day they will go back and forth in an endless vie for control of the 4 contients. The game doesn't really rely on buddies but you can always make a quick friend in game, everybody pretty much works together whatever they are doing.   The great thing about this game is: there is an endless population boom, that has lasted since I first started playing some (months?) time ago. I had taken a leave of abscense but have recently returned to find the battlefields just as thriving and wild as the first time i played.  There is no 'wrong' way to fight this battle. If your playing you have a contribution to the team, even if it's just to distract the enemy. Was it not Sun-Tzu who said that the art of battle relies on distraction, trickery, and an open mind?  Also the in-game chat system is stellar, it's well thought out to the point that you can send the 9 most common messages a soldier would say to nearby people with just 2 keystrokes. (Among those being 'I Need Repairs','Heal me','I need a ride','I need ammo',etc...and although I rarely have time to use manners on the battlefield it also has entries for 'Sorry' and 'Thanks'.).  One thing you have to be cautious of is the enemy can hear/read most of your chat, unless it's speciifically targeted at your /squadsay, /regionsay, or such. Normal Chat has a range that's pretty short but it's long distance enough to allow for cooperation on a tactical level.  Indeed perhaps the most useful thing to understand is how resources work in this game, and DBG has simplified the resources system into 3 major 'resources' - One called 'nanites' you use these for summoning vehicles, and replacing consumables etc. One Called 'Certification Points' - you use these to get in-game skills and permanent gear. And of course there has to be a Real Money System or they don't eat so they have DBG Cash, which can be used in place of some certification points and for some cosmetics things. Nanites are awarded every few minutes, Certification Points require your active role in battle, and DBG Cash has to be bought with real-world money.  Now that I've explained how resources work, the next thing you'll want to know is that the tutorial is invaluable, go through it entirely (once it gets to the point that it suggests you end the tutorial by pressing 'I' go ahead and exit it or it'll just repeat that for awhile), You will be taught important things like how to determine friend from foe, how your classes specialize, and even how some logistics work.   So, all-in-all great game, doesn't even really feel like a FPS to be honest - it feels more like a real warzone, only the occasional yell/rant by the odd player about how their life is worthless dispels the immersive experience. But don't take my word for it, it's free-to-play - try it and see.",

PROS: 1000s of players at once FREE TO PLAY Good enough graphics for me Good gameplay NEW CONSTRUCTION SYSTEM Fun with friends  CONS: Bad optimization (TRICK: Right click Planetside 2's process, click Set Affinity then uncheck the first core or 'CPU 0') Some weapons/vehicles are OP or UP. Some P2W stuff (What can you expect? It's F2P. Requires real good PC (You can't handle 1000s of players on that old PC man.)  GAMEPLAY It's 3 factions fighting it out on a bunch of continents seeking to conquer it all. It plays like a futuristic version of Heroes and Generals. It's weapons are good but some are underpowered or overpowered. If you have some friends who have this game, you could ask them to play with you and all of you can have fun stuff to do as a squad.  GRAPHICS It's pretty cool. It's pretty much from my experience your usual 2012 game graphics.  FACTIONS The New Conglomerate is you can imagine as your typical balanced empire. The Vanu Sovereignty is the tech-savvy guy. Imagine it as that guy who sits on the PC all day and making Harry Potter stuff. The Terran Republic basically is the Soviet Union + Futuristic tech. That double-barrelled tank tho.  CLASSES Light Assault is the guy who goes around the frontlines flanking enemies. I picture him as my run and gun guy. Engineer is that guy who can build you almost anything. Combine the future with him and you got PS2's engineer. Medic is self-explanatory. Run around shooting enemies while healing your mates. Infiltrator is that creepy guy who follows you around wanting to know your secrets. In PS2 his job is slightly different. Heavy Assault is the light assault big brother. He's more better off in a head-on attack rather than flanking. Max I do not know yet. Never played him yet but due to his name I picture him as a juggernaut.  So I say this game is: (DRUM ROLL)   9/10: Worth trying.      NOTE! I HAVEN'T PLAYED THIS GAME THAT MUCH YET SO I HAVE TO PLAY MORE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE GAME. LOOK AT MY TOTAL HOURS! 18 HOURS!

Alot of people complain about balancing issues but I find that your own tactical prowess can overcome any of them unless you are fighting an opponent that is playing smarter than you are or just plain outnumbers you by a large margin. Im not sure what everyone means about pay to win. I do just fine with nothing. But to be fair, it has taken me a long time to get the certs for my upgrades. I find that part of the fun of the game though. Testing my patience with an inferior weapon or armor (or both). I suppose not everyone would find that enjoyable though. That is until they employ the superior tactics they learned with a junk weapon to a good weapon and then destroy everything that moves!  TL;DR - For a free to play MMOFPS, this is my favorite.

Each faction have different weapons and vehicles but also share some of the same weapons and vehicle weapons.  Cons.- #1 The players of the opposite factions tend to fight and argue throughout the game and I have seen some REAL hatred towards community players. One side says one thing is better then thier faction and next thing you know people are arguing and fighting with each other. But I tend to find that in everygame.  #2 Mass zerging can create a almost impossible or struggle to regain lost bases. The population does play a factor but if you can cordinate a platoon you can take over most bases if you know what you are doing.  #3 One thing about this game is that it does not hold your hand when it comes to making decision like buying weapons and upgrades. Depending on how you like to play, support, assualt, infiltrate, max ext... You should spend some time in the VR training grounds testing different weapons out and then decide which is better for you. So make sure you know what you're buying before you buy it!",

I know I always prefer getting advice from people who aren't veterans when it comes to MMOs (or fanboys/girls when it comes to regular games), so I think this is the perfect place for me to write an honest opinion on a game I'll probably end up playing hundreds of hours on.  Was very cautious about this game, for a lot of reasons. However, after playing it, I have to heartily recommend Zerg Rush Tw-er...Planetside 2. I like the upgrade system, and the surroundings...they're awesome because (a) you believeyou're on an alien world and (b) they're crafted in such a way that you can get to a base multiple ways.I believe I was about two hours in, and it was the dead of night while lasers and bullets were being fired all around the rock formation I and a couple others were hiding inside in a desert no-man's-land that I thought, 'This game is effin awesome.'  It's somewhat like an open world Battlefield in terms of gameplay, in that you can use land and air vehicles to get around in (which you will occasionally need to do if a base is too far away, or if it's just so important to you to zoom around in a tank). I do like the transport system, though it can get a little frsutrating when it won't let you go anywhere when the pickings are slim.  In terms of classes, you've got the light assault (who can use rocket boots to ascend to good vantage points), Infiltrator (snipers that turn invisible), Heavy Assault (rocket launchers and a sorta extra shield), Combat Medic (who heals and revives players), Engineer (who fixes vehicles and Max's) and MAX (a giant mech you can trudge around the battlefield, but it requires points to be able to use). A nice varied bit of classes that force teams to have a variety if they want to survive an attack/defense.  Beware, though. There is...quite a learning curve for this game. I find it (strangely enough) comparable to the Souls series, in that you spend the first couple of days doing little but dying until you start getting the hang of it.  But you will die. No matter how experienced you are or how many FPS games you've played (been FPS'ing since Doom), you will die constantly. Banish from your mind any thoughts of the twenty-man kill streaks of COD or BF, because being elite only gives you an edge instead of making you an immortal soldier that will smash through the ranks of the horde. You won't ever be some grand hero turning the tide, you'll just be one more zombie pushing against the barred gates of the mall to get at the delicious brains of the humans inside. This is a game where it's not unusual to see thirty to forty people zerg rushing an outpost, only for most of them to get slaughtered within seconds, all of you to respawn only feet away and get killed again. It sounds terrible, but it actually grows on you.  I should emphasize, even though you do use basic tactics (flanking, infiltrating teams, etc), there was never a fight I was platooned up in that didn't end with the platoon leader throwing his hands up and just telling dozens of people to rush a base. It was a little disappointing, considering how much that bit got talked up on the reviews.  It helps to have thick skin. I've only seen trash talk a couple of times (woefully pathetic trash talk, at that), but that's not where the thick skin comes in, You're going to see a metric ton of elitism, mostly by people who've unlocked the ability to shout orders and think they're suddenly Stonewall Jackson. Then there are the team kills. You will get killed by your teammates. You will get shot by your teammates, whether it be because you walked in front of them just before they fired or they're guarding a room and you walked in and startled them. You will get grenaded by your own teammates. You will get run over by your own teammates. Just remember not to take it personally.",

Even with the most potato settings you WILL NOT have good FPS after ~1h of playtime, if you haven't Alt+F4 by then.  This game is clientside, and because of poor performances, it's hell. Oh, there's nothing in place to deal with laggy players, you just have to deal with dying around corners/instantly because the other guy still hadn't rendered.  The 'super-amazing-wow' construction system the devs spent almost a year on was a death sentence. It simply kills everything the game was good about. Prolonged fights? lolno, some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ have locked the continent and now you have to wait 15 minutes for any fights worth going to to appear.  2 years ago it was fun. That fun is dead. DBG (rip SOE) don't want good games, they want money.  I still launch up the game once in a while to see what the devs managed to break each time.",

            "review_text": "I've read the reviews made about the game and I also wanted to share my +600 hours experience with you, who are just starting the game, because oh boy this game was hard to learn.   Tutorial is mostly pointless, you'll learn the game by playing it. Don't quit easy!  You won't understand the cert mechanism and you'll look at all the 1000 cert weapons and say 'How in the hell am I supposed to make that many certs?'. Believe me, you can, but it takes practise and time.  You'll suck at air fights. I still suck at air fights, it's just so hard to practise with all the people who MAX upgraded their ESFs and learned all the flank moves, but you can give it a shot.  You'll probably won't be able to kill anyone effectively at the start, eventhough you have other FPS experiences. The fights are nothing like you've seen before.  Tanks and ESFs will be your main enemy in ground fights. You'll be bombed out of nowhere. My main advice is to buy those 2 packs of C4, eventhough it will cost you a fortune at the start. They pay you back, trust me.  Starting weapons are fine. Don't go ahead and buy a 1000 cert weapon. Upgrade your suit and utility slots. The only upgrade i'd suggest you is the bolt action sniper rifles for TR and VS. NC starts with a bolt action anyways.  Playing medic is a great way to make certs, but don't forget to upgrade your healing tool.  If you're looking for a good secondary, any NS pistol should do fine. Commisioner, Underboss or Blackhand. Emissary is an interesting choice as well. TR doesn't really need another pistol because the Repeater is too good already.  Do not initiate any target you see. This is the common sense for most FPS games because your target dies within less than a second, but not in this game. If you're a LA with a carbine and you see a HA 100 meters away from you and you try to gun him down, what will happen is that he'll turn on his NMG, aim between your eyes with his long range effective LMG and kill you before you know it.   Use your utilities. C4s and Concussion Grenades are lifesavers. They can also win a fight right away. If you manage to sneak onto that Prowler(Tank) who just had his 50th killstreak and blow him up with your 2 bricks of C4, you are the hero.   There are tons of things i'm forgetting here buy you'll figure them out by yourself. This is a splendid game and probably the best FPS game that I've ever played. Go for it, try it, you won't regret.

Not so well optimized, maybe low-end PC´s could get in trouble: (For those who have a mid-end to high-end PC´s just ignore this....)  Yeah, graphics are not stunning to get you pc in trouble....but there are so many objects that your FPS might go low a little, but nothing to be worried of.... but then in a game with a lot of players your FPS could go low around 5-15 FPS lower than it was. So, think you have 45 FPS (GREAT) - a lot of players 30 FPS (GOOD enough to play) - objects ? maybe around 20 to 25 FPS (NOT enough, right? ).   The game-play: Well it´s entertaining, it has many ways to play, many types of characters, weapons, cars, quadbikes, tanks.... and a lot of other stuff that will entertain you. Maps are big enough to handle different battles.. which is good......overall it´s a good game....well it has some bugs (maybe a lot of them)..  Summary:  This Free to Play game has a good game-play experience, but when you download something this big (not that big, just 15.3 GB) you could expect better graphics... Don´t you???  Oh remember... this is a free to play game you could get better if you pay.... better in-game advantage....no better graphics... :)  With FPS I mean frames per second..... not first person shooter...",

However, it does have a very sharp learning curve which is not helped by the game pointing you towards the relatively fragile Light Assault. Like all FPS this game takes practice and the light assault is one of the less forgiving to new players.  My advice for new players is to start with Heavy Assault, its armour and shields will help you stay in the fight long enough to get you used to the game. Medics and Engineers are the next resilient and are not hampered by their specialised roles. The medic’s assault rifle is particularly effective in mid-range fire fights.  Things to keep in mind; when you pull the trigger you show up on everyone’s mini-map and if you spray and prey you will miss. Suppressors and scopes help with this but keep in mind that suppressers hurt the effectiveness of your weapon at mid to long range. My own thoughts are the increase in stealth offsets this but that's opinions are divided.  Also flash suppressors are not suppressors, they have some use but actually increase the range at which you show-up on the mini map so make sure you equip the one you intend.  Finally find an outfit that is active, it's a unit based game and solo heroes don't tend to achieve much.  ",

You can battle it out with 100's of others in 3 continents, hopefully soon to be 4 with Hossin. If you tried this game last year in December or early spring, I highly recommend you give it another try now. The game has seen seriously awesome optimization, and has enjoyed quite amount of developer action based on player feedback. While the game does have a few balancing issues, and it certainly doesn't have the best gunplay, the amazing combined arms gameplay and giant battles you find in this game CANNOT BE FOUND ANYWHERE ELSE. Furthermore, if you found the game grindy when you played it last year, the introduction of ribbon bonuses and extra vehicle destruction bonuses, and the lower prices of some really good weapons (seriously 250 cert weapons are often the best ones to use) has helped made the game more enjoyable for those strictly F2P people. The addition of a VR room to tryout anything before you buy it has also made it far better for F2P people.  If you do decide to play this game, I highly recommend that you be not afraid to ask other players for help. It can be rather intimidating at first considering the layout you can do (Although there is finally a decent tutorial, instead of just drop-podding ytou inta battle). Join an Outfit, and you will enjoy this game far more.   Overall, in light of recent optimization and the upcoming balance passes due in December, I would tell anyone who was underwhelmed or disappointed when playing this last year to reinstall and give it another try.    Also FYI, as of writing this, the 'Just Updated' is seriously outdated.

I don't know any other game that I've disliked right out of the gate as much as I disliked this one.  .....Map, mode, and other general information is confusing and non intuitive. You have to create and level a different character for each server. Once you've chosen a faction on said server you can't change that unless you want to kill that character and start over. And there are only a few servers to choose from. .....Winning depends purely on numbers, how many people are playing for your faction at that moment vs the other faction? The only exception is when air vehicles come into play. Those that can fly them well will camp the enemy spawn all day and there's little that can be done about it. If you're on the losing team you'll be camped until your spawn is taken and then chased into the next spawn, etc, etc... .....Vehicles are difficult to operate and easily destroyed while learning to operate them. They are also limited in supply so good luck getting enough seat time to master them. .....Weapons are weak and poorly excecuted. Beginner level weapons are weak against equal level players and useless against higher level players. Accuracy is a joke. .....The leveling system along with a lack of anything that attempts to balance who you play against or what you have to defend yourself, makes new players cannon fodder for those already leveled up. .....The maps themselves are confusing with poorly marked objectives.  .....Overall it's just a terrible game.",

Ive tried many guides to help me run this game better, but nothing worked. And i must say i think i have a decent enough computer to run this and even on the highest setting looks chopped up like TF2 on lowest settings possible. I know these two games are hardly comparable, but you got the point. Anyway i cant say i do not want to play this game. I think the concept of practically endless war is awesome but i have the feel that this game isnt done yet, that something important is missing and that something is, again, good optimalization. For instance, when i played the game for the first time, it was good, everything worked, but then when i ran into the battle, i got no more than 20 fps. This is a problem, but i hope theyll solve this.(I sincerely apologize for my broken apostrophe key).",

Also please keep in mind that I want this game to succeed and do well, because it has those epic moments that you truly won't find in any of the current games we have available today (Last Quarter of 2014), but after almost 2 years of playing this game and now seeing it in this state, I feel I'm going to need to go on a hiatus and wait it out to see what new features are happening before investing any more of my money and time (almost over $300 in this game from SC cards and SC membership accrued over my year and a half time...)  I have to say that the game has certainly made progress, but it is still EXTREMELY riddled with bugs, hitching, and netcode problems that haven't been fixed or addressed to a satisfactory level since it went live. Two years and we've barely just touched the surface on creating a sustainable playerbase through more functionality and metagame principles--it's truly sad. I really do love this game, keep that in mind. I guess that's why it's so hard to see it not at its full potential.  A lot of the veteran players whom I've had the priviledge of running with saw the signs far earlier than I have, and have already quit, never to return. I'm torn between my friends and the game itself, because I truly do love this game and want it to do well. It's just not at its fullest potential right now. It really isn't.  Perhaps the Playstation 4 release will help bring in necessary resources to this game, but the playerbase seems to be at an all-time low--many of whom used to be able to run the game but now can't even get past the log in screen.   As for if I would recommend this game, YES, I would definitely recommend this game for new players to try it, yes... but be forewarned that after your 100 to 200 hours ingame, you'll start to see that the fresh paint is starting to chip and crack, and you'll start to see how much of the old paint (new guns, pumpkin events, snowman events trying desperately to create an interlude from the framerate issues, buggy netcode, and other problems) has been there all along.  Good luck to both the developers of Planetside 2 and its players (both new and old alike). I'll have to check back in another year to see how things are. Crossing my fingers that this game will reach its desired goals sooner than later, because fewer players are logging in.",

            "review_text": "I've been waiting, itching to try this game for ages, so I did.... This review will turn out to be a rant, but in short: It's a game only for those who have the time and patience to get used to it.  -I tried it - I loved it. -I played it and realized I it wasn't as good as my initial impression was. -I got to witness the halloween events and finally realized this game is not worth much.  So why the change in heart? I'll try to summarize why I liked it and what changed.  I've been running around, trying all classes, running with other players - just participating in fights. So far so good.  I noticed some of starter weapons (like sniper rifle) needs a change bandly, so I looked at weapons and upgrades, in hopes adapting my weapons to my play-style, and realized that those are going to be a b**** to get. Most weapons cost 1000 certs and you get 1 cert / 250 experience you earn. To put this into perspective, that is roughly what I get by killing 1 normal enemy with 70% exp bonus. What's worse, a lot of the stats you see on the screen are REALLY deceptive, so you might buy a weapon that looks good for long ranged combat based on stats, but in reality is complete rubbish due to recoil (that is not mentioned).  This was the first real hit on my experience.  Then, halloween came! I was really excited to see what the game had to offer on events. I felt like I was playing one of those ♥♥♥♥♥♥ phone games when I saw what the devs offered on halloween.The only REAL change in the game is that you can run around like a goofball, looking for pumpkins (by the way you have to go out of your way to find a decent amount). That might sound like fun until you notice they are relatively rare and they don't REALLY give anything worthwhile until you find about 200 of them.  Then you have 'achievements' with rewards, which are devided into 4 tiers. Only last 2 tiers give actual items as rewards and to complete those you need to do 4 and 5 of following objectives (see if you can spot a problem): -Kill x people with mask on. (not a problem really). -Destroy x pumpkins. (a lot harder than it sounds, because everyone competes for kills) -Destroy a RARE pumpkin (close to impossible to find) -Obtain x masks (can only be bought with pumpkin seeds you get from pumpkins. Mind you I'm on tier 3 now - I still don't have enough to buy 1 mask and I need to buy 2). -Kill x people witha pistol that costs real money. -Kill x people with a knife that costs real money.  This was the point when I realized this won't ever be a game I take seriously: -2 of those require money, which means f2p players will never get the last tier (and that knife),  -1 of those is so rare it's close to impossible to find.... Killing one should immediatelly drop some kind of item - that's how rare it is. -Buying masks is also a bit of a hard one (that's putting it lightly) because with ~100 pumpkins destroyed (and i've actually spent time looking for them) I have got 402 seeds and the cheapest mask is 750. You need 3/4 masks at higher tiers.  To put it simply, to get everything this event offers you need to spend money AND either be insanely lucky or spend the 2 weeks looking for pumpkins.   As a side note, I checked around the forums and they've had this exact event since 2012. People complained about it being impossible to complete since then. I can only assume they don't take this kind of feedback into consideration.  So yeah... The good: -Combat and conquest thing is pretty fun. -It's fun to alter between classes.  The bad: -Steep learning curve. You really need to sit through hours/days of fails to improve. -It takes a lot of time and patience to get the weaponry and skills to suit your playstyle. -Some weapons that might be completely useless for what the stats imply they are for. -Huge accent on team play (Impossible to play alone for the most part). -Horrible holiday event design: Insane amount of boring grind AND REAL MONEY PAYWALLS.  -Devs don't care about feedback on events. -(not mentioned above) Quite a lot of trolls and such who will kill you (not neceserely by shooting you).",

When you're not dying to a Heavy Assault's pistol from across a large settlement, and realising that tampons for men are, and would, be more effective than your rockets.  PlanetSide 2 is a large scale, F2P FPS where three teams fight over a giant map when they're not walking about trying to get to said battle, and when they do get there, die to an Infiltrator that spent the time walking out of their base to come stab you in the ♥♥♥ when they could've shot you.  DeathScreen 2 has the potential to be a better game. If you spent less time looking at the death screen, and the guy with a female character with clothes tighter than David Bowies' pants in Labyrinth, you might be able to get the points to buy the better weapons that can actually fill someone with bullets and kill them. Which brings us to the next point.  PlanetoidAngle 2 has a currency called Cercs, which you use to buy weapons for each class. From what I know, you get 1 Cerc for every 100xp (?), which honestly, you can get a few depending on your luck in 1-3 lives. However, it's hard to get said Cercs when you have the starting Nerf guns, and everyone else has the Pay2Win nuclear bomb pistols that can kill you from anywhere on the map with any button.  With the concept this game has, it could be extremely fun if it wasn't as frustrating and featured more of a friendly weapon-obtaining system so you're not constantly getting mowed down by shotguns with the accuracy of a sniper rifle.  If I could, I would give the game a neutral recommendation.",

I will just say this is not an easy game to get into, but once you get your bearings it's an incredibly rewarding experience. Read on for details.  To give you an idea of the community PS has, I served the Terran Republic for 8 proud years in PS1 over Johari, then Markov, and finally Gemini with Black Company as a combat medic, rising to the outfit rank of Captain. We disrupted enemy supply lines by hot dropping in enemy territory, blowing up generators, and blocking enemy resupply runs. My first commander, 888, taught me everything I know. Our elite Galaxy transport pilot was a housewife who had to leave to make dinner when hubby got home (boo!), and we actually had a couple retired vets as mechanized infantry and air support. I realize some of that sounds absurdly epic for a video game, but it's exactly the lasting experience you get. All veteran PS players have resumes like that, and happily swap war stories as the battle rages around them.  The game itself has some flaws and bugs, but those are almost irrelevant (as long as you can actually play) since the game's true strength is in its organizational framework that makes working with other players fun and rewarding. Don't get me wrong, I really think the gameplay is strong and real money purchases are not overpowered, just look elsewhere for in-depth analysis.  I really think that if you are new and want the full experience, you MUST interact with people and join an outfit. That way you can see how the game strategies work, what bases and base installations are important, etc. Concerted operations in the game are fluid situations, you are not likely to get a strong understanding from a static online guide. If you try to solo without knowing that stuff, you will suck and quit. Once you get the hang of things you can, if you want, then leave your outfit to Lone Wolf; and you'll know enough to have fun doing it. You will have a better understanding of what the coordinated groups are trying to do, too. Or, if you're feeling lazy, you can hit Instant Action, and just go Zerging (PS jargon for joining a horde of other players and overpowering enemy positions with brute force numbers and minimal coordination).  Again, I have to stress how much being in an outfit is what makes this game great, definitely when you start - and still a great option later on. All that said, it's a time drain. I was pretty dedicated back then, nowadays I got too many other things to do to really get into an outfit, but I still jump into squads now and then and pitch into the never ending war.

It was a really amazing on how much you could do.  But, after playing for half a year, I had come to the conclusion that a game with so much potential was dying because of the developers. Pay-to-win, and couldn't balance any weapon (i.e. Buff One, Nerf Other)  I rejoined a half a year after and it's slowly getting itself back together (a bit too slow if you ask me), and I was a bit disappointed in the time of my absence on what has changed. OMF:G didn't really do much for my build, and the UI I don't really like but I've gotten used to. Esamir and Amerish redesigns are new to me so I'm enjoying those. Especially Amerish.  So I'm still definitely playing.  In conclusion, if you really want to try out this game, try it out with some friends. You'll love the experiences you will have in an open world first person shooter laughing amongst your friends while you crash your galaxy by accident killing everyone on board, rolling into hell with a sunderer and getting insta-gibbed, or team kill each other on 'accident.' Don't have any friends? Join an outfit (Like a guild in World of Warcraft).

So I'm sitting inside a base and I just spawned, so I decided be a nice guy, And I decided drop down some ammo, as well as put up an automated turret  To help of eliminate the opposing faction you no = Enemy  Well to my surprise the Guy in Front of me Falls Dead on The Ground, So I was really sort of surprise like wait a minute, im on the inside of the base..inside the Force Field?   Well after looking around to my surprised I realized that I really was inside the base, And yes I really was is in the spawn area next two and behind force fields.  So People started dropping like Flies.... And my automated turret Started taking some damage,.  Then I got shot.. yes by the way it was in a Head. The opposing faction shot me through the force field so  I decided be even nicer guy and reported by clicking on report. After while one of the opposing players yelled out metaphors as well as a bunch of nonsense. Of course everyone died and we ended up not keeping the base. So a few people on our team of ' TR ' stated that the weapons for these individuals or opposing factions, guns are overpowered their shooting as through the force fields.   So I was really curious I decide to make one of those of opposite team, you know the purple guys in the blue guys, me and my friends Tested out the guns in  VR = Virtual Reality Room, they actually have that in the game pretty cool = BUT WAIT ! We found out that the guns in theVirtual Reality Room, were not the same as when you shoot someone in the real game, the guns are how would you say different in so many words ...in damage when shooting at the opposite team yet the value damage of the gun in the Virtual Reality Room as well as when you shoot the opposing faction in the Virtual Reality Room, Does a Different Amount of Damage, for example if you shoot someone in the virtual reality room, it's definitely not the same as when you shoot them in the game.  I know this because me and my friends practiced this in the game, after we were done we deleted the characters that we it tested on,    You wanna hear something really funny... About three days pass and I really haven't played the game because a lot of us were really disgusted with the fact that they're able to shoot us inside the Force Fields, even though we were Reported this as a problem !.   The same person apparently were still in the Game still killing people the same way they very next day!   Please understand why someone like me and many other people would not play the game until they can get rid of the person.  But the reason why I am writing this letter today is because to my surprise after testing the guns and filing a complaint against the individual who was Hacking / AimBotting    Me and my friends received a suspension, .. No really I said Suspension !    And Apparently this is because of us doing the test with the guns, and discussing it out loud So they took it upon themselves to say that we were Stat Padding ?&gt; ?    I'm like really we deleted characters ?   Needless to say the Hacker is still in the Game.   We have over 1300 players in Outfit = c44x On PlanetSide 2  So Now Asked me? = After getting so many people to join, and I am Level 100 which is Max level.  I don't really get anything from Playing the game other than having fun because I am Max Level.

            "review_text": "I thought i'd rewrite my review on PS2 yet again after a massive update that has added a new construction system.  TL:DR I think the recent changes are a step in the right direction for the game, hopfully we get to see more of these in future.  Pros  + Massive Scale.  + Construction System.  + Good graphics and sound design.  + One of the better F2P models out there.   Cons  - Very CPU heavy.  - The F2P model can make the game very grindy.  - Messy design choices can make the game needlessly confusing and hard to learn.  - Classes can make the game needlessly restricting.   Planetside 2 has had a massive update which added an all new construction system and i have to say i'm impressed, the Advanced Nanite Transporter makes a return in the role of resource collector and minor base builder. You collect a resource called Cortium and the ANT deploys like a sunderer with a terminal at the back that is used to purchase structures, you generally use this to buy a cortium silo to deposit resources for your base. Cort silos are like NTU silos from the first game, they are used to power nearby structures like turrets and base modules and like the PS2 ANT it has a terminal on it for purchasing structures. Indar has also had a revamp in response to the patch with other continents to follow in the coming patches.  In addition to this there's a new victory point system that was added not long ago which i was opposed to at the time but now it makes sense, each faction has to earn 15 VPs to win the match and lock the map. My personal complaint with this is it makes the game feel more like an arena shooter and not a large-scale war game but now with the construction system i feel the VP system has a purpose. Your faction earns VPs by owning the major bases, getting a lattice link on an opposing faction's home base and capturing all the major bases (tech plants, biolabs and amp stations) will result in an instant win, winning alets is also a good way to get VP as is refining cortium as you get a VP for every 10k cortium that's placed in silos and you get XP if it's your silo. In addition to this there is a structure called a HIVE which acts as a VP generator, when you build them they start off inactive but when a large group of players on the same team as the VP gen hang around it turns on, once the VP gen is destroyed if it's active it sets off a large explosion like an ACU being destroyed in Total Annihilation and it's spiritual successors which destroys vehicles and structures aswell as killing players in a small area around the VP gen.  The mission system feels like less of a hassle now thanks to the addition of the construction system because it doesn't mark player bases, although it does update it's waypoint based on where you are on the map. Lattice is also less problematic thanks to the Indar revamp because there are fewer bases, now there aren't many connections that feel pointless which helps the flow of battles.  Squads have also been changed a little, each squad has four groups that members can be assigned to by the squad leader which can help when organising battles. Each squads has 3 sub-groups in addition to a fourth group which acts as an 'unassigned' group.  Two major problems i would like to mention are:  - The game can be very damanding on your CPU as it only uses up to 4 cores, if you intend on playing this game at the highest settings possible i reccomend getting a CPU that has fewer, stronger cores.  - PS2 is also quite fussy about what you have on your computer, if you notice your game crashing especially when it's frequent then i reccomend doing a virus scan or look for any unwanted software. Some malware can be attached to software packages like System Protector in Winzip Utilities.",

I did get really into the original planetside way back when (up until they put in giant mecha robots?), and I played PS2 when it was in open beta quite a bit, and loved it. Now I've rediscovered it for free on steam and am loving it just as much.  Planetside is not a shooter in the classical sense of the word. The maps are not little battle maps, they are continents broken up into grid with bases to capture. This is one massive war with hundreds of people involved. You will die. When you are new you will die a lot. This is not because of your equipment, but just getting used to how the environment works, how bases are set up, how steep of a slope you can climb, etc.  Your starting weapons are plenty to go face to face with vets. I've read negative reviews that say they aren't but to them I say 'git gud'. find the gun you can do it with, maybe you are more of a shotgun kind of guy, maybe you prefer to snipe like a little ♥♥♥♥♥ up in the mountains, or maybe you enjoy a nice medium range assault rifle. Get used to the fact that if populations are high there will always be someone up on that hill or up on that roof, or around the next bend. The scale of this war always amazes me. By the time you get good with a few of the starting weapons you will have plenty of points to unlock something else. What that is is entirely personal preference.  When you die, the game breaks down how good of a life you had. You are going to die. Die with glory, die with flair. Dont be afraid to run into that doorway that everyone is standing outside shooting in, shotgun blazing.  Most of the complaints about this game can be broken down into one category: want something? do it yourself. Not enough medics? so suit up, doc. No leadership guiding the masses? take the reins. No air support? Learn to fly. Be as worthless or useful as you make yourself. Even if you suck at normal FPS you can contribute solidly as an engineer, a medic, or sneaking in and capturing bases when nobody is looking.  Have fun. Die.   10/10",

            "review_text": "Whether you can push past it or not, Planetside 2 is a pay to play. I say this primarily because the gap between those who have either purchased their in-game currency for better weapons, armor, and vehicles or have worked tirelessly to earn them (which, if you choose to strive for, bravo) will likely become the most obvious aspect of playing Planetside 2 once given time. This does not mean that you cannot have fun, that's up to you after all, but it does mean that balance can quickly become non-existent in the face of a player with far superior equipment.   The lack of balance is largely due to the fact that your only way to attain new gear is severely limited to what few Certs (the games earned currency) you can make at time. If given a day of gameplay, you may earn a single gun that is usable for a single class that is still the cheapest because it was harder to make more than 300 Certs that day. Whereas, if one looks around the main website of Planetside 2, they can see that if they purchased a package costing around $60, this would increase the amount of Certs you've earned, starting gear you have, and give you a fair sum of the paid for currency. To me, this said that I had merely been playing a demo that was attempting to get me to buy the full game so I could run around with everyone else to try and fairly catch up.  This is not in the spirit of a good free to play title. Those that truely wish to seek balancing only offer vanity and other small advantages, if any, to pay to play winners while making the rest of content an equal grind to all, so that everyone's time is worth the same. In Planetside 2, the real race is to be the first to pay enough to have their time of grinding for new weapons more valuable than all the rest. Despite the opportunities to be had in this game, and the things that originally drew me to it, I regret the time I spent of my friends and my own trying to finally have a fun experience in this game instead of being met with the horrible balancing issues when one inevitably fell into the constant wars of attrition that make up the bulk of Planetside 2.  There are better games to spend precious time with your friends, ones that will respect monetary investment or lack their of. Warframe provides a much more balanced free to play system with an inevitable monetary pay in for the bare necessities that didn't make me feel dirty.",

This game is still a giant zerg vs. zerg simulator, and while that CAN lead to big, fun fights, it's more common that enemies will simply bypass one another to try and capture bases, or a small force getting completely obliterated by a vastly numerically superior enemy force. On top of that, the game takes every opportunity it can to try and convince you to spend your hard-earned money on minor upgrades and cosmetic fluff.  But beneath all that, Planetside 2 is a fun shooter with lots of toys to play with. As long as you're running with friends, you can get a lot of enjoyment out of this game. It's not P2W, and you can do just fine without spending a dime.  TL;DR: If you want to try this game, don't play alone. Don't stress about winning. Just grab some friends and go shoot some bad guys.",

The netcode is rather bad, you often get shot around corners and at long range enemies teleport around so you can't snipe them. Close range you'll easily be rofl'ed over by somone who's whether playing one of the classes that can simply take so much damage to, or have so many upgrades and so good guns that they can, just turn around and kill you as you shoot your magazine empty on them, not letting a single bullet miss. The factions don't just have comparable ups and downs, some vehicles are seriously overpowered. The main tank of one faction can oneshot every other main tank of the other factions plus is able to take multiple shot from said other main tanks PLUS is a hover tank and therefore is able to move much more freely and dodge bullets.  Aside from the frustrating deisgn decisions the game has HORRIBLE hitboxes. You can't shoot through obvious gaps, for example the area between the sunderer and the ground is bullet proof air.  Fog behaves very weird. If you run though it, your screen turns white, then back to normal, then white again and so on and so forth.  There isn't much about the huge maps. They're just huge, they're not very interesting, not all that nice to look at and the buildings are just plain pieces of metal. The interaction with the environment is very poor. You can't even jump through a window. (btw windows don't have glass, and there's only doorhinges) All you can interact with are consoles and vehicles.  Since the maps are all so empty it gets really hard to survive, because there is little cover between the bases and even if there is cover, the distances give snipers plenty of time to kill you. Basically if you don't have a vehicle you're dead meat on open fields. Inside the bases everything is so open that there's always a way for the enemy to flank you. There are so many options to flank others, that you CAN'T stay alive. There's always someone using a jump pack to get behind you, using invisibility to get a clean head shot on you or uses heavily armed aircrafts to ruin your day. Buildings are basically just pixel camps and meatgrinders. Once you managed to take the base and push the enemies into the spawn zone things get really boring: The enemy can shoot out of the spawn zone, you can't shoot in. So you camp around a corner where the enemy has to come through and hope to get a kill every once in a while.  I just didn't have fun with this game. I'm a good player, I'm an excellent player in some games, but here I never lived long enough to enjoy any of the battles i participated in. Even if I managed to totally outplay my opponents they often had an unfair advantage that took every last bit of fun.  It's just a stupid respawn simulator.",

There are 3, relatively well balanced factions with different weapons. PS2 is set on 4 massive 64km^2 warzones where the lines in the sand are frequently redrawn, and rarely owned for a long time. The maps are persistent, with the only exception being when they are 'locked' by one faction conquering the map during an alert (2 hour special event triggered by territory capture).   In my personal opinion, Planetside 2 is one of the most unique games on the market and it provides an experience replicated nowhere else, at least until Warhammer 40K: Eternal Crusade is released. I would highly recommend it for those who are seasoned shooter veterans and BF players who wouldn't mind a bigger playground to be in. If you read nothing other than this, I would highly recommend the game.   Like many games, PS2 has some upsides and some downsides.  Pros: -The experiences you will have in this game are like none other in any game on the market. This makes gameplay relatively fresh compared to many other games, with many differences from other conventional shooters.   -The core gunplay will be familiar (for the most part) if you have ever layed hands on any of the BF series of games.  -There are many various playstyles to choose from, meaning you will likely never run out of things to try unless you pigeon hole yourself to a specific role.  -This game does F2P right, with most money being spent towards cosmetics or unlocking sidegrades faster. Even with the addition of implants, PS2 is still very fair to free players. The grind is noticable, but often your stock weapons may be the ones you use the most.   -If you have ever wanted more community in a game, PS2 is full of Outfits (clans/guilds) of varying types, specializations, and skill levels. Organized gameplay is the most rewarding (both xp-wise and gameplay-wise), making squading up and joining an outfit the best way to play the game.   -Speaking of community, the game's community isn't extremely toxic like many other FPS communities. Newb questions are often answered on the official forums or on the Planetside subreddit. Even more complex questions or technical issues are answered, so don't be afraid to ask.   -Whatever Anti-Cheat DGC uses, it is incredibly effective. Almost all of their games have little to no issue with hackers, usually driving the hacking scene for these games to extinction.  EDIT: As of the release of H1Z1, people have noticed an increase in hackers on the European servers. There have also been some changes in the Anti-Cheat, so take the above 'pro' with a grain of salt.   -The developers (and ex-developers) are relatively active on social media such as twitter and reddit. They'll often post stuff about WIP or changes they may be experimenting with on the test server or their own private servers.   Now, the game does not come without its downsides, and they can be fairly hefty.  Cons: -The game is very buggy and it is not uncommon for patches to break parts of the game (hence the joke name for the company, dey break games), or exploits to appear. This is due to the complexity of an FPS and an MMO, which are polar opposites as far as game stability goes. Patches and hotfixes appear fairly quickly though, and DGC has gotten much better about build management and bug fixing. Some bugs are more persistent than others, including crazy legs.   EDIT: rip crazy legs, flail on in bug heaven  -Balance is relatively good, and DGC has been getting better, but weapons are often overnerfed and then slowly rebuffed back to usable levels. Some weapons, like HE rounds for tanks, often get nerfed repeatedly or changed. The game is the most balanced it has been since its release.   -The game is a monster of a CPU hog. Like many MMOs, PS2 requires heavy amounts of CPU power and doesn't use the GPU as much as it should. The game also leaks memory like bad plumbing, which is a problem with all Forgelight games. Its hard to get your performance optimal, but it is still possible to get 60+ FPS on 1080p if your CPU is good and you optimize your settings (just keep in mind lower isn't always better, its hard to explain).   -This game will lag, especially in the massive fights it is famous for. If you have a Comcast monopoly in your area, you probably won't be able to experience the game as you might want to. However, clientside hit detection does make up for this, but it will lead to some pretty BS deaths against laggier opponents.   -The game has probably the steepest learning curve I have seen in any FPS. Expect to die, a lot. Eventually you will improve and you will enjoy the game more and more. new player experience has improved though, and the community has a multitude of videos for new players.   -With the recent aqusition by Columbus Nova, it is hard to see where the game is going. Some say the game is setting, while others say the game will liven up and improve. It is hard to tell, so the uncertainty of the game is a definite downside at the moment.   Overall, I feel the pros outweigh the cons. The game is still being supported, it is likely that it will still have servers up for coming years. However the game's population is slowly going down, and I feel that getting very invested in the game will lead to heartbreak. I would still recommend at least trying the game, as it is free to play.",

            "review_text": "To explain this game would be...a bit hard. I'll try my best to explain how the community works to the best I can.  There are three different factions: The Terran Republic (Military Dictatorship wanting to unite the lands) The New Conglomerate (Almost total Anarchy type of freedom trying to bring freedom to all sectors) The Vanu Sovereignty (Cult of Technology)  The Terran Republic usually has the regular bullet-like technology at the beginning and basically through the game. The people who are usually these guys are rather new to the game, as I played as them at first. They don't usually get along with one another, but the players usually accomplish whatever goal they need to accomplish with good heavy infantry and Maxes (Basically mechsuits)  The New Conglomerate, to sum it up, is basically if a bunch of shotguns got together and decided to turn into people. They excel in light assault shotgunners and heavy assault, but lack stealth. The people on this faction usually are nice people, but they don't usually cooperate that much with one another (results may vary). They end up, though, helping one another in the end by basically swarming with sheer manpower and excellent air power.  The Vanu Sovereignty is a cult of technology. They have some of the better later guns while lacking in beginner equipment. From my experience, they seem to have the better people tactically and they usually all get along, but they lack manpower. The beginning guns are basically crap, but as you play more as them you unlock some of the most overpowered weapons in the game. Basically, they are good at strategy and teamwork, terrible in numbers, bad beginning guns but some of the best later guns, and better technology than the rest of the factions.  For the combat, this game is full-on chaotic at times, but can also be quiet but deadly. You can end up in just a small skirmish against another faction, but you might also end up transforming that small skirmish into a huge battle to turn the tide of the fate of the continent.  The continents can be controlled by different factions, giving certain factions certain abilities. JUST REMEMBER THAT THIS GAME IS NOT A PAY-TO-WIN GAME! The things you can get on here with money can be gained with gameplay. This isn't like any other massively multiplayer shooter. This is NOT Call of Duty or Battlefield! This game will be, instead of 32 vs 32, will be about 200 vs 200 vs 200 just in one area alone. There are many servers and with each server there are continents. Within these continents are regions and these regions are fought over. This means that there is CONSTANT war between people. These servers hold about 2000 people each, most likely more, and each continent is full of warzones. There will be kamikazes, airstrikes by other players, snipers who snipe you from the other side of the map, basically everything.  This game is fun and frustrating. I cannot stop playing, but I also cannot stop getting ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at times. The community is amazing, and this game balances the frustration of wanting to achieve as well as the fun of playing greatly. The only think I recommend is that you have a good computer to run this game.  9/10.",

Pros  Huge map  Huge intense battles Large amount of weapons and equipment  Funny people  Great Teamwork  Little to no toxic or salty players No two year olds screaming in voicechat This game is great if you are looking for huge battles filled with Teamwork and being able to turn the tables of a battle by yourself.   Cons  Requires a beefy computer  Earning in game cash (Certs) takes hours of constant farming All weapons cost 1000 certs (A large amount)  You can only get some weapons and skins by paying real money Stupid teammates (people who run you over, kill you, and all around arnt very nice teammates)  Starting weapons are weak (Opinion)  The map will not allow to to respawn on one side of the map if you have been playing on the otherside.   Anyone who says they use thir crappy computer to run the game and they get 60 Fps and it works fine is lieing. I have a $3000 gaming PC made for playing games like this and I get 20 fps with all lowest settings.   Certs take too long to get, Certs are in game cash you use to buy weapons without spending real money. To get certs you must earn 250 experience to get 1 cert. As you may have a number of ways to get EXP it will take you hours apon hours to get to 1000 certs to be able to get one single gun. And for new players who have trouble killing or finding out how to earn EXP it will take even longer.   All and all I give this game a 4/10   I like this game only because of the huge battles with so many players. But when you cant get a good FPS or get any kills the game becomes boring quickly.",

Planetside 2 features thousands of players per map, and there are 3 maps per server that you can warp between (it also features a training are where you can test guns and other gear before you purchase them and lets you practice with no cooldown on vehicles or respawn timer as well as practicing in a friendly enviroment where your not getting shot at). And it does this with almost no lag i have only lagged a tiny bit, and iv played almost 100 hours, and they are working on getting rid of that tiny bit of lag that happens when the servers get super full. I absolutely love this game, its so amazing instead of being like all those other generic shooters you cant learn where everybody sits an waits, camping doesnt work so well. you have massive maps to fight on. you really have to stratigize and work with your teamates. there are three factions to pick from. You can do basicly anything you want, drive tanks, humvee's, atv's dropships, gunships whatever, the possibilities are endless. the classes are so easy to customize to your unique play style whatever that may be. Do you want to sit back and snipe, lay down heavy fire, heal your buddies? doesnt matter there is a class for you and if the fit isnt perfect, you can customize even further. Honestly i dont think this game will ever get old, and i really think that even as great as it is, its only going to get better. the realism is amazing. and as a plus if your parents are against M games, dont worry you can still play. I love how you cant just rush the enemy base you have to work together with other squads, your tanks, and of course your air support. No matter what you want to do, there is something here for you, and dont get discouraged if you die, this is war it happens.   My advice for new players is first find your class, then play with some other more experienced players. keep your head down till you get more experience and never give up.",

And it really pushes aspects that PC gamers love, but its just depressing that its pay-to-win aspect is unfair to casual AND hardcore FPS players.  In conclusion, If your willing to spend around 60$ to get anywhere, planetside 2 might just be your new game, however, if you just want to hop in and have fun, make sure to bring alot of friends or youll find yourself horribly frustrated.

You may think that your team mate has a cool epic gun. Yeah, you are right. Can you afford it? Yea in abut 8 hours of pure grinding. But his gun has some pros and cons to your gun. Every gun is adapted for a situation and for a specific task. For example, need to cut through enemies without reloading? Dont bring a MWS-R with only 50 rounds in a mag. BRING A T7 HANDHELD MINIGUN WITH EXTENDED MAGAZINE AND NEVER RELOAD. For about 20 seconds.   There isnt much to this game than a HUGE learning curve to the weapons and vehicles. There is a huge amount of team work involved in this and beleive me it is vital when you have about roughly 150 people vs 150 people. The tide of war can easily change. One day I spent 3 hours fighting over Snowsheer Watch tower only to lose it again 2 hours later. Came back to the game a few hours later, still fighting over it. Oh by the way, battles can range from a small skirmish of about 30 people on each side to a full blown battle of around ehhhh 150- 200 people on each side.  In my opinion to start out, play as a Light assualt to get some action for a few hours. Once you have died 30 times in the same spot because you are in a massive biolab seige, try another class. I recommened a medic with the sheild regen shield. Upgrade it a few times then you got a massive Cert farmer. Just plop it down on the floor during a seige at a choke point and heal your allies then boom. Easy 100 certs in an hour. On an EXP boost event or weekends for members, ohh man the amount of certs you gain is like a new weapon every few hours or something if you grind hard.  Over all you need to learn how to play with the weapons and use them itherwise you will jst die. If you have a bad PC or laptop like mine, make sure you turn everything down low and CLEAN YOUR F.E.K.I.N.G fans otherwise it WILL BURN (I mean literally fire). Most games would rely heavily on GPU's (this does a bit) but a good CPU is needed for this because lets not forget, One map world holds 2000 players. and there are 4 map worlds. so there are around 8000 players or more that may be synced at the same time.",

Similar to the way that League of Legends handles their micro-transactions, Planetside 2 has many guns that you can unlock using 'Station Cash' which is purchased with real money. On the other hand, you can unlock all of these weapons using the certification system. Pay to WIN!? No, I haven't gotten there yet. This game also features a system that allows you to customize your soldier to your liking, you are able to buy armour that resists flak, or small arms, or even carry extra deployable items! All of these suit mods, utilities, attachments, vehicle mods, vehicle gun attachments, all cost certs, and can't be purchased using Station Cash. They are all essential to becoming a better player, and certs take time to get, so the player gets better and experiences a sense and feeling of accomplishment when they raise enough certs to finally unlock that forward grip that they wanted so that their gun could be more effective at a longer range.

I REALLY DO, its a beautiful game but that's it a busted as hell battlefield game in space with destiny esque visuals.  It needs wildlife, it needs AI, it needs to get rid of the weapon cash shop and implement it as asthetics only, it needs a complete overhaul of it's factions and their weapons. Bullet sponge enemies are REAL! you know that gif of a stick figure pumping 1000 some odd rounds into another stick figure and that stick figure just shanks him and still lives? Yeah that's this game. not to mention the zimbabwe child connections. Sliding maxes, getting shot around corners, teleporting enemies you name it.

For about a week.. or for some a month. It takes a good while to get acquainted with the game, it's factions and the players- or at least it did with me, don't know about all you social butterflies.   Usually the game gives you the option of a tutorial and then sticks you in the biggest, most bustling battle on the map, so that you may have a snowball's chance in hell of getting a kill. By yourself at some small base fight you'd have a snowball's chance in the center of a volcano, so have heart! Being in a big cluster of veterans means one of them MIGHT not look at you, or MIGHT not pay attention, long enough for you to figure out that you have a weapon and that it works.  Then comes the factions. There are three distinct factions with varying people and play styles in each, with weapons being very similar excepting a small few 'specials', each class usually getting their own special. Except the light assault. RIP Light Assault Tool- the friend we never had.  First there's the Vanu. Spandex clad alien worshipping nerds who run around yelling for batteries, and then shooting sniper rifles with no bullet drop, all while using their fancy laser guns that fire purple bolts and go 'plwlelwlplwwpwlwpwl' They also have a hover tank. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.   Then there's the Terran Republic. They have a minigun and tons of fast-ROF weapons that will make your day any day- excepting when you're fighting at a range. Then you'll get mad and frustrated, switch to another character, then encounter the same problem but with a slightly different situation.  And then Wait for it Blast beat roll  THE NEW CONGLOMERATE SPACE AMERICA We have SHOTGUNS and WEAR CARGO PANTS and HAVE COOL ARMOR BECAUSE WE JUST GOT MODERNIZED WE ALSO USE GAUSS GUNS, Stalker Fans!  WE HAVE COOL TANKS, ALWAYS YELL, AND ALWAYS USE CAPS. LIKE THIS. Then, we drive around the map on Flash ATV's and laugh at all of the other factions, insulting them and calling them silly names like 'Spandex squad' and 'Order freaks' as we go.  SO JOIN THE NEW CONGLOMERATE TODAY. OR WE'LL SPY ON YOU. MORE THAN WE ALREADY ARE.   This article as written by a xenophobic Space American who still lives on a space farm with no running nanites  Unbiased section- Grab a faction that suits your personality, load up, gear up, and go kill some people who have a slightly different ideology than you (read the lore)! One of the most fun futuristic first person land, air, and infantry game out so far. Any claim of freemium can be alleviated by a medium grind, and the game is free, so grab it and put it in your library, even if you only play it once. NOW GET OUT THERE, NEW AURAXIANS!

If there are a few EX military reading this you should have no problem knowing what those are. The most fun iv had with this game is with friends planing all these operations and plans to win a station.  If your just a small team you can make a big diffrene on the battlefield with a plan and a team.

And with four varied continents to fight across every login is different. One day you might be taking part in an armoured advance across a desert featuring hundreds of combatants in tanks, aircraft and on foot which is reminiscent of Desert Storm and the next you're skydiving with your squad mates into a hostile base right onto an objective in the middle of a firefight. I've found myself skimming the treetops of the jungles of Hossin in a Valkyrie (think Heuy Helicopter in Vietnam and you're not far wrong) and fighting through the corridors of Tech Plants trying to knock out shield generators like something out of Star Wars. With three distinct factions vying for power across four continents you can always find the fight thats right for you.  All in all the game is well rounded and you have lots of directions you can specialise in, whether its as a fighter pilot, tankie, medic, special forces or as PS2's equivalent of the Space Marine, the MAX. The battlefield however is an unforgiving place for new recruits, especially when you're not used to worrying about so many potential threats so joining a squad and later an Outfit (clan/guild) is an excellent way to stay alive and stay in the fights that matter. Earning the skills, weapons and equipment you need to be competitive isn't too labour intensive even when playing for free but earning those valuable cert points (xp) is much easier when you work as part of a team and listen to the leadership, you'll be more likely to be in the right place at the right time.  Anyway, its free to play and provided you're not afraid to adjust your style as circumstances change during a fight (sometimes your favourite tank just isn't useful!) you'll last long enough to earn plenty of cert points.

They tend to zerg, and as they are nocturnal, the Vanu army is a fearsome sight in the day, clad in purple-black pajamas of spandex and NC tears. At night, however, they are far worse. Surely you've gotten ants in your house, right? There's one scout ant, you kill him, another, destroy it too... then more, more, they're coming out of the walls, no... QUICK, BARRICADE THE DOORS! *distant gunfire* THEY'VE ENGAGED IN COMBAT! RUN! RU- *static.* (^This means they swarm cloakers. A ton. They must breed when we aren't looking.)  New Conglomerate - They're pretty cool, though their bullets tend to hit their teammates instead of their target. Proof? I was squatting on a very high sniper spot I won't tell you about, when a cloaker materialized next to me. A sniper shot from an NC player took out the cloaker, allowing me to go invisible and hide. I know because I was the only one there for TR, and no Vanu were on the map. They're freedom fighters that like to wade into battle up to the waist in bullets.  Terran Republic- Space commies. All Hail Arnold! Hasta La vista! \\ I think we have the best teamwork of the three factions, and also, best color scheme (red and blue) only problem is we need a higher server pop.

Last event was 2 months ago which is not all bad but weekly events would be nice like most mmo's do.

Positive: - 4 huge continent's to play on. - Apparently up to 2000 players per continent (so says Wiki) - Over 100 people can be fighting in one battle (I've been in a battle with over 150 people before). - 3 Factions to choose from. - Large assortment of weapons. - 6 Playable classes. - Many vehicles included.  Negative. - The 3 factions are severely unbalanced (more on that below). - The weapons are locked and you need to buy them or trade in game points for them which will be a very long time. - The faction specific vehicles are severely unbalanced (again more on that below). - Players... rude, moronic, can not play so love team killing instead and also cheaters. - Lot's of cheating.  Each faction moans how over powered the other faction is, I've played all 3 so know what I'm talking about. Ok for the factions you have: Terran Republic (TR) - (Red) - (Normal Mode) - This team is more like the imperial army from Star Wars, they are a large government that has military might and forces law and order on anyone. New Conglomerate (NC) - (Blue) - (Hard Mode) - This team is more like the rebels from Star Wars, they are a band of freedom fighters who oppose the stranglehold of the TR. Vanu Sovereignty (VS) - (Purple) - (Easy Mode) - Umm... they wear purple spandex! :/ They basically believe that using alien technology is the only way humanity can evolve.  Why are the VS Easy Mode? Well they have energy based weapons so they have no bullet drop, their faction specific aircraft is very agile and accurate. Also their faction specific Tank hovers so can move very easily and is also accurate.  Why are the TR Normal Mode? Well their weapons are very accurate but do suffer bullet drop. They are also extremely rapid with little recoil. Their faction specific tank has 2 turrets which can be fired single barrel or both together, it's also very tough. The latest release of the vehicle mounted weapon - The Gatekeeper - can fire with high accuracy, fast firing, no bullet drop, high ammo count... not nice for anyone on the receiving end of this.  Why are the NC Hard Mode? Their weapons are slow firing, lack of range or accuracy. Their faction specific tank is slow moving, single shot... in fact nothing special about it at all. The NC are apparently the 'Shotgun' group operating better with close range weapons but even their close range weapons are absolutely useless compared to the TR or even the VS! Because there is nothing good about the NC I feel that the developers hate them and just can't be bothered with them.  Now the players... what lovely people they are. If you kill someone then you get a message from them saying how crap you are, how you are a cheat or how good your sister was last night! If someone on your team is s**t and constantly getting killed, they'll kill you just to feel better even though they get no points or bonuses. Some are just pathetic f**k heads and have no I have no idea why they go around killing all their team mates. Other players can not play at all so they do the next best thing... cheat! Yes they cheat a lot in this game, from aimbots, shooting through walls to warping about all over the place. Thing is if more than 3 (I think) people report the same person then they will get banned.  Now there are a lot of negatives here but I continue to play (at least until I reach level 100) and have given this game a Thumbs Up. The reason is is that I've never played a game of this scale before. Over 100 people in one battle! Intense!  ",

Makes it hard to play but is manageable like most games. Not much of a game killer by itself.  2. New players are instant kills. As a new player, you have very few weapons to choose from and there is a level progression that unlocks better weapons and other perks to help you survive longer. But here is the catch! All those players that have been on much longer (There are level 120+ players too! o.o) have the better weapons that can mop the floor with you in just a few seconds. You on the otherhand have to unload a clip on many of these veteran players, and if you're lucky enough, that's all it will take to kill them. Did I mention they can kill you in just a few hits? Yeah good luck getting your kills and earning xp to level up. That will probably take a year to even get some decent weaponry to combat these veteran players.  I have played this game for a few hours and only got 1 or 2 kills during that time, and that was just because the guys were standing still and had their backs to me. I'm not a bad FPS player. I've played Call of Duty, Halo, and many indie games that have shooting in it and do decent to great on those games.  I like the idea of the game. it is great and with some more optimizations and balancing I think this game would be great. Right now it is decent. For those who have the high-end gaming computers it is probably great.  I do not recommend to newer players that don't have high-end computers. The better hardware might help a bit.",

(such as being able to distiguish being fired at or being fired next to by a buddy)  The PROS definetely outweigh the CONS  So in summary (before i get to more in depth descriptions of a few of my key points), its F2P... its organized chaos. its unfairly too hard and sometime too easy. its completely worth a try.  actually ive decided to finish the in depth review later... but check back in a week or two for the details!!!!",

Yes, weapons and attachments can be purchased with real money, but there are no weapons that are a direct upgrade to other weapons. When you use a different weapon in the same class (assault rifle, LMG, carbine, etc) you will sacrifice in one area to be better in another - close vs long range, large mag/slow reload vs small mag/fast reload, etc. Also, other items CANNOT be purchased with cash - ability upgrades, suit slot items, etc.  Graphically it looks pretty good, especially for DX9, but it's a bit unoptimized which really sucks for a free game. I have an FX-6300 and R9-270 and I can get a steady 45-60fps with my settings in all fights except 96v96 zergfests.  The core shooting mechanics are very solid - the game rewards good aim and trigger discipline. That being said, you will still die to 'WTF was that crap?' because this is an MMO and enemies will always be there. Usually it's a Stalker Infiltrator camping your vehicle terminal with the Blackhand sniper pistol, other times it could be a Lockdown Prowler up on a ridge shelling the crap out of your armor column.

It's like they're running through honey or something to slow them down. - Second, it's very pay to win. While you're not required to spend a dime on the game, a lot of very powerful upgrades are made avaliable by spending money on it. For example, the base building DLC, strong weapons, better guns esp on vehicles, etc. - Third, the skill cap is absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. This game is mainly played by players who have been playing Planetside 2 since its release. Now I've only had it for a few months, but nothing gets easier. When you face people with 500+ RP points its almost impossible to beat them. Not to mention someone in the mech suit with nano armor and infinite ammo. Actually a walking tank. You can't beat players who have all their classes fully upgraded, supreme weapons with attachments, vehicle upgrades and armor upgrades.

            "review_text": "Cheating if rife and due to the free-to-play nature of the game the cheats just keep coming. This game really only appeals to guys who wished they had been given dolls to dress up for christmas. SOE know it because guns you can earn by playing the game, but a new hat or a different patterned camo always costs you real money. Very clearly marketed at kids who love to play dress up.  The physics of the game are buggy as hell, vehicals flip onto their roof and explode at the slightest uneven ground and there is no way to unflip them normally leaving you in the middle of nowhere to suicide yourself rather than running for 10 minutes to the nearest fight. You are a super soldier but you can't even step over a 10cm ledge, and forget about trying to climb a slight incline - you'll slide down it to your death.  Due to client-side hit detection you are constantly getting shot around corners and through walls and shields due to other clients being hacked to ignore them or simply because the other player is lagged and their computer thinks you've been hit (also means lag switchers get away with lots of kills in this game).  The bases that you are fighting over are terribly designed and every 'improvement' that is made every few months consists of putting up more walls in the middle of no-where that make no sense. Basically as you traverse the world you can only assume it was built by idiots.  Fights are always imbalanced as people are encouraged to join the faction with the most players as you then get more resources (thus easily able to pull heavy armour, vehicles, maxes, air support, etc.) and basically then you simply take bases by constantly shooting at the spawn rooms until you win thereby not even allowing the other faction to join the fight. No skill required. Of course if you do try and choose the underdog you get less resources and if you do manage to get out of the spawn room you won't be able to pull a tank or aircraft or max because of it thereby unable to make a dent in the larger faction.  In fact the resource system is the saddest part of this game. Each faction earns resources directly proportional to the amount of bases they currently own which of course means the faction with the largest army get the largest amount of resources and can therefor pull heavy armour freely to continue to smash the smaller faction(s). What should happen is the amount of resources should be divided by the number of soldiers the faction has such that while the faction with the most bases gets the most resources if they have lots more soldiers indiviually each soldier should get less resources thereby giving the smaller army a fighting chance (which in theory with fewer soldiers each should get a larger resource share). As it currently stands the strong get stronger and the weak just keep getting shoved back base after base until they are locked in their warp gate and most of them have quit to play actual fun balanced games or have switched sides to at least lie to themselves the game is fun.  There are no tactics to be used as the game is always won by whichever faction has the most players. There is no point in ever joining the underdog team and as it's free to play you simply have a character on every faction and switch to whoever is winning (everyone does) because if you don't you won't have any fun or ever get out of a spawn room.  Also SOE keep 'tweaking' the weapons and vehicles for the worse. You spend your time and hard earned certs (and sometimes money) on a weapon or vehicle you can effectively use and then a week later it gets nerfed and suddenly you're unable to get a kill with it and of course - no refunds. You are now stuck with a weapon or vehicle that had it been nerfed in the first place you would never have bothered unlocking or buying. If I was a conspiracy theorist I'd have to be wondering if SOE do this on purpose - make a new vehicle/weapon and make it OP, wait for everyone to spend money on it, then suddenly decide it's too powerful and needs to be nerfed. It has got to the point now that AA can't even make a dent in air support even though by definition that is what it should be good at. And at the time of this review a newly introduced glorified beach buggy is able to run around destroying heavily armoured tanks. It's a complete joke.  Basically this game has zero redeeming features and even at 'free' the cost is too high. I suggest not even getting started.  Update:  SOE have attempted to tweak the resource problems, but it still hasn't changed the constant one sided fights. As per usual the 'fix' for resource came bundled with another enhancement that has made the game even worse still: Continent locking. Now 3/4 of the continents are always locked forcing all players into a single continent and therefor making the over populated team even more effective at ruining the game. At least when there were multiple contients and there was an alert the overpopped team would generally leave to play the alert and there'd be a period of time when the fights became fair and fun. Now the alerts happen on the same single unlocked continent everyone has been corralled into and so the onesided fights are just amplifed making the problem even worse than it ever was.  I continue to advise people not to start playing this horrifically unbalanced and unfun game.",

But what they don't tell you, is that it takes a RIDICULOUSLY long time. Amassing enough currency (called certs) to buy a single primary weapon can take between 10 and 100 HOURS (not minutes) of solid gameplay depending on the quality of the weapon. Before that, you're stuck with B-grade pea shooters with recoil through the roof. This makes it even HARDER to earn certs because it's HARDER to kill other people. Especially as the game is full of used-my-moms-credit-card-to-buy-the-best-weapons type people. Hardly anyone in all my hours of gameplay has not been wearing expensive camo and wielding 1000/rpm uber-machineguns. Without using real money it's extremely hard to play this game. As much as the developers try to hide it, there's no ignoring the effect micro-transactions have on gameplay.   BUT WAIT THERES MORE! On top of all this pay-to-win ♥♥♥♥ there are OTHER problems too! Before you can even START the game you have to endure an incredibly slow updater which can sometimes take an hour or more to finish. AND on top of that there are 2-10 minute loading screens everytime you spawn! AND on top of THAT the game can be extremely laggy at times DESPITE the fact that the graphics are atrocious! Jesus, I could write a whole book about how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ this game is. Oh and you can forget about teamwork and co-ordination, that died years ago. All squads do now is offer you a place to spawn and die. The vehicles are clunky and handle like rabid bulls, voice acting is pathetic, weapons sound terrible, gameplay is repetitive and uninteresting.  Basically, this game is terrible.   To conclude (because I can't be bothered writing down any more of the infinite problems with this game), though it may seem appealing at first, and will probably seem amazing for the first 20 hours, this game is NOT worth your time. Trust me, I would do anything to get back the 100 hours of my life I wasted playing this. DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME! I cannot emphasize that enough. With so many quality titles coming out, you can not afford to be playing this putrid turd of a game. ",

            "review_text": "I have played Planetside 2 for a few hours and have come to know this game as one of the most beautiful, well animated, pieces of ♥♥♥♥ I have ever played! The new motto of pay-to-win, as Planetside 2 so perfectly demonstrates, is just a way of bringing in social classes in video games. This game allows those who have ample spending cash to buy their superiority in the game leaving skill almost completely out of it. If you plan on earning your weapons and extra tech with XP, like most of us on a budget, why not take your computer mouse and insert it anally and play that way, you'll earn the required points at about the same rate and the discomfort in your rear will get you used to how the game will treat you if you choose not to give them money. Now I'm not a self entitled prick who doesn't realize this game is free-to-play, and I understand the need to reward those who pay to support, but the purchasing system is based to punish those who don’t pay. The better equipment is bought via XP credits earned by playing but if you don’t pay at a greatly reduced rate, or special credits bought only with real money or membership. To make matters worse, the price for the gear costs more credits if you use the special credits. This would be a good idea if the goal was to get players not to spend money and earn their tech, but this is not the case. It's simply greed as many of the cosmetics and avatar personalization can be bought with these special credits only. I played for about 6-7 hours one night and was rewarded 6 credits for all my play, and the next gun up for just one class of character was 200 credits. What, REALLY?!? My ire would turn to support with one simple option being available, a flat rate to pay to unlock all of the games content. But no such option exists nor is it likely to ever exist. The only option is membership at $14.99 a month, then they will allow you to level up properly while feeding you a slow drip of those special credits, meaning you’ll have to be a member awhile to get caught up. Now I don't claim to be any sort of ace gamer, casual at best, but my many years of FPS experience was completely irrelevant in this game. To cite one experience (that happened many times over) I found myself flanking a sniper. I laid about four shotgun shells into this player at point-blank range which gave him the time to change to a pistol (bought pistol, not standard issue, which is what I was playing with) and kill me from full life and shields with just 2 rounds. 2 rounds!!! Another great example was when I was defending a base on a turret, I shot at an approaching aircraft until the gun overheated (hitting on almost every shot!) and he was able to escape without even losing his aircraft. I then decided to try a back attack using the same style of aircraft I had just fought, and was shot down at blinding speed by a lone gun man and one shot. Now in case any fan (or anyone) reads this, I am aware that the game has been out for about a year now and that some of those players may have gotten most of their advance weapons and armor from just playing it from day one. To this I say;  “Great! I’m glad you enjoyed it and I’m sure you will continue to. But because of this horrible balance issue, expect the new recruits die out completely as there is no fun to be had in this game anymore for new players. Your game is destined to die and lose support as it can no longer gain new players, except for the people who have hundreds of dollars to spend on advantages in a game. And when there are no longer ‘lower class’ players (like myself) to play, their advantage will be lost, just like their interest.” So if you’re considering this game I wouldn’t bother, but if you have lots and lots of money and you want to show how that solely makes you superior to others, this is the game for you, you pretentious self absorbed ♥♥♥♥. Better hurry though, I have a feeling this game won’t survive too much longer. And if it does… I don’t think I want to live on this planet any more.  P.S. this is my first review EVER. That’s how much this game annoyed me!   Happy Virtual Hunting,   Mr. ♥♥♥♥     (Like it or hate it? Drop me a line,  Mdick.55.55@gmail.com)  ",

Think Ground to Air rockets are an infantry necessity? NOPE! Enjoy grinding 3 hours before you have enough certs to buy a vital piece of hardware and then enjoy realizing it's utterly useless because you as a soldier don't matter. Nothing you do matters because the only thing you are capable of in this so called combined arms games is slightly annoying the players in vehicles and maybe kill a few infantry if you take them by surprise or it's exactly 1 on 1. Not that you as the new guy will enjoy playing as a vehicle because you haven't yet bought... errr I mean earned the right weapons yet, You are stuck with crappy chain guns whilst the others rain down hot fire rockets on your ♥♥♥ or shred you to pieces with more accurate better gear. The most hilarious of that all is that in this futuristic space age apprantly a parachute isn't standard issue... can you guess how you get a parachute? That's right, forking over money or spend a few hours smacking into the ground as you eject from your burning no longer avian wrecks.  The three factions whilst supposed to be assymetric are quite frankly ludicriously unfair. Just take your pick between the steady aim no bullet drop hover tank or the tanks that drive on rocky terrain and shake around with every move and have bullet drop. Or maybe you'd rather have a gun with no recoil and a COF the size of a flea. Then I know which faction you are joining! Or wait no I don't actually because you can customize your character meaining I can often barely distinguish you from anything except for the tiny triangle on top of your head. So enjoy getting shot by your team mates... allot! When 20% of your deaths are caused by your own team there's something seriously wrong with the game.  Nothing matters in this game because it's an endless boring merry go round. You have no objective, nothing to work towards because your work can be undone by a single lone survivor left behind who can immediatelly start taking over the bases you just finished taking. The three continents are utterly pointless and serve no function. 90% of the bases have no purpose and are just there to give you the illusion that you are actually doing something. You go from base to base to base in a nice big circle or if you are unlucky enough to get caught in some of the countless zerg rushes going on you will enjoy defending your base tooth and nail and then getting... 0 xp reward for defending a base against innumerable odds for several hours straight... yeah this game can go choke on my disgust for it.  There's a difference between portraying a long drawn out never ending war and wasting my ♥♥♥♥ing time with pointless wanking.",

Guess what. You're still dead. Maybe you got shot in your achilles tendon or magical bullets curved around and followed you inside.) -Overpowered vehicles.  -Antitank/aircraft guns for infantry = garbage. The damage output is nonexistant the only thing you can kill with one shot is an atv. It should be called 'anti atv' instead. A tank requires 6+ rockets to destroy which will never happen when an engineer can repair the damage you did in a few seconds also enemies can hear a beeping sound everytime you autolock onto them which is stupid. Also the perk system will make it take longer to autolock onto vehicles or your rockets miss on the 1st shot which is unrealistic. On top of that air craft already get flares... so there's no need for perks to make vehicles more god mode. -Antitank/aircraft autolocks are too long and the range is garbage. Vehicles can outshoot you easily while you can't reach them with the autolocking system. -Overpowered weapons for try hards that have played this game since it came out. -Horribly placed bases. Oh it's enclosed by mountains and walls? Must be safe? Nope. Infantry can still get over the walls with jetpacks and vehicles can easily climb over the mountains and enter. Or some dont even have the over shields which allows enemy vehicles to easily enter the base and r.ape everyone.   Overall it's a badly designed game. It has serious balancing issues that need to be fixed but that probably won't happen. Stay away from this game unless you love grinding/farming in game currency (certs) to buy better gear to actually stand a chance...  Or if you do play I recommend pimping out a tank first/airplane cuz those are obviously god mode.",

And even if there is something happening, you're gonna fail to have fun with this even if you try. For the life of me I can't go one sitting without walking around the literaly 100+ square mile map that's an unforgivingly boring landscape of a frozen wasteland. I don't know what it is with people and this game, I usually am very polite with reviews but this game is just something else. And don't get me started with their 'anti-friendly-fire' they got going on, friendly fire is force enabled on all servers, and every server hosts up to about 300-1k players, (dead serious) and if you shoot too many people on your team too many times, your weapon is about as useful as the mangled Toshiba Satellite I have in my closet. Yes, I ♥♥♥♥ you not, your weapon becomes disabled on the spot after too many acts of friendly fire. I honestly can't think of a stupider way to go about ridding a game of friendly fire, you shoot too many teammates (who look strikingly similar to your enimies), and boom, you become a wet stick of dynamite, a CoD player in CS:GO, a baloon in a bag of sewing needles.  With te previous and incredibly large paragraph said, I feel it's also important to address the weapons, they're more cliche then a squad getting eaten by an alien because they split up, as these weapons are incredibly cliche for a futuristic first-person shooter game. If you want a decent future shooter, this probably isn't the way to go. Anyway, I think it is also good to mention that projectiles are completely invisible and have little damage. I ♥♥♥♥ing swear I nearly spent half an hour going through the useless tutorial which is incredibly glitchy and painful. I sometimes had to restart the game just to make it to the next objective of the tutorial!  As far as it goes, I think it is safe to say that this game is probably about as entertaining as sitting on a chair in a plain white room. You barely ever find an enemy, 99.9999999999999999999999% of the time you'll just be shooting your rifle or pistol into the forward emptiness that is the direction of the enemy base.  That just about wraps up this review, I know I only have 1.2 hours on record, but I think it's safe to say that that's a heck of enough time to make a first look desicion on a game. 'Nuff said.",

Unless you are willing to pay money, it is very hard starting up when people dominate you with their paid guns. I would rather have this game be 60 bucks and then have no in-game purchases to make things fair for players. Because this game is a pay-to-win and basically enables some people to be overpowered, I can't recommend this becasue of the difficulty playing against these players.  Edit: I have been playing video games for well over 10 years and PC games for 7 years. I went (I think)9-4 KD in a match. It isn't that I am not good, it is that my deaths were caused becasue somebody had a higher power weapon that you have to pay for. It made me frustrated when I shot the person first (and continued hitting them) but because they spent money, they had the upper hand and killed me. I kept doing the 'How did they kill me first!?!' reaction and realized that they paid for weapons. Some people might say, 'Well then just pay 60 bucks then', but that isn't the point. It doesn't matter if I pay 60 bucks because somebody would have paid 120 bucks and still be better because they had the better guns. Whoever pays the most will have the upper hand.

However you can after an extreme amount of time get most of what 'paying' will get, except the formentioned boosters.  Some weapons/upgrades are however Pay Only, however they seem to be niche more so than OP, from my limited time experiencing them.  Combat can be poor. At times one on one both players can put a clip into eachothers face and live, and other times it can be near insant death. Of course weapons made for this will vary with results, however this can be experienced with the same gun with varying results, with no explaination. (However that is semi-realistic at least right?)  Otherwise the game is poorly optimised and will tax most systems as if it were 4x as intensive as it actually is.  PROS:  You can obtain *most* things freely. But there are options you can not (excluding skins, they are somewhat usefull, but being lit up like a christmas tree they rarely matter). The biggest here is maintaining charge for the boosters.  The battles can scale from 1 on 1 to 200 v 200 in moments.  A pro and a con at the same time; squads make a huge difference and can make a battle on their own. WIthout good squads your team is likely guaranteed to fail. And with a squad, one can expect performance to scale from a 25 to 200% boost if teamwork is used. This can be a bad point too as the team without co-ordination is easily crushed and makes it heavily unbalanced. (So get some leadership fast or sink with the ship).  Conclusion:  (Opinion) The game is unique, and is worth trying, if Pay 2 Win isn't a huge sticking point for you. If it is as for many, it is painful.   The new mining offers near non combat opportunities for players to contribute to their team, although the hive system leaves a bit to be desired. Expect massive cert walls to the bases as usual, and necessary items are again cert blocked like proper anti-air or repair. (Same with anti-air for soldiers). Again, long time playing can buy you those however.  The game needs a massive performance overhaul as comparable and even far more taxing games run on a scale of 3-5x faster, so there is no excuse other than the work it would take to bring the game up to pace.",

While you do get points for succesfully killing enemies, you can get even more for staying on the points, reviving your fallen teammates, repairing vehicles and mech suits, and just generally being helpful. I don't recommend playing by yourself, however. Click 'Join Squad' when you spawn in. That will place you in a random open squad. Then, click squad deploy in the bottom right of you screen, which will place you as close as possible to your squad leader, and you're set!",

Pros: +MASSIVE battles for bases, resources, entire land masses. +Completely free to play- No need to drop a single cent if you don't want to +Very fun, fast paced gameplay with insane firefights  Cons: -Very resource heavy, and if you're not running a well built rig your game will stutter and lag, even on the lowest settings. -LEARNING CLIFF. No, seriously. CLIFF. -Can and will cause one or more of the following: Rage quitting, shouting, swearing violently, TEARS OF RAGE, heavy drinking, frequent smoke breaks, soiled pants, increased heart rate, meatsweats, sobbing quietly, anal diamonds, general hatred of everyone not on your side, and a grant fun time.   I got into this game several years ago, I saw a trailer for it and thought it looked interesting, installed it, reviewed the classes and picked my faction, got hot dropped into my first battle, and was so deeply hooked it wasn't funny. Several sleepless nights and a half crate of Monster later, I finally put the game down long enough to take a breather and just go '...♥♥♥♥ ME this game is nuts!'  The scope of the battles is unheard of in any MMO at any given time. Fire fights ranging in the 2-600 person range occur all over the map, with battles lasting HOURS at times while players fight over control of an area. You'll often find yourself in a situation where your screen is filled with tracer rounds flying back and forth and the air is thick with the sounds of explosions, automatic fire, the screams of the wounded and the shouts of the dying. Calls for ammo resupply, medics, and spot calls on enemy players creates a dynamic, confusing atmosphere that does very well in drawing you in to the game and getting your heart pounding. It's frantic, it's fun, and I've had some of the best times of my gaming life playing this game.  However, it does have its downsides. Graphical requirements are indeed intense, without a decent quality rig this game becomes completely unplayable and may cause your system to release all the magic blue smoke with a crackling pop. Though completely free to play, there is the subtle hints to spend money on the game (use SC to get your new gun now! See how much more XP you could be getting with a membership!) and some (very) mild pay to win aspects. As with all games, there are some minor glitches and bugs that can make the game quirky (random game closures and violent sound issues being the only ones that I've personally experienced.)  The initial learning curve is VERY steep (be prepared to have your lives measured in the 6-45 seconds range, at least for the first couple of hours while you get used to things) which may and certainly has caused players to shy away from the game, as there is no ingame tutorial and additional online training is rather limited. Until you get a feel for how the game plays you will be frustrated as a new player.  The game can feel a little grindy at times (Cert farming being the big one) and does occasionally feel very much like a song on repeat, the dynamic, flowing battle lines help keep things fresh (and keep the tears flowing when your squad slips quietly into another zone and completely takes it over while everyone else is busy killing one another)  All in all, I HIGHLY recommend this game, as it is an amazing game and full of insane, heart pounding good fun.",

            "review_text": "Ok, as a person who started from the Beta of PS2 and has played from then till now and still does play on and off i can finally sit down and review this game properly...  I will be rating the game on a 0 to 10 scale and giving my opinions on just about everything.  Let's start with some of the best things.  Graphics: 8 out of 10: This game looks gorgeous, even on Medium or Low graphics, and it runs at 60 FPS on my slightly older box. But, if you want the pen-ultimate looking game, this game isnt quite up to snuff, as it currently does NOT support Nvidia PhysX particles anymore, but hopefully will in the near future but it DOES look great in 3D.  Sound/Music: 7.5 out of 10: The sound effects and atmospheric music are great, Explosions sound beefy, gunfire (barring Vanu Soverenty) sounds realistic and the music tunes that play every now and again (like the redeploy screen, and about to win a hex section music pieces) are great, and each faction has it's own distinct 'musical theme' with my favorite being the hard rock pieces of the New Conglomorate. But, the voice actors for each of the base classes' callouts feels somewhat weak, each of the classes doesnt have quite a distinct enough voice, barring people with voice packs that they bought with Station Cash (this game's currency that you buy with Real Money)  Gameplay: Starting: 4.5 out of 10 Experienced: 7.5 out of 10: This section gets 2 ratings due to the extreme gap between New Players and Older Players. Out of the box, when you start you have hardly anything, and are just thrust into the game, typically at the Warpgate for your faction, and you have NO clue what to do. So, that's already kinda bad, but with the lack of teamplay that this game requires without a Squad or Outfit, you die, and die, and maybe get 1-2 kills per life, before you get the hang of just gunplay, and there's still Air and Ground Vehicle play to cover too! This game should reward new players with Double Certs for the first 5 days of their play, so they can get some of the better weapons and diversify their arsenal without needing Station Cash. As you become better at the game, you still will die, but less often and you will find the class you like to play the most and get good at it, but you should play all the classes equally to keep your enemies on their toes.   Vehicles: 6 out of 10: This game has a good variety of Vehicles to work with, from the Allmighty Sunderer which acts like a moveable spawnpoint with a healthbar, to the fast Flash which can hold 2 people, to the Valkirie which holds a small squad and can move at VERY fast speeds, Each faction also has their own Faction Specific Vehicles, both air and land varieties. But, Vehicles especially Tanks are pretty OP, you can 1-2 shot most Infantry with your explosive rounds, and are in-general pretty brokenly OP. Flashes are probably my favorate vehicle to use mainly because you can stick C-4 bricks to them and ride them up to things and watch them explode like 20 people, racking up the certs like a badass (also i can be a cool guy by not looking at the explosion [sorry that was kinda forced])  Gunplay: anywhere from 10 out of 10, to 0 out of 10: Depending on the matchup of Class + Faction you can either have the blast of your life blazing through enemies, or you can just keep on dying so bloody often. Heavy Assaults are by far the most OP class, you have essentially 3 Life Bars, and can use a Medical Kit to add practically a 4th HP bar... They are like a tank, in infantry form. Light Assault is my favorite class because it is Mobile, and has a great selection of guns, + it has C-4 Plastic Explosives, which are fun to latch on to tanks, and aircraft and watch them blow sky high!  Overall: Do I recommend this game? Wholeheartedly Yes, if you want Explosions, Gunfire, and Free. This game does it, it's like Battlefield, but Free and high tech.",

When you take one, march further down the front, and take more. It is first person, and everything you do effects the tide of war. It APPEARS pay to win, but it really isn't. I can confirm this because I went to go dump a bunch of money into my gear, and found that it really was a waste of money unless you wanted things like asthetic changes, or personal preference weapons.

            "review_text": "Planetside 2 is a MMO FPS shooter which at first may sound generic and turn you away from this game but I have to say, this is by far the best futuristic large scale FPS game to date!   At first, you will have 3 races to choose which are:  Terran Repebulic: The faction that is basically the Russian Army if it was under better management. Your goal is to restore order and wipe out the rebel scum from destroying the Republic!  New Conglomerate: The faction that is America from the 90's but with the futuristic twist. Your goal is to bring freedom to the masses and force your freedom on the other factions. Literally that's your goal.  Vanu: The faction that loves alien tech a bit too much but does bring you some benefits. Your goal is to use your alien tech to better enhance mankind and destory those who do not wish to progress this way.  When you have choosen your faction you are given some customisation options for your characters but nothing fancy just templates. After that you have to endure a very..... very boring tutorial which then LAUNCHES YOU INTO THE BIGGEST BATTLE FROM OUT OF NO WHERE WHILE YOU'RE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE THE GOD DAMN SPECIAL! It's very unforgiving if you are not prepeared.  After that, you're in and this is where the game picks up.... massively. What you should do is to find a platoon or a squad so you can work together to capture objectives and earn certification points + XP alot faster. This game is clearly meant to be played with others so having a mic and knowing how to use it is just as important as knowing how to use your weapon. Also having a decent vechile is also very important since the maps are Gigantic, walking 24/7 is not an option in this game. Overall though once you give this game a chance you will start to be involved in some massive engagements that will make you feel either amazing or confused and annoyed.  Now there is a downside to this game which really will turn alot of people away, microtransactions and weapon purchasing. The currency for this game is called Station Cash (SC) where you trade really money for SC (£20 = 2000 SC). Now I don't really have a problem with this but when the weapons cost about 750 SC+ each then that is way too expensive! Especially when most of the weapons look exactly the same, just the stats are different which is a little insulting in my opinion. Also if you don't intend to buy any station cash, you can still buy weapons with certification points but usally a single weapon will cost you about 1000 Certs which is alot since you only get about 20 - 75 certs per hour. Just to add the cherry on top, every faction has there own specific weapons so if you intend to use an NC weapon for the TR then good luck to ya!  Outside that frustratingly bad part though, the game is completely free which is great! I feel that if it wasn't free and this was still happening then there would be a massive issue which would kill this game completely.   Ultimately though, this game is defeniately worth a checkout if you enjoy BF4 or any large scale FPS's. It will take you a couple of hours to get use to the feel of the gameplay but in the end you should have a blast!  ===============================================================================  TL:DR - Definately worth a play through for large scale FPS fans even with it's mircotransaction flaws  ===============================================================================    ",

Scale: In Call of Duty, maps are often 6v6 (i may be wrong) and on Battlefield its 32v32, well in Planetside 2 its typically in the area of ~100v100, with larger battles being much, much larger  2. Map size: in Call of Duty maps are about 200x200 meters (i may be wrong) and in Battlefield its about 1500x1500 meters, in Planetside its 8000x8000 meters, and there is 4 of 'em now, with battles raging constantly, on each of them  3. Cost, how much did you pay for Call of Duty or/and Battlefield4? SOE asks nothing  So what are you waiting for?  Now for the more constructive portion of this...  You don't 'unlock' guns and attachments as you level up or use that particular gun for a period of time, you unlock them with the ingame currency known as 'Certs', you gain 'Certs' as you wage battle with your enemies, and progressively you pooled a significant amount of it, you can 'buy' a gun or attachments, or upgrade your class' pasives  War on Auraxis is waged between 3 factions  The New Conglamourate Terran Republic Vanu Sovereignty  The New Conglamourate (NC for short) is bent on being free from any forms of oppression, believing that a life lived in chains is a life not lived at all.  The Terran Republic (TR for short) wants to ensure that life is civilized on Auraxis and a goverment can be established so life would be boring and so on (pay taxes, rent and so on).  The Vanu Sovereignty (VS for short) wants to learn the secrets of the Alien technology to further their research and make weapons, more effecient  The attension of detail is very good, better than most to be honest and i must also say, its quite something to be part of battles the scale that they are on Planetside 2  In the first few days, don't expect to much on the area of unlocks and 'promotions' Battle ranks are far and few between (the level cap is at BattleRank (BR) 100)  The Comunity is very freindly, mature and most helpful.

Pros: The servers are so big that there is very little possibility of a map dominating hacker (a problem that is severely under-reported). That said, the maps being BIG is a plus all on its own. The map sizes lead to some really fun confrontations. It leads a group (or individual) to use strategy in their attacks. Do you go in guns blazing or pick them off one by one? The class customization is well balanced and the sci-fi graphics are beautiful.  Cons: For my experience, there were few but fatal flaws in the game. The gameplay is not the problem, it is the way the game was made. The servers are prone to CtDs very easily. On a good day, I get 15 minutes of time on a game before it crashes and I have to start it up again. Now there are premium servers which crash less, but of course. THEY AINT CHEAP",

The Free-to-Play model is the most ideal 'Freemium' model around; there is no Pay-to-Win as is common with many similar games, everything can be unlocked with Cert points earned through normal gameplay (barring nonessential items such as camos that can only be unlocked via real life cash).  The community as whole is pretty great, I've met tons of friends through platoons and outfits I've been a part of.  Gameplay itself is overall pretty polished and smooth, although every patch seems to bring its fair share of bugs, not unheard of in a large game like this.  My one gripe is how unoptimized the engine is for PC, its intensely CPU reliant, at times your high-end GPU will only get you so far. But things are slowly improving with updates. By no means let that turn you off from the great experience PS2 is capapble of delivering.  I kick myself for not discovering Planetside sooner. Play it.",

No longer about skill or reaction time, it's just about wether or not your high leveled or not. If your not well then goodluck. I can literally unload two whole clips into one guy and still wont kill him. He shoots me once I die instantly. Not really sure how that's considered balanced. Don't get me wrong it's a very well designed game and beautyful graphics and everything. It's just not easy for anyone who hasnt played for the past year or dont have the money to unlock everything. If a system was added so people that were like level 1 - 15 could play just with each other instead of people whom are level 100 with everything unlocked and all maxed out it would be fantastic. Also it takes 1000 certs to unlock a new gun. For a new player thats about a 20 to 30 hour grind if they are lucky. All I'm saying is just make it balanced for the low level players.",

It's a game that has me frustratingly taking it off of my list then putting it back on within a few months.  The gameplay revolves around conquest-style persistent map spanning four continents and thousands of players. This is Battlefield on steroids. Once you join up and have your first major alert or large-scale battle you'll be hooked. It's a beautiful game with some rock-solid balancing going on constantly. It's the best MMO I've ever played for sure.  The paying part of the game isn't necessary if you put many hours into it (except for cosmetics and faster unlocks) but I would suggest buying a few cosmetics just to stand out from the peons. It's worth the effort, believe me.  There are a few serious issues that make the game almost unplayable. The short TTKs can be frustrating at first, and the game is largely unforgiving in terms of tutorials. The steep learning curve may turn off some players. For those it does not turn off prepare for a terrible community both in-game and in forums, and an even worse developing cycle in which promises are constantly broken and information is fudged. This isn't a game you want to go to the forums about. The metagame is still being tinkered with, and hopefully by the fall of 2014 will be in place.  I'd give this a go if you enjoy any sort of multiplayer large-scale battles, as it does those in aces during primetime. Just make sure not to get put down by the terrible community and developers.",

            "review_text": "First off, as you can see from the decent amount of hours i've wasted on this game, I think it is pretty good. Many oppurtunites to troll people, many oppurtunites to be trolled, and countless headshots to be made. That being said, my personal favorite weapon is the AF-8 Railjack.   Now, down to business, this game is amazing, even on its lowest graphics setting. The gameplay is smooth and there are only about 10 hackers at any given time across the entire game. Aimbot is nowhere to be found, and ironsights often win the day. Grenades fly thru window openings just to ricochet off of crates back outside, and even though a MAX is a walking tank, it still get blown up nicely with a pack or two of c4 (or an anti-tank mine). Side note: took me about a full week to figure out that higby was actually the f word being censored (thank you devs).   Snipers make up about 33% of the total player population, so if you're looking to make some headshots, be prepared to take a few of those yourself. Light assaults make up the bulk of the initial assault forces, with heavy assaults trailing right behing, with medics and engineers throughout their midst. MAXes trod along well behind, their bulky armor hindering their maneuverability. Snipers hang far back while they pick off enemies at a distance (or rush ahead under cloak to lay tank mines ON tanks), all in all an excellent gameplay experience... BUT WAIT!!!  I'm sorry, I forgot about the ONE THING that all Planetside 2 players have in common, the need to be glory hounds. Yes my fellow comrades, it's completely true, once you get on the battlefield you try to rack up as many kills as possible before dying, sometimes failing to even move an inch before a well placed sniper picks you off as you spawn next to the sundy. This has lead to many mad attempts at revenge, only to be picked off by auto-turrets and heavy assaults in the process. Tempers run short and craftiness runs deep as players do everything they can to get an edge for their faction in combat. Whether it is parking their sundy inside of a defense tower, or perching atop a high-rise plateau to get a sniper's perspective of the battlefield, players are doing whatever they can to make sure that YOU, yes I mean YOU specifically don't make it past their base walls. Anti-personal mines lay in wait as you cross into the base, detonating and releasing a hailstorm of shrapnel as you press on through. And that's not even the best part.  Sometimes, if your lucky enough, you'll get put in a galaxy or libby that has a screwup for a pilot who rams into EVERYTHING. Yeah, I suck at flying as well. I've been in my share of fails as well, where the pilot miscalculates and rams headfirst into a mountain, or the ground (if he's THAT bad). Tank to Phalanx Turret combat is extremely frequent, and often ends in silent raging for many. Also doesn't help when someone with a good aim with turrets (like myself) enters one and starts sniping random enemies from a distance. Such fun! Pistols are a core part of the game as well, for who wouldn't gladly switch to a tiny revolver when he guns out of ammo for his big gatling gun? I sure would, as pistols have saved my life quite a few times.  All in all 10/10 cause great fails in this game xD   [Rate this review funny please]  ",

However, if you approach it like you would Halo, or Call of Duty, or Medal of Honor, I think you'll find it lacking. It's much more than just a shooter.  It is a team-based game. If you run off alone, you'll die and be frustrated. If you stick with a team they'll keep you alive, supplied with ammo, and provide other perks (like spotting enemies on your minimap) that make playing easier and much more fun.  I think a key aspect that people often overlook is that when you die, it's pretty easy to switch classes to something more effective to the situation at hand. If your base is being swarmed by tanks, you'll probably want to spawn as a Heavy Assault and use your rocket launcher to take them out. If you're trying to take a walled-off base, and the gate is heavily guarded, switch to a Light Assault and fly over the wall.   This game is entirely free to play. It is not pay to win. You can buy different weapons with money, or purchase them through in-game currency called certifications. You get certifications just by playing (healing team mates, supplying them with ammo, repairing vehicles, killing enemies, taking bases, etc). The weapons grant you more choices, but the default weapons for each class are more than adequate.   If a new player spent $5000 on this game, they would not have any greater chance of making a difference on the battlefield than a player that didn't.   ",

Dont like the fact you have to level up just to get in any decent vehicle.

That a new player's first few bleak, infuriating hours being dropped into the middle of a warzone could be offset by the promise of some of the most incredible spectacles of warfare ever depicted in a game.  Yeah, well I was too generous. This game is f*cking appalling. In fact, it might be the single worst game I have ever played. Not because it isn't utterly beautiful to look at, or isn't full of incredible potential; but because how much of its potential is squandered. Mercilessly and repeatedly.  Your first experience of this game, past the hateful, broken tutorial, is being dropped into the middle of 'solo' play, which even Planetside's pathologically sycophantic community unanimously describe as 'really not very fun'. It's a miserable, directionless zergfest of epic proportions, in which tactics play almost no role at all, and attrition reigns supreme. You can join a squad, but all that really achieves is a few markers on your HUD and a measly exp boost. Your squad will likely be as directionless, bored and confused as you are, because that's all you can ever be while playing the game this way.  The 'REAL' way to play the game is to join an 'outfit', or a clan by any other name. This sounds like a great idea, but it's where the game's problems really begin to surface. Unless you're a high-ranked player with excellent twitch skill and kill-to-death ratio, then you can be one of three things - a medic, an engineer, or a burden. This hierarchy makes it incredibly difficult for new or less skilled players to actually enjoy the game. Repairing turrets and healing other players is tedious and thankless, and considering most players who signed up for this game wanted to play an FPS, it strikes me as a gallingly bad investment of leisure time.  It's been said by the developers that the game experiences a huge amount of 'churn' in terms of new players - that an overwhelming majority of players give up entirely before they reach Rank 8. Often in the past, on the Daybreak forums and on PS2's official Reddit, new players would air grievances similar to this rant/review, only to be branded as 'whiners and quitters'. This outright hostility to new players is perhaps the blackest mark of all against this game. While free-to-play, I nevertheless ended up regretting playing this game, not because it's a waste of money, but because it's a colossal waste of time. I regret every minute I spent playing this f*cking atrocity.",

You can lead a charge of 100 people, or capture a base all by yourself.   HOWEVER: The game is probably a 4/5 in my book all because of some bugs, that can kill you during your best round. I warn you though, the community will give you cancer. The game has more elitists than noobs. Stay away from the subreddit and do not talk to any of the players on /yell. If you play Vanu everyone will hate you, if you play NC everyone calls you a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ who is incapable of using anything other than a Max, and if You play TR you will be too OP. Teamkillers are EVERYWHERE.   Trust me, I got teamkilled because I reached a vehicle terminal before another player, some people drop c4 in choke points, killing your only defenses, and one guy chased me around with a pistol and followed me until he killed me. I've been trampled by medics, and ignored by engineers who drop ammo.  For the love of God, stay away from people and this game will be fantastic.",

Every class has advantages or disadvantages and you will surely, like everybody, change class frequently to support in a way or another your 'Factionmates' ...   The BEST THING in this game is...

The game is in NO WAY a PAY TO WIN... Arsenal you can buy from the store is far from being 'Twicked' and are most of the time, either only a little better or just plainly balanced. But may give you an edge if you chose them well 'compare you own style' of playing. You mainly pay for 'style/appearence' because you just want to show off a few things  That's why it's one of my fav game, and I'm not yet telling about all the good sides of the game... The bad sides... there's a few, like the fact there's only 3 Factions, there's only 4+1 Infantry classes, 4/5 ground vehicles and 4/5 air vehicles and only 2 styles of wall turrets being usable and 'only' about 60 types of wepons... and all this could be improved...

You are better off being in squad,platoon,etc. Another thing is this the leader get's all the glory because they know they get's tons of certs,XP,etc...Just sit back do nothing so watch who you join while 'YOU' the true infantry do all the hard work of which you get better certs,XP but the leader still get's more while he hardly do anything...I know just press 'TAB' you will see what I mean just barking orders....Don't get me wrong it's fun if with the right people &amp; platoon...You ask me needs allot of work still of true balance of the game.",

Customizability is pretty decent in this piece, however i've noticed little stronger pay 2 win basis, but afterall it wont really drastically impact your gameplay, you can still customize your weapons with very acceptable skills and points gaining speed  Pros of this beauty: - Tredemenously huge scale maps and battles (64 vs 64 battles, AND EVER LARGER ) - Very good optimilization - Dynamic and persistent world, battlefield constantly reforms between three sides, you'd practically have trouble to encounter same firefight at same place - Great variety of weapons - Sound design is moderately juicy, graphical design is very decent - Mediocore immersion - Quality feeling content, nothing cheap-feeling - Decent attention to detail  CONS of this beauty : - We know it's free2play, however having camouflages obtainable possibly mainly by cash is bit off the line, getting special armor with different properties? That'd be great, but not basic stuff such as camouflages - Missing balance of some minoritioes, as ending up captured maps by factions ( What happens is that just the game ends, pops huge-♥♥♥ thing on you to gtfo to another map or you'll die = not good, get players chance to done their game, and at least not able to be spawn again to conquered map - Minor hitbox issues ( As in any other game, attested and observed, 20-30 latency with no packet loss still gets you hit behind the corner, hitboxes and hit detection need tiny polishing)  There is nothing much to note of to this piece, i was playing PS2 just when it got released, and i have to admit it changed into VERY positive setting, and drastically ... get it! This is a game wich offers you either fun, serious fun, or hardcore, you can even choose ingame to filter groups that are for hardcore, serious fun or fun gameplay, platoons!

Get med kits, forward grips, sights, soft-point ammo (if available), or what have you. Trust me that you'll enjoy the game much more and be able to endure long enough to learn the finer points of the game.   Yes, it can be confusing. Yes, the map can be overwhelming.

Someone yelled 'Get a tank in here!' within a minute three tanks appeared. Then the skythes came....Our fighters were shot down instantly, a galaxy came in to drop off our troops and was demolished. The aliens in spandex got in a convoy of four sunderers and a tank and rode past the cliff as fast as they could. Our forces were low. We pushed through what was left of the enimes into the base. Reverse operation had occured. Now we were stuck in the base under heavy fire and the aliens in spandex were on the cliff firing down at us. 100/100 would have long amazing strategic fire fights with aliens wearing spandex again.....This actually happened but for a real review...

You can spend actual currency if you want to cut earning in-game currency or want to look nongeneric, but it is not a requirement. It offers little depth, minimal story, but that's not why you want to play Planetside 2. Ps2 is for pounding the ground either by your lonesome, with a group of friends, or in a mass of gunfire and gumption. It's a decent distraction and the lack of initial pricetag helps a lot.  My only real big issue is the netcode and how some players are able to lag around and score easy kills/ tip the battle through shoddy tech rather than any decent skill. It can be annoying but so far I have not encountered it enough to really be disuaded from playing.  Hopefully they'll release a Ps3 in the future that fixes this problem and tightens up balance a bit while maintaining faction uniqueness.",

As it stands it is a game with enormous potential, but it has deep-rooted flaws that have been neglected for years.   My thumbs down has large caveats. You can get on this game and have a great time here or there, in fact I recommend it because there are experiences in this game you just can't get from any other shooter. If you decide to play it long-term however, the issues will grow on you fast. The largest issue is a general gameplay one. Terrible base design turns most fights into shooting at spawn doors. The way spawning in general works is flawed. Taking a base requires several mobile spawns that have to be created and maintained by players, without these spawns, attackers don't stand a chance. Therefore it is the defense's objective to take out these spawns, but as a result a fun and engaging battle will be ultimately lost.  Attacking in this game is extremely punishing. Everyone loves to head to a base and defend it, you get a fun firefight that usually results in a win unless the attackers drop so many people on the base you can't even step a foot outside the spawn shield. Attacking takes a ton of effort and the game doesn't help you out any. If you want to run to the next battle, you'll die and have nowhere to spawn except back at your base a mile away. If you want to try and deploy a mobile spawn to the next base, unless you have a whole squad of back up, your mobile spawn will be destroyed before you even reach the base, or maybe last a few minutes if you make it there. After all, it is the defense's objective to destroy it. So it gets destroyed, you're back at square one at your base. By this point the other side is trying to attack your base, but you do the same to them, and on it goes.  The bottom line is the funnest engagements in this game are so rare and fleeting that most of your time spent in this game feels like frustration. You might find a good firefight, it might last for 5 minutes, then a friendly squad may redeploy from a nearby base and zerg the attackers spawn and destroy it. You no longer have targets to shoot, and you're left with the only option of trying to mount your own attack, but you know it will only end in wasted time, resources, and punch a hole in your stats.  The funnest time you will have in this game is running with a zerg platoon as they run around crushing everyone during a world event. You won't be experiencing the game at its best, but you'll get to do some fun coordinated teamwork actions while making decent experience, though most of your time will be spent idling next to objectives as the enemy is hopeless driven before the zerg.  The best thing for this game would be a competitor. Major gameplay changes need to be made, but development has been slow since the business was bought out. The future is uncertain, and I can't quite recommend spending any money on the game.",

Planetside 2 is the only place where you will find battles between hundreds of players on one giant map, not a small confined one, a full contient to traverse. Planetside 2 is the only place where you will find such weapon and playstyle vareity, from driving a tank to piloting a jet, you can do it all. There are weapons cleary designed for different engagments, from CQC to long range. Whatever your playstyle is, you will find it in Planetside 2. The lore is also very intriguing, but not very present in the game.   Here's a short version: An expidition from Earth travelled through a wormhole and became trapped on the other side. Enventually they found a planet they named Auraxis, and began settling there. But tensions were high, with the discovery of ancient alien artifacts from a long dead race known as the Vanu, the Terran Republic, or TR, banned researching the new artifacts, and began oppressing the scientists who researched the artifacts. Along with oppressing new technology, the TR began oppressing everything else, such as corporations. This didn't sit well with corporate leaders, and they formed the New Conglomerate, or NC, and succeded from the TR for opressing them. At the same time, the scientists that had previously been reseaching the Vanu artifacts, seized the technology, reversed engineered it, and declared themselves the Vanu Sovreignty, or VS.   Each faction has 'good' and 'bad' sides, so choose carefully.  The Terran Republic wants to reunite the factions, but they are a dictatorship and rule with oppression and fear. The New Conglomerate wants freedom from the TR, but it is made up of mostly mercenaries that only fight for the next paycheck from their corprate leaders. The Vanu Sovreignty believes the only way for humanity to evolve is through technology, and they kill anyone who disagrees with their views.  Each faction also has different weapon characterisics. The TR have high rate of fire weapons and somewhat large recoil. The NC have low rate of fire weapons, but they do more damage, and also have higher recoil. The VS have mid rate of fire, great accuracy, and decent recoil, along with no bullet drop for all weapons except for bolt action sniper rifles.",

Planetside 2 is a large scale warfare game where thousands of players choose between three factions, NC (New Conglemerate) VS (Vanu Soveriegnty) TR (Terran Republic) and fight on four continents, plus a small continent for new players, so techinically five. Its got great graphics, especially because of the sheer size of the game, the continents, and numer of players, its rediculous how they managed it, but its amazing.  Unlike many typicall popular FPS's of today, instead of being a run and gun game, its a tactical warfare game about capturing territory and securing victory points to conquer the continents in the name of your faction. It may include shooting as many people as you want, but at the same time, you capture points to capture bases, and then defend and attack, all over the continents, every gameplay session is new and exciting because of the masive amounts of change that can occur while you're offline. Its not for everybody, but once you get a firm idea of what to do, its extremely fun, even if you dont know what to do, getting crazy and doing stupid things can still be fun.  One of my favorite parts is definitely joining an outfit, and fighting in a functioning squad and platoon. The community is extremely friendly, with everyone looking to have fun. No salty people screaming at you over the mics. There is nothing like participating in a battle with 200 other players in a small area of the map with your sqaud leader giving directions and leading your squad or platoon to success. If you like close teamwork and territorial conquest as well as shooting as many people as you want in a never ending supply, or eeven doing whatever you want on your own without someone telling you what to do, this game is for you.

But what the only aspect I hate about this game is the optimisation. Don't get me, wrong, they have been working hard to optimising this game for ages, but I think they should do a lot more to optimise it since I basically have to put everything on low to get at least 50-60fps, even though I have a mid-ranged PC yet I barely have any graphical settings on. Overall, I would rate this game as 8.5/10.",

Yes the 100 players per battle sounds epic and the choice of gear and vehicles once unlocked looks impressive. Just have fun dieing your way through the certificates. After an abysmal preformance my greatest source of certs is the log in bonus, which puts most useful weapons and gadgets at a week or more to access. Multiply that by the 5 classes and the MAX power armor, then there are the vehicles.   As with most team games, fight and die with a team or die alone it's your choice.

Factions commonly use tactics to win battles, whether it be a decisive flank, or simply deciding to knock on the enemy's doorstep. The best part though is that there are hundreds of players shooting eachother. Unfortunately, without a friend, the game may feel somewhat boring after awhile, so it is best to hook up with a group/clan for more enjoyment, though that is my opinion. Also, leveling up and purchasing weapons truly can feel like a grind, especially if you're not willing to fork out $10 for that new rifle. While it is possible to get a new weapon without spending money, it almost feels like it simply isn't worth spending hours and hours, possibly a week or more depending on skill level to get a new weapon.",

You can literally walk away from a battle, travel for 5 minutes and come across an entirely different battle going on. Join a squad or be a lone wolf.   Not a bad learning curve at all. Again, it's like Tribes and Battlefield. If you're an FPS player, you're gtg.  On the technical side, the network code must be top notch. I've not experienced any issues connecting and playing. Graphics look great and it's not a process hog (but I'm sure the machine you're playing on will decide that for you). The menu system for your character, deploying and stats is intuitive. Everything seems to have been designed to let you jump in and play.  Negatives: none so far. Of course, if you're a COD twitch player who enjoys running around in circles shooting the same guy over and over, then this will be different for you. Not knocking COD players, I'm just more into objectives and working hard for them.  Bottom Line: It's free, it's worth hours &amp; hours of your life. If you haven't tried it yet, give it an hour and play. This might be the first Free To Play game that I drop money on.",

Offering three expansive maps, each with their own combat hotspots, the game gives you the ability to explore and look for your own ways to exploit enemy weaknesses. While this game is not strategy-based, it is not meant to be rushed into. Any kind of player that usually rushes into everything with guns blazing will likely not survive more than a few minutes at best in combat. My only true gripe about the game is that I think combat could be a little more extensive. I get that this is a Free-to-Play game, but ground fights usually depend on who can get their guns firing the fastest. However, the combat is not a huge problem, since it is still enjoyable, and the varied classes offer a decent amount of replayability.",

            "review_text": "PlanetSide 2 is one of the best F2P FPS I have ever played. The sheer scale of the battles is unmatched by any FPS known to date. However saying that, there are a few problems that I have about this game...  There are three factions, each one has different weapons, armours, vehicles etc, and there are three large worlds to control. Each world is arranged in a hexagonal pyramid layout and players must control sectors. I used to think Battlefield 3/4 had large battles, but this is just insane! Saying that, large battles often become disorganised, and during my experiences playing, I found that once your forces mount a large scale assault on an enemy fortification they will almost immediately be destroyed by waves of enemy tanks. Teamwork is the key to winning, and in my time playing I have not find anyone whos taken leadership roles. Perhaps they should add that, leaders who command units where to go, it would make up for some great strategic battles that no other FPS has.  To add to infantry, players can also spawn and use ground vehicles including tanks and of course aircraft. Ground vehicles include tanks, support trucks, buggies and quadbikes (each one has customizable weapons, skins and perks) and the aircraft are only limited to one fighter, one small transport and one larger transport. I found the driving to be very slippery and unrealistic and piloting aircraft is a challenge for new players. In all honestly, using aircraft is rather pointless in contested sectors, since there are so much god damn AA tanks and units, but if you manage to be the last aircraft in the air, and you have friends controlling the cannons you can rack up some easy kills (since the Shredder cannon on the smaller transport is OP as hell.)  But one of the things I did not enjoy was the combat. With so much people shooting, and so much action it is difficult to keep track of enemies, and when you do finally get a kill it isn't as satisfying. Plus another nuisicance was the lack of useful hit detection! I want to know where I'm getting shot, and I would love to see some blood or something covering my screen to show that I'm injured! Instead you have a healthbar, and you have to keep looking at it to keep track of your health. The combat could be improved on so many levels.  Bu even worse was the fact that there is absolutely NO leadership mechanic. In one of the battles we took part of, our team (Terran) was fighting to take back a biolab from the rebels. If you don't know what a biolab is, it's a giant dome standing on a couple of legs. They offer HUGE strategic advantage to the team that's stationed there, and in this case our team was losing badly. We were all trapped in the spawn room inside the biolab. Every single exit into the facilty was covered by at least 10 NG soldiers, and if you so much as put your shoulder out into the fire you'd probably get shot at and die. What the game needs is to add leader classes, where veteran PS2 players can give commands to their team, such as to push in this area or send the heavies and medics behind them etc... and if people follow those orders they get some sort of award such as XP or money. That way, organising assaults on enemy bases would be so much more organised and less chaotic, and when there are enemy leaders on the other side it would make for some really interesting games.

If you go into this thinking you will be a one man army you are DEAD wrong. This game is 110% abut teamwork and tactics. My recomendation FIND AND OUTFIT, this will greatly reduce the chance of you running into ridicoulous roadblocks (This game has a very steep learning curve) . Theres several rules for the factions in this game: Join Vanu= You are gay. Join The New Conglomerate = Youre a a shotgun spamming noob. Join the Terran Republic= You are the freaking king of the world and will instant achieve fame and success in both virtual and real life (Loyalty untill Death) . Rules 2 (Non faction this time) Dont run out by yourself, this is the surest way to get killed. Rule 3 Play as a medic or engineer, this is the quickest and easiet way for new players to contribute to the fight, while also having decent combat abilites (Dont play the infiltrator/sniper, nobody likes them) . Rule 4, Fly a bomber plane (that plane with 3 seats , 1 pilot 2 gunners) . Rule 5, Learn to apologize for crashing that bomber plane into your faction's mega tank colum. Rule 6 Avoid being shot by your own guys while learning to fly your plane. Rule 7, Play Smart. Rule 8 DONT FREAKING TELL ME HOW TO WRITE A REVIEW DO BETTER, I DARE YOU. Rule 9, Ask where the zerg swarm is. Rule 10 Always join the zerg swarm. Rule 11 ZERG ZERG ZERG ZERG. Rule 12 Always be in their base killing their dudes.",

First and foremost is to try and join a clan early on so you always have someone to play with as you won't be able to accomplish much by yourself. After that you'll get to enjoy tons of action as well as feel like part of a big unit out to accomplish a certain goal. The game has a ton of vehicles and different vehicles per faction. To get new weapons/attachmenets for your guns and vehicles does take a while but everything you start out with does not really put you at a disadvantage. All of the weapons are situational with the starting weapon being a very very good all around weapon so even after hours of gameplay to try to get your new weapon it still may be worse in certain situations than your starting weapon. Overall, if you enjoy FPS on a massive scale and like to feel like a grunt in a futuristic **** storm this is def a game you should check out. One downside the the frame rate issues this game tends to have even with high end PC's but I would still recommend it.  Pros :  - In game voice chat (A must for coordination and best VOIP I've expirienced in any FPS) - Massive Infantry and Vehicle Combat - Tons of Vehicles/Weapons/Classes - Persistent World ( Watch the Night Sky get lit up by bullets, rockets and lazers!!) - Mostly friendly/helpful community - SOE seem to be very involved in the community and keep you updated - SOE not affraid of hitting hackers with the banhammer - Not a Pay to Win Game  Cons:  - Bad frames still plague this game (although they claim they are working on it) - Depending on your time of play faction population may be imbalanced on certain servers - Earning Certs for weapons/attachments is time consuming - Balance issues ranging from faction to faction - Game crashes from time to time",

Communication, team strategy, opening up new flanks with mobile spawn points, a flanker class, combined arms, a map with strategic features that lives and changes, coordination in a small squad up to a platoon of 48 or several platoons, ...in short team strategy and tactics in large scale shooter!   What's more, they got the pay to play (not pay to win) model right and the development model is a thing of beauty. Here we have devs playing all over the game, in clans (or 'outfits'), broadcasting and generally dialoguing with the players all the time. Rich community. They have a roadmap where players set dev objectives. They iterate and patch nearly at the level of a League of Legends. And all in discourse with the players. Heck, there are many continents to come.  Other stuff: sniping as a real thing (not strictly CoD style twitch sniping), stealth against real human beings, vehicles (tanks, atv's, fighters, gun ships and transports), emergent story up the wazoo, whole swathes of the game that emphasies priorities other than twitch shooting (ie. leading w teamwork/objectives, hacking systems, healing, repairing, spotting...)

It is not match based. The round doesn't end when you take a territory. You have to fight to keep it. The incentive to capture territories is to get resources you can use to purchase vehicles, grenades, and other things. The controls are very similair to Battlefield, so if you have played that, you should feel at home. The graphics are also the best I've seen in a free game, but the game is very demanding. Since it is a free to play game, there are microtransactions, but the things you buy from the store are mostly cosmetic, but you can buy exp boosters and such too. Overall, the store seems pretty balanced.  The controls are tight, there are lots of players, and the progressions in this game is great.

EDIT: It's been just over a year since I first posted this review and I have say this game has evolved into something much better. Many players were intitally complaining that this game was released too early. They were both right and wrong. There was a lot wrong with it at first, but this being an MMOFPS, the community involvement was crucial in making it the much more polished game that it is today. The core game is essentially the same, but many vast improvements have been made. The most notable of which are not so obvious and are fairly recent. Those being the many software and hardware optimizations. There's finally support for more than two CPU cores and I havn't had a memory leak in many months. Having said that, this is still a brutally taxing game for most PC rigs and I can't recommend one even try it unless they can handle one of, if not, THE most demanding games currently available. However on the slim chance that one can run this game at max settings with ~60 fps, you'll experience one of the best looking and most engrossing gaming environments ever.",

Its ability to put over a thousand people fighting against each other all in the same area is absolutely ridiculous! No other MMO has been able to put itself into Planetside 2's level. It has a good amount of customization allowing players to purchase different kinds of cosmetic armor variants for each class while at the same time, allowing players to buy stronger, faster, more powerful weapons for each class. In the sense of customization, all players can play as either one of 3 factions with each faction containing each of their own variant of weapons, and vehicles. But the game doesn't only boast its war-capabilities but also its world in general. Planetside 2 contains in its world a beautiful environment. A good balance between nature, and technology.

First of is that having numbers is often all you need to win, this may not seam like a flaw but when you are outnumbered to the point that you can not hold a single location you can be forgiven for just quitting.  Second is the huge drops in frame rate that can occur during large battles making it hard anyone because by the time you fired they have already moved.  Third is the fact that it tacks a lot of grinding to be able to afford the best weapons and equipment, unless you are willing to pay for premium membership or buy things outright.  Now as the is a free to play game you have nothing to lose by playing it and if i have not detrude you by all means give PlanetSide2 a try.

This would be good, but there are numerous problems. It suffers a ridiculous amount from being pay to win and grinding for things is laughable, as the monetary amounts make Tribes items look like a walk in the park. I tried it for about 20 minutes, and all we did was hold in one position and literally run into an area and try to get 1 tiny piece of the area to actually 'win'.  Gameplay wise, its a basic FPS. There's nothing really spectacular about it that other games haven't done already or do better. The style of combat boils down to whoever can enmass the more overpowered equipment on one team at a time wins, and half the time you will spend more ingame time humping your way across the field to last about 20 seconds in the fighting area. It simply isn't a game that you can jump in and be on a decent even footing. The whole game reminds me of the Sleeper encounter from Everquest.

            "review_text": "Planetside 2 sucked until I joined an Outfit.  If you're a fan of the extremely voice-based tactical approach to warfare, like Battlefield, you can take it even further with this game. If you're willing to spend a decent amount of time playing this game, however, it is almost a waste to NOT become a member, since the amount of time spent playing otherwise will be heavily multiplied, with the many members-only double xp weekends and free station cash given to members each month to purchase the otherwise monthlong grind unlocks.  This isn't really a game to buddy up with friends and play, unless all of your friends become super dedicated and set up a schedule to play together, since usually you want to play with people who dictate commands and tactics, and when you're friends aren't around, turning to outfit members is a much more reliable choice. The few times I've enjoyed playing without outfit members were when I played with other players actively communicating ground movements and such, even though in one case we were constantly losing ground for that entire session. The massive battles and persistent world hold up to make both an original and engaging free-to-play FPS, but if you try to hop in without finding people to buddy up with (despite the fact that people are always recruiting, but low levels can definitely get shafted, and putting in around thirty hours or so will be what it takes for people to consider you a legitimate recruit for a more skilled outfit), you won't feel involved or engaged with the battles at hand, and will probably get lost trying to figure out what to do or how to navigate the plethora of menus without spending time practically studying it. One final con is that there is no real push by the developers for trying new types of engagement (no capture the flag type objectives or anything besides conquer and move on) , and oftentimes instead of finding an actual battle, you find yourself sitting in the enemy's base just watching your teammates get blasted from a one way shield spawnroom for five minutes until the timer-based conquering system registers that your forces have taken the base. On the bright side, however, this game offers a wide range of vehicles--dogfighting is awesome even if you suck at it, and the vehicle combat feels prettey balanced at this point with the infantry anti-vehicle options. This game basically feels like a co-op shooter while playing it, and it's extremely fun and rewarding if you focus on the objective and follow or give orders from an organized group. There is room for epic setpieces (but many of those require hard to unlock weapons and items/upgrades). I'd definitely reccomend this game, because time flies when I play Planetside 2 like no other.

You can fight massive battles between THREE huge empires on FOUR huge continents. Games like COD are okay for very small fights, but those fights get very boring very fast. Here there is no such thing as a small fight, a normal fight consists of around 50 people fighting for a base constantly and it does not just involve guns. There are many different vehicles that can all be customized. The best part of this game, it is free. It is also not one of those free to play games that those who spend money are automatically on top. You can play for free and you can still have a chance. I can not recommend this game enough to anyone who has a decent computer and who loves large scale warfare. The game is constantly updated with new features and SOE (Sony Online Entertainment) even has a development log on Planetside 2's website that shows what they will be adding and they even listen to input from the community. My only complaint with this game is that you need a decent computer to run it so you may have to tinker around with the graphics settings to make it work the best it can but other than that it is probably the best free to play game. I would even argue that this game is one of the best games in general, not much can compete with it.

Since the game is an MMO you can get reinforcements at any time turning the tides on the battle, your could be losing terribly but then a friendly platoon come to back you up and suddenly you pushing them back and the game doesn't just end with you capturing the base because since the game has three factions the other one can attack wall you are regrouping to push the other enemys even further then they come from behind and ambush you turning in to an all out slaughter with all the factions.  The strategic factor in the game play a bigger role then you would think (not saying you need it to have fun): if your in an outfit or 'guild' that plays the game seriously you can (speaking for experience) set up formations and other strategies you conquer the battle field so in stead of needing 2 or 3 platoons of armor and infantry you can use one platoon that squads have pacific jobs to fulfill I.e: having a scouting party to moving and hack the enemys vehicle spawners and then get to a ridge then start sniping and having tanks vanguard a troop transport to set up a spawn for you team then send the squads to capture the bases at the same time making it much harder for the enemy to stop you.  Planetside's progression systems might seem pay to win at first but you will see soon that's not the case for instance the starting weapons are not terrible like in most free fps games, I personal use the starting the weapons to this day and I have been playing since the beta. If you wanted to use new guns you don't need to play IRL money for them but it need to be said that some of the guns are pricey but none of them are 'impossible' to obtain like in other FTP games. The only things you need to pay for are camos and cosmetic stuff and how things are going you might even by the time you read this that might not be the case. The 'station cash' it self is not that expansive and I spent a good amount of money on it and other promotions and I can easily say it was worth it.   Planetside 2 is a must download game for me for some people it might not be their bread and butter but its a free game so there is no lose getting it and trying it out 9/10 game for me.",

The gameplay itself is best decribed as a mix between Battlefield 1942 and the original Tribes but on a much more massive scale. You've got hundreds of people fighting on the same continent so if you have a weaker PC, it might get choppy. The graphics are really nice. Very impressive for a free to play game. I really wish there was a way to win a game. There is no end to it, unfortunately. It's just constant battle you're trying to control points around the world for your faction. But whatever, it's free and it's fun enough. Download it.",

The polish of a completed game is wasted on incompetent or non-existent guides for what you should be trying to accomplish and how to go about doing so.  This game makes me appreciate the game design decisions in Team Fortress 2. For example, in TF2 a short video clip plays the first time you try a new game mode. It shows you the objective of the mode you are entering in order to provide you with clear directions on what you should try to accomplish.  PlanetSide 2 does not do this. Instead, you are dropped into a scenario in which you have no idea where to go, what to do, or how to get somewhere else fast. This last point is important due to the massive size of maps. Walking is impractical, so vehicles or redeploying your character becomes necessary. The player is left to figure out how to access a vehicle, how to control it, where to navigate it, and how to exit the vehicle. I honestly do not know if exiting a vehicle is allowed, just to be clear. Redeploying is done by going to a 'pause' menu, finding the map, and selecting a different zone to redeploy in. This is not explained at any point that I can remember. Where to deploy to is not mentioned either. Do I go to the front lines? It seems that I should, but why is this not made clear? And why can I go somewhere else if the front lines are the only places that I should be deploying to?  The first point I deployed to had no enemies, just a bunch of teammates wandering around. After minutes of wandering the non-descript base, I eventually found a plane to fly. I did not know where to take it, so I flew for a while until I came across what appeared to be a friendly base. I began to be pulled towards the base when I got close (I think I was pulled, maybe I just did not navigate competently). Thinking this was the game trying to 'land' my plane, I just kept cruising towards the base. I crashed, died, and respawned. Awesome time.  Team Fortess 2 has such clarity in it's objectives that I took it for granted. It is indeed possible to alienate a new player in a sea of information, menus, large spaces to traverse, and unclear gameplay elements. It is shameful that this game was released with no tutorial, and I suspect meeting a deadline had something to do with it.",

The figthing started when our squadron plummeted from the sky onto their unsuspecting air force. the combat was crazy, esspecially at night streams of bullets flew through the air as my highly outnumbers squadron fought to the death. planes were exploding left and right, but we had the upper hand when it came to fighter planes. we were cordinated well picking off warship by warship in a sycronized fashion.  Now i have never played a game that made me feel as bad @$$ as this one going into battle, wether your going in battle on foot or in a floating killing machine you still have the same satisfied feeling of having a massive numbers advantage. This game is not about individual play but it can be played solo, i do it all the time. yes there is a large learning curve but once you join a platoon they will help you find the fights pretty easy.  i would reccommend this game to anyone with a pc that can handle its specs, and yes lately the DC's have been a bit more common like once every 2 hours or so but still a amazing game; wish they had Planetside 3 out there.",

Instead of small servers with about 20-30 people, Planeside 2 has 4 HUGE SERVERS, like 500-600 people on at any given time. It is a great game, due to the fact that it is very huge and has many areas for large battles to take place in. Sadly, although there is many places capable to support huge battles, rarely do these areas actually see fighting. Most fights are skirmishes between 12-24 people to take or retake an outpost. The launch trailer shows this game as a game which is about a gruesome war. However, in game the graphics and the environment have bright colours and beautiful landscapes. All that hype of a war zone is gone. In fact, the landscape hardly shows any sign of warfare. Taking outposts is fairly boring and pointless, only allowing the next outpost to be taken. Only large outposts like Amp Stations and Bio Labs have strategic value. Adding more value to outposts and increasing the sense that the players actions have effects on the world and the war would improve the game a lot. 7/10",

            "review_text": "Planetside 2 was fun for a while, the alerts are fun and weapons are very well diverse for people to even customize them with whatever attachments they had available at the time, I have played all three sides, so I have read the chat of the three factions to see their opinions on each other. It's gotten even better since Daybreak does ban cheaters compared to the previous owner SOE. However, of my many times participating in some alerts there are some things I'd like to note for people playing this game either new or returning after a break, which would be some current events that have made it an issue to play this game.  1. The poor connection to this is pretty known to current and past players as even the devs are trying to fix this still, however that's not a real major issue compared to what I have seen.  2. Even though Daybreak bans cheaters all they do is create new accounts and get right back on and cheat again, teleporting behind players and using aimbot at point blank with a shotgun or an smg I have seen now and again. They still walk through walls at times and are reported then banned just to repeat the process all over again.  3. Then we have the outfits, there has been a major issue with every faction's outfits. There is a South Korean outfit for every faction, this wouldn't be too much of a problem if they hadn't actually flooded the Connery (American West) server, usually these outfits control these regions during an alert so I have no idea why they are not playing on their own server, all I know is that they have become far superior outfits to the others and no one really stands a chance anymore while some of us even have to wait to get into some warzones as the zone is completely full of people because of them. There are other awful outfits as they have recently done nothing but team kill other players trying to help them who are not on their outfit roster as I have been team killed by the same outfit over and over again under different circumstances. The strangest occasion being a 30 year old man strangely screaming 'Bad guy!' while I repair his vehicle as he proceeds to shoot and kill me my character says 'I fight for Vanu!' and the outfit proceeded to trash me because I was the little guy in no outfit at all since I didn't meet the 'requirements' of having a microphone. I actually had quit this game because of this very same outfit with their try hard people and some even being cheaters or just don't seem to even have any simple form of common sense.  3. The Terran Republic has a pretty bad reputation of having cheaters join their ranks while the New Conglomerate is considered to be the newbie group and is widely disrespected among the other factions except for the famous 666 Devildogs outfit being one of the very few with actual honor. (Not saying there aren't really any others with honor on different sides but not many actually punish team killing like they do unless apologies are said and people are revived.) The Vanu are considered 'overpowered' no matter what the circumstances seem to be and even have been nerfed by SOE in the past.  The game itself is fun, I loved playing it while being around the few good platoons left. But the community has become awful compared to what it used to be a couple years ago when I didn't play so much on a steam account. I have seen games change like this before and this game has become no different. It has become from a fun game with competition to a game that you will hands down lose because of the outfits being so close to each other that they'll kill any other person on the same faction but not the same outfit just for fun with no punishment other than 'locking' their guns for a period of time and not noticing that the person that they killed was the only support soldier in the local area. As I said, I had fun with this when I could, but there was no more fun to be had and I simply had to leave. People will say 'Well if you joined an outfit you'd still be playing and be having fun as this is a MMOFPS game.' Well, I didn't have enough time to join a outfit, nor did I plan to join one unless it was one of the more honorable ones for fear of being framed for being a team killer while I hate team killing all together, nor did I meet the requirements since I was waiting to buy another microphone.   Overall, I have to rate this game at a 3/10, it's not the worst free fps I've played (The worst being Blacklight: Retribution) since I love how the game works with the people being specific classes while handling jobs like piloting and I loved how teamwork used to be back then but the community once again ruined a good game. I'm sorry but I just can't recommend a game that puts a new player down so hard, or veteran players being attacked personally for the things they do in a game by children or lunatics to the point to where they switch to a similar war game searching for a better community. I honestly expect this game's American servers to be taken over by either South Korea or Russia within the next few years because they are the few outfits I actually saw who seem to just win every single time over any english speaking outfit and almost seem to always be on the Connery server. Sad to leave this game in the dust with a review that bashed it, but I used to love this game, I played a day straight getting certs for unlocking weapons and other useful things. Now it's a game where everyone doesn't trust their own team and would rather kill their own team than work with them.",

Maybe i could write down some of my more memorable moments of gameplay..  Lets start with my most cherrished memorie  it was a very dark night at The Crown, but there were few clouds to block the light of the moon. Even the stars had there role to play in illuminating the road below us. We are the Terran Republic, i was one of a number on night duty. We were tired, after a hard days fight...pinned down on both sides by our enemies. across the valley infront of us was the Vanu, and behind us over the lip of the cliff had been the New Conglomerate. And as we were about to be replaced by the next shift, the silence was shattered by a thunderous boom! it sounded as if an entire mountain had fallen..and night,lit up.. suddenly the dark sky was illuminated by tracer fire, small arms as well as plasma trails left by the Vanus Magriders there heavy tanks, wich had the farther range... in the sky above the the Vanus Magrider lines came a swath of darkness, like a great black cloud. Scythes,Liberator as well as a number of massive Galaxy Carriers, probably loaded to the gills with enemy infantry. the call went out to every availavle TR player active on the map,they started to arrive, a trickle at first but before long we had hundreds, still outnumbered. the base defenders manned the turrets, filled the air with flak. our Mech troops standing shoulder to shoulder in an attempt to blunt the threat of the incoming aircraft.Medics and Engeneers running bravely through the madness laying down ammo here and there, and as the Vanus forces in the air arrived.. so did there ground forces.brilliantly timed, Mechs, touph, well built leading the charge, Engeneers behind them repairing them, Medics repairing them, enemy snipers, cloaked in the fields watching them, all there ducks in a row. Enemy Lightnings..there light tanks, aptly named for there speed, forgo thicker armor for speed and manuverability.by this point friendly squads had been formed, dishing out jobs for the defenders. great pillars of light, beacons placed by our forces allow air dropped reinforcements. a wave of us ran into the base and formed a line at the terminal, changing our gear for the fight infront of us, a number bringing out there customized tanks, while The Crown was an easily defendable position, it lacks the size for us to man a large group of tanks, our double barreld Prowlers. our aircraft the Mosquitos, exrememly fast, able to tumble and flip behind the hands of a skilled player! i put thermal imaging on my rifle, just hoped the fight dont deterierate to the point where its needed, we need to keep them bottled on in the valley. i ran relay, bolstering our forces where needed. one moment an Engeneer dropping ammo, repairing our tanks or mechs..placeing mines and claymores at choke points, next a Sniper, picking off the occasional straggler with impunity. mostly a Heavy Weapons expert, firing homing rockets and missiles into the night. friendly Heavy Infantry with there massive heavy machine guns, litterally spit lead at our enemies. between them, our tanks and mechs, a barrage of grenades. we held our own, there forces falling before they could make much progress, but we new somehwere nearby, in the darkness was a Sunderer, a vehicle capable of acting as a mobile respawn beacon..it had to be destroyed, so those of us most proficient went out, a group a cloaked sniper. silently weaving through enemies and relaying its position to us, now its time to call in an air strike, a friendly squadron of Mosquitos, armed with hellfires, unguided, air to ground missile pods, most of them had the night vision purchased, or thermals. making locating and dispatching the Sunderer a simple task. the fight would drag for hours, one side having the advantage, then the next. by the time the sun started to rise our forces had been pushed back into The Crown, the very base we had been defending steadfast through the night.our forces were splintered, cut off from one another, desperatly fighting to protect the flag. the enemy would need to control 2 out of 3 flags to take our base.all around us you could hear weapons fire and explosions, proximity chat screaming for help, the wounded and dieing needed the medics, those still standing needed ammo from engeneers. just when we thought it couldnt get worse, the New Conglomerate attacked, they had been watching through the night waiting for there moment. and with both the Vanu and our Terran Republic exhausted, there Reavers and Vangaurd tanks, lauphably slow but more armor and firepower then 10 Lightnings, found little resitance to be had and had us routed within the hour.  do you have the strength, the iron will to serve? can you push on when all would seem lost? would you give your everything for your kin?  if so then you have found a home in PlanetSide 2, a family in us!.",

Once you start to improve, though, the game just becomes more and more fun with every kill and contribution you make to the ongoing war(s).  Another note: although impressive optimizations have been made to the game graphically since launch, you still need a pretty decent system to handle this game, and things like draw distance and detail can actually offer a tactical advantage in a large-scale environment as those in PS2.",

After that I have gotten a feel for all the new additions, and move on to other games. That being said, I always come back. Its a really fun game.  Things I like: Class defined gameplay. Some games have 'classes' so that they can divide up who gets what guns or equipment better for balancing the gameplay. Planetside seperates the classes because it makes the game easier to play. For example, some people, (like myself) really like the engineer role. We repair vehicles and Maxes, give out ammo, and provide supportive fire from our manned turrets. (those need a slight buff I think.) However, if you like to be in the fray but like the ablility to flank, light assault is for you.   Gameplay: The maps are huge. I am unsure if they are 'ARMA' big, but they feel like it. I never felt like I was in a possition that I couldn't flank the enemy if I chose to drive/fly a vehicle around far enough. Base taking is a full team effort, and you will only be able to take the objective if the number of skilled players on your team outnumbers the skilled players on the other team. However, Defendors tend to have the advantage as far as respawns and cover go, so it could go either way.   I like the new feature that locks down a continent whenever a red alert ends. Whichever faction 'owns' the continent at the end of a round gains temporary boost to their purchase stats. For example, if you want to buy a Sundee and your team owns (I think its Indar?) You get vehicle cost -15% bonous. Basically, the cost of vehicles is reduced by a percent. (Numbers and locations are not accurate.) The currency is earned by 'killing' the enemy and by capturing objectives.   What I don't like: Sometimes the game can feel pay-to-win. You will run into folks who have spend a crapton of money and can just buy all the guns, accessories and armor they want, simplily becuse they have a couple of hundred extra to spare. That is frustrating. HOWEVER. IT DOES NOT MEAN THEY WILL WIN. STRATEGY COUNTS. If you and your team work together and play the objective, you will beat a time of lone wolfs with 'big guns.'  In closing, I do reccomend this game. It's free, *You can unlock everything in game if you put enough time into it* and it has some battelfield scale that not even the Battlefield Franchise can provide. 7/10. Thanks for reading my review BTW.",

            "review_text": "ok so i played for a long time really getting into it before i decided to review and honestly this game is very good machanic wise however to give you an honest review i must say if you are looking for a personal experience were you feel like you really contributed this is not a game for you the battles are always based on numbers if you go in solo you will lose and accomplish nothing the game basically makes you takes bases and push lines but it is impossible to feel like you really acheived anything by yourself it is severly based on team combat if your team/ faction isnt working together you are doomed to fail. I will give an example of combat that is common i this game such as tank rushes, galaxy drops and airborn assualt. first off tank rushes pretty straight fwd your team basically pull as many tanks as possible and rushes the base in most cases this is super affective but also leave the solo player feeling a sense of uselessness and barly doing much of anything. Second the galaxay drop mostly used on bases that are inaccessable by ground vehicles its done by getting your team to grab a bunch of max suits which are basically to heavy mech suits with dual heavy gund such as cannons or A.A guns you load them into a couple of galaxies fly over a base and the driver ejects you wich prevents you form taking fall dmg so a bunch of you drop center of the base and take it from the inside out but again this leaves the solo player feeling unacomplished as its also heavily based on out number there base as fast as possible. Third the air assualt is done by simply getting as many air born ships and simply flying above the base droping constant bombs and shots at the gates to the spawn point preventing anyone from getting out of spawn and a few people take to capture point while this is done. Lastly i would like to mention a very negative fact spawn camping in this game is a key to winning sadly i find this very anoying cuz you are locked in a small room for a mojority of battle stuck behind a forcefield that you poke out of and shot and hopefully dont get shot instantly or blown up the second you poke your head out. This being said even with the beautiful flight machanics and combat system i have to not recommend this game as it left me feeling like i wasted my time because i was solo however if you have a lot of friends that enjoy shooters and fly this game is definatly for you just hope you are on when your faction has a lot of numbers xP",

I've been playing it for the past couple days with my brother and have to say, it's nothing short of amazing! Playing for the first time, my brother and I spawned immediately in to the action. We found ourselves pinned down with a small group of friendlies in the snowy area of the map trying to defend (what was left of) our base. Outgunned and outnumbered, my brother and I activated our stealth field generators and made a run for it to higher ground, in this situation, the higher ground was an ice glacier. Playing as the sniper class, we managed to peck off a few of the enemy foot soldiers before friendly reinforcements arrived! Quite a few tanks and gunships came in from seemingly nowhere, with guns blazing, lighting the enemy force up like the fourth of July! The victory was ours! After doing a little tea bagging on the dead enemy soldiers, we made our way to a vehicle spawner and hopped in a 3 man dune buggy. While I drove to the next objective, my brother was in the gunner's seat firing at any enemies that would cross our path.     While that was far from the beginning of the adventure me and my brother had that day, it is needless to say that this game is action packed!   The pros and cons that follow below are strictly from personal assessment and point of view, I hope they will help!   PROS  - Very large map  - Action is non stop  - Great graphics  - Good fighting mechanics  - Vehicle designs are cool  CONS  - Game mechanics make your vehicle (whatever it may be) more likely to flip  - You have to grind a lot to get a good amount of certs (free in-game money) to buy a decent weapon  - You can easily pay your way with real money to gain a slight advantage over your opponent, but at the same time everything is balanced. (I know those two sentences conflict but once/if you play the game you'll understand.)    Overall this game is fantastic for a f2p. I hope my review has helped!",

            "review_text": "If you are out for some casual fun, play this game. If your out for interesting and 'revolutionary' gameplay, look elsewhere.   now, I'm about to inform you on one of the most effective ways to kill a game.  I've been playing since closed beta, with 580 hours on record (I didn't use steam for a long while) and the game and its concepts are wonderful on paper, horrid in excution. I've acutally stopped playing in recent months because the developers have repeatedly changed what the games core concepts where about.   When I started in open beta, the game was about squad or platoon tatics. The lattice system wasn't in place so the map offered alot of tatical options for how you wanted to take on the enemy. However, this lead to a problem for the devs, because big groups of players would simply go around eachother, with only skirmishes on the edges. So they introduced the alert system. The alert system is fantastic! it allowed us to play skimish-y when we wanted and we could all gather for a mega zerg when alerts come up.   that was the best stage in the game, and I would've kept play had it been that way, but the devs decided that planet side 2 wasn't about a whole bunch of smaller battles , with bigger batles tossed in here and there. Planet side 2 was about mega zerging all the time, with small battles being a rarity. So they introduced the lattice system.   basically, the lattice system prevented you from going around an enemy force, you HAD to defeat them, which made quickly explotable tank forces nigh impossible to besige , you simply couldn't get around them. This made the game filled with mega zergs all the time.   The problem with a mega zerg is that you can't be tatical with it, you have to be tatical within it. I was part of the max clan, and we pulled in a full platoon most nights, sometimes 2 platoons on fridays, and before the lattice system, we had power. We could affect the map and make a differance for the NC. When the lattice brought mega zergs, we lost alot of our power, we didn't even make up half the population of the zerg. If we wanted to do something tatical we had to hope that our OWN faction of disorginized players in the zerg, would act in our favour. Often times we would get screwed by our own zerg, or simply be unable to make a dent in the enemy zerg because we were too small.   put aside all the balance issues with the game, but aside the map design, all the bugs and all the little nit-picky things , all those could be fixed. But what will never be fixed, is the games ability to make a community of gamers feel absoutly powerless.   50 guys all in comms, a team speak heirchy giving flawess comms within squads and within platoons.  20 guys are in the air, 6 liberators and 12 revers  20 guys in armour , 12 in tanks, 5 in harrassers and 3 supporting sundies 10 guys on on the ground, engies keeping the tanks rolling   but we need more boots on the ground to protect us from infantry, and what does the zerg of randoms do? they spawn a horde of tanks, our force can't get through, its a traffic jam, the enemy attacks, we can't return fire because were choked by friendlies , our ground force is wiped and then our air follows suite when we have no counter for the enemy AA.   50 guys made useless by the mega zerg.   thats how you kill a game.",

All guns are basically side-grades and what money you spend goes to personalization not power. You can get everything with the F2P cash called Certs. This is where it gets annoying CERTS take forever to amass, meaning that it can take up to 20hrs to get one of the more expensive weapons.  -ESF fighters: Purchasing the upgrades for ESF's with cash does NOT sidegrade them, IT JUST IMPROVES IT! its annoying. so either fly a gunship or cough up money to upgrade you fighter.  - Gunplay is fun, and every class has a purpose  -watch a couple of youtube videos, the ingame tutorial sucks.  8/10 alone, 8-9(depending on what your friends are like)/10 with friends/a squad/a outfit",

Would reccomend going for one of the older Battlefield titles for scale, or Counter-Strike for squad-sized skill match ups.  pros:  Much like Battlefield, but on a larger scale, and all for free! Real money can only be used to speed up progress and buy sidegrades. Great class variety, and all are fun in their own ways. Lots of great sights to buy. Different factions all have their own flavour that effects gameplay in interesting ways.  cons: Instant action sometimes puts you in areas that were just getting invaded by one or two guys who were just trying to backdoor/ghostcap a base. Instant action sometimes just put you back to where you already are. Redeploying to a non-reinforcement area in the map requires leap-frogging. Getting free currency (certs) is a huge grind that allows you to upgrade your classes/tanks to be flat out better than others, or to have options that were otherwise unavailable. Zerg rushes are quite common. Entire continents/zones can be locked down for quite some time. Have a favourite area? Hope that an outfit (guild) doesn't decide to cap it. No real area to properly learn how to play or improve (Koltyr for those under battlerank (level) 15?) Bases can be incredibly confusing to navigate w/o prior experience w/ previous bases on the continent.",

Hard to master  Cons: -new players will feel disheartened when it takes 40 hours or so to get a reasonable idea on how to lay the game and buy a gun -doesn't make it clear that you shouldn't buy weapons as upgrades but to speciallise -not very new player friendly(has been improved on)  Overall I would recommend putting at least 30 hours into this game before throwing it out as boring and hard. Get to know the game and I guarantee it will give you enjoyment.  ",

            "review_text": "Short version: The best and most non-p2w f2p MMOFPS around.   Extended version: A wonderful online shooter with a great progression ladder, it's definitely a shot if you don't want to spend a buck since only skins and infantry/vehicle sounds are money-only.  To add, all weapons are entirely balanced, the starter weapons are not 'better' or 'inferior' to any other weapon, only in different situations some weapons have preference (i.e. a shotgun with more range to clear larger rooms easier at the cost of rate of fire for example).  A tip for the starting player would be to search friends or an outfit (a guild/clan), since lone-wolfing will get you killed without revives all-too-often, and thus will halt your cert-gain (currency) considerably.  Here are the pros and cons of the game:  PROS: - Graphically good for MMOFPS. - Fun teamgame. - Big battles with more than 100 players on each side in an area. - The ability to upgrade your character like you want (you can choose what kind of mods on your weapon and character, for example you can take a suit which allows you to wear more grenades or ammo, a damage reduce-suit or if you feel like it, a sprint speed suit). - Different weapons on vehicles (this is much fun if you want to convert your light tank to a mobile AA and stuff, also the previous point about mods also applies to vehicles). - &gt; BALANCED WEAPONS! &lt; (the struggle of 95% of MMOFPS's)  CONS: - Need a decent rig to get 60fps on full graphics with more than 30 people and some explosions around. - By decent in the previous point I mean very-decent, a 700 bucks self-sorted PC with new gen game graphics (like the Nvidia GTX *50 (* meaning 5 to 10) and up to *70) might still have 40 FPS or lower in certain situations. - Hard to lone-wolf. - Learning curve if never played big battle games like this or Red Orchestra etc.  SCORE: 8.5/10 Never seen such a well-balanced f2p game before. These devs are doing it RIGHT for a change.",

NOT pay to play.. it's more like customisation. You can buy the upgrades.. or sidegrades as well.

The world is HUGE. 3 continents with dozens of bases on each.. all very different. There is ALWAYS a battle going on somewhere. Though i dont think its nearly as busy as in its hayday. A very good player playing the physically weakest class can annihilate a newbie/bad player with the most armored/heavily armed class Aircraft are badass. Easy to fly.. hard to fly CORRECTLY (ie not die) Vehicles can dominate a battle.. or sit around completely useless/get slaughtered  Factions: there are differences between factions. I play nc (slow HARD hitting guns that kick like a mule) The differences arent that huge. NC imho isnt the faction to pick for infiltrator.  Try it . It's free. Put a couple hours in and you'll either like it or love it. You wont hate it. Expect to die a LOT. And quite a bit through things you cant control.

The main goal is to get a HIVE in your base to generate victory points for your faction to win the battle over a map.  (There are many ways to do this, the HIVEs are only one part.) But a base without a HIVE is of use too, as its turrets provide additional firepower and the fortifications help slowing down the enemy advance, while providing cover for players.  The only downside I can think of, is the need to unlock a few expensive things, like the turrets, with certs (ingame experience currency) - but it's not a grindy game and if you played it for some time, you have enough certs anyway.  Btw, most (new) bugs have been fixed and the game runs smoother than ever.   PS2 is a game I gladly return to, if other shooters start to bore me and it never fails to absorb me for a few weeks more.  *** Planetside 2 is the best FPS-MMO there is. Massive scale battles with inf and ground+air vehicles, that no other game can offer, combined with persistend maps to conquer and defend.  Of cause there are a lot of minor things to complain about, but that's not what I want to do here, because PS2 improved a lot over the time I played it and it's still a lot of fun.  And the best is - it's free and absolutely not pay2win. It has the best F2P-model I have ever seen. You have to try it.

Its nothing like say wow or destiany where a experienced player or someone who buys lots of things is so much better than a noob because of weapons that are insanly more powerfull, all power in the game is ultimatly skill and tatics. Nothing about the game is liniar squad matches, it is a continental sci-fi war simulator.

            "review_text": "* This review may be biased due to my history with the game. I will be updating this review when new things pop up.  My Experience with Planetside 2: I have played Planetside 2 a year after the Beta when it was still under Sony Online Entertainment (SOE). I have BR47+ characters in Briggs, Australia. Ever since there was little to no updates after the new continent 'Hossin' was released, I quitted like how some Veterans quit a game if it didn't meet their expectation. Now that the new Construction Update and Performance Tweaks have been placed into the game after the switch of management to Daybreak Games, I am thoroughly enjoying Planetside 2 again. Some of my old clan mates are gone but that is to be expected  Update and Game Status: - Lots of new content - Healthy number of players all day long (Briggs, Australia)  Why Planetside 2 is fun: - Dynamic Gameplay elements make it such that experiences are very varied (Can be a negative. Will explain later) - Its Free - Great Community (When played in platoons/outfits)  Why Planetside 2 is NOT fun: - Zerging and Spawn Camping. When dynamic elements are captured and seized by the enemy, most solo players will either ignore or contest the area (usually without help). This results in mindless zombies walking around - No friends? This will probably result in you not having fun - Friends with no experience? You're probably both going to get wrecked and do a deservice to the game  What to do when jumping into Planetside 2: - Find a INTERACTIVE platoon or a outfit (Outfits=Clans). The game is not all that fun playing solo - DO NOT GET TILTED. Having a low k/d is fine in PS2 so long you help out others. Playing support in Planetside 2 can play a key role in victories - READ UP AND WATCH VIDEOS. I can't stress this enough. Without prior knowledge of EVERY game mechanic, you'd be jumping in to a hell fire zone - Expect Zerging. PS2 still has a 'More people=victory' meta. Make sure you don't get demotivated from it and just spawn to another zone to fight in",

Catch some of that to get a better handle on the game because there really aren't good resources in-game for learning.  I have close to a thousand hours in this thing, some with a membership, some without... not a huge difference there, more at the end of the review.  &lt;Review 6/26/2016, because it changes&gt; ---Use VR training on the item BEFORE you buy it, use attachments too, and then trial it if you can in-game... make good money decisions, don't be me---  1. Daybreak, and before them SOE, took on an epic task to mainian balance without wrecking a massive game. Don't kid yourself, this isn't easy.  Every faction has (some) good starting weapons, the Heavy's LMGs are VERY different, but all surpisingly balanced, if you use the right tactic, and I will cover paying in on 'What to Buy and what to grind' (point 3)   2. In the ever present struggle to introduce new content, make the game balance out, maintain parity between factions, and actually make money (they have to do that too), they have lost sight a bit on the vehicle aspect of things (currently, and for quite a few months). It's currently a bit too easy to wreck air vehicles, in some situations Tanks are too easy to wreck with infantry as well.   Also, expect salt from old players. Some old strategies &lt;some of them exploits&gt; just don't work anymore and not everyone wants to learn new ways to play.  3. IMPORTANT! Buy the NS-PDW....I got mine in black(NS-PDW-B), it looks better, you can also earn it (normal, no colors to it), for ONE character at a time, this is why you BUY it with real money. If you buy NOTHING else, buy this weapon. You may shift faction, or want to play as more than one. This will help with that.  Get a camo for yourself if you don't get it black, (Walll Hugger is closest and most useful, also cross-faction, can only be bought) it will work for you and your guns as well, save some money and be harder to see in facilities.    3.1 NEVER buy anything that is NOT an NS weapon, cross faction camo, or cross-faction decorative gear with REAL money. (well, you could, but NS is a better deal)  BUY BUNDLES of NS weapons if you can and don't want special colors. Better deal, wish I had... Here is why. NS weapons unlock for every character you will EVER have with that account. If it's not attached to a tank, fighter, or related to the construction system, an NS weapon or cross-faction gear will unlock for every character.  You can still get them with certs, and if you are good, ddo that, BUT, you need to be unlockingg things that you CAN'T buy. You have to EARN your infantry armor, get it first.  4. Things to earn RIGHT AWAY (you CAN'T buy these, they change the game). Grinding gear, like  a. maxing out engineer repair tools, b. maxing out medic gear and ailites, c. upgrading (but not maxing) infitrator recon darts d. maxing out explosives proxies, tankmines, and sunderers (essential vehicle)   Absolute must ASAP after grinding a bit, or other cert gains?  a. Maximum nanoweave armor for infantry.  b. Deployable explosives. This should be an early earn, and should be upgraded based on playstyle. Engineer, this is a must, 3 tank mines in the right place makes for a spectacular credit gain, including a group kill, killstreak, and other bonuses on top of everyone you kill in the vehicle. It''s also fun, and delays reinforcements to your location. The explosives 'dwell' they stay until they blow up, are disabled, or you log off. They will change the game for you. Don't be shy aboout crowing to your squad when it happens. A good squad will recognize how much you just helped.  Membership It helps with resources and cert gains. It's not really pay to win, exept that you get a 50% boost to vehicle pulls. I would say that if you are bad with vehicles or go through alot off infantry resources (mines, C4, grenades, medkits...), that becomes a pay-to-not-suck.  If you are a decent driver and careful, you shoudn't need to pull a vehicle every 3 minutes, so  That's a bit of a guide and a review. Follow at least some of this and the game will be a bit more fun.",

            "review_text": "OVERALL: Strong 8/10. Highly recommended. Worth a try at least sense it's free. =================================================================  Prior to the recent updates to refresh the game PlanetSide 2 was becoming increasing boring, repetative and it was difficult to play because anyone that wasn't a veteran player was basically just farming crops for the veterans. 'Veterans' as in those that have played the game long enough to know every little detail and advantage.  However the new updates have changed that with all sorts of new changes, from character, world and the new construction changes. Not going to give you a change log of the updates, so if you want further info on it just look on the official sites or forums.  Anyways, now the game is once again pretty fun again. Pretty much everything is properly balanced now and it's all fair. No more just being farm crops for the veterans. Items are still way over priced though, both with in-game credits and actual money - it's pretty ridiculous.  Experiences may vary. Don't go into this game expecting to have a K/D of 5.00 or something (competative outfits typically only have a minimum K/D of 0.5 so that kind of gives you an idea.) In this game you're nothing but a number, fighting along side squads, platoons and outfits is the only way to victory. You can go solo, but it's more for snipers and guerilla tactics. Outside of that you won't get too far solo. For new players this game is going to be extremely intimidating and you're going to die over and over again. Just find your playstyle and stick with it and soon you'll become a proper player. On average it probably takes a good week or two before you get comfortable. If you can rough it through that long you're in for a treat as this game is like none-other. Massive scale conflicts, teamwork, leadership, any vehicle you desire, passive playstyles or agressive. There's something here for everyone and everything contributes to victory. Unless you sit idle in a spawn room.  Factions really don't matter, A LOT of players join the faction which they most believe in rather than what they offer. Which is pretty awesome. A quick summary of the factions.  TR: Rapid fire, large clips, moderately in between good armor and agility, usually medium to long range.  NC: Slower fire (and tanks,) smaller clips, better damage and damage resistance, close ranged.  VS: No recoil (basically the CoD faction,) very agile and fast.  In the end though it's all balanced so it doesn't matter what side you choose. You may cry OP! But if you were on the other side you'd probably cry OP! As well. It's more about playing smart with teams than solo run and gun like in BF/CoD/most other shooters.",

Getting points to upgrade your classes and purchase weapons is one thing, but I feel like the thing that's the most difficult in terms of adjusting was how the game does matchmaking.. This is where the game seems to be the most broken.. If you join a bad match where your team is outnumbered, most people will leave that area leaving you to fend for yourself or just leave as well.

The menu is very neat and you can easily identify things. All soldier classes are already unlocked, so you don't need to save certs (the currency of the game) to buy it. The vehicles and soldiers are highly cuztomizable to fit your needs. The graphics is very amazing for a free-to-play game. Also, I think it is pay-to-win, BUT it doesen't matter that much because you are able to easily counter your enemies. Even though you are just going to start playing it today, you will still enjoy it and there are still several players here.",

Planetside's variety of combat roles allows players to experience multiple different aspects of combat from small scale skirmishes or sneaky flanking maneurvers up to massive 100 vs 100 soldier fights or large armor colums facing off each other in a persistant open world. Aside from your infantry classes, there are multiple combat vehicles and player base constructs that can be used. In one game session you can go from sniping, then flying in a jet plane, to building a base as a road block, switch to light assault to use your jet pack, and then bring a tank to destroy the enemy.",

            "review_text": "My PC isn't good enough to handle major fights on the main continents, so the current hours I've clocked were from the newbie zone. Being a small, six-zone island you'd be surprised to clock in a full day of playtime but Planetside 2 can be pretty addictive. This game is fun, hands down. You will also die a lot. Don't get frustrated, take your deaths as a learning experience and continue playing. Working with a team will help you out big time, as everyone working on the objectives together will succeed.  I feel the reason I like this game is it tops Battlefield in the sense that there is a limit to how many people can be in a server at one time on Battlefield. With Planetside 2 there is only one lobby (four if you count servers as lobbies, I don't) and if there is a limit, it's much higher than Battlefield's. When I do manage to get into a big fight it's glorious, like a real war with far more troops than 32 on either side.  Combat and gameplay tactics are taken a step further with three factions fighting each other instead of just two. This means that it isn't just a simple attack and defense between two teams, while you're going after one faction the other could be just as easily taking your bases on the other side of the map.  ----- I'll be upgrading my PC over the holidays so I can experience more content of Planetside that I haven't already. If I feel the need to update or continue this review I will, I know I missed some big points like guns, vehicles and outfits/squads, but as I said that's content I still need to fully experience. Happy gaming and I hope to see you guys in-game!",

The Map was huge and everything was full of Symbols. Luckily i joined an Outfit so they could show me the way around. I won't try to explain the mechanics of this complex game in the review, but the core is to Capture Territory in huge Battles for your Faction (Terran Republic, New Conglomerate or Vanu Souvereignity) to lock one of the Four Continents (Indar, Esamir, Amerish, Hossin). Just Note that this War never ends: If you lock a Continent, another Continent will get unlocked again. The game will be very Confusing when you first start playing it, this is why i suggest new Players to join an Outfit. Just a side Note: Don't join the Outfit with the most Players but rather search for a mid sized Outfit (~200 Players). Jump on their Teamspeak and they will be happy to help you out and show you how the game is played! And my last tip to survive the first few hour of playing:  Prepare to die. Alot.  After that you will get hooked to the game, since there simply is no game around like this.",

There are always atleast 1000 people on a server (if the server says the population is low, that means that there are atleast 1000 people). Of course, there are the drawbacks. First, you need to have a good computer to play on medium graphics, let alone max graphics. Also, upgrades to take a bit to get (keep in mind, this is not a 'pay to win game). Overall, this game is epic, and its worth a try.",
