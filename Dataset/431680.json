            "review_text": "Extremely overpriced for what you get (I'd pay now less than 1$, 2$ and I'm being generous enough). Also note that this game it's intended better for a dumb cellular than for a decent PC. Any decent PC could be used to do much more than this 'piece' of software. It's extremely simple, basic or call it like you want. Got almost all achievements in less than 24 hours, but in this lapse of time:  - I had breakfast - I Worked a little (not too much) - I had lunch - My wife got to walk our two dogs (and me) - We talked with friends while drinking a coffeee - I had dinner - I wrote some posts in Steam - And had time to do some things more  Simplifying... It is simpler than fry an egg  I forgot to mention... replayability none, null, zero  End of transmission...",
