            "review_text": "  Phantom Brave is a fantastic if very unique SRPG.   Based on the Wii version of Phantom Brave, but having all of the extra content of the PSP version, Phantom Brave PC is about a girl named Marona whose family was killed by a monster several years ago, with the exception of her brother, whose magical abilities allowed him to live in a state between life and death as a phantom. Now living alone with her brother, she is shunned by the outside world. Because of her brother, many assume she is posessed and want nothing to do with her. So she sets out to do work as a chroma helping people, hoping that someday people may appreciate her. Its a really heartwarming video game; the relationship between Chroma and her brother is endearing, and you can really tell he cares about her and will do whatever he can to keep her safe. The isolation that Marona feels is constantly heartbreaking, and you can feel the pain and struggle she goes through to be viewed and treated properly. In this lies one of Phantom Brave's strengths; unlike its Disgaea predecessor, the game is much more serious and down-to-earth. The characters are realistic and believable, so the game can really scratch at your heart.  Gameplay wise, unlike traditional SRPGs, this game is not grid-based. Instead, you can freely move across the map, having only a set amount of distance you can travel per turn as your limit for movement. Added to this, with the exception of the main character, Marona, you can only have your units on the battlefield for a few turns before they can no longer be used again. As a result, the player must struggle to best determine when and where to summon a unit, for it may be a waste to try and move a unit all the way across the battlefield to strike at an enemy. In this, I find that the game is a bit more strategic than other SRPGs; you can't rely on every unit at once, as doing so would waste your characters. You can't summon characters just anywhere on the battlefield. Every character summoned must be somewhere near Marona. Because of this, you also need to carefully protect Marona, because if she dies, the number of turns you have is limited to how long the remaining units on the battlefield have before they vanish for the rest of the battle. The game is challenging and rewarding. That's not to say that the gameplay is perfect though. The mouse and keyboard controls are a tad clunky. They're servicable to be sure, but ideally I would recommend playing this game with a controller. The game is also somewhat grindy. Its not TOO bad about this, especially if you know how to properly utilize the fusionist character, a unit you can create on the main hub world before going to a new level. With the fusionist you can combine weapons and characters to make better weapons and characters, but if you don't properly utilize this you'll be stuck replaying a few levels a few times over. The fusionist is a bit confusing to get the hang of, and replaying missions you already beat can get dull after a while. But its important to have a strong and sizable team, so you must do these things. Without a sizable party, you may run out of characters to summon too early, thus leaving you stuck with Marona to fight, which may not be ideal depending on how you've strengthened her.  Disregarding all that, the music of this game is really beautiful and relaxing, utilizing a violin as the main instrument. The main menu theme, Angel Breath, is relaxing and comforting, befitting the more down-to-earth tone of this game. Then boss battle tracks like Game Breaker and Strange Wind offer a much faster pace for fights to make things a bit more exciting, however they continue to utilize an instrumentation that sounds almost like something you'd expect to hear out of classical music, though with a few more modern instruments. Game Breaker in particular makes good use of the acoustic guitar for its main melody. All in all, the music is really great, and a huge step up from Disgaea 1 in my opinion.  All in all, the game is great and I definitely recommend giving it a try!  Also, if you're worried about the game port: Don't be! Unlike Disgaea PC, this port is much cleaner and almost entirely devoid of bugs, complete with more menu options than its predecessor. The backgrounds are straight up HD even!",

            "review_text": "I put thousands of hours into the PS2 version of this game, so obviously I have quite a bit of experience with the game. There's already a lot of reviews talking about the gameplay and how great the port is, so I'm just going to tell you how great the keyboard/mouse support is.   Initially I was playing with the steam controller, but decided to see what the keyboard/mouse played like. It blows my mind how easy it is to do everything in this game with the mouse. Movement is controlled via WASD like any FPS, or top down game where you move the map/character, and you can control almost every other aspect with just the mouse. The only thing that is kind of awkward is that Jump is assigned to L, but you really only need to use that while you're wandering around the island, so not very important at all.   If you are a fan of Disgaea, or played Phantom Brave on the PS2 I would highly reccomend picking it up on Steam.",

Its simular to the Disgaea game but has some of its own battle mechanics that are rather unique!   The story so far I am liking and though I do like the unique battle mechanics I will say only flaw so far is it is a little more difficult to use compared to disgaea. Mostly when it comes to targeting the enemy. But once I got use to it, it became a little easier! Just needed to give it a chance.",

            "review_text": "Despite many hours played, i've mostly completed main story + side story and grinded a bit, slow player here. Phantom Brave is one of the many gems that Nippon Ichi brought to life. If you've played Disgaea you might have seen Marona and Ash cameos\\DLCs. Story: Don't come in expecting the typical Disgaea's story style, it goes a bit more serious and 'dramatic' while keeping many strong generic characters that you'll see for the entire game. I still recommend it because it's a good change of air from your usual comedy like Nippon Ichi games.  Gameplay: Much like Disgaea but having some unique elements such as free movement, picking up items\\weapons scattered around maps, the main heroine's ability: Confine spawning her phantoms in objects (as well having their stats affected) and having a limited about of turns for your phantoms to persist and even corpses that you defeat or get defeated. You better get used to 50 population in your main hub island, it takes a bit of time and patience.  Music has always been a strong component in Nippon Ichi games and it never fails.  Overall it's a good game, haven't got any trouble running, steady 60 fps, not a single crash and can turn off some settings.",
