I recommend playing this with friends and hang out in Teamspeak, this makes the game way more interesting ^^)   EDIT(08/20):  After the recent patch, the game currently struggles with even more bugs. Annoying bugs. Beside of buggy matchmaking, you even lose 3 rank-pips for just restarting the game and not playing. I really hope for a fix, since this makes the whole rank-system completely useless.  They fixed the bug, but I got no 'refund' of my lost pips.  08/28 : This is probably my last edit for this review. I need to say, the devs did a great job so far. After struggling with the latest patch, they fixed around 95% of annoying bugs and balanced the game just right. I like the state the game has right now &amp; I'm excited for upcoming stuff.  ♣♣♣ I know, everyone has a bad day sometimes, but you shouldn't put it on the games 'balance' or calling the opponent side OP. Instead, try to work on your own mistakes. Playing both survivor and killer actively, I can tell you, if you have a decent gameplay &amp; map knowledge, you will ALWAYS get atleast to the 'black pip'. The only exceptions would be if our friend billy charges directly in your face and then decides to camp after hanging you or the killer is lagging very hard. ~  oi, if you made it to this point, thanks for reading my 'brief' review ╰(*´︶`*)╯♡",

DBD is obviously rushed and still imbalanced with all the loads of bugs plus the game's non existent party system which complicate the game itself. Infinite and crappy loading screens, errors in joining the lobby, getting stuck glitches in map, with more cons in its pros and cons. I do hope the devs would work on the game ASAP. The game has so much potential.IF YOU DON'T WANT TO GET DISAPPOINTED, DON'T BUY THIS UNTIL HUGE IMPROVEMENTS ARE DONE.JUST WAIT TIL THIS GAME IS PERFECTLY POLISHED.  but still 8.5/10 :)",

I was really on the fence about this purchase because I thought that this concept would get old fast, but I'm 23 hours in over the course of around 4 days and I'm still excited to keep playing.  First of all, this game would probably be best described as 'tense' instead of 'scary.' I suppose this could vary from person to person, but considering my background of absolutely zero appreciation for horror movies and games, most people will not find this game scary.  The store page and countless twitch streamers will give you a great idea of the gameplay, so I won't explain how the game works, but I'll just list a couple issues/aspects that could turn people off from the game.  -No communication with survivors while in a match (Personally I think this is kind of cool.) -Some achievements are not working properly -A few bugs, such as survivors getting 'glitched' and not being able to pick them up as the killer or heal them as a survivor -No actual matchmaking.  -Killers host the server, so a laggy killer will make you lag as survivor. (However, you can test your connection to the killer in lobby by typing a message and observing the delay before it appears in chat.)  I don't believe the developers have plans to add communication, but I am almost certain that the other issues will be fixed shortly. There have been numerous updates to fix bugs and add content.   This game is extremely fun to play and I can't recommend it enough. The only thing that has really affected me is not being able to play with friends online (edit: you can now survive with friends).  Edit: Removed issues that were fixed   TL;DR: Awesome gameplay with a few issues that shouldn't ruin an experience.",

I love how the developers wanted to capture the essence of human error in the game with both surviving and hunting. As of right now you can play with friends in a private lobby, and not recieve experience, but the devs. have said they are going to add a party system where you and friends can play together in public matches. They just didn't want it on release, and now I am not entirely sure why they would do this, but I am assuming it is because they don't want a premade team of survivors playing against a new killer and then winning by a landslide. They may also want to get the community more willing to talk and communicate with randoms, who knows. So for those who have decided that you will never get this game if you can't play with friends you WILL be able to, just...not right now.",

If you're looking for the kind of game that never needs improvements, balance changes, bug fixes, add-ons, etc, than first of all: where do I find such a game? Second: this game is probably not for you.  Dead by Daylight is an amazing experience. It's a game that does a lot of things that you don't see much at all right now. The game has some problems, (some worse than others) but if you are a somewhat patient person, and enjoy unique experiences, this is a great place to look.  There are lots of good people who are loyal to this game. Dead by Daylight is really something special in terms of community, and content. Like the fact that there's already two new 'Chapters' out, and they're great additions to the game too. It's really an exciting thing to try and guess what's next. There are tons of people with public ideas on possible killers, maps, etc.  The game can be very difficult to start out, however, I enjoyed it from the start, and I was already expecting a lot out of it. And I'd like to add a little bit of (very important) detail to something that many players point out in both positive and negitive reviews. That is, the difficulty. Sure it can be really hard as a new player. But it isn't so much because it takes a very long time to level up - which it does - but instead it is simply that you have to learn the way it works. That's all. I even sometimes play as one of the survivors that I still have at level one, just to experience the thrill of having no perks, items, etc. It is however very difficult to do this with a killer. Being a low level killer, kind of sucks sometimes, but that gets better too as the game grows.  I think this game deserves really great reviews. This is my only review I've written, and I usually don't really do things like this, but I really want to see this game turn around!  In case you're still reading this, I play as both killer and survivor, and thank you for reading!",

Alright, 373 hours in, I'm going to back up my own review. Still love this game ^^  ORIGINAL REVIEW: Absolutely love this game, I'm now over 200 hours in and it still doesn't get boring as no two games are the same, also there is a big diversity of areas and maps and there will be even more in the future. I recommend it to anyone that likes the horror genre and the Survivors-get-chased-by-a-Killer theme.  P.S. Don't get discouraged by all the negative reviews. 85% of them are by people with very low gameplay time. This game takes several hours to 'git gud' as you need to learn how to play against each of the four Killers and counter each of their specific abilities and unique play styles. Practice really makes perfect in this game.",

Learn from mistakes, make new tactics and even fave fun in a horror game are here in this game.

            "review_text": "UPDATED REVIEW The game is a 4v1 survival/hunting game. Basically you can be The Killer or The Survivors. There are 5 different killers with 5 different ways to play them. Trapper - traps, Hillbilly - instantly incaps, Wraith - cloaks, ♥♥♥♥ - I mean Nurse - teleports, and Shape - stalks/instatly incaps. The goal is to sacrifice or kill all the survivors before they can escape. As for the Survivors. There 6 different survivors with 6 different characteristics. There is Dwight - supports/boosts, Claudette - supports/healer, Meg - agility/adredaline, Jake - sabotage/calm, Nea -stealth/agility, and Laurie - spotter/baiter. There goal is to activate the remaining generators to open the escape gate. They also have to rely on teamwork. And hide from the killer. In my previous review I said how there was no teamchat. Well they added a chat in lobby and after the game ends. So you can do some preplanning with teammates. Otherwise use Teamspeak or something. I also complained about servers. They have improved them working a lot better. (9/10) ORINGIAL REVIEW The game play is great. Extremely fun and intense at moments. Though there is no team chat which results in a lack of teamwork. Sadly I find myself carrying the game. Another side note to consider is that the servers are absolute crap. Half the time the servers disconnected or steam just goes down. Really kills the fun. I'd give it a 6/10 until some changes are made. Please release an update soon.",

The atmosphere when you're the killer is amazing and also the nice feature of your heart beating when the killer is near is an awesome niche to the game.  Now quite a bit of people are complaining that there's no party system or chat system but if you think about it, the DEVs would've thought of implementing a party system just like every other game but they didn't put it in it for one factor, being fairness.   The first reasoning for the no party system is because it would be extremely one sided for the Survivors to win.   To reinforce my first reasoning of the party system is because of communication. Because the survivors aren't able to use their mics or type in-game, they aren’t able to know where their teammates are to go distract the killer, heal their teammates or work on the generators. In saying that, this would give the killer fair fighting chance to win. For example, when playing by myself in the beta I would usually lose half of the matches I've played. However when I was playing with my mates while communicating via skype to which we pretty much won every match.  Yes it would be better to have a party system because it’s quite annoying putting up with people leaving and re-joining to join their friends but hey, when life gives you lemons, make lemonade and don't be a little ♥♥♥♥♥ about it.",

            "review_text": "If you like classic slasher movies and that kind of stuff I am sure you will enjoy this one.   Dead by Daylight is really interesting game. Asymmetrical multiplayer in its core is really similar to Evolve. There is one killer and 4 survivors. Killer wants to slaughter these horny teenagers and survivors just try to escape. There is no way to kill the Killer so as a survivor you need to hide and work together to survive. Also it provides the horror element to this game making you feel helpless. This game provides 2 different gameplay experiences which are both equally enjoyable. It offers variety even if the gamemode is always the same.   When you see people who have written reviews of this game, you can see that quite many have several hundred hours of playtime. That is because this game is addictive. There is not many maps to discover or interesting stories to find but what makes this game addictive is competition. I place this game in to the category of 'Skill addiction'. Much like many mobas and competetive shooters, this game has a steep learning curve and a ranking system. Getting better and unlocking new perks for your characters keeps you 'hooked' and the gameplay experience fresh even when there is little variation.   If you can look past some rough edges, bugs and salty adversaries, you will find very compelling and addictive multiplayer experience.   8,5/10",

If there was probably one thing that bothered me, It'd had have to be one of the killers called the Wraith.  The Wraith can go invisible with the bell item and either wait/hunt down the survivors, (the bell does not have a time limit). Invisibility's a pretty op kinda thing and almost sort of unbalances the odds a little, The bell or the movement speed of the Wraith should be tinkered/nerfed to balance it up a little more.",

            "review_text": "19, July, 2016 Dead by Daylight is a multiplayer, competitive, survival, horror game which typically is played as a 1v4, 1v3, 1v2 or 1v1.  The setting is in some sort of abandoned park, or field, etc (different maps) at night where 1-4 survivors are trapped and must attempt to escape. The reason why they must escape is because lurking in the area with them is a demonic, cold-blooded serial-killer. The killer who is controlled by 1 player in the match must kill/sacrifice as many survivors as possible. Sounds like a pretty straight-forward matchup. However it is not as easy as it seems.  In each map there are 2 main exits which are closed and dysfunctional, as well as around 7 stationary generators spread around the area. In order the power the main exists, the survivors must repair a certain number generators (typically depending on the amount of survivors in the match (4 survivors = 5 generators. 3 survivors = 4 generators. etc)) Each generator takes a vaguely large amount of time to repair and while survivors are repairing them they are constantly under the heart-pounding pressure of encountering the killer.  The killer's job isn't entirely simple either. When the killer finds a survivor he must strike them (generally twice) with their primary weapon in order to seize them from running and down them. From there the killer cannot physically kill the survivors (unless a certain 'perk' is used). His job is to pick them up and hang them on sacrificial hooks spread around the map. The hooks keep the survivors stationary and sets a long time limit where a spider-like, speared creature (best description I can give) forms around the hook post and attempts to kill the survivor. The survivors can be saved while hung up though.   At this point in time (July 19, 2016) the killer player can select 1 of 3 different killers, each with a different ability. One carries around beartraps which can be set anywhere and seize wandering survivors. One has a cloaking bell which can turn the killer mostly invisible. And also one with a chainsaw that can be used to charge at and completely down any survivors that make contact.  The game as well as being challenging includes many more mechanics and features than it appears. When performing tasks such as repairing generators or healing teammates, the game randomly displays 'skill checks' in order the make the tasks more pressuring and challenging. Upon failing a skill check, the completion bar will move down slightly and will also causes a very audible sound, potentially attracting the killer. Upon succeeding a skill check, the bar moves skips a few seconds and rewards the player extra game points. There are also storage crates around the map which contain useful items for survivors such as medkits for assisting in healing other survivors or yourself, toolboxes for assisting in repairing generators or sabotaging hooks and other mechanical objects, or a flashlight which can be used to blind and stun the killer when necessary.  There are many ways for survivors to counter the killer's wrath including vaulting over slightly raised objects or windows, pushing down barricades in front of him and potentially stunning them, blinding them with the flashlight, hiding in cabinets, or planting themselves in camouflaged positions in order the lure the killer away.  There are many other mechanics in-game which I would love to talk about but need to keep this review not as long. The game also has a ranking system used to truly compete with other players and become more skilled at the game. There are also a variety of customization options, items, perks and add-ons for the characters and killers.  The game at this point in time isn't perfect, as there are many bugs and in-game features which make the game less fun and more frustrating at times. However, what we have right now is a creative, fun and interactive competitive game that tests and rewards the player's ability to remain vigilant, keep focused, be stealthy, stay alert, and be altruistic and supportive to your fellow survivors. And always remember that 'death is not an escape'  Pros: - Incredible variety of mechanics - Intriguing gameplay - Audio gives players paranoia - Overwhelmingly terrifying moments - Greatly tests player's gameplay abilities - Variety of customization and add-ons - Enjoyable when played with friends - Potential epic and satisfying moments  Cons: - Some frustrating mechanics and features - Confusing ranking system - Non reusable items and perks - Over-powered favouring to quickly skilled players - Glitches (July 19, 2016) - Not a lot the game has to offer (July 19, 2016) - Poorly optimized (July 19, 2016)  7/10 Recommended for players interested in multiplayer, survival horror, strategy, and competitive gameplay.",

Obviously the course of the game doesn't change that much but still every round is a bit different and it never gets old for me if the killer passes by without noticing me crouching in high grass. As far as I can tell the waiting time to get into a lobby has been successfully reduced by a large amount and for the last few times I played I never had trouble with getting kicked out of a lobby. The biggest problem for me is still that killers camp and then the other survivors don't want to come near the hook - perfectly understandable but that really makes the game short for me.  All in all I really like this game and if you're not too keen on getting ranks and levelling like mad it can be great fun.  ",

It would be cool if DEVs add a mic option where we can actually talk like 'whisper' in the gameplay so it adds the surreal of the environment that we are in or something.

            "review_text": "This game is really fun to play. The devs have been working hard on getting it playable and enjoyable. At the beginning I'd say the matchmaking was a HUGE fail. Waiting more than 15mins to join a lobby is nuts, this is especially if you are with more than 2 friends. It still happens but not as much when I first started playing. If you see anyone with tons of hours played, cut it in half cause half of it is waiting.   Now, playing survivor/killer is another story because you can pop into games within minutes. Although, I haven't gotten my character leveled up enough to get high perks, I do enjoy what I use that I have unlocked. The maps are great and creepy, and so are the killers. The nurse is pretty hard to escape from but doable and enjoyable when you do survive.  I have to say that the most negative part right now is the new DLC. Most lobbies you join has the new killer (Michael) and he gets everything in his favor, and being a survivor that sucks because it's rare that you can survive. The killer barely has a heartbeat and can follow you no matter what you do to get away. He also has a bunch of combined perks that can make you go down in one hit or die instantly. They definitely should have worked out the kinks before making it a purchasable DLC. (I understand that it's due to liscensing because of the franchise of 'Halloween' movies.) The matchmaking is once again an issue here, I've played a game that we're all rank 18's against a rank 5, the lower rank you go the better perks you have and the better you are. It should be everyone in the same rank here to play against each other. Rather than having insta-death at the beginning of the game.  Which brings me to actually review the game because it frustrates me so much and I wanted to post a review and give a head's up, before you decided to buy the game.   I do recommend this game even though you are going to get frustrated as **** as the devs try to patch up the game as it goes. lol",

It's almost like Evolve but so much more in depth with all the getting generators and avoiding the killer. Its hide in seek with death! This game also has progression that is fantastic. I get why they made it if you don't get over so many points you don't pip. Its so you don't have people at rank 1 just get there and be done. It give some lively hood and progression. On top of that the idea to restart ranks every month or whatever it is, its a good idea to keep the game alive.

Most of the people having problems with the game post discussion threads, despite stickied posts on it and about two dozen others like it, because they did not take the time to investigate the game prior to.  The game does not have ranked mode with friends currently. Why? - It creates an unfair advantage as the friends can use VOIP to coordinate against the killer. - ^ This ruins the immersion and is not the way the devs want it to be played. - This issue was noticed early in development, it is being worked on; however, this requires balance so that the killer is not underpowered. - It's far too easy for a friendly killer and a friendly survivor to farm a crapload of blood points.  Solution? There's a mode for it and it's the top priority of the dev team; it will allow up to 3 friends to play (based on current information). They've been working on it for over a week, so bare with them or honestly GTFO and stop whining. No one gives a crap about you refunding.  There's no microphone or chat. What kind of teamwork game doesn't let you communicate? - Communication, microphone or text, ruins the immersion of the game. - It creates an unfair advantage 4v1.  - The devs specifically did not want it as a feature. - You CAN get by without communicating. If your team sucks, they suck; however if you find good players, you will notice an unspoken communication between them, as with all games. - This is NOT necessarily a teamwork based game. You can be as selfish as you want if it gets you to the end. It's all up to your playstyle.  You can't rebind keys. - On the way, I believe it was 2nd or 3rd in the dev to do list.  You can't change specific graphic settings. - ^^ It's either 2nd or 3rd on the dev to do list. - You should be able to change settings by forcing them with your GPU's control center.  The game is poorly optimized. - This is true and it needs to be improved upon. The Beta ran FAR smoother than the current build is for me.  Sabotaging costs too much toolbox charges; flashlights barely work. - Toolboxes were pretty OP during the beta, but they overnerfed them to be absolute crap. Flashlights hardly ever work. They need to be buffed/fixed.  There's hook graphical errors that cause players to float/perform weird animations/be entirely non interactable. - This needs to be fixed and has been a problem since beta. It was less of a game breaking bug in beta.  Killers can teleport out of map, thus making the game unplayable for them, by hitting a player simutaneously performing an action. - Been in since beta, but is fairly rare in my experience.  Ranked mode is glitchy/requires too much/I lose ranked progress when killer DCs. - Losing ranked progress while the host DCs has been in since beta, you used to also lose your items, but they fixed that. I don't know if it preserves add ons or offerings. If you find an item, you get to keep it. - It used to be far easier to rank up as you could 1-3 pips based on doing okay, doing great or doing perfectly. It's too hard now to get even 2 pips. - Despite getting enough points for a pip, I've still not gotten pips/lost pips.  Play with friends mode doesn't have matchmaking of any kind. - This needs to be addressed as well. They should also have an optional VC option on friend lobbies that runs in the game (I've heard people speak before in lobbies, so I can't imagine it would be too difficult to implement).  Despite these problems, I still really enjoy this game. I think it could potentially replace L4D2 as a horror-esque, extremely fun to play coop game. If you want to wait a few patches before buying it, go ahead. I totally recommend it. The dev team is passionate but quite small. I intend to stick it out further in hopes the game will improve.",

Only cons is that the matchmaking system at the moment sucks so ♥♥♥♥ing much, you can go several minutes up to 30 minutes without getting any match (Survive With Friends) and there is some bugs of course!

Keep in mind to do this from afar so the killer doesn't harm you. Then, when your friend is dead, throw the game and then block everyone when the killer is running towards them. Hopefully, once the killer realizes you helped him, he'll help you and let you get all the generators and escape via the gates or the latch (latch gives you 7000 for escape, gates only give 5000). Once this has happened, you can brag to your friend about how it was a 'pity win' and that you are just more 'likeable' than him/her.   Oh! And for you people that choose Wraith, there is a special place for you. There is a Cancer Guide for Wraith on Steam somewhere, but I'll summarize it. You just sit by your victims and watch them die as no one can help them and camp around you hoping you'll leave but you won't because you're Wraith and the Wraith is cancer.  *Small Update* Game's changed quite a lot. I like it, sure there was a period where I was ♥♥♥♥ing salty about Myers and Premonition not working on him which made me not play for a bit, but generally I'm okay with it now. The community has gotten 1% better (I haven't looked at discussions recently), so that's fun too. I now have 600+ hours in this game, so that's going to be a real blast to explain to someone else. It's still recommended, though.",

When I first saw the trailer, did not really think much of it, but a while later I watched a streamer play DbD and I was instantly hooked. 1 vs 4 Killer vs Survivor. The killer wants to feed the spider god (all glory), survivors merely want to see another day.   The gameplay mechanics are smooth, they really slip you into the role you are playing and adds to the intense atmosphere. An atmosphere that is only enhanced by elements from horror movies that transitioned so well into different characters, perks, and styles of play. The progression is fun, and does not feel like a grind. Especially since everything is randomized, from maps down to your level up progression. Each survivor/killer character has a different set of perks that are unique to each character, along with some other perks used by all survivors/killers. The trick is that since the progression is randomized, you really have to adapt to what you can get. And that goes triple for the survivors since most of the progression is one use items. But I will say no more as to not give too much away. Would highly recomend this game to anyone really. You do not need to be a fan of the horror genre to enjoy this gem.",

It's already a little brutal that not meeting the mark will make you lose your current pip or even rank down if you have none currently, double that with players who quit in the game and make it harder for you to earn points.   I also encountered a pretty big game bug. On I believe MacMillian Estate, I crouched beside (not underneath) a large rock and for whatever reason my character got stuck there. I could move the camera and trying to move my character only resulted in him slightly jerking to the left or right. It took a few minutes but eventually the killer was able to find me, hit me twice because the first hit still didn't jar me loose, and proceed to hook me.

            "review_text": "Summary:  Overall very unique and compelling gameplay. Would recommend if it seems interesting to you, as it is great value and promises to continue to be in the future. Still a bit rough around the edges to put it midly (at launch it could have passed for an early access title and it could be argued that it still does), but the relatively small dev team is very communicative and seems open to changing their direction to varying degrees based on community feedback. Some bugs have been fixed, others have appeared. Because of this, what follows may be quite subject to change. However, the fact that I still play this game despite its imperfections speaks volumes about its strengths.    Pros:   -The combination of excitement/panic you can feel when you first start playing, especially as a survivor, I haven't quite felt in many other games. This lessens a bit with experience and game knowledge, but that brings its own enjoyment. I wouldn't call it 'horror' though, as it doesn't quite have jump-scares, although I have jerked my mouse in surprise/fear when making a mistake as a survivor. It seems more like a 'Thriller', imho.  -Unique asymetrical multiplayer gameplay. Very different overall feel and power differential than other titles in the same vein.  -Procedurally generated map design. Overall, a particular map will have a similar feel, but will differ in many game-altering ways. The varying locations of objectives, killer hooks and basement, initial spawns, exits and some other doodads on the map will make each game unique. This combined with the increasing killer variability adds a lot of replay value.  -Deep progression system. End-game builds can take hundreds of hours to achieve, unless you get very lucky (see below). There are also cosmetics and other currently minor advantages unlockable by 'prestiging' a character, although it resets all other progress for that character.  -Great value for the money. The devs have hinted that eventual, unconfirmed, paid content (although with maps remaining free to all so as to not split the playerbase) would also tend towards this high value.  -Very different mechanics amongst killers making varied playstyles necessary for both survivors and killers. The game is relatively easy to learn but many aspects which vary widely between killers have a decently high skillcap (e.g.: staying hidden/searching hiding spots well, evading the killer/not losing found survivors, prioritizing objectives smartly, reacting to opponent(s)'s strenghts/weaknesses, possible mind-games, etc.)   -Fantastic audio design that is an integral part of the gameplay. The killer's proximity to you as a survivor will alter the soundtrack, and is a key game mechanic.  -Compelling enough of a game to keep me playing tons despite many cons.   Cons:  -Bugs, glitches: matchmaking issues especially with recently added 'Survive with Friends' mode, several gameplay-affecting bugs/issues, certain remaining game-breaking glitches and other esthetic issues once again make this feel almost like a late early access title at times. This is getting better with time, though some new bugs also have popped up with additions to the game.  -Peer-to-peer multiplayer connection. There are no game servers. The survivors connect to a killer that hosts the game, which ends if the killer leaves/disconnects. The ping of the survivors is therefore based on their connection to the killer, and there is currently no in-game ping indicator, though people have found ways to try to estimate this value. The devs have stated that the game would not have released if it were not for this design decision, and have expressed interest in eventually changing this, but it does not seem likely in the near future, as I gather from their statements.  -Current end-game meta seems pretty strongly established. A few 'Perks' that are initially unique character abilities can eventually be taught to other characters. This combined with current strengths of these abilities makes some of them practically mandatory, and others essentially useless. Player builds therefore more or less converge over time. However, the devs have already made significant balance changes in response to community feedback and their stats, which does seem to have slightly increased options.  -Long grind to achieve aforementioned best character builds, a downside to the deep progression system. To be able to play with the very best setup will take several dozens of hours if you're lucky, and most likely in the order of 100 hours or more. You can still have fun and be very viable without any perks whatsoever with experience, but it is initially very tough to play with no or suboptimal perks.  -Some RNG. While not overwhelming, it still factors in quite a bit. Above, I mentioned you might get lucky and progress your character more quickly. This refers to perk aquisition, which requires points earned through gameplay to unlock, but appears in a random sequence. You may get an essential perk very early, or not stumble across it for a very long time.  -Limited options (audio levels and some detailed graphics options). While these affect gameplay, they have stated that some additionnal options are coming.   -Relatively high minimum requirements. Because things like detailed foliage, fog/mist, lighting and shadows are essential gameplay elements related to stealth, some machines just won't run it well. The game seems poorly optimized, so expect your machine to under-perform compared to other games",

            "review_text": "This game totally shook me. Firstly, I saw a youtuber playing it, was like meh, what's this game, another boring thing on the market, but when I watched 1 episode, I simply loved it, and wanted so bad to buy it, and here I am. 1) This game has great graphics, everything is creepy, as it should be. 2) Interesting mechanics, such as : Perk/offering/addon combinations, crows and sprinting giving away your position, generators repairing strategies, and even more.. 3) Costumization is also a good part here, different characters, unique perks, clothing. (DLC'S) 4) As a killer/survivor type of game, I find this one really cool and has a bright future, so many things can be changed : new killers, new maps, new survivors, new perks that bring new mechanics..  So the point of the game is to play as a killer/survivor :  As a survivor you have to repair a total of 5 generators whilst various things can happen, repairing a generators has a small skill-check so you must be paying attention to that otherwise the killer knows you're there and running around with SHIFT leaves red marks everywhere and dissapear after about 4-5 seconds. Use grass,trees, lockers to hide from the killer.. When all generators are powered up, 2 gates show up, open which one you decide by various reasons, and you win. If you remain alone, there's also a hatch somewhere spawned in the map, you can escape by it.  As a killer, you need to of course stop the survivors from repairing generators and sabotaging. You have an unique weapon depending on what killer you are, with a secondary function (ex. invisibility, placing traps,teleporting..). Hitting a player once lowers their HP to another stage (bleeding), survivor yells because of pain and leaves blood on the ground (blood dissapears after 3-4 seconds) but in exchange, he gets a boost of speed for 1-2 seconds and you need to do an animation in which you clean your weapon or something (making you slow for a bit). Hitting them the second time, you down them, and they can be picked up by you, they can wiggle so they escape out of your grasp, but if you get in time to a hook, you can place them, and the sacrifice begins, that's how survivors die. Survivors can also unhook each other. But of course, strategies come and games will always be different.  I totally recommend trying it at least, it's worth your time (played it 3-4 days in a row, 6 hours a day or so, I was and still am really into it).",

If you are alone you can still try to be a survivor, but you will get a lot negative memories out of it probably, so trying to be a killer when you are alone is probably still a better idea.   It's not easy to get started in the game you will have to die - or let your survivors escape - lots of times before you will actually have the right setup to enjoy it.   I think if I'd really like to summ things up, I would say I recommend this game for those who wants to have fun with friends, even if you want to be a Rank 1, and be one of the bests - which ofc you can achieve alone - it's a hell of a fun to get there with friends. :)",

            "review_text": "I’ll start off by saying this game is definitely one of those games that gives you an adrenaline rush. The concept is simple, complete objectives to escape the killer. In my opinion the mechanics are fairly straight forward and the gameplay is fun for the most part, however this game definitely needs a lot of improvement.  The game feels like an early access game since it is fairly buggy and the matching making feels very unbalanced at the moment. For the most part the level design in the game was great for the type of gameplay, but there were a couple of maps that felt a bit too cluttered and you either couldn’t escape or couldn’t get the player to the hook. In some of the maps, the jumping response times were either delayed or non-existent. I only played a few rounds, but I can see the gameplay getting very repetitive and an additional game mode would be nice, especially if it was one where the survivors had to do objectives to trap or kill the killer (make the objectives a challenge to complete so it isn’t super easy). I found the matchmaking to be a bit unstable, as me or my friends were getting kicked, or there was problems with the host when we were doing a group of 5. In summary, if you want a flawless game, this definitely isn’t for you.  Some positive things about the game however, are the concept is really cool and as I previously stated, it does give you an adrenaline rush. Again, most of the level design was well done for this type of game concept. Gameplay was fairly straight forward, and the perks are a nice touch, but like I said earlier the matchmaking can make that frustrating when you’re a new player against a killer with a high leveled perk. Overall I would recommend this game, even though I found more negatives than positives. I do suggest buying it on sale though due to the fact that it isn’t a “perfect” game. Additionally if you’re a player who isn’t bothered by games that feel unfinished and want to try something new, I would recommend it. ",

The bad thing about this game is that when you are survivor some killers always camp you which ruins the game but this doesn't always happen which is good, it can take a very long time to join a lobby so if you are wanting to be a survivor you'll have to wait a while at times but if you choose to be a killer you don't need to worry about that.   Overall I will recommend this game as it's fun with friends (need at least one other, max of 5 players) doesn't take long to join.",

            "review_text": "█ Played 10 hours during the Beta █  I overworked my Review as reason of the update from the last few weeks.  First of all i like this game. So everything mention after now are acceptable problems that i hope they will work on.  At the release day my friend and me got shock by the fact that this game never left the Beta stadium. Why you asking ?  Because nothing realy works perfect. Bugs and Problems everywhere.  What about now ? A few weeks after the release and hoply a lot of updates.  Everything is better. We got our Survival with friends mode and a lot of bugs disapeared. We also got a new map. That sounds good. Or not ?  Nope. Survive with friends is still buggy and you wait longer than playing rounds. (Realy at the evening we need 15 min to find a lobby) And you need to regroup after each more or less succesfully round.  In my old review i told you a story were i got stuck in the map right in front of an escape option and died because i can´t escape. At least this happend a few more time. I stuck somewhere and i know *yeah, ♥♥♥♥ off. I almost did everything and you ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game don´t want to give my hard earnt victory.* This what is mostly annoying.  I wont tell you something about the community because it is not important. Some player cries about campers some other about perks and so on and so on.  There is a working strategy for every situation. Sometime sacrifizes need to be made. Sadly for those who die.   The light in the dark is to know they are working on DbD and with every Update it got better.  You should by it and have fun with friends or alone as cold blooded killer. But you should know that DbD that kind of simple and wokring game. Player like us need to carry this wounded Game out of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and not working game zone to the game of the games of the game zone.  The moon slowly fades into a smile: 'Youre secret is safe with me.' Or is it a grin ?",

            "review_text": "After a while, four survivors fill the lobby, all finally readying up for a bit of a game. I hover briefly over each to check levels and names: One is called 'Drizzy is AIDS.' I silently tell myself that this player is going to end up being a real jackass.  I run around the level, snatching mo'♥♥♥♥as up in bear traps and slinging people onto meat hooks. It's well-fought, but the team doesn't work together, and divided they fall. After a few minutes, I've gotten three sacrifices. Notably absent from the list? You've guessed it--Mr. AIDS.  Drizzy doesn't even bother to try and start generators. After about five more minutes of running around looking for him, I decide to just wait for him to disconnect or try to escape, passing the time by reading some guides for killers that are new to the game.  Ten more minutes pass. No movement. Nothing in the guides tell me about these sorts of players, but it doesn't take long before it dawns on me: Drizzy is hiding somewhere, trying to force me into quitting in a fit of rage. I smile as I begin the tedious task of checking every damned locker in the level.  Locker after locker with no Drizzies inside pass before I realize that this guy is probably hiding where he assumes I'll never look. I head to the basement, replete with blood, gore, and baling hooks, only to begin checking lockers. I finally get to the furthest locker and open it up, and would you guess who was cowering inside? Drizzy! The reunion is sweet as the P.o.S. starts screaming, right before I lovingly slide his wriggling body onto a sharpened, curved piece of pig iron.  Drizzy doesn't plan on staying there, however: As I watch, he somehow frees himself from my beautiful contraption, only to fall to the floor limping and bleeding. I observe somewhat detachedly, a grin spreading across my face, as our hapless protagonist attempts to run upstairs.  A crude machete cuts Drizzy down as he reaches the top flight, leaving him crawling on the cold stone floors in pools of his own blood. I find myself standing over him, watching curiously as his life meter drains; he drags himself around the map, grunting as he does so.  After about three minutes of me waiting, his life meter finally has only a sliver left. Humming a sweet little show tune to myself, I pick up our friend and drag his ♥♥♥ back to the basement, throwing him up on a hook yet again. I set a bear trap under his feet as he dangles there, looking quite troubled, indeed.   As Drizzy attempts, yet again, to drop himself from the hook into the waiting jaws of the bear trap below, our eyes finally meet. Gazes lock as the pain of torment, loss, and even betrayal simultaneously flash across that beautifully-lotioned face of his. I smile for the last time as I whisper softly to our good friend Drizzy: '-I- am the AIDS, Drizzy... -I- am the AIDS.'   I could have sworn that he nodded, eyes full of recognition as they started to turn gray. He stops struggling, going completely limp. I stroke his sweet, sweet afro as netherworldly appendages arrive to impale him. '-I- am the AIDS, Drizzy. -I- am the AIDS.'  11/10 would be the AIDS again",

Heres the story.  I bought the game and installed it. I'm extremely excited   with a boner in my pants   I load up the game and watch the cutscene. It got me even more pumped.   Skip forward a bit from learning the controls and such. I'm in my first game (survivor) super excited I realise skill checks are not as easy as they seemed but I managed to get the hang of it. Skip forward a couple days.   I have some starting perks (level 10 on Jake park rest are normal) I decided to try out killer.... I had an amazing time as the Trapper. Skip foward a couple more days.   I have saboteur (Sabotages killer hooks rank 2) and a couple more perks and my killers have 20 levels spread over them. Most of my levels are on my survivors. I encourage one of my friends to buy it. He buys it and installs it. I explain the controls a little bit. In the middle of this I notice that my Jake park (my main character) is level 1 (He was 38). I check the other survivors and the killers are the same. I tell him I'm going to restart my game real quick. It doesn't fix. After we play a few games I post what happened in the forums a couple people respond but no fixes until 1 person responds saying that I might be able to if I edit my save file. I asked him if it could get me banned. He responded with a low chance. I decided not to because I have respect for the devs of the game.  I start it up again the next day hoping, No praying that its just something that happened that day. I look through my characters and its still the same.

            "review_text": "I am in the mix about this game. Update: They have announced that there will be a party system implemented :]  (When it isn’t buggy) Positives Survivor This game does a good job of making it atmospheric and a truly chilling experience. I like the fact that the game has skill checks and makes you make a decision. Do you focus on the skill check more or your surroundings? Feeling the heartbeat or the bell go off can send someone into a panic and wonder what is going to happen to them next. That feeling of escaping the killer’s grasp and living at the end is amazing. The game also questions how you are morally. Do you try and save everyone or are you selfish? Do you work on the generators or let everyone else do the dirty work? If you scratch my back will I scratch yours? I have had multiple games where I will save a fellow survivor but that player wouldn’t do the same for me when I got captured or I just leave my whole team behind. The perks and offerings you can obtain are also very good. From toolboxes to medkits this game does a good job I believe on the items you can obtain. Offerings allow you to get extra blood points, put you on a desirable map, etc. If you are the last survivor and your team was slaughtered the game gives you the option of either doing the remaining generators or finding the hatch to escape. This feature is truly amazing because it gives the last person an actual chance to escape and win the game.  Killer Being the killer can be a thrilling experience. Your job is pretty simple, kill the survivors. But I believe it goes bigger than that. You manage the map and check generators to make sure the survivors aren’t trying to turn them on. I’ve had games where I actually herded survivors into a certain on the map because they were too scared to go anywhere else. Putting that fear into the enemy team gives you this feeling that you are really a killer. Cutting down the survivors efforts is really entertaining. Each killer has their own unique way of doing things. The trapper basically sets traps at pivotal points in the map or random locations to attempt to trap someone and take them to a hook for them to be sacrificed. The hillbilly is very good at covering ground and chasing people down. With his chainsaw you can easily put a survivor into a downed state after one sprint. The wraith is very good at sneaking up on survivors seeing as he is invisible and when he goes invisible there is no heartbeat to tell you that he is near till he uncloaks. The bell signals him going invisible or coming out from it and I enjoy putting that fear into someone. Each have their own unique playstyle imo and I found it to be enjoyable.  Negatives There are so many bugs in this game right now that it can ruin all the positives. From people being able to teleport to not being able to vault through a window. I have had my fair share of bugs while playing this game. Lag is another issue that I have ran into a lot. The fact that people can rage quit and that I can earn absolutely zero points for that is ridiculous. I don’t think it’s fair to the killer that someone can do that. But at the same time the killer can quit and I have lost rank points because of that. Another issue is that there is no party system at all in the game. The only way you can play with friends atm is to go into a private match and earn no XP. I can see why the devs would want to do this because then you and your friends can communicate via 3rd party system. But here comes my next issue….there is no way to communicate with the randoms that you have. There is no gesture system, voice lines, or voice chat, absolutely nothing to communicate. You can only type in the lobby before the game starts. So basically you are stuck with 3 other random people that you have can’t say a word to in-game. How does a game that begs for coop and working with each other for a common goal have no communication system? It is unrealistic that the survivors wouldn’t try to talk or signal at all in the situation that they are in.  Opinions I find this game to have it’s ups and downs. There are moments that I am having so much fun trying to run away but that can instantly be ruined by a game breaking bug. If I were anyone I would wait on this purchase till a patch releases stating they fixed some of the bugs. At the current moment this game has too many bugs and it can really ruin the experience. Some of the bugs that were present in the beta are still present in the full game. I would also like to see another way to kill the survivors rather than just putting them on a hook. It kind of gets stale after awhile of just playing these interesting killers but doing the same way to kill a survivor. I feel each killer should of had their own way of killing the survivor. I really enjoy the game for what it is though. I just hope they improve on it.",

            "review_text": "Okay, I'm giving this game a positive rating but my review is going to be very critical.  This game is undoubtedly very fun and I definitely recommend it, but there are some serious issues that are going to need to be addressed.  To start, the game has no dedicated servers. Whoever is playing the Killer is hosting the game. So, you're at the mercy of the Killer's internet connection in order to have a stable/satisfying game. Unfortunately, there's going to be people playing as the Killer with absolutely garbage internet and as a result, the game becomes so laggy that it can literally become uplayable. There's also rumors of killers actually cheating by abusing this and deliberately making their game laggy to give them an advantage while playing. (lagswitch) I don't know how they go about doing it but it's definitely within the realm of possibility.  If adding dedicated servers is out of the question (though that would be the ideal solution), a ping indicator in the lobby before the game begins would give the survivors an idea if their game will be playable or a lagfest when it starts. At least players would know to avoid games where their ping is in the thousands (at which point it's only the people deliberately cheating you'd have to worry about).  My second major complaint is less technical and more balance related; infinite jukes. In a perfect world, the game would function essentially like this. The killer runs faster than survivors so he can catch them. In order for survivors to have a chance, they have to play smart by hiding. When they get spotted, they run for their lives, looking for a way to lose the killer so they can go back to hiding from him. When a survivor runs, they leave a trail of chicken scratch marks in their wake that the Killer can see to track them down. This can be avoided by not running. But first the survivor has to make the Killer lose their trail by confusing him. This can be accomplished several ways. These methods include vaulting through windows/obstacles (to which the Killer can follow albeit extremely slowly) knocking obstacles in the Killer's path via pallets, stunning the Killer by hitting him with the aforementioned pallets, blinding the killer with a flashlight, etc. If successful, the survivor's skill will be rewarded when the Killer loses their trail and they can go back to hiding and working on a way to escape. Unfortunately, there's one very serious flaw with the game's current design. Infinite jukes.  There are several sections in every single map where there are multiple obstacles a survivor can vault past very close to one another. As a result, when the Killer chases a survivor to one of these spots, unless the survivor misplays, it's literally not possible for the killer to capture the survivor. They simply need to vault past an obstacle and when the Killer either follows (again, very slowly) or tries to go around, the survivor can simply move to the next obstacle and vault again. Rinse and repeat indefinitely.  There is one Killer that has a chance at countering this problem, The Trapper, which can set bear traps in an attempt to prevent this abusive mechanic, but it's far from a perfect solution. Survivors have methods of disarming and even destroying these traps. Not to mention the other two killers have no legitimate counter to this whatsoever. So quite literally speaking, a pro-survivor has, and I'm not exaggerating here, literally has 0 chance at losing this game. They simply can't be caught. They can survive indefinitely and the only chance the Killer has at capturing these players is hoping they misplay at some point so they can land a lucky hit. However, this infinite juking is not difficult at all, so the chances at misplaying are very small.  Now, I believe the devs understand that this is an issue and are working towards a solution that hopefully everyone can be happy with. Until then though, the game can be very frustrating for both Killers and survivors. I mean, it's no fun as a survivor to simply hop through windows repeatedly because a stubborn Killer won't give up and it's no fun for the Killer knowing it's simply not possible to capture a stubborn survivor that won't stop abusing this obviously broken mechanic. Unfortunately, until survivors simply no longer have this as an option, it'll continue to be abused time and time again.  Unfortunately, there are also other issues that are not in the game's favor in the way of bugs. This game has an unhealthy number of bugs, some of which are quite minor while others are very disruptive to the game. The bugs as of this review that I personally am aware of are as follows:  *Survivor getting stuck being unable to move. There seem to just be certain spots on the map that if you're unlucky enough to run across it, you'll just get stuck. (Haven't noticed it on a Killer yet and this is actually quite rare)  *Survivor disconnecting, yet not being registered as a disconnect, leaving an unresponsive invulnerable survivor, preventing the game for the Killer from ending (forcing them to quit, which results in no points and a down-rank)  *Blank spots in the Bloodweb (the way in which you unlock new abilities by spending earned points). You spend points to unlock items and abilities in a web, unlocking one thing will open the path to unlocking the next thing and then the next thing(s) etc. There are times one spot in the path will simply be blank, preventing you from not only purchasing what should have been there, but blocking the path to any item/ability that purchase would have led to. Very disruptive to the game.  *Various graphical glitches that range from funny looking characters to a game breaking 'nothing on the map loaded, so I'm running into invisible walls!' (the latter may very well be lag related and not actually a bug).  *The killer occasionally getting stuck in place while carrying a surivor that disconnects.  There are probably other bugs, but these are the ones I can recall off the top of my head.  So, you may be wondering, 'Well damn Casm! If this game has as many issues as you're saying it has, why the hell are you giving this game a positive review!?' The simple answser? Because when it's plays right, the game is just crazy good and loads of fun. I'm also giving the devs some benefit of the doubt in assuming the most of the disruptive bugs are going to be fixed and that the infinite juking will ultimately be balanced. The bugs, while plentiful are relatively rare and when you do come across players that have enough respect to not abuse obviously broken mechancs, the cat and mouse style of hide and seek is extremely addictive and entertaining for both survivors and killers. In short, right now the game is good and when these issues are eventually (hopefully) addressed, the game will be that much better.  I will stipulate though that the ball is very much in the developer's court and in order for this game to maintain this positive review, (and probably others) these issues HAVE to be addressed. If enough time passes and the game is still riddled with the flaws laid out here, then I just won't be able to continue recommending the game as I currently am.",

            "review_text": "Amazing game, I simply love it i only have a few problems 1. True every game has it's glitches at launch and this game has very few but the ones i have encountered are game breaking. For example, As a killer, being unable to move after picking up a survivor you dropped 5 seconds ago. 2. When being sacrificed as a Survivor, if another survivor comes to your aid to pull you down, if they are interuptted by the killer, the entity will immediately kill you, in my opinion there she be another prompt to struggle for your life. 3. Wraith and it's blood webs are game breakingly overpowered, new players can't even begin to hope to stand a chance against Wraith players, espically if they use the All Seeing Eye Mudd blood web perk(When clocked you can see Survivors from up to 6meters away, this is when it is un-upgraded). 4. You can't invite friends to online matchmaking games if slots are empty (However I heard from several people stating that 'it will be added soon') 5. Some props in the word don't have correct collision/hitboxes and therefore may impede your walking/sneaking/ running for your life. 6. Servers could use a small stability upgrade. Up sides, 1. Super fun to play as both Survivor and killer. 2. Blood webs allow you to expand on how you play your Survivor or blood-thirsty Killer 3. Is incredibly effective at getting the emotions and reactions that the devs wanted of the player base (search dev diary on youtube) 4. Maps are well fleshed out and are terrifying and ominous at the same time. 5. Customizable Survivor and Killers for all those fashionable scaredy cats and rampaging pyscho murderers out there. 6. Just came out so there are plently of potential changes that could make the game even more bad ♥♥♥. 7. Perspectives of Survivor and Killer differ in a way that you could feel as if you actually ARE your character. I rate this game and 9/10.",

Intense in the fact that it can touch both sides of the spectrum : One being helpless and terrified and the other feeling a sense of tremendous guilty pleasure when stabing a helpless survivor.  I would like to think of this game as a really good horror film that lingers on in your mind for weeks after the fact and for a horror movie enthusiast I more than welcome this. It has a really unique set of characters (Mostly from the killer aspect) and a really fun objective orientated style gameplay both for the killer and the surivors. When you combine these two elements with the amazing settings of the maps you get a really good product.  One of the best reasons why I personally like this game aside from the actual gameplay and amazing detail into character/map design is the fact that ping isn't a major factor in this game. As a person living in South Africa I can firmly say that I play an abundance of online competitive games with a 200-250 ping handicap, and it's increadibly frustrating. However, in this game it isn't the case, ping hardly affects me and I can play without this handicap and it feels great. Don't get me wrong I obviously still have that ping, but it isn't a major factor.   There are a few issues I have with this game though. 1: The bugs, the bugs with mostly the trapper killer and the survivor being bugged in a trap whilst rescuing their friend. It really destroys the mood however funny it may be the first 1-3 times it happens. This is just 1 of the most common bugs I have come across and it really destroys both the immersive experience as well as that current game. There are a few more bugs but its best not to divulge further into them or else I would be nit-picking. 2: Alot of disconnecting randomly for no reason, due to 'anti-cheat'. Followed the solutions people came up with and yes fair enough they worked to a certain extent, but only to have the game disconnect 3 games following.  3: Matchmaking; The matchmaking in this game feels really inconsistent. I will be in a group of 20 ranked survivors from fresh installs only to have a rank 1 killer with a long list of perks and experience. Yes, I know how matchmaking works and it's not the easiest thing to do with 100% efficiency but that seems odd, especially since it happens more than 50% of the time to me and my group of friends.  All that aside, the game feels and looks great and I really hope the devs keep releasing new content that we all could get excited for.  I would highly recommend this game if you're a fan of horror games that are done properly that can give you a good scare even after your 50th time playing it.  If I were to give this a numeral rating I would say 7/10.",

            "review_text": "UPDATED review (after more hours of playing it)  The game still is absolutely great. With that, I mean that the concept and the style of gaming. However, it is not near perfection.  The match-making in 'survive with friends' still is terrible. When there is a round of 4 people (filling the survivor spots available), sometimes you have to wait up to 45 minutes to find a match and then, one has to be lucky so the killer does not leave the lobby because he knows he has to play against a group of four people that will most likely communicate. Unfortunately, I do not know how the matchmaking works in DbD, but I wonder if it so difficult to make that a full survivor group gets one killer assigned to them.  Also, there are of course different ways to play a game, for survivors as well as for killers, but is massive camping really a good way? It is terribly annoying to have a camping killer, and it often (also heard that from friends and other players) leads to quitting the game - because when I e.g. play four matches, there's at least two of the killers that are camping. It's not great for those who want to save people from hooks, but also for the hooked one.  Before someone complains and says, this would be necessary to get enough points - that is not true. Just check out e.g. tru3ta1ent or other high-ranked DbD-players. Most of them aren't camping. Also, for most survivor players, it is alright when the killer walks around in the area around the hooked survivor. Standing directly in front of the hook, however, is not.  I no longer think a game mechanic that makes it unable for the killer to stay near the hook would be good, but maybe after the match, an up and downvoting system or sth. like that is an idea? Or that the amount of bloodpoints the killer receives for sacrificing is decreased when being in a 10 meter radius around a hooked one.   I appreciate the change in the game where you no longer see the rank and level of the other survivors. This stopped lobby hopping almost entirely and with it, had a positive effect on the game.  Again, the matchmaking is still annoying. I don't think it is a good matchmaking when all four survivors are low-level (Anything under rank 16 and three perks or less for me) and low-rank (anything from 20-16), and they have to play against top-level top-ranked killer. That results in a heavily unbalanced game - which is annoying.  Something, that in my opinion is still missing (but, I imagine it is not easy to implement), is the private lobby leveling. I hope that one will never be able to spend their private-lobby gained bloodpoints for their online character, but I expect this won't happen. But for private fun, it would be nice to have a seperate leveling.   Now that the release is already a while back, it's very nice to see that there's still so many people playing all the time - which is positively about the game and shows the potential it has. But only because there are so many players, it does not mean the game can be neglected. There's (in my personal opinion) still A LOT to do. But I think and hope, the developers won't fool around with it.    Following was my first review after a few hours of gaming, BEFORE the release of Survive with friends mode.    9/10 Points - this game is worth it's (fitting) price! It is a lot of fun, excitement and gets your heart active! Very cool idea and only a few bugs (I have yet discovered).",

It also needs more variety in game modes like Dead Realm did and also a lot more killer and survivor types but that's just a minor complaint i'd rather they make a way to play in smaller groups without forcing it to be a private match. In the end it's a great game with an intresting type of gameplay which is rarely seen in games anymore just if you want to buy and you barely have any friends to play it with wait until they add a group mode but i still recommend it if your looking for a fun game on your own or with a group of 5. (Edit: Now they have added a feature that is a party mode the game is a lot more enjoyable with friends... IF you're patient enough to wait to get into a match which takes a while because you have multiple people but when you do get into a game it helps a bunch when wanting to play with friends this game still needs time to be updated, tweaked and improved but right now it's one of the most fun games on Steam that i've seen in a while so i say give it a try and if it's not your thing then fine just don't go trying to ruin the experience for others).",

The atmosphere is spooky, the heartbeats make you paranoid of where the killer is coming from, and feeling like an hero if you heal somebody or taking them off a hook running away freely.  Dead by Daylight is a 4v1 game where all 4 survivors must work together to get generators to work so they can escape to the exit from a savage killer (there are 3 killers at the moment) that will try to take you down and hook people to sacrifice them, but getting hooked sucks right? Well in this game, friends have a option that can take risk by saving you from the hook or just leave you to get sacrificed.  What I like about the game is that you can use bloodpoints that you get from playing matches as killer or survivor, and using them to get perks that help you throughout your gameplay, offerings that are only 1 time use in matches that can help anyone or just yourself, and add-ons for your medkit, toolkit, flashlight, and a skeleton key.  Here are some problems I got with the game -Matchmaking seems slow to me so it's probably me or the game -infinites are still a thing so i'm glad devs are still working on this after the patch of infinites  These are the only 2 problems I had with the game and my friends had some bugs I couldn't get to watch. As i'm saying is that it's alright, but I hope they will be fix later on by patches (hopefully). Party system is here so i'm glad but matchmaking seems slow again.  In conclusion that this game is good and fun, but matchmaking seems odd and infinites are still a thing (killers gotta hope for Shelter Woods).",

            "review_text": "Despite as of lately there has been a stream of salty reviews, I find Dead by Daylight to be one of the funnest multiplayer games I've ever played in a long time.  My personal opinion is I enjoy games with:  - An in-depth progression system in both casual and competitive formats (character levels and forced ranked system make every game you play matter, no matter how well it went) - Interesting and fitting music and atmosphere combination - A steep learning curve that promotes learning from your mistakes and evaluating yourself after every game - A great balance of being rewarded by efficient teamwork, while also not being completely subdued to failure from terrible teammates - The said progression system rewards you with ways to change up your play for every match and differentiates you from other players, even with a set meta installed on what's good and what's bad - A way for solo gameplay to not make you anxious about what your teammates do and what they think about you (mainly caused by lack of chat, and a rewarding point system for helping eachother out)  The game has all of this.  Yes, there's some flaws and bugs. Some balancing issues as well. But most people complain about things in the game that I find are not a problem to begin with; like difficulty of playing as a survivor, perks being extremely strong when you're higher leveled, lack of communication in game, lack of group matchmaking (EDIT: THEY ADDED THIS IN, and it works just fine with a few queue'ing issues but still playable) and how hard it is to rank up as a survivor.  All I need to say is that the game fits my expectations on what makes a multiplayer game fun and is one of the only multiplayer games out there that makes me play all by myself from day and night, and all of the decisions they made that many other people don't like are justified in my rightful opinion.   And most of all, it's one of those games where you spend time progressing to get new things and at the same time you will notice yourself getting better and better as you play more and more.   It's just a highly rewarding experience, and a lot of fun too.",

Now that's not to say the game isn't pretty damned entertaining in it's current state but to say it's not missing palpable content just doesn't feel right.  Anyway I did have fun with the game but I just didnt feel it was totally a finished product.   bugs? a few ones now and again. I actually couldn't run the game without crashing on ultra settings and my machines a beast. Other than that there are a few here and there but nothing that ive found to be game breaking.

I hate that I may be level 5 playing with people who are level 50 and have all these perks that I can't compete with. It puts me at an extreme disadvantage and makes leveling up harder. Also the survivor rank idea is just dumb and not neccessary, it's hard for me to even get passed 20 (the base rank). I also personally find the Wraith's disappearing power not very fun to play with as I've never really won a game against one for obvious reasons. There are also some frustrating techniques players use such as killers remaining in the spot where they hung someone, killers putting a bear trap right in front of the hook, and reappearing as the wraith while i'm in a corner so I can't get out. These kinds of things frustrate me, as I feel like I'm at an extreme disadvantage which discourages me from playing. Of course I would also like more characters and maps but the bugs should be worked out first. Overall it's really fun, especially when you're just with friends. Online is just really frustrating.

For people who do not like Horror genres, being scared or the adrenaline spike you get after playing the most brutal game of Hide and Seek ever, you do NOT want to play this game.  Having said that.....  Holy jumping Jesus, this game is crazy CRAZY addictive. Let's start out with the game itself. You and three other survivors are on a randomly generated map, with a killer who's only purpose is to kill you by sacrificing you on a meat hook. You escape by finding five generators on the map and repairing them, which reveal the exit(s). During this time you are unable to communicate with your fellow survivors, saving pre-arranged signals developed before the match started.    Any noise you make alerts the killer and displays on his screen. ANY noise. Screw up a generator repair, he hears it. Wimpering in a closet while he's going by, he hears it. Knock a pallet down, you guessed it. The map is large and varied, so the killer may be on the other side of the map, or he might be in the cornfield with you. The only way you know for sure is the scary music with violins ramps up and your heartbeat starts getting really loud. If he gets close enough to you, you'll spot his field of vision as a red mist near the ground. Note to new players, if you can see the red glow behind you, chances are good you are hook-bait. Survivor's play in third-person mode, whilst the killer plays in first-person mode. This allows the survivors to have 360 degree vision, whilst the killer is only able to see in directly in front of him.   Now in addition to all of this, there is a Meta-game as well. Your characters may be equipped with items such as first aid kits, toolboxes, maps etc. etc. purchased with Bloodpoints (XP) or found in each match in chests littered about the sprawling map. These items give you bonus's and help you escape; however, if you are caught with one in the map and are sacrificed, you lose it permanently. Conversely, if you find an item in the map and escape with it, it is part of your inventory (until you are sacrificed with it, losing it). This makes it a double challenge on the map as you are looking for generators and items, while keeping an eye out for the killer who is probably behind you.  There are currently four survivors to choose from and three killers. It's simply amazing. The more I play, the more I want to play. Get this game. Unless you are not a horror genre fan, this game is a must buy.",

Queuing with friends does not work at least 80% of the time and you will be hardpressed to actually get into a game when it does work. Killers just leave when they see things in the lobby that are 3spooky5them (i.e. rank 17 survivors, flashlights equiped). This is being fixed™ but it should have been a day 1 change.  Balancing is an issue as well. Too many perks on both sides promote unfun gameplay elements. Hook camping with the addition of the 7,000 point PIP reward in a recent patch removes the incentive for killers to roam. Survivors have it way too good with destroying hooks, pigeonholing the killer into running mackerbaiting arm 3 so he can actually hook people.  There are no dedicated hosts either, so prepare for every 3rd game to be nearly unplayable due to foreign players queueing to other regions for EZ points.  Beware.  -----------------------------------------  EDIT:  This game is now better. Queueing in multiplayer works (queue times vary from 30s to 6m).

            "review_text": "Dead By Daylight is a very fun game, one of the funnest games I've played in a while. While is this game so fun you ask? Well silly, you're not supposed to ask questions nowadays. But I'll tell you why anyways.  In my opinion, there are two very important things that make this game worth playing. First of all, this game is not like any other horror game I have ever played. Almost every single horror game I've played is 'OoooOoo! Watch out! The boogeyman is out to get you!'. Now don't get me wrong, there is a villian that is out to get you. However, this game doesn't try to rub it in your face. Another thing I like about the villians you are going against is that you aren't playing against an AI, you are playing against another human being. This means they have their own tactics and ways of getting you. There is also more than one killer which consist of The Trapper, The Hillbilly, The Wraith, and The Shape. I will not talk about what makes them unique but they all have their own unique way of playing them. Now that we know how that the killers do not all act the same and that they are real people (Most of the time, sometimes you end up with bots. But those are rare and are broken now so they are free bloodpoints), we can talk about the other fun parts of the game.  The next fun part about the game is the way it instills horror into the survivor running from the killer. One of the way's it lets you know a killer is near is that it uses music that gradually increases in tensity like in movies when something bad is going to happen. I find this much more effective than jumpscares, and actually keeps me on my seat (Where as FNAF would get old fast, as when I knew they would happen it would be like someone going boo). The same goes for the person playing as the killer. While the killer doesn't have music that gets more tense when he gets close to a survivor (As that would be overpowered), he gets his own chase music when he indeed finds a survivor. There is also one more thing that I love about the survivor and the killer, their perspective. This is the first game I have ever played that switches between first and third-person depending on the situation and I think it is a great balance technique. The survivor is in third person, which lets them see the killer from other places than right in front of them. The killer is stuck in first person, making him have to constantly look for survivors and can't see multiple at the same time unless they are right in front of him.  Now, this doesn't mean the game comes without it's cons.  In my opinion, when the game first came out, it was very, very glitchy when it came to lobbies. This meant that it could take ages to get into a lobby and if it ever failed to find one it would end up making you have to ready up again. This doesn't seem to bad until you're in a survive with friends lobby where you all have to ready up again. This has been fixed though, which I am very thankful for! There is still a problem with the hosting though. Instead of having a dedicated server for the survivor and killer to connect to it relies on the killer to be the host. This means that if the host has crappy internet everyone has to deal with it. This means that you could end up going to different locations randomly during a chase (Which it is vital in such a time to stay away from the killer) and could end up causing you to be downed by the killer. Not fun. While I think this is a way to let the game last even after the game is dead and not played by many people, I would prefer the servers be hosted in a traditional way (By the games company) then when the game had it's servers shutdown switch to the method where the killer is the host.  This game also has DLC, which I consider a con most of the time. And here's why. Whenever I buy a product, I want that product to be FINISHED. Tell me, when you buy a cheeseburger, does the restaurant make you pay extra for the pickles? Well if they do you shouldn't go to that restaurant. But you get my point. However, this game is not too bad with it. It's DLC is pretty cheap, goes on sale alot of the times, and normally adds a lot of content. I would say the only DLC that I consider pay to win in this game is Michael Myers (The Shape) as he has a very easy way of downing the survivors.  TL;DR  Pros: Cool villians, great atmosphere Cons: Overpowered DLC, uses weird lobby system.",

Then in the silence, a faint heartbeat is heard...you know the killer is close. As the heartbeat gets louder you decide it's better to survive than be caught, so you slowly creep away to hide behind a boulder. But it was too late, the killer spotted your crouched silhouette and starts lumbering right towards you. You sprint away, not worrying about the trail you leave behind, all that matters now... is escape. You run, looking for any path that could throw him off your trail. The heartbeat is now accompanied by a anxiety inducing grinding noise...you know he's closer. You dodge around trees and hay bales, hoping he slips up. The music and heartbeat more intense than ever and now a red glow shines on your back. You know he is right behind you know. Your blood flushes from your head, and just as the killer swings their weapon, you slam a pallet down between the two of you, stunning the killer. As you hear his moans of frustration at his ruined kill, you hop through an open window and slowly crawl out into cover. You crouch in hiding, as you watch him search the area for you. He eventually give up chase and goes off to find another survivor. You crawl away, looking for the next generator to repair and hopefully make way for your escape.     If you've ever played Amnesia, then you know about the water filled hallway sequence. Dead by Daylight is that...but for the whole time...and it's awesome! This is honestly one of the best games I've played in a long time. Are there balance tweeks to be made? Yes..But every game like this has tweeks to be made. It's a constant balance that doesn't ever really end, and I think the devs are doing a great job at it. The feeling of escape or the feeling of a perfect kill is great. Being the last survivor and finally escaping through the hatch after a long cat and mouse game is also one of the big highlights of this game.  Dont let the naysayers with 'OP!' and 'It's BROKEN!' and 'UNFAIR!' throw you off... Don't get bitter, get better and get this game! Oh...and stay away from the dungeons...bad juju down there.",

I use some 'weaker' perks that imho are even better than sprint burst.  I am not sure what other things make people 'dislike' this, but I like what devs are doing with the game.

It takes far too long to find a game because of this system, as well as ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you off in the process -Bugs: many have been fixed, but they do exist and can ruin a round for you -Ranking system: why is there only 1 matchmaking mode and it is competitive?! Honestly, it is pretty silly -Players: there will always be camping killers and weak-willed survivors that ruin rounds for you, but thats a staple in every multiplayer game now-a-days  Overall, it's worth the buy if you want to have some scary, asymetrical horror fun, especially if you have some friends who play it!!

My best suggestion is to never group up and to only work on the generators one at a time... some person always comes up and blows my generator up when I'm doing just fine and gets me killed!",

With the 3 killers my favorite is the trapper which can put traps in most places. I would suggest if you are very bad at quick time events and like this game then be a killer since everything a survivor can do has quick time events in it except moving around the map. Even with the nerfs the survivors received they can still win. If you like horror games that are eventful then I suggest this game.",

            "review_text": "  Here is a full review. Survivors: These are the survivors, all their special perks and what not. Dwight. If you wanna be a team supporter, use him. His perks become useless if you are the only survivor left pretty much.Bond you can find survivors in a certain radius Leader Healing, generators and etc are increased depending on how many people are by you. Prove thyself makesh ealing speeds go faster depending on how many survivors are by.  Claudette ( Idk how to spell ): Self care is one of the best perks in this game, hands down you can heal your self and clutch. Empathy is a team perk. You can find injured survivors. Botany knowledge Basically stop bleeding pretty much but you can still bleed so.  Meg: Sprint burst is great like you can run away so fast and get away from the killer easily. Adrenaline is good if you are hurt and the exit gates are powered. Heal plus sprint burst :) Quick and quiet is kinda useless but you become less quick when going into lockers and going over obstacles like boards so.  Jake park: Saboteur You can break the trapper's traps and hooks so it's good but it gets annyoing for the killer lol. Calm spirit makes it so animals like crows pretty much not make sound and they trust you so it doesn't really alert the killer. ( By making noise ) and iron will when you are standing still, you don't make as much sound when standing still like grunts when injured when standing still. It's not the best but it is good for hiding when hurt so.  Nea: ( New survivor ) This girl wow. She is not the bst but it good for 2 perks pretty much. Balanced landing: When falling at high distances like high places, you don't stop and gain your balance, you can still run. ( kinda useless in some maps. ) Urban Evasion: You can crouch walk faster then normally. So yeah it's ok and the last perk is the best one out of all of these. It uses less consumption of items and it affects other survivors in the radius of nea :3  Killers: These guys are eh. I like them and don't like that. Here are the killer's special perks. Trapper: Special ability Traps. Place them and trap survivors. Agitation makes it so you can transport bodies faster while transporting a survivor to a hook. Brutal Strength You can destroy boards faster pretty much. It is good if you can get it :3 Unnerving presence. It triggers skill checks for healing, repairing generators and other stuff that have skills checks for survivors when they are near you.   The HillBilly: My favorite NOT, he can literally one shot you basically with his chainsaw. Enduring you can recover faster from being stunned by boards. Lightborn You can recover from flashlight stuns faster pretty much. You also are resistance to strong lights pretty much idk how to explain so rip. Tinkerer. Addons that affect your power are pretty much better now.  The Wraith: Gosh this guy is so annoying to play against to counter him when he cloaks/goes in invisible, hear his growls or you can see his outline when he cloaked. Bloodhound: When you hit a survivor, fresh blood tracks are more visable pretty much Predator: Tracks created by disturbances like failing a skill check and the generator explodes and a survivor runs or they complete and generator and run or walks away, tracks basically stay there longer then normal. Shadowborn: Your vision is bigger and better now pretty much and light is 50% more effective on you. Like flashlight stuns and what not.  The nurse: New killer. Blink basically her teleport is her special.  Stridor: Breathing is louder on survivors.  Thanatophobia: Hooked/injured/downed survivors pretty much give other survivors a harder time healing, fixing generators and what not.  A Nurse's calling: Basically you can see survivors getting healed in a radius which is kinda broken.   TLDR: Here is just some guides on what perks to use for the killers and survivors. At the top is also special perks for each killer and survivor.  For survivors: Use Saboteur, Self care, sprint burst and premonition or spine chill.   For supporting team, use bond, leader and prove thyself with maybe empathy? To go save people and what not.   Escaping death perk: Adrenaline, sprint burst self care and Premonition  For Surviving use premonition, Spine chill, Self care and sprint burst. Now you may be asking your self experienced players, why spine chill and premonition? Because look, if premonition goes off and it's the wraith or something, you know that the killer is near and you can use spine chill to your advantage and look around for the killer while using spine chill.  Saving survivors 101. We'll make it, No one left behind, Empathy and prove thyself.  Last one is... Getting rid of annoying things. Sabotuer, Smallgame, This is not happening and Slippery meat.   Killer guides for perks: I recommend these perks. Iron grasp, Thanatophobia, Unrelenting and Deerstalker.  Rushing over to the survivors one at a time, Brutal Strength, Deerstalker, A Nurse's calling and Predator.  The cheap killer. No one escapes death, Bitter murmur, Agitation and iron grasp. ( Not saying iron grasp is cheap but paired with agitation and they are both level 3 and ultra rare, it is gg. )   So yeha. This is my revivew if you wanan skip everything. Dead by daylight is a great game with broken bugs, killers, survivors, perks everything. This game used to be waiting simulator 2016 but now it is fast simulator.  I love this game but it is a bommerang basically.  I also got this game gifted by my friend thanks man.    ",

            "review_text": "Is it perfect? No. Is it fun? Bloody hell yes.   This game isn't going to be for everyone. Odds are you ARE going to be helpless as a suvivor. That's the point. Survivors are suppose to be helpless against a Killer. As a suvivor you don't play to win games, you play to survive them. And as a Killer you play to do one thing and only one thing, kill. If you don't like being helpless against an unstopable Killer IF he finds you, then odds are you aren't going to like Dead by Daylight. But if you are smart. Then either the Survivors or Killer can turn the odds in their favor to make fools out of the other.  Pros- -Playing as a slasher flick killer. 3 of them with more in the works. -Being a victim of a slasher flick. Escape death with skill, maybe just dumb luck, or die in soiled pants. -4v1 gameplay that goes extra lengths to make each side stand apart from the other. -Great use of sounds for information. -RNG tile based maps. 1-2 landmarks per map will aways be in the same places, but everything else will change every game. -Games last 10 minutes on average.  Cons- -Some model bugs like rarely seeing your own hair/eyes as a Killer or some janky movement with Killers interacting with suvivors. -Balance. One Killer is weaker than the other 2. Windows close together can make near 100% safe zones for survivors depending on a few things. Some perks are rather annoying, maybe a touch OP. -Games have no timers. If someone wants to waste your time, they can if they are good enough. -No communication. It is impossible to talk to each other without 3rd party chats like Steam, Teamspeak, Skype, ect. -Making a lobby as a Killer can take up to 10 minutes to fill. Not from player counts mind you. Either another bug or a waiting list with strict 'first come, first filled' rules.  In short-  For $20 you are going to get one hell of a fun game! Just note that it might not be for everyone as not everyone can handle playing as victims who are by design made to be helpless more often than not.",

Add a Zone where the Killer has to stay like 10 - 20 m away from the Trap because most of the People (Killers) always waiting infront of me untill i die so the others could not help me. 3. Add more Clothes for the Skins. 4. Add the option for a Party so you can play with Online with Friends and some Strangers. 5. Add more Skins for the Killer and the Survivors.  6. Add the option for the First-Person mode. 7. I found a Bug that makes Survivors Invisible. It happens when you are on a chop and its 1 sec left untill you die and a Survivor comes to help you.

As a game that I do truely like and matches my preference, the flaws however is just ridiculous.  flaws:  1.It's not as glitchy but it can be glitchy  2.They need to do something about hook campers, or atleast some how force the team to kind of work together to get people off hooks. for example: Maybe lock the generators until your whole team is off the hooks? but whatever generator your on you can finish until you either exit off of it or you finish it. (it's just something to think about but that could have lots of flaws in that example to.)  3. I hate the fact that when you enter the game people could just leave and refuse you points. They should have some other kind of punishment instead of just losing rank or something like that. Like have an automated system to which they actually start to ban people if they leave?  4. Another one is that you can't even invite your friends to play in a public game and you play with total strangers with no chat, no VoIP. Not anything to communicate with your team. A lot of those people won't even come to help you and you lose rank for pretty much at the beginning of the game or after you did alot of stuff for the team.  Now even know I listed 4 flaws this is the bad stuff I experienced. Now away with the negativity and in with the positivity.  Pros: 1.It's a pretty good game for an adrealine rush, they did an amazing job to make you want to panic in times you feel like doing it, I can't help myself to always hop out of my spot everytime I see the monster coming at me but don't actually see me yet.  2. It's a great game afterall for teamwork and it makes you feel like you are just rewarded for baiting and for saving your team off of hooks.  3. It's very atmospheric with alot of the maps and makes you feel like your in a horror movie.  4. I love some of the perks you can get with killer, like the one that makes their skill check come up more then it usually does to the point when you are near a generator they panic and mess up.  5. Last but not least it's a good game after all just to make you feel like an adrealine junkie and make you freak out in dire situations.",

You can tell by my play time that I don't know if that changes when your higher levels and have a lot of perks unlocked items and sacrifices but given how this game works now it seems fine and dandy.   Also, don't ♥♥♥♥ing put in party systems. That's not what this game is supposed to be about. When you get thrown into a survivor situation like this you don't get to choose your lifelines/partners to escape. There would be practically no betrayals among the survivors, there would be no sense of uncertainty on whether or not you can rely on another survivor to come to your aid if your caught and or hung on the hook. This game is awesome the way it is, I love playing as both survivor and killer but if you implement a party system in this game so people can easily strategize against the killer then you have a scenario of being the survivors are too easy (even if your the one stranger and your playing with three people who know eachother) and if they know eachother and your the odd one out 9/10 they will probably allow you to be sacrificed and just care about their buddies only. Which will be boring. THe killer will be screwed with as if he wasn't the tormenter but the tormented which is not why this game was made or why any of us bought it. For those who bought it for that reason... well your wrong sorry but it's that simple.  It's unfortunate that I can see in the recent news section of my library that I already see the devs talking about Party chat implementation. GG probably will stop playing this if it's not balanced properly.  Edited: I realize I said I'd probably stop playng this even though I gave it a recommendation but I'll change the recommendation to not recommended when and if they actually make the game broken with this party system.  Edited reloaded: Hey guess what it's kinda broken. Honestly not as bad as I thought it would be but I've noticed it to be way more difficult to get more then 1 kill per game maybe I just suck but I remember wherer only 1 survivor would get away from me before. Ah well I still like the game and it's still recommended.",

There's no in between. You can't play with two of your buddies and fill the other slots with randoms. -No in game voice chat. Communication is important when playing as a survivor. When playing online, there's no way to talk or type to your teamates. -Repetetive. Grinding out the same game type with only a difference in maps, the killer's play type, and your perks. -Unless you play with friends this game will get old fast.   I would say for me that it was worth the $20 because some of my friends own the game. I don't enjoy playing the online game mainly because I'm all alone due to the lack of communication. Though this game is great with friends, there should probably be a cheaper method to buy a package deal to give to friends, similar to the beta.",

Unless they get away....but when they dont its oh so good. (Damn those pesky flashlights btw. Pain to use and a bigger pain if your the monster.) I will admit though playing against higher ranked monster or survivors with rare perks is a bit lopsided and could use some tweaks or limiters for playing with people of similar skill.

            "review_text": "So after watching some guys on YouTube play this game and looking like they were having a total blast, I decided I could risk the seventeen dollar price. So I'll do a pros and cons thing first and then tell my experiences as survivors and killers.  Pros:  -Fantastic premise for a game. Four almost defenseless survivors against one bloodthirsty killer. Love it! -It's been quite some time that a game has gotten me this immersed. Like when I'm mere seconds from completeing a goal as a survivor and the killer is coming at me at full speed makes me heart pound. -Getting to slaughter a group of young adults in a brutal fashion is a blast.  Cons:  -Rampant Disconnection. My very first game had the killer disconnect and shut down the match because us survivors were already opening the exits and he hadn't even injured a single one of us. This has happened about a total of three times out of about ten games. I've noticed a few surivors on my team as well disconnect the moment they realize that we couldn't save them. Only about two times for this. From the forums this looks to be a massive loophole that helps save a players useable items and rank. Devs said they have fixed this. -It's not scary. It gets my heart beating from some close calls, but I've never been scared. I'd blame this on the 3rd person view survivors always have. Now, I almost want to give this a pass since this is first and foremost a multiplayer game, survivors need to have 3rd person to survive.  -The maps are kinda randomly made, but not enough to notice any difference. AKA, not something that should be advertised as a feature.  P.S. These are just issues I have noticed. As a killer I never had a survivor make use of a multiple windows to avoid me forever, something a lot of people have brought up. Same goes for Killer perks being useless and survivors being OP.  Now onto my little tales.  As a survivor I've had multiple close calls. Like I mentioned above, opening the gate to escape with only two seconds left until it opens and having the killer be in full site coming at me full speed. These moments are awesome. As are the times you are running for your life, with the killer right behind you. Or even hiding in a cabinet as the killer wanders by, hoping he doesn't decide to search for you. The only survivor I've played as is Dwight.  As for Killers, I've done Trapper and Hillbilly. As Trapper, it is so fun to lay a perfectly hidden trap and then watch a survivor get caught as they try to save their team. Hillbilly... well I sucked as him. Big time. All four survivors got away and I only hooked one and didn't land a single chainsaw attack. Overall you feel super powerful, knowing that the survivors can do barely anything to stop you.   TL:DR: From my experience, this game has been a blast. It's intense as a survivor and brutally fun as a killer. For me the sheer amount of fun I've gotten from my short experience is enough to make me feel safe in my purchase.  ",

            "review_text": "A good, atmospheric yet competitive game where you can either play as a survivor, sneaking and juking your way around the killer and ultimately escaping him altogether, or as a killer himself, bringing down the agony on your victims.  Without doing much in-debt analysis, I'll just list a few pros and cons that I think a new player will likely experience:  Pros:  Atmosphere: for your first hundred or so hours, as long as nothing from reality breaks your immersion, you're very likely going to get immersed in the game and it will feel awesome. Whether you go on a calculated hunt or tense repair mission, you're really going to feel it well. And even if immersion breaks, for example, after a very long playtime of several hundred hours, the tension and gameplay fun remains.  Continuous development: it's not a free-access half-baked game, really, but game grows and new content is being added, including new survivors and killers, balancing patches and much more. I find it a big plus because the game is not stagnant and you're going to see new content (which, so far was not lacking).  Simple, but tricky: relatively simple ruleset for a match in general, yet so many things to master. There are lots of small details during gameplay that can improve you as a player, many different tactical methods to behave in certain situations. Many choices, which have to be done real-time and some options aren't all that obvious. And, because you're constantly playing against real people, your ability to quickly read other people and behave accordingly is also trained well here.  Fun to play with friends: game definetely not requires you playing in a party, but if you got someone with whom you can voice chat and play this game - it's going to be some pretty fun time. If you're a survivor with no friends in lobby, you may not be in the most favorable conditions, but if you're a lone killer then you're definetely doing it right.  Cons: Relatively poor optimisation and possible crashes: although runs relatively good on my very 'mediocre' PC, if you're used to 60 FPS on weak PC then you're going to get disappointed. Some people speak about crashes and stuff, but as long as I unplug my Xbox 360 controller from my PC I am not crashing at all (although if I don't, then, sometimes I actually do crash my game). If you got some good hardware out there and you know how to use it, though, then you're certainly fine with this game.  Salty community: if you're afraid of being judged by random people and you can't properly escape those situations - then beware, because this game attracts many salty individuals who can tell you stuff in post-match chat. It's not a bad side for me, because I simply don't care, but some new people may and for that reason I'm listing it in here.    All in all, I definetely recommend this game, especially for the price it has been listed on Steam. Dead by Daylight gave me a lot of experience and good times, and I'm sure there's much more to come.",

            "review_text": "It's a game with a lot of potential. But you should treat it like a Beta version. It still has a lot of bugs and balancing issues. From glitched out items, to vastly underpowered perks. I myself am rank 1 in both killer and survivor and I can say without any doubt that ranking up with killer is child's play compared to ranking up as a survivor. You really need to mess up as a killer to drop in rank.  Furthermore the grind to level up is very long, also because of perks that are useless. There are some perks so useless that when you would combine two of them, it would still be useless (like 'this is not happening' and 'deja vu'). If you are new to the game, a camping killer will ruin your experience. Unfortunately most of them will be campers at the lower ranks, as its easier and will still reward the killer with points. Also if you're starting to play as a killer you'll be annoyed by people who use infinite loops. But you'll learn how to deal with both cases as you get better.  Then the matchmaking. You'll hear it from everyone but it's true. The matchmaking isn't just bad, it's terrible. If you want to play with friends, prepare to spent at least just as much time playing the game as waiting to finally get into a lobby. And don't expect to do something else in the meantime while you're searching for a lobby as you have to press the 'ready' button every 15 seconds.  In the end it's still a good game, eventhough it still needs a lot of work.",

How would that world look? Disasterous. Just like this game's balance sometimes. There are survivors that will abuse the infinites or unreachable places for the killer -- the tractor and will teabag you right then and there. But when you kill them before they get to their infinite and you carry them to your basement with your forced iron grasp 3 because all your hooks are destroyed, then they will cry to the developers saying that killers need a nerf bla bla bla. I'm saying this as a survivor main all while I have a hypocrite friend which does this very thing. I also play killer a bit and it definitely does happen. When you camp someone that abused infinites, they will always say 'You camper, you ruin dead by daylight bla bla bla -- ' yet they're the one abusing the infinite jukes. I just wish this game didn't have such a toxic and crybaby community. Survivors get upset over everything and anything and then the killers feel the nerfs coming up. I haven't gotten destroyed by ONE nurse with 3 jumps, but of course survivors that didn't know how to counterplay and got destroyed cried all the time until Nurse was nerfed from being good to mediocre.

However there is 1 aspect that can completely ruin the entire game, that is... those killers who put you on a hook and think it's somekind of staring contest..........  Seriously in the 4 hours I've played everytime I got caught I have been camped to death and that's a major let down for me since there is no escape from it that way.  The rest of the game however is great, I truly recommend this game especially since it's still brand new so updates are probably going to put some changes in the game and hopefully find something to get rid of those hook stare down contests.  Pro's  - Smooth gameplay (Steady framerate) - No bugs and glitches. ( At least none that I know of so far) - Lot of variaty (Random generated maps and different tools/ability's) - Every round is more exciting then the last.  Con's - Killers who hook you and just keep standing there untill you die. - No form of communication once you're in-game. ",

            "review_text": "• What is Dead by Daylight? *Updated 12/24/2016* edits * *  o DBD is Horror game focusing on 1 v 4 asymmetrical gameplay Killer vs Survivors. While most horror games today focus too much of its scare factor on jump scares to accomplish its task DBD takes another approach gradually increasing tension. The tension brought on by the sense of your impending demise and the heart beat building intensity, or for killers the sound of completed generators which signals that the amount of time you have left to sacrifice the survivors is almost up. Or sneaky survivors which you have a hard time tracking down. DBD puts 4 survivors against a killer who must repair five generators and work as a team before they scarified by meat hook to the entity.  • The Good:  o I love this game, and would recommend you to give it a try.  o Randomly generated maps and layout o As of 9/28/16 the game IS NOT a jam packed DLC cash cow with micro transactions *Every DLC except for the nurse you would have to pay for*  o Feeling of a 80s horror movie where at any moment the killer could be right over your shoulder.  o The soundtrack and heartbeats as the killer grows nearer always puts you at a state of unease and is spot on (even with ~200 hours in it still feels uneasy) *survivors are no longer scared of the killer bc of their perks*  o Even though Evolve (Original Not Stage 2) and this game focus on asymmetrical gameplay do not compare them; that would not be doing this game justice.  o The problem of unbalanced matchmaking *hasnt been fixed* o Fairly low $20 price tag o Devs seem very passionate about their project so the game should have frequent updates, support, and future content.   • The Bad:  o The Bugs: At launch the game was very buggy but with frequent updates the game feels a bit smoother, but you will encounter some bugs, like all games. *Still many bugs months later*  o The game favors survivors most killers are no longer viable against survivor perks and try hard survive with friends*  o Infinites and campers *the problem now is survivors the meta builds desisive strike / self care / adrenaline / sabotage* makes most veteran survivors unkillable*  o Unsure of the Devs direction on future DLC plans *all payed*  o Getting out of rank 20 hell (~ 16 – 20) can be a nightmare bc of inexperienced survivors o Laggy killers need for dedicated servers *still*  Simply type 1 repeatedly in the lobby chat to test for lag.  o Every perk on both sides should feel as a viable option to match a certain playstyle but this is not the case, some perks such as iron grasps on the killer side are absolutely mandatory while others are a waste of a slot o A few killers use macro bots (depending on your outlook can be a hindrance or a quick way to farm points for both parties).  o Would like to see more emotes or proxy voice communication (restricted to a limited distance for survivors)  o Would like to see an additional game mode / focus on completing a different randomly decided objective rather than generators every game.   • Final Thoughts:  o Don’t let the number of problems that I brought up dissuade you from purchasing the game. The game is amazing and the unique dynamic between killer vs survivors and an altruistic team focused survivor group vs a selfish group that views itself as individuals that hasn’t been matched in any game that I have seen. You can read all the reviews on steam, but until you play it you will never know if a game is right for you. The game does have a few problems but what game doesn’t these days. Once a problem is found the devs usually get taken care of in a timely manner. I would like to see more item diversity on the survivor’s side. As of today I would rate DBD an 8/10 it has a few problems but does several new things for gaming and does them quite well.   • TIPS: Your focus while playing shouldn’t be to kill everyone or simply survive you must entertain the ominous prescience known as the entity in several ways if you wish to rank up, completing objectives surviving, helping teammates etc. If you face camp survivors on the hook not only does it take away from the overall fun for survivors,but you don’t get nearly as many points for chasing the survivors usually results in a derank.  • Learn how to hide, and remain calm, the killer can only see your tracks when you run so use this to your advantage.  • Repairing the generators to 99% and not completing it is a strong option for survivors, killers have more generators to patrol meaning that they are less likely to find you.  • Survivors can now crouch past and crouch next to crows without setting them off. This is a new hiding option for survivors that is quite effective, most killers even the more experienced ones will look for alerted crows to see if a survivor has been in the area and will not walk near them in fear of setting them off themselves.  • At the start of the trail look for a hook first, each killer has their own hook allowing you to identify the killer and lets you prepare a strategy against that killer, also watch you should watch out for.  . Killers also have their own distinct sound grunts, chainsaw, bells, claps of a trap, shrieks etcs to let you know which killer it is.  • Also at the start of the trail try to get a sense of where the killer is before starting a gen, a generator with little to no progress is often an indicator that a survivor is near.  • Learn how to do the quick time skill checks and master getting great skill checks.  o Failing the skill checks not only slows down the time it takes for healing sabotaging a repairing but it also alerts the killer to you location which could compromise a whole team.  • If you are on the fence about purchasing the game I would say go ahead and try it out. I hope the tips that I provided will allow you to get out of survivor hell and rank high in no time.",

It's very easy to die in this game so planning and strategy are hallmarks - Game is unforgiving and not noob friendly, there is a high barrier to entry that must be overcome to 'git gud'  The Bad - Game is unforgiving and not noob friendly, there is a high barrier to entry that must be overcome to 'git gud' - Individualistic teamplay means that teamates will often abandon you if things go south - Killers camping hooks, while a valid strategy, ruins the fun a bit - Queuetimes can be really bad if not enough killers or survivors are playing - Bloodweb leveling feels a bit pointless, a better leveling and perk system might help this game out - Lots of grind to obtain perks, meaning it will be a while before you get to experiment with different builds - Some perks are just terrible compared to others, the perks aren't well balanced  The Ugly - The queue process is terrible. If you don't get into the game, the system will kick you out and make you queue up again. Queue should not have to be entered multiple times, the player should remain in the queue until he or she finds a game. - Easy ways to exploit the blood system in multiplayer - No blood given for playing with friends as the killer. (And while I realize that allowing this would allow some serious exploits, they could have given a seperate bloodpool for offline play so you and your friends can still play together and level up in a different manner.)  Overall, I think this is a great game, but certainly not for everyone. I'd recommend watching some videos before you get it, just to make sure it boasts the type of gameplay you're looking for.

            "review_text": "This game is really fun being both survivor/killer. However it seems that the Killer is host considering they are creating the lobby which leaves half the time if not more, survivors are lagging and at a disadvantage for rubberbanding right back to the killer. The matchmaking is kind of bugged where you'd click join lobby and it'll do nothing but put you back to that same screen prompting you to join lobby, sometimes happens over and over. Can't play with friends in public matches but for obvious reasons, i.e. boosting. However I do think that friends should at least be able to join as survivors. I've also experienced a 10 min loading screen upon entering a match where 3 ended up quitting and left me and the Killer to play. Despite the few cons I seem to have talked about, this game is fairly new so I think putting out those cons, devs may get an idea on the sorts of issues/problems the game has.   Now that the cons are out of the way, let me explain the fun facts: This game pits 4 survivors against 1 killer where you need to activate generators to open gates to escape, the killer is obviously to prevent that from happening. There are 4 different characters for survivor that have special perks that you can purchase via earning credits playing online. Same goes with the Killer but there are only 3 types of Killers which depends on your playstyle. You can also earn items that can help you in the match as well as add on's that are for that particular item. You also earn offerings that you choose before a match that will burn to apply to the match you're about to play, these offerings can be used as an advantage and also help earn you more credits. The ranking system is pretty solid where you level up your character and then you have your survivor/killer rank that you earn by actually doing the objective consistently in each category. That's all I can think of now so I'll stop here.   I give this game a 8/10 for me personally. These bugs aren't exactly gamebreaking besides the lag but that's a norm. With a few patches/updates and possibly better connection between hosts/survivors this game would be less frustrating. All in all, it's an easily enjoyable game for $20.",

As a survivor it's a very intense experience to try to escape and as a killer it is really statisfying if you finally catch the last survivor and hook them.",

But It needs to fix the matchmaking. It cost a lot of time to find a game. it's annoying when you see failed to join the game, or no matches found. You have to press 'join lobby' or 'Ready' after all missed attempt. the second bad think I have to write is, that i think it's stupid to let killer make his own game in matchmaking. Better would be if you will have you own servers on which can people play. My rating for this game is 8/10 because it's funny to play with friends against the killer. But also it's bad when you have rank 20 and you're playing against rank 1 killer with nice perks. So that's it, I hope it will convinces anyone to buy this game.",

Well the catch is that the game suffers from constant pressure of silly kids who take things a little too serious while playing.....there's been bugs of rendering and some minor aspects of loading parts of maps,players get stuck under some rocks and and stuff and i dont get cause i never had any of this things in the amount of hours i had...they had over 30 bug fixes 3 days after release and people complained....They created survive with friends at people demands in 4 weeks and they complained,Infinite loop jukes got cried out they fixed a lot and people complained(20 fk bucks). Well i know the game is not perfect,none really are,the matchmaking is annoying for people,from what i've heard(never waited more then 2 minutes for each game,Ever),the dc's and lack of punishment for both sides,the hilarious part of lack of content(20 fk bucks and peope still cry),the camping part of the killers,Key binding,what's the rest cause i don't remember......

It is incredibly atmospheric, intense, and full of dread. Playing as a survivor or as the killer are both fun, but there is a certain primitive thrill that I get from hunting people down and instilling fear in their souls with the revv of my chainsaw!  Each map, while all having a similar feel and similar props, feels unique and very horror-movie-esque (eg- cornfields, abandoned farms, etc). The game is surprisingly balanced I feel. This game isn't without problems, like matchmaking and the graphics being mediocre, but it doesn't take away from it's charm or the fun.

Well, now you have to make your own decisions in that very situation.  This game is like a Texas Chainsaw Massacre simulator. If you are a horror fan, such as myself, I highly recommend this game. It is incredibly atmospheric, intense, and full of dread. Playing as a survivor or as the killer are both fun, but there is a certain primitive thrill that I get from hunting people down and instilling fear in their souls with the revv of my chainsaw!  Each map, while all having a similar feel and similar props, feels unique and very horror-movie-esque (eg- cornfields, abandoned farms, etc). The game is surprisingly balanced I feel. This game isn't without problems, like matchmaking and the graphics being mediocre, but it doesn't take away from it's charm or the fun.  I recommend this game, definitely worth the price :D Especially for horror fans.",

            "review_text": "TL:DR This game is a bug filled, enjoyable mess which is only worth the full price if you have friends to play with   This is, at the moment, not a very well made game. But it IS hella fun, and that's what it sets out to be. To me, friends are crucial to enjoying this game to its full potential, it's quite fun without them but playing with friends is the real draw here. Some genuinely nailbiting and hilarious experiences come out of this game and it is genuinely just damn good fun.   The reason I say the game is not well made is that at the stage it's at right now, at August 2016, there are so many bugs, exploits, annoying mechanics and mechanics which are simply not used. Lockers are a good example. See anyone play this game even remotely seriously and they will almost never get in a locker. This eliminates an entire game mechanic not due to it being a bad idea, but just terrible execution (heh). The gameplay is at it's core repetivive with differing maps and killers only giving so much variation.   Yet there's something uniquely compelling about this game which keeps me coming back. Even as a high ranked survivor who rarely gets straight out terrified or jumpscared anymore, I have never played a game where I am so consistently on edge, 8/10 games will leave me shaking and my hands sweaty, even if I wouldn't say I was exactly 'scared'. The rush when you manage to outjuke a killer you know is quite good, the tension as you hide in wait to save your dying teammate, knowing if you're spotted its the end for them... it's engaging and compelling in a way I've almost never experienced.",

It's important to remember that this game has only been out for about 2 months as of now and that we need to be a bit more patient.   As for the gameplay, this game is really really really fun, especially when you do manage to queue up together with your friends! Saving that fallen friend whilst the killer is aware of you being premades is a whole lot fun. you get into a situation where the killer is either camping the guy or watching you from afar and is ready to strike. The scary situations really get to you and I can almost guarantee that you will be screaming at one point in the game. It's like a really scary hide and seek where the guy searching (the killer) gets to kill you!   I started off playing this game solo and I managed to find some really good people in here, a lot of people are nice and even tho you cannot communicate with each other (Apart from hand gestures where you point and ask someone to follow you) you can really tell what your teammate is feeling. I do recommend playing with friends as I find it to be way more challenging because you won't me ignoring those teammates in impossible situations etc.",

Best 18-20 bucks I've spent in AWHILE. As a lifelong gamer, I really can say this is a top 10 favorite.  The pros + + The music and sound effects alone make the experience literally get your heart beating faster. Hell, I think it even boosts your metabolism because of how on-edge you can become. + The game looks pretty cool. I like the style of landcape etc. The maps they have now, 3 main areas with smaller sub areas, are incredible as they are now, but there are still updates and new maps in the future. I've played easily over 100 matches, and in 3 maps, I can say with confidence that it has NOT gotten old. I'm really impressed, as being someone who plays everything from Dark Souls to Elder Scrolls to Fallout. + If you are like me and loved hide and seek and tag when you were a kid and also now, you'll love this, because basically this is a 'grown up' version of that game. + The team aspect is excellent. Banding together makes repairing, healing, and basically ensuring your survival a lot easier, and it doesn't feel poorly done or forced. I usually like working alone, but this game really makes the working with others aspect appealing. + The items/loadout works very well. Plenty of offerings to put forward, and the items available are straight to the point. + The stealth aspect and hiding behind objects etc. works nearly flawlessly, and the feeling you get when the killer runs RIGHT BY you is unparalleled. + The multiplayer aspect, plus the ability to play with friends, makes it that much more entertaining.  Negatives - - Several glitches even in the introductory part of the game while you are waiting in the lobby. That one can be overcome, but then there's some really frustrating ones in game, especially if the killer's internet is ♥♥♥♥♥♥, because you rubber band all over, or it's choppy and there's lag delays. - Although I love the 3 maps, I would definitely say more maps would definitely not be out of the question.

So the only option to play with your friend is in a private match which does not give you any bloodpoints or rewards. At its current state the game is still somewhat fun, but it is missing a lot of features like in-game voice communication or proxy voice communication. It is only $18 so it is not a huge price tag and if the developers actively listen and fixes their game then it could be worth it.",

The bugs are pretty hard to come across unless you let them happen(for example there is a bug where your game crashes if you have a controller plugged in and do a channel with keyboard controls) Everything else aside, this game is incredibly fun, even if you are playing alone. If you want to play with friends, there's 'Kill your Friends' for a 5 man private game with no ranking or bloodpoint-gain, although you'll have to wait if you want to queue with them for bloodpoints. Just remember, the top reviews are usually complaining about minor things.",

            "review_text": "First actual review for a game... I have to say this is an amazing game! Ignore the buthurt ones who complain about the game 'not being patched immediately.' It has been out for only ONE month! The Devs are on twitch occasionally announcing whats to come in the next patches, responding to the fans and sharing what they plan to do in the future of the game.. Also posting many announcements and notes on the games official Twitter page. The Devs are people too so take it easy.  All in all i bought this game for a WHOLE $17.99 USD which is NOTHING IMO (A mid/low class income guy) Heres a simple breakdown Its got four survivor choices who all have unique perks you unlock as you level them and greatly benifit you and your team. Three killers (Bound to be more... hopefully soon :D ) with the same setup (unique perks that benefit greatly)... one killer hosts a lobby and waits for four survivors to join and ready their loadout (tools, attachments, offerings, perks etc...) while the killer waits for them to ready up he can see the opposing players classes, levels, ranks and prestige lvl if aquired to know what hes up against and pick his killer accordingly. The survivors however cannot see anything info about the killer aside from his offerings until they encounter him his hooks or his weapon noises in game. Once the game begins the survivors have a goal to repair five of i think eight randomly spawned Generators which power up two randomly spawned escape doors which the survivors use to win/escape.  Now the RANKING SYSTEM: The survivors have four point categories that gather their in game score. 1. Objective - Generators/looting chests/ opening escape doors. 2. Survival - Escaping/ struggling while in the final stage of being on the hook. 3. Altruism - Healing self/allies, saving allies from hooks reuniting with split up allies. 4. Boldness - Running from the killer, escaping the killer, sabotaging killers hooks, stunning killer being a ballsy mother ♥♥♥♥er.  The ranking system requires survivors to gain a minimum of 10k points throughout these categories for one pip and 20k points for 2 pips (pip= level towards next rank). Each category maxes at 5k points towards your rank while the remaining points in the maxed category are just extras for leveling.   For example you need either 5k points in only two categories or 2.5k in each and so on to level atleast once towards the next rank. so essentially you can help teamates, do very few or NO objectives (Pls do objs though), and kite the ♥♥♥♥ out of the killer and end up dying in the end and STILL RANK UP! I strongly disagree that the ranking system is as broken as half the other reviews for this game say.  Anyways im getting to into this review for how little i do this xD. Look up the killer if you're more interested.   I highly suggest you purchase this game.  ...Sincerely a happy customer.",

There is no wrong or right way to play this game but as you get better you realize that this game uses orbital mechanics when hunting and trying to get the generators. Distance of generators and how fast you move determine how well you progress. There are a few glitches and occasional graphics driver crash I have experienced but it rarely happens and overall the bugs are minimal. If the game resets for some reason it means the cloud server is out of sync. Re start the game and you will have all your stuff back, had this happen once or twice but usually it works fine. Would love more content, and possibly bigger teams in the future. The game really keeps you on your toes, you have to pay attention to your environment and focus. The higher you are ranked the more challenging the game becomes. Match making is decent but could use improvement. If you want tutorials go watch twich streamers for some great tips and see what makes a great killer / survivor. Whats also fascinating is how movement plays a huge role. Move fast as a survivor, running around like a maniac and you will get spotted and most likely caught by the killer. If you are the killer and slow to defend your turf, the 4 players will quickly grind down their generators and you are going to lose. Move fast as the killer and slow and steady as a survivor. You work faster as a team, not by running around by yourself and remember to have fun! Looking forward to more updates and new content!",

Although, if you like doing either of those things in the company of friends... well you better have atleast 4 other friends with 20 bucks in their pockets.  TLDR: Good game, would recomend if you like to play solo  The week leading up to the launch of this title, I was very excited. Watching a multitude of streamers play this game with their friends made me wish I could do the same. The hype was real. When the game went live a friend of mine and I bought this game anxious to cower in fear at the likes of machette clad macocists. We then spent about 20 minutes trying to figure out how to play together. Surely there was an 'invite a friend' option we were over looking. After hosting and rehosting lobbies we discovered no such option exsists... What a let down! Dead By Daylight seems like the perfect platform to have a real horror shared-experience with friends but the only way to accomplish this is in a private game. To me, this seems like a huge over sight.   Now, understandably, I can see the developers side of this decision. Sure, playing this game as a survivor with a friend could lead to some already unbalanced game play, however I think that the whole soul of this game revolves around surviving as a group and what better way to experience that than with a friend. In my opinion if the developers were worried about competetive balance, they should have just made the match making system allow friends and then work on developing a more competetive game mode in the future.  Rant aside, let's talk about the game. Overall i really enjoy the game. The ambianceis perfect. The maps are creepy, the character modles are pretty terrifying and the mechanics are pretty solid. The feeling you get as a survivor being chased through a cornfield by a psycotic chainsaw massacre-ist is second to none. Likewise, hunting survivors as a nearly invisible wraith is awesome. Sure there are some balance issues that are being addressed, that is fine. I am happy that the developers are quick to patch this title.  Dead By Daylight is certainly worth the money with one caveat: I hope you like playing by yourself! I, however, do not and will probably not be playing this game too much until i can actually match make with my friends or somehow convince more of my friends to make the purchase.",

Most of the problems people have are just them not being that good, even the perks that most higher levels have don't affect the game that much. I as a killer have been capable of killing someone who has four perks, while I have none. As a survivor I've been able to escape a killer with four perks while I only had a perk for chest detection. There really isn't any balancing issues in my opinion, but there is one big problem I'm having. In the FOUR hours I've played this game, I have crashed SEVEN times. I'm averaging almost two crashes on hour. It's probably just something to do with some kind of file, in the wrong spot, or missing one steam can't seem to catch with Cache Validation, but it's almost unplayable for me. Despite the constant crashing, I WANT MORE. Killing, Running, Hiding, Fixing, Trapping, Chasing. It's all so satisfying, nothing is greater than chasing that one annoying survivor who has saved everyone, or fixed four generators already. Or juking the killer as the last survivor and spending ten minutes skulking about before you drop through the trap door, It's a very fun game and I reccomend it, I just hope you have better luck with the crashing.",

If you want a game that allows you to murder all of your friends while also making creepy voices and acting like a crazed maniac then this game is right for you. Horror games dont really phase me that much, this game can be the few that can actually make me feel alive and terrified.   P.S DEVS +Please add some more ways to kill the survivors, And or the whole survivors tricking the murderer to die or leave the grounds.  +Please add a mic system or some way to chat to your fellow survivors, maybe like notes you pass around or something like a secret chat.

Dead by Daylight is a very fun game to play, solo or otherwise. The pure adrenaline of running away from the killer is something quite extraordinary. Learning all the different ways to juke the killer is something to behold as it will take hours to get right. But once you do, it's incredibly satisfying.  The current gripe the community has with the game (v1.2.1) is that the new killer, Michael Myers, is incredibly OP. This is not the case. He came out approximately 15 hours before posting this review and already the community is whining about the new killer.   If there's anything to take from that is that the community for this game can sometimes be sub-par due to them being really picky about how the game plays and are impatient about learning how to play against a killer who changes the way you play just a bit.  Another gripe the community has is that the  Halloween  DLC makes the game Play to Win. Once again, this is not the case. Yes, the DLC is $7 and includes a killer and survivor. But that doesn't mean you have to pay to get them. You can unlock the killer and survivor in game, but you cannot level them up. Yes it does suck that it's behind a paywall to get any big use out of them but that isn't pay to win, it's just inconvinient.   Overall, Dead by Daylight is an incredibly fun game that can keep you entertained for hours with its 'one more game' mentality. I highly recommend at least giving it a try, regardless of what the community says.",

            "review_text": "I RECOMMEND THIS GAME COMPLETELY - BUT PLEASE READ  Pros  It's a fun game, not so much as scary but tense. You can choose to save or abandon people which is kinda great, it brings out the monster in all of us lol. Each map has random generator spawns which can give advantage to the player, and you can also be awarded 'Offerings' which can be used to alter the map and it's surroundings to either help the Killer or the player.   Cons  There is no party system yet(although I hear it is their top priority), so you can either go solo for a while until this comes out, or you can try and join the same game as your friends(easy but can take a anywhere between 1-15 mins). ALTHOUGH you CAN play a private match with your friends however no XP is rewarded, as can be expected. Also the Killers are great, however I don't like the idea of the wraith, the fact that he can go invisible is kinda OP(however the player is alerted when he goes invisible by a bell tolling and he cannot interact or attack when invisible, which kinda makes up for it) but overall I think the character itself is a little OP. Also - and I think alot of people would agree, when you are hung up on a hook, most killers, if not ALL, will just camp the hook, which in my opinion is kinda bad because it's basically setting you up for a GG, although when the killer camps the hook it allows for everyone else to fix generators and escape, thus making a 'loss' on the killers part.   Overall  Is a great game and is worth its money, you could play hours on end without getting bored as each map variant offers great advantages and disadvantages to killer and player alike - You will NEVER always win at this game, teamwork is KEY, however you could pull a sneaky Shane on Otis from TWD and escape alone :D. However a small tweaking for friends to connect and play with each other is much needed, and personally I feel the Wraith Killer could be minorly tweaked.",

Add more hiding places like hiding in the box. 2.Add killer have a gun. Killer don't have to use melee weapon to kill survivors. Ok sounds overpowered but it's annoying survivors going some places the killer have bad time to catch them. So i recommend having the gun then survivor gets terrified. 3. Add survivor/perk can punch to stun the killer. 4. Add a perk killer can break the walls. Survivors will get jumpscared by the killer. Like fixing generator and hear the heartbeat and they don't know which way he's coming. And suddenly BOOM the The killer breaks the wall. Scary little bit. 5. Survivors can pass through between broken wall. Yes, I am talking about 4th one, survivor have more access to escape form the killer. That's all recommend everyone play this game and developers GREAT JOB!!! :)",

Crows will circle the survivors overhead if they stay in the same spot for a long time, or land near the metal closet if a survivor stays inside for too long.

The leavers in games to provent others from getting points. The fact you can sometimes see a survivors arm through a cupboard. Easy Fix Thats pretty much it for now.  Thank you for reading overall AMAZING GAME! Thank you for making it  ",

First im going to go through with the cons and then pros, and after some other things.  Cons -Extremely buggy and glitchy. -No way to communicate as a survivor, at all (no voice chat, text chat etc, only way to communicate is that you go to ts, skype etc. -No group search sytem yet (Devs confirmed that they are making this but its not in the game yet). -I feel that the game is unbalanced for the survivors. -Bad optimization  Pros *Good graphics. *Private match system is alot of fun to play with friends. *Even though i feel that the game is unbalanced for the survivors its still a blast playing as one. *Scary and good athmosphere.  The game is awfully bugged (game says steam goes offline even tho it doesnt, you can get stuck when picking up a survivor as the killer for the rest of the game this includes the survivor also gettign stuck which means the match cant end unless you leave, a annoying bug that makes it so that nobody else can/will(?) join your lobby (not private macth) and a bunch of other bugs).   This game feels like it is an early access game even though it isn't. I will give this game a 6/10 and i recommend buying this game once the bugs and glitches (most of them) are fixed.   EDIT Section. 17/06/2016 - Changed rating from 5/10 to 6/10 due to game getting more stable since lauch day with more and more players. Removed/edited a few sections (removed section that included killer camping by the hook and edited the bugs/glitches section). Changed recommendation from 'I do not recommend this game' to 'I recommend this game'",

            "review_text": "this game, played well, plays like a horror movie feels. It's a solid game where the tension is enormous for survivors and the worst part of sadism blooms for the killers. 10/10. Very Active Developers, Weekly streams explaining what's going on in the office and a steady stream of updates mean this game is getting stronger all the time.  Pros: Intense 4v1 action where the constant fear of a remorseless killer pushes to you do everything in your power to escape, genious point system that incentivises the gameplay style that makes the game the most engaging it can be. wide variety of killers and maps keeps the game interesting.  Cons: there are bugs and exploits that can make the game difficult or frustrating for both the killers and survviors. there's only 1 game mode with only 1 real set of objectives meaning there can be a degree of monotony to playing after a while. Matchmaking is based on rank, some high skill people abuse game leaver penalty to lower their rank artifically to face less skilled opponents, the game is fairly grindy overall requireing a large time investment to each character individually for them to be powerful.  Overall Pros outshine cons and the game is both strong and engaging for long term play. quite a fun romp that i heartily recommend.",

If you ever think that this would be a problem, chill and buy the game. At moment of writing this review, one of the killers, Michael Myers, is too overpowered and he induce the fear in the minds of the survivors. After getting used to play as survivor, you still feel a tingling in your stomach when your heart starts to beat like a drum. As a killer is still annoying to get blocked by the survivors that don't 'fear the killer' and don't assume the role. For 19.99€, it worth it if you want to experience a really good horror multiplayer survial.",

Kinda uniqe game where there are 4 survivors vs 1 killer i really love to play the survivors and the killer it gives a certain feeling from both in the gameplay. I really liked how the Devs diaries was so accurate towards the game, it showed that they really care about their creation that is Dead by daylight. The feeling when you escape or when you caught the last survivor and hook him...it feels amazing (personally when i caught someone i start the music 'Hooked on a feeling' cuz a badass killer need badass music)  Pros: You can hunt 4 victims, you have to think before you act as a survivor, gameplay is sweet and the heartbeat is epic! Helping fellow survivors gives you more points and bigger chance to survive but also a penalty if you get caught by the killer!, can be 4 different survivors and 3 different killers. EPIC chases and escapes. Have no DLC wich i hope they never get!  Cons: Can only play with friends in private, if not you are lucky to find them in a solo queue. Killers tend to camp after they hooked 1 survivor, some bugs that break the game so that if not you or the killer leave the game goes on forever and the one who leaves loses points.  I really do hope that the devs fixes so you can play with friends in a public game and that they give us some different customisations for blood points or something, overall the game is awesome and i recomend it 100% but i would not buy it for 19,99 Euro it's worth 15,99 thats for sure but not higher.",

As much as i like this game and the concept and overall would recommend the game i cannot recommend it because  The Lobby crashes more than it connects... sometimes you get connected... sometimes you need to click 'join lobby' approx. steady for 2 mins (25 -30 times) to even get INTO a lobby and then theres the chance that you crash before the game starts. Yes ... the ppl leaving the lobby all the time are not noobs, who dont know what they do. They simply crash. I have the game on 2 PCs and 5 friends have it i talked to them.  I have even had 2 complete PC Crashes after the intro (same crash) and had to run a diag. This never happened with any of the 200+ products i have on steam. I have no virtual devices or hamachi, a standard bought PC no overclocking, no ♥♥♥♥.   As long as the technical issues prevail i cannot recommend. As soon as the lobby is stable and the crashes stop i will recommend. Because the game itself if big fun. But the Lobby is a pain. And as they changed the game after i bought it and now its more unstable product after a technical change from the developers, not ordered by me warranty would apply  (actually the steam refund 2hrs would apply new after every patch. Its a legal thing. If you change a product you change the contract conditions and we all know you cannot change a contract one-sided) I work in a Firm specialized on technical documentation and product warranty. If they say software only a license, well a license is nothing but a long running contract. But i digress  Do not buy the game until the lobby is fixed.",

The only problem I'm seeing is a few minor glitches and some connectivity issues. Sometimes the game can get really laggy, but what I can suggest to the devs is to limit the pings of the killer-survivors during the matchmaking process. For us players, you can avoid experiencing a laggy game by using the lobby chat, if your text appears slow, you'll know your host is bad/far away from you, and simply find another lobby to join till your text appears instantly the moment you hit 'Enter'.  Other times I'll glitch though boxes/walls and get stuck till the killer finds me. Throwing down the wooden pallets can get buggy too at times when I end up on the other side even though I clearly did not mean to. These are just two of the many remaining bugs which are yet to be fixed.  BUT, the game works fine 90% of the time, and I enjoyed the game while playing.

Pros: Perfect Atmosphere Balanced despite being a 1v4 (survivors have to work together and cooperate if the monster is even half-way decent) Pants ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ moments are plentiful Skype calls will rarely be as tense and funny at the same time Cons: No rebindable keys Matchmaking doesn't allow for parties so you're either with 4 randoms, or have to play only with friends Occasional d/cs seem to happen 1 out 5 games (but will most likely become much less common as patches come out) EDIT: As I've played more games it's dropped to about 1 in 10 so still a noticeable annoyance but less common Overall: This is a great game especially if you convince a few friends to grab it as well. Public matches are either pub stomps by the monster or nerve rackingly close as most monsters I've played against while a survivor are actually not terrible. While the party system (or lack thereof) may seem annoying its not too bad and in either case a close match that you win feels very well earned and desperately fought for.",

My regular weapon was actually more effective at catching and killing the survivors than my special one. So, it isn't bad that's possibly my only complaint. I found the sound to be fitting and the challenge okay. At times it was quite apparent when I was dealing with a survivor who had clearly been playing the game a lot more than me. More often than not they managed to escape with all four survivors or at least 3 of them. I really wish that matchmaking was a bit better.   The other thing I didn't like was that I couldn't do matchmaking with my friends, although I suppose I understand why they didn't allow this was because if all the survivors were on skype it would put them at a huge advantage. So, I don't get why there isn't a feature for in game chat that people can hear if they are close to you.",

            "review_text": "  Thoughts from the Free Weekend:  I've had this on my wishlist for a while - I've liked the 4v1 style of games for a while, and this caught my interest. How exactly would you survive against an unstoppable serial killer? Turns out, not too great, but I'm a first-rate psychopath. Go figure. There were a few problems with the game that made it hard to get right now: First, the matchmaking issue - yeah, I know. It was addressed pretty quickly, but to go into a free weekend with a bug like that is a little unproffessional. I also had a real issue with how the matchmaking could be a complete crapshoot - sometimes, you'd have a match against 4 complete newbs like myself, the next you'd be pitted against level 40-somethings with full rare perks. IN those cases, you kinda feel like you have to resort to camping the hooks to make sure you get them, which feels more than a bit unsporting. My other big gripe of the weekend was the fact that the new DLC - with the Nurse and the new survivor - weren't open to weekenders. While I can't say the Nurse would've appealed ( I was more Trapper than anything else), it would've been handy to have a few games as her to work out how she works. Every time i decided to dip a toe into the survivors team, someone playing Nurse managed to get me on a hook within a few minutes. If I knew how her damn teleport worked, it might've helped. A few minor glitches and bugs - at one point, I took a swing at a player and ended up teleported across the map. There's also the tendency for some to just constantly hurdle over the same damn barricade - mebbe a fatigue thing could be brought in to slow them down if it's done too frequently? In its current state, I think the game needs a lot of work. The basic idea is fantastic, and once matches get going they can get pretty tense, even if playing the killer - trying to second guess your victims moves, figure out where they are and scare the everloving crap out of them, is pretty fun. As it is, it's staying on the wishlist - I'll come back to it further down the line, and see how it improves.",

I told him to download Dead by Daylight, so he did. Once we both started the game up, we had issues. We could not find a game, and it was impossible to find one. After 10 minutes, he just gave up. I tried right after he left, it worked again. I played 3 games after that. 2 of the 3 I escaped successfully. To be honest, this game has its ups and downs, but for $20 I think it is totally worth it. If you are not into the horror scene, this is a great starter introduction. For the gameplay, it is VERY good. It is very well enjoyable if you are alone, or if you have a full party of 5. The idea is unique and fun. Both sides- survivor and killer- are relatively equal.

Many people complain about the game's balance, but those are usually from low level (noob) players who unfortunately have been pitted against a high level/rank player. This is due to matchmaking which is not (yet) perfect. You'll win some, you'll lose some. Some folks just get so aggravated when they lose, that they lose their minds and complain to the devs.  Those that complain that the killer is overpowered probably have never watched a horror/slasher film before, which is obviously what this game is inspired by. The killers in those movies could be considered overpowered too, so keeping that theme is spot on. BUT it doesn't mean that the survivors don't stand a chance. It just means that they need to play smarter, using the environment to their advantage.  So does the game have flaws that need to be addressed? Sure, but I'm talking about glitches, bugs, and matchmaking. Not game balancing, which isn't particularly a problem.",

The game has only been out for a short amount of time though, so only expect it to constantly update and get better.  that being said: pros   A ton of progression, you'll likely spend a significant amount of time unlocking perks   Stressful and a high chance of panic. At first it's very scary and tense, and now after 70 hours. it's less scary but still tense.   I've enjoyed all 70 hours.   that feeling of friendship when an ally saves you from a killers grasp.   that feeling of heroism upon saving an ally.   An great sense of pride if you play well. I once completely hid right under a killers nose. Then got away afterwards.   cosmetics, to look spunky.   great time with friends.   it's not without it's faults though.  cons:    the queue times can be a mess, but they've stated that they're looking into them.   I've been matched with an amazing killer, and terrible teammates. Making the chances of winning very small.   Vice versa, terrible killer, amazing teammates. takes away the tense feeling of avoiding the killer.   the progression system can take a LONG time. You'll get a bunch of worthless perks, then get good ones.   The Nurse. When you first fight one she's op. Then you learn to juke.   no mouth animations. Really just a lack of polished animations. Imagine screaming into the night with your mouth closed.   After a long time. The game becomes less scary. Almost no scare factor period.   Made by the people of PAYDAY 2. So there's going to be a crap load of paid DLC.   I rate a solid 7/10. I'm going to keep playing. I'll buy the DLC if I have to.

High replayability, given it's competitive multiplayer. However, both survivor and killer can be frustrating to play. This is *for the most part* because of a mix of bugs/exploits (see the pages of random reports on the community discussions page for specifics) that can ruin a game often enough to be annoying. The reason this does not make this review negative is because I find the game fun to play!   The devs are hardworking and listen to their community and are actively fixing the game's problems. When the game works right, it works extremely well. When it doesn't, it's either very frustrating or very humorous. So, if you enjoy 4v1 multiplayer within a horror environment and are willing to support the devs through a somewhat-rocky launch, by all means, pick this game up and join the mass murdering fun! Many people are posting negative reveiws about this game because of numerous nitpicky complaints that really don't affect gameplay often enough to ruin the experience.   As an example, at the very beginning of the game's launch many people posted negatives because friend-to-friend multiplayer wasn't exsistent. This was a bad move by the devs, but it was deliberate. It was deliberate because it would shift the balance of the game towards the well-coordinated teams. Though the devs openly said this, the community didn't care. So, it was implemented early with barebones funcionality because of the community's impatience. Now what do the reviews say? That it's broken and makes it too hard for killers to play. See a problem there? Again, I will repeat, if you like this genre of game and are even slightly interested and don't mind the once-in-a-while bug that are indeed being fixed as this review is being written: don't be turned away by some of the whiny negatives, this game is worth it!",

This game has a lot of potenial in being a really great game but it also has a lot of flaws that make people rage quit/don't want to get the game in the first place.

But it feels like once you get caught you pretty much dead, because the Killer will just stand there and wait for you to die. Even though the Killer pretty much ruins his chance of getting more kills because of the time wasting on the person who he hung. It still ruins the fun in a match. Especially in the first 2 minutes of the game. Rage quitters are also a problem in this game. Wish they could have a punish system involved when people do, even though I do it sometimes aswell.

I then ventured into the boots of the evil wraith and jumpscared many with my predator style invisibility tricks. The only downside was the weak damage of my sharpened bone club and the pallettes the survivors kept dropping on me. I eventualy got better and avoided those and went around the path to get survivors eventually somehow injuring one gravely survivor to sacrifice her without doing it myself. Got another runner on a meathook, cloaked and then watched as some girl helped him off and they waltzed into the sunset. This game is intense has a great progression system and also is a game where you can improve your skill at it just by playing it. On a side note however this game has issues with GTX 970 cards (you probably know about the 500MB running slower) I get about 24-30 FPS in game but its smooth so I don't care. I did actually do what someone suggested and use DDU to uninstall the nvidia drivers and do a clean install but that did not work. If you have a GTX 970 don't worry make sure the game is set to high for a bit more FPS but you will get a smooth experience out of it. Unfortunately I won't get to be on my pc for a week so I can't progress further but I will not give up on this game. It is ground-breaking in the gameplay department and also choc full of horror and horros movie vibes.

Well sexy one let me tell you...while you are trying to ready up multiple times for a lobby for it to say searching for a game for about 3-8 minutes only to cancel out and have to reready up (god forbid one of your heathen friends goes for a drink or a pee pee time because then you have to wait longer for him to come ready up as well) all of the survivors are just standing around this campfire waiting for a lobby to get into so they can take a knife to the face and run around boo hoo'ing and leaving a blood trail all the way up to a closet you think you're safe in.  You want to play a killer! Well all be dang gum you just broke the game, you'll get into gameplay instantly and frequently. Me personally I like playing as a survivor as I have more fun that way, but it's come down to me and my buddy just playing as survivors in different games now. He has to listen to me talk about my game and all the fun and good times I am having and vice versa. It's ruining our friendship, our bonding time and who we are as men. We will never be the same after this! I left him on a hook one time because I was so used to playing with random people--ya imagine having to deal with that in teamspeak he didn't talk to me for like 15 minutes!  But for real when myself, kurk and tyler was all playing trying to play as three...in 2 and a half hours we got into 2 games...not kidding or being over dramatic at all...literally 2 games in close to 3 hours.   On the brightside we got to know each other very well, kurk is a real life friend and tyler is a buddy I've been gaming with for almost 7 years now. I found out tonight he is 6'6' (holy sh!! I know!) we talked about beer, woman, politics, the universe, who would have what superpower if we got struck by lightening, who's dad could beat up who's dad, what kind of food we ate in the last 3 months...  10/10 would play campfire simulator again and again",

            "review_text": "First, the Game is amazing. It forces you to choose and f*cks you for choosing wrong, like trying to save a person just to get stuck in a trap and see the guy run away and leaving you behind to fill his place. SCREW THAT GUY, IF YOU ARE THAT GUY SCREW YOU. Besides that, the Action/Consequence... Mind? in this game is amazing. Few things need to change, quickly. Like the perks, REMOVE THE TEACHABLE PERKS, At some point the characters becames just cosmedic, which is stupid cuz an athlete can 'teach' someone to run fast for a couple seconds. After you get all the perks for all characters, you almost always choose the same 3 (self-care, saboteur, and Sprint burst (sometimes premonition or spinechill)) So whats the difference between Meg, Jake, Claudette, Nea and the last picked for the team at school guy. Like, you can play Dwight, DWIGHT, F*CKING DWIGHT and win. Just cuz you have all the perks and Dwight is actually Jake in a ret*rd costume. Get rid of that or a better Idea, BUFF THE OTHER PERKS. The box perk is amazing... for the first time you play the game, after that, you know where the boxes spawns and it becomes useless. Leave as it is at level one and at level 2 it increases your chances to get a better item, And at level 3, it the items comes with add-ons. Bunch of other perks need a change. Don`t nerf what`s working like Riot, Buff what is not. The killer, After a few rounds it not scary anymore. Remove the red light from his face so people can be caught by surprise. They need to keep an eye on the killer, isn't that the reason that you have detection perks? So people can know that the killer is coming? Then what's the reason that they need the red light? The survivors, If you don't change the perks, change the basic stats. Like the sprint speed, why can't meg run faster the claudette? she can run faster for a few seconds then she is back at the crawling, and why does Jake can't fix the generator faster the Dwight? Put jake to fix things faster, Meg to run faster (a bit faster then the nurse so that she needs to blink to catch up), Claudette to heal herself and other faster, and Dwight to be the most rounded character, Nea... she can be a more aggresive character, like wiggle out faster, more chance to escape hooks, stuns last longer etc but she is slower at everything OR GET THE ITEMS TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE AT SOME CHARACTERS. Toolboxes should be more effective for Jake not cuz someone can break a post with a hook at the end by his on hand that he knows how to use a screwdriver. Fix the flashlight, Let us blind the killer even if the turns around. It already lasts very little and its almost impossible to blind the killer even if he is looking right at it, we add the fact that he can turn around and negate that complitly. The map, I like it, But add a add-on so you can mark the hooks. And the skeleton key, one of the most useless items and it is super rare, if you go for the hatch as soon as it apears, you don't pip and lose the round, the add-ons consumes the charges so quickly and are almost useless exept the one that allows you to see the killer through the walls, That could be usefull if IT LASTED FOR 5 SECONDS and if it could see the wraith while invis.  And for last, One thing that almost everyone is complaning, The killer, does not have to kill. THE KILLER, KILLER can be a pacifist and just scare people so they run from him. Fix that. And since you heard my suggestions. get hooks on the corner of the map so people don‘t run to the corner to keep the killer there since they can‘t escape him, people just breaks the hooks on one corner of the map and run to the corner. Get one hook in every corner and that either can‘t be destroyed or takes more time to do. And maybe respawn after some time or a after an event, like a generator getting done or the exits getting powered ot the hatch opening etc. The rest IS AMAZING, Good job with the game. Ah , the the ranks. get rewards for player with high ranks, like cheaper bloodwebs or free items for a some time, or even a new kind of money/points that can only be aquired by piping and with that point you buy items outside the bloodweb, so luck isn‘t involved.  tl;dr ♥♥♥♥ you, do you know how long I had to think to right the most clear review possible so dumb people don‘ get confused and think that I praise hitler for some reason. Do you really think that a text that size can be redused to a single sentence? Screw you and vai tomar no cu.  Sorry for bad english, Too lazy to look in the D*ck-cionary.

I would like to give negative feedback for a certain reason (Hunters camping hooks) but it is not a part of the game itaself but a part of those players' playing style so I won't complain about it.

The leveling system has way to many negative effects that de-rank you if you only escape, the killer leaves the match, victims leaving the match, and abruptly force kicking you from game for no reason at all. This game is great and has such potential but if you plan on leveling goooooodddd luckkkk. I noticed an exploit where players who have a significant lvl will force quit the games client in order to avoid deranking which in turn screws everyone else over. You shouldn't lose all your items/perks/gains whatever when a Killer leaves the match. There needs to be a join friends option as well! It's 2016 there should be a join friends feature! My girlfriend suggested that you change up your theme music as well. All you need to do is fix these rank issues and all will be well. Overall I love this game but if these problems are not addressed then you might as well kill your game now developers. I want to recommend this game but I wouldn't purchase it until they figure their ♥♥♥♥ out. Ill change my review to RECOMMEND only once these problems are fixed.",

Sure it's a personal review but if the game is not letting me actually play it what's the point of me giving it an actual positive review, the game was less buggy in the beta version what the hell were they testing during the beta. Which survivor has the bigger boobs?  I change the review when you fix up this game starbreeze, AT the moment I can't join games as a survivor and ANYONE who joins my game when I'm a killer gets insta booted. This is not on, you shouldn't of dumped a pile of crap and threaded it up with thin threads, I rather have one or two killers on stable release across 8 maps than 32 maps with 3 killers 4 survivors and with lots of bugs that can be expolited.",

Graphics: 8/10 = Looks pretty damn good, not the most amazing in the world, but overall better than a lot from other indie companies.  Gameplay: 9/10 and 2/10 =   ~~9/10) This requires some explaining. Most matches are fun, mostly fair and pretty intense, but you usually do not feel cheated. Sometimes you're team fails you and just leaves you to die, sometimes you do the same...which is all fine and good.   ~~2/10) The matches that aren't good are...really really bad. You either end up with the wraith as the killer and it plays some intense levels of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and is extremely OP; wouldn't be so bad if they either nerfed the Wraith's invisibility power, made it take longer to attack after appearing or turned off collision with the Wraith (there have been times where I have been squeezed between a generator and the Wraith when it decides to appear right next to me and I cannot flee). The Other thing that makes some matches absolute horrible is...killers that puppy guard when you're on the hook. I get that it is a tactic, but it should be a tactic they are punished for. Losing points, etc etc, because puppy guarding definitely does not please the 'Entity' if hiding survivors annoy it (An update made it that if you hide too long, the 'Entity' does things to reveal your location).  ~~~~Basically, this poor portion of the review would be negated if they punished killers for Guarding people on the hooks, thus negating a large portion of the Alturism tree of points for survivors. And if the Wraith recieved a major nerf on it's invisibility options. The Hillbilly can run into walls and miss entirely with the chainsaw, the Trapper's traps can be sabotaged, but nothing can ♥♥♥♥ with the Wraith.  Overall 9/10 IF they fix some of the problems in the future.  Suggestions: Nerf the Wraith, Punish Puppy Guarding Killers with point loss or something. Or best idea of all, implement a ban system like similar games have done, where the other players can disallow specific Killers/Monsters, that way newer players are not being absolutely destroyed by the Wraith. Also, please for the love of all that is right, make it easier to get off the hooks...in my whole time playing in the beta and the official, I never once managed to get off the hook with my own power.",

Whether playing as killer or survivor, the game doesn't feel one-sided. While the survivors have the advantage early due to numbers, as the match goes on, surviving becomes much more difficult as you become a target. The only problems I found with the game are perks and skill-based match-making. Perks are either obtained by leveling your charecter, or drops, starting the game with none, a new player is possibly at a disadvantage based on luck, though I feel perks don't usually determine a match. As with skill-based match-making, there is none. A new player can be easily intimidated by a level-20 hunter, as players are thrown in a first come first served basis. Other than that, the game feels very balanced, and makes a great time either playing with randoms or friends.",

I first played it today as a survivor on quick play and my hand was forced to cast lots with a useless not teamworking group. Got killed by the hillbilly very quickly! I then ventured into the boots of the evil wraith and jumpscared many with my predator style invisibility tricks. The only downside was the weak damage of my sharpened bone club and the pallettes the survivors kept dropping on me. I eventualy got better and avoided those and went around the path to get survivors eventually somehow injuring one gravely survivor to sacrifice her without doing it myself. Got another runner on a meathook, cloaked and then watched as some girl helped him off and they waltzed into the sunset. This game is intense has a great progression system and also is a game where you can improve your skill at it just by playing it. On a side note however this game has issues with GTX 970 cards (you probably know about the 500MB running slower) I get about 24-30 FPS in game but its smooth so I don't care. I did actually do what someone suggested and use DDU to uninstall the nvidia drivers and do a clean install but that did not work. If you have a GTX 970 don't worry make sure the game is set to high for a bit more FPS but you will get a smooth experience out of it. Unfortunately I won't get to be on my pc for a week so I can't progress further but I will not give up on this game. It is ground-breaking in the gameplay department and also choc full of horror and horros movie vibes. If you play this you probably will get scared and feel the atmosphere and claustrophobic enviroment working against you.

            "review_text": "A very good game concept. Game mechanics are balanced overall. A great game to play with friends. However the game isn't really ready from my point of view. There are a lot of bugs that ruin gameplay such as, attempting to attack a survivor who is repairing a generator and instead glitching outside the map, getting stuck in a barricade ect. Additionally the ranking system takes place in any and all games you play. So any glitches will have an impact on your rank. Also, since the ranking system is active in every game you play, you can't play a 'casual game' unless you don't care about online rank. It's worth noting that the killer can see the infomation of the survivors, and the surivors can't see any infomation on the killer (I personally like this mechanic because it creates more terror, as the survivors don't know anything about the killer but the killer knows a lot about the survivors). The only problem with this is that Killers (game hosts) aren't punished for jumping matches. People often do this if they think they might lose the game. The game can take a while to pick up because the tutorial system is limited to 6 short videos. A single player option, and the option to play in either a ranked match or a casual one would improve the game. The matching making is not good enough. It can be very difficult to get into a game partly due to the reason stated 5 lines above. Overall I would say that the game is a brilliant concept, with a brilliant atmosphere, but many interface flaws. Only buy if you are prepared to deal with these issues",

The game is fairly fun, and doesn't get old very quickly. ALTHOUGH, the game is very much in the killers favor, after dishing hours into the game as survivor and killer, playing killer is much easier, ESPECIALLY when you get perks that reduce wiggling, increase movement speed, and even seeing injured survivors through walls. The game is VERY MUCH in favor of the killer. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --IF YOU DO BUY THE GAME, you either die to a rank 1 wraith with full perks, or live long enough to see yourself become one.

If you want a good co-op horror game, or just a casual game for you and four other buddies to play, I'd for sure recommend it.",

The developers have put forth a very good effort to fix anything wrong with the game and do a weekly stream to keep the community updated with what's going on in the development process.  My only realy complaint with this game is the matchmaking. Whenever I play killer, almost all of my games are against low ranks while I'm much higher. IE: Lobby of rank 17s or lower while I'm sitting at rank 10. Playing survivor isn't much better either. I generally get put with maybe one other person at my rank and the other two are right around rank 20, as is the killer.  For context, the ranking in this game is reversed to how one may think. You start at rank 20 and work your way down with rank 1 being the highest rank.  Another thing to note is Survive With Friends. This game mode is still in an early stage and finding matches while in a party can take a horribly long time. Some people may choose to not buy/play this game without others, but it's actually a lot of fun working with random people to escape the killer. Once the developers fix the system or at least add in a proper queue it will be much better.  If the developers could fix the matchmaking I wouldn't have any real issues with the game, aside from the occasional bug that shows up now and again. All that said, I highly recommend this game.

He could be around any corner you turn or stalking you from the shadows, you have no idea. You always have a little voice at the back or you're head telling you to look behind you, hid behind that bush or run away. Playing with others can be difficult, and some killers camp your soon to be dead body when they hang you on the hook, but it just adds to the tension that the game pushes for.

The game is now very enjoyable, and most complaints I had in my review below have been dealt with. Pretty sweet game now.    EDITED: OLD REVIEW, NOT LONGER CURRENT OPINION. Great concept of a game, but it's nothing new nor has it been QA'ed properly. Game crashed frequently for me ruining some fun games I actually did have while learning. Some random small bugs but nothing game breaking, bigger problem was connection problems making game pretty laggy at times. Damned, a game with a very very similar concept and gameplay, also suffered connection issues, but never crashed for me and was much more spoopy. This game is definitely horror themed but is more frantic/thriller rather than horror. To compare in movies, Damned is The Ring, and Dead by Daylight is Texas Chainsaw Massacre.   Final Verdict: Fun game during the times it did not crash for me but barely got to finish most games because of those crashes. Sure, i could look up solutions, but i shouldn't need to do that for something i'm purchasing. Not worth the money so I refunded it. Purchase Damned instead for this sort of game, which has little bugs, no crashes, custom lobbies to play with your friends without a need to dodge queues constantly, and much more spoopy gameplay with the same concept, get objectives and escape the area.",

A survivor can sacrifice their teamate to save themselves, or risk their own life to help the teamate and gain more points. Killers can stay near the body on the hook, which guarentees that person will die, but the rest of the survivors can get generators working quicker, or the killer can run around looking for another survivor to kill, but risk letting the hooked survivor be saved. It's really enjoyable.  The only real downside is everything matchmaking related. I can't host a match as killer and invite my friend (but also have randoms join, it only allows for private game, though that means 1v1). The ranking system is great and all, but it doesn't work, so there is no point, why give really good players a rank when they get paired with new players, for example: I started playing killer, the first 2 games I got paired with new players like me, but after that I started getting paired with people that are rank 10 and below, I even had a game with a 1 and a 5 in it, like damn, how am I suppoed to kill them after only a couple of games experience?",

The only problems I found with the game are perks and skill-based match-making. Perks are either obtained by leveling your charecter, or drops, starting the game with none, a new player is possibly at a disadvantage based on luck, though I feel perks don't usually determine a match. As with skill-based match-making, there is none. A new player can be easily intimidated by a level-20 hunter, as players are thrown in a first come first served basis. Other than that, the game feels very balanced, and makes a great time either playing with randoms or friends.",

There are still many bugs but for me..... I kinda like finding out bugs and glitches.(If they dont make you lose unfairly) The most awesome are lobby graphical glitches.... Meg Thomas combined with Wraith and stuff like that. (If You want to see interesting glitches and moments You can look in my profile screenshots ;-) )  But for me a HUGE BAD thing is that people don´t really play as killers I think. If I play (try to atleast) with my friend it´s REALLY hard to get into a lobby. Like REALLY (getting too dirty here)....... Also I thought more about cons because in comments they are more important.  Goods: +Cool idea and nice execution of it. +The Entity IS AWESOME!!! +Killers are spooky (Im waiting for more ;P ) +Bloodweb is a cool way to level up your characthers +Victims/Survivors have nice little personal perks BUT.....(look in the cons) +Music is awesome! +Good game in the horror and 1v4 genre  Cons: -Many glitches! -Flashlight is REALLY bad. Only noob killers fall for that. -Killers get way too little amounts of bloodpoints. I have killed 4 Victims many times but I got only a little more points (2K or so) than one of the survivors! I understand that because its easier to play as a killer, but can you crank up the noone survived thing then? -Matchmaking is bad (Rank 20-18is get rank 1 killer and the other way around.) -Matchmaking is BAD: i have tried many times about 20 mins to get to play with my friend in ´´survive with friends´´ It seems that there are some time intervalls when YOU CAN`T PLAY THE GAME YOU PAYED 20€ ON!!!! -When killer leaves you WILL not get points and it´s frustrating when you stand in the exit gates to help others BUT you don´t get 5 K -The survivor with Leader perks Is VERY BAD!! Personal perks are understandable but WAY TOO NOOB!!! Just up the % a little. Also it´s the worst guy to hide as because he has a white shirt or bloodred outfit.  -PLEASE fix it: so exit gates can be opened and then the last one not escaped/alive survivor hides. Killer gets bored but can´t quit because then he will lose all points. AND then goes past 10-20mins until survivor is found or escapes. I ADMIT that I have done it as well because I was scared (one of first times playing) Can you just fix it some magical way?  -Also its really easy to play as a Killer....  -ALSO for me atleast THIS GAME GIVES TUMMY ACHES!!! Idk why, I played Alien Isolation and many more horror games...  VERDICT:  This game is good and awesome timewaster, but there are just these little things ( thatsway there are more cons) Atleast Devs fix them and update the game greatly. And for final words:........................... Buy it from a sale ; ) Also If you like this comment/review let me know :P and I shall make more of these. (on different games of course)  ",

            "review_text": "There's not that many bugs. Might find one once a week.  The survive with friends mode has been added, as promised, although that itself is going to make people angry too.  I don't really care about matchmaking. Unless your teammates are in the single digit ranks, they're pretty killable like the rest of us. If you have a good killer, he'll just have some more common sense than the average dunce.  The developers are constantly in a state of balancing the game, trying to please both sides of the game (Killers vs Survivors) which will never be at ease due to both sides wanting the game in their favor. Any issues that cause major imbalance usually get fixed quickly.  The whole 'finding game' issue is a very minor inconvenience. Oh gee, I have to press the button four times instead of once. Not a issue that will drag out the process more than five seconds.  Infinite jukes have been fixed. As reward for fixing it, the developers were greeted with hate. (fixing the issue tipped the balance back in the killer's favor)  If you really care about a rank then you may have issue with the ranking system, as it does not promote winning quickly, but rather playing like the people in horror films, which is an issue when your killer/survivor is a tryhard. (Think dramatic chase scenes and the survivor to narrowly escape, only for the killer to pop back in).  The insta-killer offerings are lame, but I've maybe been killed by them about 2-3 times in the 81 hours of gameplay that I've played, with each match being about ten minutes.  People complain about hook-camping, which is one of the few things that actually is common. Despite there being obvious disadvantages to doing this, people continue to do it. I don't really know how I would fix it, so I can't blame the development team for not fixing it either. They're sort of iffy on the issue, since I've seen them both say that it is a valid strategy, but they seem to frown upon it from judging how they talk about it.  About one in every ten games I will come across lag. It's worth noting that if you really despise it, then you will need to take that into consideration when you decide on buying the game. Due to the game being built upon a peer-to-peer system, you will have to hope that the killer is not someone who doesnt realize how bad their internet is.  A way to test whether someone has bad internet is by typing in pre-game chat and seeing the delay. It isn't a fool-proof method if the lag isn't so bad that it will delay chat but is bad enough to show up in-game, but it helps an unfixable issue.  The way of progressing through the game is through an RNG system, with each level having exactly one perk (random) and other random items which their rarity depends on your level. I have no issue with it, but due to RNG being random, someone is getting the short end of the stick and isn't happy about it.   That's all the major complaints I can think of. If you like the game and really like the gameplay, then these issues will not stop you from playing the game.",

I love to play ronny turiaf, accelerate to hang a there are a lot of times, the experience of the game is a devastating blow. So I hope that the development team to to to the plugin, I've seen more than a good game to end because of the plugin. Then I explain to butcher design proposal, to redesign the butcher skills I am not to hold, I think it will bring me new gaming experience. I want to talk about the butcher in the late game, today's version of the clip the butcher is everyone's favorite ronny turiaf, but in the later period, clip there is no clip available dilemma facing the butcher. I think here can give clip butcher's ability to repair clamp, but it takes some time, let turiaf is a limited time pursuing or repair choice, increase the experience of the game. No hooks in the late next is a butcher, known as the basement of the hook is not destroyed, and there are four hooks, general use less than all, I think if I can handle this kind of not damaging random, every game the basement to ensure one or two hooks shall not damage, the remaining is destructive, random giving to the other hooks on the map. When I was in the basement of the demolition hooks, I go to kill him, it must be very interesting.

If they fix the matchmaking and add in-game communication between survivors, I will change my review.  Edit to add: weeks later and my negative recommendation still stands. The matchmaking is horrible (it takes several minutes just to find a game), it does not match you with people like your rank (nothing quite like being a low-level survivor matched with a top-ranked killer, and vice-versa), you cannot play with your friends (the game simply does not allow it to work), there are several game-breaking issues (such as ring-around-the-rosies created by chokepoints), and the latency on servers is caused by the poor P2P choice. To cherry on top is that anyone who voices these legitimate complaints to the community are met with verbal abuse about how they should just 'git gud.'  Final edit: they fixed the matchmatching, ended the problem of people leaving all the time by hiding levels and ranks from other players, and solved a lot of the match dropping. Not to mention that you are able to play with friends now - it finally works. I'm a happy camper now.",

            "review_text": "When I got this game, I was pretty excited. One of the coolest concepts I have ever seen, sorta like a mature L4D promising actual adrenaline and the thrill of an invincible murderer. This was also like Amnesia where survivors' hopes in escaping is poisoned with how powerful the killer is.  Reality was actually how I thought it would be. There were many chases and scenes, period of times where my (real-life) heart beat as fast avatar's in the game.  I recommend this game because despite the bugs and the current unbalanced state, it's still damn fun.    Now, my warning.   It IS buggy. The game is like a really handsome/sexy individual you wanna date. Only thing is he or she has like an IQ of 80. Perhaps you are just gunning for the looks department here, so I guess you might want to date him or her anyway.  Dead by Daylight is like that. There are going to be some of you looking for a fully optimised game like Overwatch. Even if the game has a cool concept, maybe you ain't gonna have fun as long as the game is still buggy.     That's totally fine.    For people who haven't yet BOUGHT the game, I am just gonna list the current MAJOR bugs/annoyance. I hope it will help in making your decision.      PROS   It's sorta like a multiplayer Amnesia. You can't fight off the killer so you escape, you hide. This concept of being in a hopeless horror game IS ♥♥♥♥ING FUN. The thrill is amazing. All the dopamine and adrenaline like a drug that gets me high. And you live and die- then right to the next game where you can do it again. The perks you can get(passive abilities) also really changes the game so it gets really fun when you get them. You feel the significance of it helping you, really aiding and changing YOUR STYLE of escaping the killer.  You wanna be a team helping aura survivor? Sure. Someone that can sabotaged the killer's stuff? Why not? How about someone more individualistic. You ain't gonna help anyone so your perks are just for you to move faster and quieter? Hell yeah. There are many styles and perks. It's fun to actually experiment with them.   Have the killer caught someone? You have to make a choice now- do you want to risk your live saving the nimcompoop or just try selfishly by yourself to make an escape? It's your life, your choice. And you will be scared while making that choice.        CONS    It's damn buggy. Some minor, some major. You know how you click a button ONCE in other games to queue? Then you sit back, relax and wait till you enter a game? Ain't like that here. You gotta click it a couple of times. It will still only take you a couple of clicks- but there might be time periods where you gotta click more. So yeah- you click to queue. And then after awhile, you might have to CLICK again. And again.      There are exploits to be used- I guess this is a subset of buggyness but I am just gonna explain as another point. You can still win as survivors and killers but there ARE exploits. To me, I feel they ain't being abused that much so it's still alright. Mods are also trying to fix them every patch- and since the game came out, it's WAAAY better. Still, if you hate the very concept and don't have much tolerance for them then yeah okay- maaaaaybe not your thing.     Might feel the game is a tad unbalanced. As every patch nerfs and buffs the killers and survivors, there is a meta. Where a certain killer/survivor is OP and everyone uses them. Yeah this exist. But honestly, most games have this 'meta-complain'.     In conclusion, I still advise you guys to get it. The raw fun I get is too damn great. And I am sure the game will improve into a more optimised state(give the mods some time- they are a pretty small studio).",

This also creates a feeling of distrust since killer can abuse the fact that he is the server. * Bad matchmaking. Matchmaking is kinda random. Be ready to learn how to play the game against seasonal players in your first matches, the game makes a very bad job trying to pair players of equal level of experience/skill, which can be very frustrating in the beginning.

They leave tracks when they run making it easy to find them. Find them, place them on hooks. Wait for their team mates to try and rescue them. Rinse and repeat. As the survivors your job is to not die. Don't make noise, don't run around taking pictures, get the generators, hit space bar, and if you hear your character's heart beat, try not to run, hide instead. Three different killers: wraith, trapper, and hillbilly. Wraith has the ability turn invisible and move really fast, but can't attack when doing so. He's really good at finding survivors but not as good at taking them down. Trapper places bear traps to catch the survivors who enjoy exploiting the fact that survivors can vault windows easier than the killer, or to protect survivors who are being sacrificed. Hillbilly is my fave :). Rev up dat chainsaw and scare survivors out of hiding or use it instead of his primary weapon when chasing down survivors for a 1 hit knockdown. Survivors have a lot of freedom in how they want to play. Knock down hooks with the toolkit to make it harder for the killer to make a sacrifice, heal themselves or team mates with first aid kits, or distract the killer so that another survivor may escape or get a generator running. My biggest problem is too many quitters. Lots of people leave the match because they don't like playing anymore the moment they are caught or sacrificed by the killer. Use that time to watch your team mates and see what they do right or wrong. You can play with friends but only in private matches. This is fine considering unlockables don't really offer much of an advantage but annoying when you realize how cliche random survivors can be. You got the overly confident who keeps vaulting windows and t bagging (funny when you're a trapper though). The saviors who focus only trying to get everyone out alive (doesn't happen), the stupid every worst horror movie actor who's the first to get caught, gets saved, watches her savior get caught, flees, and gets caught again (usually the players who quit early), and the every man for himself guy who goes for a few generators and then waits for everyone else to die so that he can use the escape hatch.",

Instead of being a rag tag group of survivors, you become a telepathic strategic machine, capable of communicating with each other across the map without the killer being able to hear your discord chat. If premade groups become a thing in quick play, the killers will have to be massively buffed.  3 killers allows 3 very different flavors of hunting the survivors. The trapper caters towards strategic players, placing traps to cut off juke points and escapes. The hillbilly is the 'direct' approach, using a chain-saw charge ability to stampede towards players. The wraith (my favorite) is the mind-game killer. So many possibilties of out-thinking players, especially when you have one on a hook, waiting in the shadows and reappearing as soon as a player commits to helping his friend.

(sorry if you don't have enough friends they are adding a fix for this!) -Skill checks are easy, but keep players alert and actually doing something besides clicking and waiting. -Haven't seen a single hacker since launch (day 12 now? Will update later if needed)  Cons: -Buggy as hell---- I excpected a lot less bugs since this just went through alpha and beta just ended but that's okay... every game has bugs they just need to get fixed... -Must have a group of 5 to play with if you're inviting friends for it to be any fun ( this is being added in the next major patch ) -Window jumpers...

I don't have the best laptop in the world, but on low graphics i usually run about 30 to 40 FPS. I strongly recommend this game. P.S. You can play as freaking michel myers chasing around campers!

I watched a few streams where they explained the current problems and what they fixed etc. They finally removed infinite loops and the game started to be very intresting. I'm a rank 1 killer and this was a big problem for me. I could complain about items and offerings but actually I think it's okay; however, some of the players find it 'pointless'. Gameplay is really unique because you are playing vs real ppl and decision making skills matter a lot. As for the game itself, I stopped playing after the last breath DLC came out but I can see that there are other DLCs and game is not dying. New killers, new skills - sounds AWESOME!!!

Besides, if one person dies, the team is at a serious disadvantage the next time the killer decides to be a camper. It's unfortunate, because this game has an amazing concept. Killers just abuse the system.  Other than that, game is addicting and adrenaline pumping. Just needs better balance.",

        {
            "review_text": "As much of a buggy piece of ♥♥♥♥ this game is, it's surprisingly fun and addicting albeit repetitive. When you get used to everything, the ball starts rolling.  Starting off, the game legitimately had me scared. Not cowering-under-the-covers kind of scared, but legitimately nervous and afraid of dying and losing the match because the killer is very intimidating. Especially during moments of pressure when you're being chased down or have to force yourself to not panic in order to sneak and not give up your position, because stealth is very much so rewarded.  This game is not easy, especially when starting off as a survivor. If you're coming into the game ignorant, you're going to be making a LOT of mistakes. That's why it's good to be with friends or 'survive with friends' so that someone's there to show you the ropes. I feel a lot of newcomers jump into this clueless and get salty, which is honestly understandable. This game isn't so casual as it requires some commitment, especially with how grindy it can be with the bloodpoints system. On the contrary, the killer's part is a lot easier. Don't get me wrong, it's not baby mode, you have to at least know what you're doing or you're going to get trolled by teabagging survivors who constantly juke, stealth, and farm bloodpoints from your lack of ignorance. But with some commitment, you'll do just fine as a killer as well.  Survivor and Killer are completely different worlds, and which being more fun is all up to preference, Survivor is more difficult and focuses more on keeping you on edge, where you have to keep a level head and not give away your position. In the end, you have to be as stealthy as possible and not give yourself away unless you absolutely must have to, such as saving a friend from an impending doom. But you gotta be clever too and wary about the kind of noise you make when performing certain actions.  Killer on the other hand is easier and is all about hooking them up. You assert your dominance and gain pleasure from their panic and despair. While Killer is a walk in the park in comparison, you still have to be clever about what you do, because survivors can be just as clever. With the first person perspective, it is surprisingly easy to lose track of your prey or have mind games be played on you. When you overcome this barrier, you'll soon learn that you get the most satisfaction from not only sacrificing survivors, but playing with your food (which coincidentally is a perk too). Camping and securing your kill isn't usually a good thing to do, as hooking survivors repeatedly can net you more bloodpoints (and fun, too). When you hook someone and walk away, they will stop doing generators to help each other, which can clue you in on where they are about to go next. Even if they successfully save someone, they only have a certain amount of times they can be hooked before an instant death. It's very much possible to get lots of bloodpoints without sacrificing a single survivor, because you are moreso rewarded on the amount of actions you perform. But in the end, you would want to get multiple hooks, and if possible, kill absolutely everyone after you've grinded them out.  Now, I'm not here to tell people how to play the game, but the intention here is that you're suppose to be scared as a survivor. If you're teabagging all over the place, can you honestly call yourself scared? No. If you're discouraged from messing around and instinctively try to get out ASAP, can you call yourself at least a little bit worried? Yes. What confuses me the most is when people talk about balance and use that as their entire argument for downvoting the game. I understand that balance is very often important, but in this case, Dead by Daylight is a unique case. Yes, the killer will kill you once they find you. Yes, Michael Myers will one shot you if he keeps staring at you for long enough. But is he impossible to beat? The answer is no. Michael Myers is very strong, one of the strongest infact, but he is not OP like the Nurse once was. Once you figure him out, you'll once again learn that stealth is still very much so rewarded, because being one shotted isn't a thing when he doesn't even know where you are, right? And if he finds you, you're SUPPOSE to be scared and concerned about living or not. There shouldn't be a definitive strategy to never getting caught, such as infinitely juking or hiding. It's kind of dependent on luck. That's why the maps are randomized and never consistently the same. In a way, this games runs off of RNG or situations that are not very easy to control. If you know what to expect, that gives you a sense of security. But no, Dead by Daylight is a game where you should never feel safe and the devs try to make it so with every patch. The killers SHOULD have an advantage over the survivors, otherwise it wouldn't be a 'survivor horror' game, now would it? Now don't get me wrong, there were plenty of times where both sides had unfair advantages or just completely illogical things happening, but the devs handle it as diligently as possible.  And what's with all these people complaining about paid DLC? He's MICHAEL MYERS from Halloween. Do you honestly think the devs can profit off of a licensed franchise and legally get away with it? I feel like there's a bunch of kids these days with mob mentalities who just look at Capcom's DLC practices, then just use that as reference to start hating on all forms of DLC as if they know that the system is corrupt and that they're here to preach the truth and fight the power. Why don't you actually take a little bit of a time out of your day and learn about how corporation works?  In closing, this game is fairly new; a couple months old. It's got a long way to go, and I'm hoping that it goes somewhere within the next year or so. It'll either be dead or still kicking. I'm hoping it's kicking. Despite my hours, I felt I made this review very early. And besides, some argue that this feels like an early access game. And trust me, it sure does feel like one. I'm just hoping there's much more to come in the future. Not just new survivors, killers, and maps, but more objectives and content. I understand it might be kind of difficult to come up with new ideas since honestly, this game is a one-of-a-kind and requires a different approach. Why is this game, with as many bugs as it has, is still frequently played? Because literally no one else has made a game like it. But an exception might be Friday the 13th coming soon.",

            "review_text": "Although outside pressure probably had something to do with its release date  *cough*  before it was done  *cough* (why not closer to halloween?)  I appreciate that this game was released when it was to allow the community to shape the balance and tweaks to gameplay and allow time to grind up points for advancement. I believe this game is a lot of fun for the following reason:   YOU ARE IN A HORROR MOVIE  Previous games have used the multiplayer aspect to pit monsters versus survivors, but not quite on this level before. One can be a helpless survivor, scrambling to escape a never-ending nightmare with others they can choose to cooperate with or bait the monster with to save their own hide. You can be the killer, fast, powerful, and driven with malice to hunt down the other players using cunning and prediction to catch other players off-guard. You get the feeling from each game a new story is unfolding, that you inevitably are a part of. Especially with items that change light levels and fog in the game. Couple that with a kind of misty backstory of a web of blood and you have a weird, awesome, near-lovecraftian experience of confusion, heart-racing, and momentary relief from danger that normally only comes from single-player horror games like FNAF or Slenderman multiplayer.  For those considering buying the game, do it now, as you will need to grind up points for additional perks that make the game more enjoyable. And hey, its $20, not like other high-graphic $40 games that are multiplayer only.  You can't expect the quality to be the same for what you pay.  Plus, you help influence gameplay changes in its continuing development.  ok, enough preaching.  You might want to hold off buying the game if you want a more finished, bug-free game, as the devs are working still on game-balancing, new content, bug-fixing and the like.  A recent patch helped to balance infinite escape spots for survivors, so it is easier to play the killer now in a sense (less abuse of arena).  Perks on certain characters are overpowered versus others, meaning these perks almost never see play.  The ranking system is different from other games and takes some adjustment, as it is not enough to simply win the match while hiding in a corner watching everyone else work.  Ya gotta be brave to get pips.  Disconnects ruin the fun (when has it not in multiplayer gaming?). Perhaps some adjustment to disconnecting so that if a survivor disconnects at very start of match, a generator gets taken off the count or something.  The connections in games vary by match, meaning some matches are laggier than others,  your connection is not going to be stable every game.  Very frustrating when as a survivor you glitch into the view of the killer, or as the killer you can't hit a lagging survivor.",

With this game it is more like: (while running from chainsaw-wielding hillbilly) 'crap, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap....AAAAAAARRGGGHHHH!!!!'  - Then you get hung on a hook.  Cons -- I could see it getting a bit repetitious after dozens of hours in the same environments. The game could definitely benefit from more than just the single 'Fix generator, hang on hook...wait for rescue' formula...even if that variation is only a variety of new animations. -- The environments are good looking...but feel very similar to one-another.

But killers is a whole other story.  You try it once and see four little ****twits teabagging you, teasing waiting at the gate or near the hatch like 'I'm here but you ain't gonna do **** about it'. You play a few more games and slowly start to sympathise with the killers. And then you get gud and start winning. Ah, the satisfaction of smacking a teabagging scumbag and putting him on a hook. The glory of getting a third sacrifice thanks to 'No one escapes death' when they thought they already won and were taunting you. This is the greatest feeling I've ever had in a game. Mind me, the killers are the good guys cleaning this world of filthy trolls and making them suffer while at it. Playing survivors makes me feel so dirty I want to shower afterwards.  Well, if you're a trolling scumbag yourself you'll like this game too. There's plenty of opportunity against newbie killers for you.",

But look a the backstories of some of the killers, most notably the Hillbilly. Anyway, this game is fun. It's hard to get tha hang of, but then once you get it you can get twelve thousand bloodpoints per game easy. I mostly play survivor, because I play with my friends, but I'm much better as a killer. Both sides are balanced, as the survivors if they know what they are doing can easily hide and not get found, or if they are found get away. The killers   are   balanced. Trapper can place traps in random places or stagegically to catch the survivors off guard but the traps can be sabatoged and avoided. The Hillbilly can knock people down instantly and traverse the map quickly, but if you avoid his chainsaw he becomes stunned and that can make the difference between life and death. The Wraith's stealth abilites can be seen through by using premonition and spine chill, and if you don't have those, his breathing is quite loud. The Nurse's teleport is easily avoided and can stun her, letting you get very far away. And finally, Michael. The one eveyone has been compaining about. Sure, he's annoying. His first stage he might as well not have a heartbeat, and pemonition and spine chill don't work. But he's slow and can't lunge very far in that stage. His second stage increases that heartbeat range and his speed, but it's still not as fast as the other killers. Now, the third stage is a bit of a weird one to try and give reasons for it being balanced. It's instant knockdown, super fast, and normal heartbeat. But it dosen't last forever. And if you can escape and hide from him, you can waste it. Then he has to waste more time stalking people to fill that bar up again. The survivors, on the other hand, aren't balanced. I mean that in the way of one survivor being better than another. Claudette's self heal is definately better than Dwight's prove thyself.   But, I do recommend it. Get it. Play it. We could always use more survivors in our ranks.",

Programming isn´t nice, perfomance isn´t nice, loadingtime isn´t nice, playing against people with 4 very rare perks isn´t nice if you are a beginner and much other stuff isn´t nice.  But playing the game is fun. The features like perks are a nice thing to have and to kill someone give you a good feeling.  But playing as survivor sucks because it´s extreme repetetiv, boring, you have a very stupid random quicktimeevent over and over again and playing as survivor is bad rewarded at the end. It´s so easy to get many points as killer instead of being a stupid survivor. Oh and the feeling of being useless, getting jumpscared and wanted only to escape is terrible and no fun at all.

My first impression of this game after having watched the trailer was one of nervous anticipation. I liked the concept and themes of the game I just didn't think it would like up my expectations. I got it on sale and decided to put some time into it. I can say now I don't regret picking up this title. It's a tense edge of your seat multiplayer expierience, where 4 survivors are pitted against an annonoumous, ruthless real-time killer. It could be the chainsaw &amp; hammer wielding 'Hillbilly', or the masked murderer Micheal Myers, or the teleporting, screetching female killer known as 'The Nurse'. Whatever haunts the night, you will have to work together with your fellow survivors to outwit the stalker, and escape his/her domain alive. (In most cases not everyone will make it.) You do this by repairing several generators spread across the map. When enough generators are fixed they will give power to the exit gate and then you can attempt you escape. When found and pursued by the killer, survivors can use various tactics to loose the killer. They include tipping over 'Pallets' to block the killer's path hopefully even stunning the killer. Using items such as a flashlight to briefly blind the pursuer, ect. As the killer your job is obviously to eliminate all survivors or as many as you can get to. You do this by capturing survivors and impaling them on hooks, where they will struggle to stay alive as their health slowly drains. Watch out as some braver survivors may come to unhook their trapped friend. Each survivor/killer has their own perk and leveling system called the 'Bloodweb' Basically this is where you will spend your 'Bloodpoints' to level up your survivors and killers. You purchase items to help you survive, medkits, toolboxes and other perks to progress up the level system. All in all the game is fun, tense, and satisfying. Go ahead... Give it a try :D",

The Devs have acknowledged this, and considering Survive With Friends is fairly new-- as well as the game itself-- it's understandable that tweaks are being fixed.  I appreciate the continued updates from the Devs &amp; their livestreams, where questions from fans are answered (can attest to this, mine was!) and they provided a lot of information on upcoming releases (chapters, bug fixes, etc.) as well as answering questions and taking into account player problems and feedback. Mattieu has said he reads the steam forums a lot (lore especially) and that sort of interaction with Devs/ open communication is appreciated.  tl;dr - Very good game, a few problems but it's a new release &amp; Devs have acknowledged and said they are working on fixes.

The two was to play are quite different as to be expected with something asymetrical.  Killer Pros:    Fun if you enjoy chasing after people    High blood point generation (Bloodpoints are the currency).    26 different perks to choose from at the current moment change your play style.    5 different killers to choose from at the moment with different playstyles.  Cons:    Salt/anger is a huge issue with the survivors.    Can easily be stomped on if you don't know what you are doing or if you're fighting a survive with friends group.    Most killers have a relatively low learning curve. The exception to this is The Nurse with a high learning curve.   Survivor Pros:    32 Survivor perks, larger variation than killers, lots of different and creative builds.    Survive with friends. Can give killers sizeable headaches    Lots of items and addons to choose from to help save/escape with your team.  Cons:    You will get salty. Lots of us do it just happens.    Low blood point generation. THis has been gutted at least twice since I started playing.    Bots. This encourages bots to continuee playing and roam free ruining the experience for others.   Overall Pros:    First game published that in this category.    Somewhat caring developers who host a dev stream every Thursday at 1:00 p.m Eastern.    Wait times for killers and survivors has dropped a bit.  Cons:    Survive with friends throws balance out the window.    The Nurse throws most mechanics out the window.    A somewhat toxic community.    The use of exploits to counter exploits.   I reccomend this game if you enjoy a challenge or if you want to see what kind of killer you would make.",

I still say this game is better enjoyed with friends, only because friends generally wont attack you because they lost. friends generally treat eachother with at least some level of respect. If you dont mind or even enjoy the bitter comments from random people then online play is perfect for you. Im pretty sure only league of legends and the great salt lake rivals the amount of salt generated from this game's players.  A lot of the infinites have been fixed and they even added a mechanic to stop it completely by giving windows a cooldown if used often, closing them temporarily by the spider god. As of right now the devs are working on camping. Despite the unpleasable fanbase, the devs have been working quite persistently to fix the problems introduced and discovered by players themselves. A large enough sample size will always make the flaws stand out more.  Overall its still a fantastic game. There really are only 3 other games like it and they wont even come out until next october (2017)   *edit*  The salt content in this game is deliciously high. It doesnt matter which side you are on, someone is going to be salty about something.   Its a fantastic game. It reminds me a lot of a party game people would play on early fps games called 'Jason' Besides a couple of issues that will be fixed next patch I find this game to be really well balanced. The worst part is people though, because people are generally terrible and selfish they dont like working together.  As killer my only complaint is the window hoping (which will be fixed next patch). My main complaint as survivor is people, and you cant change people.  Next patch is also going to bring in the 'survive with friends' feature, which the lack of is the cause of most of the negative reviews.   Every rare while you run into an honorable opponent, and this game really shines through its flaws. Its a fantastic game and I recommend it to everyone who enjoys this type of game.",

First off, let's talk about Survivors, in which there's several playstyles you can have, but most importantly you don't have to be stealthy, since stealth play is poorly rewarded. If you like the idea of being chased by a Killer and trying to outwit them/juke them, then mastering the Survivor will be a rewarding task. Although if you also enjoy playing stealthily, you'll have plenty of fun trying to sneak around doing objectives(generators) and rescuing teammates.   Then there's the Killer, there's several Killers on deck already, each having a different 'ability.' Furthermore there's different takes on playing the role of Killer, some think it's as straightforward as you try to 'kill' all the Survivors, meanwhile others think it's about having fun and playing around with the Survivors (while still posing a threat of course).   Overall I would say Killer is easier to pick up, but harder to master. Meanwhile Survivor is hard and often scary at first, and later when you become more used to things, it just becomes simple repetition of movements.   And finally I would say the most important thing in this game is to have fun, and be fine with losing. There are plenty of bugs and balance issues, but the core gameplay is fun so I would have to recommend it.",

The developers are also adding new content to the game which means it is still going for now.   The only not so good point of this game is that the latency of the game depends on the killer (not so sure about that).

The problem is it still has a long way to go. There are still many bugs, but now the majority of them don't affect the game too much.  I also feel like they're giving the killer an advantage. Basically I'm saying that the teams aren't completely balanced. I think that was an intentional feature that doesn't need to be fixed. The game itself says that the entity favors the killer. It makes the survivors jobs that much harder. I happen to like a challenge, though.  Camping! OMG! People need to not get salty over it! If the killer is camping, then don't save the guy. It's that simple. And while the killer is camping, you can power a generator or two. If the killer isn't camping, save the guy, because the more people there are, the easier the game will be.  Some perks are pretty useless.... I just don't use them, for the most part. They all are useful sometimes, though.  Overall, though it's buggy the game is worth $20. If you can get it on sale, that's even better.  Data restting?  Hasen't happened to me yet... That's good, but it could still happen. I'd still like the game if my data was reset though.  Good glitch : I got on once and had vanity that was exclusive to YouTubers. I had H2ODelerious's Trapper mask, and Bryce's shirt for Meg, and a panda shirt for Dwight. Dwight was bald and bearded. I had some glitchy mask for the trapper. I had a mask that was just the trapper mask, but it had not textures. It was just solid blue. I also had other stuff.

Don't know if it is just the free weekend but the wait times are immense and sometimes even trying to queue up into a quickplay creates a game breaking glitch where it never loads you into LOADING a lobby. The download rate for new maps is extremely intensive as well, so if you are playing with new players sometimes the maps can take up to 10 minutes to load, and by then most of your team has left.  Another thing is that when there are less than four survivors things are grotesquely not in your favor. The game does try to give you a break and requires one less generator per survivor that left BEFORE the game started (youre SOL if they disconnect mid game. They might as well have died on you) but this is no where near balanced enough as losing a survivor is much more of a loss than one generator is a gain. I have yet to win one of the many 3v1 (or 2v1) games that i was stuck in because of this problem. Sure you can leave as well but you basically ♥♥♥♥ over the person left behind and lose any items you might have tried to take with you.  They desperately need to increase their servers to take on the load they are getting for the free weekend, and they desperately need to correct their game breaking bugs.  That being said if they correct it, this game would be outstanding and a must for any horror lover.",

The idea of the game is brilliant and when it comes to the point where you play a game with or without friends its really fun and thrilling beside some camper noobs and some bugs. The real Problem is the queue. Most of the time you cant join a game and if you were able to its mostly the killer lagging out and lose connection so the game crashes. With the new update it worked for a short time but now i tried 50 times to join a game as a single player which wasnt a problem before the big patch with nurse killer came out. Now i werent able to play for the whole evening and guess what: i payed 20€ for a not working software. Seems not right yes ?  So here is my tip for all of you who want to buy the game. Wait and follow the rewiews. When you see reviews that tell that the queue system is fixed then buy it. If thats not the case buy some game that works and wait. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Update: 22.08.16  - The queue was fixed and the game is now playable. The Dev-Team messed the queue again up in a previous update but then there was the last update where they fixed bugs and now you can find games easily.  - The game is now definetly playable. There are some grafic bugs left and there is still no punishment for leaving players but in general its now a really good game in the early phase with a lot of potential. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Update: 25.08.16 - Because of unknown reasons the queue is again not working for groups of 2 or more. The Solo queue is still buggy and also works worse. This might be the result of an bad algorithm or to few people playing the game to make the existing algorithm work. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Update: 28.08.16 - It seems like the queue is in general fixed. Maybe there is a problem with grouping players when there are a bit few people to match but im positive that the developers can do it and improve the game to a level, where it is fun to play -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Update: 31.08.16 - a New Patch Update Message was implemented - very nice ! - the queue is totally messed up again. I really dont understand what those dev's do with it but was only possible to play 1 freaking game in 2 hours with a 4 man premade group. Really poor. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Update: 18.09.16 - Lets talk about the last 2 weeks of this game. As you can see i reduced the gametime by quiet a few hours but still there are some i played. An lets be honest. I played 3 games. 3 GAMES ! I mean wtf xD I sit there and wait several hours just to play one hour in total. That seems quiet unfair. I guess i will stop playing for now until a patch is released that fixed the queue. And i will report the game to be removed from buying until this is fixed. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Update: 05.11.16 After a 2 month break i gave the game a new try and FINALLY the queue is working. I cant tell when within the last 2 months it was fixed but now the game is a playable game. - New DLC isnt free: I was a bit upset but well nearly every game has DLC's that arent free so im not really suprised it has come to that point here too. But the game is still good without dlc :) -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Update: 23.12.16 Today i was the first time happy a game was canceled haha. The Anti Cheat System works pretty well as i experienced a lot less cheating the last days playing :)",

            "review_text": "Dead By Daylight is a 4vs1 multiplayer horror game where you play as either a survivor or a killer.Now I say 'horror game' but in reality I doubt you'll find the game that scary except for a few jumpscares now and then.In this game your goal is to win by either fixing 5 generators in the map and escaping through the exit gate as survivors,or killing all 4 survivors as killer. Let's go through the game.  As a survivor,you're able to choose from 5 different survivors (7 if you own both dlcs). These 5 survivors are not very different except for personalities and perks which are the game's way of progression. You see,as a survivor you get points by fixing generators,escaping,helping your teammates and etc. These points are known as bloodpoints,which you use in something called the Bloodweb to get items addons and perks. When you finish a Bloodweb you level up.   Items: These are items you get through the bloodweb or through hidden chests in the map (Note that you can only use that item from the chest if you escape with it.),these items include medkits to heal yourself or your team,toolboxes to repair generators quicker or sabotage the killer's hooks so he can't use them,and more. These can be good or bad as they have tiers like common and such.  Addons: These are things you can put in items or killer powers to empower them or make them better.  Perks: These are upgrades you can put on your survivor or killer,every survivor and killer have different perks that do different things.  Now let's talk about the killer. There are 4 killers (6 with dlcs). The killer's goal is to down every survivor by hitting them twice and carrying them to a hook in the map where the survivor will stay until a creature called 'The Entity' comes down and kills them. Basically the survivors are a sacrifice from the killers to the Entity. Every killer has a 'power' which helps them accomplish this,things like putting down bear traps or becoming invisible. They can also attach addons to their powers to make them stronger.  Now I know I'm missing a lot of stuff,but I'll stop right there and talk about the actual game.  Dead By Daylight is a fun game that can give you hours of entertainment,but only if you can endure it's problems.  Yes,the game has many. For example,finding a game as a killer can take a giant amount of time to some people (I once waited 25 minutes),the game requires you to get perks to do good in high levels,but you're only allowed 1 perk until you get to level 15 where you unlock a second perk slot,a third on level 20 and a fourth on level 25,but until you get there you'll only have one perk.There are things like hook camping,perk exploits,infinites and more that can destroy the fun of the game completely to some.  In short,Dead By Daylight is a great game with many problems that the developers are taking a while to fix.If you can get past them,you'll find a fun multiplayer game to play alone or with friends,if you don't,you will not last long before you stop playing completely.  Before I end the review I should mention that:  -The sound design is alright,not bad but not great -The graphics are fine for what they are trying to accomplish -Matches can last around 5-10-20-30 minutes or even longer,it all depends on the killer and the survivors. -Yes,teamwork is a thing but without communication (The game doesn't have voice communication or a chat system so you'll need to talk to friends with a program) it can be very tough to make it work.  Do I reccomend this game? Yes,because I believe you'll enjoy it if you can get past the problems I've mentioned. If not,do not bother with Dead By Daylight,but if you do have an itch for a game like this,look into Friday The 13th: The Game.",

Some people just complain about bugs. Every game has its bugs, but the only major bug in Dead by Daylight is that some people atm are losing their progress. Anyway, there is a post on the forums visible for everyone that tells you to backup your save, and you if you didn't backup your save you can email the devs telling them what you had before losing progress and they will restore it. They even say that the developers release new dlcs instead of fixing bugs. They are just stupid and they don't know how things work. Developers are a team, some people in that team work on creating new content for the game while others work on fixing bugs, animations and everything else.  The only real problem with this game is balance. Balancing in an asymmetrical game is a real challenge. Atm killers need some love because survivors are way stronger. 4 good survivors usually win against a good killer. Anyway, the game gets updated pretty often.",

This is a paradox. A oxymoron. It doesn't make sense and I cannot wrap my head around why this is even a thing..?   If I win the game, under any circumstance I should NEVER de-rank. May'be so make it if you don't get enough points you don't actually rank up but you don't de-rank either? Only when you lose should you de-rank. Change the name of 'Brutal Victory' or any other type of 'victory' if you de-rank or lose a 'pip' after a game and may'be then I wouldn't have a problem with it..

This becomes a massive problem because sometimes you'll move behind cover and then teleport past it or teleport back the way you came, leaving you exposed and visible. -No party system, meaning the only way you can play with friends is via a Private Match where you don't gain rank. -No server browser, which would fix these issues. No customisable graphic settings. You can only cycle through presets. -Killers leaving the moment the escape opens up. -Survivors leaving just before you can hook them  Granted the last two are player problems, but it is something the developers are going to have to severely punish to prevent people doing it.

I literally would have to start over again. 111 hours of playtime wasted because of a simple disconnect. I looked it up in the steam forum trying to fix the issue. Apparently there isn't a fix. 'It's a bug' they told me! Of the million bugs this game has, this one is by far the worst. Killers get stuck in pallets (uploaded a screenshot of that incidence), invisible objects survivors sometimes run into, bugged items which have to be dropped and picked up again to be able to get used, random game crashes, bugged lobbys etc. The devs are doing nothing about it... They only release new content which leads to new bugs. I was extremely frustrated. I found a way to solve the problem: I replaced my savegame with a savegame of a friend. Yes, that's possible. That means you don't have to play a single hour to get all perks and all characters to lvl 50. I consider that as cheating, but hey! The synchronization with the Steam cloud seems to work differently in this game! The Devs have to do something about it, which they don't. There is a new bug right now which causes the survivor to die on the hook even though he was unhooked early enough. Would I recommend this game? No. Do I still play it? Yes.

            "review_text": "As cliche and lame as it may sound, it is with a heavy heart that I have to say I do not recommend this game, as much as I'd like to.  The community is toxic, the developers seem to be largely incompetent as every patch they release further breaks the game both mechanically and balance wise. The Survivors have become overpowered and the Killer will have a very frustrating time killing all of them. Yes, you can kill up to two survivors and still rank up, but the amount of frustrating work you're expected to do to accomplish this is far from fun and satisfying and is more of a chore. Most Survivors abuse infinites and exploits and swarm the hook once a person has been thrown on. And then, when you try to keep your Survivor on the hook, you're called a camper. If you fail to catch all of them, you're teabagged and laughed at.   When I first got this game, I mostly played Killer. My PC was having issues and the lag on Killer was more manageable. Once my PC was fixed, I went over to Survivor for awhile and made it to Rank 9 before the Ranking Season reset. In the past week before writing this, I ventured back over to the side of the Killer. At first it was fun, and I was having reasonable games. Sometimes I got all of the Survivors, sometimes I only got 1 or two. But everyone played fairly and all was fine. But once I hit rank 15, it all went downhill. Survivors started abusing infinites. They started teabagging. They started swarming the hook every time I put someone on. They would be abuse infinites and then accuse me of hook camping in the after game chat. Clearly the Survivors have no fear of the Killer, and the gameplay for them has suffered drastically.  The developers do not care about that, however. They have stated that their statistics show that the Killer is 'winning' rounds just as well as ever. That may be the case, but those statistics say nothing about how the experience was for the player. You can still reasonably win, but the experience you will have will be fraught with frustration and trolling.   For me, presently, the only saving grace for me is that I have enough friends to play Private Matches, where I can play with people who I can trust to play without abusing exploits or teabagging or any of the garbage that you experience in online games. But that's hardly worth the twenty dollars for this game.  The experience for the Killer needs to change. I am not saying they need to be buffed, but something needs to change, because, right now, the Killer side of the game is way to frustrating to be enjoyable. And the game depends on the Killers, needs the Killers. They are essentially the main focus of the game. It is a 4v1 horror game. The Killer needs to be overpowered to a degree for this game to work.  I hate to be that guy, but Friday the 13th is coming out soon, and this game will have serious competition. Regardless of your thoughts of the game, it will be competition. I predict a fair amount of players will migrate to that game. And when that happens, the developers will have to make a decision.  The Killers need to be the focus of the game. Not the Survivors. The Survivors are supposed to be lambs trying to escape the slaughter. The game needs to feel like that. Not like a broken game of hide and seek.",

Killers have noone to kill and gain no points, and Survivors gain no points since they can't escape / are left without teammates to help them.  Wraith is absolutely useless.  Game is plagued by numerous bugs, and there are too many to list here, this is not a bug list.  Propably the main problem is the ranking system. First of all, it has no reason to be there at all. Literally. Second: People leave because they don't want to lose their rank. Third: Most high-rank players are people who abuse the system and gain them without deserving them, such as window-hopping mentioned above, or point farming with Wraith as killer.  Core gameplay is solid and if you have a group of 5 people who are willing to play in private matches, give it a go. Otherwise, wait until all the issues are patched. Devs promised to patch them, and also to add a party MM later (you can't queue with friends yet since that would be imbalanced).  ",

Another huge annoyance is having players from other regions in your game, it gives killers an unfair lag advantage and I hope they set up a better location system in the future. My final complaint is the latest updates which seem to favor the killer more than anything. This is subjective however I don't think many people enjoy a teleporting killer with wallhacks very much. Overall I DO NOT suggest buying this game just yet, I would wait for it to mature a little bit and for the devs to fix some of the issues which range from random crashing to stats being completely wiped.

Dead By Daylight is a survival game where the main goal of the game is to turn on five generators and open an exit game all while one of three possible killers try to sacrifice you to the entity.  Each map is also randomly generated which helps build tension in almost every match. Some of the structures are all the same, but they are placed differently every match. Once you hear the heartbeat and give into a chase your heart will start pumping fast.  There's also the thrill of the kill as you can play as one of three killers. The Wraith is a killer which has the ability where you can mask your heartbeat and turn invisible, but while you're invisible you can't attack anyone. The Trapper which has traps he can use to trap survivors with well placed beartraps and the The Hillbilly which has a chainsaw which gives him an infinite sprint. All killers have strengths and weaknesses and it boils down to your preference.   Now I love this game and I think it's a really fun experience, but it has too many issues to get a positive rating from me.   First of all this games community is absolute trash. It's filled with salty people, who quit as soon as they are dead and killers who aren't able to kill anyone in the match. If a killer leaves the match before you escape then you're gonna derank which is absolute garbage.  The matchmaking is also terrible. It takes forever to get into a game and is even worse for Survive With Friends, it takes around 15 minutes (sometimes even more) to get into a single game, which is absurd since most games last the exact amount of time.  The game also has bugs like character models glitching, items disappearing before the match starts and many more to list here.  Overall Dead By Daylight is an incredibly fun game, but it's too buggy right now for a positive rating. If it was more stable I would say it's definitely worth it, but as of now, wait for a lot of fixes.  Pros: + Terrifying and intense + Fun gameplay for both survivors and killers  Cons: - BUGS,BUGS,BUGS,BUGS - The abandoned survivor/killer system is broken  Final Rating  6/10 ",

However, they didn't stop there and it took single drop of fun out of this game.   Playing as a killer? Remember that matchmaking problem? Yea it's worse as a killer. You can spend half an hour waiting for a game and still not find one because nobody wants to play as a survivor anymore.   If the developers find a way to undo what they have done this game could be great but again. Unfortunately it looks as though they simply don't care what their player base thinks.

Many times players are left wondering why such stupid mechanics exist.  The game has alot of potential, but I really do wonder what goes through the developers heads when they are creating mechanics for this game. No, a killer shouldn't be able to teleport through walls because that destroys the whole premise of the game 'escape from the killer'. No, a killer shouldn't be able to go invisible; premise destroyed. No, surviors shouldn't be able to see each other when one gets put on a hook; premise destroyed.  Finally, the absolute failure to implement basic game functionality is very dissappointing. Note that this game is NOT in early access; this is the full game. With that being said, you might expect a form of match making, the ability to create lobbies and the ability to queue for matches? You'd be wrong.  All in all, the game could do a whole lot better by simplifying and focusing on what makes it a cool idea. Get the basics right, then work from there.",

With the addition of the nurse, who can only be played by those who have bought the game (I agree with doing this entirely though), the other killers have been overshadowed by this broken, easy-mode character. There could have been no other killer concept added into this game that would say 'We only care about hunters.' more than this character does.  Sure, I'm a beginner at this game. I tried it on the free weekend to see if it were worth my time and money. Having this obscenely overpowered killer in seemingly every game I have played however (23 nurses/2 bell guys/1 trap), has been an enlightening experience as to the direction this game is going for me.  As I said, I am a beginner and a potential customer to this game. But the poorly, overlooked fact that: bringing out a character that only people who have already bought the game can play and dangling its unbalanced, sadly designed self over all who are still on the fence about buying the game, isn't going to make people want to buy the game.   All it accomplishes is this:  'If you've already bought this game, deal with this disgustingly broken character and lose whenever you want to play as a survivor, or play a game with no skill involved as the killer. If you haven't already bought our game, here have two days of losing 22 games against mediocre nurses who as any other hunter would lose their game, or be the blessed soul that goes into a game as any other hunter than the nurse. Not because you're amazing and want to have to work for your win, but because we're trying to force you to pay for our game.'  If you want to pull something like that, make it a hunter who isn't broken for the fun of it. Create the most interesting hunter you can, but make it balanced. New characters/champs/heroes/hunters shouldn't be made with strength as its top priority. Yes the strength of the character should be within reason, but what will make people want that character is how its playstyle meshes with that person, and also how interesting a character design it is. A hunter that's already much more fast than survivors doesn't need 3 blink charges or so, thus granting the ability to LITERALLY say 'No.' to EVERYTHING the survivor can utilize to get away. The fact that this hunter was allowed through even testing, let alone in game (especially during a free week), is just dumbfounding.  So buy the game if you want. It's fun, and has a great concept running for it. But it's sick that developers pull these depressing shenanigans.   For me though, I start to realize what type of person/people is/are behind the game I am buying. Yes, money is everything. Do all the sleazy stuff you people want to do for it. Keep working over the simple minded into forking their hard earned cash for your game which is obviously cared a lot about by you. Maybe next time do it in a less obvious, less player base-breaking way.",

Later on in the game I started to think about the OPness from the killer. I can understand that being a killer is really hard, but most of the killers I came across had perks like: Can see survivors in a distance from 16 meters etc. I'm really sorry but for me that's too much(call me a noob). If you just started the game and you come across of one of these it's just impossible to win, except if you're just lucky.   The survivors on the other hand are too weak in my opinion. Without any of the perks you are just too weak to do anything other than hiding or trying to get a generator up.  And I don't even wanna talk about the hackers in the game..like damn..anti-cheatsystem? nuh-uh.  So...yes I'm dissapointed alot in this game, because I was really hyped about it.

            "review_text": "Dead by Daylight, certainly a game that seems to fluctuate in popularity since one of the biggest memes is that the game is literally 'dead by daylight' in terms of player population.  Let me make something very clear: I love this game.  I cannot recommend it, however. Not at this time.  There are plenty of reasons that I like this game: On one side of the coin that is Dead by Daylight, you can play as the Killer and live out the power/stress relief fantasy of killing some very (un)deserving individuals, or at the very least torturing them by hanging them on meat hooks in a wonderfully violent display. On the other side, you can play as the Survivors, who serve as the more tense playstyle as you keep an eye out for the Killer, fix generators, and escape (for now).  The first problem I have with the game, in my experience, is that playing as a Survivor makes the game less tense over time. Yes, in a horror game, you're supposed to be scared from time to time. In Dead by Daylight, however, as you progress in the levels of a Survivor, you start to lose that fear. This loss of fear is pounded down multiple times by several key reasons: Perks, Survive With Friends, and the matchmaking system of the game itself.  Let me clarify that I don't primarily play Survivor, I play Killer more. I try to ENJOY playing Killer, because I like the game from a more casual and fun standpoint over the ingrained competitive aspect. The three things I listed above, however, make playing Killer frustrating, to say the least. Sure, Killers get perks as well, but there's no telling of how long a given perk will remain useful as the developers update the game with buffs and nerfs.  The problem with Perks that I've noticed, at least from the Survivor side, is that certain ones are always used when available to players. Self Care, which grants self-healing at a lower efficiency compared to a Med-Kit, Sprint Burst, which is exactly what it says on the tin, and then Spine Chill or Premonition, two perks that help pinpoint Killer locations, are the established staple perks for Survivors just to compete. Saboteur was previously in this 'meme trinity' of perks as it both removed the key ability of the Trapper Killer, while also let players destroy the meat hooks that they deserve to be hung on. The only reason that I've heard of for this change in the tier of use is that it received a drop in point gain for the use of it. Bear in mind that none of the statistics or the effect itself changed, just the points gained from it. This isn't a real nerf.  Onto the Killer's side of perks, the biggest target in the community as of this moment is Iron Grasp, a perk that makes it harder for Survivors to wiggle free of a Killer's grasp when they've been taken down. This perk was (and probably still is) only used for the sole purpose of countering Saboteur, since what's the point of picking up a Survivor when all of your hooks have been demolished and the only unbreakable ones are on the opposite side of the map? The developers also seem pretty intent on removing the effectiveness of Killer perks, as for the past three dev streams on their respective Twitch channel, they either make no mention of Killer perks, or they proceed to nerf them in some fashion that doesn't affect point gains, but changes the numbers and statistics of the perk, usually lowering them. The next victims on the chopping block for this event, at the time of writing, is A Nurse's Calling, a perk that helps pinpoint Survivors being healed or are injured, Spies From The Shadows, which uses crows in the maps to give signs of recent Survivor activity when spooked.  The next key issue I mentioned was Survive With Friends. Everyone knows what this is, but for those who don't, it's basically a party system for Survivors. Who then go against a random Killer trying to host a lobby. Who then either disbands the lobby when there's 6 seconds left on the countdown because they're a SWF group, or disconnects mid-game because the unfairly precise coordination led to a literal three minute game as all the generators are popped in very quick succession. The mode itself is FINE, but only when the level of communication is matched with the Killer in some way (i.e. text-based communication from the lobby before the game starts.) This mode is unfortunately plagued by people who are usually squatting in a voice-chat medium like Skype, Teamspeak, or Discord, which usually leads to a biased game as players, dead or not, can inform others about Killer locations in a game where communication is meant to be limited and restricted to what is essentially emotes.  Lastly, the final issue. This one is something that many people have complained about, and the developers usually feign a true answer when it's asked. Matchmaking. No, I'm not talking about how the Killer hosts the lobby and the Survivors trickle in and then the game starts. I'm talking about Matchmaking from the more competitive aspect. The game uses a ranking system, separated between the playstyles for each player. Each playstyle starts at the lowest rank (20) and build themselves up to the top (1). The core problem with this that people complain about, and it comes from both sides, is that the matchmaking is broken. And it is, without a doubt. Due to my casual playing, my highest rank in the game I've reached is 19 for the Killer. I'd probably match the rank in Survivor if, at the time I would've ascended in rank, the Internet connection was more stellar than it was. There is a huge disparity in matching ranks, as a Rank 20 fresh Killer can be paired up against a full four-man team of Rank 1-10 Survivors with actual progress on their characters. This has happened to me, and it hasn't only happened to me. I'm personally miffed because developers tend to insist that the issue is being looked into and that there isn't just an influx of Survivors over Killers in terms of player count, but their solutions, if one is proposed, usually never works.  There are many other problems with the game as it stands, including the use of 'infinites' and the very soon to come, very crippling nerfs the Nurse killer might receive, but those main three seem to be the most consistent in complaints and experience, and that is where I will leave it. My hope remains in the game being straightened out at some point in my lifetime, but I harbor serious, crushing doubts.  TL;DR: Due to developer bias or incompetence, Survivors have a massive leg-up on Killers, who are being turned off from the game due to the imbalance of Survivor/Killer perk buffs/nerfs, the Survive With Friends mode, which instills toxic behavior and unfairness, and the broken matchmaking.  Behaviour, as developers, have my respect from Warhammer 40,000: Eternal Crusade, but they also have my ire from this game and their lack of balance in the community.  EDIT: It's still not that great. Also I nominate this game for the 'Villain Best In Need of a Hug' Award.",

But anyways, there is alot of bugs and glitches in the game. I don't experience too many myself but I do more often than I probably should, I think the balancing is more of an issue. The developers dont seem to know much about balancing. Each patch the killer becomes op or the survivor becomes op, it is never inbetween. The queuing system has always been ♥♥♥♥ since release and even in beta and whenever they have attempts to fix it, they just ♥♥♥♥ it up even more. You can wait up to 30 minutes for a game just to be dodged by a killer (if you're playing as survivor) Not only that but the community for this game is absolute garbage, I see more salty ♥♥♥♥ talkers than I do people who say something like 'good game'. For example I got into a game today and since the matchmaking is pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and sets you up with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ killers who are the hosts btw, I was in a pretty laggy situation like I was every game today. I died quickly because the lag was so horrible so my teamates wanted to make fun of me so went up to me while I was on the hook and teabagged around me and would take me off the hook halfway and then cancle the action multiple times and then run away letting me die. After playing a few more games I would just let the killer kill me not wanting to juke in the garbage connection which was on every game. Optimization needs to be better, don't got the best pc but I got a pretty decent one. Lets compare this game with Battlefront which has amazing graphics. I run Battlefront on ultra 60-80 smooth fps. Dead by Daylight, Ultra= 20 fps which isnt stable. Low= 30 Fps which isnt stable either. I will definately give the game a title of being a good game and a really good concept. I think it just fell into the wrong hands to be honest. The devolopers are good at responding to fans though which is good but they dont do much about what they say. They'd rather add some shity cosmetics dlc instead of fixing their game.

You can't even join a friends game through the friends menu.trust me. we tried. And on top of that you don't get awarded any progression for private matches. so for the hour 30 my friends and I played we had nothing to show for it. It's the worst problem with the game. It's taking it's toll on public match making heavily. exspect to wait 3-10 minutes to find a game.  i was fortunate enough to have 4 friends buy it, and we had an amazing time. until one had to leave. then....you can only play with randoms. Making the game become worthless. If the survive with your friends patch ever comes out i can forgive all the little bugs with the game because it is sooooo much fun with friends. but unless that happens soon i'm almost positive a steam refund in is the near future for me.",

Today's update took out many inifinite looping spots for survivors, which I thought was perfectly fine because killers can camp those on hooks. Today's update also added junk/boxes around the map making it hard to reach even simple juke spots, infinite or not yet the killer's speed remains the same. Overall, it could be a fun game but the developer's keep making it worse and worse.  Killer was already easy enough but they just made it even easier.

I have a bit over 2 hours in this game, and in that time I have spent about and hour and 15 minutes looking for matches and about 45 minutes actually playing the game. In over 2 hours of time I have managed just 2 games. That is absurd any way you look at it.  The problem boils down to this:   -Games are hosted client-side by the Killer, who opens a lobby and waits for four Surviors to fill it. The server ends as soon as the game ends. You then have to go through the MMing all over again to find a new game.   -Playing the Killer is way more appealing than playing the Survivors, and you need FOUR times as many Survivors as you do Killers in matchmaking for equalilbrium. The numbers are obviously no where near that, thus resulting in extremely long queue times. tl:dr too many people want to play Killer.  -There is no party system in place, so you have to time when you enter the queue and hope you end up with friends. This results in a Killers lobby being filled with 4 Survivors (after a several minutes wait), only to have 2 of them immediately back out when they realize they aren't with their friends. The remaining 2 survivors stick around for a bit, but when nobody else shows up after a few minutes they invetibly leave as well, leaving the Killer to start the process all over.  I think the game needs to move to a dedicated server system, where players stick around after matches and the Killer rotates. I know I would be a lot more willing to queue as a Survivor if I knew eventually I would be able to play as a Killer without having to go through MMing again.  As it stands, if you want to play as a Killer, good freaking luck.",

Even without glitches, the progression system is incredibly arcane, and the Wraith seems like the obvious choice when it comes to Killers -- being able to walk around completely invisible is pretty useful, it turns out. The guy with the chainsaw can only dash in a (mostly, there's some slight steering) straight line with it, which sucks considering the survivors' whole thing is going around corners, through windows, etc. The third character's traps seem ok, but they aren't very well hidden, and you'd have to be half blind to get caught by them.

The game has been, since launch, a killer-favored game. It probably even should be. That hasn't stopped the dev team from nerfing survivors constantly in every patch.   There was a problem with certain areas of the map exploiting game mechanics so that survivors could infintely run away from killers. You usually saw this in higher level play. It was a serious problem that needed to be fixed, probably by removing/changing the infinite area. The dev team's response? Nerf the mechanics involved in the infinite, instead of just removing the actual source of the problem. The consequence of this nerf? Survivors have an even harder time running away from the killer who is 10% faster than them. It just doens't make sense.   I had high hopes that the game would be fixed and that the dev team would listen to the community about the problems. They haven't. On top of that their solutions are terrible (or there just aren't any 'solutions' at all). I know it's a small team. However, I've seen small teams do amazing things. You know what's not amazing? The dev team only wanting 1 survivor of 4 surviving every round. That's ludicrous. There is a disconnect between what the dev team wants from the game and what is fair/realistic/fun. I'm sorry.

Once you've played as killer a couple dozen times, it's not too 'horrifying' anymore, though.  2. Unique multiplayer cat-and-mice gameplay, reminiscent of other indie survival horror games where you have no weapons (Alien: Isolation, Amnesia: The Dark Descent).  3. It's fairly easy to play as the killer. Even against good teams who had 3 or 4 escapes, I almost always reached the 10,000 point mark to get a rank-up pip.  Bad points (why I don't recommend):  1. There is a huge learning curve on playing survivors. Experienced survivors are good, but new survivors are *terrible*. Three of these terrible ones might be your teammates if you play as survivor. There's some guard against this with the escape hatch that lets a sole survivor escape, but you are reliant on your team to fix two generators first.  2. The perks system gives long-time players a big advantage over players who are newer and haven't unlocked many perks or perk slots.  3. Survivors can all take toolkits or Jake (who doesn't need a toolkit), and destroy all the hooks except the basement hooks. As long as the survivors stay away from the basement, they'll always be able to wiggle from the killer's grasp before being hooked. Per the unique scoring system, the killer can still get over 10,000 points by finding and chopping down survivors, but he can say goodbye to any sacrifice points, and the survivors are nearly guaranteed to escape.  4. The scoring is unique, but not always in a good way. Your skill number doesn't necessarily increase by winning or losing, but rather by points accumulation. This appears to be based around the survivors scoring with Hopeful actions, and the killer scoring with Fearful actions, even if they don't complete their goal (escaping or sacrificing).  5. Sometimes the map can be generated with a lot of circular waist-height obstructions and pallets, resulting in a Benny Hill like situation of the killer chasing a survivor in a big circle. While the killer does move slightly faster, as long as the survivor has a good view of the killer, they can decide to drop the pallet or make a break for it anytime.  6. Grinding for perks, items, etc. is randomly generated, and there are a lot of inconsequential rewards. It can feel useless when you grind and grind and never see the perk you want.",

Anyone who's played knows what the community is like.) -questionable servers to the point where its unplayable (believe me, its not my speed, I may get some latency spikes at times, but this stuff is crazy). I have joined 2 servers to where its only the loading screen, to then were it says 'match result, sacrificed' and my items are gone because of it.  - I can't even explain this one but during a peculiar match. The killer had sliced me through a wall, he then grabs me through it. As he then carrys me away, my character model was not in his arms, but floating upside down next to him. After I was hooked and freed, there was no animation showing me getting off the hook, but the survivor status said I was free. Apparently I somehow phased into a rock behind a hook on MME. My teamates than escape shortly after, leaving me and the killer alone in game at a standstill of who will rage quit first because, I was unable to move and he was unable to land a hit on me.   Granted the game is a fresh release after Beta so bugs and glitches are gonna be there. But to the point where it hinders the game so drasticly irks me.  Honestly I won't give this game a rating because I have mixed feelings, but to be honest, I would not reccomend this game to anyone *AS OF RELEASE*. Sure theres going to be fixes and further development and I'm sure as hell to sit here and follow while hoping for the best, but as of now, I would've rather bought stoags with the money I spent on this game.",

I got it for free from a friend and i thought it was cool until the killer and spawned right across from me and insta found me cause I spawned in his line of sight. The killer then followed me cause you know I had no choice but to start trying to juke because they were instantly following me. The guy was running an offering that lets you insta kill people and insta killed me not even 30 secs in the game meanwhile it took about 20mins to find a game and this ♥♥♥♥ happens. It's not that I don't know how to hide or juke cause I got to rank 1 obviously I have some knowledge but how am I supposed to respond to the killer on me from the start of the game when it wasn't my fault.  The game is just showering itself in its own ♥♥♥♥ consistantly. There are still bugs from beta here. How does that happen. OH YEA it is because they are pushing those bugs down the priority list meanwhile it effects us all the time. They finally do something to assist the survivors from the dumb pallets not working. That doesn't excuse them for having bugs and other problems people have been complaining about for the longest to then just add new content. I would like to actually play the damn game instead of new content. They have the most wonky priority list ever. They dont even have the lore fulling fleshed out.

Released far too early and now they are currently in the process of adding in features that should have been in from day 1. Lack of options/settings. No keybinding changes. (I mean seriously?). The resolution is a ♥♥♥♥ing slider for ♥♥♥♥s sake WHO DOES THAT? Survivors have to deal with laggy killers (purposely lagging their connection so survivors can barely move).  Peer 2 peer connection instead of dedicated servers  Riddled with countless bugs: For example, trapped in terrain, buggy user interface, bloodweb bugs, items bugs, you name it. Quite a few hackers in the game now since the developers were stingy and didnt invest in some decent anticheat software. Possible to lose all progress (happens rarely but gamebreaking nonetheless) There is no Matchmaking system at this moment. If you start the game fresh, it is possible to play against Rank 1s or Level 50s or both. Very difficult to find a game because the killer can pick who they want to play with since they get to see the survivors rank and level. They will 'lobby hop' if they feel that the chance of them winning/ranking up is low. Buggy Match finding, usually can't find a match or kicks you back out to menu screen. Almost impossible to find games with the 'survive with friends mode'. Survive with friends does not have persistent match finding so everytime you fail to find a game it'll unready everyone and you have to wait 5 seconds again so you can't even alt-tab and do something else. Expect to find a single game every 15minutes only to find that the killer lobby hops because he doesn't want to play against a premade team. Developers clearly do not play their own game often since they have no intention of balancing perks/hook camping etc etc. Very unlikely to find good games. You'll manage to get into a game 2/10 times when you press ready, you then have a 5/10 chance that the killer will dodge the game, then you'll have a 5/10 chance you'll be matched with veteran killers/survivors. Then there is a 1/10 chance you'll meet a ESP hacker or you'll find a killer who will hook camp survivors until they die or the killer that ragequits early. So you have a grand total of &lt;1% chance of finding a good game. At high ranks, due to broken perks, no one helps each other because it is far too unlikely to successfully rescue someone as survivors when they are caught. Killers have huge problems when survivors are really fast at fixing generators. Moderators like to ban/lock threads that directly criticises the game so be careful of what you say. Community is slowly becoming more toxic as these issues persists. Overpowered perks for killers as well as for survivors. Killers have to deal with window cheesers. Horrible grind for levels. If you're not prepared to play 300+ hours on this game, do not expect to get the best perks, add-ons, offerings for both killers and survivors. It takes about 50+ hours to get one character to level 50...There are 7 characters. No diversity due to overpowered perks. Some map are completely broken for survivors, i.e. autohaven maps and some maps are completely broken for killers, i.e. sheltered woods.   Pros:  Excellent concept. Potentially the best gameplay for this type of genre.  Conclusion: Game has huge potential but the developers are making very amateurish mistakes. Don't expect many hotfixes/patches often, they work at a snail's pace. Heard rumours that this game is supposed to be competitive (e-sports maybe), but you cannot have a competitive game with perks as broken as the ones in the game. As it is now do NOT purchase this game. If you already have do NOT play more than 2 hours so you can atleast refund it until all of the issues above are addressed.",

There are far too many game breaking bugs or complete annoyances that ruin the game for me, such as;  • No one being able to interact with you while you're downed. • Being grabbed/hit AFTER you jump through the window. • Constant hook glitches (not dying, model bugs, insta death when someone is interrupted). • People DCing and not receiving a penalty. • Killer is host, meaning that latency is based off of them. If they're laggy, everyone else is laggy. • Being teleported due to host's latency. • Still no matchmaking or party system. • Ranking system is complete garbage, you will lose bloodshards and gain them for no reason whether you meet you the 10,000 point minimum requirement. You can also get matched against rank 1 killers and survivors even if you're a rank 20.  This may just be a me gripe, but the development team decided to send 15 of their 35 employees to E3 to showcase what? The game was most definitely rushed, whether it was for E3 or for another reason is unacceptable. How has a game that has been in development for around 3 years end up having this many bugs and absolutely no content? The only answer is a lazy dev that wants a quick buck. This game had potential and it still does if Behaviour manages to get their head out of their ♥♥♥. I haven't had any previous experience with BI, but apparently they aren't really the best people out their. Starbreeze isn't a very good company either, and I know that from playing Payday 2.

Second, the game still feels like it's in BETA with tons of bugs and game ruining flaws. There has been no information or updates from the developer about plans to fix this.  1. Finding a match - for an online game in 2016, this feels like  Battle.net  1.0 which is 20 years old. You will likely find yourself clicking the mouse button many more times to join a game than during the actual game itself. Can the developer not afford to use their own dedicated servers? Having the killer's PC act as a host is bad on so many levels. 2. Spawn locations - the game is programmed to have the killer spawn next to survivor(s), which is no fun. 3. Matchmaking - the algorithm is terrible. The killer can see who is in the lobby but the survivors can't see who they're facing? I've been in many matches with a rank 1 killer, and 4 rank 15-20 survivors. Keep it all anonymous or all transparent. 4. LAG - The game really needs dedicated servers for various regions so it's an even playing field. I could purposely throttle my bandwidth, play as a killer, and I'll win every time. If you're in a laggy game, it's impossible to do any kind of micro control. 5. Maps - The killer does not need to see where the generators are... they are in similar spots everytime, and being able to see where the hooks are is enough 6. Camping Hooks - Is this the game the developers want? The risk/reward for helping your teammates isn't worth it with no penalty for killer's camping you. A killer can easily PIP while camping hooks. As a survivor you get the same points for sabotaging a hook than risking your life to save a teammates. 7. The flashlight - is useless. The game could use more item variety. 8. Skill checks - you WILL make noise when stopping a skill check due to you hearing the killer coming in your area. This happens maybe 50% of the time. You stop the repair/sabotage only to find out there was a skill check happening 0.5 seconds later. This should not happen! You do not even hear the auditory alert by the time you let go of the mouse button. You should be able to stop an action without a penalty like this. You absolutely cannot prevent this from happening. 9. Bugs - For weeks I've noticed bugs where you can get stuck in the map and can't move, or the killer can pick you up but also gets stuck. 10. Hatch locations - need to be easier to find, some maps they are very easy, while others are very random and nearly impossible to find in time. If the match gets to this point, why make it harder on the survivor?  Final thoughts - It's a fun game when it works right, but in my experience the amount of time you have to put in to get that experience is quite a lot. Be prepared for a lot of frustration and hours.",

Tons of bugs, glitches, and balancing issues can really hinder how fun this game can be, and I hate to say it, but leave it feeling REALLY unfinished. I'm really convinced that the devs are very oriented towards killers when it comes to balancing, as they never seem to get nerfed (though rumor has it that several popular killer perks are getting tuned down next patch, whenever that may be), and the meta in its current form HEAVILY favors killers.  Basic synopsis of the game: 1v4 Killer v. Survivors. Survivors have to escape by powering up 5 generators out of 7 spread across the map at random, and killers have to find and kill all of them by placing them on hooks that are also randomly spread across the map. Survivors can't really fight the killer and are just forced to run and 'juke' them using various obstacles and windows. Killers move faster than survivors, but survivors can vault windows and pallets much quicker.  Now with that out of the way, and to make it slightly more confusing, escaping or killing all survivors doesn't guarantee that you win. The game uses a Ranking system, starting from the bottom, at Rank 20, going all the way up to Rank 1, the highest. In order to rank up, you have to earn 'pips' which are rewarded at the end of matches if you earned enough points in four categories (different for both survivors and killers), which include 'objective' points for survivors who focused on fixing generators and ultimately escaping, 'boldness' for confronting the killer head-on and destroying traps and hooks. Most people consider 'winning' to be earning a pip at the end of a match. Making it possible to win even if you died, or didn't hook a single survivor.  And on top of that there's also a leveling system in place where you can level up both your survivors and killers with different 'perks' which will net you different advantages and abilities in game. You also get special one-time offerings that you can use for matches that will change things up and items you can bring with you (and bring back if you escape).  The game's a ton of fun, and thrilling on both sides of the aisle. Why don't I recommend it?  -In the patch before this last one, salty survivors who purposefully disconnected (usually as they were about to be hooked) were punished heavily by losing 3 pip and (usually) having their rank decrease, as well as rewarding the killer of the game with bonus points. This was a good change. What happens when a salty killer does the same when the exit gates are powered and they haven't hooked a single person because they've been playing terribly? NOTHING. No punishment, no repercussion. And the survivors who are auto-disconnected from the game as a result as they're about to win a hefty amount of points? You only get what you've gotten in the match thus far. No bonus points as there are in the killers' case. This is a total double standard that needs to be adressed ASAP. And sometimes, the game will bug out and have the auto-disconnected survivor lose pip for something that wasn't even their fault. Completely unacceptable.  -TONS, and I really mean TONS, of bugs and glitches. Expect to get stuck to walls, slopes and pallets regularly.  -P2P. The killer hosts the match which the survivors connect to them in all cases. Always giving the killer that slight latency advantage. You can be easily screwed over as a survivor if the killer is running their internet from a modem made out of a cardboard box in the middle of the Alaskan wilderness. You'll teleport around, mess up skill checks on generators and hooks, and the killer will nab you from seemingly ridiculous distances. The game should be running on dedicated servers, especially with how big it's become on sites like Twitch. Not to mention it opens up the gateway to lag switching and...  -Cheating. It's pretty rampant. Lots of people (both survivors and killers) are clearly cheating to get their level and rank up to Prestige 3 with only 5 hours played. As well as many blatantly using speed and wallhacks (not very fun to see killers who zip straight towards survivors from halfway across the map with no effort in finding them, or a survivor zipping and teleporting around at lightning speed making them uncatchable for the killer).  -Absolutely ♥♥♥♥ matchmaking. It's very common for Rank 20, level 1s to be paired up with Rank 1, Level 50s. The MMR in this game is pretty much nonexistent (in fact, I'm pretty sure there is none to speak of). Not to mention how long it can take to find a match. Expect up to 5 minutes of mashing the FIND A LOBBY button only to be getting a 'FAILED TO JOIN THE GAME' message.  -Survivor with friends works better now but is still very unpolished and kinda ♥♥♥. You constantly have to requeue and re-Ready up only to constantly get the same 'NO MATCHES FOUND' message. Just feels very poorly designed.  -Hook Camping  - Balance. With the nerfs to juke spots and 'infinites' that came this recent patch (which were very much needed), the game has become EXTREMELY killer-favored. 'But isn't that the point? For killers to have the advantage?' Yes, but the issue is that things are VERY tough for survivors at the moment unless they're running an ultra build from various teachable perks at max rank (Sprint burst, self-care, sabotage, something else, usually spine chill/premonition/adrenaline). If the killer spots you, getting away is nearly impossible in the majority of cases unless they're blind. The devs failed to compensate in their nerfs by adding additional pallets to maps, more places to hide in, larger patches of grass or making grass longer, or even making the tracks that survivors leave last less so that the killer will really have to be on top of their game in order to track survivors. They also haven't adressed how useless some things survivors have like flashlights and closets are. Closets make way too much noise and take time to leave, and crows begin to perch on top if you stay in one for too long, making it so that no one outside of Rank 20s who have had the game for less than 3 hours use them. And flashlights are only ever decent against wraiths, as it stuns them on top of blinding them. Against trappers and hillbillies, though? Useless. There are also many perks for killers, like the notorious No One Escapes Death (NOED) and Iron Grasp, which are just flat out game breaking. NOED can make it so that killers can instadown any survivor and move up to 5% faster after the exit gates have been powered, so are you playing like ♥♥♥♥ the whole match but still need that easy win? NOED is there for you. It just isn't an honest perk that encourages bad play. The fact that the meta REVOLVES around this perk speaks for itself. Fortunately a nerf is in the works which will hopefully even things out. But despite that, many things still need to be fixed before this game becomes truly balanced.  -Pipping for killers is just flat out easier than pipping for survivors. I can't even remember the last time I've lost a pip as killer, even on games where I didn't hook anyone. Doing things like just chasing survivors, only hitting them once and destroying barricades will almost guarantee you a pip alone. Meanwhile with survivor you can destroy 3 hooks, power up 2 generators, save 2 people from hooks, heal them up, and juke the killer for 5 minutes on end and not be guaranteed a pip.  So a super short conclusion to end the rambling: The game CAN be amazing and has a ton of potential, but the devs are very slow to fix anything (I don't even watch their streams that much anymore since they just seem to ignore repeated criticisms and pleas to fix well-known issues, like they don't even seem to understand how their game works at times), and the game is just really one-sided at the moment with a ton of bugs and issues to boot. Wait until it's (hopefully) fixed and balanced before you buy.",

            "review_text": "Great concept, implementation is mostly good, but the game suffers from a few problems that completely break it, at least for me.  First of all it gets stuck on loading screens a lot. We have 5-15min loading times sometimes and one or more players tend to leave so the game is ruined. It also inexplicably freezes in the menu when trying to create/join a game and the only solution is to restart the game.  There are also a few gameplay bugs which can completely change the outcome of the game so they can be really annoying when they happen.   The worst problem is the matchmaking though. It's completely random. Players who just started playing, who have no perks and can barely understand what they're supposed to do get matched against people who played the game for hundreds of hour, who have the best perks and know every aspect of the game. In fact, in most games you will see a bunch of rank 20s (lowest rank) and rank 1s (highest rank). This more often than not results in a one-sided game and frustration for both the experienced players and the newbies. This is really mind-boggling, since there seem to be more than enough players to have short quetimes while finding people around your skill level. A ranking system is already in place, so this issue can be addressed with minimum effort, but it's been a problem for a long time and nothing has been done about it.  The game is a lot of fun when everything goes right, when there are no bugs and people get matched with others around their skill level, but that happens very rarely. maybe once in 3-5 games. In fact, if those things I mentioned would be fixed the game would be great. But until they are I cannot reccommend the game to anyone. And that's also because some of these issues seems easily fixable, but the developers keep creating paid DLCs instead of giving them attention. This is even worse, considering the fact that, from a quick google search I've learned that people were complaining about these issues since the early access version of the game.",

All these technical issues and gameplay issues make it not a very newbie friendly game where you can either get teamed up with someone very new or someone very experienced.  And on the other hand, I can totally understand the frustration of a experienced survivor when they get teamed up with new players like me who die like 5 minutes into the game.  On the progress part, there is no excitement from leveling your characters for me, since all those points are used to unlock 1 times use items most of the time. It's kinda like earning in game money to buy random items that may or may not be useful.  And for those who would just say git gud or something, well, Anyone will get good at a game eventually if they can enjoy the learning process while they play. Games are supposed to be fun right?  All in all, so much potential for the game, but so wasted when it's totally not newbie friendly with too much technical issues.

            "review_text": "Very cool concept, and it could easily work. However, the way they've implemented some aspects of it is completely broken.   There is a lobby system, where you get put into a random lobby. There is no matchmaking beyond this. If you're new and playing as a survivor, you can be put together with 3 other new survivors and have to escape from a monster player that is very experienced, with many hugely advantageous perks, items, and offerings. You'll have none of these, and you cant even see the killer name, rank, perks, anything until after the game, so you can't simply try to switch to a lobby more balanced for your level. This brings me to my next point. . .  Most perks have a very clear advantage (more speed, less cooldown between attacks, break down barricades faster, see downed survivor outlines, etc for monster, faster healing, healing yourself without medic, sprinting, etc as survivor). If all perks were available for all players in the same lobby, I wouldnt find this an issue. But if you're a new player (and you can only equip 1 perk as a new player, and you'll only have a few common ones to choose from) and you're put against someone who has 4 ultra rare (read:ultra powerful) perks, your chance to win, and chance to have fun drop like a rock. Think that's enough? The high ranked players you can randomly be put up against can also equip offerings and items with attachments. Most of these are harmless, like add slightly more charges to a medkit or toolbox, or increase the chance to get a certain map. Some of these can be completely broken, including one killer offering that allows you to kill all survivors when they're downed instantly. This is basically a free win for any competent killer, as downing someone is mostly trivial, but keeping them on a hook is where the real challenge for a killer is. Do you camp the survivor on a hook, or try to stop more generators going up? None of that, because the killer used an offering that basically gave him a free win, with no counterplay, except. . .  July 3 update - A patch fixed most of the broken perk issues. Section removed.  Speaking of winning games, there is a ranking system in the game. The most poorly made one I've ever seen in a video game. I've survived a round, activating 3 generators while distracting the killer for a decent time, and still lost a rank due to only gaining 9.7k points (you need 10k to rank up, any less and you rank down instead. 3k for 3 gens, 5k for surviving, the rest miscallaneous for skill checks, being chased). Instead, people have to rely on cheeseing the game to have a consistant way to rank up, such as purposefully getting hit by the killer for a few extra points, or purposefully allowing a survivor to wiggle free and regrabbing them due to being point starved if you instead go for the objective and try to kill the enemy team as efficiently as possible. It has been one of the most frustrating experiences in all of my time playing when I deranked after hooking all 4 survivors, but because a few of them disconnected before i got the 'sacrificed' points I didnt earn enough points to reach 10k. Quite frankly, getting blasted in the face by a spinbotter in CSGO is more enjoyable.  And on to my last point... The bugs. Downed survivors can become ungrabbable, so you're forced to just watch as they crawl their way to an escape hatch while they're effectively invincible. You can also get stuck if a survivor drops a wodden pallet perfectly on you, ending your game. These wouldnt be a problem if they didnt occur so frequently.  The very, very worst part of this game, to me, is that there is actually something really, really fun and addicting in the game. Hell, I'll probably play the game some more over the week. However, I can't possible recommend this to anyone because, quite frankly, I've seen random free to play korean trash make better balancing and design decisions. I'd love to edit my review in a few weeks time for the positive, and I'd love to switch my recommendation from a 'No' to a 'Yes' because the concept really is fun and fresh. But I'll need the developer to make those fixes before that happens.",

The overall UI of the menus looked great, but do to the buggy feel, they couldn't win me over. The game itself was neat. After playing two matches (and losing both times) I felt like this game lacked any depth or playability. I felt as if I had experienced the entire game within just those two matches. I base this feeling on how similar the matches felt. Both were on different maps and with different killers, yet everything felt the same. I really wanted to like this game and maybe I should have played a few more matches and also tried playing as the Killer (i had little to no interest in being the killer, I wanted to be a defenceless teenager once again) but I just didnt have the feeling or the urge in me to play that I had been hoping for.

            "review_text": "Honestly, this game has a really hooking premise. The gameplay at its core should be, and even sometimes actually is quite intense and thrilling. However, there are a ton of issues that make it difficult just to get into a game, much less actually enjoy it.  First of all, the matchmaking is absolute garbage. It flat-out doesn't work more often than not, either putting you through a lengthy loading screen only to return you back to your loadout/lobby joining screen, or just giving you a 'failed to join game' message outright. I get it, sometimes there are issues, sometimes someone else takes up the last spot in the lobby you're trying to join first, anything can happen, but for a finished product on Steam, this happens WAY too often. On the off-chance that it finally DOES put you into a game, there doesn't seem to be any actual effort to balance out the levels of survivors and the killer. Levels can make a big difference, both giving the killer a large advantage of perks obtained through leveling up over new survivors with absolutely nothing to start off, and giving more experienced survivors 'useless' teammates against what could be an otherwise impossible survival mission.  Second of all, to elaborate on the player level side of the game, there's absolutely no effort to balance things. The wraith is completely OP, having the ability to become almost completely invisible while running at supersonic speed and removing the survivors' ability to tell how far away the killer is by measuring how rapidly the heartbeat effect occurs, since it doesn't seem to occur whenever the killer is invisible. There are also 4 different survivors which are not mutually exclusive in games, and they all have different upgrade trees and unique perks and unlockables, all upgrades and unlocks are random and procedurally generated. Of course, some trees are more viable than others, and some perks and the trees they belong to altogether just seem completely useless. Why? Well...  Everything is weighed heavily in favor of the killer, and this is mostly done by allowing one thing. Camping. Absolutely every killer does it, and there's no reason for them not to. Once they hit you twice to slow you down to a crawl, it's basically game over. There's an option to try and 'wiggle free' before and after the killer sets you on a hook, but it takes way too long to actually do it successfully. There are so many hooks all around the map that it's virtually impossible to wiggle free from the killer before he finds one. And what happens when he sets you on it? He stares at you. He refuses to move his ugly mug more than 2 feet away from you.  Every single time.   Nevermind the fact that it's just plain creepy even in a video game, it cheapens the experience for everyone. There are skill trees specifically designed to help your teammates recover and escape, but it's completely nullified by a killer just camping a hook occupied with his newest captured survivor. Not only does it make this survivor completely useless for anyone playing it, and make other survivors trying to play as a team all-around useless (there goes that 'play as a team OR play selfishly premise!'), but the killer is practically forced to just stare boredly at his newest victim, because, again, there's no reason for him not to, and it ensures that they don't get rescued by another survivor. Maybe this is the way things are intended, but I find that hard to believe since there are so many opportunities where you can try to struggle/recover on your own, albiet uselessly since they have no actual effect, from the very moment after the killer gets a second hit on you. The game is hopelessly hard for the survivors when the killer does camp, and very easy for them when he doesn't camp. There's no sense of balance, no thrill, no excitement, no sense of danger or tense feelings. It's just run forever or be camped forever once you're caught. There's no dynamic gameplay whatsoever, everything just feels tedious.  After a few games, it's easy to figure out that, despite the claim for a unique and procedurally generated experience every time, every game goes the same way. Hide and try to look for generators, and if you get found out, try and run to escape (even though you likely won't since the built-in killer tracking is unreal and absurd), and once you get hit twice, you're dead, but still forced to go through the same wiggle-waggle pattern of uselessness every time. It's tedious, frustrating, and just completely stupid all at the same time.  Oh, and you're guaranteed to lose equipped items that were obtained through leveling up whenever you get sacrificed, and you'll more often than not end up sacrificed because of the reasons mentioned above. The ♥♥♥♥???  I'm now leaning heavily towards a refund since I already feel like I've seen all that I'm ever going to see in every game, especially since, according to the vast majority of this game's playerbase, the devs are allegedly reluctant to fix any bugs or balancing issues which are both plentiful in the game.  P.S. The tutorial very specifically says that you can 'hide in closets, and the killer will NEVER find you.' But he's able to open closets, find you inside, and take you with him as if he hit you three times already and picked you up, even if he never actually saw you enter the closet in the first place. lol?",

It more than lacks in several areas that should have been polished before relase - here are the most glaring:  1) The biggest glaring issue: No partying with friends unless it's a private unranked game. This wouldn;t be so bad if the game wasn't fun only when you had a full party of 5 playing unranked, otherwise it's a boring mess. In the ranked games you are paired with complete randoms all of whom play with a Call of Duty sense of mind that they can solo the world and not bother lifting a finger trying to save a teammate. I have died countless times sacrificing myself to save a teammate or throw myself in the way of a killer and blind him only to havve myself get in a pinch later and everyone scattering to the wind. 2) No in-game chat. You might say this one was done on purpose, but when the game has a MAJOR cripple as stated in point #1 this is a necessity. They could have at least done it creatively - in-game walkie talkies that give off a noise range that the killer can here when he's close - easy to implement and effective until they fix the multiplayer partying. 3) Completely broken lobbying. This is probably one of the most frustrating issues with this game. You will spend a good few minutes just trying to get the game to ALLOW YOU TO PLAY. You click on 'Find a lobby' and the game responds with 'Failed'. Rinse and repeat a few times and then the game starts to act like it's loading to a lobby and then... you're mysteriously backk at the 'Find a lobby' screen? Click on 'Find a lobby' again and you might finally get taken in to a game with players! Everyone clicks on ready... game countdown has begun... grip your seats for a fun ride... WAIT, LOBBY CRASHED! Yeah, do that three or four times in a row and your patience for this game will have been destroyed.  It's unfortunate that this game is plagued with so many issues. It seriously is a fun game and it shines when everything works the way it's supposed to and you don't get stuck with brain-dead teammates. Unfortunately though it seems like the Developers heard that the Friday the 13th game was fundraised and decided to make a mad dash to release this - bugs and all.

(UPDATE: 7/24/2016) So they released the new update to allow team survivor grouping. While it does make the game slightly better - the glitches this game has are simply too numerous.  If you have a group less than 4 prepare to maybe play 1 game every 20 tries, because apparently it's too hard for this game to find a working lobby. Think it might be beter with people? Nope! It works once in every 10~15 tries.  As far as the match making goes - can someone please explain to me the point of ranks? Our group is a mix of 18~20 ranks and we are facing killers that are rank 1? The perks will make it completely one sided that it's boring.  I have to rate this an abysmal 3/10 now. It has dropped a point due to the fact that two major patches have been released since I first rated this and neither improved on their incomplete design.",

Trying to queue to 'survive with friends' is an absolute rage-inducing nightmare. Only buy this game if you plan on playing all by yourself. You won't have the patience for the damaged queuing system.  * Infinite Loops. Survivors can find locations where they can permanently circle and avoid the killer and there's nothing the killer can do about it. Usually involves a window. The harvester on the farm maps is the best example. Survivors will simply jump on and off of it repeatedly (while BM'ing @ the killer) and the killer simply can't touch the survivor.  * Rank-up criteria for survivors. In order to rank up as a survivor, you need to earn enough points. It's not necessarily about surviving. You can play the most perfect game and rank down, or, you can get killed by the killer and rank up if you've earned enough 'blood points'. Very counter-intuitive. Takes the fun out of the game and turns it into a chore/grind.  * Unbalanced matchmaking. If you rise to a certain rank with one character as you level him/her, then switch to another character, you're suddenly at a huge disadvantage because it is matchmaking according to rank and does not take character level into account. It turns leveling up different characters into a grind of game after game of being at a significant disadvantage. No fun.  *** There are hundreds of other things wrong with this game (it feels like it's in an early Alpha state, yet it's considered 'release') but, if those three things were corrected, I could certainly recommend this game.",

The develepors of this game didn't take the time to fix the list of glitches and bugs in this game. Out of the 5 killer matches that i had played, 4 of them i got glitched carrying a person getting stuck to a wall 4 out of those 5 games which take forever to host restart as well. Honestly this game is just wasting more time with either being glitched or players just getting mad and dcing because they got caught early and dont want to lose points. This causes me and the community a headache when they play as a killer and it really hinders you from enjoying the game. Until they patch all the glitches and bugs, this game will be an annoyance and will have a bad review because they took teh little time to even look at all the problems and bugs. The reason why most of these reviews are positive is because most of the players play survivor and theres barely any killers because of the bugs while playing him, and as well as how the survivors camp an infinite juke spots so the killer cant get him and end up playing ring around the rosie for an hour because the match doesn't have a timer which is also annoying. If the player gets caught by chance, they can also dc in which they dont lose anything but, the killer loses points and there rank if they wanted to continue finishing the match. When i saw the killer side I switched roles and played as a survivor the next match, but of course my character had a speed bug and i glitch around the map going faster and outrunning the killer the second match when i played with him. I tried restarting so i can actually have fun and gives the killer a chance but it didn't go away. This game is heavily bugged and survivor favored and isn't even close to being balanced.

Its 1 Monster vs 2 Survivors. That's it. Unfortunately, with my time schedule, I usually have only 1 friend around. So... it's just a 1v1 which is not fun at all, it's easy to just get murdered with no chance of making it.  If we want to play with more people or a full group, we have to queue up into random pug groups, however, you cannot just click 'join game' to join your friend. It doesn't work. Therefore there is an excessively slim chance in getting to play with your friend since its completely random who you'll end up with. So this was a waste of my money, to be fully honest.",

If the killer found you, you could run and try to hide again. Now it is just: Don't let the killer see you or get caught.

Yeah, window hopping sucked, but the solution can't be to board the damn windows up! It is really hard to hide instead, if the killer is right behind you because you can't get away.  And why on earth is the killer able to see the survivors' ranks but the survivors can't see the killer's rank? Every second killer is searching for noobs and leaving if you are above rank 15.   @killers: Maybe think about this and not immediately feel offended, that I questioned your 'skill level'.

In the short amount of time I played during this free weekend I've dealt with the worst hosts (whoever plays as the killer is hosting. No dedicated servers for some ungodly reason), terrible lag, the infinite loading bug dozens of times, and the inability to join a lobby. None of this is due to my connection, mind you. The matchmaking in this game is bad, and the killer being the one hosting the server is alone a huge reason for me to not recommend the game. I usually play later at night, and I have a feeling I'm getting put in a lobby with people playing across the world with dial-up or something. It's bad.  There's also not a whole lot to this game. I enjoy the gameplay for the most part, but I despise how most killers play this game. For example, going against a Trapper? 99% chance he's going to hook a survivor, place four traps all around the hook, and then stand there. Waiting for the player to go down and never giving the survivors a slight chance of saving them.  I get that that's a strategy, but it's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ strategy. Survivors have to just leave their friend and keep working on generators since there's no way to draw the killer away from camping. There's a flashlight that's supposed to stun the killer if you shine it in their face, as far as I understand, but for the life of me and other players I've been matched with we can't get it to work. It does nothing, no matter if they're looking at it, running, standing still, etc. It doesn't affect them.  Every match plays out pretty similar, with the killer finding one player and then camping them until they die and then moving on to the next. I had one match where the killer didn't camp a hook and it was infinitely more fun. There was much more chasing and both the killer and survivors ended up getting WAY more points/XP than the former strategy. And guess what? The killer still won, which is perfectly fine because he played it in a way that was more fun and intense for both teams.  The killer can kill a survivor permanently not just by sitting and camping a hook, but by just hooking the same player twice during a match. That's it for them, they're out, and you got more points in the process.  Sadly, this camping method is too popular with players, and it really makes the game much less fun.  Also, one other thing I absolutely hated about this game is that there's no text chat. I understand why they don't want survivors to chat with each other across the map, but how come there's no proximity text chat? All I can do is point or motion 'follow me'.  Anyway, I don't recommend it. Not enough depth with the gameplay, too many bugs, and the way people play as the killer really ruins the fun for me. I'll be patiently waiting for the Friday the 13th game to hopefully do a better job.",

            "review_text": "TL;DR Just wait for 'Last Year' to come out in November. It looks much better than this game that people play like it's an e-sport.  I should've done more research before buying this game.  The basic premise is this: the 4 survivors spawn in random areas of a procedurally generated map. They must search for generators in the map and power them up, which takes time, unless you work together. Once enough generators are on, the two exit gates will be powered on. The doors must be opened, which also takes time. Once opened, the survivors can escape.  Obviously, the killer's objective is to stop this from happening.   Don't get me wrong, the idea is amazing, but the execution is bad.  You see, there's a ranking system. It doesn't do anything, but in order to rank up, you need to earn blood points. These are earned by doing a variety of things. Survivors get them for starting generators, helping each other, taking risks, and of course, escaping. The killer earns them for setting traps, chasing survivors, and of course, kills. I don't mind this system, as it helps with matchmaking.  Where it falls off is in the fact that the games don't have a winner or loser. The games just end. If you're a survivor, and you die/escape, that's it. You can either leave the game, or spectate until the game ends, which happens when every survivor has escaped or died. You get bonus blood points if you escape as a survivor, and for each kill as the killer.   But there's no feeling of victory or defeat. If I'm the killer, and I kill 2 people, did I win? Did we tie? Game doesn't say. If I'm the only survivor to get out alive, do I still lose?   This isn't a team game where 4 disadvantaged players compete to escape the one advantaged killer. Instead, it's more like ‘5 grinding players all try to level up at the same time'. It's not a team game, it's an individual game where you sometimes may have to do a team action, if you want to level up faster.  The point is this.   People don't play to win, they play to rank up.   That's all they do. They don't give a ♥♥♥♥ if they die, so long as they got enough blood points to rank up. There is no reason for me to try to come back and save you if I already have enough points to level up. I've seen people say things like, “I don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about the others unless I'm close to ranking up.” People only care about getting the next perk.  Oh yeah, there's perks. On the Reddit page for this game, people were discussing perk loadouts and the meta...in a 4v1 horror game. People actually wanna make this an e-sport, which it's never going to become.   The community is also very toxic.  There's also items that can be brought in to the game. Examples are a toolkit, which lets you repair generators faster, med kit, which lets you heal, flashlight, which can be used to blind the killer, and more. If you die with an item equipped, you lose it, and you can't use it again in later games. I kind of like this, as it adds incentive to not dying, making the game more intense, like a horror game should be. However, you may have the unfortune of playing killer against 4 survivors with medkits, and perks to make them heal faster. So good luck winning that game.   In conclusion, if you want a fun, intense, all-against-one horror game, just wait for Last Year to come out in November. That game looks way better.      ",

            "review_text": "Hello. This is the first time I've written a review for a steam game, but I've felt pretty scorned by this game once the honeymoon phase had passed.  The first part of the game is very thrilling when everyone is lvl 19 and 20. People make mistakes, people freak out, and it generally plays I think the way the development team had advertised it. There is one powerful killer that stalks his prey until all survivors have been eliminated or have escaped.  In my opinion it should be very rare that survivors escape. Survivors should be able to gain decent rank depending on how well they struggled to the bitter end, but escaping is something they've made far too easy.   As the game progresses into the lower ranks we find that the survivors have been equiped with so many tools and perks that there is little reason to fear the killer. Very often perks will allow them to easily identify where the killer is and which direction they're coming from with aboslutely no trade-off. Conversely the killer gains perks that mostly assist the killer once a player has been caught or has been damaged. As fun as the perks may be for the killer (like insidious perk for ambushing players), they don't assist with finding the survivors. So when the survivor has spine chill and premonition, you're never going to find a good survivor purely because the perks become their new heartbeat monitor.   I was lucky enough as a survivor to get spinechill 3 very very early. My win-rate skyrocketed on that perk alone because I could leave the area whilst my teammates had no clue why I was leaving. I knew the killer was looking my way (cloaked or not) and I could prepare to hide far in advance. This immediately kills the fear in beind hunted and just turns it into a little game of watch the spine chill detector; patience will win you most of the games at that point.  The perks for killer that tell you when a survivor is within 32 meters, and the one that allows crows to communicate with you are not terribly effective as a 32 meter radius could waste all your time looking. The crows only seem to tell you when someone is AFK.   One of the big killers for the game once you go into the lower ranks is window vaulting exploit. There's currently no cooldown on window hopping and most fo the maps are set up to allow survivors to lead the killer on an infinite loop through windows and doors where unless you're the trapper, you can't counter. You can kill all the other survivors then play infinite loop with the last survivor until one of you gets bored. THIS IS TERRIBLE GAME DESIGN. Immersion is lost, and the survivor gets all the power. Players have been known to farm killers for points and have even been know to chase the killer to egg them into following them through an infinite loop. Until this is fixed I play the game less and less.   I would really like to see most of the survivor perks go away, and really limit the perks for the killer as well. Things like Insidious, Hardended Grip *I think it's called*, and monstrous shrine are passives that only help you if you catch a survivor through a successful chase. I dislike the perks that make you completely OP in a categoy (ie. one hit knockdowns when exit gates are open).   This game is without a doubt going through an experimental phase. If you want to get yourself frustrated over t-bagging survivors that will stand on the other side of the window and crouchspam and self-heal then by all means come and play, but I think folks are looking for survival horror. Nothing horrifying about cocky survivors- the ball should always be in the killers court or there is no fear.",

            "review_text": "TL;DR Just wait for 'Last Year' to come out in November. It looks much better than this game that people play like it's an e-sport.  I should've done more research before buying this game.  The basic premise is this: the 4 survivors spawn in random areas of a procedurally generated map. They must search for generators in the map and power them up, which takes time, unless you work together. Once enough generators are on, the two exit gates will be powered on. The doors must be opened, which also takes time. Once opened, the survivors can escape.  Obviously, the killer's objective is to stop this from happening.   Don't get me wrong, the idea is amazing, but the execution is bad.  You see, there's a ranking system. It doesn't do anything, but in order to rank up, you need to earn blood points. These are earned by doing a variety of things. Survivors get them for starting generators, helping each other, taking risks, and of course, escaping. The killer earns them for setting traps, chasing survivors, and of course, kills. I don't mind this system, as it helps with matchmaking.  Where it falls off is in the fact that the games don't have a winner or loser. The games just end. If you're a survivor, and you die/escape, that's it. You can either leave the game, or spectate until the game ends, which happens when every survivor has escaped or died. You get bonus blood points if you escape as a survivor, and for each kill as the killer.   But there's no feeling of victory or defeat. If I'm the killer, and I kill 2 people, did I win? Did we tie? Game doesn't say. If I'm the only survivor to get out alive, do I still lose?   This isn't a team game where 4 disadvantaged players compete to escape the one advantaged killer. Instead, it's more like ‘5 grinding players all try to level up at the same time'. It's not a team game, it's an individual game where you sometimes may have to do a team action, if you want to level up faster.  The point is this.   People don't play to win, they play to rank up.   That's all they do. They don't give a ♥♥♥♥ if they die, so long as they got enough blood points to rank up. There is no reason for me to try to come back and save you if I already have enough points to level up. I've seen people say things like, “I don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about the others unless I'm close to ranking up.” People only care about getting the next perk.  Oh yeah, there's perks. On the Reddit page for this game, people were discussing perk loadouts and the meta...in a 4v1 horror game. People actually wanna make this an e-sport, which it's never going to become.   The community is also very toxic.  There's also items that can be brought in to the game. Examples are a toolkit, which lets you repair generators faster, med kit, which lets you heal, flashlight, which can be used to blind the killer, and more. If you die with an item equipped, you lose it, and you can't use it again in later games. I kind of like this, as it adds incentive to not dying, making the game more intense, like a horror game should be. However, you may have the unfortune of playing killer against 4 survivors with medkits, and perks to make them heal faster. So good luck winning that game.   In conclusion, if you want a fun, intense, all-against-one horror game, just wait for Last Year to come out in November. That game looks way better.      ",

She can blink over walls this for great distance up to 3-4 blink, almost impossible to juke unless the nurse jukes herself. this killer was made against the fundamentals of the game wich is hiding and running away to 'safety' where there are pallets.

By allowing people to have a choice to support the developers by releasing it as an early access like so many other indie developers do to earn money for development.  This game launched with issues that should have never been in a polished game:  1. No Matchmaking System. This game released on June 14th and just about 5 days ago they hired somebody to create a matchmaking system. Let it sink into your mind for a second that they waited about 22 days after the release of their game to begin working on this problem, not to mention the time they had during development and beta.  2. Poor Map Design: During the entire span of their development, they had not once considered problem areas in their map layouts, such as creating infinite juke spots that would lead to players leaving matches, exploiting for points, and hindering their own concept for their game . . . *their own concept*. Its now been 27 days since launch, and this is an issue that was not solved earlier due to poor map concept design, lack of testing, and a proper amount of beta time. Their reason, 'When we tested the game ourselves, we played properly and didn't consider how other people would play our game.' See previous point about a lack of proper testing, which an early access would have provided funds and proper testing by the community.  3. Bugs that crash or break the game: There are too many of these bugs in the game that should have been caught earlier. We're not talking about bugs that show up occasionally, but rather bugs that crash your game (sometimes games crash up to 4 times in a row), to simple things that shouldn't have been missed like players getting stuck on the map.  4. Implementing Ambiguous Systems After Launch: They never planned on releasing play with friends, and even though they spent 6 weeks of creating and implementing this system, it wasn't even live for a single day before they had to remove it because it didn't work. This is a lost of resources, time, and focus on dire areas that could have been fixed and worked on.  There are so many other issues here. Don't forget the funds they get from their publishers. Also one more thing this is the type of people who will comment if you go on the forums to complain and also the mods will probably find any reason to no reason at all to ban you because you disagree...

However, this time all players who want to play the new killer (an incredibly strong one no less), has to pay for the DLC. Not like the Nurse update where we were given content we paid for, no this time you pay 25% of the games original cost.   Thats when the first red flags started popping up in my head, not good, players shouldn't have to pay for DLCs before the game is even finished properly (they basicly released the game as-is, with alot of bugs, especially a party queue bug where you had to requeue for up to an hour before getting yourself and your friends into a game).  And then again, the new update is here, with a new killer, the Hag, pay 25% of game price to play her. What do I do?

Every fix so far has made problems worse/added new problems. All the devs seem to do is add dlc/content when the game is still barely working. The que system and lobby system in general is a nightmare.   The 'Killers' in this game make the lobby and the lobby depends on their connection so if you don't have an AMAZING connection as killer it's lag city for you and the 'survivors'. The game locks up/crashes often. People still occasionally fall through the world. Killers rage quit/dc and you lose points for not 'surviving'. If you don't dc on purpose as a survival you can lose a large amount of 'pips' that you need to rank up in the game.  It just seems like the typical trend for many game devs lately. Make game that barely works. Never fix. Add dlc/content. profit. Zero accountability. You also rarely hear/see the devs. They rarely if ever stream the game (most likely due to how horribly broken it is)  TLDR: Don't buy it. It's broken. Don't 'feed' the devs. ",

More over not only can you not play with friends you can't even play with the community. Basically there are no redeeming social aspects to the game and for that I give it a huge thumbs down. I have read that the dev is 'working' on making group play a real thing but before that they want to make sure people who drop out of games early are punished better. I don't understand why this game even has a ranking system or trys to promote any kind of e sports functions. If it was a lets try to survive a psycho killer with your friends that had all the fun and screams that I enjoyed with a full group of people then it would be a home run. Sadly Starbreeze Studios really dropped the ball on this one. I would check back in on this to see if they fix the social issue because it is super fun just not alone.",

The idea of having to hide from a killer as you have to power up generators is an awesome idea and it has some other awesome editions like finding chests that bestow an item that can help you survive. But that's where the pluses end. Horrible balancing, frequent lag spikes, extremely unstable matchmaking system, falling through maps, nonsensical point system, and much more.   It's a common occurence where I have to mash the 'find match button' over and over since it can never find a game. I don't know if that's the servers not being able to handle it, or if the game is just poorly made. When I finally get in a match, it turns out I didn't just instead that my character model is stuffed inside another and now I'm forced to restart my game for a third time to find a match. Then when I finally get into a match I have a team of 2 other level 20 players, a level 19 player, all of us pinned against a level 1 killer. I don't even know how that happens.   Well when I finally manage to get into a game that's balanced skill wise and isn't lagging all over the place, there's the semi frequent chance that when the killer swings at me, they clip under the map. This of course ends with them leaving, so the match ends and I lose a pip since a match was completed but I didn't get enough points to earn a pip. How could I since the match went on for 40 seconds. Oh, and that offering for a 75% bonus for survival? Yeah now that's gone too.   But in the off chance you manage to avoid all these problems and have a stable connection and a balanced team, because of how the point system is laid out it's not uncommon to find a killer who just looms over you and doesn't swing since they get points for 'Chasing' you so that experience you were excited to get isn't going to happen this match. You can disconnect if you want but you'll lose a pip of course so instead you just have to meander along for the rest of the match and hope you get a normal game somewhere down the line.   There are other things I don't like about the game that are just personal dislikes (Such as a perk system similar to Call of Duty making it horribly unfair for new players since they will go against people who have been playing longer and have in game bonus effects helping them on top of just experience) but those are personal dislikes and not fundemental bugs that shouldn't be in a game.   Overall this game is kinda fun with friends, but the inconsistent hitboxes (Like that one flipping rock on that hill that has a massive and invisible 'hitbox' so when you try to run from the killer you get stuck on it) and SUPER buggy lobby system can make it get old pretty quick. Overall, this game is a fantastic concept and somewhere down the line can be made to be pretty good, but this game is in NO WAY worth any money out of your pocket in it's current shape.",

However, its technical flaws were not something I was willing to overcome. To begin with, usually when a game says it has partial controller support it's because it has a launcher or some other minor element that needs a mouse and keyboard. This is not the case.   Here, the controller is completely dead, save for the b button to go back in menus, until you get into the actual game. And even then it can be kind of spotty. There aren't any resolution options. What is there in its place is a slider that goes to 100%. Sliding this makes only the slightest bit of difference in visual fidelity.   It looked to me like it was set to 720p or even lower than that. The text and all the edges of objects, naturally, were very blurry at this resolution. This is on a 4K tv by the way. There is an auto detect option, but ticking it did not make any noticeable difference.   The game itself is great, but I play first person action games with a controller. The amount of back and forth between controller and KB+M just wasn't worth it to me. It became too annoying. But if this is not at all an issue for you, there is definitely a lot of fun to be found here.   Personally, I plan to wait until much later, when all the kinks are worked out.",

Killers already have increased movement speed and skills to hunt down survivors, but all the games I've played the killer camps the hooked survivor making it impossible to rescue someone. People will say 'then just fix the generators'... people who say this are ♥♥♥♥ers who don't know teamwork. There needs to be something added to the game to make the killer keep moving or an extreme buff to survivor if the killer camps, the moment your hooked, your as good as dead, Its frustrating because It makes waiting to get into a lobby and starting a game is longer than playing the game itself.  -Leavers... If the killer leaves the game, it should be an instant win to the survivors. Thats why I say Peer to Peer type games are problematic because if the Killer (host) leaves when Survivors are about to win, the game is considered NULL/VOID... Survivors are the ones who are affected most when there are leavers... If a Survivor leaves... now you have to fix 5 Generators instead of just 4... Leavers completely tilt the game into the Killers favor regardless of whoever leaves... IT COMPLETELY RUINS THE GAME.

It is just ridiculous of how long the wait times are, how buggy the matchmaking is, and how horrid the connection is when you actually join a game.

Being a killer is fun because laying traps, chainsawing or sneaking up on people with your cloak can be pretty exciting. When the survivors aren't cheesing you in cheap spots then the chases are challenging and fun.   Being a survivor is fun albeit very frustrating and challenging at times. Keep in mind the killer can go faster than you so outsmarting him is key, and takes practice. Teamwork is key. This game relies heavily on everybody working as a team and watching each others back. The killers are rather overpowered too. There's a perk called No One Escapes Death. This perk makes it to where after you complete your objective of cranking 5 generators, the killer turns into a walking source of overpowered ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, and downs you in one single hit. Another reason this perk is OP, is it prevents your teammates from saving you. Once the killer downs someone and everyone is aware that he has NOED, no one is gonna attempt a rescue because they subjecting themselves to death as well.  The grind is slow but well worth it. The game is fun regardless, but the more you slowly rank up, the more perks and offerings you get and the more fun the game gets, as you can be more resourceful and helpful in aiding your teams escape.   However, the reason I can't recommend this game at this time, is because of the game breaking bugs, exploits, and the lack of an anti-cheat. I've run into a few obvious cheaters, but the worst ones are the subtle cheaters who use wall hacks. In the last 3 hours I've run into about 5 killers using wall hacks. This is extremely frustrating and game breaking. Forcing me to lose rank because of people not playing fair. Exploits.. An example of a current exploit is an offering exclusive to the Hillbilly that is supposed to make it harder to revive a survivor downed by the chainsaw, instead the offering makes it impossible to revive your teammate past 50%, so as soon as he downs someone with the chainsaw, that's it for that survivor. Bugs.. This game is plagued with them. This game is obviously unpolished and wasn't ready for release. There are spots on the map that you can get stuck on. That's right, all you gotta do is walk past some spot and bam, your character gets stuck in place and you're done. Sometimes when you escape a killers grasp, your character gets stuck in some glitched state where he hops escessively and you can't interact with anything, making you an easy target.   Once the cheaters are gone, these bugs and exploits are fixed I will happily write another review recommending this game, because when it works properly, it's a blast to play.",

I now get hit once and just stand there, because it's just dumb to run. I'll jump through that window, but just delay the inevitable. And the killer doesn't care how much time I waste, because the survivors need to turn on 5 generators and open the gate. The killer has more than enough time to take each survivor out, and enjoy the brief 30 second getaway that each survivor attempts. I also have no desire to play the killer.

The game has a unique concept, 4 vs 1, survival mode, no weapons, no hero's running around at survival mode, seems like a unique mode; yes it is. this concept deserves 3 out of 10 votes.  the 4th out of 10 votes, is the graphics, the gameplay etc, it's not bad, looks friendly, adjusts friendly etc.  4/10  5 out of 10 is that the community seems rather ok...

Some killer characters are HUGELY overrated, and non-the less over powered. When you look at the bloody community everyone replies you shouldn't whine or whatever, you just ask information.  For now my conclusion is rather simple;  The game concept is brilliant, the community and the supporters of the communty give it a grey angle, when you continue looking and playing, it has a HUGE black angle. Save you money for now, or the developers should promise an improvement. It feels like a game that is in EARLY ACCES!.  Personal message to the dev's;  - Please mind the critics, they have an idea of what a good game should be. - Please consider a cleansing of the people 'supporting' your game and giving all sorts of answers that doesn't fit any sort of context. - Also; you have a golden concept! - you made a pretty good game, please balance it a little better, camping of the killer at the hook, should be forbidden, or at least have a goal for the survivor hanging there.

            "review_text": "fun game dont get me wrong but the community is exceedingly bad and even worse is the match making system. played about 5 rounds as survivor and 4 as killer. (and if you have problems this early on to the point i did, its pretty bad)  The killer i was matched up against people with items, perks, offerings you name it they had it, on my first killer game and every game since then. what is the point of having a ranked system in place if it doesnt work at all, so i did bad 3 out of 4 of the killer games and only got 2 people on the game i did good. One of these games i got nobody killed and had very little points, after the game found out after that everyone was a high rank in the lobby. My highest killer is a level 2 nurse and the other team said that before the reset they were rank 5 and level 30+. what a fantastic system.  apparently the only way to do good as the killer is to play the trapper and just camp someone untill they die, dont worry if your not having any fun and have to rely on cheap tactics to win, that is the fun according to the community. unless its the survivor community, then your trash because your not handing them a free win.  The survivor 5 games as a survivor and ill tell you, winning as the survivor is super easy unless your vs an exceedingly good killer. I ♥♥♥♥ing suck at this game and i won 3 out of the 5 games i played as survivor . Its so uneven it isnt even funny. Its a 4v1 for a start and most of the time if you play moderatly smart or just dont run around like a dishit you will win, and if you dont win, just talk a lot of ♥♥♥♥ about everyone else in the entre game, you will fit right in with this community.  But if your not winning its because your actually helping your team, ♥♥♥♥ your team. just let them all die and excape with a free win anyway and tons of points. why let something like helping other players and attempting to win as a team hold you down when you can run into the celler when your team is on hooks or getting attacked, grab the item in the celler and then hide in a corner until either your team wins or the trap door opens. Thats what every single guide will pretty much tell you, because as long as you excape, you win this game.  The only downside of being a survivor is the fact that the game itself is bugged, a lot of the time you will turn a sharp corner only to rubberband backwords because the connection is based on the killer, and anyone can play the killer. The devs for some reason also decided that if you pull the trap down onto a killer they should teleport though the trap right behind you, no clue why this is a thing but every time i asked about it to the community i just got hate. Finally if the killer decides you're being to good, he can leave and get all the points he obtained and you get nothing as a survivor.  ",

Random levels is...meh, like you just look for the generators anyway everything else is a bit pointless when you think about it.  Ranking and progressing doesn't feel rewarding at all, you lose items you unlock (seriously where the fuuu is my flashlight ??), and the ranks thingy seems very punishing.

If you are laying down on the ground, it takes forever to recover, and once you do, you can't do anything. Once across a pallet, the killer can still grab you or hit you. Most online killers camp the hooked person. The perks are overpowered. You don't get points in a private game, yet you have nothing unlocked. The volume for the startup cutscene doesn't change even if you change the volume for the game itself. It's still stupid that you can die instantly on a hook when you have full health. If you take a survivor off the hook, there's a rare chance that they'll be stuck inside the beam that holds the hook. The survivors should get points if the killer leaves, since the killer gets points if survivors leave. The survivors should be allowed to see where an afk/camping killer is since the killer can see where camping/afk survivors are. There isn't a way to chat with the killer at all, or the survivors after the game starts. I understand a ranked system, but don't make it so that you can go backwards when trying to get achievements for the game. That's absolutely obnoxious. Playing with level ones and level fifties at the same time makes the game extremely unbalanced, the matchmaking system needs a complete overhaul. Camping is also not a strategy. It's a game ruiner. If the developers would like to claim it's a fair and fun strategy, then perhaps they should actually play their game with the campers who put multiple traps right under the hook and stand there watching the survivor from 5 feet away. If the game isn't loading and you need to exit out and join back in, or the game crashes, you can go backwards in the survivor rank. Who is the idiot that came up with this system? You can go in the hatch/trapdoor, and it can close, but the killer can still grab you. This game needs a complete overhaul.  Let me just add on that I finished a game and I was a survivor rank 16, steam went offline for maintenance, and DBD dropped me to survivor rank 18, and took away my blood points for that game.",

Voice chatting will give you huge advantage.  As a killer, you're not supposed to kill the survivor, just play with them. If you managed to kill 4 of them in less than 2 minutes for exemple, you'll get less reward than just playing.

Killer will dodge, and as survivor you'll have to find another game (this is REALLY annoying) Because of clipping, some killer may able to see you behind tree/rocks.

I've yet to lose a match as the killer, only one person has gotten away from me through the hatch (including beta). People crying about wraith needs a nerf haven't played against people that actually know how to play survivor. Its really easy to hear the wraith coming from a mile away and its not completely invisible, imagine predator.   Also what needs to be fixed if the killer leaves you lose that match as the survivor. So if you are the last one and about to jump into the hatch then the killer disconnects you lose.   This game might be better in a few weeks so I recommend holding off until then. Its has potential just needs work. Also, there is no party system yet but they said they plan on implementing one just no word on when they will do it. Which is why I recommend waiting until they add it if you plan on playing with friends. Yes, you can play in private lobbies and it adjust for the amount of player you have but eventually you're going to want to play in public matches with friends.   6.5/10   Price is good, just needs a lot of work.

Unless you know the endless loops in the game to just aggravate the killer and ruin the game for all those in it, its really not worth it. It is far too easy to play as a survivor especially when you have people that know these loops.  Overall, the game is maybe 3/10.

The problem with the players is that like any other video game, they have figured a way to game the system so it ruins the fun of the game. The biggest thing about the premise is that you are supposed to get away, but too many people have figured how to obstacle hop. The will just sit there and wait for you to come for them and hop through a window. You go all the way around, they jump back through. The do it with the crates as well until you breal them. It's so incredibly lame as a killer it makes you want to just quit playing because while one person is obstacle hoping the other players are all targeting generators. Which brings us to problem number two int he premise is that the game is only one mode and it's got boring FAST. Players are supposed to turn on generators to open the escape and get out. That's it. Nothing more. It's really awful in that department because the game never changes for the Killer. You try to catch people, and for the most part you can get a few kills, but anyone who has played more than 10 minutes obstacle hops you to bordome.  The hacking is not TOO bad, but a lot of people are using some sort of speed cheat and ability to see you and other players. It ruins the game too.  I was really hoping for a survival mode to which there is like a huanted house or something to which the survivors tried to live as long as possible. The generator defense game just ruins the game for me.   I bought the deluxe on sale, and $30 later I am highly dissatisfied with the game. The content that is supposed to be with the deluxe edition isn't even there. This game is practically in early access and it's listed as a full game. Shameless devcelopers.   It pains me to not reccomend the game because it feels like it's soon to become a DLC ♥♥♥♥♥ . It's inevitable for that too happen.

            "review_text": "  Just a note, I played during the free weekend... I really wanted to love this game. I loved being thrilled by the chime of the bell. I loved the adrenaline when the chainsaw revved. The way that the killer has a red glow in front of his face, that is absolutely chilling as it creeps by while you're hiding in a bush. The first hour was absolutely delightful. Both as the killer and the survivor, there is a lot of immersive elements to the game... well. Until you run into the point where being thrilled by getting killed suddenly isn't very fun, it's very frustrating. When you get stuck in a pallet as a killer, when you run into a closet instead of vaulting over that window that could have saved you, when the chainsaw guy gets stuck and everyone has a free-for-all with generators.. Overall, I hated playing the killer. As a noobie, it was fun and I thought I was decent at it, but there are little mechanics that nobody explains to you. I try to give people a chance... I try not to camp hooks, I try to be clever and have fun, but if I don't camp the hooks, they get destroyed. One game, all of my hooks got destroyed. I would have won, except, literally there was not a hook left on the map to hang people on that I knew of... Then, after I had knocked down the last two players, I decided to let them bleed out because.. well what else was I supposed to do? Of course upon reading about it, apparently in the basement there are hooks that could not be destroyed... but I didn't know that, being a scrublord noobwaffle, so I got reported.. Well, it doesn't matter anyway, because you'll always get reported as the killer. You can try to be a good killer, but unless all four survivors walk away, you literally get reported every time. I literally was able to only kill one survivor one game, and they literally reported me just because I killed them... Isn't that the point of the game..? If that says ANYTHING about the community. There will be trolls everywhere, but perhaps it was the free-weekend that this game was absolutely infested with toxicity. The amount of smack-talk that goes down before and after the games, that I experienced anyway, definitely made me think twice about buying. There are obvious go-to characters from the get-go. A couple things I learned very quickly: Don't play the nurse. Don't play the wraith. Don't play the nerdy glasses guy. Don't play the speedy girl. There is no clear outline for new players to understand what the characters do, who they are, and how to use their special abilities. New players are absolutely shafted when it comes to learning how to play the game, and they are more of a detriment to their teammates than anything else. I think there needs to be some tutorial, as in, playable tutorial. That would be nice. Along with better descriptions of the playable characters, that way people can actually tell what they want, instead of being thrown into the dark as a scrub. It also feels as though survivors are too easy to track, too easy to hunt, and too easy to kill. Unless you have an actual group of team members talking over Discord or Skype, collaborating together, it's actually very difficult to get five generators running. Not to mention, the 'camping' issue. Now, I get it, the strategy is to let that person die and turn on generators while the killer is distracted.. but when he's camped three people and you're the only one left, it's hard to get another generator running.. Not to mention, the generators take forever alone. Perhaps a 'hurry-worry' mechanic would be nice if you end up being the last one alive... Admittedly despite these issues, I would have bought it, until I found out that it comes jam-packed with micro-transaction DLC -- which add more monsters and more survivors... which I feel may have negatively influenced my idea of possibly purchasing things. I would rather see a 'Season Pass' or a 'Deluxe Edition that actually features the DLC' sort of thing. I don't like paying for a game then paying more for that game in the form of smaller transactions that give mediocre things. Also the save-game thing.. thats pretty screwed up. The one where you take your friends save-game file and instantly end up with maxed out characters? That is.. sad. Honestly when I went to look up guides for the game, I found many 'Oh just download this save game it has all the things you need lololol' or 'Ask your friend for theirs.' sort of replies, instead of.. actually getting answers and tips on how to skillfully play the game and progress my own 'save game' Overall it is worth a try, I'm always a firm believer of 'Don't use reviews to judge how much you might enjoy a game!' but... unfortunately, it feels very unbalanced, and I ran into a few frustrating bugs... the community made it very tasteless for a PvP game... making this a thumbs down.",

All i'm really saying is don't support them constantly buffing killers and never buffing survivors, if I were the game designers I would buff survivor points to how they were before because they were never broken despite what most( and by most I mean salty crappy killers) will tell you. I would nurf killer lunge because killers can out run survivors plus lunge, like seriously there is no skill required when playing killer. Okay this next list is more specific but definitely needed. Buff Laurie Strodes Desicive strike to where the skill check is as big as seen in the trailer. Nurf Lunge because without the vaccum vaulting the lunge doesn't need to be that big. Fix hit boxes/survivors should not be able to receive damage on the opposite side of a window when vaulting and killer lunges, not saying that you can't receive damage WHILE vaulting, just not after. Lastly all I want to add is that I will personaly continue to play this game, even in this current state. You may ask 'Well you just left a negative review, and you're still going to play?' And the answer is yes, because i've already past the steam refund return policy.'Return a game with 2 hours or less and within' a week and you'll receive a full refund.' I'm just saying if I could personally go back and not buy this game I would. Also sorry I this is long but this is one of the most important part, THIS GAME TAKES A LOT TO RUN!!! I can't stress that enough, I have a I-7 core 2.5-3.1 gHz and the newest Nvidia drivers and graphics card (940MX), and still can barely run this game on a solid 30 fps on LOW! So don't read the requirements, they're way off on what you need to run this game, if you know for fact you think your pc is strong, get this game, just make sure to refund it. : ) hope this helps.",

I paid $20 for the game, when it was out of early access to find out that it has too many bugs to name. Right before I wrote this review I played a game and the killer was a bot (which they apparently fixed, by simply disabling macros for whatever reason), then I was disconnected from the game and I gained no points and lost my offering, how fun.   -Within 5 minutes of testing the Asylum map, I found multiple walls I could walk through, that were not fixed within two patches.  -Killers get host for whatever reason instead of getting dedicated servers, so I guess just ♥♥♥♥ the survivors and whatever they see on their screen. -Auto-aim is a thing, didn't know we were on console. -Nurse is stupid, it's like they didn't even attempt to test her.  -Infinites exist and they don't even try to fix it, then complain about it and ban people for using it, like 'Devin' in Admiral Bahroo's steam. -The lobby is awful, even after the new patch, I still can't find a game at all. -The settings/options menu is a complete joke, maybe let me put the settings exactly how I want them, seeing as how I paid for the game. -The game crashes a lot and I get stuck in the loading screen all the time (even after they said they fixed it). -The game is full of cheaters that go unpunished. -Many items/addons don't work the way they were intended to.  -Several animation bugs. -Many more things that make the game unfun/unplayable that you can read on forums or Reddit.   The fact that they charged $20, and then basically said 'this game that is filled with bugs and has no actual servers is the way we want it to be, let's take it out of early access because we are happy with our product' is completely insane. I will say though that the game can be fun and If they actually tested/fixed many things, the game will grow and actually be playable.",

Negatives - Queue system - You can only que as a solo 'Survivor'(join a Lobby) or 'Killer'(create a lobby) *so far I have been unable to play as the 'Killer' as the queue time's are insanely long multiple times I sat in a lobby as a killer watching people come and leave. - Hook campers - Though this may buy your team of randomers some time to escape by getting generators it leaves little room for fun if you are unfortunate enough to be caught early on, put on a hook only for the 'Killer' to stand infront of you until you die(which isn't that long really) There is literally nothing that can be done to stay alive or for anyone to rescue you if the 'killer' just stands in front of you. - interactables - again brilliant concept however sometimes they just screw you over, already in a short time many many times I've used the pallet to block the 'killer' only to have me on the wrong side of it whilst running through. - No queing as a party - This relates back to the first point but is important enough to be recognised seperately. You can only queue solo as survivor or create a private lobby to invite 4 friends, this means as a solo player you will wait in a lobby as people continuesly join and leave looking for their friends, it's beyond me how this was overlooked.   Positives. + Good soundtrack, the menu theme in particular scream 'TellTales - The Walking Dead'  + Fun with friends as per the many many youtubers videos of this with friends, it is inspired and great fun with pals + Visuals are decent for a low value game + Great feedback from the game with regards to staisfaction or escaping the 'killer' or openeing a Gate but staying behind to save that last guy.   Ultimately in my short time playing this game, and the videos I had watched on the game it IS a very good game and enjoyabel when you actually get in a game, it's greate to just play a couple game when bored or if your looking for something to do with friends,   Though due to the Queue system currently being poor 'It feels like there are only a few players on the game) I can't recommend it.",

            "review_text": "This is an amazing game!  So..... Why have i given a thumbs down?  Pro's first!  The dynamic of this game is brilliant. It gives you such an adrenaline rush and a feeling of real fear from the survivors perspective. You can feel your own hearbeat increase as your characters does when the killer is aproaching. I LOVE the fact the survivors are 3rd person and the killer is first. makes for some real funny moments when you manage to outsmart the killer when they are a meter away from you! PLaying as the killer turns you into a temporary psychopath and I love it. It is so fun to chase down the victims especially when they taunt you thinking they have the upper hand.   Now to the nitty gritty. CONS!  CAMPING HAS ALWAYS BEEN A PROBLEM! The devs reeeaaaaalllllllyyyyy need to make a way of preventing the killers camping their sacrifices because usually if they do this they kill at least 3 victims very easily and the 4th only gets away if they find the escape hatch! THIS IS SO FRUSTRATING!   There has been a bug since release that has had no update which prevents the killer picking up a survivor and therefore prevents them killing them! 4 versions in and still no sign of a fix. not good enough!  There are too many spots where the survirors can stand next to a window and hop from one side to the other infinitely so the killer cannot reach them in time. This can ruin your chances as a killer.   If a survivor leaves the game they lose their points but the killer gets some compensation and still has a chance to redeem points with the remaining survivors. If however the killer leaves the survivors get next to no points and drop rank. HOW IS THIS FAIR?!?! this should have been caught pre-release really.  The priorities and sense of achievement fall in the wrong place for the survivors. As a survivor you feel a sense of achievement on escaping the map. Unfortunately though this really means nothing. I have played a fair few matches in which all or most survivors escape yet no one has enough bloodpoints to rank up...... WTH???? Sure there is a 5000 point bonus for escaping and I think that is enough I just don't think the other actions as a survivor give enough bloodpoints to balance it. It just feels pretty crap to run out the exit dors a few feet ahead of the killer and not lose a rank. As the killer on average if I have managed 2 scrifices in a game I rank up 90% of the time (because I don't camp the hooks so people get unhooked a lot). As a survivor I have pretty much no chance of ranking up unless it was a particularly eventful round AND I escaped.  Optimisation at the moment is pretty crap. the graphics have fixed prsets making it difficult to identify culprits for framerate drops. also v-sync is default on unless you mess with config file. i did turn it of but the game runs VERY choppy without it and I assume this is why there is no official option to disable. I only get 30 fps on 1080P ultra on 2 systems that should be getting 75 (the refresh rate of my monitor) like ALL my other games get (bar some early access titles).  Finally, It can take a long time to get into the game as a survivor sometimes. it will often say 'failed to join a game' a few times and that I can deal with. The annoying occurence is how it often takes you to a loading screen after a long wait then chucks you back out. That gets frustrating after a few goes. all in all though I'm not to unhappy. compared to COD matmaking etc you get into games in a decent timescale 9 times out of 10 (I'd say within 30 seconds)  If you can deal with these issues, great game. I have played many hours of this game and will play many more. The issues are however begining to grate on me and the fact they have all been there since the beging and we have recieved no solid responses on them is the concerning factor. This is why I have chosen not to reccomend the game. Should this change I will happily change my review. ",

First things, a real pain in the ♥♥♥ to play with friends. The game makes it damn near impossible to group with a small group of friends and get into a game with other players. One of you can be the killer and create a lobby and invite the others, but you can't seem to open it to the public, however through some strange series of events that I couldn't recreate we did have one moment when strangers were suddenly already present in the lobby when I created it. This never happened again. Since a game like this seems the perfect match for playing with friends this is more than disappointing.   Secondly, everything about the general gameplay is either off the mark entirely or boring as hell. All the killers feel the same, they even seem to use the same attack animation, they move the same, attack the same, the only difference is one ability each that makes them at all unique, unless you 'level up' to get more options. So playing the murderer soon becomes boring and repetitive, no signature kills, no gory and amazing moments of slasher flick goodness here. Just whack em twice stick on a meat hook and watch em squirm, every time. The survivors gameplay is pretty much just a bland. Start generators run out exit, such diverse gameplay.   Finally, competition. WTF! Whose brilliant idea was it to take a rock solid idea for a fun, scary, dare I even say it, party game and vomit COD all over it. The forums for a game like this shouldn't be full of try hard neckbeards complaining about balance and leaderboards, but people comparing crazy fun experiences they had with their friends. Yeah it should be casual, it should be fun. No one wants to watch you people play your video games, you will not be famous, you will not be pro, especially not in a game like this.   The devs for this game seemed to have just totally missed the point in so many ways. They chose mundane oversimplified gameplay to promote competiiton and aid in balance rather than focusing on what would make a game like this a hit.

You get either 'Low', 'Medium', 'High', or 'Ultra'. That's it. Again, more basic options the game is missing.  - No option to queue with friends. If you want to play with friends, you have to have a full group of five, otherwise you're forced to play solo.  - No in-game voice. This becomes an issue when combined with my previous point. You'll probably be spending a lot of time playing solo since having five on all the time can be an issue. When playing solo you have no way to communicate or cooperate with other players. Yet another basic funtion that should be included but is somehow missing.  This is a full release. This isnt an early access title.

As the survivor there is very little you can do against the overpowered hunters. You get put on a hook and the hunter just stares at you while you struggle. This game is supposed to revolve around teamwork yet there is no teamchat or anyway to help a teammate that is being chased, attacked, or is on the hook if the hunter is in the area. This game is way too simple to mess up but somehow these developers did it, they ruined a game that has one aspect to it. Considering there is one type of game play you would think it would better and also not $20 for a garbage game. Please do not buy this game biggest waste of space on my hardrive. Added note, I got this for free and I still feel I need a $20 refund.",

This game has a lot of potential but it is extremely frustrating at the moment and needs to be balanced and debugged.  1. You cannot play with your friends in matchmaking.  2. Matchmaking is bugged and often does not work.   3. The Killer has a large advantage over the Survivors, which he should. However it is too significant. I began playing this game feeling suspense, punishment, and reward but soon later I was only met with frustration. The Killers speed (attack and movement) NEEDS TO BE NERFED in some way. I think realistc acceleration would make sense instead of the Killer being able to sprint in any direction at any time.   4.The odds of escaping the Killer are miniscule unless you want to spam jumping over the same window. I didn't pay $18 for that.   5. You will be punished for saving your teammates EVERYTIME. If the Killer has played more than 3 games they will camp hooked players. Saving them will result in your death along with theirs everytime. Don't save your teammates and you will be forced to take objectives by yourself, which will get you killed.  6. Last person alive? Oh just find the trap door or turn on the remaining generators (takes a lot of time) and get to the door (also takes time because doors are hard?) Also the trap door is anywhere. Near impossible to find. You will be found first.   7. You will be found and hurt within the first 30 seconds of the game half the time. How is that balanced?   8. Each killer needs to have ability cool downs. Hill billy runs around the map in seconds. Wraith can be invisible for as long as he wants. Trapper seems the most balanced but can place traps right under hooks which prevents saving. How is that fair if saving teammates is encouraged?  This game is NOT FUN to play as a survivor. Play as a killer and have a fun time squishing ants. I am extremely disappointed because I see the potential in this game but it too frustrating for suvivors even after multiple games and attempts.   In my experience you will either die immediatley or be alone and helpless for victory.   I have so many other suggestions and there are so many other issues I could address but I feel that my time would be wasted because there are so many issues and this will probably go unnoticed.  ",

Many restarts were had trying to fix this issue.  Second, the nurse is BROKEN. So OP that any half-competent killer can and will eliminate all the survivors. Her ability, blink, allows her not only to move faster than any given survivor but also to bypass any obstacles (INCLUDING WALLS) in her path. The survivor's main methods of slowing down the killer - pulling down barricades, hopping through windows, and navigating terrain - are all rendered useless since she can phase through them as though they weren't there at all. If the killer is the nurse and she catches your trail, the most you can hope to do is delay the inevitable.  Don't spend your money on this - it's more frustration than fun.",

At one point I was hiding behind a wall as the killer was getting close, then out of nowhere my location gets 'corrected' meaning I was moved no more than around 6-7 feet from them and in addition almost EVERY killer you go against will camp you until you die. Also if you want to play as the killer than you had better have another game on hand since I have to wait an average 40 MINUTES! I know this was just released but this should have been planned ahead. From what I can tell in the beta there weren't problems like this.",

I only recommend this game if you play as Killer...I'm not playing survivor anymore but will continue to play easy games of Killer until the balance comes back.  For reference...a Killer with no perks can easily kill all 4 survivors (especially as Michael Myers) and a Survivor without Sprint Burst will never survive a match.

Here's what i think in a format you gamers understand:  Pros: - Super fun when it works - In-depth progression system - That satisfying feeling when you get the perk you really want (My personal favorite is sprint burst) - Although not deep, you can customize the clothing of each survivor - Being the killer is super fun and satisfying  Cons: - The Nurse is really overpowered. At least in my opinion. - The Wraith doesn't get enough love:( - The occasional really bad lag spike - Match-making is god awful - The darkness when it consumes the stuff you want And the biggest con of them all: - The crashing This game has hard-crashed my computer not once, not twice, not three times, but SIX F#@KING TIMES!!

            "review_text": "Now I will admit, this game is an AMAZING concept for a multiplayer game. However with a bunch of issues at launch that is holding back this great game I really can't recommend it, and I will list why:  -Extremely buggy and laggy: maybe because of my terrible internet but this game has wierd bugs that can break the gameplay and cause some unfair advantages. And they better fix the netcoding for this game cause it is extremely laggy.  -Lobby issues: For some reason this 'multiplayer-only game', does not have dedicated lobbies. When you want to play as the killer you have to create a lobby instead of joining another lobby, and you have wait for SOOOO LONG to find players. Another issue is that you can't really invite your friends to a lobby before finding a match so you will joining and exiting a lobby often if you want to play with your friends. Therefore if you are the killer you will finally get survivors after waiting like 20 minutes and all of a sudden they instantly leave because they didn't find their friends... Now I don't know about you but that is one of the most infuriating things with multiplayer games!  -No mic chat: ya you heard me... in 2016 there is a multiplayer-only game that has no voice chat. So it kinda destroys any strategy for the survivors to help them win the game to out smart the killer so they better add this in a patch ASAP!  -Private matches: yes you can join your friends in a private match. HOWEVER, you won't be able to progress through your skill trees for your survivors and there is no leveling up.  Conclusion: This game is definitly an amazing idea for a fun multiplayer horror game! However its really being held back from being fun due to a lot of bugs, lobby issues, and the issues of not playing with your friends in ranked matches. This all can be fixed with patches and they better start bringing them out fast or the community will die out fast like Titanfall and Evolve. I will revisit this review when they fixed all the issues I talked about but for now, save your money and wait for this game to be patched.  Rating 3/10 ",

Now there are quite a few reasons I absolutely say Not to buy this game yet. Granted this game is fun and will be amazing given a few more months of polishing and bug fixing so lets get started. The rank system is broken at the moment you either win games and lose pips(every rank has a certain amount to need to reach before rank-up) or win games and don't gain pips or rank up at all even though the score screen shows you ranking up.  As for general gameplay the game is plagued with disconnect issues where you just randomly drop from the game doing whatever in the game, as well as sometimes the game seems to hiccup entirely and disconnect itself from steam and boot you out the game completely not allowing you to start the game up because it will auto boot you again saying steam is offline when it not and then you have to restart steam to get it to work again.  There are some game breaking bugs that have been said to the developer multiple times since beta began and still has not been fixed. The developers keep saying they are aware of it but give no issue to when a possible patch might fix any if at all some of the bugs that exist in the game. Also recently the game has encounter speed hackers it not many at the moment but when you do encounter them it sucks all the fun out the game.  The game has no chat support so it hard to communicate with other players to find out where the killer is or if your hooked to warn that the killer is camping them waiting for players to help their fellow players. The ranking system in the beta was too easy for people to rank up so they over nerfed it and made it brutal for every player to have a chance at ranking up even if you win you have a 50/50 chance of deranking because you didn't accumulate enough points to not derank.  With all the problems this game has 6 to 7 months down the line when everything fixed this game will be amazing. This game has some great moments when you 1st start playing as a survivor that get your heart pumping or fist pumping into the air because you made the most epic escape from a killer. It really give that do or die feeling in getting the objectives to escape and win. Honestly I really enjoy this game alot but the current state it's in lead me to say Don't Buy This at least not till it more stable.",

What I mean by this is that of course you will have an advantage by playing the game more, but in this game, the disadvantage is far too great to make it fun for a new player. -Toxic Community. Again, during my 3-4 hours played, I experienced some of the most hateful and mean people I've ever played with. Be prepared to be called,'baddie' or 'scrub' for simply not being a level 5+ character or above. -Leveling individual characters. I can understand leveling Killers and leveling survivors, but each character in each category? This is simply to add more of a grind feeling to the game and it actually distances me from the game. - Wait times as a Killer. I've tried the killer 3 times and it took me 10+ minutes for each time I played. This is unacceptable in a game released in 2016.  THE VERDICT:   While this game exemplifies some amazing and refreshing new gameplay, the problems with it's matchmaking and balancing simply make the game unenjoyable past the first hour of the game.",

Take advantage of their limited visability, sneak only when you need to otherwise run around like hell from place to place.   Really great heart pumping moments when you are trying to escape.  As the killer there is 0 stress involved as you literally have nothing to worry about (besides losing rank if you suck). However playing the killer lets you be brutal, taunt and punish survivors, and make them cower in fear. Beast moments as a killer is when you finally catch that little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that was taunting you and hook the ♥♥♥♥ right out of him.   Some people have complained about the cheese tactics of killers by picking up and dropping knocked down survivors. But if so many people didn't macro the wiggle it might not make killers resort to that. But I do think if a killer drops you, there should be some way for you to stand back up on your own. Especially if you spent the 2 mins holding the button only to get yourself a sliver of the way to standing up... All in all its pretty balanced, the ranking system is kind of harsh, but if you aren't scoring 10k points in a round consistently you are just not playing your character very well.   Don't die, or die trying.  **I've flip flopped on my review several times and it is again a NO because they continue to drop the ball when it comes to updates. 'Fixing' things that seemingly were not broken, then I submit bug reports via the email suggestion they gave, then after 1 week the sent a response to each report I sent saying they were not taking bug reports via this method anymore...  The game is fun but the devs are trash and think they can't fail. They STILL have yet to implement a party system which is utter trash as that was the #1 complaint in beta 3 weeks before launch and here we are almost 2 months later still no update... They continue to push updates that people don't care about and are probably going to try and milk out a dlc before the game fails because of their inability to gauge the publics response for what we actually want.",

I have 1 hour of gameplay, still I've been able to play only 1 match without getting this freaking error. How do you launch a game like this? You got at least make it playable. Also, the maps sucks. Most of the time the generatos are in places that has no windows to vault or obstacles to put in fornt of the killer. Another thing is the screaming when you get hurt. I understand that from time to time the survivors would have to do some sort of sound, just because they are hurt and to help the killer. But what is applied in the game is just too much. You'll be screaming like a ♥♥♥♥♥ in a brothel non stop and very loudly. Basically, if you get hit once, you're most likely getting hit twice.  TD:DR the game sucks.  — EDIT 20/06/16 —  — After finally getting over the 'steam offline' error, the game revealed to be great. I've only seen one glitch so far, where the killer hooked me, but i stayed on his shoulder flying around with him, and them people tried to save me, but i was still flying around with him, so i quited. The game is actually good, but it lacks explanation, specially on the bloodweb. For those who are starting now, in the level 7 or 8 you won't be able to get all the itens in the bloodweb anymore, and i had to ask other survivors to understand what happened. The game is good, and so far, being one of the survivors has proven much better than being the killer.  — EDIT 30/06/16 —  I've been addicted to this game, but honestly, the new patch 1.0.2 just ruined the game. They nerfed every survivor, while the killer keeps being as powerful as he already was. Not only that, now you get slower after vaulting something, so basically, you're no longer safe. If you get in the killers FoV, you are basically dead. They used the argumment that it was not fair to the killer, but for god sakes, the killer can go around the map with you on his shoulder with IG, he can one hit kill with No one scapes death, flashlight basically doesn't work at all, unless against wraith, where you can burn him. Really, they just messed up the game. I'm really dismotivated now, and this will kill the game pretty soon.  — EDIT 21/08/2016 — The game sucks again, devs are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, wraith still unbalanced, as well many of killers perks, which hasn't been nerfed, on the otherside, being a survivor is just asking to get frustrated.   — EDIT 14/11/2016 —  I've been playing since realese, and as much as i like to play as survivor, it became unberable. You have a killer with little (when you looking at myers) to no range at the heart beat, you have a killer (also myers) that doesn't need NOED. The Devs keep nerfing survivors, albeit killers are OP as ♥♥♥♥. Maybe if the plank boards took more time to break, or there were more of them, but right now, those wood planks are down right useless. Most time killers will charge the attack, what makes them sprint and attack. Many times you get the hit, even when you stun the killer. Maybe making it larger would solve the problem? Or maybe removing the charged attack, forcing killers to make decisive strikes. After making to rank 1 and prestigng, i see no point what so ever trying to play as a survivor anymore. Is just not fun. At first, is terrifying and fun. But the Hook camping, the bugged interections that will make your character 1- Ignore the trap; 2 - Interection not appearing. That's serious, many times i just stood there, unable to interact to take my partner out of the hook.  It seems that the generators are getting fixed even more slowly when alone. Myers and Wraith straight down ruins the mechanics of the game. Unless you have a flashlight to counter wraith, be prepared. Removing the infinites. Ok, so pretty much every map had one, JUST ONE spot where you would be pretty much safe, unless you got juked. You'd only have 1 generator there, and that's about it. Not only these infinites doesn't exist anymore, but many of these maps became impossible to scape once in sight. Sure, you can try to run in circles, stun, and etc, but hardly ever a good killer will lose his dinner. I saw no other choice other than playing with the killer. It's not that i think that it's not fun, it's just not as fun as being the survivor (used to be, anyways).  Sure, i got my fun out of the price of the game, but is just not right anymore.   SHOULD YOU BUY IT? No, don't buy it. Wait for Devs stopping being ret4rd3d killerf4g5, maybe they''ll even balance the game one day. Untill this day, watch streams or wait for a steam sale.",

Mistake.  I'm not a good enough killer to be affected by the changes that everyone is on fire about but even at my low level one thing that shows up is the matchmaking. Here’s a tip to the developers: just because you reset someone’s rank back to 20 or 15 does NOT mean they play at that level, so basing your matchmaking on someone’s rank is a massive logic bug. I get dumped into games where it’s clearly former rank 1 survivors (going by the vast array of level 3, rare perks they have—well okay not vast array it’s always the same 3 perks) and here I am with my 1 perk, low level billy/nurse. Maybe there just isn’t enough players to do correct matchmaking. I don’t know, I don’t care, it’s still broken.  Even though I’m 15 hours in I’m still gonna try for a refund. Worst case they say “no”, best case I get the $20 I wasted back. Worth it. EDIT: Spoiler alert. Didn't get the refund. Guess I'll wait and see if anything changes in the next patch.   Tl;dr Good idea, executed meh. Matchmaking is straight cancer. Devs need to run servers instead of P2P (didn’t go into it but going the cheap route was a mistake on their part). If it’s on sale for $10 then maybe (yuge maybe though, the size of the yugeness… large) anything more and it’s way overpriced.  EDIT: I gave it a few more hours after the hotfix. The matchmaking still sucks. If you want to drop a few dozen hours before it's even remotely fun, congrats you're a Twitch streamer, otherwise skip the game.",

I get wonderful games when I do, nobody dcs everyone is having a good old time. Unfortunately, the sole determination as to who you are matched against is rank - not your character's level. So once you start winning some games as a killer, it will begin to match you with people with maxed out survivor levels making it nigh impossible to ever catch and find them. I'm not sure why this game needs a ranked matchmaking system, it is certainly not a very competitive game insofar as being considered an esport. So many lame mechanics that people can abuse. Just another way esport/twitch are fundamentally ruining potentially wonderful games by making developers feel like they need to make their games 'esport MLG competitive.'

            "review_text": "EDIT: To add another negative I recently found out this game is rampent with people swapping save files to unlock all the perks and items. Also botting has become more rampent in the game. At fisrt I thought the game was unbalanced because of pure balancing issues in the game. However, I now know it's because people are actually cheating and sharing these save files. The devs need to work on ways to stop these botters and cheaters and maybe it will be better. More than likely I will still play the game because I do still find enjoyment out of it every now and then. But I do think you should work to improve your toons in the game and not just swap to a completed save file.   A great game with a few issues! Overall the game is great and is one of the best survival type multiplayer games out there. Matches are never too long so it's great for players who have limited time to play every day. The game is not too graphics intensive so lower to mid-range should be able to play for the most part. After a while the killer is no longer scary but the gameplay keeps you on your toes and the adrenaline pumping regardless so this doesn't matter. Take note however, there are a lot of cons to the game right now and a lot of bugs that need to be ironed out. Balancing is still a large issue and sometimes the maps feel small when the killer can run so fast. However, with its growing popularity the developers seem to be listening to the community and trying to improve the game even without the promised weekly updates. Below I have listed some current cons to the game as well as bugs my friends and I have encountered.  One of the biggest issues at the moment is the game is very much in the killer’s favor: -Killer can see survivors ranks and levels and just leave -If the killer has iron grasp it won't matter if you get rid of all the hooks you can't wiggle out -It the killer has a memento mori you will more than likely lose the game -If you disconnect the killer gets points, if the killer disconnects you get nothing -The killer is the host of the game so if he lags, you all lag, and lag switches seem to be a rampet issue -If the killer has No One Escapes Death then forget opening gates unless at least two of you are alive and even then you risk death (Yes I understand the killer needs some advantages because he is in first person and therefore as a smaller field of view, but some of the killer’s current perks are just very overpowered. Note: Some of these perks are due to be nerfed soon!)  The game also has a lot of bugs: -Sometimes you throw a pallet down and end up on the wrong side -You will try and vault a window and end up looking like you climb a wall -You can get stuck inside hooks after being saved or even stuck in the ground -You will get downed and get glitched to where your teammates can't heal you and the killer cannot pick you up  Matchmaking is terrible: -As stated earlier the killer will leave if the survivors are too high rank waiting for lower ranks -Sometimes a group of 4 rank 18-20 survivors will get matched with a rank 1 killer -Good luck finding games sometimes in survive with friends -You don't stay in a que but instead have to constantly ready up (Ready Sim 2016: you will spend 30% of the game just trying to find a match 45% if you're playing survive with friends)",

I guess it won't see mainstream success until it's ported to consoles.The devs listen to the players and are constantly updating and fixing things. They even do a weekly twitch stream talking about the game. I also love that every new killer introduced changes the rules, forcing players to adapt. While the game has it's share of bugs and feels like an early access it is still very playable.   I can no longer recommend this game as it is nearly unplayable for the following reasons:  1. Endless loading screen (most that force you to quit the game losing items, add-ons and offerings)  2. Extended loading screens that take so long 1-3 players have left leaving you for dead (and wasting items, addons, and offerings again)  3. Survive With Friends. This game was built as a non traditional co-op game, but then one was poorly rushed out breaking everything in the process. Not only is SWF the root of all the current loading issues, but almost everyone using it cheats by communicating via skype, discord, etc making it completely unfair for the killer. There is no way to opt out of this mode. It has been forced upon everyone that plays the game.",

Fixing the generators were hard and obviously it's just me i know, but what i noticed is that 2 times i got a great skill check even though the line wasn't anywhere close to the place in where i had to stop it at in order not to end up making a loud bang and the killer will end up killing me. If you want to survive, you better hope you have teamates willing to help others and the most important part, pray to god that the killer won't camp the survivor because then you're screwed and your teamates will either save you and you still get caught by the killer and put back on the hook, your teamate ends up getting caught and put on the hook or both of you manage to escape. Did i mention a 4th outcome? No?

            "review_text": "  Before i get into it, my buddy bought this game because i refused to even check it out.  I dont write alot of reviews, but I can't help write a review for this because I feel people should know what they're getting into before buying. I'll try to keep this as short and simple as i can: This is an extremely addictive and ridiculously fun to play game but it suffers from a lot of issues that moslty stem from unresovled bug issues, laggy killers/survivors, poor map design, and the fact that anyone and their mom can cheat.   1. The cheat engine is a joke and ppl can easily get around it resulting in speedhacking survivors/killers with ESP who can see everyone on the map with boxes highlighting them. Seriously go look at youtube for a second and find some dead by daylight hacks. Its downright damning to anyone who wants to play the game without cheating or without said cheaters. I have read its best to report them on steam when u find a suspected hacker. Also, dont forget the lag can cause it to look like the survivor or killer is lag swithcing or speedhacking so its best to just report suspcted cheating and let steam deal with it.  2.This game has p2p host, introduce laggy killers and survivors who seem to warp around the map, a dedicated server or servers would solve this issue but i would not expect that to happen anytime soon. Until that happens or if it never does you are at the mercy of your killer's ping most of the time. Also, going back to the first point, the p2p+easy anticheat= anyone can cheat without getting caught.  3.Balancing has been an issue since launch and will continue to be so as long as they keep making unneccesarry nerfs and buffs to the wrong things instead of fixing the real issue at hand. In case a dev reads, my advice is to make a tier system and put perks into tiers where u can only have one perk from each teir and put perks like Self care and Sprint burst in the same tier. Do the same with Save The Best For Last and Unrelentless on the killer side. This will break up the pallete camping and machine gun builds that players are abusing atm. Just Food For Thought.  4.Prob the biggest issue I would like to address has nothign to do with the game itself oddly. And welcome the community is toxic AF rant. Bring a thick skin to the party bc the salt is strong in the post game lobby. From both sides its getting really bad. Looking at the profiles of other players has become a regular chore before starting a match and what i have found is that DBD has inhertied one of the most toxic gaming communities of all time, looking at you CSGO. Yes alot of the players you will find on DBD are also the same trolls from one of the worse communities ever known to gaming. On top of all that SWF(survive with friends) groups will use discord to gaing the upper hand agaisnt the killer and then talk mad ♥♥♥♥ in the post lobby. If you plan to play with friends on discord know that it takes most of the difficulty out of the game and is pretty much the equivalent to neutering the killer. I do not know why this is a feature that does not have its own mode. SWF should not be allowed in ranked matches imo. Just simply make a third mode thats a mix beteen play with friends and ranked matches and let it have its own rankings. This way a killer can play a mode where not every match is a match against high ranking 4 man groups who basically ♥♥♥♥ on the killer bc of OP perk combos and communication. If you play a round against 4 people on discord all using decisive strike sprint burst and self heal then you will understand.   Summary: Dead by Daylight is a fun and addictive game with a lot of issues such as OP perk combinations, a basically non existant anticheat engine, a toxic community, no dedicated servers, the very broken SWF feature, and much much more.   I really want to recommend this game but I cant in all good conscience recommend it due to all the issues it has atm. I may come back and change my review if they continue to keep up with the banning of cheaters and fixing the various bugs, or maybe fix most of this game by adding dedicated server so each game doesnt become check each survivors' and killers' profile to see where they live and then dodge lobby when u find out they live all the way across the world.   Last Note: I still have to admit i continue to play this game and i continue to love and hate it all at the same time.",

            "review_text": "It would be a good game, however as a beginner player(having played 20-50 games so far, and survived twice) they make it extremely difficult by pairing us with experienced killers with rare/very rare perks. I do admit that I would rather have it be a challenge, but the fact that the killer has a 95-98% winrate it just doesn't seem worth trying to grind up the bloodpoints to be anywhere good(My friends and I are between level 10-20) each with out survivors meant to do the specifics that they are meant for such as healing/teamwork/fixing generators. The other downside would be the Host, As such Dead by daylights creators dont have a dedicated server that we connect to, and rather have the killer host the games which leave a huge impact in terms of delay upon repairing generators to escaping all the way to heal checks.",

            "review_text": "  Fun game, a bit unbalanced - but still fun. Alot of work still needs to be done before I spend the amount being asked.   1. Lobby (should be able to switch between killer and survivor before commencing game) 2. Stable - So many disconnects and game crashes. 3. Starting a game - Be a survivor, Be a Killer, Quick Play, Play with Friends - really don't make sense. Just have 'join a game' and play with friends. Then a lobby to sort out who wants to be what. Simple. 4. Perk and lvling system seems pointless - just reward us with the items instead of making us go and click on them, cause the 'tech trees' all have to be clicked on to lvl up anyway... what's the point? there is none. 5. Being hooked - needs improvement, as it's so hard to get away from being hooked. Especially when there is a killer camping. Seems too easy.  Overall - love the concept, it's terrifying and brings alot of laughs with friends. Make it a stable, smoother experience and i'd pay the money to add this to my steam list. It's just not there yet. Happy I got a chance to try it out over the free weekend though. I'll be monitoring this game for updates. Rated 'No' for not yet.",

Way to many menu and loading screen freezes. Frustrates the hellout of someone. Seriously, If you want to play a ten minute game, It can take 25 minutes to get there. Im guessing about 50% of my game time has been spent batteling their crap menus. The menus fuctions just go unresponsice ALL THE TIME. Almost every round requires me to ALT+F4 the application and rrestart it. Its pretty sad when you open task manager when you start the gamejust so you can quickly close it when you have to. It's totally pathetic that the dev's havent fixed the simple menu/connection glitches. That at least has to run smooth. Gameplay dont Fing matter if you can't get there.",

High Level Killers With 4 Perks Imbalance - No Full Screen Mode - so you can accidentally click outside your screen  Verdict:  - The game is somewhat beta-ish but gradually getting better as patches get implemented if devs ever care!!",
