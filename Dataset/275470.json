I have now managed to unlock all levels and unlock all but the last one of the wardrobe items.   It's a fun game and it got me totally hooked. Solving the puzzles within the time limit is hard, and it has taken me a lot of tries, giving up on a puzzle and coming back the next day to try again. What really sets this one apart from many other timed puzzle games is that I don't mind trying and trying again until I get there.",

Biggest issue I have with Chip is that it often takes more than one click to detect an action, and that can be a problem in a game that requires speed. Do I recommend it? I'm stuck between Yes and No but unfortunately Steam knows only 0 and 1. This is a strictly subjective review. Try it out and see if you like it - on sale it can be bought for under 1€ and you might enjoy it. ",

Don't get me wrong - there are enough levels to justify buying the game. My playtime for this game reflects playing through and completing levels, as well as achievements, if you want to gauge how long you'll probably play this.  There is a lot of room for expansion and additions - all the framework is there to build this game up. Unfortunately for the game and the players, the final bonus levels are where the puzzles get very interesting, which would allow for some pretty cool combinations. If it didn't abruptly end. Despite a lack of strong story or narrative (there is a basic story, but it's not an important theme), the game felt like it ended on a cliffhanger.  This is one of the few games in my library that deserved more attention from Steam users than it received, and would be a great addition to your library if you like puzzles.",

Even after having solved the puzzle mentally, it often took 6-10 attempts to actually complete the level because of timing and controls are very unforgiving. I hoped the second set of puzzles that unlocked would have more interesting puzzles, nope, more of the same ridiculously timing-driven object manipulation. It feels less of a puzzle game and more of a finicky 'platformer' having to perfectly jump in or jump out of the path of a moving object.",

The game is quite repitive but has many many levels.  There are even other chatacters but they are just for decoration (like the first one) there is even a girl robot - (for the people that has never seen a girl before, you should use this one).  the puzzle is ok - but you just have to like it i guess.  i will give this a neutral rating and it is a 5/10",

It seems like between these mobile-port style puzzle games, 2D retro platformers and RPGMaker shovelware there is not much else releasing regularly on Steam. Chip works just fine, it has some cool twists in mechanics and has a nice amount of difficulty in later levels. However, this sentiment could be copy/pasted for just about any of these puzzle games and it really doesn’t do anything special to stand out from the crowd. If you enjoy these kinds of games, Chip works, but it’s really nothing I would recommend to a friend.",
