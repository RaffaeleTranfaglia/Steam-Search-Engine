            "review_text": "SNAPSHOT A forgettably repetitive top-down game where you mash the attack button to kill the same enemies over and over again.  OVERALL - 4 / 10  PROS + a dozen or so different weapons that all play differently from each other + decent art  CONS - extremely repetitive, gets old very fast - constant progress 'resets'  DETAILS First off, I am honestly surprised that people have been giving this game good reviews. Either people reviewing it haven't played other games, ever, or they just really like running in circles mashing one button for about 20 minutes.  While this game looks like a poor man's Binding of Isaac, it plays even worse. The game puts you in sequential rooms that spawn ~3 different types of enemies per room, with the goal being to kill all enemies in order to repeat the same process again. Each enemy has one attack (save for the few bosses in the game) and drop one type of weapon (e.g. the skeleton drops a sword). You'll spend a minute or two clearing out the slowly spawning enemies, which when finished will open a door on one side of the room (although seeing as how each level is entirely linear, this serves no purpose except to change your starting point for the next room).  While fighting, players increase xp and a combo meter when they kill enemies. The purposes of these mechanics seem to be a good idea at first, except for the fact that losing the combo meter leads to draining xp from the player (eventually de-leveling them), which then causes enemies to die even slower than they did before. The higher level the player is, the faster the combo meter decays (and thus, eventually, their level), and even when a player is ahead of the curve and as maxed out as they can be with upgrades, enemies at best are still frustratingly alive with a sliver of health after a set of attacks. At worst the player has to follow an enemy for several boring seconds holding the attack button until it begrudgingly decided to die.  If a player gets behind the power curve, it becomes increasingly difficult to catch back up and ends up being a painfully slow demise. Normally this is not a problem (and the player loses all their HP before this happens), however when a bosses is defeated for the first time it essentially resets the players progress as enemies have more hp that seems to magically even out once the player upgrades their weapons again. While normally I find progression systems fun, this one just ends up feeling like someone constantly struggling to reach the surface level of water with an increasing amount of baggage instead of say, acquiring a jet ski and then a speedboat.  Every once in a while a room will contain a 'buff' for enemies (which consisted of more / less monster hp. faster movement / attack, or perpetually spawning slime enemies that were killed in one hit) or a chest will spawn with a heart and potentially a ~30s player buff. This is probably the biggest excitement you will have all game, unless you really enjoy killing enemies progressively slower.  In essence, the game ends up forcing the player to quit / die after beating every boss unless they want to spend 30 minutes clearing a single room in a floor. This, combined with the already mediocre-at-best combat and repetitive nature of rooms, makes this game not worth playing, even with a refund. What little story there is doesn't even remotely make up for the lackluster and repetitive (have I mentioned this game is repetitive?) nature of the game.",
