            "review_text": "Wolfenstein: The Old Blood is a 2015 standalone prequel and expansion to the critically acclaimed and underrated game, Wolfenstein: The New Order (2014). A solid and terrific first-person shooter at its own right, The Old Blood doesn’t change much from The New Order in regards to gameplay mechanics. However, I personally enjoyed the gameplay mechanics even though it is, obviously, recycled from The New Order. The review applies to people who never played MachineGames’ vision of Wolfenstein or people who already had The New Order on the Steam Library. The question remains: Should I get The Old Blood and why?  The Old Blood takes place in Castle Wolfenstein (yes, literally) around 1946. The Nazis are winning the war over the Allies and you must stop them from declaring decisive victory. You play as William “B.J” Blazkowicz, an OSS agent who must infiltrate the Castle to gather intelligence on Deathshead’s Compound (where your arch nemesis resides) and assassinate him. Interestingly, the Old Blood takes place just before the prologue chapter in The New Order. There are interesting characters in The Old Blood, including notables such as Helga Von Schabbs and notable references from previous Wolfenstein titles. The story is pretty good and has great homage to Return to Castle Wolfenstein (2002) and the developers respectfully placed references that old school gamers would recognized.   The gameplay is simple: shoot and kill Nazis. That’s it. Nothing else. This may sound so typical for a first-person school and it is, but every Nazi you kill feels very satisfying. The weapons and character movement are great and highly outstanding. The walkthrough would last you around 4-6 hours, but there are some replay values on getting achievements or finding secrets. The best part in The Old Blood is revisiting Wolfenstein 3D by sleeping on a bed (which the beds are in secret areas). Finding the secrets will bring you great rewards and nostalgia. Alongside with the storyline to fulfill MachineGames’ lore on Wolfenstein, Old Blood offers “Challenge Mode” (or challenge maps) and it is really great. Kill the Nazis and accumulate points on reaching certain criteria for bronze, silver, or gold.   While The Old Blood has great merits, there are some negative attributes that has to be taken in consideration. First, the content doesn’t seem much but the storage requirements is insanely huge (all thanks to the iD Tech 5 engine), taking around 38 GB of your hard drive or SSD. This is roughly the same storage space as The New Order, but has fewer content. Individuals who have poor internet connection or low download speeds will have to exercise caution on installing and downloading the game (and wait for hours). The game engine is pretty and impressive, but the engine suffers frequent popup textures or objects were blurry and takes a few seconds to adjust itself to its proper graphical design. In my experience, this happens more often in The Old Blood than The New Order.   The Old Blood (standalone expansion/DLC) is outstanding and I really enjoy it. Even though there are many similarities for The New Order, there are some games that shouldn’t change gameplay mechanics and The Old Blood is one of those games. Game reviewers or critics gave The Old Blood some solid reviews (or “mixed” with many won’t recommend the “full price”). In my personal point of view, The Old Blood is absolutely worth $20 or your regional equivalent. MachineGames broke off the common trend of expensive DLCs (with little content) and gave a full fledge expansion that is reasonably priced and justified. I commend the developers for making the right choice. For those who have The New Order, but didn’t get The Old Blood, I strongly encourage you to get the game. For the gamers who have not experience Wolfenstein, get The Old Blood first for the story, then get The New Order. The Old Blood is my personal favorite for 2015 as one of the best expansion (or “DLC”) to the well-established, 2014 game – The New Order. On a good discount or full price, this standalone expansion is worth your money. Without a doubt.",

I didn't get bored, what issues most people had with The New Order were fixed here. It is basically less cinematic, more action oriented. Story is still there, but it happens as you shoot your way through it (besides, maybe the prologue). The game has few technical problems because of it's engine, but after creating a folder that the game didn't make, everything were smooth on max settings, very well optimized, but not as pretty as some might want. Still, loads of fun! 9/10 from me. If you are not Wolfenstein franchise fan, you might give it less, but you sure should at least try it! In my opinion, better than the original New Order, but they should be bought and played together (in whatever order).",

Actually, I can't find anything to complain about.   Just like the last game, the New Order, this is almost the same rundown. Same kind of gameplay and what not. Not much difference with the last game. It's more like an extended version maybe? OH YA, there are zombies in it! And some of the scenery was a bit creepy to play in. I guess the developers took a look at Zombie Army Trilogy series.   Action pretty much within the first 5 minutes of the game. So again, no long tedious intro. But you don't start with all the cool weapons, right off the bat, but you get them early in the game as well.   I would have loved to seen a pistol only achievement in this game, or at least a handful of areas where you can collect stealth achievements on. I really liked the silenced pistol. Powerful and can almost snipe with it if you are good enough.  So there you have it people. I would love to see the next installment, and hopefully add some different variances to the game. After all, if they made the same thing again, it would only become redundant.",

I think they are relying on the carryover from TNO for you to invest in BJ and his enemies, but as an prequel-expansion it is superb for the price. Do yourself a favor and go exploring, read the letters, they really make a difference in how much of the story is communicated as the audio narrative is much shorter.  It feels like the player has more choices to go stealth instead of guns blazing most of the time, a solid addition. AI is still a bit wonky, pay attention to their verbal cues as they may not have seen you(even though you'd be dead to rights in any other game). If you loved TNO, pick this up.

I love history and couldn't resist seeing what Wolfenstein: TOB would be like - And upon playing it, I was left speechless and blown away, more satisfied with a game experience than I ever have been before.   -   STORYLINE  - 10/10  No words can describe how beautiful the storyline is. It is so hard not to get attached to the characters, as their struggles are so humanly raw and real that you can't help but care with every ounce of your being, if not some small albeit meaningful part of your heart.   I cried when Wesley died; I was really determined to save him. You have no idea.     **Wolfenstein: The Old Blood progresses in 'chapters' that are well paced and helps give the game an organized feel. At any time you can go back on previously finished chapters and replay it, allowing limitless time to search for collectibles or just enjoy it all over again.    GAMEPLAY  - 8/10  Gameplay is exciting and rarely ever begins to feel repetitive. You can approach a situation through stealth or run in unabashed. There is a decent selection of weapons at your disposal, all very useful and effective in combat.   Adjusting game difficulty is easy should newer gamers start to feel overwhelmed. Advanced players will be happy to find that the harder settings are actually hard and do provide a refreshing challenge.  --------------------------------- There are 6 levels of difficulty:   CAN I PLAY, DADDY?  =  Very easy.    DON'T HURT ME  =  More difficult than the last level, damage from enemies has a higher impact on health and armor, demanding that the player think more on their feet while still leaving a gap of leniency for those still under experienced with FPS.    BRING 'EM ON!  =  This is the default or Normal difficulty. A comfortable middle.    I AM DEATH INCARNATE!  =  A nice challenge for those who enjoy FPS. Leniency for errors is almost non-exsistant.     ÜBER  =  Very hard.    MEIN LEBEN  =  You have one life. Die once, the game is over. All of your weapons become your lifeline, you rely totally on your skill to make it through.  ---------------------------------    SOUNDTRACK  - 10/10  The soundtracks send shivers down my spine and helps with immersion in a unique way. Somber, quick, or intense notes help to seal in the atmosphere of loss and bloody, sweaty determination of one man against impossible odds.      OVERALL - I highly recommend Wolfenstein: The Old Blood. It hasn't dissapointed me in any way, and while that may only be true for me personally, there's no denying this is an amazing game.  ",

It's Wolfenstein done right, and I played many Wolfensteins. 1946 setting of the game (which we catched a glimpse in Prolouge in TNO) is very nice. You have those retro-futurisctic WWII weapons, by which you kill retro-futuristic nazi troopers, ubersoldaten und zombies. Weapons themselves feel powerfull and gunplay is just like in TNO, but smoother. The story is well presented and there are some interesting characters, thou sometimes I felt the story wanted to be something more emotional but played out... wierd... funny... IDK, maybe you'll get that while playing. And you should play it. I even recommend playing it before TNO (if you haven't been playing it). The game took me 10 hours to beat (67 % completion of game, so I guess there's still couple of hours to grind). Just like in TNO you have kilograms of gold to find, letters, secret areas (some neaty easter-eggs await you ;D). Another good thing is that there's less interactive cutscenes, more mowing down (or sneaking on) nazis, something which I did not like in TNO. There is nice addition of Challenges, in which you replay some big fights, but you get timer, points and combos, so the game may keep you for a while longer. It's also a very stable launch. I have never encountered any crashes or bugs, no framerate drops on medium-high settings even while shooting hordes of enemies. Overall Machinegames again gave us a great grame to experience and I think Wolfenstein franchise is in good hands.  GG Machinegames.   Talking about GG's. I think it's time for multiplayer Wolf?",

I'm talking about the fact the The Old Blood is an expansion like Blue Shift and Opposing Force were to Half-Life. It is well written, full of action and a complete addon to the original game. This is how downloadable content should be presented. The Old Blood, like The New Order, presents old fashion shooting with today's graphics. The gameplay is engaging, dynamic and never once did I feel bored. I think I might actually like The Old Blood more as it leans towards the paranormal side of the Wolfenstein franchise like Return to Castle Wolfenstein did, and that makes it such a good game. That is what The New Order missed in my opinion. The only con is the IDTech engine, well its graphics mostly. The game looks gorgeous but this texture thing while making swift turns breaks the immersion a bit. Otherwise I like the engine and works well for shooters such as these. It makes me look forward towards Doom 4.",

            "review_text": "If you played Wolfenstien: The New Order, you pretty much know what to expect. However, for those unfamiliar with it, playing TNO isn't mandatory since it's a prequel.   The game is a FPS, that takes place during WWII along an alternate timeline, where the Nazis have perfected robotics, cybernetics and weapon-tech. Meaning you will find yourself battling robotic super soldiers, cyborgs and well equipped soldiers eager to tear your head off.  While the game is a FPS, it does have many stealth elements. Sure, you can run in guns blazing and possibly survive. However the safer, and in my opinion way more fulfilling, is stealthing your way through certain locations. Why blast a heavily armored super soldier when you can sneak through some air ducts and get behind him to shut off his power? Why run through a kennel and battle cyborg dogs when you can sneak up to them while they sleep and silence them quickly?   No matter which route you go, if you are a fan of W:TNO, or FPS games in general you will probably love this game. It's not without it's faults though which I will list below, but first allow me to tell you what it does well.   Pros",

A ridiculous FPS with exploding heads and bad dialogue? Then yes!  It doesn't take itself seriously, has great stealth play if you're interested (which I am) and is generally all the madness one would expect from Wolfenstein game. Throwing in some sort of zoophile Nazi on top of all that makes for an explosive experience.  The cons are quite substantial but if you can get over them, there is a great game to be had. So... the cons... 1)TOO EASY - waaaaaay too easy. Played through Uber first time and can't say I was ever challenged. I'm not that great at FP Shooters either, so I think if you're decent you could play with your eyes closed. 2) Boring perks - no specialisation and very little motivation to go and work through them. They mayaswell have given certain sets of perks at certain milestones in the game. 3) Short campaign - It played for what felt 1/4 of the time New Order did, and when I completed it I was surprised it was the end, rather than expecting it.  4) Boring story.  This game could be seen as New Order: Redux and dismissed for that reason. I however, found it a lot of fun and think that for the price (especially in the sale), think that it is a worthwhile purchase. ",

            "review_text": "Wolfenstein: The Old Blood is one hell of an interesting expansion to its core game, The New Order. For those of you wondering, despite being a standalone game, The Old Blood does lead directly into The New Order, and given the oppurtunity I would absolutely recommend playing through The Old Blood first.  The Old Blood is an 8 chapter expansion that is suprisingly lengthy. My first playthrough took around 8 hours total to beat, though my second run took about half that time. During development, MachineGames took two individual ideas they had for expansion content, and combined them into one, giving us the two parts of The Old Blood: 'Rudi Jager and The Den of Wolves' and 'The Dark Secrets of Helga Von Schabbs'. The first part is by far the more standard of the two, whilst the second part veers into the occult elements that were amiss in The New Order for the most part.  Gameplay-wise, you're getting pretty much the exact same core mechanics, expect with a technical downgrade. As the game takes place 10 years prior to The New Order, BJ Blazkowicz has a significantly more aged arsenal to utilize. Thankfully, it's pretty much just as effective, and features some interesting additions such as a bolt-action sniper rifle, a grenade pistol, and optional dual-wielded pipes. Combat is arguably tougher then The New Order, as BJ is more restricted in how effectively he can tackle opponents, though it's still as fluid and enjoyable as it was in The New Order.  The Old Blood suffers most in the story and visual design elements. Don't get me wrong, the game looks fantastic and provides a number of beautiful vistas that double as challenging levels, however the level of environmental storytelling has decreased significantly. As has the effectiveness of the story. If The New Order told a fantastic story, The Old Blood tells one with similiar ambitions, but it's restricted in its length. Characters here still possess a similiar amount of notable traits and witty and passionate dialogue, the problem is there really isn't enough in it to truly engage the player. I only found the game getting particularly heavy at the very end, during the transition into The New Order.   Despite it's somewhat crammed and less effective story however, I still recommend it as a precursor to The New Order. The combat and overall flow of the game is excellent, and very reasonably priced for several hours worth of content. If you enjoyed The New Order, you'll likely just as much enjoy what's on offer here.",

First of all, I would like to say that The New Order and The Old Blood has easily made their way into my top 10 games. This is what I would call SOLID games.   Here's what The Old Blood has to offer: - Unlockable Perks - Challenge Mode - Collectibles - A few new guns - New characters - Old characters - Nightmare levels - Backstory  The two games play exactly the same, with one or two elements changed or added. Playing The Old Blood made me long for The New Order. This is because the game lacks story depth and character developement, but I suppose it's only fair since it's a DLC. It's certainly not as well versed as The New Order, but it's one of the best DLCs I have ever experienced. Most DLCs just feels like add-on content that should have been in the game but wasn't because it was unfinished. I would recommend playing the prequel first if you are looking for chronological order, but playing it second has a bunch of perks as well.   Bottom line: If you loved The New Order, you will most probably love The Old Blood as well!",

You once again play as Blazcowicz as you try to infiltrate the infamous 'Castle Wolfenstein' in search of intel on the nazi war machine. I think that its a little better than the new order, because its very fast paced. The thing I did not like is the fact they abuse stealth sequences, I mean you can either take that aproach or go completely 'Rambo-mode',but the fact is that they sometimes force you to be stealth or you have to restart the level and it gets plain annoying (unless playing on mein leben difficulty). The fact is that some enemies are not meant for stealth sequences. Like the shotgunner for example. Shotgun soldiers are a great idea in FPS games so it makes you feel that your not the only one using a shotgun. I see it in HL2 with combine shotgun soldiers for example, but this is where they screw it up: THEY GIVE THEM TO MUCH HP!!! IT MAKES THEM A PAIN TO DEAL WITH, plus you can't do a take down on them which really sucks, plus in my eyes the shotgun soldiers look more like the pyro from tf2 then shotgun soldiers. Here is something with the AI that sucks too (Well of course Bethesda made this so the AI is going to suck), When you are sneaking around and you are right in an enemy's field of vision they just sit there and act like you do not exist. HOW UNREALISTIC IS THAT... Word of advice to Bethesda: Improve your AI. Surprisingly though, because its a bethesda game I expected it to be like Fallout 4 and have tons of bugs and glitches, but instead the only bug I came across was a 'Panzerhund' not attacking me and standing still. Otherwise it was a smooth playthrough and I expirienced no bugs or glitches. Good work on that devs. Combat like the new order is still very, very smooth which makes it easy. I like FPS games with smooth gunplay, plus just like new order the muzzle effects and recoil of your gun seems so real. Its feels as if you are actually shooting it. Which I enjoy the realism. The game also included a bunch of minigames which made you find other routes to the end of the level in a set amount of time which gives the player a challenge to have them beat other players in these minigames, and I like that idea. There are and abundance of easter eggs too, like a skyrim helmet, doom plush toy, and much, much more! The weapons are nice as well. The minute I kill one of those murder bots. I pick up his weapon and I'm like: 'MG-42 MINIGUN!!! SWEET!!!' the assault rifle is a pimped out STG44, and  there is a jacked up Kar98k. The weapons were awesome and made me guess what real life ww2 weapons they could have originated from. One of the weapons I really like is the lead pipe, because not only can you smack people over the head with it (obviously) If there is a damaged wall you can use the pipes to climb it! I loved this aspect and thought it was pretty cool. Over all the rating I give Wolfenstein: The Old Blood on a 1 to 5 scale, a 4/5, because while it has sweet mechanics to it. It still needs work in areas like AI improvement, nerfing of certain enemies, bug fixing of that Panzerhund fight at the checkpoint to Castle Wolfenstein, and less stealth sequences. Thats my opinion of Wolfenstein: The Old Blood. I hope Machine Games and Bethesda continue to make expansions to there single player games as it tells a bit more of a story to the base game...",

Good: -More of the same. If you loved TNO, you'll still love this. -Delves deeper into the occult. Whereas TNO is about Deathshead, this about the SS Paranormal Division last seen in Return to Castle Wolfenstein. -Oh, if you love RtCW, have recently played it, or just remember it fondly, you will LOVE THIS. I won't spoil anything though. -There's a minor branch in the story that's integrated seamlessly into the gameplay, so that's kinda cool  Bad: -Not enough character development this time around.

It suffers from almost every single problem that was present in The New Order; Still no way to turn off Depth of Field or the absurd amounts of glaring from lightsources and most blurs types. Constantly you go through points of no return when you wanted to search area's for collectables or equiptment. No way to manual/quick save to not be locked into the PoNR checkpoints.   It practically opens with a Forced Stealth Section that's a hour long right out the door, being this is a prequel and you learned how to hack/pick locks in the future you don't do any of that, also your cutting laser is also future-tech and not appearing in this game, instead you get the new climbing mechanic is more dull then any mechanic it replaces because never is it anything more then rotating left and right click.   The silly Perk upgrade requirement's are back but there mostly meaningless now, unlike The New Order almost all of them are slight buffs to ammo pickup or health regen so there doesn't seem to be anything huge like the previous game that you need to work for. Also your basically garunteed to get all of them just from playing normally and shooting everyone, since their all rather simple things like kill 200 guys with a mounted gun, well there's a half dozen turrent sections in the first 3 hours alone.   Overall if you played throught The New Order, both sides, and still wanted to play more of the exact same game but with different minigames, then this is for you. If your like me and did a single side and got bored and quit part way through the alternative timeline then your going to get bored here really quickly.  *** Edit 8/10/15:  Another 2 hours later, (because I have nothing better to do.) Still sucks ♥♥♥♥. Still just walking though the same castle, with the same weapons, doing turret sections fighting the exact same 3 guards types for the last 4 straight hours.  There is still no exciting locations, Moonbase? London? Underwater jew... lab thing?... ♥♥♥♥ all that, you get none of that, you got boring ♥♥♥ stone nazi castle for the entire thing.  What about the cool robot dogs, the 10 story high tripods, sharks with laser beams attached to their heads? Nope, 3 types of guards, and a drone I seen twice in a cutscene that shot a plot device at me.  Overall after these 4 hours I feel this Pipe you find in a sewer prison is the real hero of the story, cuz BJ does every ♥♥♥♥ing thing with this pipe. He climbs with it, he plot device gets out of boss fights with it, opens doors and hatches with it, stealth kills with, it's honestly pretty ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. If Nazi's had these pipes, why the ♥♥♥♥ would they need to make anything else, the world would fall to these things.  Overall game remains ♥♥♥♥. God help me because I'm still atleast 3 hours from the end and I just want the credits to roll so I can delete this piece of ♥♥♥♥ and atleast say I beat it.  ***  Edit 8/11/15  Beat it, Of the 8 chapters this game has the only somewhat interesting ones are the last 2. Because their the only 2 not in the same boring ♥♥♥ castle. The end boss was also a joke. Thank god its done, deleted. 3/10.",

First off, this game is basically the new Doom game for the modern casual, with a different setting and modern, generic, fps mechanics. This may be good news to some, but for me and people like me, it would probably make you suicidal. Also, it suffers from the same bug the new Doom game suffers from, the ability to not unbind pre-binded key bindings. On top of this, I find it funny how it gives you several advanced graphical &amp; texture settings for textures that are no better than an old Call of Duty game. What the hell is the point of that? Huge guns are silent, melee kills are louder than said huge guns, but are still silent to enemy AI for some reason, character models are copied and pasted and I just couldn't play this game anymore because of all these reasons.  I expected this game to be bad and generic and it was, but I did not expect Bethesda to carry out the traditions of The Old Blood and games like The Old Blood, to the new Doom game, for the new Doom game has very similar menus and interface, some of the same bugs, etc.  If this game did anything for me, it was allowing me to remember how poopy Bethesda currently is as a company.

The Old Blood is a great introduction to the modern world of Wolfenstein. Fantastic weapons, maps, enemies combined with multiple ways to utilize the former 2 to create a mess for the latter makes it a very enjoyable experience. If I'm being honest though, The Old Blood is pretty standard in terms of its game design (but great fun nonetheless) and 6-7+ hours of campaign time as well as the challenge maps easily warrant the price point it was given. However when comparing it to The New Order, this prequel falls short. While The New Order had exceptional writing and character design, any attempt at noteworthy characters in this are very forgettable and not even worth batting an eye at and to me that's unfortunate having played The New Order first. If you've never played either, start with The Old Blood and then The New Order because in that line of things it really feels like this prequel was building up to something Grand which it most definitely does.   As far as performance is concerned, it ran pretty great on my machine. i5 4670k @4.0ghz 16gb RAM GTX970   1080p-144hz-60+fps Easily able to max out everything besides the AA settings which I ran at 4x.

You can turn the difficulty up and shoot through the whole game and it will be a very different experience than playing on medium and stealthing when you can. Compared to New Order, the areas that you fight in feel a little bigger and have more options for cover. The game spits a ton of weak enemies at you so the battles are a little more frenetic and fun than New Order's, which had more battles with big obnoxious robots later in the game. Graphics are incredible if you have the card for it, though some textures remind you that this was made for ps4/xbone as well.

I agree there were more stealth that suited my taste but nothing is stopping you from breaking stealth and just killing a bunch of Nazis. Plus, there are plenty of awesome 'loud' battles to keep you sated. Overall, this point-and-click FPS is quite enjoyable.  Kind of a side note is the game includes levels 2-9 of episode 1 of the original Wolfenstein 3D, if you can find them.

Sound quality is medocre, with often good tension music and good voice acting, but almost nothing else in terms of ambient effects and gun sounds.

It was not until Chapter did I find some fun, but half of the game is gone and it seems the story is too short and not satisfying. The combat is good but feels the same as New Order.

            "review_text": "Wolfenstein: The Old Blood is difficult for me to actually recommend due to its very (in my opinion) cash-in feel; unlike its predecessor, The New Order, the game felt like boring to play at times and it was criminally short and easy. Whereas The New Order succeeded in blending together narrative, pacing, and gameplay into a single, satisfying package, The Old Blood's storyline and characters are exceedingly weak in comparison. After completing the game on its hardest difficulty in exactly five hours, I felt like the game could have been so much more than the end result ended up delivering.  While the overall game itself does not shine, the gameplay is still incredibly solid and slightly improves upon the systems in The New Order by making stealth a more viable option and giving the protagonist a melee weapon, allowing for more frantic close-quarters combat. The guns themselves all feel weighty and powerful, both in sound design and actual damage. Just like The New Order, The Old Blood allows for the player to dual-wield weapons and sprint around rapidly rather than succumbing to typical FPS tropes that force the player to take potshots from cover until all of the enemies in the next room are dead--this helps the game remain enjoyable to play throughout its duration. Unfortunately, while the combat is a blast, the difficulty is an absolute joke. The New Order certainly was not a hard game on Uber (the max, save for a few challenge modes) difficulty, but there was a spot or two that defintely caused me trouble. This wasn't the case with The Old Blood for me; I was a bit confused during the final boss fight, but after initally dying to it, the game essentially flat-out tells you how to beat it with a loading screen tip. This was the sole part of the game I found difficult to any degree, and while I suppose that it's better for a game to be moderately easy than for it to have enemies with massive health pools and one-shot attacks, I was expecting far more of a challenge than I actually received. The gunplay in the two modern Wolfenstein games is absolutely great, but I hope that for any future iterations, MachineGames strives to build a more difficult experience that truly tests the skill of its players.  As previously mentioned, the story, pacing, characters, et al. take a backseat to the gameplay in The Old Blood, which is fairly disappointing as the writing in The New Order was much better than I expected it to be. The game starts with the main character, BJ Blazkowicz, attempting to infiltrate the Nazi stronghold of Castle Wolfenstien in the midst of an alternate-history World War II in which the Allies are losing. His objective is to attempt to discover the location of Deathshead, who is later the main antagonist in The New Order. Of course, given that an FPS game wouldn't be much of an FPS game without combat, the infiltration fails spectacularly and Blazkowicz must attempt to escape from the facility and continue on with his mission in a much more violent manner than intended.   Despite the game's short runtime, it ends up being divided into two distinctive parts, with a major antagonist driving the conflict in each. The first half deals with a (fairly contrived) antagonist named Rudi Jäger, a tall and muscular German commander with a fetish for dogs and robotics. The only purpose that he serves is to spring up as a boss battle so that the two parts of the game can be somewhat thematically divided; he doesn't honestly show up that much prior to the fight and his character is poorly-developed at best. After his death, the main antagonist transitions to Helga von Schabbs, a very unhappy archaeologist who believes that she has the means to bring the war to an even quicker end with a discovery that she unearths. While Helga is a slightly better villan than Rudi is, mainly due to the fact that you can find some of her backstory littered about in the various notes in the game, she still pales in comparison to any of the villans in The New Order, especially Frau Engel, whose personality was all over the place (in a good way). It can be inferred that the reason for the lack of character and narrative development is that The Old Blood is a 'budget' title, leaving the short storyline at fault. Even though Helga is the main antagonist of the second half of the game (and, technically speaking, the game as a whole), you still don't get to see her very much; rather, a good portion of the second part is spent killing    zombies.    All in all, it would have been nice to see more character development for all of the characters, considering that it was one of the defining features of The New Order.  Again, this isn't to imply that The Old Blood is a bad game; it's still one of the best singleplayer FPS games in recent memory, and it manages to stand out above the rest with its fast-paced and enjoyable combat. However, The New Order, was a far, far superior game in every single aspect except for gameplay. The price difference between the two reflects this, but regardless, wait for a sale and don't come into The Old Blood expecting a 'worthy' successor to The New Order. Given that The New Order ended on a cliffhanger, one can only hope that The Old Blood is serving to deliver a bit more Wolfenstein while MachineGames develops a true sequel.",

            "review_text": "3 / 5  Might as well be called 'Return to Wolfenstein', but still worth the price of admission (once you wait for it to go on sale).  B.J. is back in the expansion to The New Order...putting the Wolfenstein hero back in the WWII era killing Nazi's of every size and type. Storyline is utterly forgettable with characters that are interesting enough, but don't approach the level of those found in The New Order. Still, they are adequate and used to foreshadow / provide some interesting insights into where some of the things from The New Order came from. Of note, there's an element of humor in B.J.'s musings this time around and I think there was a concerted effort to show the character of B.J. showing the strain of his previous adventures and the slow descent into the quasi craziness exhibited in The New Order. In general, it works and was a welcoming 'lightening' of the game that provides a direct prelude to the events of The New Order.  The majority of the game follows the same action/stealth combination so successful in the main game, but tends to do a better job of implementing them into realistic gameplay. Too often, The New Order forced you out of stealth into a needless gunbattle. The Old Blood lets stealth portions be stealth, combat sections be combat, and generally leaves open areas enough methods to deal with enemies as the player sees fit. There's a few places where things seem forced on the player, but they are few and far between. Weapons / enemies are almost exactly the same and those that are different are slight variations on what already exists. As such, you'll spend most of the time with the same 'favorite' you always used.   The main gripe in this game comes in the last chapters, encompassing roughly 2 hours of gameplay. Basically once zombies show up the game gets very repetitive and downright boring. Zombies do a lot of damage in melee (at least on Uber) but are slow, shambling creatures that somehow manage to get an insane burst of speed when they get close. This would normally create some tense situations in most games, but level design bounces between 'too large and thus far too easy to kill zombies before they become a threat' and 'so claustrophobic it feels cheap when I get hit by a zombie from behind'. In addition, zombies seem to always know where you are making stealth in their areas at least extremely difficult if not outright impossible. As if that wasn't enough, some zombies still carry their guns and will fire at you with surprising accuracy. For some reason that just simply doesn't feel right...The final negative is the final boss battle. Using a strange combination of stealth centric combat you alternate between shooting an ancient monster in the mouth, moving silently around the space, and getting the boss to kill waves of Nazi's for you (since the monster cannot see, only attacks by sound). To point, even on Uber it is extremely repetitive, easy, and downright not fun.  In any case, the majority of this game was fun and provides much of the same gameplay of what The New Order provides, albeit with less of the style the previous game had, but has too dissappointing an ending. Still, worth the price of a Steam sale and a definate recommend to any FPS fan.",

Although this game is very short, it is stunning and I never once get bored or sigh 'ugh, I have to do this AGAIN?' like I did in The New Order, which towards the end has a problem of getting very repetitive.",

            "review_text": "Excellent First person shooter. Excellent graphics and graphic details.   But there was something missing from the story both going through the village and dealing with the SS Paranormal division.   There were fewer overheard conversations (stories) in the village, too many locked building doors, and SS Paranormal was simply zombies dropping from the sky and a big monster at the end.   SS Paranormal in 'Return to Castle Wolf' were beautiful women with machine guns (in a church, in a mansion, and finally in the graveyard). The variety of settings and difference in gameplay were good aspects. Also, you would overhear more conversations with the 'Return to Castle Wolf' SS Paranormal than you do with this game (Wolf the old blood).   I enjoyed dealing with the talking monster king at the end of 'Return to Castle Wolf' more than the monster at the end of this game. He had more personality; wanted to take over the world; and turned Helga into his zombie slave in 'Return to Castle Wolf' ... that was much better than the non-speaking monster at the end of this game who's most endearing aspect was his ability to deal blunt force trauma.   'Return to Castle Wolf' also allowed you to sneak around the village more. This game (Wolf the old blood) on the other hand was a constant fire fight. Suppose I could try harder at stealth but .... this doesn't seem like a stealth game. You run into one tough opponent and the stealth game is over.   This game is also more dark and serious than 'Return to Castle wolf.' Not as much humor, and our hero, William J. Blazkowicz, does not vacation on the front lines of the war killing Nazi for fun. He is kind of sad and angry. A man of stone with a dream of hearth and home that never comes true. I don't mind but ... this is a game.   Still, very enjoyable. Nice graphical details. ^__^",

I was a mega-fan of Return to Castle Wolfenstein &amp; this seems to have that element... This is a preliminary take on this game as I'm still working through it. However I've played enough to appreciate, admire &amp; point out that as a shooter, fundamentally this game is SPOT ON, therefore enjoyable to play. The graphics &amp; kill animations complete the package. It's already woth the $10.00 I paid for it :)  Ok just started Chapter 3: 'Wolfenstein Keep'. This game ♥♥♥♥ing RULES! Somehow they've recaptured that feeling from 'Return to Castle Wolfenstein' This game is a Home Run, perfect 10 - the way FPS games were meant to be played. The gunplay and gunfight animations are beautifully done. There's ample time to explore between gun battles, some of which can be fierce... The weapons feel GOOD &amp; have good power - an assault rifle that is actually useful as a good all-around weapon, what a concept... By the way the assault rifle feels like a 7.62x51 G3/HK91 in power and handling...  The graphics are absolutely beautiful! (I'm running an i7-3770 stock, paired with a GTX 980ti stock on Windows 7 Pro 16GRAM 1600MHz. Full specs on profile page.) The game runs as smooth as silk, no bugs or glitches yet. Love how it's broken up into Chapters...  Completed game. This game is INSANE! However 4 Stars, taking one away due to length, the game is pretty short...  Cheers ~Vortex  Rock, I see this in your wish list, don't hesitate it's phenomenal... I got it for 10 bucks, Well worth your $10.00",

Nothing particularly new from the New Order, but that's fine by me. A great game all around.

Considerably shorter, this prequel has more of the same elements which made The New Order, in my opinion, a good game: The enviroments are beautiful, the gunplay is spot on and the story doesn't get much in the way of shooting nazis. It also puts a little more context behind the universe in The New Order.  Talking a bit about shooting nazis, like in The New Order, this game is about 40% shooting and killing nazis, nazi dogs, nazis in power armor, super nazi robot dogs and some zombie equivalents.  All things considered, I'd recommend getting this only for a price you'd find affordable. I got about 5 hours of entertainment out of the main story and since I'm not really into challenge modes, that'll be about all I get.",
