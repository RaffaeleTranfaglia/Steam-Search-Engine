            "review_text": "I'm very torn about recommending this game or not. I would not put it in that class of good hidden object games like those made by artifex mundi but it's not so bad that I would say not to get it. However the ending made me say don't get it.   Pros: Decent character models Decent voice acting Puzzles are okay Story is kind of predictable but it's not horrid  Cons: Poor quality graphics  Often times hidden objects will be stupidly hidden, not cleverly  You need to use items from your inventory for some hidden objects to appear and there is no indication if that last item that is blued out (meaning not visable) is hidden behind something or needs an inventory item  Navigating can be messy and you rely on clicking the map instead of moving  It has clear this game needs polish, text in game looks like default MS Word font instead of looking like old age writing  Puzzles can be annoying and tedious like matching symbols with far too many to match and the instructions need to be clicked instead of being told to you, the latter part being a minor annoyance  You are also given jump scares occasionally and there is this girl in a wedding dress that appears often. But unless I'm missing something, I assume she's   your dead sister   but why is she in a wedding dress? I usually pay attention to plot so either the plot was so uninteresting I glaced over her explination or she wasn't given one. Either way its a con.   Major Con: (SPOILERS)    This is what made me give this a no for recommending it. The ending scene that you work so hard to get to looks poorly made. There is black text with no background just floating and it's hard to read while your character and the guy in the story who only met once and agreed to go out to coffee together... which they didn't do mind you, say they love each other... Like really? I don't believe this was built up at all and just forced to give the character a love interest. It's just... such bad writing there.    Overall it looks and feels like this game maker has potential but right now the lack of polish is very visable. With some work this game could have been better. If you can get this for cheap go for it but for full price there are far many more better games of this type.",

            "review_text": "This was not a very great game.  It has achievements and trading cards, so that was at least something, and you won't even have to suffer through the game twice to get all of the achievements. It also had some fairly enjoyable puzzles and mechanics, and there is voice acting that is not bad.  Other than that, I did not much enjoy this game. The hidden object scenes aren't amazing looking, and there is a fair amount of errors in them (such as repeated objects and mislabeled objects). There is way too much back and forth to go back to random places where new objects or HOS have magically appeared, and finding those places is next to impossible without using hints or your map.  Most of the puzzles are very easy, while some are just confusing and rely too much on aforementioned back and forth, while the game doesn't even inform you of what you need to find a lot of the time. More than once, you have to actually backtrack from a hidden object scene to randomly go find something else, and then come back to it later. The puzzles just don't seem to follow a logical order. Towards the end, the puzzles seemed more streamlined and enjoyable, with a bit less back and forth and less random places to go back and look for random things in.  The plot is flimsy at best, some of the music is nice but the ~super spooky pieces were a bit grating, and while some of the jump scares get you (warning to those who don't like jump scares) the 'scary' bits are so cliche, random, and inconsistent that I could not get into the atmosphere of the game at all. Also, I know this is a small detail, but the text/font bothered me a LOT in this game.",

            "review_text": "I'll come right out and say it: Plot is never the strong point of a hidden object game. For some reason they're always disjointed messes of scenes, with little connective tissue between them. Alchemy Mysteries: Prague Legends suffers heavily from this syndrome, leading you around by the nose and telling you all about things that might be interesting if you had any agency in them. Honestly it wouldn't be a very good use of your time if not for the surprising level of polish found within.  As the title implies, you putter around Prague in a very low-key effort to solve an alchemy-related mystery. Don't get too excited about either of these points, however, because Prague is little more than a streetcorner between a house, cafe, and spooky graveyard. The entire game plays out in a very limited area, with you scouring studies and bookshelves over and over in search of new doodads to unlock things. At least the time of day changes as you progress, giving areas new context and walling some off for a time.  You'll find inventory items as you wander, most of which have obvious applications even if they themselves are ecclectic. Prague Legends at least has a good flow to its puzzles, and between the logical progression and the excellent map system you'll never find yourself stuck. The hidden object scenes are the only place that might hang you up at all because they tend to be challenging and include items that must be combined, sometimes with inventory items. There are also a dozen or so actual puzzles to solve with clear instructions that provide some welcome variety to the wandering and hidden object scenes.  The plot is banal garbage about a golem and scary people who want to use it, but there's very little interaction between your character and the happenings in the game at all. This can lead to boredom if the item hunts aren't keeping your attention. Strangely all the effort seems to have gone into the graphics, which are some of the best the genre has to offer. Scenes rotate with a smooth, convincing 3D effect, and the few NPCs you encounter are presented in shockingly detailed 3D.  There are some ham-fisted spooks that'll have you laughing if anything, and if not that then the voice acting will crack you up as you listen to a bunch of Prague natives speak in uneffected American accents. Still, the graphical achievements are worth noting and the gameplay itself is quite solid. As long as you don't mind much mystery in your mysteries, this is a perfectly serviceable title.",

Alchemy Mysteries seems to be more difficult than a typical HOG, not always it's obvious where to go next. Some puzzles are generated randomly, so you won’t be able to look up the answer, also the rules of a few mini games could be more precise. Nevertheless, the gameplay is entertaining and some of the game’s mechanics are fairly unique.  The story in general is quite interesting, although the ending felt too sudden. Visually the game is very pleasant to the eye, music is adequate, but not memorable. Achievements are easy to obtain.  In short, for a low price you’re getting a decent and enjoyable game. 7/10.",

Some of the puzzles are easy and some are hard, some took me a while to complete but they are doable. The Story is ok, and so is the dialogue and voicing, it's not great but it's not bad. I did however like the atmosphere of the game. Took me 5 hours to complete fully while following a guide and on the advanced difficulty, while taking breaks.  If you do get stuck on most things you can use hints making things a bit easier, not the minigames though.  It is a easy game to 100% first playthrough if you follow a guide, and the game itself is quite cheap compared to other titles.",

Objects hide beneath each other. At times there didn't seem a clear objective. The ending is extremely dull and anticlimactic. Took 4 painful hours to beat.",

            "review_text": "Maybe I don't play hidden object games that much, but Alchemy Mysteries consistently disappointed me at every turn. Invariable backtracking, outrageously tedious puzzle games, and a storyline that's plagued with plotholes. The only thing this game has going for it are the animations for characters and ghosts, most of which are ruined by the absolutely awful voice acting.   Backtracking is really the focal issue in this game. It's almost as if they couldn't design enough levels to fit all their useless hidden object minigames. Get the items from the briefcase, use them in another room, go back to the briefcase, get an item, use them in another room. It drones on and on until they breach your monotony with another boring cutscene of someone NPC talking with peanut butter in their mouth.  Also, I couldn't help but ask my self, 'Why the heck do I need all these items?' Maybe I'm just not into hidden object games as much as the next person, but why would I need to get a duster to wipe away some cobwebs, when the main character consistently picks up handfuls of spiders in hidden object minigames? Why do I need a god damn rapier to open up a wall cover when I had a hammer/crowbar in my inventory?   I digress.   I could put all of that aside. The horrible voice-acting, the trainwreck minigames, and the awful storyline. I could give Alchemy Mysteries the benefit of the doubt on everything above, but the one thing I will not are the puzzles. I literally spent an hour on a single puzzle because of how comically difficult it was. Allow me to give you an example of the puzzle because these things pop up like weeds in games like this.  You backtrack through the game and find two clock hands. Great, you can finally put them on the clock and fix it so you can progress the story. Once you put them on, you're looking at a clockface with three different-styled hands. You have to match all three hands with their respective shadows, but you only have three buttons and each button moves two hands at the same time. That's not fun; that's actually really god damn boring.   Maybe I'm not masochistic enough, but I was struggling really hard to continue this game after an hour of that puzzle. I just kept pressing buttons until I finished the game because there's no strategy, structure, or style to a minigame like that. It's all random and good luck figuring that out quickly. These puzzles, though.. They're littered throughout the game and I kept dreading the time I'd have to do one again.   I cannot recommend this game at this time.   Boring story, horrible voice-acting, bad puzzles, and backtracking that doesn't make any sense. The jumpscares and animations are the only thing going for this game and, even then, it's ruined by the lack of depth and (clearly) money that the developers didn't have to hire someone competent enough to read their lines off realistically. Alchemy Mysteries is not even worth the price on a discount.",
