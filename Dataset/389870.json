            "review_text": "I really want to enjoy this game, I really do. I'm going to finish it at least, even if it kills me, which it might. After a long kick of Hyperdimension Neptunia Rebirth 1 and 2, I decided to pick this game up, too since it was made by the same developers, thinking it would be a lot like the other 2 games (as well as Fairy Fencer F.) Sadly, compared to those 3 other games, this one feels very lacking. Not in content mind you, but in direction and I guess you would say 'composure.' This game has so many 'gimmicks' that just get in the way of gameplay it's rediculous and they just pile it all on top of you in the first hour of gameplay.   There's peon capturing, where you use your 7 'moe forms' to match the enemies moe preference, then you have to choose from a group of random words to form some kind of sentence. Oh, did I mention which words you choose also need to match up with what mood (there are 7 seperate moods) the enemy is in, or else the enemy flips its ♥♥♥♥ and goes berserk, regaining all HP and getting an increase in attack and defense.   Then they throw these crystals into the mix that emit auras that do certain things (Some boost EXP, some decrease HP, some lock you in place so you cant move.) You can also go all Moe on the crystals to destroy them and cause another power up.  Finally, there's knocking the enemies around, where skills that you use can be toggled to knock an enemy back into other enemies, friendlies, or crystals to damage them like some kind of demented game of pool. After smashing a crystal, it goes into frenzy mode where you need to use certain skills to knock enemies into the air to break floating crystals.   You can make your own characters and customize their appearance, class, clothing, etc, but they're woefully underpowered and there's really no point in using them so far. They dont start with skills and they hardly learn any skills. Why use them when you can just dominate everything with your storymode characters?  Then there's the graphics, which pale in comparison to Rebirth 1, 2 and Fairy Fencer F. There's a weird fog that kind of hangs in the distance and the game needs some kind of Antialiasing because the staircasing on the sprites is brutal.  For me, this game is one big headache and I'm only able to play it a little at a time, but I am gonna finish it just to say that I have mastered the game of 100 gimmicks.  (I'm actually kinda glad they removed the hotsprings washing minigame, just cause it would be another gimmick on top of a huge gimmicky pile of gimmicks. Gimmick!)  Edit: See, there's so many minigames in this that I already forgot about one. The ship battles, which are kind of neat but essentially come down to a kind of rock paper scissors game where the amount of Peons you have somehow govern your powers and attacks for your ship. All these features are explained once, and so far, I havent found a help menu to explain them again. They pop up right before it needs explaining, then it just assumes you understand all of it and send you on your way without much of a demonstration. Then there's the Peon ball, which is sort of a ticking time bomb that can get bigger the more of something (I really have no idea) you do, and it can also reach critical mass and wipe your entire party for also doing other things (still, I have NO idea why it gets big, or why it blows me up.)",

            "review_text": "I was hoping that the port to PC would make this game better but it turns out that if you polish a turd, it's still a turd.  Mugen Souls tries very, very hard to be deep and interesting but it ends up as a pile of game systems and mechanics that don't mesh together at all. G-Castle Battles are like playing rock-paper-scissors except if you lose enough times you get a Game Over. The Moe Kill system and Chou-Chou's Form Change could have been interesting but there are so many affinities that at any given time you're about 100% likely to be in the wrong form to actually perform a Moe Kill. The Blast-Off system seems to work once for the tutorial and then the rest of the time, you do so little damage to anything with knockback that there's no point, so I have no clue why they even introduce it at the beginning of the game. Creating your own custom units makes sense for a strategy RPG where you're allowed to have many units out at once but you can only have 4 characters in your party and your party has already filled with clearly superior story characters by the time you get out of the first couple of chapters or so, so that's another pointless system. And Mugen Field is a pathetic attempt to ape Disgaea's Item World that somehow manages to miss everything about Item World that makes it fun.  In short, Mugen Souls is (still) irredeemably bad, regardless of how it was censored for Western release. It's just another bad JRPG trying to ride on moe.",

It blew away my expectations. It takes the best parts of Disgaea (the elaborate customisation options) and Agrest (some battle mechanics) and smooshes them together to make this awesome hybrid of both games. I highly recommend this game and for the price it is, I reckon it's a steal!",

            "review_text": "I already played it to completion on PS3, and it's the same thing here.  The whole concept is 'over the top', with stats and levels going way beyond what you would need for the story, equipment that can turn a level 1 into killing machines (maxing out a basic piece of equipment already gives more power than you would need for the story).  The 'charm' is very opaque at first, because they didn't implement the UI of the second game, and the same goes for the tutorial issues.  The main 'cons' would be the tutorials, because you can only view them once per game, no menu to view them again or anything.   Also, for those prefering english voices, it needs to be noted that the 'generic' characters you can create (mostly useless during the story, only actually useful when power levelling past the level 1000) only have voices in japanese.",

            "review_text": "If you have played the hyperdimension Neptunia games then this game will be right up your alley.  The battle system is really nice looking and seems to work really well too.  The game is pretty funny with some of its dialogue, at least I found some of it funny.   The only few drawbacks, party members you create don't have a voice in English for some reason, although in japanese they work fine.  Another drawback is that the 'Moe Kill' system does take a bit of getting used to but once you have figured out what works when, it is definitely worth it to use it at every opening.  One final drawback, if you don't like being God-like from the getup, you may wish to disable most of the DLC. The DLC which add cosmetic stuff is fine but a lot of the other DLC gives you VERY op weapons and armour. Even if you sell it you will have far too much gold for that point and lose track of what kind of strength your supposed to be.   All in all it is a very fun game and I would recommend it to anyone who's a bit bored of your typical turn based RPG game.",

            "review_text": "Before I start I also, own this for PS3 and have raced many more hours there. In my opinion this is a fairly good game. It's has a unique style to it not seen elsewhere. What Mugen souls is, is a turn based tactical RPG. While other Tactical RPGs may have areas designated for special field effects, this game uses circles and crystal-like objects to designate them. These can be broken for a variety of more effects and bonuses. The game allows you hit enemies around like hockey pucks on an ice rink. The initial concepts can seem overwhelming at first but aren't extremely difficult to learn. The hardest thing to learn in this game for me was the Moe Kill system. This is a system where you can use the main characters personaility type along with some phrases to turn enemies into loyal subjects or 'Peons' as the game puts it. What makes this difficult is there is no guide or help in game to tell you what phrases match with the 7 personailities or what ones are effective against the other. The game could of had a library where as you use phrases and test out the moe system it unlocks and lets you know what is and isn't effective. I personally am a big fan of NISA and own many of there games, one of the biggest draws for me personally is with this game you can create your own custom characters. While Disgaea has some nice color palette swaps, in this game you can go in and actually alter and dress up your characters. I recommend this game for anyone who is a fan of long grindy RPG games.  In regards to the censorship. I did some research and appearantly this game is in fact censored. They removed a bathining mini game where you wash the female characters in game. For me personally I could care less about it. Quite a few characters look underage and I don't really want to see them nude anyways. The title recieved what would be considered an M rating in Japan and a T rating here. The censorship does not just end with this mini game though, the translations of certian characters have been toned down as the team felt they were too vulgar for this type of game. Personally I found most of the characters dull and lacking of common sense. That compiled with the underage look of several of the female cast makes the story rather lack-luster and obviously pandering to a niche. The censorship in no way really effects the game or takes away from it.  My final thoughts are if you look past the story and characters what you have left is a decent tactical RPG, with some overly complicated portions. If your a fan of grindy RPGs and can look past the story and characters this is a worth-while title that will have you busy for a long time to come.",

            "review_text": "Game is confusing as ♥♥♥♥ and does an even poorer job of explaining its own mechanics to any coherent degree. Apparently it is notorious for this problem. Also literally loaded with level 9001 anime weeaboo cancer that may lead directly to severe stroke and dyslexia, as well as Parkinson's Disease.   The art stlyle looks like Disgaea on the surface, but all further resemblences stop there, to the point that at best it's like if a generic Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;birth clone drugged Disgaea on a blind date and then ♥♥♥♥ed her half to death in a back alley of Amsterdam's Red Light District, then 9 months later Disgaea left behind a dumpster baby, and this game is that dumpster baby.   But admittedly I've seen and played worse RPGs in terms of gameplay, and if this game was slightly less of a cluster♥♥♥♥ in terms of its interface and how confusing in every way its playability is I wouldn't even bother writing a review telling you that it's not worth $20, and that you should wait for an 80-90% off sale if you're still that curious. I got it at 40% off during the initial promotional sale, so I'll probably make a point of finishing it some time just because I do that with most RPGs, but take care not to just grab this game on impulse. That's unhealthy anyways.  Caveat emptor, if you're neither familiar with these sorts of JRPGs or are not patient and/or bored out of your mind, don't bother with this. Very much a niche market thing. Also, you can (quite literally) make the blue-haired guy in your party into a trap. Not even joking around.",
