    "description": "(NOT A MOBILE GAME PORT or NOT AN RPG MAKER GAME!!!) You are a creature just like others. You have the same needs, the same abilities. There is just one difference; you can talk with the Spirit of The Nature. Gather items, craft weapons, achieve your dreams, start a family, form a party and complete the quests without dying.",
