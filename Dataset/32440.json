A difference between the Complete Saga and the original LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game, are two previously deleted levels, The Bounty Hunter's Pursuit, and Anakin's Flight. These are unlockable by obtaining Gold Bricks.  As with many of the other LEGO games, Single Player Mode as well as Co-operative Two-Player mode is available locally. Having played this particular game on both the PS3, as well as PC, I can say I haven't seen any difference. If you enjoy the LEGO series, this is a must have for the collection. If you are new to LEGO games, LEGO Star Wars - The Complete Saga is a great place to start.  ",

            "review_text": "This is a fun game but somewhat antiquated feeling if you've played the newer Lego games and then go back and play this. For those who may not know, this is a combination of 2 original titles - Lego Star Wars and Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy. I have played neither of those but from my understanding, their recreation in this 'Complete Saga' is pretty faithful to the original games with some minor changes here and there. One of the nice bonus features is that they let you play the original version of 2 stages from the first game and you can tell that they definitely made some improvements in terms of the maneuvering and physics on those stages. However on one of the stages they also made it a lot easier by essentially removing certain goals that have to be met throughout the stage to continue.  On the whole thoguh, if you've played most any Lego game before, then you know what to expect. If not, then expect to smash a lot of stuff, play as a lot of different characters from the Star Wars series and use those characters' various abilities to progress through stages and find the insane amount of collectibles, if you so choose. As with most Lego games, this game goes almost overboard on the sheer amount content and collectibles that you have to play and find to achieve 100% if you're a completionist like me. This one really almost wore me down and I feel that they maybe put a bit TOO much, but you certainly get your money's worth.  All in all, if you're a Lego game fan and/or a Star Wars fan, I would recommend this game. It does a very good job of staying mostly faithful to the Star Wars movies, while taking some creative liberties in order to keep gameplay consistent. It also has the light-hearted humor throughout that the Lego games are known for and I think that Star Wars fans will appreciate most of it. Again though, be prepared for a slight feeling of antiquated controls and mechanics if you've played newer Lego games, sepcifically Lego Star Wars III: The Clone Wars because they have definitely continously made gameplay improvements over the years.",

Makes it feel like you're playing with legos. -Uses the hub system, so no open world like the newer lego games. -Hardly any bugs. Runs well. -Overuses the 'Scrolling Space Credit Opener' &amp; Star Wars theme song for every single level.. For 24 levels, or 48 since you beat each level twice, plus bonus levels, So you'll get tired of both of em fast but you can skip so plus. -Fun game, simple, and long-ish. -Nice graphics, easy on the eyes.",

I've never reccomended another game as much as I can reccomend this one. I've logged over 200 hours on the DS version with less levels and features. This game includes many levels with puzzels that require different types of characters in order to get collectables and other objects in order to complete the game and to unlock secret areas and levels. Unlike other LEGO games, such as LEGO Indiana Jones, the puzzles are not tedious and not required for progression. Even with the game's cheat codes, the game is still as fun as ever and with no DLC, it is truly worth a buy.",

I am sure this is a result of wanting players to use the co-op feature. An that is my second issue. This really really is best served as a co-op play. You will enjoy it far more if you play with a friend, the wife, the hubby, the kids...anyone but the A.I. Now to recap the great here. All Star Wars films, the original 4,5,6 and the prequel 1,2, and 3. All here, all very in depth, insideously cute, and amazingly deep. The collectable got to get every Lego alone is a 100 to 150 hours alone. The reply value here is endless.....

Coming from having played some of the more recent LEGO games (LoTR, Marvel Superheroes), I can definitely see that the games have improved over the years.  Compared to the newer games, the easiest way to describe this game is annoying. There's a lot of endlessly respawning enemies in almost every level and not much you can do about them until you get to freeplay.  The hub world is cramped with no way to open the character roster to try out the characters you've unlocked without actually freeplaying a mission. Sometimes you can find the character you want wandering around the cantina if you get lucky. In freeplay, you have a tiny subset of your unlocked characters you can bring, of which all but 2 are chosen randomly so you probably won't get to play with your favorite characters.  Your AI controlled teammate does ZERO damage to enemies and is at best a distraction since the enemies focus almost exclusively on the player anyways. You're effectively punished for playing solo.  The difficulty (until you unlock cheats) is firmly on the side of annoying. The penalty for dying is minimal so it's not really difficult, but it's still not fun to be getting shot at by a dozen different enemies focused exclusively on you, interrupting you left and right and killing you frequently until you do whatever is needed to stop the respawns or move to the next area. On the other hand, the auto deflect cheat with exploding blaster bolts is immensely satisfying once unlocked.  Vehicle missions are awful. Controls are terrible, and there's way too much running back and forth through endlessly respawning swarms of enemies to pick up torpedoes or (even worse) tow a bomb to a target.  There's a lot more content reuse (game time is padded with an extra challenge mode for each level where you can't use extras) but it still counts towards 100% completion.  There's a very annoying bug where the game effectively freezes for a few seconds every once in awhile. This is on a modern PC with dedicated graphics and a SSD.  Much of this is forgiveable (except for the bugs) since this is simply a remastered version of the games that started this (mostly) wonderful collection of TellTale LEGO games. The newer games have improved upon these issues, and the newer games with the huge overworlds are surprisingly fun open world games.  I can recommend this game based on the humor and for anyone who wants to complete their LEGO game collection, but unless you've got some seriously strong rose colored glasses on the gameplay falls short compared to the newer games.",

Had high hopes we could play drop-in-style as a family or with friends using either our laptops or desktops wherever we were comfortable at home or away:(   So, I'm rating this a thumbs down on that one hangup as otherwise I'd have saved the cost of buying multiple copies and just stayed with the console version.",

Lego Starwars 2 has better humour, not just in cutscenes but the general enviroment is jam packed with outrageousness. The stages also feel more refined then Lego Starwars 1, there definitely aren't as many bs deaths either.    Battle Mechanics and Gameplay  Sadly this is the weakest aspect of the game, it has the simplicity of an early one button beat em up. Some characters are capable of doing more then just mashing the attack button, such as a rolling and then rapid fire or a force blast with a swipe. But for the most part the battling is weak, fights are usually short lived due to enemy HP being so fragile. If you're playing solo great ready to watch your AI partner never kill or assist you in a boss fight. They'll pretend they doing something (such as blocking or purposely shooting to the side of the enemy) but they're programmed to never kill... for whatever reason.  Sound  You can hate this entire game all you want but the soundtrack is spectactular. It's straight out of the movies.   Choice  Character variety is huge and I'm not talking about just character models. I would say there are different groupings of characters and each group has something that sets it apart from each other (Droids, Sithlords, Bounty Hunters, Troopers, Jedi, Indiana Jones. Rebels, YOUR CUSTOM CHARACTER(S), Lulzy characters, Misceclanous characters). Even in these groups almost every character is unqiue in some manner.    Stage Design  For those who have seen the series you will have no trouble recnogizing every piece of secenery, with a hint of Lego humour invovled. Bonus items are well placed and at times incredibly cryptic. The puzzles are basic at times and actually challenging at others (suprising if you've played other TT Lego games...).   Replabitlity  You will find yourself going back to a stage 2 or 3 times (especially for the Hoth Battle, Deathstar Run and Speeder Bike stages). Or you could play straight forward through the story and replay the free modes to 100%.",

This doesn't mean I think it's one of the best games I ever played as a kid but it's one I have very fond memories of and pretty much anyone I talk to about it has played it at some point. It's that perfect blend of co-op, collectathon, movie tie-in that's just great to play when I'm not feeling something very intense and just want to relax.   The game is most certainly flawed, the artificial difficulty and lack of any complex combat is the one of the big complaints; I never felt challenged playing this game but I also died a lot because the game throws enemies at you non stop and while they only take one hit to kill avoiding all the blaster bolts can prove annoying if you aren't a character with auto dodge. This really slows down the game and while I don't expect the most from the combat every lightsaber battle was jump attack, jump attack, jump attack ect. It's impossible to hit someone while they're blocking with anything other than the air attacks which are undodgeable by the AI if you're in range. I know this is a kids game and not meant to be challenging but after a while even kids would find this tedious at best.  The lack of online co-op is my biggest grind with this game. At first I thought it was an issue with it being such an old game that relies on single screen co-op but after checking other Lego games I realized that it was nothing more than a trend of laziness. I did manage to take my laptop to a friend's and play it with them and it was great fun except that save files are harder than needs be to locate and impossible to get working on a separate machine to the one it came from meaning we had to start a fresh with none of the cool characters I'd unlocked. Besides some of the vehicle levels being a bit lackluster and Superstory being total BS and a lazy way to recycle content these are my only real complaints with the game so from here on out it's all positive.   The Lego formula has practically been perfected now but that doesn't mean it wasn't always great. Star Wars has so much charm in its cutscenes and is very humoresque due to it's recognizable and lovable characters acting out the Star Wars story in a silly and joking way. There is so much to do in this game and so much to find. While some levels practically hand you the collectibles some can prove a real challenge to find, but if your smart you can aim to collect the stud multipliers and minikit/red brick detector red bricks giving you a hint on in which direction there is a collectible. There's also some extra game modes in the complete saga that add that make 100%ing this game a real journey as you try collect all the gold bricks.  One of the best things about Lego Star Wars is that it's well, Star Wars. Playing all your favourite Jedi battle it out on all those great planets from the Star Wars universe is immensely entertaining and even more fun in Lego. I would enjoy this game even if it wasn't Star Wars but the real heart and charm of the game comes from seeing your favorite scenes re-acted in Lego form.   There were dull moments while playing this game but I thoroughly enjoyed it and I felt both a sense of fulfillment and emptiness once I reached 100% which shows just how great this game is. May the force be with you all.",

Even though you know story, the LEGO characters give it a special touch.  Furthermore, for the completionists out there this game has many hidden treasures and extra levels to complete which makes this a really cool game to me.",

Im gonna try to review this game without notsagia in mind... this game is a realease of the first two games combined into one game called the ( Complete Saga )  it's a ok enjoyable experience, if you have never played this game and your over the age of 13-15 this game will most likely not be that fun. I do recommend this game for kids that are just getting into video games and also like movie's like Starwars. This game is more for a casual audience with easy to understand controls and simple levels. It has many diffrent colectibles like character's, powerup's and stud's or coins. This game also supports two players and with the price tag of $20 its a great game for starwars lovers and first time gamer's. 7/10",
