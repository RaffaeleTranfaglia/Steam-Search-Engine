            "review_text": "Unhack Destruction is an interesting mix of VN + Puzzle/Strategy/Action game. Regardless of the devs inexperience when putting this title together, as they state it was their first one on steam, the game flows pretty well and isn't too long or drawn out.  Some games you feel they could have just stopped and you would have been happy, or they continue to make insane challenge after insane challenge. That's not the case with Unhack. It feels just about the right length for the type of game that it is.  You are an unhacker (think Whitehat I suppose?) and your job is to fight the 5K worm and clean it out of systems. As you progress and revel the story that makes up our world, you learn about greed, sure as the description says, but really there is more there in terms of friendship, loyalty and sacrifice.   The game is very short, to be sure, and because of that, I'm not sure the price is right, but I picked it up in a bundle.   For the Otaku: No nudies for you, in fact the 'girls' will recognize you for who you are.  The artwork is pretty good, and the mix of tech with Anime doesn't clash as one might think originally.   Interesting concept and I'd love to see where the dev will go with this in Unhack 2.  Overall, Unhack is entertaining if short. Worth the hour long play through on Normal, and if you want a challenge, try it on it's other settings.  7/10",

            "review_text": "A nice little game that crosses the puzzle and visual novel genres. Solid art, voice acting, interface and gameplay. The only detail to critique is the lack of a resolutions option of some kind, the game is locked at 4:3. The game can be finished in around 1 or 2 hours but the story is well told and communicates the message without problem. There is some replayability but is more of a one time experience. A solid recommendation.",

            "review_text": "Unhack is by no means a groundbreaking gaming experience. There are a few technical issues that may hamper your experience. The game will last under two hours, all told. All those gripes aired though, I can say I did find the game moderately enjoyable.  The gameplay of Unhack somewhat reminds me of Chip's Challenge, though much simpler, with more of a focus on action than puzzle-solving. There's nothing particularly interesting or challenging about it and it serves mostly as way to pass the time while serving up dialog, though difficulty modes with limited lives exist which change this into a very different experience, where you must play carefully and skillfully or fail the mission. That may or may not be your thing. I was mostly in it for the dialog and so stuck with the normal difficulty.  The visual novel portion of the self-described 'visual novel x puzzle game' is similar to the gameplay portions in that nothing massively original or special ever happens, but nonetheless it's not a bad way to spend a few hours. The jokes are a bit cliche but manage to entertain nonetheless. The plot's pretty generic, but that doesn't matter either. It does a good job doing what it does and doesn't overstay its welcome (in fact it could have stood be just a  tad  longer). The art's not entirely to my taste, but it's good enough. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the voice acting, and most of the lines in the game have voices (your own character does not).  Now, about those technical issues. The game is built on a web engine that really isn't designed for gaming. It's forced into full-screen mode with no resolution options and no ability to play in windowed mode. There's no Steam overlay support, and consequently no Steam screenshots (barring some nasty workarounds). There are no Steam achievements either. The game doesn't save any information, so it won't show you where you are in the story, and it won't remember any settings you change. The lack of saving may be the reason there's no gallery of the CG's that appear at the end of each chapter, which is a pity because it'd be nice to be able to go back and see those all in one place.  Unhack is not a game without it's flaws, but again, I enjoyed it nonetheless. 'Good enough' would be a fair descriptor of it. There's a demo which you should absolutely try if you're interested in the game. It'll let you see how well your computer deals with some of the technical issues and get a feel for game's content yourself. You should be able to figure out if the game's right for you by the end of the second level.",

It's nothing special, really. The most memorable aspect is the story, even if it is quite cheesy.  The game is also very short. It'll take you about an hour to finish it, maybe even less. Really, after finishing the game I have only received 1 out of 5 trading cards, because it didn't take long enough for the rest. (You can leave it running after that of course.)  Would I recommend the game? Yes, if it's on sale and you don't mind very short games with little replay value.",

            "review_text": "Remember there is a free demo that covers 40% of the game. If you are interested, just play that first.  In any event, this game just... underwhelms. It's basically a visual novel with some basic gameplay thrown in to appease those people who claim that simply reading text 'isn't a game', but the problem is that all it does is create a minor obstacle course to slow the player down in between text segments. Since all you do is use the arrow keys, it basically amounts to being told to push the same couple buttons with some general sense of timing to avoid the bad things, but since you're more focused on the WAITING than the timing, it lacks all the appeal of a rythym game. It's more like those stealth games where all you do is wait for an immobile guard to just turn a different direction, and where you have no tools at all.   But this surely leaves the stronger point of the game, the story in the visual novel, right? Well...  There's two parts of the plot of the game, the actual unhacking part, and the character drama part.   Unhacking gives you zero sense of actually being the master hacker the characters all seem to think you are. There isn't any discussion of getting past firewalls, no vulnerability exploitation, at one point, your character is apparently hacking into a computer without even realizing he wasn't invited, because apparently, hacking is so like signing into an instant messenger service that even a pro can't tell the difference. You delete viruses by stepping onto green tiles to fire 'blasters'. It's not even presented as an abstraction for actually doing real hacking, the way a lot of games throw in hacking minigames, they're telling you to 'defend the core by firing those blasters'.   As for the characters, well, they're undermined by the stilted dialogue. Weedy has stiff, formal, and frequently awkward English. The dialogue is written like someone still learning English as a second language. And oh God, Ms. Debug's catchphrase is the immesurably irritating 'Yawnies'.   The plot relies heavily upon being invested in the characters enough that you care when yet more 'shocking swerves' you could see coming half the story away are revealed. The problem is, the dramatic points are so cheesy and predictable that you can't help but roll your eyes and know that everything will be OK at the end, because there's just no way they're selling a really gripping story of loss like this. Since the story is so short, there's also basically no chance to develop the characters at all outside the first chapter or two, and that's only Weedy and the player character. You can sum up the characters with just a couple gags or catchphrases they continuously repeat. (Weedy: Forever declined, A2: It's A-squared!, Debug: Yawnies, Unhacker: costume mod.) The only thing I could remember about A2 beginning to end was just that they apparently just put Hatsune Miku in skimpier clothing for their rival. They aren't even two-dimensional personalities, they're bullet points.   To be honest, I think it would have been better without the gameplay elements, so that they could have spent more time actually giving this thing a story and setting up a way to actually deliver the drama. Everything is just the same character portraits in front of purple hexagons with flatly delivered 'I will destroy you all,' 'Oh noes!'-type dialogue, and at least showing some variation in artwork would have done SOMETHING. The entire 'game part' of this game is just a timewaster distraction to pad out an anemic story. That's... really saying something.",

The gameplay itself is simplistic, the UI gives little to no indication of progress, the art is amateurish, and the characters are poorly written and one dimensional.  Also, if I hear the Miss Debug character SAY '*Yawnies*' instead of actually yawning one more time, I'm going to slit my wrists. I get it, she's sleepy. LET IT GO. Quite possibly the most annoying character trait in a videogame since ...no, this wins. Nothing comes close.  It's also very short. I'm not sure if that's a positive or a negative. Not worth the asking price. Hopefully anything else this developer does going forward is significantly better thanks to the practice they got in on what I really hope is their first game.",
