Of course, enter doesn't work, neither does space, neither does the mouse. The only way to figure out it is 'j' is to hit all the buttons on your keyboard. In the short tutorial game when you start the game on easy the tutorial text disappears randomly so you can't read it while the lady beats you up and you're trying to figure out which keys to hit for what. There are too many good games to waste my time trying to find out how to play this one. The gameplay itself is standard for a fighting game. The graphic style doesn't resonate with me either.",

Granted my personal reaction time plays a role in the decision, however, the demand for a quick reaction time is still rather quick. When other gamers have said that this game is hard, they're not lying. If you love challenging games then this is for you.",
