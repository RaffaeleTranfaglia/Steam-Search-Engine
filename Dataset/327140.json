I can see his POV from my monitor but have no idea what he's painting, everything is mostly white. He stops, crawls forward a few feet then stands up to look back at his painting. It's an igloo. His very first time using VR and trying Tilt Brush, the kid immediately understood he could build 3D inhabitable objects. Then he crawled back inside. I died, this kid blew my mind.﻿",

            "review_text": "  I got this game with my HTC Vive, and it is truly incredible. It's always one of the first games I launch when I show friends and family VR.   As a full time Animator, I can say that Tilt Brush is definitely no Photoshop, but I think that people will look back on this program as what started artistic VR 'games.' It's funny that I say 'I'm going to play Tilt Brush' and not 'I'm going to use Tilt Brush,' like I would with Photoshop (or GIMP, or Krita). Part of that may be because you can have any music on in the background, and certain brushes actually react and pulse with the beat! This makes the experience 10 times better, as gimmicky as it sounds.  They recently added support for loading in obj files and exporting fbx files, which is quite cool. There is a LOT of potential there.  At the time of writing, Tilt Brush is Windows only, which is a downside for me since I'm moving over to Linux. I wonder if anyone's got it working with WINE?   If you didn't get this for free, I would definitely recommend buying it. It will change the way you think about creating art.",

            "review_text": "While it can be really fun and even people like me who can't draw can create something that looks really cool, it can also be really frustrating and just overall leaves the impression that this software was rushed out to be out for the launch of the Vive.   Tilt Brush wants to be a software to create art, but in that regard it's missing quite a few essential features like layers or selection tools. For example, if you do the sensible thing and save frequently you will likely end up with about 20 saves of the same project. not only that, but you can't name them and will end up with a bunch of 'untitled' files.  This in turn makes me save less frequent, or not at all until the project is finished, which causes a lot of frustration because of the software's frequent crashes and freezes. It also doesn't ask you 'are you sure?' if you want to clear the canvas, so better not hit that button by accident.  Technically you can integrate a chat window to communicate with viewers if you decide to stream, however you're limited to only Twitch and Youtube. The obvious option, Picarto, is not anywhere to be found. and even if you decide to connect a twitch chat, you can't do that inside the game. you need to write a .cfg File and place it in your documents/tiltbrush folder. there is an example file buried in the game's support folder in the steam directory (why isn't it in the documents folder?) but I didn't know that, and actually needed the help of a friend to write that file.   Ingame you can take snapshots of your creations with your controller acting as a camera. however, by default there will be a watermark on your pictures, same goes for the video feed for streams. Again, there is no option ingame to disable that watermark. You again need to write a .cfg file. Just a reminder, this thing costs 30 bucks.  There's also no way to share your creations outside of snapshots, gifs and videos. Steam Workshop would have been an obvious option, but nope. you need to grab the .tilt file, (all of which are named 'untitled' and have no thumbnail) and send it to your friends yourself.  So yeah, overall I sadly can't recommend this game in it's current state.  +Can be really fun +A handful of environements to draw in (moon/snowman/mannequin) +some chat integration  -Missing essential features like layers, selecting -Chat integration limited to Twitch and Youtube -Watermark on by default unless you write a .cfg file -Crashes frequently -No Workshop integration for sharing artwork",

Maybe they could get on that too. Thanks.  There are a couple of things that I think could improve this software tremendously:  1. Letting you bind shortcuts onto other buttons of the remote, (maybe put the redo and undo commands on the bumpers of the remote you're painting with). Maybe you could have a shortcut that switches between your last brush.  2. I would also like to see some sort of fill tool, and a shape tool, instead of hapharzadly painting flat feathery strokes into a monstrous sphere.  3. A way to move the brush strokes you made.",

Some of the artists working on Tilt Brush are really talented. But anybody can make something nice and 'impress him/herself' with Tilt brush. My 5 years old did fantastic environments, and enjoyed herself tremendously drawing rainbows, grass on the floor, neon-coloured princesses, etc...  I think some features are missing to make it really worth buying at the current price:  - 'solid' brushes (to make tubes and other 3d shapes with a planar cross-section)  - layers  - dynamic light sources  But anyhow, it's really a great piece of software that can only be recommended.
