Its crafting system is great, although you can't make new items, you can break apart others to upgrade items. The magic system is FANTASTIC! It is much like magicka. You take runes with different abilities like fire, water, earth, etc. then make your own spell, projectile, charm, summon, or whatever.  I explored this whole game in singleplayer and enjoyed it, but it even has a multiplayer which is just icing on the cake. It is much like an MMO with people in the server doing their own things. It is co op but also offers a deathmatch mode. There are missions, shops, and roles to play in online.  This is a great game and I really recommend it. The only thing I didn't like was the final boss, but didn't really care because I was too busy having a great time 55 hours in one playthrough. Didn't even do all the sidequests. Still a ton to explore.",

Therefore making this game a visually pleasing and fun to play. I haven't encountered any bugs, so, so far so good.   The game lacks 'something' but cant put my finger on what that 'something' is. The keyboard mapping is confusing such as sprint and sneak are the same button. You need to stand still and press RMB for sneak and move and press RMB to sprint. So the keyboard layout it a bit weird. The prologue took 45 minutes to complete... I think 1 hour ingame until I was able to free roam!   However once you get to free roam it can be very enjoyable, there map is relitevly large and you do get a horse about 3 hours of gameplay in.. The map doesnt require a horse though as you recieve a teleport pad at the end of the prologue so you can fast travel to locations you've already discovered.  Make sure you keep up with you crafting and enchanting as you level up rather quickly, therefore so do you foes. So dont do a me and get slaughtered and wonder why... 'Oh, I am using a damage 10 sword when I couldve upgraded it to 40 by now.'  Once you understand what you're doing in the game, such as how to craft and how to dismantle items to game becomes rather enjoybale.   I havent played too much of the story to give a verdict, but on the whole for £2, I am really enjoying this game, I would say the game is worth about... £6. I wouldnt spend more than that, when Skyrim is only about £10 these days. (I have a MAC so this was my alternative to Skyrim).",

There is no skill involved and no most enemies will wreck you in seconds. Also im gonna put the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ horse in here too. they tried to make it realistic by having you have to kick it to move (like in real life) but its overly clunky and you can't seem to get the high jump you need to vault over obstacles. They also mapped dismounting and jumping to the same key which means im jumping repeatedly when i want to get off. I know you need to wait for the energy bar to go down on the horse but it just makes it even more of a clunky decision 3. some of the most awkward animations ive seen in a while. this is 2011 and i know this was outdated back then",

The graphics are horrible, the hair's alpha layer is messed up and looks like they have a drier sheet in their hair. The framerate can be anywhere from 60 to 10 in the blink of an eye. The controls are horrible and unresponsive at best. The combat does not feel rewarding in the slightest, you hold left mouse and you win; your attacks cancel the enemies attack animation, and you attacks cannot be staggered. The game has DRM as far as the eye can see, you have to enter several serial codes, give away your addrss, your email, your name, your computer specs to allow them to detect if it's on a different device, which will trigger the DRM if you so much as upgrade your ram or hard drive.",

The story is decent, the voice acting works, it gets a bad rep for being a little different. Also, the AI is hilarious. Sometimes enemies brutally murder you, other times they are completely helpless. It's random and fun.  The graphics are fantastic, the combat system is unique, often difficult to master, but very rewarding. There are no 'classes'. You just level up and choose where to put your points. You can spec in one type of combat, and you should, but that being said, mages can assasinate using stealth attacks and warriors can summon demons to fight with them. Rangers can snipe and shoot multiple arrows at the same time (and actually aim them at different targets), and the lockpicking system rocks. Mages MAKE THEIR OWN ♥♥♥♥ING SPELLS. Oh and the alchemy rivals that of the witcher and TES.  It's open world, multiplayer (in an entirely different RTS game mode which is sweet), the graphics are gorgeous, the combat system shines, the loot system rocks, you can use a demon eye to float around and scout ahead of you.  Did I mention you can be an actual Bard?? As in, you buy an instrument, and then sheet music, and you get to actually play it. Each instrument has a different style, which you play in a guitar hero like fashion. You can play the drums, the harp, the violin, the flute, and the guitar. The drums are the easiest, and the guitar is the hardest. If you play in crowds, you will actually gain money from the people, depending on your score. Being a bard is so awesome I've literally paused my questing and done nothing else but play, just to try and master it since the moment I discovered it.  Seriously, you are going to want to give this B-sider a shot. Just beware, it's really hard. I play on Easy and it's still a challenge.",

At max settings, the environmental graphics can almost be breath-taking at times, especially the ambient lighting and textures. The same cannot be said of the character models, which aren't ugly exactly, but they have wooden faces and movements. Wooden animations also plague the fighting along with terrible MMO combat and the clunky feeling of the controls. The spell casting seems weak and not very effective. The story is not original, its been done before with a few different twists here and there, but doesn't compel me to want to continue. Riding horseback is as slow as molasses, you can move faster on foot. It might look decent, but the underlying mechanics of the game are just flawed. Its clunky and glitchy like the first game, with a boring cliche' story. It has the same ridiculous Reality Pump DRM and you have to input a key and activate before you can play the game. They want your name, address, telephone number, DOB, gender, and e-mail address. It seemed extremely over the top intrusive considering its on Steam and I'm not going to play the multiplayer part.

            "review_text": "Two Worlds was an interesting fantasy game, it was flawed but there were objects and systems in it that I really liked. Two Worlds 2 picks up a little bit after where the original left off and you are still just as much in the dark as the first one. Gandohar is doing somethin evil, but his motives are never really explained nor what has happened in between the two games.  One thing that really bugs me about this game is that a lot of the things in this game have to be worked around and serve no purpose other than to make things needlessly difficult. For example, spell usage in the previous game was a useful way to mix swordplay with elemental attacks and healing to save you from death. In this game spells can only be used with a staff and the system for using spells in convoluted and requires lots of study and experimentation. Spell cards can be bought, but they are ridiculously expensive.  Movement is blockier, akward, and running is hard to control or stop. Horse riding can help you cover long patches of land quickly, but the horse is hard to turn and jump with, and you can easily lose track of him while on foot.  Finally, the overlay system of the last game (which let you combine two of the same weapons or armor pieces to make an improved version) is replaced with a crafting system where gear is improved with materials found by breaking down other gear. While not worse than the old system, it's still another unessecary thing to worry about.  Overall, I would reccomend you play the first game before you play this one otherwise you may be unhappy with the systems and mechanics and not give it a try.",

The Function keys were difficult to remember like F7 for map when I am used to M on other games but I dealt with that ok. I remembered how the game went in the past and things were coming back to me on how to play it. What stopped me from continuing to play was the fact that the game crashed too often. What I mean is that I would be questing, then I wanted to bring up my map to look at my location and instead the game wouuld put me on the desktop. This happened too often and so I tried to deal with it by saving frequently but it got annoying. I would not recommend this game because of this fact. It wasn't just the map function, it happened on other functions like bringing up my skills, etc. Strange, I don't remember this problem when I played the game in the past from the disk.",

So if you have anything else to play, you are going to ask yourself why you should play this one. It does not give you a reason early enough. I will out myself that I put in two hours and like 10mins was character creation. The short rating is that the game has stale dialogue, clunky combat, uninteresting characters, and little motivation to push through the tutorial.   Cons - The dialogue is cheesy... but not in a fun cheesy way but like in an 'I am dark and isolated but not really' sort of way - The controls were not really made for the PC. The controls are clunky and stupid... just saying - The game isn’t optimized well… had random needless unexplained stuttering in empty dungeons.  - Needless running in empty hallways in between cinemas. Just play the full cinema instead of having me come in and out for no reason. You literally watch a cinema then walk through an empty room and have another cinema… this is not an exaggeration. - The character creation seemed extremely limited. Basically 10 different choices in each category (plus sliders). So I suppose if you spend a lot of time you can make a very customized character… but I didn’t see any of the features I look for. For example, facial hair options are basically all the same (i.e. short goatee ish beard). Hair options are basically the same length with slightly different styles… very slightly. No facial paint/tattoos. I know I started with I spent 10 minutes on character creation… but honestly it was less than that. - Not sure if this is a fair con or not so I add it only to mention it but the story appears to be heavily dependent on the first game… so a lot is not explained.   Pros - Sexy Orc woman who finally helps you understand D&amp;D Half-Orcs - A craft system exist… so that’s good - Variety of combat style (typical though: magic, range, melee).  - Interesting lock-picking system - Magic system based on cards.  - Not really a pro but another worth mentioned… all the women I encountered so far are scantily dressed women who hold their own… so there is that  I wish I could recommend this game because there seems to be so much potential but that game felt more like a chore than a game… yes first world problems.

Another positive point is the crafting system, you can keep improving stuff you like for a good while until you reach an actual upgrade, and as stated before, friends make it fun.  Grab it when it's cheap, 10 bucks is too much, but 5 dollars seems alright for a fun game with friends.  Single player hurts to play through, but is tolerable.

So first off I'm going to base this review on the multiplayer primarily, even though it's not the main focus of the game. Just because of the 70+ hours, 60 or so have been in MP.  When you first start MP you are given the choice between varying classes/subclasses. These include a fighter, ranger and mage with subclasses for the fighter and the mage. The subs change various skills and make the player more proficient in different combat styles/magic.  Once you enter the your character you can join a European hub server. There are 50 of these each able to hold... 50 players? Not actually sure on that. But once you connect you'll join a small city market district where you'll see other players. From here you can look at shops and meet others. You can then proceed to create a lobby and select a game mode you want to play.  As adventure mode is the one I've primarily played I'll be talking about it exclusively.  It's a story based coop mode that has small-mid open world maps linked one after each other based on a narrative. As far as I'm aware you are playing the role of someone serving the main antagonist of the singleplayer. Once you start a game it becomes a listen server and the one who hosted the game is now the host of the server.  The combat in the game is... hard to get into, for some. I personally don't mind it, though I wish it did have a back step like the first one. (It might but I'm just blanking on it.) It's a lock-on style combat where one enemy is selected at a time. You are given 3-6 skills on your hotbar to use. In normal stance you can only use three, but holding down right clock changes them to another 2-3.  Too lazy to continue.

I am nowhere near the end of the expansion but after the amount of time invested I felt compelled to race in with good word before this game is lost to Steam's dungeon archives and forgotten all together.  Forget what you know about the first game in the series (Two Worlds). Although it wasn't entirely a bad entry in sandbox action/adventure games it mostly certainly left a lot of room for improvement which I feel was successfully implemented in the sequel (or at least its expansion).  Now, I must warn to not to do what I did – Which was skip to the expansion immediately without playing the base game first. I warn simply for the fact that your character's achievements and equipment are meant to carry over into the expansion from the base game. If you begin Flying Fortress not carrying over anything from TW2's base; Flying Fortress will start your character with far more than your character needs greatly reducing the challenge that Flying Fortress may have otherwise offered.  Not only did I find myself starting off with the best of the best there has been very little acquired during my six hours of play (Armour or Weapons) that improved on what I had.  And this game is Loot-Heavy! The looting element in Flying Fortress is on par with the obnoxious pack-ratting found in games like Torchlight so my mistake of starting the expansion first has pretty much killed a lot of the game's excitement during exploration.  I feel the best approach continuing onwards is to relay my experience in contrast to The Elder Scrolls games which you more than likely would've asked first and foremost. To summarize: Flying Fortress has sacrificed the massive scope of TES landscapes for a grand improvement of visuals. Reality Pump appears to have aimed for enclosing more relevant and interesting material into a smaller sandbox area. Teamed with very good optimization (modern day developers please look this word up it will help your efforts tremendously!) Flying Fortress plays like a much more aesthetically appealing Skyrim that cuts to the chase.  So if I could choose either Two Worlds II or Skyrim? Skyrim simply for the fact of hosting much more content and therefor longevity. Being able to afford both, however, it would be hypocrisy for TES fans to turn their noses up to Reality Pump's entry in sandbox action/adventure genre.  Price Recommended: $20 w/ Expansion",

I was useds to the old way of playing RPG's and this new game was a little bit different. I plaued it quickly and passed up a lot of side quests in my rush to get to the end.  This was a BAD move. I soon got tired of getting killed so I put it aside. Then a friend gave me a copy of theepic edition and Two Worlds Two, I tri8ed to be patient but still had a hard time with it because it made me think out of the box, so to speak. At this time the company that was selling it would help you out if you just sent an email to support. They would help you and even give you cheat codes like the horse race against the click to finish the starvation quest.  Now after all thes years I find the yo dated T^wo Worlds Two game on sale on steam. I buy it and have trouble again with many of t6he quests like before but no help from thr conpany Except by there forum. which I had problems getting onto till just recently due to nissspeling the user name I used way back then. I am not sure I will take up the game again as I found it difficult follow the main quest because I found my self stuck in a main quest.  For example when I was facing tge son of the fire God in the swamp my level 37 fighter did not last more than a few seconds. The strat guide said 'just let him chase you around till he gets low on power then finish him off. So much for the strat guide's help. I discopvered by accident that I could fire arrows at him fasat and they would stun him and thus I could kill him with my bow, albeit it did take a long while.  I now find my self apparently done in the swamp with no way out except to take the tunnel to the castle which gives ny character about 10 seconds of life. Now this does not make sense because there is a whole big Island to explore so I must have skiped something in getting out of the swamp .  Just like when my level 26 fighter reached the top of the Tower of Fang's and could not even dent the guardian. Once again the trusty strat guide was no help. Having played this game long ago I manahed to get to New Athos by a combination of walk on water potions and swiming. When I finished enough quests to kill the guardian I returned to the tower and killed him.  Now you ask do i RECOMEND THIS GAME i WOULD GIVE YOU A RESOUNDING Y-E-S!!!. It is that is done a little bit differeently and a great game. Some of the plot twists are hard to solve but I still liked the game. I DDO NOT recomed the strat guide except it is nessasary to get back on the main quest or some of the more esoteric side quests.  The reason I have stopped playing was the possibility that would not be able to get onto the forum. Even if I do it is not the same as the old days when they actually answered an emaik sent to support@ there wep site.  Even with as the frustratin If I can get back on the forum I will give the game one more chance but I do not think I will get all the information I used to get way back when. It will be agame that I will always like even if I do not finish it.",

Two Worlds is a game like no other, the single player compaign is exciting as it is twisted, the combat system is certainly better than the elder scroll series, although the voice acting needs a lot of work. Aside from this, multiplayer compaign offers an experience like no other, not a lot of people log on now, but there still some faithful ones who are really friendly and nice people.",

BUT...  you can get it on amazon for 3,99€ together with the expansion 6,99€ i think...  And for this price you get a new boxed version with a real map inside and without advertisemnt banner in the main menu i think....   so thats the reason i wont recommend buying it on steam....check amazon or other shops ebay or something like that...much cheaper same game or even more....",

            "review_text": "Quite a solid RPG with some innovative concepts, but an engine that is really holding it back.  Pros:  - The story is good, the quests are varied and interesting and it rarely falls into the trap of 'go [x] kill [#] of [y] and come back' quests.  - The lockpicking mechanic, while introduced poorly, is probably the best I've experienced in a game.  - Massive story campaign (I'm not even 1/3 of the way through it and I've played 25 hours thus far, though I am a 'loot all the things' typpe fo player...).  - Magic system is quite unique and involved. - The poison mechanic is pretty cool. - The graphics have held up fairly well for a 3+ year old game.  - Overall an enjoyable experience that can be loosely compared to games like Skyrim, Neverwinter Nights or The Witcher (if you like those games, this is a game you should try.)  Cons:  - So many sacrifices made to keep this game on consoles. The same button is jump, open, unlock and occationally counter in fights, the same button is run and sneak... The game would have been much better as a PC only release (but I would say that about most RPGs...)  - Sneaking/assination skills are all but useless unless you're well over the level of the character you're trying to kill (even then, it's hit or miss).  - The enemies don't level with you, so it's easy to follow side quests into an area for which you are woefully unprepared, particularly early in the game. - Once you have enough picked locks under your belt, 90% of the chests are locked with the highest level of lock possible, even in abandoned houses, as I said earlier, the lock-pick mechanic is excellent, but it gets tedious after a while. - The walk/run/turn and general character handling can be frustrating at times and it makes it difficult to move around at times. - Fall damage from pretty much any height.  It's a solid game, and if you do enjoy the Elder Scrolls, NWN and Witcher series it's worth playing (but please do not expect exactly those experiences.) A better engine and fewer compromises for consoles would have drastically improved the output, but the experience is a solid one.  7/10 ",

I'm no authority on the genre, but the combat and magic system, for example, actually offers a superior level of fun in some ways than that of titans like Skyrim, IMHO.  The musical 'mini-game' deserves a paragraph unto itself. It's Medieval Guitar Hero, with song arrangements that are actually quite inspired and a surprising joy to dabble in with the various bards-at-large in the realm.  But at the end of the day, TWII seems kind of hamstrung by flat voice acting, repetitive sound design, and a maddeningly middle-of-the-road stance on how seriously it wants to be taken.  At times this tongue-in-cheek, knowing stance works in the game's — and the gamer's — favour, giving it a disarmingly approachable feel for an 'epic' RPG. At other moments, however, you may find yourself desperately wishing it could make up its mind to stop pulling punches and fully embrace one way or the other.",

In the first few minutes of the game, you start out in a prison (hm, in which RPG have we seen this before?) and you immediately notice that the human models are really ugly, the animations are clunky and the voice acting is even worse. I could not really care for the storyline. Oh, nearly forgot to mention the UI...  The combat system takes some getting used to. Especially in the early game you will die A LOT. The areas in the world do not scale with your level (as far as I've seen), so you will probably die to a one-hit from a Grom a few times on the starter island. I focused on the melee type of combat, switching between two one-handers and a two-handed weapon, depending on the stats. It should be possible to play a hybrid warrior/ranger/mage, but it will probably make you a lot weaker. I should mention that you need to wield a staff in order to cast spells, but you can easily switch between 3 sets of gear.  Character customization is pretty well done. You can upgrade all your gear (if you invest skillpoints into the blacksmithing skills) using raw materials that you gather by breaking down your useless items. You can add gems to your equipment and combine gems to make them stronger. You can even apply some paint to your armor, but I did not really feel the need. The graphics are fine and the athmosphere in the game is pretty nice, especially dungeons look nice and dark (better than Oblivion imo).  I nearly finished Chapter 1 and I'm not sure what the end-game will look like, but so far the game looks interesting enough to keep playing. Overall, pretty average RPG, well worth sinking a few hours/euros into.",

I'm on attempt # 213,379 of Jade's run 01, and if I hear that smug idiot Sambu's voice one more time I'm going to put a gun in my mouth. It has without a doubt, the worst....and I mean, THE WORST, horse riding I've ever seen in any game ever. If it was as good as Red Dead Redemption, I wouldn't even be writing this. But it is SOOOOOOOO bad. It's jerky and awkward, unresponsive, picking up the items on the run is almost impossible without stopping---which makes you that much more rushed because there is no room for error. That run is calculated down to the micro second. They must have had a bunch of testers all do the run and took the best time someone got and used that as the time to win by. Oh, and of course there's enemies in the villages to mess you up even more. Getting back on your horse is cumbersome and awkward, especially if there's something else for your dude to lock on to, like an enemy or an alchemy ingredient. It's all just so....painful. I'll need to go to the hospital after this session to get my hand put in a cast because of my frequent slamming of it on the desk.  Anyway, as for the rest of the game, it's a vast improvement over the first one. The magic system is really cool and you can make some very interesting spells. Graphics are quite a step up, levelling is easier, generally it's all better. It's just....that horse racing, I can't get over how much I despise it. Well, back at it for attempt #213,380, hopefully it's the last one....well, it will be because I hate Sambu SO MUCH, I'll probably off myself after this next try if I don't complete it.",

The inventory is messy, and always remains opened after you loot something for some reason, so everytime you loot, you need to close down your inventory before you can move again... So very practical and not annoying at all when you just killed several monsters :S.  Only thing I did like, up to some extent, is the alchemy. You can make stuff and save your reciepe. Nothing truly new or innovative, but it's been missing for a few years now.  Crafting otherwise is nothing new or spectacular. Grab some items, dismantle them to get some raw materials, then upgrade the ones you want of the same kind. So neither good or bad, it is fairly standard.  The dialogues at the beginning and end of combat are awfully annoying and repetitive... there seem to only be like 3 of each :S.  The controls are weird and slow. During combat, there seem to be some delay between doing something, and actually doing it, the combat itself is awfully slow, boring, and for ranged classes, if you have not killed the mob before it gets within its own range, you're most likely ♥♥♥♥ed I'm afraid.   It seems to take the basic D&amp;D classes, and just dump them there. Thing is, without a group, most ranged classes would have a really tough time. And this seems to be what's happening here. The game becomes awfully boring, because some enemies are next to impossible to do with ranged classes :(.  I have not tried melee yet, considering how boring I feel while playing this game, I don't think I ever will.  TLDR: This is not an elder scroll game, and it is not a good clone of it either.",
