            "review_text": "Fun homage to the 2D classics. I like that the plot doesn't take itself seriously but still has character and momentum. Here's what it does well:    aliens have unique styles and tactics. My favorites are the humanoid that splits in half as it's damaged and the spinning koosh ball death hamster things. The bosses are huge and menacing, kind of like Contra villains.    maps that build the alien station into fun and distinct regions (a la Castlevania/Metroid).    excellent art for a one-man shop. It's a combination of digitized hand-drawn and pixelated art. Some sprites are more polished than others, but the overall tone and feel is solid.    weapons with different use cases: regular and upgraded laser, regular and upgraded sword, and, by far my favorite, the grenade launcher. I think there are others that I haven't found yet.    Overall: Fun game and solid design. At first, I found it on the difficult side, but once I got into it, got sucked in. There's a lot to explore and find in here. Worth it for the price. ",

            "review_text": "This game might have the least appealing artwork of any game I've played; so much so that it's almost charming in its own way. But look past that and you'll find a very competent Metroid clone for a really cheap price. Yes, it's low budget. It makes no attempt to hide that. It is a cheap, low budget game, with low budget visuals, low budget physics, low budget everything. But I had plenty of fun with it.",
