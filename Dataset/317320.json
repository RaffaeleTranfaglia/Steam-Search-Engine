Top notch production (with SUPERLATIVE voice acting and music), great puzzles and design, and wonderful story/characters with some of the funniest dialogue from a videogame yet. A must-play for any fan of this genre!  EDIT: Just now officially completed the game, lemme tell you BIG SMILE ON MY FACE! I will say at around 5 or so hours it's a bit short, but in my own personal opinion it's better to go short than to outstay your welcome. This is gonna go down as one of my top of 2016 for sure, and I CANNOT WAIT for the next Nelly Cootalot game, fantastic effort all around, pick this game up today!",

Im probably not paying enough atteniton ^^b",

            "review_text": "Nelly Cootalot: The Fowl Fleet is a delightful adventure game with fantastic humor, a surprisingly large cast of characters (with great voice acting), and puzzles which are, indeed, quite fair. What difficulty there is generally just comes from the game's 'main' middle area which is the largest, and simply has an awful lot to explore and look through before you can get a good handle on what your goals are. If you ever do feel at a loss for what to do, the game thoughtfully allows you to ask your sidekick Sebastian, who will provide some pointers. It's a great touch. The game follows the Lucasarts philosophy of adventure games, so it's impossible to get into a no-win situation.  The main draw really is the humor, and the excellent delivery with which the lines are generally given. Tom Baker, as Sebastian, is of course great, but Nelly Cootalot herself is voiced flawlessly, and it was a treat to have her as the protagonist. There were many times I laughed out loud (for real!), and many lines I couldn't resist sharing with friends.  Anyway: highly recommended if you enjoy this kind of adventure game. I'm looking forward to any more Nelly Cootalot adventures which may find their way to release!",
