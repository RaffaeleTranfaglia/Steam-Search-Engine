            "review_text": "  Refunct had caught my attention some weeks before the summer sale, and it came as a great surprise when I got it gifted by a great friend of mine, thank you once again Danii!  This is the prime example of simplicity. The game's simple aesthetic with day/night cycles makes it a beautiful looking experience to screenshot dozens of times. it's definitely not a game for everyone, by reading the game's description you know exactly what you're going to play. Refunct has no story, and barely any sort of context as well, but is it good? Yes it is.  To put it simply, all you do is press red buttons in order to restore this island that's lost in the middle of a never ending ocean and every platform you walk onto turns green, so in a way you're restoring this island back to life. You also have these little cube collectibles scattered throughout the island to collect. All of these elements are required to reach a 100% completion on the game. There's gameplay mechanics that reminded me of games like Mirror's Edge, like sliding and wall jumping so you can reach certain platforms more easily. Beware that the game lasts only about half an hour, although it's definitely not a game that should had been longer.  One of the highest positive aspects in this game is it's soundtrack. Composed by Kristofferson, the album entitled Connections plays while you're restoring the island. It is definitely a very relaxing set of music, that improves the gameplay experience a lot.  It is hard to write much about a game so simple and so short, but all I can tell you is that if you're a fan of the so called Walking Simulator genre, which I am a big fan of, if you want to play something very relaxing and if you love a really good looking game, then you're in for a treat! Again I do say, Refunct is not a game for everyone, some might not even call it a game for some reason, but for me it's an amazing one.  What makes you, you?  9/10",

            "review_text": "I avoid platformers like the plague. I have two left hands, my coordination skills are zero, and I've been forced to stop playing many games in the past because of a tricky sequence in the middle of a gameplay advertised as casual-friendly. I know about double jumps and wall jumping, I'm just bad at it, period.  This game is the greatest experience I've ever had in a platformer, because it manages to speak both to hardened speedrunners and beginners. It's short, it's beautiful, and it's not TOO hard. You can finish it carefully in an hour or so, or speedrun it in a few minutes by taking tricky jumps. I ran a first playthrough where I couldn't get to a platform because of wall jumping, and on the second playthrough I made it on my first try. The game silently encourages you to try and try again. Failure simply means trying again immediately. And in the end I finished 100% a platforming game for the first time in my life, without cheating, and feeling satisfied about myself. Thank you, guys. The world needs more relaxing platformers like this.  Note: unlike what guides tell you, the 'make everything green' achievement also requires getting all cubes. I know you normally should have all cubes by that time, but I'd missed one on a platform I'd already greenified. Also, the lack of tutorial is okay, but they really should tell you about the Shift key to crouch or jump into water.",

While this didn't really hit the hardcore part of me like other games do, it certainly was an enjoyable experience and is well worth it for the price.  The pastel colors are well used and remain vibrant even without the use of neon bright flashy graphics of many other indie games.   If the developers of this game would like to continue working on the game and add new content, then I would love to give some suggestions (these arn't going to be the best descriptions) :  -Add more diffuculty -Add randomly generated worlds  That's actually about it. I would love if these were added, even in paid dlc (as long as the price is fair.)  Either way, it's a good game",

Grass texture seems to be a generic free seamless grass texture I've seen somewhere on the internet before (and a desaturated version of it). Platforming is slippery and threw me off a couple of times. In the beginning of the game mechanics convinced me I have a 'double jump' ability (not an actual 'bouncing off walls' ability).

With many different platforming structures such as lifts, springs, pipes and wall jumps, the game is easy to learn and fun to play.  PROS + Immersive + Stunning Visuals + Casual + Easy To Pickup + Achievements + Controller Support + Steam Trading Cards + Cheap + Beautiful Soundtrack  CONS - Short (Estimated Time: 40 minutes to 1 hour) - No User Created Levels - Not Much To Do After You Finish  CONCLUSION With a calming atmosphere and stunning visuals, the whole concept is just soothing. Most people would assume that a game that you could finish in less than an hour is a lack luster game is completely wrong, it is an immersive world with a wonderful soundtrack and an easy to learn game. With no tutorial slowing the game down, you get pushed in head first into this world. That may sound scary to some, but you are eased into the different platforming abilities that it's easy to pick up on.  8.5/10",

            "review_text": "The current torrent of AAA releases makes for an overwhelming selection for a reviewer like myself. There are titles that we’re simply expected to play, like one I shall not mention until this time next week, and others which only appeal to a very certain demographic. Indeed that’s exactly why all these games can all launch at the same time and still find the financial success they were looking for. However most of these games are incredible time sinks and my one review a week schedule simply can’t accomodate them. Thus I look to the poor indies who found themselves in the mix with the giants of the industry to fill the gap with their shorter, more concise experiences. Refunct certainly fills the first requirement aptly clocking in as probably the quickest game I’ve ever fully completed.  Refunct Review Screenshot Wallpaper Opening Scene  Refunct is a first person platforming game, something which I’m sure strikes fear into the hearts of all gamers. You see platforming in first person has always been somewhat of a hit and miss affair, both in the literal and figurative sense. Judging distances in first person mode is a flawed endeavour as there’s no real way (apart from trial and error) to figure out how far your character can move or whether or not you jumped too early. Refunct however has billed itself as a game that everyone can play, meaning that the developer must think they’ve addressed the first person platforming problems. To an extent they have, but not because of any new or clever mechanics.  Instead Refunct is incredibly generous with its hit detection when it comes to near misses on ledges and the height that you character can jump. For the first few jumps I was expecting the normal platforming behaviour, you don’t make it you fall flat on your face, however if you’re within a certain tolerance your character will pull themselves up. Later on, when its revealed that you can push yourself off walls, you can exploit this somewhat as even full misses can result in a successful jump if you bounce yourself off the wall. For new players this means that jumping puzzles, which typically rely on pinpoint precision, are much more forgiving. For power players like myself though it’s an easily exploitable system that significantly reduces the play time of Refunct.  Refunct uses the Unreal engine and, judging by the world effects it makes generous use of, must be running on the latest version of said engine. Whilst it’s one of the most basic games you’re ever likely to come across, pretty much everything is a block or cylinder, it does look incredibly nice. The subtle day/night cycles, clouds gently passing by in the background and the accompanying soundtrack do make for a rather pleasant experience. That being said in terms of graphics it’s not much more than a demonstration of Unreal’s inbuilt capabilities. I guess where I’m going this is: I like the way Refunct looks but it feels like a low amount of effort went into making it look that way.  From a game play perspective Refunct is pretty seamless with the generous platforming mechanic smoothing over what could have been many frustrating moments. At the same time however this means that for any kind of regular gamer Refunct is likely to be little more than a curious distraction as I was able to complete the whole thing, to 100%, in no less than 22 minutes. For some this might be a problem, especially in the age of numerous other $2 games that give many more hours of play time, so it’s something to bear in mind if a simplistic first person platformer is sounding like something you’d like to play.  Refunct is a succinct first person platformer that is far more forgiving than its genre would lead you to believe. The generous platforming mechanics means that a wide variety of players would be able to play it start to finish without the frustration that accompanies nearly every other title that incorporates such mechanics. It simple and clean aesthetic does make for a kind of zen experience which is only heightened by it’s great soundtrack. However it is a brutally short experience, almost shorter than the time it will take many to download it. Overall I’d recommend it but only if you’re looking for an after-AAA mint to clean your pallet before you set yourself up for your next meal.  Rating: 7.5/10  Refunct is available on PC right now for $2.99. Total play time was 22 minutes with 100% of the achievements unlocked.",

Lovely atmosphere - the game is minimal but still has a feel of its own. I enjoyed the ending (which was also minimal).  Cons:  This game has huge unrealised potential. It is cheap and it is worth the price, but it is so frustrating to see a successful concept that doesn't realise its full potential. What would it take to do that? A few more levels and a couple more gizmos in addition to the elevators/pipes(under-ulitised)/bounce plates. Maybe a few weeks of development time and this game would be 10x better.

Basically, it's a platform puzzle game where you do standard platform puzzle game problem solving, except it doesn't feel that way. It never feels like there's obstacles or challenges, just things to do because they're there, and I mean that in a good way. The game design is fenomenal, right from the start you're in the game, no long-♥♥♥ intro, just the game. Everything is explained in a really organic way; you do a thing, you see the result. Step on the ground, it turns green, step on a button, something happens. It's all immediate and obvious. I really hope whoever made this gets some work for this, because this is some of the best level design I've seen in a long time.  The graphics are simple, but still nice. The light, shading and day/night cycle combined with the music makes for a really nice presentation. It's short, but not too short.  To sum up; if you're looking for a good, solid gaming experience where game play is the only thing that matters, this is a game for you. This is a game every gamer should play at least once.",

I don't usually like first-person platformers but this game was (like Portal and Portal 2) very comfortable to jump around in.  Lovely atmosphere - the game is minimal but still has a feel of its own. I enjoyed the ending (which was also minimal).  Cons:  This game has huge unrealised potential. It is cheap and it is worth the price, but it is so frustrating to see a successful concept that doesn't realise its full potential. What would it take to do that? A few more levels and a couple more gizmos in addition to the elevators/pipes(under-ulitised)/bounce plates. Maybe a few weeks of development time and this game would be 10x better. I completed the game in 50 minutes - this game could easily supply four or five times that length with minimal investment.  Bottom line: Worth the cost, but you might be left frustrated by what this game could have been, but isn't.",

You repeat the process for about 20 min, and that is it! Worth it? Yeah! Something in the way the game flows + the music + the simple colors make it relaxing and really enjoyable!",

It's easy to get a learn of without any tips or tutorials, but it's also seems to appeal to speed runners and all. The only draw back I do find is that some of the basic sounds like walking/swimming are generic, but those are minor things to the game, it's wonderful.",

It's a great relaxing little first person platformer, but lacks anything particularly meaningful to resonate with you after you've finished, and lacks a reason to come back again.",
