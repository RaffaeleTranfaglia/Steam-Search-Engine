            "review_text": "  Alright, so having played Slither.io and knowing full well that this is a clone of Slither.io... I went into this game already not expecting too much. As you can see I don't have much time spent in this game, I played about 15-20 minutes and that is pretty much all I could handle of it. The creators of this game also have a very awful clone of Agar.io called Mitos.is. So, this game is very clearly a port to steam from mobile, and we all know how clones of clones of clones of original games run rampant on mobile game stores, this is no exception. Though there were a couple things about this game that I liked and I will state them below in a list starting with the good.  THE GOOD:  - Multiple Game Modes (something Slither.io does not have) - Apparently this game has levels, upgrades, and pets. (something Slither.io does not have)  THE BAD:  - I was blasted with an ad immediately upon starting the game bribing me with coins for a rating. - Clear and shameless clone of Slither.io with not enough originality to make it acceptable. - Worse graphics than Slither.io - Chat... which is stupid, I challenge you to type without dying while playing this. - Chat requires an account with them, yeah no thanks. - No steam integration... you have to actually sign up with them for your own Screen Name, it does not automatically use your steam name like most other steam games. - Poor English, an example is when I came in second in 'Hunger Games' and got a message saying 'You Are Second Position' - Your snake/worm does not grow past a certain unimpressive size unlike Slither.io where you become terrifyingly large. - My ears were molested by dubstep the entire time I was playing this. - Hit Boxes are bugged, sometimes you will die when you feel like you made no contact, sometimes you can literally crawl right over another worm without dying. - The UI is messy at best, and the whole thing looks incredibly unappealing to the eye.  This game is not only an uncreative clone, but its subpar in comparison to the orginal... very very little effort went into this game period. Why steam allowed this rubbish is beyond me. ",

Download something and play it in the background. This game isn't worth wasting your time on. This really makes me worry about the gaming community, not the players, but the small developers. We've seen good games made by small devs with original ideas, but this game isn't one of them.The only difference between slither.io and worm.is, is the fact that worm.is has supposed microtransactions. So long story short? The creators here seem to have the creativity of a COD playing 12 year old that doesn't like doing their chores so they end up relying on others to do their stuff for them.",

The hitbox detection is much better in worm.is, with little ambiguity when you run into somebody. It never feels like you've been cheated, whereas in slither.io this is often the case as the hitboxes are smaller than the worms themselves.  There is significantly less lag and stutter in worm.is than slither.io. The ability to choose server is also nice.  One downside is that the pace of the game feels slower in worm.is, the acceleration of the worms is just not very fast. slither.io definitely feels more fast paced. Additionally, the map still feels rather small compared to slither.io.  I started playing after the May 7th update, so perhaps this has fixed many of the issues which older reviews have mentioned.",

When a snake dies, a random orb from its body has 5 cents. So you kill 4 snakes that didnt kill anybody and you get 20 cents, in total you have 25 cents if you die you get 12 cents, other enemy snakes search for your other 12 cents. If you add this game will become really addictive. Have a server that minimum to enter is 1 cent, 2nd server with 5 cents, 3rd with 10, 4th with 50 cents, 5th with $1, 6th with $5 and 7th with $10. So you deposit money from either paypal, debit card or SMS, choose to enter a server that requires X amount, use your skill to get money and at the end withdraw instantly.

The major con of course is that the snake graphics don't look so good, like they were done in MS paint. But with skins, they look excellent. The floor graphics can also do for a makeover. Maybe there's a mod or something. I'll explore that option later.  This is a definite Let's Play.",
