            "review_text": "'Here i find myself in the midst of chaos,but everything breaks if exposed to enough pressure' listening to that and watching the static cinema that came with it i thought i was in a 'MAX PAYNE' game,but no i was in the rather enjoyable and action packed shooter that is 'SPLATTER : BLOOD RED EDITION'. Ok when you start to play you wake up in your house and after some rambling to yourself wander of outside,*BANG* bullets everywhere and the army telling you to get of the street you follow them and then you get to find your first weapon the obligatory hand gun (which has infinite ammo,of course it does DUH). As the game progressess you gain acess to more powerfull and impressive weapons (shotgun,rocket launcher ECT) and trust me when i tell you,you are going to need them as some of the boss battles and even some of the normal battles (you do get over run at times) get quite hard and the enemy can overwhelm you if you use the wrong weapon. Now the most easiest and best way to help from getting overcome is to throw a flare,see the dark abomination's you face have a fear and total dislike of the light ('wonder where we have seen this game play element before' 'i dont know ALAN,WAKE up') which can give you time to re-gather your thoughts and blow them away whilst they scuttle away from the bright and painfull light that encompasses them.This game play mechanic is one that you will use to your advantage on numerous occasions and will save your neck more than once. As the game plays on you will encounter some puzzles but they are usually of the push button variety and are allways easy to overcome and you will never feel lost as to what to do next and this is a good thing as the action should (and does) take a front seat to all else in game. The graphics in game do a good job and for this sort of game handle really well with no lag no matter how many enemies are on screen (shouldent be in this sort of game),the music in game is good but at times you do find that the spoken dialogue is overshadowed by the music or the gunfire happening in game (minor quibble but i did miss out on some conversations due to this). The story and script are both good and at times you do feel like you are in a different game (MAX PAYNE anyone),but at times it does feel all a little B-MOVIE but actually this is not a bad thing and does suit this game right down to the ground. Will you play this game and would you want to even buy it,well enjoy a game that is all bang for its buck and want something that will itch those trigger finger blues then i would say yes,if that doesnt sound like you and you want more from your game than gun blasting action then i would say look elswhere. In my humble opinion this is one enjoyable blast and i would fully reccomend it just dont expect it to be one of the best games you have ever played just one of the best blasters you have ever played and enjoy it for what it is 'ONE HELL OF A BLASTING GOOD TIME' ",

            "review_text": "It's a good budget title. Just note that the game works best when you disable v-sync. I had it on and was topping at 20FPS, turned it off and went up to a steady 60FPS throughout the entire game. Aside from that it was a good game. Plays like a top down twin stick shooter and feels like a resident evil game with the atmosphere, the monsters and even the cheesy dialogue. Although once the story mode is over, there is not much to go back on. There is survival mode where you take on hordes of zombies and monsters but it gets repetitive after a while. I rate this a 7/10.",

            "review_text": "I've heard this game compared to Hotline Miami, but to me it's much less twitchy and re-playing-based than that game. I would compare it to Max Payne in Left 4 Dead from a top down perspective. So it's fun and it's also got cool cut scenes and themeing.   Everything you want in a twin stick shooter    Difficult. It's not easy, especially when you don't have flares yet. To be honest I had to bump it down to easy mode and still died now and then. But it's better to be challenged than to be bored, in my book.    Style. This game is very stylish and I love that.    Humor. It's not wackyrandom or jokey but dark narration and tone really bring a grin to your face, especially when the protagonist gets worked up.    Action. So much blood. Blood everywhere. So much shooting. So much destructible items. So much explosions.    Multiplayer. Local co-op, or local versus. Online leader boards for everything.     Arcade mode. Twin stick shooters are arcade games, really, so I always hope to see arcade mode.    Controller support. I use a Steam controller and it works great. Although I did find the community profile to work better than the default, for aiming.   Production values. Voice acted throughout, this doesn't look like a AAA game but it doesn't have the cut corners you see on many indie top down games.   TLDR: it's a good one and a good price. Install it if you own it and give it a spin!",

It's a simple story, you play a guy who lives in an area overrun by monsters and you have to shoot your way out of it. The addition of control pad support is very helpful. It's a easy game to pick up and play and just have some mindless fun.  The graphics are strong for the style of game with lighting and a color fade to B/W when you're hurt standing out as cool effects.   All in all, this is a fun game that is worth giving a go to espc if you enjoy old school top down shooters.",

            "review_text": "I played it, i tried to like it, but i couldn't manage to handle the problems and bugs i encountered during my play.  First, as a personal note, i didn't liked the story:    a cynical character, always wearing a fedora and a black jacket, scornful towards humans and spiders, but at the same time trying to help the survivors of the first race to survive against the zombie pandemic. But we won't know from our protagonist why he is doing so; as for this, many cutscenes may leave us without important pieces of history, expecially when the story progresses after the introduction of our 'hero'. And also, what do we have as the final boss, the villain that is the cause of the pandemic in this story? Cthulu... I'm sick to death of these myths already, thank you plot.     Nothing new or different that you can find from a tale for babies.  The second biggest and worse problem involves it's gameplay, where you already find out how the game becomes bugged at some point:    the harvester 'boss' was it's first sign, where    i struggled to let the fight progress, as to defeat this boss it's needed to move him first, but most of the times it just standed in it's place, or instead of charging me, it flinched. Yes, instead of charging to me, it just moved away from me.    The Worm boss was another fight of this kind, where    it stucked at some place while it was moving around the place of the fight, covering it's only weakspot.  The last problem, but not the least, that annoyed me alot and accompanied me most of the time of the gameplay, was the low health screen warning; as i were pretty experienced in top-down-shooter games, i tried to start the game at the biggest level of difficulty available, and still now i regret that choice, not for the difficulty itself, that wasn't anyway that hard, but for the change of the screen's colors to a very bright white and a low black when your health reaches around the 30%. It was a damn pain in the eyes, curable with the few medikits scarred around the levels, which weren't easy to find in these bad colors in a top-down visual. They could've at least allow an option to disable this 'feature', but they didn't.  My experience were painful and tedious, and so is my opinion of this game: Bad and Tedious.",

            "review_text": "HOLD ON I know what you're thinking this looks like some throwaway steam title right? Like something you'd play for 30 minutes then forget you ever bought it? Wrong. This game is honestly one of the most well done top-down shooters I've ever played, especially in the last few years. It has hints of SAS Zombies and a bit of Zombie Shooter, but the story! Oh god where to begin.  The game is brutally difficult, even on the normal setting. You'll be rewarded for exploration and secret-hunting, like if you get the 8 golden gun parts you won't need to spend money on upgrades.  Each gun has 4 upgrades, which cost 300, 500, 750, and 1000 each. Looking for money is very useful.  The zombies and various creatures are afraid of flares, and some weapons can be upgraded to use tracer rounds and magnesium bullets to startle them.  The boss fights are incredible, i'e played at least 3 hours so far and I'm not even near to finishing all the upgrades and modes, but I think the campaign is 5 hours long but there's tons of bonus modes i haven't even gotten into  The game is very gory and actually quite good looking. it reminds me of the graphics from the upcoming title, The Hong Kong Massacre, and at max settings it works flawlessly and looks fantastic.  Along the way you'll be forced to make moral choices, most of these are just side missions but they are always quite rewarding and sometimes they are the only way to get all the upgrade parts and secrets.  The game is worth the 9 bucks you spend and honestly I've enjoyed this game about as much as Hotline Miami and even more than alien/zombie shooter thanks to the in-depth story, great voice acting and cutscenes and the white-hot shooting.  The only downside to this game is the amount of time you will waste playing it, and the difficulty. The game, I'm assuming, can be played multiple times and there's even a hotseat 4-person coop, and survival modes. The combat is fierce and you will die in 4 hits from zombies most of the time.  Honestly? I'm very, very glad I got this game. I play mostly fps games and this was exactly the something different I was looking for. If you're into shooting games and want something as intense as Killing Floor with the story of, say, Max Payne, then you'll probably love this game.",

With that said, I suppose this game's pretty fun if you like shooting things. It's repetitive and when it does try to switch things up it relies on instant hordes spawn and leaving you clueless as to what you're supposed to be doing. But all in all, fun enough if you like this sort of thing, especially for the price. I recommend it.    ORIGINAL REVIEW: I like the way that you get stuck on scenery in the busy backgrounds, and I especially like the way the screen tints when you've taken some damage so you can't possibly tell what's going on. Two thumbs up out of five.   Die, die, die. In case you can't tell, I truly hate you.",

There is a progression system in the form of an extensive range of upgrades for your weapons; by the end of the game you'll have collected 7 weapons in total and there are four upgrades per weapon, each of which affects said weapon in a different way. Money is limited so you won't be able to upgrade everything, which creates some replay value. It should take you around 6 to 7 hours to beat on the hardest difficulty.  Would reccommend for some mindless fun.",
