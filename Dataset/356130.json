You can upgrade your cards with the fake money you make on the sight, along with extra slots as your levels increase. This is a bit of a stradegy kinda game/ puzzle but you'll figure it out. Do feel like the tutorial could use a little work, you guys. But just play in training mode for a little while and go to a real game. Will be fine and dandy. 10/10. I like the game a lot.",

            "review_text": "Start with 3 trash cards.. Fight people who have paid money for rare cards.. Rare cards will have similar cost to deploy as your cards. but twice the hp and attack. One mows though 4 of your cards   Feel relief as your 4 minions finished off his first minion., and altnough yours only has 10% health left, its still alive. Realise that your opponent already has another 4 more minoins on the way.. and there is nothing you can do to stop them.  Recieve no new cards, because you only gain a reward card when you win.   Pros - If you are willing to spend 50$ on this game, you will have a good chance at building an incredable deck that will stomp every single non-paying player. If your not against a new player thats ok, you will likely still have fun with a fair 1v1 match.  Cons - If you are reading this, you are likely one of those non-paying players that is going to get stomped constantly.",
