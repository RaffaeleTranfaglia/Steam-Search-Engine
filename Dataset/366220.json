            "review_text": "11/10 Would milk male Bison again.  Wurm....oh where do I start??!?  So, I've played Wurm Online (The MMO version of WU) And have had Amazing stories in the living, breathing world. Good and bad, of course. Was it worth it though? Yes...So much yes. Especially with the friends I made. (hey! :D)  If you've played the game,.. Well, WU is basically WO...With full customization at our control.   Wurm is a Sandbox....For me, it's 'THE' Sandbox. And now that it's released it's own stand-alone version, where I can mod the game to my liking, It's trully - Finally - The game i've been waiting for.  With over a 100 skills (I'm not sure the exact amount) you can bet you will find many that you will enjoy, I won't lie though, be warned, Some (Like beverages) Have little use currently. (There ARE uses, just not much) And some skills have this problem. But once mods are made, I can't imagine what this will become.  However, there are PLENTY that work. Blacksmithing, Woodcutting, Carpentry, Weaponsmithing, Fishing, Mining, this list doesn't really stop. most skills involve what we call 'Imping' - Which is improving your tools, weapons, armour, gear, vehicles, Ect. The higher the 'quality' of a item, the better it performs in it's task. and the less damage it takes while in-use. I can assure you one thing, You can-not find a better crafting game right now. And I don't think you will for a VERY long time. this game lives, and breathes, because of the crafting.  Now, in WO (Wurm online) The skill gain is very slow, it takes years to level up skills, and only a hand-full of people have hit '100' in a skill. However, WU you'll be able to set your own speed, So if you wish - You can have it slow, Or you can speed it up. it's YOUR choice! (Default speed on WU is 10x that of WO) - As a side note, The higher your skill, the better you can craft things /Improve them. At very low skill, lets say for example 30, it would be very hard to improve a item over 40.  The World: Everythings destroyable. Every tree, Every mountain. Want to dig down 500 feet? Well, if your servers that big. go for it!! Terraforming in this game was hard to understand at first (For me) But after a while, it got so much fun. You and the players build it, are you in the middle of a huge landmass in a lake, but want to connect it to the ocean? it may take a while, but you can dig/surface mine a 'canal' To the ocean, so boats can enter!  Each tree is one that randomaly generates, or you plant. You can 'pick sprouts' from trees, 'prune' them to let them live longer, ect. Forestry/gardening is one of my favorite skills. I love creating my own forest for the world.  Trasportation? Yep. we got that. Horses with saddles/horseshoes/bardings to increase speed, armour, turning. ect.  Carts, Large and small, Wagons, and multiple boats (Caravel, Cog, Knarr, ect) I personally am not a huge fan of sailing, as it's pretty slow, but (Again!) we get to change that up in our own servers. :)  Combat: Combat is a bit odd, and I really want mods to improve/overhaul this. The combat is, basically, clicking on a button for where you will aim (The head? The legs? Ect) and same for blocking. The good thing is, aiming at area's have benefits.....For example, if your in PVP and you hit a guy hard in the foot, he will start moving slower.   There IS archery and spells, However, I will warn you - It's not exactly a 'main combat' role at the moment. Mods again, are likely to change this. Archery REALLY needs to be easier to use as it's a button-click fest right now. Spells are only 'supportive' in combat, and not really a main fighting style.   And we have a 'God' system in wurm, This is a very big part of the game, as we have 'missions' (sort-of like quest that random-generate) to do things for them for karma (used in spells) and sleep bonus (used for gaining double exp for a short time) Also, you can become a follower of one that gives some benefits. You can also become a priest, Which allows you to enchant weapons, armour, and tools for special effects (Increased speed-of-use, More damage, More experience gain, Ect) I really can't wait to see what mods come out for priest...and new spells. :D Also, champions. basically a better version of a priest, but limited in number on server. They're mainly used for combat - they're the big PVP guys you want to kill first! or you will face the wrath of there gods abilitys.   EDIT TO PRIEST: Priest (Not champions) by default are limited in what they can do, For example, Vynora priest can't mine, dig, ect. though they can cut trees, farm, ect (each priest has different can-do and can-not. All priest are not allowed to 'Imp' things. However, in WU you can change this to have different/no restrictions if desired. Champions do NOT have these restrictions, despite being able to cast spells ect.   CONS?   Bugs, Lots of weird, little bugs. I have very few issues personally, but some players have a lot. (For example, a large cart on some players screen will appear 10 feet away from where it really is...) Or doors not opening (usually due to server lag, though) Nothing to big usually, But a bit of annoyance at times.  Animations aren't the greatest. I really wish there was more, and 'better' of what we have.  Character models feel odd because of the animations. They also could have a model improvement IMO, however, they don't look to bad. (Also, some of the gear for them actually does look pretty sick!, that's not a con obviously :P )  Default speed of WO (which Isn't the same as WU) is pretty slow for the normal player. WU is a lot faster from what I've seen so far. But the game isn't like, For example, Ark. it's slow. I personally Like this, as it gives a sense of accomplishment. The good news is, however, that if you DON'T like this, you can speed it up as much as you like, and where you like. (Or the server you join can)    If you want a REAL sandbox, One that REALLY let's you do what you want...... I can't say there is a better game out there. Since I found wurm, I've not found one even come close (and I've tried at times) And with being able to mod WU, really anything is possible. I'd highly recommend.   IF you have any questions regarding Wurm at all, I'd love to help if able! Pm or comment and I'll see if I can help. And, please, If you agree or disagree with this review, please say so! I would love to hear other peoples opinions on this game, good or bad. I wish I could share the storys i've had in this game, because I've had so many. Especially with all the friends I've made.   TLDR: Highly Recommend to anyone looking for the 'true' Sandbox. Especially with WU being moddable.   Edit: Also like to state, i've played wurm since 2012, which isn't long at all compared to most members. But in that time I quickly grasped the game and have gotten to the point now where I can self-sustain all my things at 90ql and do my own enchants. Most people specialize, I personally, can't. My minds all over the place. So if you only like a few skills, or only a few interest you - Don't worry. The skills have a LOT in them that you can spend, literally, years with. or, if your interested in all of them......you can easily do all of them! (You aren't limited to skills, UNLESS you priest! I will add info to the priest section on this)",

            "review_text": "I'm writing this review based on two things: - My 4+ years of playing Wurm Online - The 16 hours I have played Wurm Unlimited  To start, Wurm is one of the best games I have ever played. The community in Wurm Online was always great, minus a few griefers here and there. It has one of the most in-depth crafting systems I have ever seen. And what makes it even better is that you can do anything you want to the world. Want to flatten that mountain or hill over there? Do it! (Although it might take you a while). Want to build a large canal connecting two bodies of water? You can do that! Want to convert a scorpion covered desert into a lush green forest? That can be done. This is probably the single most important reason I stuck with Wurm Online for so long.   Another thing I like about Wurm is the graphics. Yes, I know some of you are thinking 'How can you like the graphics?'.. But it's not so much about comparing it to current game graphics, obviously current graphics are superior. But that is something that gives this game character.  The next thing I want to talk about is the UI and controls. I've noticed a lot of people complaining about these, and I don't understand why it is such a bad thing. Yes, the UI might take a while to get used to, but once you get used to it, it isn't bad at all. Same goes for having to click and drag to look around. I understand most first person games do not do this. But once you get used to it, it isn't bad.  Last thing I want to address is the learning curve. I will admit, it is very steep. But it can help a lot if you play with someone who knows how to play. When I first started Wurm Online, I think it took me over a week of playing to finally grasp most of the basic concepts. But I am glad I didn't give up, because it is one of the most fun and relaxing games to play in my opinion. So my advice to all noobs out there, don't give up just because it's hard. If you work hard and learn, it will be very rewarding.  My summary of Wurm Unlimited:  Pros: - Very relaxing. - In-depth crafting system. - Worlds are plenty large enough for a good amount of people. - You can host your own servers for solo/playing with friends. - You no longer need to pay for premium like in Wurm Online. - You can have full control over the server settings, such as no upkeep, skill gain, etc...  Cons: - For noobs, there is a steep learning curve. - There are some bugs that I have ran into, such as mounting/dismounting horses crashing my game.  All in all, this is a good game for those who are willing to spend some time working in the game. For those who aren't, you can join a server with higher skill gain. Hope this review helps! Have fun and see you in Wurm!",

            "review_text": "It's Wurm Online, without the subscription fee!  Why aren't you playing it already?!  Survive in a medieval era world, craft everything, build your dream home with different material types and styles, cook food, drink water, train yourself to get better at making higher quality items... It's a builder/PvE sandbox lover's fantasy.  I played Wurm Online for a year but felt that it was too expensive to maintain each month, with premium membership fees AND deed upkeep costs. Now those problems are a thing of the past, and the game was always solid as a rock, so I can't fault it there!  Highly recommended - 9/10  If you're on the fence about the purchase, try it free on the MMO version 'Wurm Online'. Google it, download the client and enjoy! =)",

            "review_text": "Wurm Unlimited is one of those gems that's not for everybody. I had mixed feelings about giving this game a thumbs up or down, but only because of it's price tag. I'll get to that a bit later though.  First thing's first. Going into this game I knew to expect a few things. This game is from the early 2000's, which means the graphics were going to be severly dated by todays standards. I also knew this game wasn't for the faint of heart. It's not your typical survival game, and it doesn't pull it's punches. This was quite evident when I first entered the world, spawning almost direcly on top of a spider which proceeded to slaughter me without remorse and then camp my corpse.  Ok, so I mentioned a bit about graphics. This game is pretty dated as far as the graphics go. If you can't look past that then you really won't enjoy what this gem of a game truly has to offer. Being an all-around gamer I found this to be not so bad. In fact, there are many aspects of the graphics that I actually really like. Little details, like fish swimming in the water, are very nicely done.  The interface of this game will frustrate the hell out of a lot of the newer generation of gamers. Most of your actions are done via right-click menus and require you to have certain items or tools 'activated' before the right-click menu will give you the options your looking for. For example, having a hand saw activated and right-clicking a log in your inventory will give you completely different crafting options than if you had a knife activated. That said, once you get the hang of the interface you can actually see it's really well designed for the level of detail and openness this game offers.  It's hard to judge the world of this game, having not seen all of it yet myself and also knowing that you can use custom worlds with a little tweaking. It seemed very 'real', as if the map was created naturally rather than by a person at a computer. The jist of it is that there are 3 kingoms on opposing sides of the map and they expand their territories as much as they can, eventually meeting each other and then... Well, that's open to whatever the players want do at that point. They can be diplomatic and trade lands for other lands, they can war and attempt to take land from the other kingdoms, or they can just live peacefully with their current borders. There are goals to the game, with 'winning' being an option, but depending on what style of server you play on those goals can either be important or not.  Now we get to crafting. This is where this game REALLY gets some major points. The crafting system is incredibly indepth, as mentioned earlier. It's so indepth that you can't actually craft a lump of metal, which you have already smelted, unless it's reheated to a 'glowing' state. In addition, the more indepth a crafted object is the more resources and crafting stages it requires. Example, to build a guard tower you have to first build the base of the tower, which is easy. Then you have to add 500 stone blocks (a crafted item), 500 clay, and 100 planks (a crafted item) before the tower is finished. This is a HUGE task! Another example would be a knife. You can't simply place a lump of ore on a stick and call it a knife (lookin at you Minecraft). You have to craft the knife blade out of metal, and then a handle from wood, and put the two together to finally make the knife. Crafting materials and requirements seemed very logical, almost 'real'. That seems to be the theme of this game, bring as much reality to it as you can, while not loosing the fact that it's a fantasy game.  In addition to crafting, the materials of the world didn't come in numbered items. For example, if you picked up a rock you didn't have 1 rock. You had so many kg of rock. Each time you crafted something it took a portion of that rock to craft it. You could also have many rocks, of various weights. Some might be too small to craft an item with, some might be big enough to have leftover. They could also be combined to merge their individual portions into one larger portion. So you could have one rock that is 10kg and another that is 20kg, merge them together and get a 30kg rock. The weight of items was very important to monitor, as your movement speed didn't just go from 100% to encumbered. There were actually multiple stages to walking speed. So carrying 40% of your maximum weight would actually have an impact on the speed you walked, again very realistic.  So getting down to the nitty gritty. What is Wurm Unlimited? Well, it's a very good MMO, in a fantasy setting, including a high detail of realism, that's been converted to home use. If it's just you playing it you'll find the world very empty and a lot of things will be a very difficult challenge. If it's you and a few friends there is quite a bit of enjoyment to be found, although the 3 kingdom aspect of the game will probably never be used. If it's you and a dedicated server of 30+ players you might be able to experience all this game has to offer.  So do I recommend it? This is where the difficulty is. For a player such as myself, who loves a challenge and doesn't mind tedious grunt work to get a task done, this game is absolutely awesome. For the newer generation of (spoiled) players who like to press one key and click one button to get stuff done this game will come across as boring and very hard to play. Personally though I absolutely love this game for it's mix of realistic crafting, true sandbox environent, and RPG aspects.  So again, do I recommend it? Oy... It's extremely hard to decide. If I was to look at this game 10 years ago, at it's current price, I'd think it was a hell of a deal. Today, not so sure. Personally I think $32 is fairly overpriced. That said, I got it on the Steam Sale for $16 which is a much more reasonable cost. So?  Yes... Yes, I recommend it. ---- BUT ---- Only if you can get it on sale at 50% off it's $32 price tag.",

            "review_text": "After years of playing repeating MMOs (grind grind grind) My friends and I finally found a game that put the adventure back. This game gives you nothing, you will have to earn it. It's not that hard to figure out and you will love the rewards x10 compared to the other games that are now days making it to easy. No you wont get to power level. You cant buy your way in. Your gonna get dropped into a world face first with a compass and a few supplies to get you by. Its getting dark outside so you better run to a city. But wait, you hear a wolf growl from the bushes, you start to run but you are bitten in the leg. Turning your back WU gives the wolf a advantage since you turned. Secondly it not just , you took 23 damage please heal, oh no its WAY more detailed. Your gonna need to find some cotton and bandage that wound. But it also depends on where the wound is and what type. You see your right leg is bleeding out and infection is sure to come. This game is ok on graphics and fighting, but the hidden treasure is in the details. Theres a skill for everything you can think of, sometimes branches of 2 to 3 skills for one thing. Anytime you make something, your skill effects the quality. You got to get to know people and trade, because you dont have npc shops that sell stuff, only venders owned by players. I'll have to say I am alittle spooked sometimes, the game seems to have some witchcraft in it. It has gods to choose from, altars, animal sacrificing,ect. You can also breed animals, groom them, tame them, sell them, eat them, ride them. Any trade you can think of is in the game and broken down into many parts and it wont be easy. But after you put in the time to be the best at that niche people start coming to you and buying. I went from rock bottom to having a nice little town in about 3 weeks. But in that time I dug dug and dug and my friends dug and we sold the dirt to some rich guy down the street. He needs the dirt for building. We started out with a little hand cart that carried 40 dirt a trip. After becoming friends with the guy, he built us a large cart and then a wagon capable of hauling 3600 dirt. We bought some land and hired some guards that now run around and kill those wolfs. I'd have to call it more of a simulator then a game. It could use some work on the graphics end, but im thinking thats why I dont have hardly any lag issues. I also don't see alot of bugs. Yeah there must be a few, but for all the stuff thats going on in this game they have really put alot of work into making it solid.",

By design everything takes time to do, and that is what makes it rewarding.  Wurm Online is one of the best sandbox games in the world, but I am one who does not like monthly subscription fees and believes that players should be the ones to host servers. For me Wurm Unlimited is a step in the right direction. The dedicated server was surprisingly easy to get set up and I had mine up and running about 45 minutes after the game launched on steam.  The actual gameplay is just as slow as Wurm Online, this is a plus in my book, but can be tweeked to speed up the skill rates. The game runs smoother than I was expecting and I have not had any real issues with it at all. If you are looking for a game in which you feel like you are actually building a house wooden plank by wooden plank, this is your best option. It is also great for those who like PvP or fighting powerfull monsters.",

Since then I've built a mansion, planted acres of crops, and run from some trolls (the green kind, not the internet kind). If you like being rewarded for your hard work, you will be sucked in to Wurm. You could become a renowned blacksmith, or a master carpenter, or simply a labourer working to pay your keep. You could become a great chef, who serves his catch of the day with potatoes and rice grown in his garden. You could become a lumberjack, living in solitude deep in the woods, growing all manner of trees in her groves. You could become a devout priest to your god, provinding blessings and curses for the right coin. You could become an architect, not just of structures, but of the very earth itself. Or you could be all of these things and more. You have total control over the world, it's up to you to chose what to do with it.",

            "review_text": "Preface: This has been my first experience playing a ' sandbox/MMO ' game - ever! So, steep learning curve-you betcha. This will be more for the novices like me. If I can do it anyone can. This may not be for everyone. It's NOT x-box or PS4 it's much more. If you notice, the negative reviews came after only playing 2 or even .5 hrs. In all fairness, you can't get a true feel of a game of this complexity in such a short time.   Likes: This is an awsome game. I think the graphics are very good-again not ps4 but wait till you see your first baby lamb or foal you breed, they're sooo cute. From the realistic clouds,thunderstorms w/lightning bolts to the snow flakes in winter, it's all good. Some say the game play is to slow, I disagree. Working to improve your skills so that you can build say, a row boat (which is invaluable by the way) gives you a greater appreciation for where you started and where you are now. It also addes to the angst when going up against a nasty old bear, knowing you might loose the tools you worked so hard to make and improve and some of your skill gain if the bear kills you. I even feel my heartbeat quicken with the uncertainty of the outcome - now that's game immersion. I'm just now getting into the community aspect of the game, pretty sure I'll like that. I caught an 11.02 kg catfish yesterday and wanted to compare notes w/my fellow wurmians on their biggest fish.   Nuts &amp; Bolts: as I understand them. 1st, Wurm Online-has existed 10+ yrs. Has official deticated servers that will probably never be shut down or wiped to play on-this is a plus. It has deed costs and upkeep costs payable with 'in game' money (silver coins) which you purchase at the 'wurm online store' or earn selling goods or services to other wurmians. Please bare w/me. You also must purchse 'premium time' if you want to raise your skill level above 20.  2cd, Wurm Unlimited - basicly plays the same as wurm online but w/these differences. You purchase the game upfront. Once installed you have 3 ways to access a server/severs to play on, 1 - the game comes with the ability to manage yout own lan server. This is fairly easy to set up, although I had to go to a link with step by step instructions (remember NOVICE) and it connects thru steam so you have to have an internet connection. Does'nt have to be great, I'm playing on DSL. You can password this server so only your friends can join you or open it to the public. You can adjust certain aspects of game play like - up to 10 x skill gain. This is simply-you will get 10x the skill gain for the action you are performing as oposed to the original wurm online. Lastly I believe there is a spirit templer (deed guards) mantainence cost according to how many you have. Again not sure but my settlement info says there is. 2- You can manage your server offline. This is harder to set up - I don't know how but there are no costs and you will be the only one in this world. 3- You can play on someone elses server if it's open to the pubic or you have the password, It may or may not have upkeep costs, it's up to the host of the server.    Dislikes: Not much in the way of clear and concise information on what the game is or how to set up it's different capabilities or the true costs. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind the upkeep costs, yes it's a revenue stream but the hosts equipment that stays on 24/7 - 365 has cost too. Plus it keeps 3 people from deeding the entire map. I still have'nt figured out how to fund my settlement that's about to be disbanded for the second time due to lack of funds, hosted by a gaming website server. Maybe it's my own ignorance but if the information was readily available I would have found it by now and there lies the source of my frustration. I will persevere, remember - if I can do it ANYONE can. Hope this helps.    ",

Every element of this sandbox is not only challenging, but provides a real sense of accomplishment to those that are looking for a long-term sandbox game; not a fleeting experience.  The survival system is complex and very reasonable, the crafting system is deep and complex enough to keep a sandbox enthusiast very engaged and interested. You can claim property, tame wild-life, farm, and build a village to a city with impunity; anything from boats, ships, transportation carts, pavement, defenses, tools, weapons, armor, houses, etc.  One might be initially mentally blocked due the graphics, but if you put deep and rich game-play and game-play mechanics ahead of that, then this is worth the look.  Many very dedicated private server owners are ex-Wurm Online players, and they are there for the long-term. ",

This game is quite addictive and therefore needs quite a lot of time to be played even if you tweak the settings, but if you tweak them too much you will feel like you cheated, so I would advise buying the game only if you have enough free time or are on holiday. I would also recommend playing with at least one friend to make things faster.  So buy this game if you feel you have enough free time, are a minecraft survival fan and like beeing able to do whatever you want in a game (as opposed to playing stupid linear games), it's definitely worth buying it !",

Also highly recommended for those who wanted more out Wurm but could not do so. While there is no official/unofficial Modding API yet, the game is extendable in so many ways, given you know some Java.  I have personally have played Wurm Online for 9 years and not having any sort of alternative is what kept me around so long because there is no other game like it. Some games have came close to its terraforming system but never achieved the same result. Its crafting system is also very unique with a player driven economy based on the items created from its one-of-a-kind crafting system.   I highly recommend Wurm Unlimited for those looking for a standalone experience with no limitations or subscription fees, or those who are simply looking for a better community than any Wurm Online server offers.",

I`ve only played 179 hours (at the time of writing this so I`m not that far in the game jet, but wow, this game got some serious depth to it. The graphics look good, but both the crafting system and the UI is something to get used to for sure, but once you do get used to it there is nothing to complain about. And whatever you do, whatever project you start it will feel slow as heck in the beginning but it WILL get faster and better as you level up your skills, and when you finally finish the project, big or small you will feel rewarded for all that hard labour.  My plus &amp; minuses:  + Nice graphics. + Deep crafting and skill system. + Great community (best I`ve ever experienced) (server). + thousands of things to craft and even more to do. + And so much more!  - Animations are getting old. - Can be a bit repetitive. - UI looks to be from the 80`s.  All-in-all a great game worth every cent! If you want a game you can play for months on end this game is for you! It is truly a gem of a game!

            "review_text": "First off, I will say that this game is not for everyone, and If you have never played Wurm Online, then I'd recommend to try it before you think about buying Wurm Unlimited.  I started playing Wurm Online sometime in late 2009/early 2010, and I loved it. However, I did think the grind was a bit too harsh, and eventually I couldn't afford to pay for premium anymore, so I quit playing. I moved on to other games, the most similar being minecraft, but nothing ever came close to Wurm for me, so I ended up logging back in every few months/years to see what's changed, but never sticking around for long because I couldn't get premium.  Now they have released Wurm Unlimited, a stand-alone, one-time payment version of the MMO, and needless to say, I was really looking forward to getting it. It's basically what I've always wanted Wurm to be, a one-time payment version that lets you do everything the game has to offer without limitation, and even lets you play on other people's servers, or even your own.  Now I guess I'll put a list of Pros/Cons.  Pros: 1. A true Sandbox game that lets you do whatever you want, wherever you want, now at your own pace since you can modify the speed at which you do things and gain skill levels. 2. Everything is made by the players. 3. Hundreds of different skills and thousands of items you can craft. 4. Maps can be gigantic, don't expect to see many people come to visit you if you manage to build somewhere on the other side of the map :P.  Cons: 1. Very large learning curve, this game is NOT noob friendly, this may be a pro to some, but if you expect to have you hand held, you will be dissapointed (unless you get into a nice village that will help you out). 2. Graphics are pretty dated, though you can still find some places with beautiful views. 3. Still has a few bugs, I haven't run across anything game breaking though, mostly just stuff to do with animations and stuff. 4. Not sure if a bug or not, but as of the time of this review, you can't play without internet access. It isn't a big deal for most, but some people may be thinking of buying this so they can play when they are without an internet connection. As of right now, you cannot.   So, if you tried Wurm Online and liked it, but thought the grind was too painful, don't want/can't pay for premium, or you just don't like MMO's and jsut want to play by yourself or with close friends, then you will most likely enjoy Wurm Unlimited. If you have NOT played Wurm Online, and Wurm Unlimited sounds interesting to you, please try Wurm Online first, it's free to try out. Don't complain in the forums or something about it cause you bought the game without researching it.",

Leave the town to set up your own home while avoiding the bad things that can keel you in one hit.   Much more fun with friends, alone this game will be highly grindy, tedious and time consuming.   The graphics are less than steller, however the content is pretty good far as crafting/building/farming etc. According to a friend you can even become a priest of a god.. somehow...   In the time I have in-game I managed to find an area with guard towers, clear and level an area, build a house, a farm, a pasture along with some decorations within the house and even got some of my farm animals to breed.   For me, not quite worth the $30 price tag  Overall I'd rate this game 7/10, still recommended for those with a friend or two to play with them.",

It' can be grindy but you can make the choice of ramping up the exp or skill timer. very good server options lots of control did I say feature rich.

I bought this game because some family play it and told me it reminds them of Ultima Online, which I played to death back in the day. However, every server disconnected me, saying denied and duplicate authentication. Running local server, playing by myself, and there were two sets of terrain, one up close to you and one that starts a few feet away. I thought it was level of detail going haywire, but it wasn't just textures, it was two separate terrains; grass turns to stone pavers, stone pavers turn to dirt, with varying heights, etc. I typically like less hassle in my games. It's not that I don't have the technical knowhow to 'figure it out' - I'm an electrical engineer that now does software... so tinkering with PCs is sort of my thing. But, I'd like to leave that stuff at the office. The graphics have aged terribly, and I understand that does not make or break a game, so just an observation.

I created a character on a few different public servers and their bodies were always stretched out and their heads moved a foot infront of their necks. This pretty much made it unplayable due to not being able to see much of anything.  On top of that I was unable to create a LAN server that I could see on the server list. I followed all of the guides and it simply didn't work out for me.  If the streaching man problem would have not occured, I may have been able to deal with not being able to have my own server, but that pushed it over the top.   If there was a simpler way to have a single player experience, and if the streatching man issues was resolved, I would definantly give this game another shot. Until then, I will not be able to recommend this.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  edit: Since posting this review I have figured out how to fix the Stretching man issue. I have also been able to play Wurm Online. From what I understand it is exactly like Wurm Unlimited in terms of gameplay. I really love the gameplay in this. And if I was only looking at the gameplay with this review, then I would be recommending it to everyone. However, singleplayer is a key aspect in Wurm Unlimited, and I was never able to get it to work despite following all of the guides. Because of this I am going to have to downvote it for now.
