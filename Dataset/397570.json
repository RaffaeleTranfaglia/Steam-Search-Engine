            "review_text": "Personal Rating: I like my game sessions short Classic Rating: ★★★☆☆  Shmadow is a simple game under every aspect but yet entertaining, if you don't mind short/casual game sessions.  It's a twin-stick shooter in a 2D environment: you are a light 'bulb' (or something along the way) and there's plenty of dark enemies coming your way.. if you leave auto-fire on, left stick moves the bulb, right stick aims and then dodge and shoot is what you'll do, as long as you can, before death comes.  Electronic Soundtrack is also very good, keeps the pace on; if you ever played 'Really Big Sky' and you liked it like I did, you'll enjoy Shmadow without any doubt. I haven't been able to play local-coop yet, but it's a thing I'll have to try, sooner or later.",

            "review_text": "This game has taught me how bad I am at twin stick bullet hell shooters.   If you're into this sort of title, I'd recommend checking it out.   There are several unique enemies and bosses, at least that I've encountered so far, which are presented in a such a way that you can tell how they work relatively quickly without having to die to them 10 times. The graphic styling and music combine to create a sense of environment while maintaining the hectic pace of a true bullet-hell. My favorite part of this release though is the global scoreboard allowing you to tell just how poorly you measure up against other players and then of course, that music!  Cool first release from Extrokold, looking forward to seeing what comes in the future and will enjoy this one from time to time when I need to blast things for a few minutes.",

Every now and then, you encounter other orbs of light - dark, sinister glowing red suns that shoot scarlet death lazers at you, and command the shadow asteroids to swarm your light ship like spherical ninja zombies.  It's clever, it's tricky, and its' simple premise lends itself well to short play sessions.  Plus, Shmadow is just fun to say. Shmadow. Shma-dough. Shh-mad-ow. SCHMA-doh. So good.",

The reason is that each playthrough last from a few seconds to a few minutes. This has to do with the super twitchy play style, which I find is great as a warmup to a good night of gaming. Get your mind focused real quick then dive into something.  It cost less the a fast food meal, what are you waiting for...",
