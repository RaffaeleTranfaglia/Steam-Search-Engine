I find looking for supplies, weapons, etc, while zombies are at every turn to be great addicting fun in this game. You can unlock things that make the game easier or harder, also you can find other survivors to join you and your HQ. The gameplay is really good and does'nt take itself so serious but still makes it great. You will need to make and find supplies to keep your group going and making their stats better. It all mixes really well.",

I quit playing this game because of this acid element.  Some zombies left acid when they die. If you step on it, you take damege, multiple times while you are on it. When your character die on acid, you would revive the character. Then revived character take acid damage, and die again sometimes. I really hate this acid element enough to write this negative review. I don't understand why this annoying element was added. This game was fun without this annoying element.",

            "review_text": "Even though this game is out of Early Access it still needs a lot of work with rebalancing and adding things. The fact that you can make a decision in a text based scenario and immediately have a team member die is baffling. Along with the fact that some areas are impossible to reach without running out of stamina even if it's maxed out. The survival mode is also a joke. It's survival in it's most primitive sense of only being in one map. If that isn't your cup of tea then all you have is a timed campaign mode. For anyone wanting a more lasting campaign there isn't a chance of that happening.",

The flash version is a good time waster, because players do not expect a polished or finished game. After the terrible console ports period, we entered the terrible flash game ports period.   your team stays on the last project they were assigned to, even if it is finished, 'auto assign' doesn't send them to a new project   melee fighters are the slowest, always at the back of the team, they are useless   exploding enemies do not damage your team   team has no formation during movement, and they change position when they stop, you can't decide who is in front, no tactivs here   team member suffer from fatigue, they move more slowly, which doubles the time needed to explore, making exploration more of a chore, but can't send them to sleep   mission info does not update : 'this place is filled with weapons' written just under 'status : depleted'   missions shown by an icon on the map, but no way to know which mission is which - where should I go for the merchant? where should I bring back the orange box?   caustic pools were added, but no pathfinding for your team, they can't avoid walking on these pools, even worse : they stand exactly in the middle of the pool and take damage   lots of micromanagement - pathfinding, limited time to do research and no sleep button, useless intermediate screens to confirm dialogues without options   merchants dialogue is worthless : 'Ok, I'll do the job', what for? either you do it or you fail the game   'dialogues' are perfectly uninteresting and unecessary   random events are shown on one screen too many, as if they needed the player to lose time on useless mouse clicking   you may choose the leader of the team (the person you need to search for ex.), but it is forgottent between maps and you have to select it again (micromanagement again)   if you want to keep your weapons charged between assaults you'll lose hundreds of bullets, handguns cost 20 to recharge event if they have 8 bullets, and you have only shot 2, DO NOT recharge your weapons   you have a set amount of stamina to visit the town - good idea, but movement + encounter + scout + explore = 4 stamina per building, which means 3 buildings at the beginning, and 4 at max stamina, OR you decide to avoid scouting, if your group is strong enough, however you risk losing the survivors you want to save during the encounter   actually you have enough stamina to go to the edge of the town, but not to go back   intro video is a heavily pixelated diaporama you can't skip   videos on the store page DO NOT correspond to the actual game  ",
