The sound effects are stilted, the music is generic, the cutscenes are sub-par, the lighting is over-saturated.  And it has a generic Unity Settings Launcher, which is just tacky.  Is this a good replacement for Wipeout? No.  Is this a good racing game? No.  Does this make it a bad game overall? No, but definitely feels disingenuous to bring this to the PC platform.",

Bad features: annoying music(it becomes that after some time), no explanation of who the characters are, I guess this is one of the games that you just run and play, but if they show some characters in there they should at least explain about them, also as I see in the store page some characters appear in screenshots, but don't be wrong there is no explanation of who they are, and I didn't saw most of them also even playing the game, lack of basic things in options like language change, bugs(developers tend to fix them, but still there are), not good race system, little confusing menu, and dead multiplayer.  Good things about the game, it has controller support, achievements, Steam Trading cards.",

Speaking of bills, I wouldn't pay full price for it but if you see it on sale it's worth a snag if you're a fan of this genre. The game could definitely use some track variety as everything ends up kind of looking the same, and the graphics and weapons aren't anything to be too wowed by, but the soundtrack is pretty awesome electronic tunes, and the gameplay is at least fluid and fast-paced. The soundtrack and speed of the game are what redeems it from being average.",

Better controller support would help too. And for the love of Zeus please turn off the auto-accelerate so it feels like a true racing game.",

I bought it on sale and id probs buy it off sale now knowing what the games like also to all the people complaining about how it doesnt have full controller support if you go into ur settings and click controller instead of the keyboard it works so maybe just check that next time you think of giving a game a bad review because of that this game is amazing and i plan to get many hours out of this i normally dont even write reviews :D Moral of this is buy this game !!!",
