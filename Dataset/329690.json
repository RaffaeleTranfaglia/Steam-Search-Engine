            "review_text": " BasketBelle is a game unlike any other. Creativity and concept is using it's maximum potential. Story gives something different than just empty words, instead promise something new and simple. Every chapter changes gameplay completely, but the main goal still remain the same - slam (jam) dunk. It's hard to classify what is going on in here, but smooth plot and sound make everything fits in. Ending give that feeling of insufficiency and after finishing BasketBelle little whisper inside me was awaken - MOAR!    'Made with love and cardboard'",

If you, like me, prefer to play it with a controller, here are the keys you need to play (using software like PGP):  Arrows x - jump mouse buttons (menu navigation) left mouse click (menu navigation) f - fullscreen toggle Esc - pause/quit Note: if you want a separate button to duck (mapped to down arrow), you could also map it to a face button on your controller.",

Would have liked more basketball-elements in the game somehow, but that would have been difficult, since it's a 2D-game.",

It's awkward and sluggish. Hitboxes and controls are inexact to the point where it's painful. And the puzzles doesn't help at all.  From a feeling of 'wow, game of the year' to literally ♥♥♥ in less then a minute.   Nice try though. It does have potential.",

The sound design is spot on with the visuals, so every action the player takes feels incredibly responsive, you could almost play this game with your eyes closed thanks to how distinct the audio cues are. I greatly appreciate the length of it as well, each level plays with a core mechanic a bit, you learn how to do something and then you move on. There's nothing repetitive about it and that's how I like my games. Doing things over and over becomes a chore and this neatly avoids that.",

The controls need work. Seems like you cant really press an arrow and jump at the same time for some strange reason. The game is very enjoyable.",
