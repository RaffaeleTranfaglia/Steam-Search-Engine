While most people decide to talk about the graphical enhancement, and the overall smoother and improved gameplay I for one will focus on what's really important, energy drinks.  As far as I can tell there are 2 different brands of energy drinks on the island, one that appears to cost $0,99 according to some advertisements you can find on the island, and one for $5. (Jump Energy really should re-consider their prices as $5 is more than I paid for this game)  Not a fan of energy drinks? well too bad, energy drinks and alcohol seems to be the only beverages you can obtain. (And yet they wonder why people are dropping dead)  You can choose between 5 different playable characters, all with different skills. You're basically 'Patient zero' as you've been bitten but have not turned, basically you're immune against the zombies or 'walkers' bites.   If that doesn't make you feel special enough as it is I'm glad to inform you that you're also immune to type 2 diabetes and heart attacks considering there's atleast one energy drink every 10 meters, and your player can jugg down a can in 3 seconds. But wait, there's more. The players can also drink an unlimited amount of energy drinks aswell, making you a role model for all no-lifers like me out there.  All that and yet your character never appears to be in need of a bathroom.   Overall great game, but I would like to see more variety of energy drinks in the future.      ",

            "review_text": "Not a full recommendation here for now, just wanted to share some thoughts. Some people might like it, others won't. I hope it does get some future updates with fixes for various stuff and complaints from the negative reviews. I'm keeping it positive.  So far im into Act1 right after we get everybody to the lifeguard station. It definitely looks much better(graphics and lighting wise) and more detailed, but it needs more work.  First my setup: * FX-6100 * 2x4GB 1600MHz DDR3 * 2GB Radeon HD7850 * ProView with max res 1680x1050@60Hz  I did quite some testing around first 2-3 missions. Most of the time i was at 'balance' preset in video seetings, vsync on. I had random fps drops also dropping to 30fps close and inside buildings and it was noticeable. Tinkering settings was not a fix for this. Instead i finally lowered res to 1440x900 and i started playing with 60fps on those same places it had drops to around 30. Not only that, but since its different resolution it has higher refresh rate and my fps went up to 75 on some places. I stayed at balanced and MSI Afterburner showed the card to be at 99% on the gpu and temps going toward 65 degrees C, around 1200MB video memory taken. CPU went up to 70% load. RAM - around 5000MB.  Some things i noticed: * They changed the standart(good old) number plates on cars. * Beach ball physics. Balls only roll for awhile when you walk into them. * Weapon trunks don't spawn stuff right away when you exit and enter game again(no more exploits i guess?). * Characters look better and more detailed. * Characters move their face(lips) more when they are talking(or is it my imagination?). * Game loading is shorter? * Different music during loading for Act1(if i'm not mistaken it's from the jungle act). * Ryder White is included, other dlcs should be. * More stuff i or someone else is yet to discover(or already has :&gt; ).  Ok, i admit i read about the first two and had to see for myself. Im not completely sure about the lips/audio sync yet. They might have changed other item physics as well. However I am sure it still needs some bug fixes. For now my biggest complaint is probably the blood fx on ground- textures are glitchy and look ugly like low res. Also the blood puddle when you kill a zombie has some strange mirror effect on the surface and looks horrible.  Using this new engine, DI is demanding. So what i would recommend if you have fps drops - find the right settings combo and most imortantly the right resolution to get higher and stable frame rates on your hardware.   Update 1: Only a few mission later...  * So far doesn't seem to be any desync between lips and audio. * Objects/items placement is a bit off. Im talking about game objects, pickup items etc. For example on the way to the light house there is a crashed bus with luggage outside. The bags are slightly glitched(placed) in the bus. This is also noticed with some chocolate bars and wallets for example. Sometimes you have to change the angle and try again in order to pick them up. Nothing game breaking, but still worth to mention imo. * Characters say additional lines, like when you drive through and successfuly kill a zombie. * You can't enter the car from left side. In original DI there was a trick when you aim for the driver seat and when button prompt appears and you press it you immediately get in that seat. Just wanted to share this one :). * Remember the mission where you have to put boxes and finish SOS sign otside the lighthouse. The places of the boxes are not white/transparent but rather blue-ish transparent. Ugh kind of hard to explain, but i think you get the picture. This is the same for all mission where you have to deliver something to e certain spot. * I noticed new names of weapons: Awe inspiring home made machete. Never seen this kind of naming in the original DI, it must be new. * Ragdoll physics are strange. When you kick dead bodies, you move them farther. While we are on topic about kicking, you know there are zombies which are dead by default, right? Sometimes when you kick them you get a 'critical' hit sign. Weird.   Update 2:  * Jin looks kind of scary. There was some noise coming from the truck, yet neither she nor her father were working on it. I'm talking about the time when you enter the workshop and before you start mission to upgrade the truck. * I was wrong about the weapon trunks/chests. But on some random occasions(i guess) there was no icon to open one or two just after i reloaded a game. * Your character doesn't have a shadow. I am sure there was one in the original DI. You could see some weird 3rd person animations thanks to that :) . * Some issues were fixed. Like the bunker where you take that russian guy from the helicopter crash. In DI there were shadows from the palm trees inside and the lighting was bad, like there was no ceiling. Nothing like that is presen in DI: DE. * More new names i dont remember from DI - debilitating baseball bat, mediocre stick, worn heavy wrench, used military machete. You can correct me if im wrong about this, or anything at all. * Ok, so the game switches back to windowed mode whenever it wants. I decided to try windowed with vsync off and at my max res 1680x1050. No framerate drops to 30. It runs better in windowed mode? Still takes a lot of juice from the card judging by the noise of the fans. Plays above 50-55 frames on balanced, in some areas above 60.   Update 3:  * It was hard to drive the armored truck in the first part of the island. The light was too bright. I don't remember being almost blinded before the upgrade. Maybe because of the armour thats taking half the windshield, i don't know. * Aaaand some more new names like - enervating slicer. Ok, i think thats enough mentioning it. * Perhaps i was a little rough when i talked about the blood fx, but i just dont like that puddle when you damage limbs/kill zombies. And the blood textures on some places on the ground don't look good and are flickering. Its like different textures are overlaping of some sort. * Great weather fx in the city. It changes from sunny with clouds to dark and raining. Wow, the rain drops effect on roads and cars is so cool and realistic. * Crashed bus model in the city is updated and so is its interior. Changes like these affect placement of other objects like pickups(as i mentioned before). For example in one of the buses there is a chocolate bar floating in the air. Its close to the floor of the bus, but not placed on any surface.   Update 4: The more i dig in...  * Some of the NPCs seem slightly changed. * Great fire fx. You can see this on crashed cars throughout the city that are burning. * Loading really is shorter imo, but as soon as you enter the game the screen is a bit blurry and gets cleared in a couple of seconds. * Someone mentioned that you can't see the base damage of a weapon when it's modified. I confirm it. Before you could see base damage + modified. * Big baseball bat is now a cricket bat model, wtf. I didn't like it as a torch. * Accepting missions has been changed. No more looking at a 'piece of paper'. Instead it is just a pop-up window on the left side. And your reward is no longer displayed. * In the police station parking lot, the car before the door has open trunk. Inside the two bags are not properly placed or rather the car model has been changed without taking care of the details. * They removed or moved some of the weapon mods. There was one for sharp weapons on the table right outside the police station. It's gone now. I haven't found it yet.   So, the more i dig in... is it worth it? I'd recommend this for fans and only on sale. It has updated visuals, lighting and effects. A bit heavy on the gpu depending on your setup. Developers might have addressed some issues and missed a lot more caused by this 'upgrade'. They changed stuff that didn't need to be. Feels like it's rushed and needed more testing.",

If you didn't like the original Dead Island or were only mildly impressed with it, the Definitive Edition won't win you over since it's essentially more of the same.

Summary This is very much like Dying Light, but at the same time quite different, A precurser to Dying Light or these days a poor man's dying light.  1. I like Zombie stuff - Dying light, Walking Dead, Fear the Walking Dead, but i never got into left for dead. 2. I haven't played that far into the game yet 3. I only played a few minutes of the original Dead Island Game - And it played for crap on my System (4k monitor, 980Ti, 16gb, Win10,6700K)  So far i am really enjoying the single player of the Definitive edition. Immersion is quite good, i am getting fairly scared at times playing the game and trying to stay alive. Leveling System - Looks Good Graphics - 10-10 considering the age of game. Great with the new engine. Wasn't so great before the Definitive. Sound and Environmental Sounds - 9-10 Controls with Xbox 360 Controller - 8-10 Not as good as Dying Light, but pretty good. A little clunky at times, it was designed for controller but just not quite as polished  Single Player Mode - 9-10 Multi - I haven't tried yet. Level Design - 9-10  I think you can't go wrong with upgrading for 3 dollars if you have the old definitive edition, not sure how much you would like to replay it, but if you haven't played before and have a modern system you owe it to yourself to spend some time.",

All these elements make for a very addictiving game, one where you sit down with the intention of only playing for an hour but remain glued to your seat for the majority of the day. Things only get crazier when you bring a long some friends for the ride because co-op is definitely where Dead Island shines.. Even though I played more than half the game solo and still loved every bit of it, I think it's worth seeking out friends to enjoy the romp through Banoi with.  As for the Definitive Edition part of this game's title... I can say after logging 14+ hours into the original Dead Island, that this edition of the game is a great improvement. The graphics are now more comparable to modern video games and the optimization is a lot better than the original Dead Island's ever was.. As far as I could tell, there is no added content with this edition of the game, but it plays a lot better/smoother over all, so there's that.  If you enjoy curb stomping zombies with friends, crafting flaming mauls that go through the undead like butter, and doing these things all on a beautiful island backdrop, then Dead Island is for you.",

            "review_text": "To look at Dead Island Definitive Edition in a purely comparative manner to the original, there wouldn’t be a whole lot to talk about, at least not in the same way comparing Resident Evil and its remake would for instance. Besides, the original was done so well as to firmly cement itself as cult classic, and secure a flock of affected souls such as myself who become emotionally distraught every time there’s a delay announced for the sequel. Great games last the test of time, and I suspect that Techland and Deep Silver know this very well because there aren’t too many titles that you could ask people to pay more money for without adding any extra gameplay. But just like thousands of other hopeless Dead Island romantics, I somehow justified doing just that, to play a game I already own... I still don’t quite understand why, but I’ve chalked it up to paying for the motivation to invest another hundred hours of my life into what is arguably still one of the best zombie games on the market.  There is something to be said about survival games that primarily rely on the use of melee weapons, and five years on I still haven’t played any that make using a rusty pipe or the humble kitchen knife to fight your way through hoards of undead, such a visceral and satisfying experience. Don’t feel like busting heads with an oar? You could just punch, kick, and stomp your way through hours and hours of content, and I bet you’d still be just as satisfied every time you hear the popping dislocation of a neck, or the splatter of wet brain every time you moosh a head with your feet. Whatever approach you decide to take, Dead Island has something for you. If you absolutely MUST have guns they are in there too, you’ll just have to play through about a quarter of the game before you can really start slinging bullets, and I have to admit that some of the modifications you can get for your guns are a lot of fun too.  Controls are a usually a pretty big part of whether I can just jump into a game and start enjoying it. I feel as though having to complete tutorials that teach you how to do basic things like jump, run and crouch are a waste of content, especially if you’re made to do some silly training exercise or other activity that prevents the game from making a bold statement straight off the bat. If your FPS game needs to have a tutorial to show people how to do simple things, then you’re making it wrong. Dead Island, however, is made properly. You wake up in your hotel room and it’s go time. All the key bindings are customisable if you want to tweak something, but essentially she’s plug and play, no tutorials, just straight into the story.  The backbone of Dead Island is Techland’s own Chrome engine, which is excellently suited to the multiplayer aspect of the game for multiple reasons. Some are integral to enjoyable gameplay, others are a little more subtle but no less important. Firstly, Chrome is able to cope well with multiple players being spread out over large areas, and when vehicles are involved, that’s very important. But it’s the way that Chrome handles online play that really stands out to me. Dead Island is a big game in terms of quests, side quests, and just exploring the map; It’s highly unlikely that a team of four players who aren’t at a LAN party are going to finish even the main quest line in one sitting. So what Chrome does is to allow players to drop in and out of the host’s game as they please, and providing that they are up to the same point as the host in their character’s single player campaign, whatever progress they make while playing together online, will carry over. If the host drops out, no worries, the next player in the queue seamlessly takes over as host without any halt to play. This might seem like a pretty straightforward and logical feature, but it’s one that is surprisingly uncommon in co-op games.  If the lengthy main quest, or staggering number of side quests aren’t enough to keep you occupied, Dead Island has some huge and colourful environments to explore. There are some awesome opportunities for screenshots, and Easter Eggs galore to keep you searching every inch of the map in order to find everything that is crammed into this game. If colour isn’t your thing, then you can hold off for the dank tunnel systems, or the gritty streets of Port Moresby. There really is something for everyone in this game. With the remastering of the Definitive Edition, Techland have honed the lighting and motion effects. This not only adds extra life to the different environments with lens flares and the like, but also adds another layer of detail to combat. The first time I was grabbed by a zombie playing the remaster, I was genuinely impressed by the extra detail they have been able to squeeze in. I am very unhappy, however, that I can’t kick beach balls like I used to.  Dead Island Definitive Edition is certainly not, “Just another zombie game.” Dead Island is a cult classic. There are moments of brilliance in this game that are unforgettable because they are so ridiculously over the top, but then might be followed up with something that strikes at the core of your being. And that’s what I love most about Dead Island - it’s a game of paradoxes. The weapons, the accents, and the borderline nudity, leads you to think that it’s all pretty light-hearted fun like an 80’s horror film; but then BANG, you’re hit with, “The Pool Scene”, or a man begging you to put his family out of their misery. It’s a perfect balance, and one that keeps you guessing about what you'll encounter next.  Play this game.",

I got to chapter 2 in 30 mins or so and there were like 2-3 different people on during the middle of the day. It's the middle of the night right now as I type this and I can't find anybody for the campaign. Yeah the graphics are a little bit better, there's still plenty of bugs that the devs will never work out because they just push out games considering they released a few games this year according to steam's realease dates. For example: one of the bugs I came across is Jessica Nelson got in the car as soon as I went to back out when she's supposed to wait there for you to talk to her husband then get in. It's not like it matters, but it just shows the effort put in, the mouse in the title screen and when you pause the game is choppy. The game runs fine though. Expect it to lag if you don't meet to excel the requirements they listed for a pc.  Again, I was hoping for player interaction and there weren't many. Of course the farther in the campaign the more players you'll come across since it only searches for people at your chapter and lower. So if you get this expect single player for the most part. They don't give you the live player count for a reason in the Community Hub.",

            "review_text": "I am honestly stumped on how to review this properly. I will admit as said above me, that yes the graphics really have not changed much, and the audio could use improvement. But overall it is still very playable and fun at the same time. I dont understand why the felt the need to try and improve an almost perfect game in the first place.  Since the original release in 2011 i can honestly say the graphics have not improved much at all if any. The audio can be out of tune sometimes, 'you might be driving a car then the engine sound wil cut out and kick back in randomly' 'the charecters lips move, but the audio does not match'. Sought of like a cheap chinese film.  But this still did not deter me from purchising and playing the 'Definitive' edition. The main issue i am having which just gets on my nerves the slightest is the control mechanics. Yes they have and can be clunky. I find it happens most in doorways, Jumping over obstacles on the Island. There have been a couple of occasions, where i have attempted to flee from an encounter, only to find that i have ran into a corner/deck and can not scale the porch guidewires. In a way forcing me to either (A) fight, or (B) try to ran around the walker.  In a nutshell my recommendation comes down to this, Were you origanlly a huge fan of the 'Dead Island' series either on console or a prevous version. If yes then believe me you will still enjoy this version, neally as much as the first time you played this title.  However if you are only going to buy this title because you think you want to try one of your old school favourite titles, with the latest graphics and gameplay phyics. Then i would strongly recomend you do not purchase this title. Because If your a not in love with the game, with it's corny gameplay, and humerous story line. then i can gaurentee that you will not be satisfied, the glitched/bugs will be unforgiving, you will feel the slight clunky-ness of the controls and you will place the control down and not re load the title at all. Causing you too have wasted your money.   So guys i will be giving this a postive because i loved the game from release date, and my love for the title can overcome the glithces or clunky controls.",

            "review_text": "The zombie paradise has been revamped to meet the standards of current gen graphics in Dead Island: Definitive edition. The original devs 'Techland' once again return to the Dead Island series, porting gaming assets and implementing new textures/effects under their latest 'Chrome Engine 6' in which their succesful 2nd open world zombie rpg 'Dying Light' runs on.  What's New ? The main highlight in the definitive edition is the brand new updated graphics of course. The oddly clayish, gritty, blurry, and faded atmosphere that was once in the original Dead Island is now crisp,more detailed, and vibrant which suits the tropical theme. Even models such as npcs got a geometry/texture boost which gives them more detail and artistic personality whether they're living or infected. Not to mention, various new effects such as the lightining technology used in Dying Light has been implemented. The new lighting system vastly improves the over-all look of the world. On a side note it seems that techland added some new tweaks to their lighting technology as it includes hazy rays that can also be visible through indoor areas or just in general everywhere sort of like the early versions of Dying Light in which the retail version lacks. However, despite the new graphical changes the gameplay is pretty much the same and some new minor technical bugs exist such as chrome blood,or weird physics that makes zombie ragdolls fall even faster or the fact that you can't kick a beach ball. This is expected as the game itself is being ported to a brand new engine. On the bright side, the game seems to run smoother than the original and it seems that the major bugs had been tweaked that once plagued the original.  PROS - Great updated/enhanced graphics - Fun gameplay - all dlc's included - smooth gameplay experience  CONS - some new technical bugs   Verdict Dead Island: definitve edition is a true remastered game unlike other games such as 'Sleeping dogs' or 'HD remakes' for example. Like it's original, it is fun and thrilling especially with online players. The graphics are way better than the original which makes it 10x pleasing to venture around the zombie infested island. This is a 'remaster' not a 'Reboot' so don't expect new gameplay elements. I recommend this for those who are fans of Dead Island or those wanting more dead island content while waiting on the devs 'Sumo Digital' to reveal new information on the upcoming sequel 'Dead Island 2'; also if you never played Dead Island or Dying Light then give the definitve edtion a try. Plus the price discount is generously low for all content included.",

            "review_text": "I paid just under £7 British Pounds for the Definitive Collection and I have to say, having spent a few hours in Dead Island DE, the first of the two full games included, it's the best purchase I've made so far this year.  Techland understand a thing or two about never taking advantage of their customers and they've come up trumps again. This is not just any old 'remaster' - this is a complete port of both Dead Island and Dead Island Riptide into the latest Dying Light game engine - and boy does it show. Three hours into Dead Island DE and I'm constantly blown away by the gorgeous visuals. Now I understand what Techland envisaged for Dead Island the first time around - but only now can their game tech truly do their vision justice.  It's hard to over-emphasise just how impressive these games now look in their new forms. I understand some people have reported issues but I have to be honest and say that even on my six year-old PC (running a lowly GTX 760 on an i7@2.80GHz with 12GB RAM) I'm able to max everything out (no compromises) and the game has, so far, been rock-solid for me. I can also report that Techland have done a solid job with the PS4 version of DI:DE, as I'm fortunate enough to own that, too. Both versions look spectacular and run without complaint.  The actual gameplay remains as hokey and yet strangely enjoyable as ever. It's Dead Island, after all, and although it may wow with it's swish new game engine and stunning lighting and vistas (and the views really are lovely), the gameplay is largely unchanged from tne originals. Menus look better organised and work perfectly well with the 360 controller on PC (my preferred way of playing). In short: if you enjoyed the gameplay of the originals you'll get exactly the same thing here, but it will all look several magnitudes better than those original versions ever did.  Well done to Techland for doing this right. They weren't lazy; this is not a cash-in and the developer should be congratulated for its efforts and for its sensible pricing.  Highly Recommended. Really, this sets a new benchmark for re-releasing games - more publishers should take note.",
