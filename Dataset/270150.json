At its best RWR is fast paced, engaging, and fun skill based tactical gameplay.  There are some problems with RWR, namely the graphics don't always adequately reflect the respective heights of different pieces of cover, sometimes making it difficult to know whether or not you can be shot. This is even more troublesome when using rockets or grenades, as an object you believe you can fire over (or the ground) will sometimes stop and explosive meant for the enemy resulting in your death and the teamkills of any number of your squad mates.  The modding scene for this game is starting to spin up and means there are even more exciting options for gameplay around the corner for Running With Rifles. Get a 4-pack and play with your friends and their squads for even more tactical and strategic action!",

            "review_text": "RUNNING WITH RIFLES  In one sentence it is a beautifully crafted minimalistic Top-Down Tactical shooter.  The closest similar games are Cannon Fodder and Warhammer 40K: Dawn of War, with the difference that you are controlling just one unit. I am recommending this game because I feel that it does an amazing job capturing 'war'. WIth this game I've experienced war at it's fullest.   Weapons here have a kill chance rather than taking off hp. It is possible to survive a full-auto M16 blast to the face, and then kill opponent with one shot. Such is war.  I started as a Private, with a firefight lifespan of 15 to 30 seconds. In my first death ever, I was run over by our own tank because I didn't get out of it's way fast enough. By now the game says I've played ~67 hours, and died 1086 times total, which means I die on average every 3.7 minutes. What do these 3.7 minutes consist of?   Running to the combat zone and getting shot right away.  Running to the combat zone with your squad, getting pinned by sniper fire, leaving your squad to flank the enemy from the right and throwing him a fragmentation grenade.  Running to the combat zone with your squad and straight into an enemy APC, which proceeds to mow you down in a matter of seconds  Running to the combat zone, hearing APC from the distance and dual rocketing it into oblivion, before it even does anything.  Getting thrown out of your own boat and knifed by enemy commandos.  Throwing out an enemy driver and hijacking an enemy tank.  Sneaking into enemy base, hiding behind trees from big patrols and killing small patrols with silenced MP5, then destroying radar jammer, and finally calling airstrike on everyone inside.  Having an airstrike called on you, and be the only survivor from your squad, as everything around you goes up in fireworks.  Doing drive-by in a jeep, going ~100 kp/h as your squaddies obliterate everyone on the sides, while you run over slow ones.  Running over to assist a wounded soldier, as enemy tank rolls into view and obliterates both of you.  Shielding machinegunner with riot shield while he reloads, holding back the advancing enemy until support arrives.  Blocking off passages for enemy vehicles with sandbags and car wrecks.  Mining the road and exploding charges with enemy tank right above them. Most satisfactory.  Lying wounded, watching your positions get overrun with enemy hordes, and then calling an airstrike on yourself and them. Because you were dead anyway.  The list goes on forever.  UPDATE: 90% of the negative reviews on this game are written by people who have not bothered to even learn to play the game.  Experience grind. One of the biggest problems people currently identify is the that you need to level up in order to level up faster.  - Well, here is the easiest way to level up without having to 'git good' - use shield. When you are wearing shield, you soak up 1 exp for every kill made by friendlies close to you. That means, if you are shielding a general, who calls heavy artillery strike on 30 people - you just got 30 exp in 30 seconds, doing nothing. - Second easiest way is to heal people. you get ~16 exp per heal. - A little harder, but the most profitable and best way to level up is to be in the capture zone when an area is captured. You get lots of RP and ~50 or something exp.  'Servers are empty' claims. Most of the players of this game are in North America. Fortunately or unfortunately for you.",

            "review_text": "Running with Rifles, a top-down tactical shooter that got recently released out of Steam’s Early Access, ready to be played and reviewed in its supposed polished state. At first glance it may look like any other top-down shooter with endless swarms of enemies, but after experiencing a few deaths, you quickly realize that this game requires tactics and teamwork. Once your player dies, you will re-spawn as another grunt on the battlefield with tons of AI units fighting around you, and an itchy beard.  My first impressions when opening the game was that it felt reminiscent of an old console / PC classic, Army Men, but it quickly became a game where I was forced to find cover and provide suppression for the rest of my squad to advance. Instead of specific objective points, you must maintain control of certain areas of the map by fighting your way to it and defending it, which makes for an excellent gameplay dynamic that encourages you to focus on holding certain areas. Without making use of tactics, it is very easy to fall into a stalemate with both sides making no advancement whatsoever.  The AI in Running with Rifles is impressive to say the least, which pushes you to make use of tactics such as retreating when overpowered, taking cover whenever possible, and if you’re not careful, the enemy AI will create a fierce counter-attack.  During your time playing, you can expect to use a wide range of weapons and equipment from the game’s Armory System, and drivable vehicles such as jeeps, Tanks &amp; APCs. Most of these items are unlocked while leveling up in the game’s ranking system.  Multiplayer wise there are a number of servers with upwards of 64 Players. The only issues I’ve had so far with the game is when playing in a match where all teams are in a stalemate, it can get a bit tiring. Perhaps this could be remedied either with a time counter, or some sort of more in-depth Morale system for the AI. The other issue with the game is the hit detection being a bit off on a few occasion.  Overall, if you are a fan of top-down shooters with a nice tactical approach, this game is worth checking out, one that has a responsive controls, smooth and great looking cartoon-y graphics, and a game that will give you that quick war fix you need from time to time. Running with Rifles also supports modding, which adds more justification of its price tag of $14.99 which provides a massive backlog of content to go through, hence longevit",

Alpha team on the Western gate, sets up a perimeter with sandbags. They're on a stalemate, been continuously fighting for the last few hours.  On the eastern wall, Bravo team is making an advance towards the enemy radio tower. We got our C4s packed, breached the wall and managed to destroy the tower.  Outside the wall, a General calls in 8 rounds of atrillery barrage. Target: the stronghold. The initial explosion from the C4 alerted the enemy troops to the location. Bravo team is pinned away from the escape route. We scrambled for cover. The artillery came showering like the torrential downpour in the amazon rainforrest.   As the shockwaves of the explosions subsided, the smoke settling, my troops and the rest of Bravo team's limbs and organs lay wasted on the dessert sands along with the enemy's tattered bodies.",

            "review_text": "This game has succeeded where many shooters/war games have failed. It has the feel of an actual front line fight where cover, high ground, suppressive fire and reinforcements all play a huge role. Starting as a Private you will not have access to any special weapons or even a radio to call in fire missions or reinforcements, but with skill and experience you can still have a big influence on the battle. Level up a bit and you can have a major impact on the battle. It is very rewarding to be able to break an hour long stalemate by attacking in force from an unexpected direction, calling in waves of paratrooper reinforcements at a critical time to hold recently captured territory, calling in massive bombardments on huge troop formations, throwing the driver out of a tank that has been dominating the field and knifing him, destroying a communication tower behind enemy lines that prevents AI counterattacks and allows your front line to finally move forward etc.  In the beginning it can feel like all you do is die, but if the battle has turned into a stalemate, that just means it's time to put your commander hat on and try something different. Sometimes sneaking to the back of the base and placing a single sandbag can make all the difference. Now you've drawn attention away from the front. Every person that comes to attack you is one less reinforcement headed to the well defended front line. The enemy front line weakens, then breaks as your guys come swarming in to mop up: game over and a very satisfying victory.",

            "review_text": "The air is full of danger as snipers are positioned on the buildings, and soldiers guarding the base. Your commander gives you a signal, a command to move out and take the next base. You move out, your squadmates surrounding you, a feeling of dread growing. Suddenly, the man beside you collapses, and you hear the terrifying sound of a sniper. You dive for cover, and in the brush around you, more soldiers poke their rifles, preparing to fire. It's over. Your squad is dead, and you're surrounded. Bullets strike the boulders you're taking cover behind, the sound of gunfire everywhere. Deciding to take a risk, you poke your head out, preparing to fire.  Boom, dead. Rinse and repeat. Over and over.  ---------------------------------------------------------------  Running with Rifles is a ♥♥♥♥ing blast. It's slow paced and tactical, requiring quick reflexes and thinking. You can choose how to do things - Do you want to command 20 soldiers to charge a base, or do you want to sneak around with a silenced pistol and take out some high-valued commanders? Do you snipe encoming soldiers, or blow up radio towers to disrupt communications?   There are lots of things to do, and the battles are intense. It's also a very long game, battles often lasting up to an hour, sometimes more. Despite the drawn-out battles, it doesn't really start to feel boring - You always have a goal to work towards, and if you find fighting on the front lines growing boring, you can grab a silenced pistol and sneak behind lines to take out valuable targets and blow stuff up, only to come back and find your assistance has allowed your men to push forward and take the zone.   The game also has a very robust multiplayer system. Holy crap, multiplayer is fun. There's co-op, competitive, etc. This game is jam-packed with replayability. I'd strongly reccomend it to anyone.",

            "review_text": "Don't buy this game if you're playing solo.   Most of these guys play multiplayer - I'm strictly a solo player and for me it wasn't worth it.  Until you're a fairly high rank, you can't accomplish anything as a single soldier, and that's a problem because you're the only one on your side that does anything. Friendly AI will hop into a tank, crash it repeatedly into the side of a house, run 3 friendlies over, and then abandon the tank in enemy territory. This means a LOT, because vehicles are overpowered. Once you can control a tank or APC, you can almost roll up a whole map by yourself if you have infantry support. Likewise, when an enemy tank or APC shows up, they mow down every friendly in sight and undo all your hard work. YOUR hard work, because if an enemy checkpoint has been taken over it is almost certain that you are the one who did it.  Even if I set up an objective I captured by myself so that the friendly AI can defend it, they still screw it up. One time I had machine-gun emplacements set up so that the AI could hold off the enemy. The friendly AI used them - as cover. They hid behind the machine guns, which were pointed in the right direction, and shot over them using rifles.  The Friendly commander, who sets objectives for the AI, picks the worst possible places to attack where you're forced to fight two opposing armies at the same time. This is meaningful, because all of the friendly troops that aren't directly under your control run off to where the Friendly AI commander sends them, leaving you with no support at all.  The enemy spawning is too frequent and too close to the action. As people have mentioned before, you can sit on top of a house with a sniper rifle and take out 150 enemy soldiers by yourself with a K/D ratio of 20, and it won't make a lick of difference because your allies can't or won't take ground, and killing all those men doesn't buy you enough time to take an objective yourself. And taking objectives is the only thing that matters in RwR.  It is a good looking game. The individual skirmishes, when you're not worrying about winning a level and just shooting it out with the enemy, are fun. I sank quite a few hours into it (don't look at my time on here - it's not accurate).   But ultimately I binned the game because it just doesn't go anywhere. It's a pointless grind.",

Cons: - Multiplayer is almost dead and nobody seems to play PVP. - £10.99 feels like a bit much. - Gets boring quite quickly. - The height of the object you're taking cover behind is unclear so you end up shoot walls alot.

Was very pleased to see it's seen continued development and a Steam release.  The game's a fairly casual, top down shooter, with relatively hardcore mechanics. Think of it as Arma Lite. Bullets are deadly, explosive and vehicles are deadlier. Tactics and coordination are a must in order to advance. Squad mechanics work well, and the AI is competent and deadly, indeed. There's a wide variety of weapons and vehicles to utilise, including rifles, LMGs, shotguns, explosives and APCs, as well as a handfull of fun gamemodes, as well as mod support.  I hope the multiplayer community grows further, as I feel this game could really shine as a nice pick-up and play squad based shooter.  Graphics and sound are good, whilst 'basic'. The style is reminiscent of good old green army men toys. Particle effects like explosions and muzzle flair are nice, and punch up the 'toy' style.  Overall if you want a fun top-down to jump into every once in a while, but still enjoy some of the depth you'd get from it's bigger cousins, this game is a must.",

            "review_text": "I can't recommend RWR enough. So far, I've been plaing about 10 hours, singleplayer only. Think of it as Battlefield 2 from above. You start out as simple soldier of your chosen army (there are 3 factions, roughly representing USA, Russia and EU; with different weapons). You are on a large map (some of them are well known from the Battlefield series), the main objective is - like in Battlefield - capturing one area after another, until you control the whole map. The great thing is that your comrades (and there's plenty of them) will fight, regardless of what you do. You can take a jeep and drive around the map, you can go full Commando and try to capture an area in the enemy hinterland or you can go for a secondary objective that will randomly pop up (capture and bring back an enemy cargo truck, free prisoners, destroy an enemy radio tower and others).  With each kill you gain XP, which allow you to slowly level up and increase in rank. Every 1.000 XP one further soldier is assigned to you, so that you can form a powerful squad (you can, however, always decrease your squad size, down to the point that you're fighting alone - helpful for stealth missions). Also with increased rank you're able do buy and equip different weapons and equipment. You can pick up enemy weapons (bosses will drop rare weapons; these are not overpowered, you'll always be fine with your standard equipment). You can call in reinforcements, mortar and artillery strikes, vehicles and more to turn the tide of a battle.  When you die, which happens a lot, you respawn at a spawnpoint (open your map before respawning to selectanother one). You keep your money, rank and XP, but if you had a rare weapon or other precious loot, you'll have to hurry to your corpse and retrieve it. Combat is challenging - if you don't wear a vest, you'll be dead after one or two hits. Line of sight plays an important role, the terrain isn't flat. If you just try to rush into the enemy, you'll die; you have to make use of crouching and laying prone, cover, stealth and tactical squad manouvers in order to overcome an equal or superior enemy.  I haven't played multiplayer yet, but the SP alone would have been worth the price. I'll update the review when I'm further in the game.",

I think that the co-op multiplayer experience is the high point of this title, and the pvp is fun - good luck finding a server with anyone playing, though. Co-op servers are always populated, in my experience.  You'll level up, earn a larger squad to control, unlock better weapons and body armor, etc, as you kill more and more enemies.   The depth of this game sort of reveals itself the longer you play and the more skilled you become - and the more skilled players you play with - setting up cover deployments, weapon deployments (more on this further on....) moving the frontline up with other players, calling airstrikes, reenforcements, relocating armory/communication/respawn trucks... it's all really good, co-op fun. The gunplay and sounds are very satisfying, and each weapon has its pros and cons. There is no super weapon... maybe the P90. My favourite assault rifle is the Famas.  This game has a ton of potential, and I realize it's a small time, independent affair, but there are a few negatives. (I'm aware that this game is being patched, but still, I review this as it stands today.)  Cover deployment and weapon deployment (stationary MGs, miniguns, TOW launchers) seem to deploy in a random orientation and with minds of their own. There is no option to rotate cover or deployable weapons, they are placed down in the orientation that you are handed. If the MG you spent your hard earned resource points on is facing the opposite direction that you'd like - well, tough ♥♥♥♥. It's frustrating. Sometimes you will deploy a cover item and it will inexplicably roll onto you and kill you. Or deploy in a manner completely opposite the preview. Sometimes it won't show up at all. Sometimes it will take ten times longer to deploy than it should and that ends up getting you killed. You will get good at timing the enemies approach vs placing a cover block. If you do get good at this, you can easily hide behind your sandbags and take out 30 enemy soldiers without breaking a sweat. Out of cover, you'll be dead in one or two shots.  Does it seem like I am talking about cover too much? Maybe so, but it's the most important life extending aspect of the game, right after body armor. And maybe riding in a tank.  Anyways, it's not without its flaws as a game, the graphics are basic and leave a lot to be desired, but overall, I have enjoyed this title FAR more than many other higher priced games that I've played this year. It's incredibly addictive and incredibly fun.  Get ready to rage quit as you try ten times to respawn and collect your rare blue weapons and items that you lost upon death only to die over and over in a suicidal attempt to save dat lewt.

I would recommend playing through a quickie on easy to get a feel for the game, and then starting a campaign and tweaking the difficulty until it's an even match between the ai teams. This forces you to play smart and your playing really impacts the game.   Unfortunatley, it kinda stops being so fun after about 2 campaign playthroughs, because nothing (xp and rp) carries over between games and once you get past 10,000 xp there's no incentive to level up really, because you unlock everything (I made it past 50,000 in a single campaign, so there's a lot of room for upgrades). After a while you just get bored and end up cheating yourself some rp and carpet bombing the map. Also a lot of the maps have quite a bit of blank space that really should be filled.  8/10, fantastic game but the replay value diminishes quickly. New campaigns and more unlocks past 10,000 xp would go a long way to improve the game, but it's still super fun as is.",

            "review_text": "Did you love playing wargames with little plastic soldiers when you were a kid? Perhaps you still do? Who am I to judge? Either way, this game is definitely for you!  RWR really captures the joy and playfulness of that familiar experience of messing around with little green toy soldiers. If you're considering purchasing this game and are currently thinking 'hmm, this looks like it's my kinda thing', rest assured it is because I went through the exact same thought process, bit the bullet and love it.  Speaking of biting the bullet... this game can be quite brutal! Every hit has a 50/50 chance to kill you unless you're wearing armour, which only mitigates a few more hits, so be prepared to die regularly! It's no biggie.  I've only played single player and can't understand why some reviews below say it's only good multiplayer; I can see how it'd be even better with a bunch of friends, but honestly single player is also immersive, fun and challenging. Sure, it takes some time to get used to how everything works, but that's part of the charm for me. Once you grasp the basics, the game's depth unfolds quite organically as you level up and unlock new options, begin to control a squad etc.  I think the AI is really good, they use some pretty sneaky tactics and coordinate their attacks really nicely. You are never left with that feeling of the AI 'cheating', for example it's actually possible to sneak up behind some enemies and spray them with bullets before they magically notice you! I've seen much worse AI in some AAA games, so this is impressive to me.  The game has a really nice, gentle humour that often raises a smile.  Another thing I love about it is how balanced the weapons are. I often find myself going back to the humble assault rifle that is your default firearm even once I have access to higher level stuff, because it still has its place and your weapon choice is more about how you choose to play than one weapon being inherently better.  I very rarely buy Steam games at full price as there are so many sales, but with a game like this I urge you to pay what the devs ask, as I did, so that this awesome team will continue to improve this game and also hopefully make more such games in future! The price is very reasonable anyway.  Please keep up the good work, this is my new favourite game!",

You could say it is a mix of a top-down Arma together with Soldat, which reminds me of RWR for some reason. Running with Rifles offers a wide variety of guns for you to utilize and learn to master. The kill system is based on 'Chance', percentage of each weapon which has it's own value that determines the probability of killing the enemy that got hit by a bullet. The combat system makes the game harder than just to move your mouse and click on someone's head as it is more chance based rather than just shooting and getting E-Z kills. Easy to learn, Hard to master. servers used to be low populated but as of now the game got a huge increase in players. My suggestion? Buy it. Don't hesitate.

They never miss a shot and i mean never miss a shot, you could set their accuracy to as low as possible and they still never miss, as soon as you turn a corner you get insta-killed by some guy at the back of the map with a pistol. It also takes around 30 thousand shots to kill one of them, you can hit them with a rocket and they'll get right back up. They act like they were trained by General Patton. They use tactics, they flank, meanwhile your guys run right at them. the only way to beat the AI (and the game) is to get the radio and just call in a never ending barrage of artillery on them.

            "review_text": "Be seated.  Men, all this stuff you hear about America not wanting to fight, wanting to stay out of the war, is a lot of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Americans love to fight. All real Americans love the sting and clash of battle. When you were kids, you all admired the champion marble shooter, the fastest runner, the big-league ball players and the toughest boxers. Americans love a winner and will not tolerate a loser. Americans play to win all the time. That's why Americans have never lost and will never lose a war. The very thought of losing is hateful to Americans. Battle is the most significant competition in which a man can indulge. It brings out all that is best and it removes all that is base.  You are not all going to die. Only two percent of you right here today would be killed in a major battle. Every man is scared in his first action. If he says he's not, he's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ liar. But the real hero is the man who fights even though he's scared. Some men will get over their fright in a minute under fire, some take an hour, and for some it takes days. But the real man never lets his fear of death overpower his honor, his sense of duty to his country, and his innate manhood.  All through your army career you men have ♥♥♥♥♥ed about what you call 'this chicken-♥♥♥♥ drilling.' That is all for a purpose—to ensure instant obedience to orders and to create constant alertness. This must be bred into every soldier. I don't give a ♥♥♥♥ for a man who is not always on his toes. But the drilling has made veterans of all you men. You are ready! A man has to be alert all the time if he expects to keep on breathing. If not, some German son-of-a-♥♥♥♥♥ will sneak up behind him and beat him to death with a sock full of ♥♥♥♥. There are four hundred neatly marked graves in Sicily, all because one man went to sleep on the job—but they are German graves, because we caught the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ asleep before his officer did.  An army is a team. It lives, eats, sleeps, and fights as a team. This individual hero stuff is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. The bilious ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who write that stuff for the Saturday Evening Post don't know any more about real battle than they do about ♥♥♥♥ing. And we have the best team—we have the finest food and equipment, the best spirit and the best men in the world. Why, by God, I actually pity these poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s we're going up against.  All the real heroes are not storybook combat fighters. Every single man in the army plays a vital role. So don't ever let up. Don't ever think that your job is unimportant. What if every truck driver decided that he didn't like the whine of the shells and turned yellow and jumped headlong into a ditch? That cowardly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ could say to himself, 'Hell, they won't miss me, just one man in thousands.' What if every man said that? Where in the hell would we be then? No, thank God, Americans don't say that. Every man does his job. Every man is important. The ordnance men are needed to supply the guns, the quartermaster is needed to bring up the food and clothes for us because where we are going there isn't a hell of a lot to steal. Every last damn man in the mess hall, even the one who boils the water to keep us from getting the GI ♥♥♥♥♥, has a job to do.  Each man must think not only of himself, but think of his buddy fighting alongside him. We don't want yellow cowards in the army. They should be killed off like flies. If not, they will go back home after the war, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cowards, and breed more cowards. The brave men will breed more brave men. Kill off the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cowards and we'll have a nation of brave men.  One of the bravest men I saw in the African campaign was on a telegraph pole in the midst of furious fire while we were moving toward Tunis. I stopped and asked him what the hell he was doing up there. He answered, 'Fixing the wire, sir.' 'Isn't it a little unhealthy up there right now?' I asked. 'Yes sir, but this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ wire has got to be fixed.' I asked, 'Don't those planes strafing the road bother you?' And he answered, 'No sir, but you sure as hell do.' Now, there was a real soldier. A real man. A man who devoted all he had to his duty, no matter how great the odds, no matter how seemingly insignificant his duty appeared at the time.  And you should have seen the trucks on the road to Gabès. Those drivers were magnificent. All day and all night they crawled along those son-of-a-♥♥♥♥♥ roads, never stopping, never deviating from their course with shells bursting all around them. Many of the men drove over 40 consecutive hours. We got through on good old American guts. These were not combat men. But they were soldiers with a job to do. They were part of a team. Without them the fight would have been lost.  Sure, we all want to go home. We want to get this war over with. But you can't win a war lying down. The quickest way to get it over with is to get the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who started it. We want to get the hell over there and clean the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing up, and then get at those purple-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Japs. The quicker they are whipped, the quicker we go home. The shortest way home is through Berlin and Tokyo. So keep moving. And when we get to Berlin, I am personally going to shoot that paper-hanging son-of-a-♥♥♥♥♥ Hitler.  When a man is lying in a shell hole, if he just stays there all day, a Boche will get him eventually. The hell with that. My men don't dig foxholes. Foxholes only slow up an offensive. Keep moving. We'll win this war, but we'll win it only by fighting and showing the Germans that we've got more guts than they have or ever will have. We're not just going to shoot the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, we're going to rip out their living ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed guts and use them to grease the treads of our tanks. We're going to murder those lousy Hun ♥♥♥♥♥uckers by the bushel-♥♥♥♥ing-basket.  Some of you men are wondering whether or not you'll chicken out under fire. Don't worry about it. I can assure you that you'll all do your duty. War is a bloody business, a killing business. The Nazis are the enemy. Wade into them, spill their blood or they will spill yours. Shoot them in the guts. Rip open their belly. When shells are hitting all around you and you wipe the dirt from your face and you realize that it's not dirt, it's the blood and gut of what was once your best friend, you'll know what to do.  I don't want any messages saying 'I'm holding my position.' We're not holding a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed thing. We're advancing constantly and we're not interested in holding anything except the enemy's balls. We're going to hold him by his balls and we're going to kick him in the ♥♥♥; twist his balls and kick the living ♥♥♥♥ out of him all the time. Our plan of operation is to advance and keep on advancing. We're going to go through the enemy like ♥♥♥♥ through a tinhorn.  There will be some complaints that we're pushing our people too hard. I don't give a damn about such complaints. I believe that an ounce of sweat will save a gallon of blood. The harder we push, the more Germans we kill. The more Germans we kill, the fewer of our men will be killed. Pushing harder means fewer casualties. I want you all to remember that. My men don't surrender. I don't want to hear of any soldier under my command being captured unless he is hit. Even if you are hit, you can still fight. That's not just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t either. I want men like the lieutenant in Libya who, with a Luger against his chest, swept aside the gun with his hand, jerked his helmet off with the other and busted the hell out of the Boche with the helmet. Then he picked up the gun and he killed another German. All this time the man had a bullet through his lung. That's a man for you!  8.5/10",

Running with rifles is a game that seems very interesting and seems to cater to your love for the old DOS game named Cannon Fodder. It doesn't play exactly like Cannon Fodder did, seeing as you do not have a squad trailing you that you have as lives. You are basically controlling a single infantry man fighting others, and you keep respawning when you die. That is fair enough, however the core of the game is flawed, in Cannon Fodder there was always a sense of progress, but in this game that is missing.  What do I mean? For an example you get the feeling that you can unlock weapons by bringing them back to the armory, but that is just temporary and gives you only 4 hours, before the gun poofs and you have to redo the process. It wouldn't be that bad if this was the only mechanic, but this game has more crap in store for you... Imagine fighting battles where enemies can SPAWN ANYWHERE around you while you are focusing off your character? Because in this game, you have to constantly be looking at the enemy because you get no feedback from the game if your bullets are making contact, so you are spotting for bullet impacts and blood. And while you are doing this, and trying to get that line of sight to make sure the bullet can get there, a guy can SPAWN and move in on you from your rear, left or right flank and kill you.  Enemies will also keep spawning in areas where you are fighting, making you feel like you aren't making any progress except killing tons of soldiers. And then there is the 'AI Commander' that decides which sectors you are to attack, if there are two opposing factors, he will keep cycling you between attacking faction A and B, essentially you are capturing territory A, and losing B. You then move to attack B and lose A and this cycle keeps repeating, forcing you to fight over the same territory for HOURS.  The developers take away all sense of progress with this game, and it will quickly frustrate you as a player. And when the progress disappears it becomes tiring and you eventually lose the fun factor after 1-2 hours of playing. Once the fun factor is gone, the game turns into a thumbs down experience... So as a Coop game? Stay away from it, as tempting as it may seem, it needs a massive overhaul and should still be Very Early Access.",

And once you finally reach the last one on some maps, good luck. You can't use commander support so again you just sit there forever in the same area. Not very entertaining. I like the game but it needs a lot of tweaking and reworking to be something I'd recommend to anyone. It's just not very fun and feels like work trying to win on some maps or even simply do co-op.",

I had such a crappy computer at the time I couldnt run it, but just installed it again today and there were 0 servers up. Also, I was expecting the game to be more serious than it was, the music is rather comic, not a deal breaker though. I don't doubt the singleplayer in this game is fun for those interested, but I can't recommend the game to anyone who, like me, is looking for a fun online experience since there aren't any servers.   EDIT:  @Producer-san mentioned that when he played the day after I wrote this review there were 10 servers up and three of them were full. He also says it was even more packed the day I wrote this review, which I find odd because I didn't see any. The server list was empty and the refresh button greyed out. Maybe it was a bug/internet problem, trying not to be unfair here. Also, you should know it was Christmas day when I tried to play the game most recently, so perhaps there were no servers because of that, just a thought. Since this is still my review however, I have to say I still wouldn't recommend the game to my friends.",

            "review_text": "The problem with RWR is essentially misleading advertising. The game supposedly touts replayability by way of being a sandbox and declares it has RPG elements.  *RPG Elements* Not really. While you gain experience to unlock radio calls for reinforcements and basic guns/gear, you have no choice or customization options (you can't even name your soldier). Each time you want to swap out guns/gear you need to go to an armory and do it manually, which gets irritating as you'll generally have either a long trip to the front or can, with bad luck, die a few seconds after customizing your loadout.  *Sandbox* Again, not really. If your definition of sandbox is 'you aren't penalized for failing to do what the game prompts you to do' then I suppose it qualifies, but for me sandbox generally means freedom to do what I want, when I want, where I want in a fashion that can be meaningful, enjoyable, or fulfilling. While it's certainly possible to swap in a silenced submachine gun and try to 'sneak' behind enemy lines, there's really no stealth feature, nor is there anything to do behind enemy lines that has any real value. Additionally, it's entirely possible for your NPC allies to win each map area, turning it into a safezone devoid of anything to do or any enemies to fight. In one game I wound up advancing through two maps without actively attempting to do so. The computer forced me to move towards completing the game.  *Replayability* Unless you're big into multiplayer, nope, not really. It gets pretty routine after about five hours because all there really is to do is collect a squad and run up to the front and shoot enemies until you die. Rinse, repeat. Finish up a campaign? Awesome! Now it's over and the next time you want to play you have to start from scratch.  If you're looking for an open world sandbox military shooter with RPG elements... this is not it. If you want something to screw around on for a few hours, you might like it. But for me this was definitely not what I thought I was buying.",

            "review_text": "RUNNING WITH RIFLES, otherwise known as RWR (and therefore shall be called such during this review) is a semi-RTS fast-paced action combat game with multiplayer. I was initially intrigued about this game because it looked like it could be a spirtual successor to the Amiga game called Cannon Fodder. If you are not familiar with it, it was also a semi-RTS fast-paced combat action game.  Well, aside from the fact you are given command of soldiers during the act of war, the two games have nothing in common. I had hoped to find a game similar to Cannon Fodder with multiplayer, and RWR isn't that, but it isn't why I am giving this game a No recommendation.  There are three factions. They are the Greenbelts (US Army), Brownpants (Soviet Red Army) and Graycollars (German Wehrmacht).  The essense of my problems with this game are minor, but once you add them all up, it really knocks me out of the zone of enjoyment. I want to point out that I only played the co-op campaign map with a friend. We did not try versus mode, which I have no interest in.  To summarize:  * Little sense of progress.  * Some of the early campaign levels are a lot of fun, but later ones are huge slogs.  * Terrible final campaign levels which completely invert the style of gameplay you are taught during the majority of the game. (Why do so many developers succumb to this temptation?)  * Simplistic UI.  * Terrible 3rd person aiming cursor.  That's the LT;DR version of my review. Let me address each of the items in detail.   *** Little sense of progress ***  You have a character level, which the game expresses as an army rank which goes up as you gain XP. You gain XP by killing enemies and capturing territories. This level is used to unlock more weapons and more squad mates that you can recruit to fight for you, and when you die you lose XP.  The issue with this is that you unlock all of the weapons available to your faction fairly early. After that, as far as I can tell, levels and XP become meaningless.  Initially you do not have access to the other faction's weapons, but you can collect and sell enemy weapons in order to 'unlock' them.  Unfortunately, this means that you only have access to it for 4 real-life hours. After that, the weapon is removed from your Armory. To regain it, you have to capture more.  This is frustrating. You lose all sense of progress in the campaign when weapons start to disappear. I had great fun hunting down the enemies and stealing their weaponry, but later the game decides to force me to do that all over again. I eventually stopped caring about having the biggest arsenal of weaponry and only bothered unlocking two useful guns and ignored the rest.  I was told by a developer that I should just 'buy extra stock of a gun when available' which I feel is totally missing the point of progression. When money is easy to gather in this game, and I have unlimited stockpiling ability -- Why not just give me the weapon forever in the campaign, instead of forcing me to unlock it again every 4 hours?  You can find special weapons in the game, which only last for as long as you can stay alive. They drop when you die and will disappear within 90 seconds. If you die repeatedly (due to whacky enemy spawning, which I cover below), you will lose these special weapons.  So the two progression mechanics the game gives you -- XP/rank gain and weaponry gain -- are fairly hollow and not at all satisfying.   *** War of attrition ***  The early levels in the campaign are misleading. The capture mechanic is easy. You just need a certain amount of your own soldiers near the objective in order to capture it. In the early campaigns this isn't too difficult, because there are natural choke points in order to funnel the AI soldiers.  Later maps, however, lack these points and the weakness of the game's spawning system comes into terribly light.  Parts of the map which aren't your color have a chance to spawn enemy soldiers. That's reasonable, and it isn't too much of a problem when you have plenty of friendly AI soldiers around, but later in the game it appears the friendly AI spawn rate gets throttled. Like, seriously throttled. To the point where it will just be you, alone, walking around in enemy territory.  Enemies are allowed to spawn anywhere within an occupied tile (that isn't onscreen). This means you will commonly fight your way behind enemy lines, engage a bunch of troops and then retreat the way you came -- Only to run into enemy troops that spawned when you had the camera facing the opposite direction! This is immensely frustrating and you feel like you make no progress when engaging the enemy alone.  You can gather friendly AI units and take them into enemy territory, but they are too fragile and if you all die, you will spawn near the enemy territory without back up due to the greatly throttled spawning.  To make matters worse, the AI Commander will direct your forces to conflicting regions. You will be ordered to capture region A, only to go there and capture it and be told to capture region B -- which is where you just came from! This goes back and forth, and coupled with the throttled spawning makes for a very slow war of attrition which is just no fun at all later in the game.  This leads me to...   *** Terrible final levels ***  The first mission of the final level drops you in enemy territory with no backup. You have just one spawn truck, one Armory and one stash. They are located in the far top corner of the map, and you will be re-spawning at this location a lot. Even if you use the spawn truck, you will often be forced to spawn at this point simply because the enemy will advance close enough to prevent truck spawning.  There's no AI Commander. You are given just one objective, and that is to 'destroy something something' in the enemy territory. The messages pop up and disappear so regularly, that I missed my objective. There are no map indicators on where to go. I eventually fought my way to all of the radio towers and smashed them, but the level would not proceed and at this point I just gave up.   *** Simplistic UI ***  Too many to cover here, so we're back to bullet lists.  * No indicator showing which is your currently selected weapon. In the heat of battle, it's easy to fire a rare high-damage weapon off into space by accident.  * No damage indicator, nor any indication of what killed you or where it came from. You will often get sniped offscreen by enemy soldiers which spawned behind you.  * No real reload indicator. Your ammo count is shown in the lower left hand corner of the screen, far away from the action. You can reload at any time, but the reload animation will be quietly cancelled by some of your actions (such as vaulting walls). Firing your gun when empty has a click sound, but it's too quiet in the midst of battle. Also your speed is cut when reloading, so you don't want to just keep whacking the R key.  * Lack of minimap or orientation system, which means you tend to get disoriented in levels with the same terrain.   *** Poor aiming cursor ***  The aiming cursor has a red dot which indicates you are on target, then it also has a very small gray plus symbol to show where the bullet will land. It's VERY hard to see this second cursor, and so you will miss shots a lot. Why didn't they just combine the red dot and the plus cursor?  The aiming system seems to be tied to where your player model's weapon is facing. If you quickly switch to an anti-vehicle weapon and fire it before your character has completely shouldered it, the round will just fly off up into space. (Because your character had the weapon pointed upwards when unslinging it.)   *** Conclusion ***  Maybe buy it when its on sale for a few dollars, you might get a few hours enjoyment out of it, but I recommend skipping this game. It was a disappointment.",

            "review_text": "For those of you who are looking at this game and are worried about the fact it's newly released (at the time of review), let me tell you what I've experienced.  This game lives up to the positive rating it gets, and honestly, if you decide to pick it up for some silly fun, a game with friends, or 3AM sessions, Running with Rifles is worth it.  I haven't played a whole lot myself, I do want to point that out. From when I first played the demo the first thing that overtook was the fact that A LOT of AI was fighting and going on around me. It was confusing at first to learn how to duck into cover and not to die all the time, but I'm glad to say that I enjoy buying this game.  Huge scale and a fight going on around you at all times, you get lost in the action and suddenly you lost sight of your character. It's not such a bad thing either, since the dynamics and fluid tug of war sense that you get from Battles are such an adrenaline rush. Maybe the guy next to you dropped dead? Well pop out of cover and nail the SOB who got him. Wait for reinforcements to arrive, and before you know it you've been sitting on a hill driving back seemingly the whole army for 15 minutes.  Honestly, I could've gotten other things with $12.75 (Arma 3 DLC is looking good) but even though I doubt it sometimes, I would still choose this game over anything just for the unique feel it gives.  Scale - 9/10 (Close to Battlefield style, except a lot more importance on not being a hero) Art - 7.5/10 (The art style is really cool, but it can be hard to see things sometime.) Gameplay 8.5/10 (I got lost in it pretty quickly and remember the rush Multiplayer gives you) ",

The gameplay is solid and better then most 60 dollar titles that have come out in the past few years.   My only complaint about the game is that the ranking system is not very good at all, which is unfortunate because I value being able to see how I have done each and every round. This game is also good enough to take a ranking system seriously so I would love to see them do alot of work to that. Also this game could use a better friendlist option to make it easier to join your friends and be on there team in the Pvp. However these are small complaints to a very fun and solid game, this is my first review I felt this game deserved the time taken to write this. I would give it a solid 8.5 out of 10.",

Most games have you as the hero who single handendly kills all the enemies all the while shrugging off bullets, but in this game you are an ordinary soldier who can die just as quick as your teammates and enemies if you are not careful. 1 bullet can kill you. That is what I like about this game, along with the huge battles. This game, in my opinion, is so much fun. I will describe my first quick match to you:  I created a quick game and put the amount of soldiers in the game at once at 800. Intense battles were everywhere. Death was mere seconds away. I died a lot. After using the rifle for awhile, I picked up a heavy machine gun and just started mowing down the enemies. After awhile I realized the firefight I was in was unwinnable for either side. I picked up a sniper and started sneaking behind enemy lines. I crept up on some enemies who were running towards the front lines. I climbed up on a building, then I sniped one. Then his buddies said 'Sniper nearby.' I was like 'is no one going to come get the sniper?' Then my question was answered pretty quickly when 30 plus soldiers started surrounding me. I was picking them off as they climbed the ladder, but they were starting to get up on the roof with me. I called in a 3 round artillery burst on my own position. I oblierated myself along with most of the enemies trying to kill me.  10/10 would call in an artillery strike on myself to kill 30 soldiers to become a war hero again   Thank you Devs for this awesome game :)",

Nothing like finding that perfect cover and holding off 20-30 greycollars until they get wise and flank you from the rear or they squad up and rush you with grenades and shotguns. the game play kinda like helldivers but its more open world you can follow the frontlines and get into the meat grinder or you could do sabotage and steal there vehicles and blow up there radio towers etc. give the demo a try set it on hard difficulty and prepare to die a lot but when you find that strategic spot and start mowing down squads you'll find it as fun as I do.",

In addition I would like it more if you were able to play this game with others without having to port forward. After all, plenty of games already do this through steam and it works just fine. lastly, a minor detail... tanks love to 1. target you among 50 others around you and 2. they love to do this on a moments notice and fire (i might have a personal rage against those tanks but i cant tell if its me or the game at fault anymore). All of that being said, i like the concept and the ranking up system you have going on and i am glad that you went through the effort of bringing multiplayer into it despite not using steam. Nice addition with man vs. world.",

            "review_text": "RUNNING WITH RIFLES is a top-down isometric tactical shooter with open-world RPG elements. In RWR, you join the ranks of an army as a common soldier, in one of the three factions, the greenbelts (United States), Brownpants (Russia/China), Greycollars (Germany/Fourth German Reich), among thousands of other soldiers of your faction. You start off as nothing more than a common soldier having access to nothing more than the most basic weapons, the M16, AK47, and the G36. You slowly progress through the ranks unlocking more weapons and armor as well as grenades. These will save your life multiple times and will take many people's lives doing so. You gain access to sniper rifles, rocket launchers, artillery(support), shotguns, and silenced SMGs. There is a loadout to suit every player's style, whether you like striking out as a lone wolf weilding a sniper and a PDW, or you decide to become a heavy weapons specialist carrying a machine gun as well as a rocket launcher or a dozen, or even if you want to be a common solfier sacraficing his life for the glory of their country. However, one of the few cons of this game is the seemingly impossible online connections in which it is extraordinarily difficult to connect. This game offers something for everyone, so I come to my conclusion, I HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone who happens to stumble upon this.",
