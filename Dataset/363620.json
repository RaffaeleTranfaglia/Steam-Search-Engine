You are having a tea party with a stuffed animal (Ted), who demands certain items be dropped in front of him. You just go down the list. There are like five different environments.   Pros:  +It gets laughs just like  Surgeon Simulator  did +You can actually walk quite a bit around the area now   Cons:  -Regretfully, I didn't realize until after I purchased this, that this game is not made by the same developers that did  Surgeon Simulator , which is fine except they totally rip off the game style (same font, idea, and graphical style) -There is alot to interact with, but I feel there could be more. For example, there are many items/cabinets/handles on the fringes of the rooms that  look  interactable, but are not -Only five environments, as I have heard (I have witnessed two) -Price is steep for what it is   Overall, it was fun, but I certainly won't get  anywhere near  10 hours out of this. I was on the fence about the 'no' vote - but this is fair warning so my Steam friends know what they are getting into. This does not have the content of  Goat Simulator . I suppose the cheap laughs might be worth it if it is on deep discount.",
