            "review_text": "Unfortunately I cannot recommend this VR short. It uses techniques, such as camera panning and fast cuts, that are your bread and butter in flat filmmaking, but are ineffective for VR. Apart from that, the environment is ugly and boring, nothing of interest happens, and there are no sympathetic characters; even kids might struggle to enjoy it.  Note: I exceed the minimum requirements but the performance was still bad. However, I disregarded that that for the purpose of this review.",
