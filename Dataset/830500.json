    "description": "The Blobs Fight is a silly, local multiplayer, arena party game about creatures of blob like nature. Run around as a blob attacking other players to knock pieces of them off, if you collect those pieces, you get bigger. The bigger you are, the more damage you can endure, but the slower you move.",
