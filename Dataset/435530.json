I realize now in hindsight with a bit more deeper digging, its more a matter of how this translates from the developer and its inspirations. I don't regret playing it, but if a few cons were addressed, id be much more happy to change it to positive.  Pros: The atmosphere and the pixelwork is top notch for what it goes for.   Controls are smooth, solid, and superbly responsive.  Level design is intuitive and sharp.  Sounds feel satisfying and crisp.  World Immersion is very strong in its design.  Cons: The train minigame vs lore. (The characters provide a nice background, but you are likely to miss large chunks because of having to fight with a few deliberate issues, such as constant bleeding that wont be fixed. Instead of being able to listen to the background folks, or hunger that bleeds down as well.)      Singular ending and nothing you do that changes it.    This managed to irk me as I loved the nature of the story being told, but warning on looking. Fair warning.  Only two downvotes on what is an enjoyable experience, but I hope you find the time to play it sometime later if price drops, its worth the time spent at a lower price, despite the two flaws.",

While I have no complaints regarding these elements, the way the game plays is just awful. It requires quick and precise reactions, and the controls just aren't that snappy. I frequently find myself climbing ladders when all I wanted to do was back up to a wall, or throwing a punch when I was actually holding the mouse button to charge it. I couldn't even find out how to bring up the menu, it only appears when I alt+tab out and back in.  The 'manage your passengers' part also isn't great. I had no idea how far I was going to take them, so there wasn't much opportunity for rational decision making. The train systems are also pretty boring, it's just running from side to side and clicking stuff mindlessly.  I played this for about two hours yesterday and decided I'd refund it, but to my surprise, when I got back to my computer today, I had almost 20 hours of play time because, even though i quit the game, the executable kept running on the task manager overnight and Steam kept counting. Just keep that in mind if you're going to give this a try.",

This game, was ok. the gameplay was great, it had some elements of HL2 and some scavenging from any end of the world game. but i cant rate it a thumbs up. too many questions left unknown, at some points it got repetitive, theres no 'oh hey that was sorta funny' moments. its the end of the world but you can atleast add in an anti joke, my god. i want to compare this game to a flash game from the 2004s(?) and the name is lost upon me. you went around and tried to piece up the puzzle of how the world ended. it had these elements this game had itself. but atleast by the 5th and last game it atleast answered ♥♥♥♥. this game didnt answer much of anything. and who knows who X. was. hes just some magical note writer. this game was good gameplay wise. story wise... not good. i want to like this game, believe me i do! but its just not able to narrate what it wants from the player. everything you do in the game is useless. and at the end, who the hell knows what is going to happen next. maybe if the DLC can atleast explain things. until then, this game is a no.

The bits of story you might be able to salvage from replaying the game are negligible.   Multitasking and having to balance your resources on the train is underwhelming, and monotonous. Although the vistas in the background are pure eye candy, only the shreds of exposition revealed by the characters are of any real interest  I was expecting the need to switch up tactics when gunning through a new area, but like the rest of the game it is repetitive and minimalistic.  Translation errors abound, but this will not soil your experience.  This game feels like a development pitch rather than a full release. I adore indie efforts, but paying $15 for this half baked game was a joke and I regret it.      ",

            "review_text": "A nice short narrative with a solid linear gameplay design. The Final Station isn't exactly a deeply complex game, and it's also in no way a rougelike despite its resource management and survival gameplay. However, what's here is a game that's worth a playthrough for its plot, great world building, lore, fantastic atmosphere, and awesome visuals.   The combat feels very tactile and tight, giving you a feeling of total control of your weapons, with enemies being sufficiently tough without feeling too weak nor being on the verge on being bullet sponges. A lot of times, you're encouraged to run away or use certain environmental objects such as boxes, chairs and barrels to dispose of enemies, along with a basic melee attack so you can conserve your ammo for larger mobs.  The level design in terms of gameplay does get a bit repetitive, but the game's length is just about right so it never really verges on the feeling of overstaying its welcome. Going back to the visuals, one of the best things about The Final Station is behind its artwork, especially evident during train rides with beautiful vistas and barren wastelands evoking a very atmospheric environment.  Detailing further on the survival elements and resource management, The Final Station takes a similar approach to the Metro games rather than modern roguelikes. Shops are far between levels, and the game just provides a little bit more than enough resources to equip yourself while making sure every person on your train can come out alive, as long as you're playing it smart.  One of the most glaring issues behind The Final Station is perhaps on the fact that the game isn't also really all that difficult despite the survival elements. You can easily get the hang out of the resource management and train maintenance an hour into the game. Another thing, the game is also really generous when it comes to checkpoints, so deaths in the game rarely feels frustrating, making deaths feel like a light slap on the wrist. Despite being relatively light on the challenge though, it's still feels a lot of fun to go through and outsmart a large group of enemies using just barely enough weapons and resources. There's also an undeniable sense of accomplishment too when you are able to get all of your passengers to their destination alive and well, on top of the rewards you're handed out with.   Overall The Final Station isn't something you play for its length or replay value, but if you want a good solid linear experience after getting burnt out on open world games, or just want to trek through a nice entertaining train ride while looking at pretty scenery, The Final Station provides enough polished content to make it worth a playthrough.",

The combat had me switching between controller and K&amp;M to try to get an edge, all the while yelling F this S of a game at more regular intervals than I would like. Almost nothing bad that happened to me during my TWICE playthrough of this game was the fault of my actions, which vexed me to no end. Either the mechanics ♥♥♥♥ed me or the bugs did, either way I have a sore throat from yelling at my monitor. Also, spoiler alert... The ending is some of the weakest, poo-your-own-bed storytelling I HAVE EVER SEEN. This should have been procedurally generated.

You can survive simply by kiting the enemies and using your melee/charge melee (shotgun melee does more damage idk why) and provided you explore every stage completely, you will always have enough supplies for your passengers to live to their destinations. I ended with a ridiculous amount of unused medkits and ammo.  Other than that, really good stuff. Worth the money.",

Took me 4 hours to beat, then 2 hours worth of research to make sense of what I had just played through. Leaves you with a LOT of questions, and this is definitely the type of game you play for the atmosphere and not for the gameplay... The story had so much potential. If it had done the ending right and given us closure on all of the questions the game poses, it'd have been amazing. But since we never get any answers to all the many many... many questions, it leaves you feeling incomplete. I will forever have an itch I can not scratch now, because of this game. I'll continue to read up on things but... there are a lot of questions that need answering. If you like to be a part of a great debating discussion that will really really make you think in depth and leave your imagination running like a machine scrambling for answers and scrutinizing tiny tiny details, then play this game and then go to the discussion boards and have a field day. If you don't like having unanswered questions, major questions that would greatly impact your view and the meaning of the game, then don't play it.     Above all, I just want to know what 'Them' are... Most popular fan theory so far seems to be that they're aliens that travel with portals, but that makes no sense cause the scientist dude says they travel just barely slower than the train.... But you know, since when in video games (or in concept) have portals had travel speed?? Traveling by portal seems like it would be instant, so clearly 'Them' are not traveling by portal if they need to catch up to the train. And portals certainly didn't demolish the guardian.... Ugh I'm so so lost and confused and I want answers. I really hope the devs do something and don't let the game stay as-is.   ",

I recommend this game for anyone that is a fan of pixilated style suspense though there are some faults I experienced....   Taking care of the train and guests does take away from the storyline at times. Leaving the car to get food, meds, and/or fix the train delays dialouge and costs your other guests of health and hunger if you try to catch up with it all before arriving at your next stop. Another small problem I encountered was the enemies health. The enemies seemed rather easy to take down, usually 3-4 good hits to take a single enemy down. Even the large creatures, though visually meneacing are taken down with a feww good wacks of your weapon. If the later types were built up stronger, The last part of the game would feel a bit more challenging instead of just being able to melle them to death in a few blows.",

The game is based loosely around repition yes, though every new location you arrive at has a story that you can unravel by finding notes and clues. This game left a lot more questions than answers, and while this frustrates me, it doesn't make it a bad game.  It's short, mysterious, and it leaves you wanting more when you reach the end. Definitely worth the price. Expect about four hours of gameplay, give or take your play speed.  The only thing that irked me was the process of trying to keep people alive on the train between stations. They all have conversations between each station that elaborate on the plot, and I was so busy trying to keep the stupid train from breaking, and feeding them all to actually gather the full story.",

This game is more of like a mystery that has a really good story, but here's the funny part, it's NEVER solved. This game is fun when you play it but they explain nothing, especially at the end, leaving you wanting more, but the way the creators did it, it was a very bad decision. I guess they did fulfil the feeling of confusion an innocent bystander would feel in a zombie apocolypse type world, but what's the point of making a game that makes you feel like a bystander?   This game will leave you feeling uncompleted, curious, and utterly angered at how the developers leave you wondering why, what, and how.   If they were to add an update to the game that finished the story, I would give this game a good rating, but like I said, they leave you hanging.",

Reminded me of Limbo and INSIDE in some way, and that's a compliment to a highest degree. The gameplay seems a bit bulky at first, but you'll get over it. I was sold the very first seconds. Sounds are well done, and so is the music.  The train is a weird thing. It's kind of Diner Dash mini game where you have to make sure everyone is healthy and satisfied, and your train does not overload. The customers are talking something, but most of the time I'm missing it out as I'm dashing around. I'd love to read the discussion they're having from somewhere.  But then you start to get to more combat intensive places. Rooms full of enemies, low on clips and getting mauled time after time. Death has no meaning in this game, so you keep on trying and trying. I gave up. There was a ladder, and room full of baddies. Could not get to the room without dying. Could not shoot enemies from the floor below. I HATE THOSE LADDERS.  Also, cardboard boxes and other items seem to be much more effective than the pistol. Fair enough. Ended up carrying a toilet seat half the map just in case :P  I'm not happy with the game. It just doesn't seem to have enough interesting gameplay to warrant the price or my time. All the places seem alike, and there is very little interesting things in there. Story is told via static scenery and post-it notes.. rather easy solution for game with designed levels.  Makes me wish it was some roguelike/procedurally generated game (honestly I though it would be like that based on the trailer though they did not make any claims about it. It just felt like that). Feels like a missed opportunity.  Unfortunately I cannot recommend the game in its current form (the usual I'd give it a 'meh' but due to lack of it it's thumbs down).  EDIT:  Finally finished the game. Unfortunately it turned out to be quite bad. While progressing, the feeling of detachment became stronger and stronger. The story, which is actually quite hard to understand and badly written to be honest, does not have any build-up towards the ending. The ending was a huge disappointment. There was no focus on the protagonist, his motives, or background, leaving the ending quite cold and uninteresting.  The game is full of beautiful vistas and thick atmosphere, but instead of cohesive whole it started to feel like I'm jumping from scenario to another without any actual drama, and more like just for the sake of showing different environments.   Anyway. There's a real effort here, but unfortunately it doesn't not work.  Not recommended unless you get it really cheap and have few hours to waste.",

Overall I'd give this a recommend but the ending is what really started killing me. *SPOILERS* It ends with gunshot fade to black in the most by the books ending way ever.  If you ever play this game and start thinking about Lisa you aren't wrong for thinking that. By the time he made his first phone call I immeditly could tell what was going to happen in the end. The ending pretty much knocked a pretty soild 9/10 down to a 6 or 7/10. Still a fun game if you can ignroe the painfully cliche wrap up but prepare yourself for a groner.  Also I was expecing more levels. I watched a quick letsplay of one of the levels an noticed how big the map was and how many places I could go. WARNING, YOU ONLY GO TO HALF OF THE PLACES. That's pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥.  I do like the switch between train management and platformer shooting, but was kinda hoping for more train stuff. Maybe a passanger turns and attacks you or a hoard comes or something. The diolog from the messaging will get ingored when you have to run back to repower or heal or feed so I would like to see a better way of exposing that diolog without me having to stop everything a read it. Some of the little mini games took a few replays to figure out but it's nothing that would really prevent you from going on. I do remember the screen with the lines and dots part being really annoying to figure out and over all became me spamming buttons.  Also a big problem I faced was that some of the text on certain papers wouldnt come up no matter how many times I tried reading. And for a story where most of it's lore comes from the minor details that was pretty annoying, atleast the number is automatically put at the bottom of the screen so reading the paper isn't nessary for progression.  but I did feel like a lot of effort was put into the world of this game and thats what I like about it the most, it's just s shame not enough was put into the story to make it stand out from the others.",

The only problem I noticed (and it's kind of a major one) is the NIGHTMARISH dialogue/translation. The speech/dialogue isn't realllly key to the game/story but some parts of it are so badly translated it's just unreadable/unintelligible. For how 'trippy' the game is it almost fits but you can tell it's REALLY obviously not done intentionally. Needs a major patch asap fixing the multitude of dialogue/translation errors.  TLDR: Great game, Great music, spoopy as well at times. Nightmarish translation of dialogue. I'd give it a solid 8/10 I would probably normally give it a 10/10 but my god some of the dialogue is so painfully unreadable I just can't.",
