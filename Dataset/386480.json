            "review_text": "There are some errors with translations and grammar not quite sounding correct, however, that will be easily fixed as more updates come out. The game itself is beautiful art wise, and the soundtrack is relaxing and pleasing to listen to. (There are a few area where the music will jump in volume to be quite loud though, so please be carefull of that.) The backgrounds are stunning, and the badges and emotes are pretty cute as well, the cards are pretty dull in comparison to the rest of the unlockables, but they are still fairly adorable. (backgroud and lvl 1 badge examples are on my page, as my background and featured badge)  The gameplay is slightly different to other sims I've played because of the schedule planning, but when it comes down to it, this is a stat raising game. Although it's still easy to enjoy since the stat requirements don't need obsessive grinding to pass the test at the end of each game month, and the stat test only raises by about 200 points each time, so as long as you have 2 or 3 study days a week you're good. You have to visit each place once or twice in order to unlock the jobs, and then you can start earning money for items.  It reminds me of Nicole, due to some aspects of the story, but I don't think you can actual investigate in the same way you stat raise. You just have to let the mystery unfold along with the game's cutscenes. However cutscenes happen at least once a game week, so it's not like Dandelion where you have really long wait periods of nothing but stat grinding. And the stat skill are all counted as one stat for the end of game month checks, so the only stat that actually matters on it's own would be the one that corresponds to your chosen route.  The characters are charming, and although there are cliche aspects, they are done in a way that makes it hard to hate any of them. The designs of the characters aren't super unique, but the changes in their faces and stance when you chose different dialogue options are amazing details that allow their personalities to shine through. The voice acting however is the one thing I wasn't too happy with. The voices are great fits for the characters, but the lines tend to be read emotionless. (Or maybe I just can't pick up emotion very well in chinese.) And, again an audio problem, the voice actors can be very hard to hear due to the music spiking in volume for certain tracks, so I found myself having to readjust my audio settings quite a few times.  Overall, it is a very nice Ootome, and I would absolutely recommend it just for the art alone, but the entire game is just so well done that it makes it well worth the price. Although it's already very cheap compared to most of the Ootomes on steam at the moment.   NOTE: I haven't finished any of the routes yet, but I'll be adding to this review as I go through. Based on the fact that I have over 4 hours so far in the game (and I think not even half way through my first route), I'm really happy with the length and quality of the stories. I say stories since a good half of the main story cutscenes so far have been centered more towards the guy I'm going for first, so I assume I can safely say that you won't have to go through the same exact main story and cutscenes each play through like quite a few of the Ootomes I've played.",

            "review_text": "Everything is good and pro except the story. Storyline is okay, but just ok. It make sense, but it really could be better. Voice are not good, few actors did really good job, but most of the voice actor are so died. (even make them feels more died) Game mech is kind simillar to Wuxia (武林群侠传) or GaoKao 100 days (高考恋爱100天).  Art style is really great, nice UI design, even few videos, I saw lots of AfterEffects works, which might be nice I guess. Code part has nothing to complain, everthing works just like it design, since NV game does not need way too much coding. Last thing might be the DLC. Since I alreally got the DLC, which add few more dresses with powerful functions, I would say it is a smart way to sell DLC or what? I don't know, but i kind like these dresses. －－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－ Update: What the hell, this game is better than I thought. Even seems I missed lots of the plots, but still impressive to me.",

Although I had a kid, but not with the person I was going for.  ♥♥♥♥ING DATING SIM RUINED MY LIFE! but it was a fun game. on the other hand it's anime too... i like this and it was fun, just don't make a mistake when romancing a character like i did. you also have 5 mabye 6 exames before the game ends, well for me. but i wanted christ. -3- Part of me wants to re-try for Christ's ending (!the happy ending!), and part of me wants to leave it as it is and forget about it.  Lock's ending(normal one) made me feel sad but happy at the same time. i never went on a date with lock but i gave christ a present after i went on a date with him. why did i get lock's ending?!?!  plot: 9/10 romantic: 9/10 fun: 9/10  I played this for 7 hours, but if you don't plan and rush it you might bring it down to 2-3 hours but if you just spam click space 1-2 hours mabye. i think 2 or 3 hours of me playing was me leaving it on...",

I broke up with a character I didnt even know I was dating until the breakup scene.  - Gameplay gets tiring after only a few minutes and is generally not well enough explained. - Plot is extremly boring, choppy, and slow. not enough happend during months to keep me involved in this games chracters or story.    Minor issues -  - Some akward internal dialog such as '(o.o orz)' and even 'LOL' - The teacher is a very weird choice for datable character. - datable characters seemed pretty uniform personality wise and didnt really feel like you were chosing diffrent people just a diffrent face (If that makes any sense)   overal I really tried to stick it out to the end with this game but it was just too drawn out and incohesive for me to contine maybe when the english translation is improved it will be better due to most it's problems steming from unbearable translation.",
