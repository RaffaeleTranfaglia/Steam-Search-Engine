That said this is possibly the best star wars FPS ever made.   edit* It appears we have been heard, now it actually lets you know that there is a chance it wont work on modern systems.. of course its hidden pretty well but at least its there.. a drastic improvement from over 2 years ago.

Then why am I NOT recommending this? Simple: Steam and whoever else is involved do not support this game AT ALL. From the moment I have installed this game, nothing but compatibility issues have bubbled up, and after several hours of troubleshooting, I now have a game that crashes for no apparent reason. What's amazing is that each time you play, new bugs show up. I'm sure that there is no way I could ever finish this game as the bugs are thicker than welfare recipients at a detroit mcdonalds.   Steam: I highly recommend you fix this disaster. You know what you have done, and it's proabably not that hard to fix on your side. Just make it useable for OSs after XP and we are golden.",

Partly due to nostalgia for a game that I grew up with, but despite somewhat out-dated graphics there is still great gameplay. The levels aren't all boring straightforward run and shoot, and it still contains the best lightsabre use of any starwars game I've played to date.  However. This version of the game takes so much work to actually run that i'm amazed that steam has released it as is (and have not even attempted to fix). I needed to install old graphics drivers, run in compatibility mode, download the music separately (outside of steam) and insert into the files manually. Thankfully the steam community has a couple of walkthroughs on how to get the game to run. But - desptie this it will still regularly crash when exiting a menu, or after saving the game.  I would not reccommend you buy the steam version of it only due to these horrible compatibility problems (apparently the GOG version works much better).",

Well, and here comes the point, why I rated it negative...it simply doesn't work on newer Systems. It just crashes and that's it. Of course there is help, but the things you have to do, to get it even started are complicated and not worth the trouble. So I bought it again on  GOG.com , and yep it's running. Why does Steam sell an old version, that's not able to run on modern Systems, when there clearly is a version that runs from the first start?!",

The models can look horrible at times, but overall the immense levels create a sense of immersion rarely seen in games these days. The level design is top notch, the length of each level is very long, and the variety of weapons is perfect. This is a Star Wars game at its best. The storyline is well done too, though the video produced cutscenes are cheesy at best, but at least they keep the story going, and the story gives you reason and meaning to why you are fighting. I did have some issues with the game. The amount of times that I died and had to restart from a save from a long time ago was very frustrating. I wish this game had auto save, which would have been perfect when specific goals on your objectives were completed. Also, the lack of the audio music from Star Wars (which was played from the CD in the original format) is absent in this Steam version. I watched the credits without any Star Wars music, and throughout the game it was the same.  This game is a classic. If you love Star Wars and don't mind the dated graphics, you're in for a great adventure. Highly recommended.",

Strong gameplay, good graphics for it's time, great difficulty, well made maps and some of the best live action cutscenes you'll ever find.  It's funny replaying this old gem, a shooter from a time when level design was sprawling and non-linear, where enemies were numerous and survival was actually difficult you start to notice things about modern games. One strange observation I've made, playing this again after so many years, is that I can see the path from this game directly through Bioware's modern aRPG's, from Jade Empire to Mass Effect 3 so much of it have it's roots in Lucasart's Jedi Knight series. It is a shame that they took the simple RPG elements and basic morality system instead of the superb shooter and exploration elements. Such a shame.  A really great game that everyone needs to have played.",

            "review_text": "Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II is the second game in the Jedi Knight Series. With some new tech in the engine, actually its a whole new engine. Some keen ideas in the story, and a few role-playing game elements mixed in. Jedi Knight is a visible step up from the path that Dark Forces paved. But just how much of a step is it, and will it surpass its predecessors Breakdown?  Jedi Knight, in my opinion, has some of the best story telling I’ve seen in games of its era. It uses what has almost become a lost art, full motion video. So many games today are switching over to scripted sequences that are rendered right in the game with the engine carrying the load. While this can be a great tool for the story telling, at times the better tool is a FMV sequence. The other great thing about Jedi Knight’s FMV’s are that they use live actors. Actual people interacting with the CGI characters at the CGI locations. That does a great job of putting you in the world with a small graphic budget.  Jedi Knight had very little compatibility issues, I simply installed it within Steam and in minutes was playing. At first I had some interesting graphical problems, but with a little help from the Steam Community I got things working in fine order. The resolution is changeable, but 1280 x 1024 is the highest it goes. Which was not issues for me, since that’s what I operate with these days.  The game does play full screen, but it goes windowed in between levels and to show the FMV’s. This sometimes caused issues where the full screen shows a blinking or faded border. Not a game breaker, but was just an eye-sore.  Controls were a bit clunky, especially the lightsaber combat. Fighting Storm Troopers was easy enough, but once you had to fight another Jedi it became a real conflict. There was a definite delay from mouse-click to saber-swing, which made fighting the more challenging foes that much more challenging. Also Jedi Knight has a auto-aim feature, something akin to the games predecessors, like Doom and Quake. You only need aim in the general direction and the game will make sure the target is hit. There are times where this is great and brings the skill level of the game down a notch or two, and a couple points where its an annoyance.  The grenades, or Thermal Detonators as the game would call them, even though actual Thermal Detonators would be far more powerful than what appears in the game. Either way, they are virtually useless. A simple click while holding one will practically drop it at your feet. You throw them at an odd arc that I was unable to get the hang of during my play. By holding down the fire button you can throw the Det further, but the angles were too hard for me to master and I typically just threw it into the wall or ceiling.  Jedi Knight has a Light/Dark pseudo system. There is a point in the story where you make the choice of Light or Dark. This choice is made for you, based on your actions up to that point. If you were bad and killed too many non-hostile NPC’s then you’ll go the dark route. I was actually bummed when I got the dark route. I’d known I had killed a few non-hostiles, but had hoped it wasn’t too many. And unfortunately I had learned about the prospect of different endings too late into the game, and didn’t want to start it all over again. So I had just been hoping for the best.  The levels are fairly par for the time. Mostly inside buildings, with doors, switches, and decent lighting. Most of the maps have you searching for a key or switch to unlock the other side of the map. Often this is easy enough, however there were a couple times where the door or switch was annoyingly hard to locate. In many cases doors are simply a different sheet metal looking texture, and have no marking to show its a door. And switches can be found in some very strange places. There was many a time where I strafed walk along a wall rapidly tapping the ‘Use’ key. Jedi Knight also makes sure to fill the Star Wars cliche of massive bottomless chasms to fall into.  The maps are typicality very large, you can tell the developers were going for that classic Star Wars feel of large spaces. Many times you can see out windows or over ledges to these vast expanses. These must have looked nicer years ago. Because now I feel a lot of the effect is lost in the lower end graphics. You can clearly see the repeating textures and where the map surface ends and the skybox begins. Sometimes this is hidden fairly well with fading, as a way to try and preserve the feel of distance.  Overall the game is pretty solid. It has parts that have short comings, but they all fit together nicely. Showing just how solid of a game it was back in its day. It shows a good level of improvement from its predecessor, which raises hopes of a continues level of improvement into the rest of the series. There are far worst games from the late nineties that you could play.  With a few exceptions, one of the biggest being the headaches some of these older games cause, I did enjoy my time with Jedi Knight. It was nice to venture back in time with Kyle Katarn. I know him well in many Star Wars novels, but finally get to take the time to really learn his backstory.",

But yeah, like most people here I am disappointed because I cant get this sucker to run properly. Either the colors are all messed up or the ratio is totally off, it crashes, I cant see my HUB and so on. Spend several hours, tried some mods, some fixes, read several help instructions how to fix it, tried different graphic options but still cant play this. I think steam should only offer games here which are able to run on modern systems without witchery or should clearly warn if it is problematic to run on modern systems.",

Unless you're running a fairly old video card (not as old as this game, but at least 5 years), you probably won't be able to run it 3D accelerated. The chunky textures aren't that bad, but it would have been nice to see the textures blended a little. Checking off the 3D accelerated setting will just cause the game to lock up for a minute and crash to the desktop.  Also, cut scenes and menu screens are, oddly, rendered at the native 640x480, so they open in a small window in one corner of the screen.   By modern standards, I give it a solid C grade. It's a good game, but there's a certain expectation when a game is put back on the market that it'll be modified to function properly on the mainstream hardware of today. I already own the boxed version of the game, and when it went on Steam, I expected them to have fixed those problems before putting it up for sale again. The absolute lack of support for this game just takes it down another notch.",

            "review_text": "Ah yes, I have a lot of fond memories of this game from when I was younger. Going through the singleplayer story and messing and having a bit of fun with the multiplayer.  When I saw the game on Steam, I had to get it. But there's a few problems I ran into.   You'll notice right away that the main menu is windowed. There is no way to make it full screen. The game itself has the opposite problem; It's full screen all the time with no way to make it windowed. If you want to change a setting while playing the game you'll have to do it through the small window. And it's not really an instant thing to do. The game will black out and you'll have to wait a second to do anything. It can be pretty annoying since it also does the same thing when you're done with the menu can go back to playing the game. You can change your display in-game but this is just for the game itself. And it's not recommended to have your game be something like 1920x1080 since it'll make the HUD really small.   The game runs just fine without any major problems that I noticed aside from wanting to make some adjustments to the controls. However it's noticable that there's no music. When you're in a bar or something, that has it's own little jingle. But the game has it's own music to play in addition which is absent in the steam version. So for the most part it's silence. You might not mind that though but it's worth mentioning.   There's lots of secrets to find and the levels each are pretty lengthy. You eventually do become a Jedi with force powers and that's alot of fun to use. There's a lightside and a dark side ending. I think some missions have differences depending on the route you're on but I forget the specific details.  I would have to say that this game is one of my favorite star wars games or FPS games in general. But with the Steam it's bit harder to recommend. I've heard people having plenty of issue with the game that I didn't run into, strangely enough. I'd recommend getting the game physically or via GOG.",

Not to sound mean, but why couldn't you constantly update the game from time to time, other than the fact that a certain company that some of you might know bought the rights to make Star wars games? maybe you guys can rerelease the game modded to run on ALL PCs, including windows 7, 8.1, 10 and other modern computers. And maybe you can give it to the people who have the original game for free. I would try modding, but I'm not good at this stuff. It's best you guys get it on gog.

(Windows 8.1) - not even close. You have to patch the game to run it with 3D acceleration, and I couldn't run it in fullscreen (there was a window border visible). - It can crash out of nowhere and never run again untill reinstall - Sometimes it's not clear where to go to advance further in level - Low differentation of enemies (there are Stormtroopers and more Stormtroopers)",

For an FPS it has a nice mix of puzzlework/pathfinding trying to accomplish goals throughout the levels. Lightsaber combat isn't as satisfying as Jedi Academy and the gameplay is more or less a shooter, but its great in its own way.

The game has a nice mixture of platforming and shooting. There is a fine variety of weapons. Some of the game's levels are good and some are bad, some being too large or spread out and some objectives being obfuscated so that it is unclear how to progress. Some levels are visually repetitive and consist of black, grey, and red Imperial buildings over and over again. The game has 'secrets' which are nice to try and find throughout the levels. The game's story is very incoherent and 'cheeseballs', and will send the main character to places without much explanation, usually to the tops of towers/buildings. The villian is a discount Emperor. The game also features FMV movies which are usually silly but entertaining to watch. Sometimes the way to progress is obtuse and may require looking up, such as if a door doesn't look like a door, or a switch you need to activate is small and out of the way.  Overall, the game is funnish. You may find it hard to fully get through unless you don't have a lot to play or it being a Star Wars game means a lot to you. If I were to rate it on a /10 scale, I'd give it a 7/10. It's better than Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy.",
