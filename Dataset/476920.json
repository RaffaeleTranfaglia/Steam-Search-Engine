            "review_text": "The amount of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in this game. Where do I begin... I had to travel between worlds for a can opener, to use the oil in the can to remove the rust off an iron piece that I'll attach later on to an armor to unlock a gate to go somewhere where I have to look into unlocking a chest to find a smiling mask to put on a sad statue next to a bridge before I cross it... Why can't I just cross the ♥♥♥♥ing bridge in the first place?? Everything in this game makes no sense, I forgot what was the story or what I need to do and all the crap in my inventory idk what to do with it. GET YOUR ♥♥♥♥ TOGETHER! Just stop with this crap, make a simple nice game that people will enjoy instead of stretching it out as much as possible to make it long enough to increase the selling price. Now I need some tea and painkillers so I can get the bloody achievements.",
