            "review_text": "Lets start with what I didn't like with the game. 1. Controls:   -The Map interaction really shows that this was made for a touchdevice to begin with, it's a thing to get used to but annoying when you are new to the game.  - Combat is a just watching the game play itself as you will auto attack instantly and consistently as soon as an enemy is comes close. You have your Manual attacks that is an Uppercut or a Slam (downward) attack but they are weak unless you wait long enough for your auto-attack to build up enough rage (skulls on the top) to make them stronger. This is fine for a touchgame when you have a limited amount of 'buttons' to use to not disturbe you visual of the screen for the gameplay but a huge flaw when you have an actual controller to play with. For me this was a really fun draining aspect of the control.  Otherwise the movement is very solid and responsive and you can get a really good flow (wich is needed with combat mechanics mentioned above.  Graphics, sound were all good though. Story I can't say much about since I didn't get very far in to the game due to the offputting controls.   If I had the choice again then I would rather have picked this up on an IOS device rather than getting it here for PC. All the positive feedbacks in this review area fooled me though. Maybe I will give this another chance later but not right now.  Wether or not this will be helpful to you I can't say. Just be sure to know what you are paying for, the controls are a major thing to consider if seeking a fun little game to play. This is just way to casual for my taste to be played on a PC with a controller.",

            "review_text": "There are a lot of things to like about this game. The RPG mechanics are wonderful - equips feel unique and useful, and the customization on level-up is very well done. Character design is cute, and the art style overall is quality. It seems to me that this game would have high replay value.  However, actual gameplay, the most important part of the game, feels clunky and unresponsive. The autoattack mechanic is inspired, but not executed well. I found myself using unempowered manual attacks for the most part. The worst part of the combat, for me, was that it rarely felt like it was my fault for getting hit. This is hugely important - when you take damage, it should be because you did something wrong (except special circumstances like trading hits), and you should be able to learn from your mistake and avoid it in the future. When I got hit, it rarely felt deserved. Melee attacks from enemies have wonky hitboxes, most notably, and avoiding them feels more like a battle with the game's design than with the game itself. Dashing feels extremely clunky. The input (double tap a direction) provides too long a window, and I found myself dashing accidentally when I was only trying to adjust my position precisely. This led to frequent dashes off ledges (falling deals 50 damage, half of your base life) and just as often straight into projectile attacks, as dashing does not provide any invulnerability frames. This was really frustrating to deal with, and the rest of the gameplay just couldn't make up for this and other shortcomings.   I really wanted to like this game, and there were definitely many well-done aspects, but it failed to provide an enjoyable experience overall due to just a few small, consistent problems.",

And naturally after playing the first 10 lvls, that were in the game, before you had to upgrade to one of 3 versions, i chose the 3 star version just to support the devs of the game. To my big surprise it was released on Steam and for me this was an instant purchase, no questions asked. It might just be a straight port, which does not bother me what so ever, because it is an awesome and fun game.  So instant purchase for me, well worth the 5£",

            "review_text": "This game was ... okay  the game has some of the worst map navigation controls i have ever seen same with the shop. i found my self unable to go to certain location for no apprant reason which was highly annoying when im trying to enter a store.  The biggest problem i have is how the money drops i was no aware this game was taking place on the moon becaus the way the money bounces it sure bloody seems like it, i found my self having to both ignore the fighting im doing to chase after every coin and nugget which most of the time are moving so fast i cant get them before they go off screen. this become a very very huge problem when ever you find a chest, after the 2nd chest i just ignored them as i would only be able to get a tiny amount of what was in the chest as the rest decided to bounce of screen. i also found my self having to be mean to everyone to get more money so i could buy better supplies to i can play the game which highly annoyed me because i felt like i didnt have any choices in the dialoge.   That being said the combat is interesting i dont like it but its a lot nicer on my thumbs the only problem is with the amount of enemies you have to fight against and there being no block other than the one that can randomly happen you quickly find your self getting bored as you feel like you're getting little to no imput in the fighting you're just having to sit back and watch it happen, another problem being that with the amount of enemies you fight there are no health pick ups that can be dropped by the enemies ( or at least i never got a single one) which forces you to try and be carful when fighting but when every enemy moves faster than you ( this is after leveling up my speed) i had to use my charge to catch up and if i had a golden rage skull i use it up charging to catch up to them just so i can fight, the fact that a lot of the bacground you can bounce on was really cool for about 30 seconds until you jump to fight an enemy and then you cant get down because you keep bouncing on it  the game it self ignoreing the flaws i give it 3/5 because of all the problems i give it a 2.5/5",

It's infuriating how much gold is lost because it flies off the screen faster than you can chase it, and you have to spend most of your Rage dashing to nab some of it before it disappears forever, exposing yourself to enemies in the process. The movement controls also feel clunky, and having no control over your normal attacks (they're done automatically) makes effective fighting more difficult than it needs to be.  It's a shame, because some polishing could really turn this into a great game.",

Controls are bearable, but come on, this is supposed to be a fighting game, and the fighting is terrible! You have to stand close to enemies to AUTOMATICALLY hit them, risking getting hit... And the character either reacts, or it does not. The only real fighting moves you control are the special moves, which consume the 'rage' you build up by standing close to enemies. Jumping does not help either, because there are almost invisible background pieces that will hurt you, like fences, spiky weeds and other stuff. The shopping system is hard to understand, the story is basically moving on the map, while having semi-interesting conversations with characters you don't care about. Collecting money is a pain in the ♥♥♥, as anytime you 'open' a chest or kill an enemy that drops coins, the whole money bag just explodes and coins are flying out of the frame, usually right in the middle of a fight. Your character is slow as ♥♥♥♥ and you can't chase the coins either, they are also bouncing all over the place. It's a meaningless grind, the game rewards fighting with more fighting.

Overall, it has fun, easy to learn mechanics and great visual style that is probably what grabbed your attention in the first place - and this stays true till the very end of the game. Slashig enemies is easy, bouncing between them, killing, racking up gold... is all fun, and makes you come back for that one quest/encounter/try again and again.  At the same time, it has some serious issues that make for most poorly implemented 'difficulty' I've encountered - Close to no telegraphing of attacks on most enemies, making you just sneak two hits and jump behind them till they finally die - Infuriating placement of background objects that don't limit enemies whatsoever, while can single-handedly kill you if you don't keep away. Even jumping-vines, which do no damage, are a hassle because they limit ability to land without expending rage - Game essentially becomes bullet hell at some point, while character is so limited in free movement (without wasting rage) and so sluggishly slow in air, that it is total pain - Everything is balanced around having Greed perk; on encounters leading to getting it, game is getting absurdly difficult, while just after taking it - feels like a breeze for a while  Seems like I shouldn't recommend it... but I actually will. It has tons of flaws, but as long as you want easy-to-grasp gameplay and don't mind artificial difficulty that makes you play encounters like it was disarming a bomb, it is fun.  The core of Reaper's gameplay is fun enough to make the flaws not ruin it.  PS. Don't buy this game if you don't have a pad. Keyboard controls are absolute pain to work with.",
