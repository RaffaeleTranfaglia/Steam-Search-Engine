            "review_text": "Rating: 8/10  Overview: Top down Hack and Slash  The Good  +The game has 6 main characters: paladin, ranger, wizard, warlock, priest and thief. Each character has their own unique combat traits, skills and passive abilities. Playing with different characters to see how they play differently is part of the fun. Collecting gold throughout the game allows you to unlock new skills and abilities from shop vendors.   +The main game is split into 4 acts. Each act contains 3 dungeon levels. Each level contains a seal that you have to unlock to fight the boss for each act. Every level on the dungeon contains secrets and hidden passage ways. Exploring and finding these secrets is rewarding.  +The bonus campaign is handled differently and just as fun. This bonus campaign is much less linear and allows you travel back to previously visited levels, it is also much harder. Sadly, you cannot transfer your main character to this campaign.   +The game pushes a ton of enemies on screen. The pixelated graphics work really well in that regard.   +Cool boss battles  +Steam workshop support means there are plenty of custom maps you can play  +The multiplayer community is still active and I was always able to find and join a game easily.    The Average  -difficulty achievements do not stack  The Bad  - The game can get very repetitive at times. Unlike most ARPG's this game doesn't have a robust character creation making things somewhat boring after awhile. This game has no loot providing little incentive to kill all the enemies. I found myself playing in short sessions simply because the game play formula started to wear thin the farther I went along.   Conclusion  This is a game you play to try out different characters that fit your play style and then kill wave after wave of enemy as you progress through the level. If that excites you then this is a game for you. This game is ARPG lite and for the most part, works very well but if you are looking for something with a bit more depth you may be disappointed with what this game has to offer. ",

The setup of the multiplayer is really easy and there are different game-modes in the default pack and you can download a few more on the official site.  The only thing i was bothered by is the imbalance of the classes. I have 3 other friends who played it solo or with each other and we all agree that the ranger is the class you can easily get very far with. The second one but still immensely weaker is the wizard. The melee classes(paladin and warlock) are just way too underpowered.  But I still have 30h+ playtime already, mostly with the ranger and the wizard. I do not regret buying this game AT ALL.  9/10",

Since there is any kind of tutorial (you have to press ESC -&gt; Help to see the commands and stuff), it was a bit hard to understand the mechanism.  Once you get to know how to play, you are going further deep to the dungeon and realize that this game is hard (note that I only play in Hard difficulty). It requires quick hand and a lot of strategy when facing enemies.   Game has a great depth. There are traps, secret doors, bosses, NPCs with which you can upgrade yourself, and you scarcely find extra lifes around.   It might be a little bit frustrating or repetitive when playing alone, but it shines at it's maximum on Multiplayer.  Playing this game on skype with 1~3 friends is really nice and recommended. It's easy to connect through IP or just invite directly from Steam.  Music is awesome.  The only thing I'm maybe missing is the capability of getting new gear (the fact of improving your skills is great though).  Overall I would recommend this game to play with somebody, and wouldn't recommend it much for the solo play.  8.5/10.",

Edit: Months and months later, I am still playing Hammerwatch. This is a truly amazing game with a devoted indie team that is continually supporting us with new content for free. The new campaign was amazing. Seriously, they could have called it a whole new game and charged more money for it, and I would have been happy.

This is a must buy for any old school gamer or even newer gen gamers, I just finished this game and I have about 40 hours in it. The expansion is long considering the the length of the items you have to obtained, the down fall in this expansion is there is only two bosses, that are pretty easy to kill. I was hoping for the expansion to be alot longer and have more bosses, maybe in the next expansion if they create one. The other plus side to the game is player made maps, I have tried out the editor and feels very clunky for a novice user.

            "review_text": "Brilliantly done retro Action RPG that is a lot of fun to play with friends. The goal of the game is to get through a number of sprawling dungeons, filled with enemies, loot, obscure secrets and boss fights, with a big emphasis on combat and looting.  The gameplay reminds me a lot of Zelda: A Link To The Past in the way you control your character, though instead of fighting one and one enemy, here it is all about fighting stupidly huge hordes of enemies and getting the highest kill combos possible to activate special abilities, while also dodging a large ammount of projectiles, which lend itself really well to this type of gameplay due to it's smooth controlls. However, you do want to play it with friends, as there appears to be little to no difficulty scaling according to the ammount of players, and you are gonna die a lot if you don't have some friends with you to help.  Something also worth noting is that despite it's retro look and game style, it avoids going into Rougelike territory and instead opts with premade maps and a extra lives system, which I like myself as I prefer a well designed static map and more tries per game, though if you want your experience to be randomized you might have to look elsewhere for that. However, the game comes bundled with a map editor so you can make your own dungeons to spice things up after beating the official campaign.   It's a bit repetitive, but as a pure multiplayer game it's entertaining, challenging without being unfair most of the time and sports a great retro look and feel without having that limit the quality of the gameplay itself. Worth checking out for sure along with some friends.",

            "review_text": "I still haven't been able to finish this game all the way through, but I have had one hell of a good time so far. Having several classes to choose from makes each runthrough all the more different and having those vendors set up all around the dungeons makes for a seemingly endless number of possibilities of how your run will turn out. Part of me wishes that it was a randomly generated dungeon each time, because I think it would work very well for this game, but it seems to be fine how it is, the dungeons are confusing enough, random generation would make me go insane. And from what I take from the story, you have been separated from your group due to a collapsed bridge and you're forced to traverse the monster dwelling dungeon to reach your goal. Gold, mana crystals, food, keys, and other items will aide you throughout your quest. Fight monsters/bosses, solve puzzles, upgrade your character, you name it! All can be done in the game, Hammerwatch.  There are quite a few games nowadays that use pixel-art to stylize their games, but in many occasions, it's not never well done and looks similar to something drawn in MSpaint. HOWEVER this is not one of those games. Whoever made this game should be patted on the back and given a firm handshake for the look of this game. This game is dang beatiful, if I may say so myself. The use of shaders is also very well done. The realistic lighting, bloom/glow effects, dark and colorised lighting makes it just that much better and works well to set the general dark mood of the game.  One issue that I have run into is the saving. You save by standing on a checkpoint and it overwrites your previous save to one designated run slot. If you died, you can re-load the save and you'll start back from the last time you reached a checkpoint. BUT, this can be extremely aggrivating if you save at a checkpoint with low health. You'll continue to start back with that same amount of health until you find some food, and if you're in a position where there's basically none, you'll have to die and die and die and die untill eventually you weasel your way through the dungeon on scraps that the enemies drop.   Another issue I've found is the difficulty. Bear in mind I was on the Medium difficulty and you can set it to Easier in-game, I'm just noting my experience. After a few floors have passed you'll find yourself being bombarded with constantly respawning enemies at 'nests'. They spawn so quickly that it's inevitable that you're going to take a few hits while trying to take it out. This is find for one or two nests, but when there are like 15 in one room, you're basically ♥♥♥♥ed. And I was on Medium, I couldn't imagine doing that on hard mode. Other than those blasted nests, the enemies are pretty fairly balanced, you got slow moving large-healthed monsters, fast moving low-healthed, very slow moving but capable of shooting projectiles. Difficult at first but once you get the hang of it, you'll be fine.  Other than these two extremely miniscule issues, this game is perfect. I highly recommend picking it up at full price or on sale.",

On each floor theres a red switch, when you've pressed all three then the door to the boss of that act opens. Each level is filled with secret doors and puzzles that you can find to get extra gold. Theres also alot of game referances in the secrets you find. the gameplay is from a top down view, you kill monsters and collect loot while finding shops to buy upgrades. I would advise playing with a controller but i played with a keyboard aswell and it worked fine.The only thing that is truly annoying is that there's no save while playing multiplayer and it takes about 6 hours to beat the whole game.

It seems well polished, has fairly pleasant music, but nothing really sets it apart or makes it special.  I killed hundreds upon hundreds of identical enemies in rooms that all kind of felt the same. The game warns you in the beginning that it's especially difficult, but it took around an hour, maybe more, before I even took a single hit (normal difficulty). The two bosses I encountered were 'difficult', in the sense that they did hit me a fair bit, but there were so many extra lives being thrown at me that they were never actually a threat. I'd enter the boss fight with ten lives, lose two or three of them to the boss, and then gain five as a reward.  The game seemed alright when I started, but after a while I found myself just waiting for it to be over. I just spent way too much time essentially repeating the same fight over and over. Stand still and shoot into a crowd of 100 skeletons until they're gone. Move to the next room. Repeat.  I'd give this game like a 6/10 rating. Not what I consider a bad game, as it seems to be polished and do what the devs wanted it to. But not an especially good game either, as what it does is pretty unremarkable.",

The different characters means you have several ways even at that to do it and the checkpoints say that there is only a set amount of errors or not. Lives do play a factor so spend them wisely. It's like i'm playing gauntlet all over again. All though i'm not spending quarters standing at my feet with 3 other's at the cabinet is not the feeling there. The curvature on the screen feature at least gives me the benefit to have it somewhat like i'm there. It helps relive some suble memory of it being a arcade cabinet while having fun. Even traders have set upgrades for gold. Personaly i'd reccomend this to anybody who has had a arcade cabinet childhood.",

Collect treasure to purchase your upgrades from vendors. Loot is shared and one class is a healer, so cooperation is easier done here than in 8bit Gauntlet. There are also boss fights along the way.   The art is nice, adding variety to levels and enemies while still evoking a sense of retro gaming. Additionally, you can change the parameters. Play with limited or infinite lives, for example, so you can scale the game to a difficulty level that suits you. Essentially, any thought you might have had along the lines of, 'You know, I liked Gauntlet as a kid... but I wish they had added XYZ,' that XYZ is probably in Hammerwatch.",

Overall I enjoy this game. There are several problems that stand out to me and I wanted to mention:  - The campaign maps aren't always straight forward. Several times we've cleared an area and forgot where we need to go. This causes you to walk a lot exploring for enemies. (That's usually what kills a co-op session with my wife) - The Paladin is a well rounded, powerful class. Had I known he unlocks a healing spell, my wife and I would be Paladin+Paladin instead of Paladin+Priest. - Although this is minor and very subjective... I'm not a fan of the money system for upgrades. I would have preferred a skill tree so I could see what I'm aiming for. Instead I looked up the skills on the wiki to create an upgrade plan. - Co-op is a requirement to fully enjoy this game.  Finally I'd like to address one comment I've seen in a couple other reviews. + Although the campaign is linear (not random or procedural), I've found that the replay-ability is fairly high because of both the diverse classes and the amount of secret areas in maps.",

I loved the playthrough on this class!  The game ramped up slowly and had quite a lot of mindless killing, but as I progressed through the dungeons, the difficulty curved up pretty significantly. By the last act I was on the edge of my seat, pulling off moves and combos that skyrocketed the fun level to great heights.  This is a *fantastic* game. If you can put up with some repetitive killing, you'll find that the levels, secrets, difficulty and visuals are all top notch and there is a TON of fun to be had for the price. Play on hard.

Hack and slash RPG with multiplayer support. This is exactly what I wanted when I was a teenager. If this had been released in the mid 90's it would have been the game of games. That said, it's not bad in 2014. In fact, it is great fun if you like old hack and slash games of Zelda-style. (not Zelda 2, obviously, this is top down) When I first tried this game the developers made an error, they had an external dependency for Mono requiring you to install that package in Ubuntu. This is not the way Steam games are supposed to work, Steam is supposed to be your repository for any special library requirements of the game. Since then the developers have fixed this issue and it now runs like any other game under Steam.

Those guys have done a great job to create a solid retro game, and they've got that even better than those old games they tried to reproduce. The bigger problem with old games were their dificulty, and they've solved this in Hammerwatch.   Put aside all the funny gameplay, challenging bosses, a quite original upgrading system, the well resolved HUD, simple controls and, the game is surprisingly well-balanced! It sometimes feel like Diablo (hit and run) but this fact doesn't make the game boring at all.  The only fail, I believe, is the art. It could be way better and more diverse.

Hammerwatch has a good graphic (part of the atmosphere), a solid gameplay, and you can play it in a group of 4 people as a local coop, but I can't recommend it for the campaign, all player have to be on one screen and in a group of 4 people it is impossible, because everyone wants to do something on it's own. But the general coop, via Internet so that every player has its own screen, is great.  The game has 3 different game modes with 3 different difficulties, one campaign, one hero-defense and one survival map. So far I only played the campaign and the hero-defense in medium. You can play the campaign solo but I recommend you play it with at least one friend. For the hero-defense I tried only one character of 5 and it didn’t work at all, with another character it might work alone, but I recommend the same as for the campaign.  I tried to play the game with keyboard + mouse and with controller, I can tell so far that the game is better to play with controller. 10/10",

            "review_text": "When it comes to a retro feel, something that reminds you of Diablo 2 or even Realm of The Mad Gods, Hammerwatch does exactly that. I followed this game from the Steam Greenlight forums and even tested the beta. From the beginning I knew that this was something I wanted to get my hands on once it came out.  The game takes place inside of Castle Hammerwatch, where your goal will be to travel from down the prison up to the royal chambers in the top and kill the evil dragon. You play as either a Paladin, Wizard, Warlock or Knight and each character has its own weapon and special ability.  Don’t be fooled, this is a serious game; and even on medium difficulty you will still have a hard time fighting through the numerous levels in each Act. The game is better played in multiplayer mode, but to be honest, good luck joining a game. For some reason I find it impossible to host a game, but I am able to join others, and this is when the game is best played.  Hammerwatch also offers a few perks, what they call “crutches” in the game if you choose to host your own single or multiplayer game. Different options allow you to make the game easier or a little harder. I suggest playing with the HP Regen and Infinite Lives crutch on when first playing, that way you can get a feel for what you’re about to be in for.  A game that is still in beta and continuously going through changes is sometimes hard to review, taking everything into consideration the game is awesome. Aside from the bunk multiplayer Hammerwatch is worth every penny. Constant battle action laced with power ups, secret passages and hidden doors makes Hammerwatch a soon to be classic and a necessity in any gamers library.

            "review_text": "The Good:  Hammerwatch inherits a lot of the fun of Gauntlet in that classic hack 'n slash style -- from ravenous swarms of (wo)man-eating eyeballs to the shambling eldritch fury of unholy liches, there're plenty of enemies to wallop, ignite, poison, and bullseye. With up to four player local co-op available, with mappable control sets for both keyboard and controller inputs, the game's extremely friendly and social to the game-loving crew that remembers the heydays of couch co-op. (You can play online, too -- no worries.) The visuals are simple, retro-ish, and can even be edited to make your screen look more like a standard def 16-bit game (if you're into that sort of thing).  For anyone concerned about how the game runs: it's smooth. You can turn down the settings significantly if your computer's not exactly top-of-the-line, and you'll likely do just fine. (My poor PC's been struggling for some time now to run too much of anything, but Hammerwatch doesn't hiccup on me once I cut back on some of the graphical bells and whistles.) The devs did a great job of giving the player a game that can be customized to fit a variety of play needs/experiences, and the ability to strip down the graphical demands to smooth out the game is one example of many.  The editor is great. Sprites are PNGs, their basic coding's XML, and the level editor itself is a pretty easy-to-learn GUI. There's some scripting involved for more advanced functions, but anyone who's experimented with modding in the past'll find a pretty simple, quick-to-get-into editor for the game. (In particular, cosmetic changes to the game are a snap.)  The Bad:  This game is fun, but there's just not a ton of it. You get a campaign with the game itself that'll take you through a handful of dungeons and bosses. They're not procedurally generated, so once you've played the game, you've played the game -- return trips are going to be much of the same. (Of course, you get four classes to experiment with, and three possible difficulty settings.) There's a survival mode that can add some fun to the game, but the lack of content sadly holds Hammerwatch back from having its real potential realized.  The community's doing what it can to add to the game -- like I said, the devs have put together a solid set of editing tools that can allow for plenty of ambitious modders to take the game the extra mile. However, that community's not a particularly big one. (I suppose this is a call to action, then: buy the game, and start making new campaigns for it! Something something about a rising tide lifting all boats...)  Also, the single-player's a little boring. It's not really the game's 'thing' -- it's a party-based game -- but you can wander the dungeons alone if you're into that sort of thing. You just might not have quite as much fun...  TL;DR:  Buy this game. Give it a playthrough with your friends. If you're really a mensch, build a campaign or make some cool sprites for the community. This game deserves more publicity and more people contributing to it content-wise. (And the devs deserve your coin.) It's got some draw-backs, but, in terms of fun-versus-price, you're going to get a good investment return out of it.",

I was very wrong about that- the bosses and regular minions are challenging and take a lot of strategy (mainly the bosses) and learning of their attack patterns to defeat (some bosses are downright impossible without teammates and change up their patterns a lot, but they're beatable alone once you find a strategy that works).   The skills for each class fit each class nicely and make each class play very, very differently, which is great for variety and the team aspect of the game. These skills allow you to grow you character as you see fit; you can do more damage, do that damage more often or upgrade/purchase unique skills, or buy skills that allow you to be more durable in different ways. These skills play to each class' particular strengths, and as a result, they are all pretty balanced, but there are also weaknesses that can be overcome with time or teammates. It's a simple setup and skill tree, and it works extremely well for character balance.  The music is nice, but I ended up turning it off in favor of my own playlist, but aside from that, there really are no discernable negatives to this game.   I think this game was made by gamers, for gamers, and incorporates a lot of good ideas into a very streamlined, good product.  Highly recommend.",

CONS: -It's pretty short since you can claw your way through the main campaign in 2-4 hours if you rush. And I think the expansion Sun Tower doesn't even need that if you know what you have to do. -The maps are always identical and only small differences in secret rooms differ from game to game. I don't know how hard it is, but a randomized dungeon system like in diablo could be better. ALthough the level design isn't that bad. -The Achievements Genocide and millionaire is a joke! Since you kill about 1-5 monsters a second it would need you at least 13hours just bashing through hordes of enemies... without any down time. If you play the game normaly 2-3 times you would get about 20%-30% done with both achievements so the developer thought it was a good idea to make you play the game 12 times? with just a handful of classes to choose from.  I know I ramble just about achievements but for a game with this small amount of content it is frustrating to hit a block. Thankfully there are a couple of guides and you can set up a 10monster/second trap of so you just have to let it sit for 4hours or so... -.- Or recycle the bonus level 4 250 times without saving after finishing.(btw: Xmas-secret-Achievement is still doable with the 1.3 beta version, although tedious). -Playing it alone is only fun the first time and after that maybe a second time with a different class until you learn it's specials. -I don't know if it's just me, but this 250MB Game always heated up my laptop(intel i3 CPU + Geforce 820M GPU) tremendously. And it bothers me very much. I gues the dev didn't take the time to optimize the performance but I would like that he did. Expecially in retro-styled games like this one. Although I admit that it is not nearly as bad as that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ The binding of Isaac... It still crashed on me a couple of times. But thankfully my saves weren't corrupted(as some of my friends').  PROS: -It is kinda funny to play in a group. Expecially if the other palyers aren't that experienced with gaming(since you could better play diablo or anything other). But here you could rush through the main game in an evening or so.  -The music ties in great into the action and at least for me didn't become boring although you hear it a long amount of time. -The leveldesign is kinda good the first time you play it. But it's sad that it's the same in every play through. -The classes are all kinda different and mostly fun to use. Although I never really tried the priest/cleric. -The price is ok. But I recommend to grab it in a sale, since it preatty small. My playtime is just as high because I lost my saves after nearly finishing both campaigns and because I got both grinding achievements which took my setup about half of my playtime.  So yeah, if you search for something 4 people could enjoy for a small amount of time together, grab it! It's better than I thought.  TIP: Make some backup saves from bonus levels or before the boss-rooms, so you could check stuff you might miss.",

I'd also like to mention I played through this game while high, you'd think that would make it more enjoyable but no, it doesn't.  Oh, and if youre expecting a challenge: don't. This game was stupid easy, at least on the normal difficulty. I can assume that the higher difficulties are nothing intuitive and are just enemies with more health/damage/speed or whatever, basically making the grind to finish this piece of ♥♥♥♥ game significantly longer and more frustrating than difficult. You are hardly punished for dying. You go back to a checkpoint and lose a life, wow, sounds punishing and roguelike right? Yea. Maybe if you couldnt buy lives, they're really cheap too. On the final boss I literally just bought us around 30 lives giving us around 45 and I just ran at the boss and spammed my lame wizard ♥♥♥♥ at some dragon balls or whatever, died, respawned, and did the exact same thing until the boss died, and I was doing most of the damage.  Expect to run around boring environments trying to find boring keys while fighting boring enemies all while literally destroying every wooden box and barrel around you for money that you use to buy boring upgrades, ultimately leading you to an underwhelming duke out with some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dragon that can easily be beaten by taking advantage of this games poor mechanics.

Tough enemies can take a minute to kill even if you're taking no damage and they pose no threat to you, making them more chore than threat, which only adds to the sense of tedium.  The difficulty is also extremely inconsistent. Some enemies plink away with 1 damage and easily avoided attacks, while more difficult to avoid attacks often take half your life bar or more.

'Hey,' I said, 'I'll go with the mage, so what if my health drops like a barrel over the falls. Worth it to hurl fireballs.' Then I was slapped upside the face with the knight, who has a sword and a charge attack, both of which do about as much damage as a gentle fart. Then I was stuck in a dungeon with some maggots. The gameplay then became repetitive, with both killing enemies and breaking barrels for coins becoming repetetive. Maybe this game gets better over time, but I prefer games that are just plainly good. Save your money for Rogue Legacy or something.",

The combat is satisfying and has a nice feel to it, while the levels are sprawling and labyrinthian with lots of secrets scattered about. I'm a fan of the detailed pixel art style and the soundtrack is fun and fits the game nicely. The keyboard controls felt way too clunky, but using a 360 pad instead made for a much smoother experience.  The big problem with the game is that after those first couple floors, I started to realize how tedious and repetitive everything was becoming. The basic structure boils down to going from room to room, running past enemies to aggro them and bunch them together, killing off these groups of enemies, then going to the next room and doing it all over again. New enemies are introduced along the way but they're essentially re-skinned versions of old ones. Room layouts also vary and there are the occasional traps that make planning your attacks more interesting, but other than that, there's so little difference between an encounter on the third floor and one on the tenth. The floors themselves are huge in size, which I like, but this can be a double-edged sword since they start to drag on after a while. There is some joy in taking down dozens/hundreds of enemies at once and racking up a huge combo, but that joy is almost entirely gone after doing it hundreds of times repeatedly.  I also wasn't a fan of the fact that in order to reach the legitimate ending, you'll need to collect 12 wooden planks along the way. There's never any suggestion that these planks were anything other than optional, so I never sought them out. And since you can't go back to previous floors after completing boss fights, once you miss them, they're gone. It felt like a cheap tactic and left me somewhat disappointed.  Hammerwatch has a few things going for it and some really nice ideas. Unfortunately, the monotony of fighting large hordes over and over in the same manner overshadows a lot of them. Instead of being a fun experience, it turns into a grind and stays that way until the end.",

The enemies were mostly just health bags that one has to chew through to progress, but it takes sooooo long sometimes, and when it does take that long it's just repetition of safety.  I don't feel compelled to mention much else about the game like the upgrades and secrets because the actual core gameplay is not up to par. Me and all 5 other people I played this with never got past like level 3 out of lack of interest. Let it be known we were all generally excited to play it, and then after a few hours in we all realized that that was the whole game.

A lot of elements are on the right place but it fails to give me an engaging experience, and the main reason for that is the lack of depth in the game.   You'll start playing the game with, for example, a wizard. So you'll start to walk around, shoot fireballs, collect coins and keys. And you'll keep doing that forever with very little variation. Very rarely you'll update your character to change some stats that you'll hardly notice. Enemies are all more or less the same thing. It's not very challenging, the few times I die was because I got bored and reckless. Your only concern is with what's on screen at the moment, which always require the exact same strategy, and occasionally backtracking.  From the top of my head, some things that could help this game out are management of resources, the good old levelling system, different abilities, (more) different enemies that require different strategies etc. There's a good reason these things keep showing up in games, they add a whole level of gameplay the player needs to be aware of, it adds a layer of complexity. The player is not only moving and shooting, he's always thinking about these other layers, and that influences how he plays the game. Too many moving parts and the game becomes overwhelming, too few and it lacks depth which is the case with hammerwatch.  On a side note, I only played the single player campaign and I'm starting to get the impression that the game was intended as a coop experience. This could explain the simplicity, as it makes the game more casual and easy to play with friends without any prior skill.",
