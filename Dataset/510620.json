Colorful minimalist graphics combine with an intense unnerving soundtrack, making for an exciting mix of art and arcade.",

            "review_text": "Might look like 21st century, but plays like 20th. Every death forces you to replay the last three levels, making the game a chore. You will end up playing the same stages over and over again before getting a few seconds of trying out a new strategy on the stage you are having problems with. If the developer cannot come up with something better to stretch the game's length or 'punish' the player for dying, this is just very lazy game design.",

            "review_text": "I had recieved this game in the October Humble Monthly Subscription, and I have to say, it's a fantastic game.  I like these kind of games that just drop you in and you need to figure you whats going on. A very challenging yet rewarding twin-stick shooter that introduces new concepts and challenges as the game goes on.  The art style is minimalistic yet visually pleasing, the haunting soundtrack keeps edging you to discover more (In this case, I ended up beating the whole main campaign in one sitting).  Best of all: It has co-op.  And there's even more wothwile content to play after beating the main game.  On a side note, this game really reminds me of 140, go check that out if you like this game.",

            "review_text": "Although I love all of the games Jeppe Carlsen has worked on, I must admit I was a tad bit skeptical about this being the 'anti-140' (140 being almost everything I love in a game). However this has been a pleasant surprise (not that I thought it'd be bad, really)! Spent quite a bit of time playing it with my brother, and we both love it!  Challenging would be an understatement. This game is pretty difficult. Maybe it's just me being bad at these kinds of games, but it can be pretty tedious to get through at times. Rewarding in the end though! If you like extremely challenging, quick paced, strategic games, then this is great.   The soundtrack is unnerving, visuals are charming, and although it takes a bit of getting used to, the controls are pretty comfortable. Amazing game so far! Lots of fun both single player and co-op.  (Edit: It isn't actually as hard as I had made it out to be. The reason it was so difficult was because I had it connected to our TV through HDMI so it lagged a bit. Definitely still challenging though.)",

            "review_text": "As the other reviews and the store page say, it's a very difficult twin stick shooter. Here are some important points about the game. 1: There are absolutely no instructions, settings, or anything to show you what to do. The only thing they imply is that you should avoid the cubes and the counter in the background shows how many levels are left.  2: You have to figure out the controls yourself (which is mostly fine since the controls are very simple).  3: There are checkpoints.  4: The game is rendered in 3D but you can only see it from the top, making it seem 2D. This can make the cubes be slightly more difficult to avoid than expected.  I would rate the game positive if it actually had instructions, settings, etc. There's no reason for a game not to have those, even if it's a simplistic or minimalistic game. The gameplay itself is extremely difficult, but fine as a game.",

Minimalism means being reliant on an impeccable grasp of your basic mechanics; placing checkpoints 15 levels apart means, having an unnavigable menu, and not including keyboard support (you MUST have a pad to play) are only a handful of the clear and obvious problems with this derivative and unambitious project. Yet another disappointing Humble Monthly selection.",
