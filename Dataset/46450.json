            "review_text": "Pros:  +Cliché moments and references to movies and games. +A lot of humor and adult references (if you know what I mean, wink wink). +Tactical RPG (similarity to those of Final Fantasy Tactics, XCOM, Silent Storm, etc.). +Bright and colorful – rather detailed on some locations with the general environment. +The storyline fits the game and does so perfectly with the supported humor and complaining from your fellow party members (humorous complaining – if that makes any sense). +Custom Keybinds. +Music fits nicely with the game. +Graphics in my opinion are okay. I believe they could have polished it up more, but it wasn’t bad where I would quit a game on graphics alone.    Cons:  -UI could use some polish. -Controls at times may feel wonky when moving the character at the same time when moving the camera (The game tries to pull you towards the hero when you’re trying to scout ahead of your movements). -A linear storyline -Not a lot of RPG elements (not a lot of spells, certain amount of armor/weapons, no manual stat gains – done automatically).    The game is supposed to be a fun, goofy experience about a hero that is to save the kingdom from an evil sect. Sounds like your typical storyline for a RPG, right? Well… it is! I believe you could call it a parody to other TRPGs out there and they’re doing it in their own fun way (which I approve). The bantering between certain party members and towards you is comical (I’ve had my outbursts of laughs, not going to lie).   The game isn’t to be taken seriously. If you are jumping into to this game and hoping for a serious TRPG, well, you might be disappointed and rant with a negative review on why this isn’t your cup of Joe. If you come in here knowing that this is a parody to other TRPGs, have a sense of humor, wanting to find humor in a title, then this game should fill your shoes.   The battles aren’t rememberable, but they do the job. At times you may even question the actions of your party members and throw a rant at your monitor, but that is perfectly normal. I’ve had my fair share with the ditzes and a directional figure. I’ve also had the occasional crash, but it didn’t happen till after a 5 hour or longer gameplay session; I’m assuming a very slow memory leak…? If you save often then this issue won’t be an issue – besides, who doesn’t save often on a RPG anyways?  Overall, this was a nice game to stumble onto and I find the humor and cliché moments very well done. I don’t see a lot of TRPGs and if you’re trying to find one yourself, I would recommend buying this one when you can!",

The only real complaint I would have is that with the total lack of any sidequests and the 100% linear nature of the storyline, there is about 0% replayability. Still a good game though.",

Point is, this game is an intriguing mix of humour and stylized cuteness. The hero is a depressed emo failure, Holy Avatar is a rock n roll demigod with shiny armour and jet black sunglasses. And your 'army' for want of a better word is primarily composed of women (they being the only ones to survive the initial assault). It's fun. It's witty. It's a dialogue heavy, tactic style RPG whose primary purpose is to make you lol. Success.",

It starts out with the main character being a emo who was the only one ever to fail at the commander achademy and attempt to sacrifice himself until a Paladin names the 'Holy Avatar' comes to your aid and inspires you to fight against the forces of darkness.  Like Deathspank, this game has tongue-in-cheek humour at fantasy styled RPGs and MMOs with some silly enemies that'll bring a smile to your face such as savage mushrooms and sabre-toothed bunnies. There are even green mushrooms that when killed you hear the maro 1hp trune play and even see a 1hp appear.  All character have unique abilities and you have to think tactically in order to fight back and cut down the enemy. A fun little game and good to have a little laugh at too.",

            "review_text": "Grotesque Tactics: Evil Heroes is a turn based 'strategy' game featuring specific characters, a linear storyline, and no random encounters. I love turn based strategy games (Cute ones like Disgaea, serious ones like X-Com, easy ones like Final Fantasy Tactics, and unforgiving ones like Jagged Alliance). I thought this one would be right up my alley. Here is why it wasn't.  The gameplay lacks real strategy. There isn't any units you control outside of what they issue you in the story. Each unit is unique in character, has semi-unique abilities (all three archers have little variation), and is limited to how they level up (limited, set number of possible encounters). Keeping low levels up to speed becomes exceedingly difficult as the stronger characters tend to have to bail out the weaker. The characters have unique abilities (similar to the Final Fantasy Limit Break system), but they tend to be counter-intuitive to how they are used. When the characters see enough action, their special ability happens automatically, which can affect both your enemy and friendlies the same way. If that wasn't frustrating enough, there are also neutral monsters that will sometimes attack your enemies for you. That sounds fun and exciting at first, but then you realize they only take away xp from your own units. Due to the lack of balance between weak and strong units, and the limited amount of xp to be gained, battlegrounds can turn in to a game of luck more than strategy.  The lack of camera controls, playable area (boundaries), and fixed (unchangable) game controls also make for frustration as well. They don't break the game entirely, but still will probably be noticed enough to slow down the flow of gameplay.  I would like to play a polished version of this game, with some random encounters added to train up my low characters, but that simply will never happen.",

But this game was so excruciatingly horrible that besides Steam review I wished Steam would allow us to remove games from our library. That's right, this game is so bad I wished I could remove it from my library rather than let people think I actually play this monstrosity.  Do not buy this game, warn others to not buy this game.
