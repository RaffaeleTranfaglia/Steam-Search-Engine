            "review_text": "Date of writing this review: 20/10/14. Some of my criticisms may have been addressed by the time you are reading this.  Firstly, I would like to state that I got this game 2 days ago, and I  already  have 16 hours. In my opinion, the game is the best tycoon game since Transport Tycoon Deluxe.  However, there are a few negatives that I would like to address, and because of these few negatives, people are not enjoying the game, or buying it.  - Dumb Name. Why didn't they call it Transport Fever!?! Would have made much more sense as the game is not only about building train lines.  - Minimal Tutorial. Despite this game being a very complex game, the tutorial is almost laughable. However, there are several community made tutorials to which aided me in learning the game, my favourite one being  this one  [dl.dropboxusercontent.com]   - Rail Building could do some work. In order to build railway, you must do it in several chunks. This is as the game tries to average out the terrain, so that the rail will not go on a gradient - which can cost an absurd amount of money if the rail goes for too long.  - No Airports, or Boats. The airports I can somewhat understand, however the boats I do not. Each map has a river along it. It is crazy to think that despite this, they didn't put in a chance to add boat lines! I do hope that they add these features into a future update, or even a DLC.   - Only 4 Resources. I understand that with this, they were trying to go for the simplistic approach so that the learning curve isn't to big, however at least give me a chance in a settings menu to have more. The game does have excellent modding support though, and so I am sure that people will make mods in order to address this issue.   Once you look over these issues, it can be seen that the game is amazing. All up I am going to give this game an 8/10, and would still reccomend you to buy it, despite these issues. Also, if they do fix up these key issues, it could easily be a 10/10. Enjoy the game, and should you have any further questions regarding the game, feel free to add me and ask me some questions!  (This is my first proper review, so could you leave me some feedback? Thanks guys!)",

If you are a fan of transportation simulators, I can only reccommend to give this game a try. It may not all be to everybody's taste, but any game with Zürich's doubledecker trains in it is a huge plus for me.  At the moment, we Beta ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ers can experience new features and improvements the nearer the release comes. So I expect a great experience on and after September 5th. And the devs are putting their heart into it, it's a labor of love.  If you are still unsure after my opinion and the other reviews, just check out the check lists, let's plays, live streams or reviews on the internet to get a better picture.  As everyone has different hopes and needs for their OOT-like experience. I for one, just wan't to build huge networks with trains I like.  Oh, did I mention it's very easy to mod? It is very easy! And the devs engourage it too! Expect tools sometime after the release.",

I am very encouraged that the developers are working to fix these things and believe that once the modders get to work this will be the foundation of the next generation of train/network games.

            "review_text": "Reccomended only for hardcore train lovers! Even then it's a reserved reccomendation.  I bought TF on sale, and am enjoying it somewhat. It reminds me quite a bit of Cities In Motion, in that it's using the same game engine, except you can't set prices and there are no victory conditions. Also there is no failure state that I've seen, so TF is technically a simulation and not a game at all.  I have played 175 hours in Sid Meier's Railroads, and loved it. That game has lots of strategy, and it's more about connecting the various types of cargo randomly scattered across the map for a huge profit. Great challenge to see how many points I could crank out in an hour of gameplay. But the track laying was pretty boring.  Now I'm looking at this game's cargo routes and scratching my head. Why the heck is it called Train Fever if the cargo routes are right next to eachother? Why do most of the mines not produce anything? Why can't I make a profit running rail cargo at all? Why is most of my time--and profit--all in road traffic, in this game about trains?  I can only reccomend this game to diehard train fanatics and railroad sim lovers, but even then it's lacking. So, buy on sale. Don't expect things in the game to work properly, like laying track over roads! OMG! Expect to tear your hair out.  But yes, the rail laying is good and the train scheduling and routing are good, better than 'Railroads' and more realistic. Just not as fun. More sandbox sim, less game.",

I loved Railroad Tycoon 3, but this game tops that in strategy, realism, and finances. 35$ is a bit steep for price in my opinion, so if you like train sims, wait until it goes on sale to buy.  There are no bugs in this game- I really don't know why other people keep complaining about bugs when I have experienced zero bugs in this game. Every 'bug' that people post here or on forums are usually built-in game mechanics (like slope errors, collision errors, train signals) that people just don't know how to fix because they are so used to sims being a plop and play kind of game with no real thinking involved. This game is a puzzle- you have to find the most efficient way to transport people or goods to make a profit, just like in real life. You also can't just sit on your lines and trains for 20 years and expect to still make money. As the world progresses, you need to keep up with the times and upgrade your system.  So if you like train sims and a real challenge get this game. Check your computer's specs before buying though- don't buys games without seeing if you computer can handle it!",

There is also a lot wrong, the UI is sparse and in some places unintuitive, there are more than a few bugs. and some features are really lacking.

With only 11 hours to go, I went ahead and bought it after watching the trailer and looking at the screenshots - it definetley looked like something I'd enjoy.  Loading the game took a little longer than I was comfortable with, and the menu music felt really dated and out-of-place. That was very quickly rectified by a short stop to the Options menu. Unfortunately, this game seems to suffer with load times - loading any save game (which are &gt;= 250MB each...) takes around three minutes; after loading in, there's some slight lag while the game builds up the environment.  Gameplay was surprisingly enjoyable. You have control of buses, trams and railways and need to connect up two or more towns and build a successful business. It can be hard at first, but once you've swept past the learning curve it all falls into place. Furthermore, the random terrain generation (seeds) makes each replay a unique experience in its own right.  It does have some other shortcomings, though. Terrain is annoying; if you make a mistake, you can't rectify it with the terrain tools if it's too close to a structure or river. I was left with two sheer cliffs after demolishing my railway bridge - I could not remove them.  Overall, I'd rate this game a hearty 8.5/10 - it's still got potential, but enough content to keep me interested until the next patches/DLC.",

            "review_text": "Definetely a big recommend!  The game is missing a big tutorial, it just starts with basic tutorials how to set up your first transportation line with automatically moving vehicles. However, it's all about transportation and getting money for it. So there is not much more you have to use, except your human logic.  So your transportation lines have to make sense. At first you have to check WHAT should be transported. For beginners, use trains and check out two companies that are close to each other.  Company 1: Produces oil and sells it on the market Company 2: Needs oil in order to produce goods  So, as you can imagine, in real life Company 1 would love to sell it's oil to Company 2 who absolutely needs it. BID AND ASK. All right, so just build two railway stations next to these companies, connect them. Create a new line in between these two railway stations, buy a train, tell it to drive according to the line you just created and thats it.  The companies will notice AUTOMATICALLY that there NOW is a possibility to sell/buy oil from each other. The AI in this came is intelligent enough to notice this advantage. So Company 1 now notices, that there is a way to transport and sell it's oil to Company 2 using your railway station. What does Company 1 do now? It starts stacking up the produced oil barrels on your railway station. Your train will arrive, pick up the barrels, drive to Company 2 who automatically buys it. After arriving at Company 2 you instantly get the money. That's pretty simple.  Now, for example, Company 2 takes Oil and produces GOODS. Villages and people living there need the goods. So what you can create a second transportation line between a nearby village and Company 2, in order to transport the produces goods to the village. Similar as in the example above, the companies/villages will notice this advantage and start ordering goods from Company 2 using your second line. Again you're earning money.  Now, as the village gets goods to develop, you can also start building a THIRD line. On the lower right side of the user interface you can open a menu. One of the points allows you to show the houses of villages in colored codes. After enabling this option, you will see blue, yellow and green houses.  Green houses = Houses where people live in Yellow houses = Stores and places for people to have fun (e.g. after work) Blue houses = Offices/workplaces for the people that work  If you zoom in you can see that people have to walk a LOT from their homes in order to go to work every morning. So what you can do is simply creating a THIRD line to allow the people to travel from home to work by bus. Again the AI is intelligent enough to notice this advantage, so they will immediately start using your busses and pay money for tickets.  Then, after more and more people work, your city gets more efficient. Companies grow and develop thanks to your lines transportating the workers, so after growing even MORE people can work there. Also the houses where families life in. The better the lines are set up, the more attractive the area in your city gets, leading to a rising population in your city. You really can see the city growing over time.  So a last example, after work the people may be exhausted, so they need to relax, maybe going to yellow houses and playgrounds in the city. so why don't create a fourth line that transports the people in between work/stores/their home? They will use it then again.  All you have to do in this game is thinking logically. The world is amazingly intelligent, it is fun to watch the city growing. Even companies grow if they notice that they can't produce enough products anymore in order to supply other companies. Every single move and line you create, every single bus stop, can change the peoples behavior and influence the way your city grows. This is fantastic.",

It's not always easy to get tracks right, you have to build it in short sections, and there is no way to design a track without actually paying for it. I've lost millions of in-game money by placing a track, only to find out at the last moment that something is unable to align.  I finally did manage to get a map working and see some nice action, only to notice the game performance collapsing in on itself. We've been discussing this issue a lot on the official forums, but until the developers fix it, i can't really give this game a recommendation to anyone else. When you got a lot of track on a big map and a lot of vehicles, the frame rate simply tumbles and at the end of every in-game month, while the game does some calculations, it will simply freeze for up to 30s. Enjoyable for shorter sessions, but in the long run the issues take the fun out of it.",

            "review_text": "I play this game since Beta and it is getting better and better. The developers listen to the community and already implemented a lot of wishes. If you played OTTD you should know, that this game is different in some aspects:  - The industry chains are smaller but production does not increase/decrease at random and it matters where you deliver the goods because cities will only accept a certain amount. - The scale of the game is different, you won't have a station with 10 tracks in each town in this game unless you are crazy. It is not like OTTD where you build 20 trains for one line, it focusses more on longer lines between cities. That said, you will most likely have less networks and less complex setups for station entrances and rail crossings because it is not so easy to build such things. - The terrain in this game really matters. In OTTD you can just terraform everything at some point and tracks can just go up the hill anywhere. Here it matters where you lay your tracks and you have to plan according to the contour lines.  If you can live with that, you get a really good game with:  - Great graphics - Already great mods (see  trainfever.net)  - Simulated people and goods - Simulated town growth - Great maps  So what issues do I have with the game: - If you build a lot of stuff, it takes time to autosave and sometimes the simulation slows down - Balancing of some trains and cars needs some work, TFV for example won't reach 300 km/h on most tracks because of weak acceleration (they changed the TFV but I couldn't test it since the changes) - Trains sometimes drive one after another because of long boarding times. This affects profit and line frequency (this has now been fixed)  -------------------------  Addition now that the US DLC is out:  Some of my concerns have been adressed: - Performance of the game is better, still a slight slowdown when autosave (but you can now choose how often the autosave is done) - Balancing is still not perfect but TFV is fixed - Boarding times are less of an issue   The US DLC works fine, I didn't see all the models yet. But there even seem to be options to enable all vehicles (Europe and US) and just play on a Europe or US map, which is great. I don't know if the balancing of the US vehicles is good because I am still in 1870. There are still some old bugs in the game but nothing game-breaking, mostly visual little annoying things like missing tunnel portals.  I tested some mods and there are awesome vehicles available. Unfortunately the old mods are broken but there is already a solution out (the community has a mod manager which will do all the work for you). If you do some research it is easy to find new vehicles or balance mods and add them to the game. With the new ingame tools you should then be able to really customize your experience, which is great!",

            "review_text": "Train Fever is an entertaining game, with a few flaws, but an overall enjoyable expierence.  In Train Fever you run a transprort company from the 19th to the 21st century, using buses, trams, and trains to make a profit shipping people and cargo. I liked how the game started in 1850 as comparable games such as Transport Tycoon, and Cities in Motion start way later, which certainly changes your stradegy in the early game. The simulation is easy to understand yet difficult to master. The Graphics are quite pleasing to the eye, and the soundtrack is pretty catchy compared to other sim games I have played. The game is challenging and there are many stradegies to try to make a profit. The Randomly generated maps are a great addition that diffinatly add replay value. ISometimes it is simply great to watch your trains race around the landscape. Basically this game is what Transport Tycoon could have been if it was made today in 3D.  However the game does have some issues. Track laying is very difficult. Rather than clinging to the landscape like you would expect it to, it is completely independant of it, meaning you will have a lot tracks raised and lowered around the ground. It is also finickey and will often give errors when it is clear there should not be one. The UI is not exactly Intuitive either. However it seems the devoloper is apt to fix these problems.  Overall I would recomend this game to any fan of Railroad Tycoon, Cities in Motion and especially Transport Tycoon, as it is a complex quality expierence.  ",

            "review_text": "Train Fever is a game I enjoy but needs more work. I followed this game for a while before release and Urban Games seems pretty committed to making this a good game so I have confidence in them.  So let's get the basics out of the way. On the one hand it's a pretty straight forward game. If you've played Cities in Motion or Tranportation Tycoon you won't be lost. The game looks pretty good even on my old computer and considering I'm using Vista it runs pretty smoothly.  One of the first problems and it may seem like a small one is that you can't make tracks that crossover each other. You can make switches or bridges, but if I have two tracks (an up and down line) and I want it to cross over and merge with another set of tracks I can't do that. I have to make an additional set of switches. I imagine that will be implimented eventually but it really annoys me because from how I play in games like OpenTTD I usually have one or two main lines with branch lines feeding it.  Another small thing that gets really annoying fast is that you can't build roads over track (unless you build a bridge). Again this will be a quick fix, but it will really started to make me mad when I was trying to upgrade my old lines to high speed tracks.  One thing is that trains are supposed to dynamically spread themselves out they don't stack up on each other, but it seems it has somes bugs. At first it worked fine, but as I got into the late game the system seems to break down so I'd always have three or more trains at one end of a three station line and the other had nothing. I actually watched this for a little bit to figure out why and I think what happens is that when you get into the late game and have trains with a 100+ passengers that it creates bottleneck with all those people loading and unloading.  I'm not convinced that cargo is really flushed out. I struggle to make cargo lines to make any kind of profit and really by the 20th century it's better to use trucks.  I think the building of roads and tracks needs work. Sometimes it's a crapshoot on what will work and what doesn't.  Still these all strike me as problems that are easy to fix and probably the devs are on it already. Train Fever seems like a pretty solid base to expand upon and Urban Games seems to have big plans and if an active modding community can get off the ground I see great things for the game. This game is really for people who really love transport tycoon games.  Edit: Well turns out the devs have fixed the problems in a way... they're releasing a sequel. Honestly I'm most excited about the ways they've improved track building and that you can laid road directly over track than the addition of ships and planes.  I'm reserving judgement on Transport Fever until I can see some let's plays and see the game play in action but it does look like they'll fix most of my problems. Still no multiplayer but maybe the third game will include that.",

            "review_text": "I have to say, this is a great tycoon game (It is not a simulation), because of the sounds of the locomotives, music is good to listen to.  This game isn't too distant from another game I enjoy, called Open TTD, but there are stuff I'd like to mention that I'd like which are:  Grid less terrain is a welcome change to what I'm used to. The 3D aspect of it makes you have to carefully choose where to put the lines, it also makes track and road laying realistic, including gradients.  Contour lines makes it easier to dictate slope steepness and greatly assist in designing a railway.  The procedural towns and cities are a welcome sight as it makes them fully dynamic  There are a couple of bad points that I'd like to mention though:  The game needs a great deal of polishing and optimisation as it runs poorly on my PC  Constructing railways I find, is difficult, you can't exactly plan the entire line in one go.  For example: I'd like a feature where you can place and move multiple 'sections' of track by moving their nodes, then placing stations and depots.  The design of stations are limited, what I was thinking was having something like Terminal platforms.  Also, I'd like to be able to choose where the building goes as the building dictates where the road joins onto it, then choose the location of the platforms seperately from it, possibly include bus station / stop facilities which are connected to the station instead of having it as an afterthought.  What about the platforms themselves? The platforms don't have to be built straight, they aren't modular either, they also aren't built to a specific length.  There's also no mention on how stations are upgraded if the trains get too long.  Other then that...?  Well, there is the lack of vehicle spacing in the game.  There's the odd 'feature' in the game, where you can load both cargo slots in a wagon, effectively making the said wagon carry twice as much compared to making it carry a single cargo (for example: an open wagon can carry 4 items of coal, as well as another 4 items of iron ore, together the wagon carries 8 items, where if you're hauling a single type of cargo, you carry a maximum of 4 items).  I'd like to see this gone, you can only haul a total amount of cargo instead of a maximum for that particular type of cargo.  Why are the loads measured in items? How do you define an 'item' of cargo?  For example: Goods, How do you define an item of goods? Size of the item? Weight of the item?  Or perhaps a lump of coal? in which case, an open wagon carries 4 lumps of coal.  Or perhaps more lucrative would be items of oil? a wagon can carry 10 items of oil?  It doesn't really make much sense in those terms.  I'd prefer terms we can relate to, such as the Cubic metre to define capacity of anything or metric tonne to define weight.  Or perhaps represent it as a percentage rather then items... After all a percentage does make a lot more sense then that since it is expressed as a ratio compared to a figure.  It would be nice to have a more in-depth tutorial about how to make services between cities and industries compared to how to make the said link between them.  The 'cargo display' doesn't really help all that much, it should show links between industries as either a straight line or a line along the roads compared to icons.  I also find the cargo icons confusing as I can't distinguish what industries have the appropriate icon.  You also can't connect just any two industries together, the industries 'pair' themselves up with another industry which the link isn't easy to change, this problem is a type of game breaker for me.  There also isn't that much pressure forcing you to actually have trains in the first place as it's perfectly fine having roads deliver loads along with trains, You could make an entire network formed up of trucks and buses if you wanted to and still come out with a profit, completely defeating the name of the game altogether.  It's not the best transportation game out there (I still prefer the Transport Tycoon game play over train fever's), but it's a good to play every now and again.",

I have, at this time, 88h in the game, and i dont regret one single hour.  This game, as it is, is a fresh feeling game for me. I tried a lot of games, i played a lot of games, and this game feels fresh and accesable to everyone from beginner to veteran.  At this point, the game is very well playable and even after you know the drill of how to run your company, every game you start, feels different and gives you different options.  In my Opinion this game is, atleast for the late game part, for people who got no problem with putting a lot of time into it to get that perect train connection, that perfect busline and so on.  Of course, as it is with new games, it has some trouble to get through. For me, the most remarkable problem is the late game lag. I dont know if its just for me and my computer, but the Lag in the Late Game ( eg. Big Cities, lots of stuff going on ) gets annoying at time. There are some Bugs, but its nothing that would destroy your gaming experience, for example dont let you do certain things.  I just want to note here, that the modding community does fantastic work and the devs are, at this point, working closely with the community and let them create stuff for the game, that they can then release in future updates and gives the devs more time, for vrious other improved.  So, to sum it up, if you like a solid Tycoon game, that does nothing special, but what it does pretty decent, you like trains etc., you wont regret this game.",

But, the developer is stepping up, fixing bugs, adding features and actually listening to the community in what they want to see in the game and trying to make it happen.

Just let us demolish everything. - Can't demolish a side track of a crossing without demolishing the whole train crossing and after that you have to connect the railroads again.  - Train turns at the same track instead of driving in a circle to turn and go the opposite way so I made a whole track for nothing.. - It would also be great if you can use more different trains at once couse i do not get a trainfever from 5 or 6 trains, that's to limmited.

Personally i think this game has some of the best train models i have seen in a game that isn't strictly developed as such (Train Simulator). If i could add anything to this game outside of the cargo situation being fixed would be to add A.I. competition as playing by yourself will only keep you entertained for so long.

Short description: Quite like Transport Tycoon, but better graphics and better gameplay. For guys who know Simutrans, Train Fever is the a little less complicated, but easier and graphically more enjoyable alternative. It's basically a complex 3D transport simulation game, where you can build and expand (reinvesting your revenue) your own transport network across about 100 Years in a random generated map.  Positive: + Easy to learn, so it's also easy to build your own transport-worlds full of marvelous train lines, for goods or passengers. + Best graphics for a Transport Tycoon I've seen so far.. Really great for rail-fans, thanks! + Enjoyable from the 1 hour to the 200 hour of gameplay (and further, if the developers continue imporving the game). + You can and have to really build everything along the railway line, so stations, slopes, bridges, tunnels, everything has to be done by you. You can build everything exactly as you want it (if you earned the money). Still (especially compared to other such simulations) it's easy to learn and sooo much fun! + The train and tram models (mostly swiss) you can choose from are gorgeous!  Negative: - Some bugs are still in the game (eg. occasionally building tools do weird stuff), but most of the severe bugs have been repaired quickly. The developers are quite active. - The user interface is not very nicely designed, but you'll get used to that after 10 mins. - Only trains, trams and buses so far (no ships, planes, underground trains, cable cars).. - Not many train models to choose from yet, but the ones they have are very well modeled! - No DLCs yet, but the still small community is quite alive. - You can not drive the trains in your world. But the graphics from looking at them should already warm the heart of any train-fan. - Passenger behaviour is not yet as complex as in Simutrans Experimental, so sometimes it's not 100% realistic... But for most purposes it works even better than most other transport simulations. - Only stations with up to 5 tracks and no underground stations or big city infrastructures available yet. So in its current form it's more like a transport simulator for rural railway networks, not megacities yet.  Conclusion: It's great fun for railway fans! With Train Fever I can finally my own beautiful alpine railway landscapes - and gampeplay is really fun... I love it. Buy it..",

It has some clear limitations, but for a casual sim fan it was easy to lose many(!) hours watching the trains and busses go 'round.  It follows the template of Railroad Tycoon or TTD, so you'll be moving people or 5 different goods between cities and factories via rail, tram, or bus/truck. As you improve transport around the map, towns will grow, creating ever-increasing volumes of traffic.  There's no stock market, ticket prices, or AI competitors - you just need to provide better transport for each resource (people and goods are individually tracked and can walk/drive a fair distance on their own to fulfill their needs).  Even the smallest map is quite large, so rail will be a big focus. The most fun is to be had in laying track and getting your switching (though essentially just 1 type of signal) set up. Then you watch you (increasing terribly expensive) trains do their dance. As time progresses different types of vehicles become available, and you will need to work to find the right balance of routes, transport types, and number of vehicles to make a profit.  The art, landscape, and animations are nice but nothing exemplary, and while there seem to be a good number of vehicle models, at any given time there's not a lot of variety (especially early game, where you will probably spend your first 10 hours or so). Variety is probably the biggest problem, as new industries don't seem to appear, there are no dynamic events/disasters/crashes, the routing logic is very basic, and there are no advanced track features (e.g. multi-switch sections).  That said, there are some smart, modern touches to the interface that you will really appreciate (except no undo...) like being able to sort to visible routes, auto-healing routes, combining stops, and easily visualizing individual lines. If the developers continue to expand the content, this could become great game. As it is, I can still wholly recommend it to anyone looking for some light transport strategy.",

Use the Traffic Giant method by showing through colors where people work. Now only a 'Land Use' map is available, but it doesn't mean people actually work next door (why have a transportation simulator otherwise). - No minimap in the game, a big shortcoming with the huge maps. - When you have many lines, it becomes very hard to distinguish where lines are headed on different tracks, especially when you are colorblind. Would be better if you could highlight certain lines more clearly. - Very few vehicles available in the game, although modders are working to change that - You can construct railway crossings over roads, but not the other way around, which is SUPER ANNOYING - Only straight railway stations? Really??  - Upgrading railway stations is incredibly annoying - Depots are one way only, which is terrible in case you have to replace a train in late game. Drive through depots are more realistic, and much better. - For some weird reasons,you cannot construct 'X' crossovers for rails, only Y mergers, which is very annoying when you merge a lot of rails. 'X' crossovers are part of elemental train track design, and leaving it out is completely random and not well thought out. - They should have made it easier to make flyovers. Making realistic flyovers is very hard due to the way the bridge pillars are implemented. Tunnels should be easier to make, too. - No way to customize the paint schemes of the trains. Devs say this is for reaslisms sake (while oddly not incorporating any realistic logos), however in real life, trains have been in different color schemes all the time in different decades (e.g. german trains) or special schemes. The trains are also a random collection of german/swiss/austrian trains, which makes the lack of paint schemes even more weird and unrealistic.  It just seems to me that the devs didn't really think it through that much. However, despite these shortcomings, it is still a great game to play. Lets hope that the mods or devs will alleviate these weird shortcomings soon. Some pros:  - It looks great - Trains are nice (especially steam trains!) - Runs smoothly for me so far (Retina Macbook Pro, with nVidia card, with Bootcamp), no crashes or bugs to speak of - Give it a few weeks/months when some mods have arrived, and it will be even more awesome.",

It's perfectly straight and there's plenty of room to do it!'  But then...  NOPE. Can't do it. Nope, nope, nope, the terrain editor will find it absolutely UNACCEPTABLE and you can't build it. Never mind that the approaches look fine, everything looks fine, and argh, I just give up.  Want to build a nice, compact rail overpass that *doesn't* require pillars?

That's pretty much what this game offers, but only at a very shallow level. I'm sad to say it didn't live up to my expectations at all.   As a train set it is extremely limited in what you can do and requires extensive time to unlock any eras or vehicles at all to play with. There is no competitive element. So, just what is compelling here?  Most of it felt to me very incomplete and broken, with very poor feedback on what systems are doing under the hood and therefore little way to make sense of its failings. Often things just won't work for no reason. It's hard for me to rationalize why this game can't measure up in a fairly dead / abandoned genre, as it seems to have plenty of good ideas and then nothing at all to hold them together. If this were an early access alpha I would call it promising.   Instead I'm surprised that this game came out last year and it still hasn't been patched so that track and road laying were not so cumbersome, limited, and fails so often. I can't think of any problems mentioned in Rock Paper Shotgun's review that have actually been taken care of, and it's been a long time and many patches since so just what is happening here where a game is released with serious, unintentional flaws and just keeps them?  You'd be better off with Sid Meier's Railroads! or for a single-player transport tycoon experience maybe Cities in Motion 2. This game just feels extremely unfinished and I feel really betrayed that they made me pay 35$ for it. You'd think a 65% user rating would mean something but the rating system has really failed here. I don't know what people are expecting, thign thing is probably way better than Cities XXL and some shovelware tycoon game, but compare it to games that came out in 2006 and it's a real disappointment.",

I run Skyrim at full settings, X Rebirth at full settings, Crysis 3 at full settings. and all of them are high end graphical miracles that emerse you into new and amazing worlds. Train Fever although fun looking does not even come close to delivering this experience. Its a map with roads and rails crossing over them. You dont even get a 'ride / follow the train' view.   How can a simplistic looking map game harsh my system so bad?  Clearly there is something wrong with the game. And I will NOT tinker with my system to make this game work at the risk of making my computer unable to run the other games.

I think my big issue with Train Fever is that it is just not quantitatively fun. It feels like you are wrestling with the track editor in order to build anything. The challenge isn't identifying where to lay track in order to maximize a profit, but simply in building the infrastructure. A prospect like building a junction between two pairs of lines is almost nightmarish in complexity and difficulty to execute.  I've concluded that the developers are huge fans of trains, to the expense of actual gameplay. Things like the actual trains are rendered impressively well, with little things like the coupling rods on the wheels working perfectly. Unfortunately, trains won't route to spread load between multiple lines on a station. You can't lay road across railway lines - it has to be the other way around. You can't do something as simple as have an intersection between two lines without them connecting.  The game also lacks anything in the way of charm. The music is not particularly good, and gets repetitive very quickly. The cities and industries feel very lifeless. I compare it to the (admittedly flawed) Railroad Tycoon 4 which used music and graphics to evoke the nostalgia of steam era trains.  Could it still become a good game? Possibly, but I doubt it. It feels like it should be in early access, and it feels unfinished. It feels like effort was put into the game, but that gameplay is secondary to just making cool looking trains.  Should it be at the $30 price point? Not at this stage.",

Give me back my money and I will pay for it when you deliver!!!!!!  A tutorial now pops up and has been hastily added due to the large amount of complaints. It shows you how to build a bus line and a train line. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  This game has alot of missing content and features. I keep getting fobbed off in the forums by fanboi's saying what missing features.. everything promised is included in the game. Well I consider not being able to build a train track over a road a groundbreaking feature. Not having crossover tracks really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. A new feature added prevents you from removing roads in pre built cities which can really screw you transport options up late game when upgrading roads. There are still alot of issues and faults.   The biggest annoyance of all is they are making new DLC before addressing any of this bull****.",

The challenge comes with keeping routes profitable and building lines that can cope with the geography and topology. I bought the game at discount so I think it was value for money. Graphics and game speed are fine with the right kit. What is good about the game? Graphics, definitely - excellent detail. Addiction level is fairly high. Dealing with the terrain is absorbing. What could be better? Scenarios and game goals needed. Vehicles need drivers - it looks weird seeing driverless wagons and buses! Overall, a good mix of strategy and addiction. Worth it at discount so put on your wish list.",

But now, my freaking god just go where I want you to go and why isnt there any explanations about signals. Eventaully I got past that. I tried to NOT mess up, and made a loop that had one way, with *sigh* switch tracks. It didnt work out. then, I reloaded my game, hoping to get better. I connect one city to another, going slow. I also had this massive oil making industry, which was lucky for me. I kept expaneding, and eventaully I made it past 50 mil. By then, I had one hub station connected to other two cites. Now, Im 150 mil, in the 1900s. Sadly, passengers arent as good as they used to be. Becuase, *sigh* automobiles. The worst invention in this game. They just suck you dry. but 100 km / hr is a good speed, and cars cant compete with that. So yeah. Pretty wacky game. Overall, its a good game. A little while ago, I didnt see any changes. Back then I wasnt good enough to get far enough.",
