Yes, I do indeed recommend this.  (Disclosure: I acquired this visual novel by preordering it during (though not directly through) its Kickstarter, at near full price.)",

The plot takes you through the journey of multiple characters, starting in the homeland 'Rughzenhaide' which is currently being attacked. You follow Princess Selphine and her Guardian Ritona escape via the equivalent of teleportation into an unknown land on the other-side of the world.  I personally have only played through 3-4 visual novels, fault - milestone one stands out by far. The journey will keep you in suspense, filled with emotions and you just won't want to stop reading. The characters you encounter all have different personalities which keep you riveted into the story. An encyclopedia is also included in the game which you can refer to at anytime through the pause menu as there are lot of the terms used may be unfamiliar to you so I found this very practical. Pointing out also how stunning the artwork and animations were with the intricate detail that was put into them. Throughout the game the soundtrack felt quite repetitive and there were a couple of minor grammar mistakes in the English translation but other than that, the game to me is a masterpiece that will never be forgotten. Fault - milestone one tugged at my heart all the way through, a beautiful game indeed.  Now onwards to begin fault - milestone two!",

Please continue reading if you are interested in my opinion!    The Bad   When you first play the game you will be met with information overload as the game tried to feed tons of lore and background story in a relatively short amount of time. This can be quite overwhelming, but rest assured that you will learn which and what in details as the game gradually progresses. Based on the general consensus it has seemed like a lot of players agrees that the font of the game is pretty unsatisfying to look at. In my opinion, it doesn't bother me at all, but it would be nice if we were to get an option to change it.    The Good   My favorite part of any review, Let's talks about what the game got right! I came into this game not knowing what to expect and what I received was a beautiful tale that relentlessly tugs on my heart string in every right way from beginning to end. Fault milestone one is a story about acceptance, loyalty, family, hardship, and humanity. This game has a powerful message, and it's one that I will forever remember and be thankful. This is truly a beautiful game and I cannot wait for the release of fault milestone two!  Let's vote this game for a Steam award. I nominate this game to be the 'I'm Not Crying, There's Something In My Eye' award. This classic is a hidden gem and it needs to win something!",

This i ment to be a review for Fault milestone one, which is a fair mix of Fantasy and Science fiction? [At least People within the VN would call it Science-Fiction..., wouldn't they?]  'Btw: My Opinion in general is based on milestone one + milestone two'  I found this to be a truly amazing display of story-writing. Even if it is not Voice-acted the music fits. The style of art leaves no room for further wishes and I loved the turn of events when it came to the actual plot about Rune/Sarah's background. The story is marvelous... [I think 95% of the readers would agree]  In my opinion the explanations given on 'Manakravte', yeah that's actually the term for it, were great, maybe because i'm a fan of these kind of things^^  If you've taken interest in this particular V.Novel you should definetly check out the second part afterwards, as it continues the story [it kind of ends with a cliffhanger] right on the spot.  I'd like to take a short note on the heavy improvement they did in milestone two (as one may consider buying it) It's still unvoiced (Q.Q) but, they added animated CG-Events and extended the usage of explanations related to 'Manakravte', I feel like I could use it myself any instant :P.  All in all, they really did a great job developing such a fascinating, compelling story and I'm seeing forward reading the next part of this wonderful VN.  In the end, there's only one thing left to say,... excuse me for any grammatical mistakes, as english isn't my native language :D",

It doesn't offer anything in terms of choosing what path you take, but the story more than makes up for it. And anyway, it's a visual novel. There aren't choices in regular books anyway so it doesn't make a difference. I still enjoyed the story and went through the entire thing in one day. It's a few hours but it felt like 8 instead of a mere 4. Part one is definitely a buy if you want a compelling, sometimes dark, and heartfelt story.",

            "review_text": "Fault milestone one is an interesting introduction to the Fault series. Originally released in Japanese in 2013, the game was translated and released by Sekai Project in 2014.  Positives: - Amazing art and widescreen resolution creates breathtaking CGs and intense scenes. Character sprites are of equally high quality. - Compelling world building gives potential for the future chapters. A mix of science and magic promises interesting future developments. The characters are quite diverse and have interesting dynamics between each other. - Sleek and clean UI which includes features such as switching language during reading. The Gallery page is very well handled.  Negatives: - Funimation dub-esque translation leaves much to be desired. It is an adequate story in English, but personally it hurts me a little to read lines that are written awkwardly to tiptoe around stuff like honorifics and differing dialects. The decision to keep both English and Japanese probably made it harder to 'naturalize' translation, since the scenes could not have been edited to make them flow better when translated. - Somewhat clunky storytelling, with the overarching storyline abruptly coming in after the main story of this episode. As an episodic series, this is inevitable, and definitely a turnoff to some readers. - No voices, which does not help the awkwardness of the translation. The original was not released with voices either.   Overall, fault milestone one is still a solid fantasy VN and one of the prettiest I've ever read available on the Steam store. I'm looking forward to seeing what the future installments of the series have in store.",

The story is quite unpredictable and isn't really anything like you might expect from just reading the Steam store description. The characters are likeable, it's an interesting universe and the plot is solid. In the first chapter, it can be a little bit technical describing the various types of mana in the universe, but it really sets the stage for what is to come. I cannot write too much without giving away plot so I'll keep it brief. What makes Fault M1 stand out is the fact that it is not overly depressing nor is it merely superficial and overly sweet. A lot of VNs tend to be very depressing which is fine sometimes, but not really something I seek out. If I want to read something depressing, I'll read some Hemingway. Instead, Fault manages to convey an interesting universe with just the right balance of whimsy, fun, emotion and seriousness. In all, a masterpiece. The ending is a bit of a cliffhanger, but you'll be glad you read it and anxious for the next milestone. Highly recommended if you enjoy VNs!",

            "review_text": "==UPDATED==  I decide to update the review or perhaps fully rewrite it all from the beginning.  ========================================== Story : 9/10 ========================================== Fault Milestone one is a visual novel that present an interesting world and story to the reader, we will be following the adventure of Selphine Rughzenhaide and her royal guard, Ritona Reighnvhasta, trying to get back to their (destroyed) empire after having an unexpected problem during teleportation, they teleported to unknown land but after little investigation they found themself teleported to the other side of the planet (Land of Science, our character live in Land of Magic).  During their travel, they meet with several unique character, one of them will be joining the travel at the late game, it's about adventure and friendship.......... but don't you ever think that this visual novel is about adventure and friendship, there's a twist that going to turn this visual novel into one of hell a f*cked up story, it become 'race against time' and 'friendship or life'. The world in this Visual Novel is really interesting, The world is divided into two, Place where people believe in Science and People that believe in Magic(It almost like Western and Eastern). Our character is from Magic World and they teleported to Sceience World, there's a lot of the scene revolve in Culture Shock Topic and many of the conversation is about difference between science and magic socienty.  Character : 8/10 ========================================== Character in this Visual Novel is interesting and Likeable, every character is developed really well and they always have something unexpected that we cannot predict (like the ending where Selphine is..... ah spoiler :^) ) Just be prepared for mind blowing reveal about the character. the only bad part in fault is not all introduced character is presented in the story especially the antagonist, the one who invade the castle at the prologue *Melano best grill  ========================================== Art/Grapich : 10/10 ========================================== Stunning and Beautiful, the UI is minimalist but it doesn't mean it's bad, in fact, it's really good and fit the game. Character design is really good, Charaters sprites and CG is drawn pretty well (oh~ waifus!!!). This Visual Novel use unique 3D Camera system for immersive reading experience, to be honest it's not really immersive but it does give interesting reading experience and give more cinematic feel to the novel.  ========================================== Music/Sound : 10/10 ========================================== 4 words : Absolutely.beautiful.worth.buy It just f*ckin good to listen. too bad the game is not voiced (yes, it's not voiced)  ========================================== Enjoyment : 10/10 ========================================== I really enjoy this visual novel, honestly i'm not fans of fantasy genre but this one is exception for me because the story is really good. Well, maybe this Visual Novel is fulfill my need for fanfic about fantasy and sci-fi world.   ========================================== CONCLUSION ========================================== I recommended this Visual Novel, especially.... when you're into To Aru series (Index/Railgun), the premise is little bit similar except the time setting is different (To Aru = Modern Age, fault = Medieval age, or Late Medieval). Story : Check Twist : Check Music : Check Art : Check Character : Check Enjoyment : Check What are you waiting for, READ IT!! Also, don't forget to grab the sequel because the ending is so f*cking horrible that i really like it and wanted to read the second game right away. Pardon my english, it's not my first language but what important from this review is the score and i recommended it *Melano best girl",

Firstly, the story. The story is brilliant. Especially for an original piece of work some might even call it spectacular, but I struggle to use that word seriously. The story is about a princess and her guardian as they have fled their home and war using a temperamental magic. Using this magic they find themselves not where they expected and in completely unfamiliar territory. Before they get home they need answers as to where they are and how to get home but as they dig for the answers, they dig a bit deep into a mystery of the town and find themselves in serious danger. Before they leave, they need to solve problems that threaten who they find themselves caring about all while in serious danger themselves.  The characters are nicely fleshed out, and each have a non-stereotpical personality however, you may be able to pick out the inspiriations for these characters which may take away from the experience for you. I instantly recognized the story of one character in particular but it didn't stop me from liking them.  The artwork in this game is pretty damn good and it isn't all about  dem girls  even if pretty much all of the cast are female. Combined with the good soundtrack there is a pretty nice atmospheric feel to it.  All in all, this visual novel is a fantastic start to the fault series and a great entry into visual novels in general if this would be your first one.",

The writing and music is new and intoxicating, driving you through turns of tragedy, hope, darkness and light.  I love that the story allows you to potentially feel and understand all the characters rather than just the main ones. The question of morals, ethics, compassion and the 'what what you do' scenarios keep you reading.

The plot displayed the author's general understanding in politics and economics, which added to the depth of the game. FM's story is a mixture of sci-fi and fantasy elements. It is quite straightforward and easy to understand, even though there is a great deal of elaborations. There is hardly any surprise and the characters' development is typical for this genre (Each one has an intriguing background and his/her own moral question to answer) (or it is just me since I read too many manga of this type). But by and large, the game is very versatile and players are given room to interpret it in a deeper way or enjoy a heart-warming story of two girls traveling across continents.  TECHNICALITY: The art is extremely lovely/gorgeous (especially the title screen &lt;3!!), and the music is excellent, although I do find female characters to be drawn much more charming and distinguished than their male counterpart (I find all the male characters very un-cute D:.) The game UI is neat and elegant, and the translation is eloquent. Apart from a very small bug that made all the text of the bottom panel buttons Japanese for the whole length of my first run (it changed to English after I changed the setting to Japanese and switched back again), I have had no technical problem with FM.

In particular, the mature bits are not, to me, handled responsibly or even interestingly. Regarding Rune, I felt that much of the 'true story' was mostly shock value with little substance or consideration. I kept waiting and waiting for the great writing to come into play, but sadly it never came.   The characters are not very well fleshed out or interesting, and the music is fairly average.

A perspective jumps from person to person sometimes making it hard to know who we are supposed to follow. The situation is especially bad in a part where they supposed to read each others mind but the magic lets them to keep certain thoughts to themselves. Let the chaos begin!  The dialogs are a bit awkward and the character developments are happening suddenly out of the blue. A certain brother is especially guilty in this last regard. The characters themselves are ok most of the times except they seem to have a habit of acting stupid. (I mostly have issues with a certain father's idea of not letting his son to be lonely. Seriously... wtf?) I have to give points to the writing in regard of the two flashbacks though. That two flashback really is well written perhaps because they are told from only one perspective instead of several at the same time making them much easier to follow.  The graphics and the sounds are mostly ok. However this game really needs a feature that allows me to color the lines of every character differently. Focusing on the story sometimes I didn't notice that a different character started speaking. Especially visible with a certain company's secondary bosses. I don't even know which sprite supposed to belong to which name!  The game contains only one choice which doesn't absolutely nothing making it totally useless.  However, I would still recommend this visual novel it weren't for it's price. it's 15 euros so yeah it's cheaper than most visual novels but: 1: I'm not a fast reader and English is not my first language but I managed to read it in seven hours! There are games that not this long but they have gameplay. 2: Even worse this game ends with a cliffhanger! Excuse me but would it be so hard to get a somewhat satisfying ending by finishing the story ten lines earlier? 3: This game was funded on kickstarter. Which is good really but it means that translation costs were covered before the release. So how came it's in the same price category as some other not kickstarter founded Visual Novels?  If you really want to play this Visual Novel I won't stop you because in the end it's still entertaining. However, I suggest waiting for a discount because this game no way in hell worth 15 euros.",

From the description and the demo I went into this story thinking it was going to to be all about Selphine and Ritona, I was wrong.They take a back seat in this chapter of the story because it is really all about a third character called Rune and a mystery that surrounds her.  I was initially a bit disappointed that there was not enough about Selphine and Ritona making their way home. But the absolutely gripping mystery here is well worth putting that part of the story aside for this part of the series.",

Fault is a series of kinetic visual novels, meaning there are no choices or routes to go down unlike a dating sim. It's short, it's not as flashy or as big-budget as some of the VNs being released on steam these days. But you know what it does have? Good art, good music, great storytelling and atmosphere. I read through this and fault milestone one over a few weeks, and I'm very impressed by it.   If you love visual novels do yourself a favor. Heck, even if visual novel's aren't normally your thing this one is told uniquely enough that even someone who's not a fan of the genre could enjoy it.  Two thumbs way up, Fault Milestone",

The beginning is quite slow paced, so the first time I began to read I was already bored after 10 minutes. It didn't make any sense to me, and didn't really get to the point until later. Until the girls teleported to a whole different continent it was quite a puzzle to me.  But damn. After that, I just couldn't stop reading this. It had a great story. Not described in the info-box though, a little bit misleading. If you like some mystery and a good read, this is for you.  It's a bit crazy though, but it's still good.  The only thing I didn't really like is that when it was getting to the plot (returning to their homeland, and all the questions about how they stranded there) it ended. IT ENDED.   This really felt like an introduction of how great the writers are, and the real plot will be starting in Fault Milestone Two.  So yeah I have no idea how it will go in the next visual novel, but this one was great. Plot twists ftw, kind of.  I recommend this to you if you like a great read, and it's just clicking, no choices to make (only 1 lmao, wasn't even an important one).   8/10 for me :)",

Don't worry, I won't spoil anything. (Even the stuff in spoiler tags is arguable whether they're spoilers.)  (In fact, if you're still worried about it, just get the demo for this VN already and play it. This entire review isn't really necessary if you just check out the demo.)  I want to note just one thing: the description of Undertale. 'A game where no one has to die'.   Except, unsurprisingly, there are just a few characters where this seems to be impossible. Well, afterall, death is a part of life. You can't save an old man from his age, for example.   It's poignant because no matter what you do, how hard you try, it's just not part of the game, so whacha gonna do, right? Among such characters, there's one character I've been obsessing over. One I've really felt for and connected with, yet nobody else seems to care about. Maybe it's because, rare enough for most, I've experienced depression, strong enough to feel that level of hatred, that some people may not empathize with.  This game saves that character. I felt like this game saved me.  As the top review states. This is a peaceful magical country attacked by rebels or something. The princess and her friend/bodyguard escape by teleporting away. Instead of their intended location, they fall into a place with no magic, just technology. When they're completely lost there, they find an awkward, but friendly girl who wants to help them. Rune... (Oh, and if you didn't yet, maybe watch that trailer video up there.)  If you're still unsure... Get the demo! Please.",

The opening of the VN does little for story but tries to catch the reader up on worldbuilding which is nice in the realm of context, but can come of as a bit heavy handed. Also, the VN suffers from a lack of distinction when presenting characters thoughs which can be especially confusing when switching between characters rapidly within a scene. This VN is also not standalone in story, hence fault milestone  one . Still, the meat of the story presented is a thrilling one and not for the faint of heart. It's deep and disturbing at times (though not disturbing as some other VNs out there) but I appreciate the devs/writers not shying away from the content the stroy tackles.  Oh, and by the way, this is a Kinetic Novel. For those who don't know, that means it presents the story to the reader rather than having the reader make choices to define which story they get.",
