    "description": "Hordes of Zombies have taken over the world. Your mission is simple, destroy all zombies and save the planet! But make sure you do it in style while listening to groovy tunes. Burn them, tear their limbs off, throw them off a cliff, pop their heads off or order an airstrike on the whole horde.",
