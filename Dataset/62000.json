            "review_text": "Flight Control HD is a game that is so incredibly simplistic that it might have come out back in the days of Pong. It's a game where you guide airplanes and helicopters to color coded landing pads and that's about it. Landing your very first plane and your very last one will be exactly the same. The game never changes in any meaningful way and it shouldn't take you more than a couple of minutes to realize that it's nothing but the same simple grind from start to finish.  The controls are made for a touchscreen but shouldn't frustrate you too much, the graphics are the classic mobile ones, not exactly ugly but very unfulfilled on a PC monitor.  This is not a game you should buy, it might not be bad for those 30 second mobile gaming sessions but on the PC, on STEAM, it's just a waste of space. Really and truly a game to avoid and one I would have avoided if it wasn't for the Steam event achievements.",

            "review_text": "It's a great game where you just tell which flights can land and something you partly control is how everybody will die as lots of people will. It also has tonns of features like: Planes that you can't change the path of. Wind that changes which terminals can be used. Slower and faster planes.  I would like to see a map editor and a pause button so you can figure out a way to organise before everyone dies.  Overall a great game!",
