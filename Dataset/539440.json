            "review_text": "The game is fairly simple, but I find the art style charming and the gameplay relaxing. The videos on the store page provide a very accurate explanation of what the gameplay is like. I would say it has a learning curve of about 5-10 minutes. The developer is actively involved on the forums, which is nice to see. I would love to see more additions to the game in the future, like more options for house and park tiles as well as more game modes with specific goals. My only complaint is the music - I disabled it after a couple minutes but it is so repetitive that it is currently burned into my brain.",

About 60% done after a couple of hours, but should be done soon. Hopefully developer will provide new levels.",

In terms of the actual game, it is very pretty and simple. Once you get the hang of it, it becomes very repetitive and I don't see anyone being able to play this for more than a couple of hours. If you need to kill an hour by watching some numbers increase, other numbers decrease and clicking a couple times in between, then this is the game for you!",
