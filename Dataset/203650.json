Episode II as a whole is a much bigger improvement to the first episode but as a result feels very different at the same time with the graphics update and new physics enging making it feel more like its own game rather than a continuation, however you still go through 4 zones with 4 acts so structure is mostly the same as the first episode.  The partner mechanic is a new feature that lets you take control of both Tails and Sonic simutaneously  Metal Sonic returning from Sonic CD continuity wise is your new rival Music I think is better, Metal Sonic's theme is amazing and I could listen to Death Egg Mk II anytime  I recommend this game to people who only liked the first episode. It's still not a good follow up to Sonic the Hedgehog 3 nor is the level design of the zones the game's based around is good (never really was a fan of the original Sonic the hedgehog game in 1991) but it's mostly okay, could be much better. I hope to one day see an Episode 3 from Sonic Team just to see what becomes of Little Planet trapped inside the Death Egg.",

            "review_text": "Sonic the Hedgehog, that little blue ball of fur. He whizzes around in a blur. Faster than a speeding bullet. The thrill! The exhilaration!   Those wonderful feelings that come to mind whenever I think of Sonic and his buddies. When thinking of a character like Sonic, it's hard to separate nostalgia from true feelings. Hopefully I'll be able to do that!  Sonic 4: E2 is a fun platformer. Colourful landscapes, and cute enemies create a vibrant atmosphere. The graphics are acceptable for a 2D game in this generation. The game struggles to run on low end machines, even those that pass the system requirements. The game just isn't playable with system lag, or low FPS.  The gameplay is okay, but I do have a few issues. To me Sonic was a different kind of platformer. It was all about whizzing through the levels as fast as possible. I got great joy from timing my jumps just right, getting enough coins for the special levels and bouncing off the enemies on the way. Unfortunately S4E2 doesn't feel right. Sonic at full speed feels sluggish, and that's a word you never want associated with our heroic hedgehog. I never felt out of control, Sonic never flew off the screen. Some people might call that a good thing, but I think a fair few fans would agree with my perspective.  I was able to play some levels co-op. The levels are the same, one player controls Sonic, the other Tails. The problem with co-op is as soon as one character gets a little bit away from the other, the player behind has to use the catch up button. This just made the game feel like a chaotic mess. However, this chaotic mess was extremely fun. It enabled some awesome near-death escapes.  The game is trying hard to be like the 2D Sonic games of old. It introduces some new abilities, like forming a super-ball of death with Tails (which is the best way to go through 80% of levels), or dashing through the air by double jumping. Ultimately this is where it fails. It's an okay platformer, and it has a pricepoint that reflects the length of the game but it doesn't stand up to classic Sonic games.  Whilst the game does not stand up against previous Sonic games, it is quite a fun platformer. The levels are a nice length and fun to run through once. There isn't much replayability there though.  Bottom Line: Fun co-op game. A little lacklustre when compared to classic Sonic.",

The only thing is, the special stages in 4.1 were unique and the special stages in 4.2 are rehashes from sonic 2. I enjoyed 4.2 more than 4.1, it also has coop which is a little bit fun but not quite perfected.  S4.2 is about a 8/10, worth under $5 if you like the sonics.

If you've played Sonic 4 Episode 1, you'll probably guess that this game is probably as bad as the first one, and you would be 75% correct. Sonic 4 Episode 2 is yet another dissapointing release in the never ending Dark Ages of Sonic, which is an on-going line of bad Sonic games starting from 2006, and this one has joined the bandwagon.  Instead of being based off Sonic 1, this one is based off Sonic 2 and rightly so, only because it has Tails in it.  The gameplay is not too shabby and it is actually better than the first one, but it still has some kinks. The physics are still kind of bad but not as bad as Episode 1. There's also no copying of any of the previous zones from old Sonic games, but some zones are similar to other zones seen in the Sonic series, but I can't really list them all.  The story is really hard to notice due to all of the characters refusing to talk during the entire game, in all seriousness a storyline isn't really here in this game.  This game relies way too heavily on the special Sonic + Tails moves, most of the game requires you to use those moves. Like in Oil Desert Zone act 2 or 3, the end of the act requires you to use the flying-Tails-carrying-Sonic thing for the rest of the act, and I've died a few times in that part.  The Co-op mode is ok, and suprisingly it is accurate to Sonic 2's co-op mode: You both have to stay on the same gosh darn screen.  It's still not a worthy sequel to the Sega Genesis Sonic we all know and love, but it is slightly better than episode 1. This game is really only for bored gamers waiting for something interesting to happen and for crazy Sonic fans who collect every Sonic game known in exsistance both good and bad.  4.7/10  But hey, at least it's better than Sonic Unleashed!    Before I go, there is one more problem with game. If you get all of the Chaos Emeralds and beat the game, you don't get some cool 'true ending' cutscene, or even a picture of Super Sonic, dissapointing I know.  ",

New addition to this is 2 player coop mode. It can be awesome to play with a friend but because you have little screen to keep up it kinda gets frustrating and hard to see what other player is doing. As always you can collect rings, get into “Special stages” to collect 7 Chaos Emeralds to transform into Super Sonic.

            "review_text": "Don’t be put off by the game’s lack of commercial success. First it should be said the both parts of Sonic 4, Episode 1 (4.1) and Episode 2 (4.2) seem to have an identity crisis. They are officially sequels but in reality they are something of an updated remake, 4.1 and 4.2 borrow and reference Sonic 1, 2, 3&amp;K and CD heavily; 4.1s bosses are all remakes of the originals, a fault 4.2 even references with the first boss originally appearing to mimic the Aquatic Ruins’ Boss before transforming into something new. However even it borrows the later levels and boss fights. The level design 4.2 is also much better than 4.1’s. As 4.2 has original zones; Sylvanian Castle, Winter Park Zone and the Oil Desert (whose features resemble 3&amp;K’s Sandopolis much more than Sonic 2’s Oil Ocean which it would appear to be a copy of at first glance). After this 4.2 does fall into copying the final zone which is just an amalgamation of Wing Fortress, Sky Chase and the Flying Battery zones, taking features from each but making them worse (in the Sky Chase knock off for example Tail’s Plane can disappear leaving the player plummeting to earth).  There are problems with both games; they both insist on the use of Sonic’s homing attack to access ledges which I find it unnecessary for a side-scroller. Again Physics does not seem to apply in Sonic the Hedgehog’s universe, he can walk up walls when travelling at fairly low speeds (although not as badly as he could in 06), while the homing attack creates momentum from nothing.  Even the traditional saving grace of the Sonic game, the soundtrack, is poor which is disappointing. In addition, the game also has a very short life span, 4.1 failed to keep me attached for more than 5 hours, and while 4.2 actually saw me to completion, it only has at most 5-12 hours of gameplay depending on how quickly you can master it and I doubt either has much in the way of replay value unlike the games they are based upon.  This said however, for once Sonic actually controls well (which he never does in 3D Games). 4.2 itself still contains a number of very good features. The inclusion of team mechanics was a great idea as it makes Tails a valued partner to Sonic, his abilities have made him an essential part as he can get Sonic through traps and defeat opponents. 4.2 also did well with the special stages, which like 4.1s are copies of the original games (this time the tunnel runs of Sonic 2,) unlike 4.1 however, 4.2 improves the originals. Tails is no longer a dead weight, he doesn't drop rings when hit and a new power up (a chaotix ring type feature) can give new interesting challenges, it is just a pity they weren’t used more often.  Therefore although neither are great like the games they were trying to emulate, they are ok and I generally do not see why they have been so badly received as they’re worthy successors to the original Sonic. 4.1 may be distinctly average but 4.2 is a big improvement upon it. The current price tags are not value for money but if you pick them up in the Steam sale (as I did) 4.2 is certainly worth a fiver. 4.1 should only be purchased if you want the bonus Metal Sonic Mode which works when you own both parts.

While the first two acts you could probably breeze through, the next two, Oil Desert and Sky Fortress, just surge in difficulty where the first two had it in small bursts. The worst part, however, is the bosses. Again, the first two bosses are not all that difficult if you have some knowledge of the mechanics of the game. The third boss in Oil Desert, however, is mostly boring climbing and occasionally waiting for Eggman to reveal his weak spot. However, the point where I stopped playing, and I am pretty sure that I cannot give this game anything other than a 'not recommended' review after having game over'd from it twice, is Sky Fortress's boss.  To put it shortly, Sky Fortress has you fighting Metal Sonic in the blue carrier from before. However, his strategy is far different from Sky Fortress Act 1. For the first portion of the fight, he will move to either the top or the bottom of the screen and fire screen-filling lasers at you. You have to hit Metal Sonic in the cockpit, which, provided you don't completely outrun the carrier yourself, is somewhat easy. The next phase is also fairly self-explanatory: Metal Sonic will move to the right side of the screen and fire bird bots and lasers along the screen, simply avoid him and hit Metal Sonic. The last part, however, is down-right impossible at first glance. The screen fills up with missiles (apparently supposed to be in the background), and much larger missiles fly towards you, albeit rotating as they come to you. What it doesn't tell you, however, is that the one move designed to destroy stuff in the way, the team-up command, doesn't break through the missiles, but it is instead to hit Metal Sonic who is way out in front. If you can't keep up with the screen, you are thrown back to the beginning of the battle. Mind, this battle is fairly long, and, again, they don't tell you ANYTHING during the fight, except on what half of the screen the missiles take up. If you're lucky you can get multiple hits on MS in the earlier portions to speed up everything, but what's the point if you die in one hit at the end of the battle unless you have the reflexes of some kind of god or something?  There's a reason the classic games' bosses were simple, but not so simple that a monkey could simply wail on a genesis controller and win. Well... there's a reason THREE of the four classic games didn't do that. Sonic 2's bosses were kind of REALLY easy at times. So, for a game supposed to be a modern game built as a sequel to the classic quadrilogy, this fails pretty cohesively as a sequel, even if Sonic 4 Episode 1 apparently failed that much harder.",

            "review_text": "I will update this review when I have completed the game to talk about it's gameplay. For now, I've only played a little bit and I'll be talking about it's PC compatibility.  When I first played Sonic the Hedgehog Episode I on my laptop, nothing would work. No matter what software I downloaded, no matter how many times I verified the game cache, no matter how many times I updated Windows, and even after the multiple times uninstalled and reinstalled the game, it would not work. After two weeks of sadness and hatred towards Sega, I uninstalled and reinstalled the game one more time and it finally worked for no reason known to me. Because of this struggle, I was very skeptical of Sonic the Hedgehog 4 Episode II's PC compatibility. But I was far from disapointed.  When the game is first setup, it automatically looks for what required software such as DirectX you do and do not have on your computer, and immediately installs what you do not have. This potentially saved me weeks of stress and pain over the game not working if I were to not already have everythin necessary. It has a pretty low default resolution for the game (300 x 200), and I was afraid that the graphics would either be ugly or the game would run slow. Fortunately, even at high resolution (1208 x 1024), it ran at a smooth 60 fps and this time the graphics looked like Sega actually tried this time. Instead of trying to have the graphics of Sonic the Hedgehog 1 in HD, this game instead had apporximately the graphics of Sonic Generations, only zoomed out. It wasn't like I have an impressive intel core i7 processor of 4.7 GHz, either. My processor is a intel core i3 of 2.1 GHz and it ran this game fine. So if you're afraid of this game because the last one didn't work or hard ugly graphics, don't be. So far this seems like a true Sega game. I have played a level or two and everything runs like a horse. The level design was very nostalgic and stayed true to Sonic.",

            "review_text": "Two player mode can be quite frustraiting due to various minor glitches and because Sonic's air attack make him too quick for 2nd player (Tails). Also, Tails is far too useful, you pretty much have to haul Sonic's assets everywhere you go, especially in the water. It is because of this that I still wonder why Tails isn't a playable character in Smash Bros...  Still, this game is pretty good. It heavily reminds me of Sonic 2. You could practically call it 'Sonic 2 HD'.   This game is a lot of fun in 2 player mode. Just remember that those sand traps in the second chapter are just plain ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in 2 player mode, you may have to complete that one map in single player mode.",

II holds improved graphics and physics* which make this game more enjoyable the Episode I, with hard Special Stages from Sonic 2 and not easy versions of Sonic 3D Blast**, this can be also a short game EXACTLY like Sonic 4 Ep. I being 1 hr. &amp; more or less, 30 mins. DLC? If you can call the exclusive Episode Metal you get when you own both Episode I &amp; II DLC, then no. There's no DLC. Just. Like. Episode I. This game is very Linear. This game improves by a handfull. Not by alot, just a little. I'll give it 8/10  *By improved physics I mean a removed Rush Engine, thank God.  **Sega Saturn Version, not the Genesis or PC versions, morons.",

Literally, Sonic can now roll down hills. Momentum has been mostly fixed, as well as a lot of the physics, which I know a lot of people would probably complain at me if I didn't state that. It's not a perfect simulation of the old physics, but it works. The music is still trying to emulate the older games, but this time it sounds less like a trip to a wood chipper. The Stardust Speedway remix was a nice touch, too. The main gripe I have with this is that whenever lag occurs, the game overcompensates for it and actually /speeds up/ when there's lag. I've been playing the entire game at double or triple speeds, compared to videos online. GOTTA GO FAST at its finest.",

This is more improved version of Episode I that has several Sonic The Hedgehog 2 elements such as similar Special Stages and the Sonic and Tails co-op. The game adds new elements such as tag actions which can only be done with both Sonic and Tails. Although this game fixes many problems of the first episode, this game still feels like a regular platform game. Episode Metal feels and plays almost exactly like Episode I. The levels are reversed stages from the first episode with added hazards. Nothing really new or exciting is shown in Episode Metal.  Rating: 7/10 'You can't speed'",
