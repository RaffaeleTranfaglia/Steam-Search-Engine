            "review_text": "11/10: Would throw bunny repeatedly into saws again, and again.  500 deaths into the game and it's only getting more difficult. If you played Super Meat Boy, you know what to expect here. There's a bit of a learning curve that will have you staring at the screen, timing the individual saw blades. After that you're constantly dashing around, and the A/D side-scrolling controls make that easy enough. That is until you find yourself met by the game's sense of inertia, with the rabbit under your control being constantly turned to mince meat.  There is also a great sense of accomplishment once you beat a level, after nearly 100 deaths! With plenty of carrots to collect along the way.  Pros: Short intro that lets you play right away! Great soundtrack. Addictive levels.  Cons: You yell randomly at your screen.",

            "review_text": "This game is a lot of fun. It's a bit like Super Meat Boy but with enough differences to allow it to come out from under that rather large shadow. I used the steam controller and I had no problems with the controls. I did have to set the back paddle on my controller to 'none' as it had initially been setup as the kill switch which became problematic but easily fixed. Some very interesting level designs. I also really enjoyed the music. This was a wonderful addition to my collection.",
