            "review_text": "I'm gonna be really frank about this game. I did not enjoy it much at all.  TLDR: This game has potential and a good concept, just really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and annoying execution and makes you rage not because you can't figure out the puzzle, but because of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mechanical issues.  Even though I did not enjoy this game, there are still good parts of the game. First of all, the concept is actually really cool and refreshing. I actually enjoyed that aspect of the game being a puzzle and turned based as well as luring enemies into traps/rivers. Also the soundtrack is pretty nice, even if there really is only two.  Now time to criticize this game. Let's start with the controls. The movement keys are 12346789 and 5 is wait. I understand that you need to mvoe diagonally in this game, but holy ♥♥♥♥ing hell those are honestly the most annoying ♥♥♥ keys, especially for laptop players without a numpad. I was fortunate enough to have a laptop with a numpad, but those keys still ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off so much. What is worse is that I could not find for my life a 'customize' your keys option.  Aside from the keys, which I actually did somewhat start to get used to but still found awkward, the game is really punishing. Messing up at the end of the level brings you all the way back to the beginning of the level and some levels you need to do a lot of movement and thinking along the way. Furthermore, if you mess up one part of the level earlier on, you may actually not be able to complete a future one. If I hadn't saved up one of my attacks, I would have not been able to pass the next level. This punishment combined with awkward keys ♥♥♥♥ed me over so many times. I'd accidently hit 4 instead of 7 or 1 instead of 4 and fall into a river at the end of the level and have to restart. I can understand the game being difficult and I appreciate myself some difficult puzzles that took me a while to figure out, but this kind of difficulty due the user playability being ♥♥♥♥♥♥ is just not good.  Another really annoying part is that sometimes the movement of the enemies seems rather WTF. So the roach couldn't move diagonally at first, then all of a sudden half the times it can move diagonally and half the times it doesn't. How is the player supposed to kite the roach correctly without knowing when it will move diagonally. I'm sure there is some formula for its movement that I just didn't figure out, but devs please, at least give us a defined movement forumla that is more easily tangible. I was able to figure out your hard puzzles but never figured out the movement formula.  Lastly, the game does not have a great save feature. There is only one save and load, else you start a new game. So if you ♥♥♥♥ed up your levels for good halfway through... well lets just say that you gotta start over. Also when you go to the menu, the game lags for a good 5 seconds and you can't do anything. Speaking about not doing anything, the achievements are crazy hard to get as well. I was not even able to get a single achievement in all the time I put in and when I looked at the global stats, only like 3% of people were able to get one fo the achievements and that was the most that people have achieved.  With all the negatives put together, this game really is lacking in refinement. Should the devs refine the user experience, then this game could be really really fun. But as of right now, I really cannot recommend this game since it is just too lacking in polishing.  Rating: 6.2/10 Recommend: Don't buy this until it is more refined OR for under $0.50 since there are trading cards",
