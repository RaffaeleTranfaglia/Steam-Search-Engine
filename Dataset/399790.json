Battle system was alright, though grossly imbalanced hp totals/damage. Fights took a while, especially when the monsters chose to 'guard' which didn't add any depth to the game - just made the fights longer (monsters doing 20 hp damage attacks on 2000 hp heroes).   Music was alright, but I had to uninstall when it wasn't much fun after a while.",

It's not 'inspired' by Naruto, it's 'Copying' Naruto.  In all this 0.2 hours, there's almost no single original stuffs. Monster ravaging the land? Check. One hero that sealed the monsters? Check. Land dedicated to that hero? Check. Main character woke up late? Check. Main character is a teen? Main character given 'starting stuffs' by his mom? Check. Main character's best friend is the intellect type while the character is the power type? Check. Another MC's friend is class clown? Check.  And from that point, it's all Naruto. I can easily see who's 'inspired' by who in this game.  Who the hell uses Western naming, when the setting is clearly Eastern. You might as well go with painfully cliche eastern name, rather than using western name for a NINJA game.   The dialog is painful to read. SINCE WHEN, DOES A INSTRUCTOR, CALLS HIS STUDENT, BRO??!?!?!?!?? REALLY  The plot is a RPG main pillar. Screw that up, and your game is gone.  I won't reccomend it to anyone in particular, even Naruto fans.",

            "review_text": "Destiny Warriors is a combination of questionable plot with half of characters being idiots, giant imbalance of battles, with them spreading equally between awfully boring (because they last 15 minutes each) and impossibly hard (stun-lock before you can do anything) and the fact that developer never heard of a dictionary - amount of grammar and punctuational mistakes is overflowing.  The fact that this is an RPG maker game does not makes this game bad, no. Its developers lameness that does. OK, typos do happen, but with frequency like that, I stopped paying careful attention to plot. Lack of commas makes text hard to read and there are dots missing between many sentences making it impossible to understand what is written here and there. Note that english is not my native language but even with my little skill I can spot countless errors. Battle balance is even worse: both enemies and characters have very big HP and very low attack. This makes killing enemies unnecessary long and dying nearly impossible. However, 25% of battles work differently: you have even worse damage, but one spell that does big damage, but enemy - it either does genocidal damage or stunlock 3/4 of your party on first move. I am writing this review as I struggle through last battle where you have ONE character at max level, which does not have any attacks that would do significant damage (except super attack which first requires drinking skill potion - to get 100 skill points for that attack, and then actually attacking, which will not happen as you will get stunned) while enemies have elemental attacks, that end your first turn by either stunning you or paralyzing. Of course, you will be dead before you can move as you can get both paralyze and stun at the same time, but they wear out not at the same time, so you get at least one of those debuffs most of your turns. If the battle is an easy one, it will be boring. The big HP and low dmg extend battles to very long times. There is nothing else about them except that enemy lvl scales as you level up, but enemies characteristics - and that is AT LEAST agility which determines turn order and is most noticeable to this as after level up you frequently no longer attack first - grow faster. Thankfully, boss battles are of a fixed levels. For graphics and sound - PURELY default RPG maker assets. I was unable to see anything unique in this game. The only thing that was quite good is that developer used different character faces for different emotions. Not every rpg maker game does this, so it is nice too see this small feature, especially that facial expressions go very well with a plot. But the game fails in many places, so its not really helping. Plot is so-so. People say that its a Naruto ripoff, but I haven't watched that cartoon so can't say. But what I can say is that its too much absurd at times.  I would not recommend buying this even with 90% discount, too much bad development choices make this game true mess. But if you like CRAZY plots - you might want to check it out, but make sure that you play on easy difficulty, as last boss is still hard as hell. People say that on hard, its unbearable right from the start of the game.",

            "review_text": "There are plenty of RPGMaker RPG's (or even non-RPG's like 'To The Moon') who are actually good.  Sadly, this is not one of them. Infact, there's nothing redeeming to be said about this title. Let's start with the story. You fight rouges (who look a lot like rogues instead of mascara, but let's ignore that for the moment) for plot-critical documents... a shopping list for the Kings Wife. Well, there's your plot. The only thing more horrible than it are the dialogues. Even though the best part of a RPG is already ruined, maybe it's gameplay can salvage somewhat?  Well, nope. You fight with 4 people. You can equip them in the city, except, you only get the player at that point so you pretty much need to guess/have identic memory or note down what the hell the other 3 can even wear in the first place. So far the good stuff, combat is pretty much mashing spacebar (using chi or tp has little use), sometimes using right to select another target. Do take care not to press too much while mindlessly battling, as right can also start the combat. And if no action is taken you don't auto-attack or defend or anything, nope you're just have your turn wasted. Great mechanic! In the starting areas you battle lvl 5-8 enemies, in the following areas too. Well, you are level 15 now, but hey, here are some level 3 rats for this high-level area. Enemies can come randomly (oh noes), out of crates (well, that just sucks) and if you're stupid enough to wander into the random enemies. Talking about random enemies, they can't actually initiate combat with them, you need to run into them. Leading to many accounts of moonwalking enemies just humping you hoping for you to foolishly walk in their direction. Silly random mobs, who would torment themselves to even more of this combat system?  Well, those underleveled foes become a blessing when the bosses end up, who ARE at your level. 1000HP+ with your attacks doing 10 damage per hit. Have a fun 20 minutes slashing into it. Sure gets that 12 hours there. And once you FINALLY defeat the darn thing (make it end!) ANOTHER boss turns up right after it without chance to save. Sure you can use potions to heal but overall you start with what you got (like no magic). Not that it matters anyway since this second boss is so magic resistant you need to rely on melee attacks. Have another 20 minutes of... 'fun'...  Yeah, me? I went for the uninstall button instead. Bad gameplay, bad plot, bad dialogue... Bad game.",

Destiny Warriors reminds me of Dragon Warrior or the original Final Fantasy. Visually, it looks like a retro RPG and has decent music and sound effects. I think this game has been much better developed than Secret of Magia, which was also put out by the same developers. As a lover of RPG's, this is a fun game. The story seems interesting and I am curious to see where the plot takes me.",

It could have made it with less swearing but I guess a bunch of teenagers won't hold their tongues when traveling in a group. Anyways the end was really difficult I had to redo and retry everything I had in my arsenal to defeat enemies that burned - froze - paralyzed - stunned you at the same time but its doable. The amount of customization is really big (over thousands of items.) And the fighting mechanics are great too like = You can defeat your enemies with normal attacks. Or use modes, try to defeat them with your class specialized x-tu or use skills like double attack, clone x-tu etc. The game also features a retry option, when you get defeated in a battle the game doesnt end right away but gives you more chances at the same battle, I think the battles are more about persistence than about skill. I think in the end you should try the game out.    P.S.: If there will be a continuation I would appreciate if the publisher could send me a key for the game. I really like all kinds of rpg games.",

If inspirised means you made an RPG using RPGMaker then i guess thats correct.  2nd big issue for me was the feel that monster levels scaled with my own. ding you leveled up and so did everything your trying to kill. but it was hard to really flush this theory out, I'm all for a bit of range in areas but if you punish the player for getting stonger thats just mean.  If you really lust/love old school RPGs then get this game, you'll feel mostly at home. The price is often right when its on sale.  When I wrote this reivew, I was close to 3hrs deep.

Not to mention the hundreds upon thousands of spelling errors.  It seems fine at first but after fighting hundreds of Ninja Rouges, (that's right not Ninja Rogues, they're Ninja Rouges) it's way to repetitive and boring. But I sailored on to see what happens.  Then I got to the tournament. God the tournament. It's so awful. It's all the flaws of the game condensed into one big pile of ugly. It shows you how the members of your party are designed to fight in a party and not alone because having to fight 1v1 in this tournament is at times as exciting as watching paint dry because some of them are for healing, not 1v1 combat. In addition to the stupid fight where you get blinded every other turn, the fight where you take forever because your healer does so little damage so it takes forever to win, the worst is yet to come in the form of fighting your friend and party member Spark. He decides to show you just how broken status effects are by paralyzing you more than he ever paralyzed all your enemies put together throughout the game. To give you an idea of just how bad it is, how long the effect of paralyze lasts seems to be completely random, maybe it lasts three turns. Maybe it lasts all of your turns and he just beat the bejeezus out of you til you get to see that stupid You Lost screen for the 30th time. And if you do break free of paralysis early, he'll just hit you with it again, giving anywhere from turn to no turns at all to heal or attack. It's garbage. Oh and to give you an idea of just how the tournament is worse in every way, every fight all the characters say the same variation of the same thing, because the writer put no effort into it. 'Hey good luck, don't hold back' and then 'Hey you got stronger' 'Yeah you too' EVERY FIGHT. FOR NEARLY 10 FIGHTS.  Then after that you get to fight a guy with rock powers who goes beast mode, then 2 of your guys go beast mode and oh good news, you do 1 damage to him with every attack and he does pretty much 1,000 damage with his. And it's a not a scripted, 'You're supposed to lose moment.' The game expects you to win. This game is okay in the beginning, then once you get to the tournament it goes downhill fast just because of all the bullpizzle going down.  Haven't beaten the game. Not sure if I want to now. It's broken, poorly written, repetitive and the characters just weren't designed to fight independent of each other but they decided to do that anyways.",
