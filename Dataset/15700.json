            "review_text": "WARNING! THIS GAME CAN BE DIFFICULT!  But, AH! The memories! :D  The protagonist of this memorable tale is named Abe. A Mudokon who was born a slave and works for RuptureFarms, a meat processing factory. One day Abe discovers that he and his kind are to be sent to the slaughterhouse. Not only that, they will soon become the 'new &amp; tasty' delicasy on the menu! He decides that he better make a break from the Glukkons who hold him captive and decides to rescue as many of his fellow Mudokons as he can along the way. And so, his unexpected quest begins!   There are a total of 99 Mudokons that await liberation. Some of them you really have to look for and there are a bunch of hidden rooms to find them in. Abe must rescue at least 50 of his kinfolk in order to survive the games ending. At times it can be a demanding task with little or no room for mistake to succeed. The game offers a very steep learning curve and rewards you with silly characters, enjoyable scenery, great music (which can and will become annoying when you get stuck), comical yet very well done cutscenes and most importantly, you will experience a fun and satisfying time overall.  PROS: + A hilariously alluring story line that draws from a serious matter concerning slavery + Fantastic character design and visual concepts + Nice graphics and animations (originally released in 1997 and it still looks pretty good) + Lots of secret rooms to discover + Innovative gameplay that will fulfill your desires for a real challenge  CONS: - The save feature is not what you'd hope for in a game this grueling (you must reach checkpoints which means you better look forward to replaying strenuous parts over and over, again and again... and again) - There is no incentive for saving all 99 Mudokons (except for a video that was only featured in the original Playstation version) - I broke at least one Playstation controller during a rage quit   I remember all the excitement of 3D gaming with the PS1 and still choosing to suffer this brutal sidescrolling platformer in 2D because the game is just so intriguingly awesome. One that still stands compelling to this day. I'd definitely recommend it. A replay even, for nostalgic purposes at least, if you're a gamer of the day. And it's absolutely worth a 'taste' if Mudokon is new to you!  My personal rating: 8.5/10",

However, I bought this with the aim of saving all 99 Mudokons, something I never did as a child. I did it and was expecting the special end cut scene for finding all the secrets and instead I got a message saying their lawyers wouldn't allow them to use the old content and instead my reward was a list of all the cutscenes through out the game and the only one that actually loaded was the bad ending. What a joke.  I feel robbed.",

It can be difficult but it's always to the fault of the player rather than the game. It encourages you to learn and solve the puzzles and you'll be eager to progress because Abe is such a likable character that you want him to succeed in the story.   I didn't get the best ending but i'll certainly return to the game again regardless; for the time being my focus will be on the sequel.   This game was made so long ago and still holds up so if you have never played it please do because you'll not be dissapointed; I played this on the first playstation and gave up at the time.   I'm glad I tried again to enter Oddworld but most of all I wish I could eat those scrabcakes to be honest.",

Coming back from my childhood, this game was one of the nostalgia flashbacks. A game my parents used to play while I watched. Now playing it for myself it's a lot more fun and the gameplay is addicting. Seriously the obsatcles in levels are a lot of fun and I feel as though I want to play it every day since I got it.   Though it can get frustrating at times, can take a while to beat the level and can be a little overbearing for some players. There are obstacles that will make you panic is you're easily scared: Such as running from enemies in a full on pursuit. The stress rate can get high at times, and even some levels are gut wrenchingly hard and make you wanna slap your computer.  Still this game is probably one of the most unique platformers out there. The player has a choice to save as many Mudokens as they feel: and depending on how many you save at the end of the game, you will be featured with an ending based on how well you did.   With so many unique ways of going about a level and the amazing cut scenes (although old), this game has it all.  I would reccomend to anyone who's into strategy platformers or just brilliant unique art styled games.  ",

            "review_text": "oddworld abe's oddysee is one of the greatest games ever created on the PS1 console. the cut scenes are amazing (even for the 90's these are pretty high class videos)  GAMEPLAY- this games plays really well, the controls are amazing on keyboard, albeit a tad confusing. BUT not to worry, if you have a playstation game pad for the PC you can hook it up and play this game to your hearts content ... well ... you could do it already if you have a keyboard, but this game is made with a controller in mind so it would only improve on this already fantastic game.  not to mention how you save game, just pause and save and you're done ... come back when you've decided you won't rage quit over how challenging the game is ... forgot to mention that actually. This game is incredibly unforgiving. one wrong move and 'BOOM' ... you're blue paste gets splattered all over the screen, and you're left to think about what would happen to your green comrades if you could not re-spawn ... a banjo kazooie 'quit game ending if you will.  it doesn't do that, i'm just saying thinking about it is weird ... what if they all get eaten and they sell your organs for dog food, humanity goes into a downward spiral as events you couldn't stop, happen. The sequels always end with the sad ending, and you're no where to be seen because you died 2 games ago, nobody even knows your name anymore. As a slag (animal) begins to munch on your tinned mudoken fingers and eyeballs, the last sentient part of you is converted into fecal matter and your race DIES ... all because you took one step to the right and got crushed by a barrel of meat ... but i digress  STORY- the story to this game is essentially one giant Eco friendly metaphor for our own industrial prowess ... but it is so subtle/just plain ignorable that it will not rest on your conscience at all. basically you're an actual 'skrub' worker in the biggest meat factory on odd-world, your bosses want to kill and sell your race to (possibly) unwary, cannibalistic consumers (it's never specified who actually buys all this food). you get found out, chase scene happens, voodoo hoodoo guy with funny mask gives you powers, and you basically take off from there. the story is a lot more in-depth than that but, meh. it would spoil a lot of the lot to go into full detail (I'M DOING THIS FOR YOU, THE PURCHASER OF THIS FINE PRODUCT! DON'T HATE ME!)  GRAPHICS- It's a ps1 game, so you can expect some ... aging, to take place. it's a side scroller from the 90's so its 32 bit graphic style will always hold up pretty well (if you're a forgiving sort of person who enjoys game play over graphics). it's not the worst game you will ever see in your life ... it definitely gives some 3D games i know of a run for there money.  OVERALL- i would definitely recommend that you buy this game, as a matter of fact, just buy the entire Oddbox bundle. you get all the Odd-world games for £6.99 (when not on sale). that is a steal for anyone's library as they are all definitely worth purchasing. strangers wrath although not as popular as other Odd-world title is definitely commendable for a referral as well.",

You are Abe a Mudokon, you and your fellow Mudokons work in Rupterfarms the biggest meat-prossesing plant on Oddworld (you are really a slave) One dark night you discover the horrible truth the Glukkens (the manegers of the factory) running out of wildlife to chup-up and now they're planning to make the Mudokons into tasty treats. Help Abe to escape Rupterfarms reveal his destiny unlock new powers and save as many Mudokons as you can. I highly recommend this game 10/10",

One of the few video games to tackle serious real-world issues, Oddysee shines a darkly comedic yet sickly light on the cruelties of factory farming, as well as the exploitation of native cultures and wildlife by corporate greed. The game deals with the dichotomy of industrial and spiritual world views, and places us into a violent, weird and odd world. Just like our own.  While these meanings and intentions are confirmed and stem from Oddworld's brainchild Lorne Lanning, all of this is likely lost on most of Oddworld's audience. It certainly was lost on me when I played it as a small child. However, Oddworld Inhabitants provided an exciting, intruiging and challenging experience in Oddysee whether or not the meanings were decoded. And later on, when the messages become more prevalent, it simply gives us more to talk about, and furthers the cause of games as effective, communicative art.  Overall, Abe's Oddysee is a great game with a compelling setting and story. Exoddus is a brilliant follow-up, with more of the same. Both highly recommended and unexpectedly intelligent gems.",

Thanks to Steam, I was able to try out this Playstation 2 gem. All I can really state about Abe's Oddysee is that it is not simple. You make a mistake, you die. The only way to continue through each and every level is with trial and error. Does this work? No. Does that work? No. How about this? Yes. That will be what occurs while going through each and every stage. To make matter worse, the better endings require you to save other Mudokons. The first time through this, I did not save enough Mudokons which provides you with a, not so good, ending. I was kind of disappointed with that ending, so I trudged through the game once again to save more Mudokons. Finding some of these buggers can and will be tiresome. This game REQUIRES you to look EVERYWHERE and the kitchen sink. There are a total of 99 of these Modokons to find, which will take hours of hunting. I have yet to find all of them. It's a good thing that 50 Modokens will give you the good ending, because they can be difficult to acquire at times. Getting good at this game takes multiple play through's, but mastering this gem is worth every minute. Oh, and I'm forgetting the most important part of the game. You can make Abe fart.  Now for the recommendation of this. I can only recommend this to those willing to play through this without looking at walkthroughs and willing to fail over and over again. The feeling of accomplishment will be felt through your entire body and soul.",

But apart from that, gameplay is awesome, Mostly stealth but in it's own unique way, and feels awesome when you get to turn the tables on the enemy. The real reason to play this game though, is the atmosphere. Much like Silent Hill 2, this game is one of the greatest pieces of art due to the amazing atmosphere and feelings it conveys to the player. The Stockyard escape with the planets and stars in the background and that eerie but also peaceful music. The Paramonian temple, dark, creepy and a nightmare to us arachnaphobes everywhere. And Scrabania, the only desert/mountain based level in any game I genuinely like. You feel like you are high af (and I do mean vertically) and you can imagine the immense heat from the landscape. One of the greatest examples of atmosphere done right in any game. You can't really describe atmosphere, so basically just play it and witness it.",
