            "review_text": "The Campaign Mode and Endless Mode are fairly similar. You guide a young girl named Scout and her dog Aesop as they attempt to navigate a flooded land on her raft - in search of everyone else. Campaign mode isn't terribly long, but there's a lot of replayability in Endless Mode.   It's all about survival. You start with nothing, but by gathering raw materials here and there, you are able to craft: medical supplies, tools, weapons, traps, clothing, and upgrades for your raft. There are four hostile creatures that you often come across - snakes, boars, bears, and wolves, as well as a few very rare creatures. Each can be deadly in its own right. At the cost of some of your precious materials, there are simple tools and weapons you can use to defend yourself from them and harvest useful skins and meat. You can also devise ways to play these creatures off of each other. Why not lead that pack of wolves to the bear, and while they're distracting it, you can pop into its den to see if it's got anything useful inside. Instead of building a trap to catch some rabbits, why not chase them into a snake?  Along with meat, there are wild edibles you can harvest to keep Scout from starving, but you also need to keep a look out for clean water, and safe places for her to sleep. You'll have to find ways to treat any number of conditions she may come across - from insect stings and venomous snake bites, to dysentery and broken bones. The increasingly cold weather also poses a threat, and there's pressure to find or craft better clothing for her.   As they journey down the flooded river, they pass areas where they can dock their raft and search for supplies, but they can't stop everywhere, so sometimes you have to choose. What's more important, landing at that camp with a fire where Scout can cook some of her food before it spoils, or docking over by that liquor store in the hopes of finding some alcohol and rags to make bandages or a torch?   In the end, you always come back to the peril of the river. There are many ways to die, but the most common - hands down - is drowning. I've kept Scout alive for months from all sorts of encounters with hostile wildlife, just to lose her to the river in a matter of moments. It can get pretty tense when the raft has run into a few too many rocks or debris, and they have to cross white water country - all the while desperately looking for a Marina where Scout can repair the raft just enough to carry her onward for a few more miles... a few more days.    A few things to note  The dialogue is textual, and choices are straightforward.  The audio is really well done, from the natural ambience to the sound track and instrumentals that never get tiresome. The graphics are stylized, but clean. The community has been friendly and helpful. You're meant to die - fairly often at first. Gaining some of the achievements will take Scout to the point of death, and some actually require her death.  At the time of this review, The Flame in the Flood just recently exited early access. There have been quite a few complaints about audio and startup crashes. I had some issues early on, but since the last few updates the devs put out, I haven't had any problems at all.   There are a few bugs/exploits here and there, mostly involving the achievements. The devs have been quick to recognize them and say they're working to correct them. There are plenty of achievements that are challenging, but still fun.  There is a LOT of inventory maintenance which...is frankly annoying early on, but as you play, expand your inventory, and learn what you need to stockpile and what you don't - it becomes a little less of an issue.  I've had a lot of fun so far. Over 80 hours in, and I'm not at all bored with it. Because of its linear nature, It's very easy to pick up and play just for a little while, or for hours on end.",

            "review_text": "As a massive fan of both Chuck Ragan and Scott Sinclair, this game was a no-brainer for me. The music is awesome, and the art is amazing. With that out of the way, here's a little about the game:  Gameplay involves using your raft to navigate a river. Along the river there are different locations you can stop at to forage for supplies. There are a few different classes of locations, and each class has a different pool of items, services, and enemies that might spawn there. You'll need to decide when to stop based on your needs at any given moment and your ability to defend yourself should enemies await you. Along with genre staples like hunger, thirst, body temp, and fatigue, you need to manage a few things about your raft. Repairs, reinforcements, and hull upgrades motivate the collection of supplies beyond simply food and water. They way that those two systems (your body and your raft) interact with each other is engaging and it serves at the meat of the gameplay experience.   There isn't really combat like in Binding of Isaac or even Spelunky. Instead, combat plays more like a puzzle game where you choose to use consumables to kill, trap, or flee from animals. The catch, though, is that most of the ingredients you’ll use to dispatch animals (and in turn gather food and fur) are also useful in upgrading your raft. Will you use that lumber to build a fire and cook meat, get sleep, and craft medicine? Or will you use it to expand the cargo hold? What about a rudder to help navigate the rapids? This is a game about choices more than it is about dexterity.  There are two game modes: campaign and endless. Mechanically the two modes are identical, however in campaign mode you come across set pieces that feed you atmospheric story elements which culminate in a pretty satisfying ending. There are two difficulty settings in this mode, and I'll call them 'kinda easy' and 'ball shatteringly difficult.' I can't remember what they are actually called. In the easier mode, each of the set pieces serve as checkpoints that you can respawn at if you die. In hard mode, it's permadeath and there is a shortage of item spawns. I wasn't able to make it more than 30 minutes in hard mode, but I was able to complete easy mode in about 6 or 7 hours. I'm not sure exactly. I was extremely thorough in my playthrough, though. The difficulty in endless mode is a near perfect split between the two difficulties of the campaign, and while there is permadeath in endless mode, your dog serves as a between-playthrough storage container that you can pack with a few essential things when you start to feel the sweet embrace of death. He’ll be waiting for you when you start again.  Overall, I’d recommend it. It’s a beautiful game and the story that unfolds in campaign mode is actually really well realized - the way it illustrates certain game mechanics (specifically the dog) is very clever and it gives the in-game universe a sense of hope, perseverance, and loneliness that’s hard to explain unless you play through it. The moment to moment gameplay isn’t the most exhilarating or physically demanding in the rogue-lite market, but for what The Flame in the Flood lacks in dexterous gameplay it more than makes up for in atmosphere, theme, art, and music.

While some of the procedurally generated locations may wind up feeling a bit 'same-y' after a while, the tension and fun of trying to keep Scout heading down the river never seems to wane.  The river sections, while posing their own challenge, often achieve a visceral quietude, a brief respite of calm and beauty, with the sun beating off the whispering currents, waves lapping at your raft, and tone-perfect music accompanying your travels.  And then it's off to find grub and not get mauled by bears again.  I love it a lot. If you read the description of the game and thought 'this sounds like it's for me', then it is. ",

            "review_text": "This game was such a joy to play. Almost every aspect of it is absolutely fantstic! Flame in the Flood is a challenging but fun survival game with great art style, original music, random map generating, and a sense of exploration that left me excited at every turn to see what was next. It's a really great idea that they added an endless mode because even though I have completed the campaign, I am itching for more. I know I already mentioned it but the music is really fantastic, and is just really fits with the game and makes it even more enjoyable. I might even buy the soundtrack which I have never done for a game.   With how much I enjoyed this game, though, there were a couple of things the developers should fix or add. For instance, feathers get stuck on roofs, rocks, and other places, I would say 50% of the time, which makes it where you can't pick them up! Kinda frustrating seeing as how you need them to craft crucial items. Also, achievments don't work for me and a lot of other players sadly. I have eared maybe 14 or so without really even trying just through the first playthrough and haven't recieved any. Lastly, its not really a problem with the game, but since it relies on checkpoints for saving (and they're reasonablt far apart), I end up having to keep the game up on my computer through the night and hoping my computer won't shut off or update or keep playing for another few hours into the night when I should have gone to bed long before lol. I would be fine with keepig the death respawn back at those points, as it ups the anti and keeps it more challenging, but I wish I could somehow save it in the middle of those checkpoints so that I could maybe get more sleep :).  Even so, those bugs don't keep me from wanting to play this game for days without end and I am already looking foward to my next playthrough. If you like survival games that are easy to pick up, hard to put down, and with the best audio and visual experience you could ask for, this game definitely won't dissapoint.",

And despite this, the game still manages to pull me in time and time again. I love the mood, the artstyle and the idea. Crashes sound horrible in a game with permadeath feature, but fortunately when they occur the autosave system allows you to resume almost from the point where something went wrong.  I still recommend it, but until a few patches come out it's a bit of an unpolished gem.",

            "review_text": "Very atmospheric; everything just works really well together to create this strange, interesting world. Music, discovery/survival mechanics, art, lighting, enemy behavior and the way you are gradually forced to figure out how it all works...  It's also just the right amount of rogue-like-ness for me, which is enough procedural stuff to be interesting, but not too much obnoxious random luck required to lose interest.  Gripes: 1) the controls: only while writing this did it dawn on me that this must be a console port. The mouse is sluggish, there aren't enough keyboard shortcuts to compensate for it (e.g. 'i' brings up the entire tabbed inventory/quest/etc. dialog, but from there you're on your own to switch around; still have to click on items in the 'quick-access' slots instead of quickly using keyboard shortcuts; can't use arrow keys to get around in menus; whether you can use ESC to exit out of menus is extremely inconsistent across menu types). I have to click like 3 times in different inconvenient places to confirm I want to get to sleep, and occasionally I miss the last click and everything is cancelled and I have to start over (all while game time is ticking);   2) the interface: Some of it I could attribute to making things clunky on purpose for atmospheric purposes, but a lot of it is just about inconvenient menus, which doesn't translate well into game atmosphere, IMO. For example: to *get* water you use the inventory interface, but then to filter it you use the crafting interface. that got me stuck a few times. I have, multiple times, accidentally left a port instead of transferring things to my raft or repairing my raft because I clicked the 'raft' prompt. Sometimes the game claims that you can right-click to interact with something, but it's lying and in fact you have to run around in circles randomly until you are in just the right place to right-click to interact. If the prompt is up, clicking should work. craftable items are a flat alphabetized list instead of, say, surfacing workbench-related things up top because you are at a workbench. it's not clear what several upgrades/items do, sometimes even after you use them. ('sturdy raft' my foot!) Transferring inventory between different areas is ridiculously painful; stacks are of inconsistent max size and there's no feedback of what the max is; things that aren't stackable still say 'x1' on them. In crafting, it's never clear which required items are ingredients get used up, and which are tools that do not. Took me a couple of games to notice that a water filter is a multiple-use item. you can't see the numeric value of your food/rest/water statusi in normal gameplay, unless you go into a menu that actually minimizes that part of the interface and then shows it in a 'compact' way that happens to include numbers.  3) the RNG occasionally generates un-usuable world constructs: the reason I am writing this review right now instead of playing the game is that I rage-quit-and-uninstalled the game after I crashed on rocks I couldn't see. several times in a row. Doesn't help that dying and restarting is so frigging slow.  That said. I *am* reinstalling the game now.   ... also the steam achievements don't get unlocked for me. but I don't care that much.",

A game, that has heart and soul, that plays like countless hours were spent building, molding, shaping the world. That creates a real sense of enrichment. Like you're actually there and thats what the folks at 'The Molasses Flood' have created.   The Flame in the Flood is a tough game, there's no arguing that. Maybe not 'Darksouls' hard, but You spend countless hours surviving, crafting, on river, off river, putting together odds and ends, patching yourself up, running away and you never really feel like you're in a good spot, like you're sittin' easy. Though, to me that's how it's supposed to feel in a survival game. Thank about it, your character's a kid, who's trying to make it down river towards a mysterious radio signal, with the help of her doggo. Every decision you make is supposed to feel like it's critical, life or death.  The gameplay can get a bit tedious. sleep, eat, rain, wolves, river, just like any survival games. but the missions make it feel like you're working towards something and it does feel rewarding when you reach the next checkpoint. The inventory seems like a pain, but it feels real. I realized right away the kinds of decisions you had to make and their impact, keep this item, use that item.  What makes 'The Flame in the Flood' reall stand out? The enviroment. It is deep, it pulls you in, puts you on the edge of your seat. 'What lies around the bend?' 'Can I survive another attack?' 'How can I prepare better?' the animation is whimsical, and sounds are engrossing and the soundtrack really bundles the whole thing together. Honestly, it's like watching a pixar movie unfold, only half as tragic.   If you've been playing the countelss survival games that have been cascading out of the steam store in these last few years and enjoyed it.

The difficulty curve is high but I'd be ok with that if there was a way to get into the game and build progress and develop. But there isn't, you can only carry over 6 items with the dog and meeting any wild animals early on is a quick death. Raft upgrades are a dream that would need grinding for and finding the right elements and then have it all blown away when you die because you werent crafting weapons.  For the money there are better games out there at this level which offer a better gaming experience and give you a chance in the game. This just seems to offer the same few zones over and over without much opportunity to craft what you need to take the game on, other than relying on luck.  Its a shame as the presentation is great. Almost wish they had done it as a point and click adventure instead",

            "review_text": "So, after completing the campaign I've decided that the game isn't as bad as I had initially though, but it's still lacking. I'd like to give the game a neutral rating, but Steam doesn't offer that option.   The overall idea is that you're playing a survival game with a destination (an end goal). The game starts and progresses much like any survival game out there. You'll start with very little and as you progress things become far too easy. You'll often find yourself managing your inventory and later wondering why you even bothered.   Too many of the game's mechanics are not polished enough. The rafting doesn't really help the game in a significant way, rather it takes away. The controls for the raft don't become bearable until after you get the rudder, then it's not so bad. The flashing for lighting is headache inducing and all too often things get in the way of the camera. You'll often find it hard to see just because you don't have a lot of control over the camera itself. You can pan a little bit but you won't be able to zoom, shift, or rotate. The bow is a prime example of the game's clunky features, it's annoying to use for anything other than hunting rabbits or cheesing bears (bears will take arrows to the face and sit there).   Hunger, thirst, temperature are all meaningless stats. You'll be so stacked with items that you won't have to worry. The only things to worry about are the conditions applied by the various animals. Fatigue can be a factor, only because it sort of doubles as a health-meter (you lose chunks of it from injuries).   Basically, the music is good and the game has some fun ideas for the survival genre... but some parts just aren't polished enough.",

I have a mac thats close to five years old and I did in fact see that there were problems with older macs and whatnot. I did manage to get it to work but it was super laggy to the point were I just gave up because i couldn't do anything. I figured that it was probably just because I have an older mac and that it would work on my family's shared computer which has Windows. Same thing. Had to close it a couple of times because I would get a black screen and when I finally did manage to play the game I got the same thing I did last time. Major lag. So either there's something wrong with both of my computers or theres something wrong with the game. I'm trying to redownload it for the third time to see if that will make it work better but as of now I'm pretty irratated. The game has a great soundtrack from what little I heard of it, it has a very unique and interesting style and concept that goes along with it, but as someone who can't get past 6 minutes of playtime without it going wonky I'm fed up with it. If there's anyone that knows whats wrong or has any suggestions I'd love to hear them but for now I'm not going to be touching this game for a while.",

This game is likely to bring you over to the frusturating world that is Survival, but if you are already playing those types of games The Flame in the Flood is just an interesting distraction at best. I know people are going to laugh at my measley half hour when I say what I am about to say, but let's put it this way: I play the LONG DARK. The Long Dark is a much more hardcore survival experience than this game will ever be. The crafting system is weak, the rafting system is NOT what i expected and honestly this feels like a child's introduction into survival games. Finding a place to sleep at night is a joke. All you have to do is get into a raft, go to the first island with a building, walk up to the building and boom bam, sleep. I also find it very weird that time goes by so fast. Like 3 days passed when I was rafting to the closest island 300 meters away. Why? The wolves just don't do it for me either. They look like mangy chupacabras for one and for two they are easily out ran. In the long dark I have to take longer routes through confusing forests just to avoid getting eaten by wolves and bears on the way to a fishing hut. Also there are no parasites in the food, no pain killers or anti bodies. It's just not a realistic experience at all... I've probably offended a lot of people, but I prefer a type of game where I'm guaranteed death from the start, this game just seems very arcade like. It's a shame because the only reason I bought the Long Dark was by a fluke, I actually meant to buy this game. I'm glad i didn't. I longed to play this game for a while but when I finally got it today it just wasnt worth it. Like the top line suggests, I don't recommend this to people who want a true survivalist experience. Go play the Long Dark if you want to play a game that challenges your survival instincts. As a game this isn't so bad. It's well made, has it's own 'challenges', beautiful artwork and graphics, etc. It's just not for me. IF I had a daughter or little sister I would buy this game for them. This is one of those rare moments I struggle with a thumbs up or thumbs down. Games aren't so black and white, life isn't either. Steam should know this. So even though I place a thumbs down, know I do not hate the game, it just isn't for me.",

You collect bunch of stuff that's useless, and each time you ladn there is either a raging boar or a wolf and your knife or hammer DOESN'T DO ANYTHING and swinging your stupid stick doesn't do anything either! By the time you get to an island that doesn't have an animal on it, you die because you either starve or die from infection bite of an ant that kills you within a day.   SERIOUSLY THIS IS BAIT AND SWITCH on your $20. I saw nothing but good reviews, and all of them failed to address these basic issues. 2 hours and I am dead from dehydration and from starvation by the time I get to the second island.",

That's already a point against it in my book, but the visuals and music are so enticing I backed it on Kickstarter.  If I lost because of my own bad judgments and occasional bad luck, I'd probably stick with it, but when I lose because I can't get the damn controls to work on the river or the bloody cursor vanishes again when I'm trying to run away from something or select a menu option to open a door or eat something then it's just not worth the pain.  Playing on Mac with an attached monitor (which may explain the vanishing cursor) and using keyboard (which may explain the janky river behavior).  It's a damn shame because there's a great deal to appeal to the non-twitch-&amp;-click player here. Very interesting world which hints at a fascinating story. Trouble is it's too unpleasant to actually try to move around to get to any of that.",

Now that that's out of the way, this game is awful. I'm not sure who this game is for but as far as I can tell it is some sort of 'Auteur' version of Don't Starve. My first reaction upon seeing the dog was, 'Cool, a survival game played as an animal.' This was quickly replaced with, 'Dear God what the Hell is that!' upon seeing the knife-hewn potato that was the Protagonist's face. You may say that art is subjective. You may say that this game wasn't made for me. You may say that I just don't get it. All fair points. That being said I simply could not have fun with this game and there is nothing worse than a game that just isn't fun.",
