            "review_text": "  I got this game from the Otakumaker #11 Bundle so i guess it counts as 'free game'. ____________________  First i wasn't sure about the game, it looked very odd to me and based on the reviews i thought it's going to be garbage (Nothing against the devs) The first minutes of gameplay were a bit boring because i only had a few weapons but later on it became quite intense and with like 10 weapons in the inventory it became fun to play. Especially the Disco-Gun which made me laugh.  ==Gameplay== Not the best gameplay i've ever seen because the controls are quite tricky but after a while you learn how this game works and it becomes easier for you to dodge and aim at enemies. The enemies are also very nice. There are quite a few different enemies, from normal tackling melee enemies up to pulling scorpion enemies there is a large variety of enemies.  ==Graphics== You cannot really compare the graphics with other games, but it's nice to look at them especially in the later levels. 5 Stages, each stage using the same map but due to different locations and angles the background always changes and becomes more awesome over time. Generally most of the weapons are great designed. 'Disco Gun' is one of them :P  ==Great progression system== Chose between Technological and Organic, each of them giving you access to a specific set of weapons and abilities. This is great due to different gameplay tactics and progression tactic. 30 Perks pretty much buff your entire ship or the environment around you, as example 'Summon' spawns sometimes a black hole that fires a laser to a random enemy, instantly killing it.  ==WEAPONS!== As mentioned already, there are a lot of unique weapons. Each of them offers something special. I don't want to spoil the special guns so let me stay with the regular weapons. Laser as example is a - you guessed it - laser weapon that fires regular low damage bullets to your enemies. Magnetic gun however is more of a shotgun type, Singularity gun is a wave cannon with piercing effect. And there are so many more weapon, from heavy but long recharging weapons up to unique weapons like the Disco-Gun which makes everyone dance... literally.  Negative: The third boss is so annoying -_-  Other than that, great game!  Recommended? Yeah, if it is on sale or within a bundle. Maybe not on it's full price.  Played 10 hours total, but offline.",
