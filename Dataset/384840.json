            "review_text": "Well, where should i start. The game has it's pros and cons but it's cons outweigh the pros for me to decide that it is a terrible game for now? Not everything has been released yet 'Coming Soon' with only 3 hours of gameplay that gets a little boring after a while due to the repetition in farming/grinding materials.  Personally, i like these kind of simulation rpg games but Dead but alive just doesn't fit it, there is no feel of adventure, action, there is nothing that really stands out in the game besides the fact it is a visual novel type game. The combat system is plain right terrible, with the use of a scroll wheel to determine how much damage you can inflict to zombie. Oh and yes, a visual novel game it is, there is romance, you can develop relationships through the actions you make BUT with dead or alive, there isn't much interaction with the characters, all interactions and conversations with the characters are SET, they will only talk to you because it's set that way, you can rarely start conversations with the characters which disables you from constantly trying to improve your relationship with your fave characters.  It depends on how you view this game, if you want to try it out just for it's survival rpg element, go ahead and try the DEMO on their site, or maybe even because it's a visual novel game set in a world of zombies? Well, if you really like a survival rpg element, i'd rather recommend going to play This War of Mine, as i played through this game, it reminded me of This War Of Mine which had the similar basic functions and aspects, just that This War Of Mine was more interactive but without the visual novel aspects of developing relationships and choosing set choices that are given to you.  AND the game won't start occasionally and crashes!  My rating of the game in it's current state : 5/10",

            "review_text": "Careful! This game is addictive and has very hot girls to romance. When you first start the game you can choose to either play as a simulation or as a visual novel (with no combat system). I like the combat system, because it´s something new. Basically you need to stop a running slot machine and exactly the right moment to get a high number. The managment of the camp is not very complex, but it´s a visual novel after all and the game clearly puts its focus on the story. I don´t want to give you any spoilers, but the story is very, very cool and well written.  Pros: +Addictive story +Great characters +Number of choices you can make +Choices impact +Well painted FullHD artwork  Cons: + Technically simple  10/10 will play again",

Playing this game was like an interactive movie, but you make the choices. I can fully recommend it not only for 'The Walking Dead' universe fans, but to all people who like visual novels.",

An interesting take on combat and cool characters and interaction options (including romance). Beware, can become addictive... Oh, and the setting is on the UK, for the sake of variation. :) Highly recommended.",
