            "review_text": "Batman: Arkham City is the 3rd person beat em up, open world sequel to the Arkham Asylum game where once again you play as not only Batman, but a few missions as Catwoman. There are so many criminals in Gotham City that someone decided Black Gate prison and Arkham Asylum can't house them all, so now there's an entire city district now being used as a prison / asylum. With that logic out of the way, this is an open world game unique unto itself. The city is gorgeous, every part of the city is a vista no matter how grimy areas are, they're all so beautiful. Every locale oozes personality, from a frozen police station to a clown infested steel mill. No exterior seems copied and pasted and that says a lot. There is an amazing attention to detail and the game still runs silky smooth.  While the city (district) is big, it doesn't feel huge, there are missions that will have you from one end of the city (district) to the other in about two minutes, because Batman knows how to get around. You'll glide from place to place, dive kick enemies and use your grappling hook to quickly get from rooftop to rooftop. Not only that, but just holding the run button has a lot of functionality, it'll let you jump, climb and even glide. So you never miss a beat. Catwoman has a whip to get around. She can also cling to walls and ceilings.  The streets are still dangerous, that's where most of the enemies are. You can keep to the rooftops or stealth around them. You can take out enemies stealthily one by one by using gargoyles to hide in the shadows and floor or wall grates to move through from point A to point B all to evade enemy detection. You'll hear them talk about things and when they find one of their comrades down, they'll be more alert and eager to shoot down gargoyles so you won't have that one to hide on. Once you get far enough in the game, you'll unlock challenge rooms which revisit previous locations, but with more challenge that you need to take out the enemies using stealth.  Almost all of the major villains are back from Arkham Asylum, proving Batman should really start killing his greatest foes. Not just that, but there are new villains and almost all of them have their own gang. This gives the goons more style, but really, the goons are all the same for the most part resorting to just brawlers and gunmen. Eventually the game amps things up with long range snipers, armored brawlers, shielded brawlers, knife wielders and stun batoners. If a gun or weapon gets knocked out of the hand of a gunman, someone else can pick it up. The brawlers will pile on you, sometimes two dozen at a time, and as Batman, you can easily if not tediously defeat them. Batman: Arkham City is essentially a beat em up with a lot of traversal. Batman really just has one attack button to spam and Batman will do all of the punching, kicks, sweeps and brawling himself. When enemies telegraph an attack, you have a counter button. There are other enemies that require you to use a stun maneuver, but you might forget you even have it. The gunners require a lot more finesse to deal with, since Batman can easily be murdered by anything with a gun, even when you start upgrading your armor. The AI of the gunners is great, they'll patrol, warn others when they find a downed ally. While the enemy variety is very limited, they all seem very smart, so that makes up for it. Why have specific enemy types when they're all smart enough to do anything?  Other than brawling, Batman has other tools and a quick switch menu using the D-pad. You'll start out with everything you earned in the previous game. Multiple batterangs, remote control batterangs, a zip-line, explosive gel, a grappling hook to rip down high up grates, a new smoke bomb to hide when you've been spotted, freeze grenades, which are good for freezing one enemy at a time and floating through the sewers. You'll quickly find a new electricity gun for lack of a better term that will power devices like garage doors. Everything in the arsenal can be used for combat or traversal.  Making its return is also detective mode that lets you see hints, such as highlighting enemies, seeing them through objects, lit up gargoyles you can grapple onto, doors, grates, footprints, sniper rifle trajectories and the Riddler's riddles. Speaking of the riddles, in the previous games they were just collectables. At the most you had to blow up a wall using explosive gel to reach them. Now you'll need to solve puzzles to get them. It is amazing the level of detail that was put into this game, even just for these common puzzles. You'll come across them often.  Speaking of the level of detail, the side quests aren't just quests, but they feel like extra storylines. Everything is fully voiced. Every NPC, villain, thug, Batman and Catwoman. You'll hear thugs discussing things, along with radio transmissions every so often. In the previous game you were taunted by the Joker who is voiced by Luke Skywalker for those that remember the old Batman: The Animated Series. Kevin Conroy reprises his role from the series as Batman, and they're both excellent. There are plenty of other major voice acting stars such as Tara Strong, Nolan North and Maurice LaMarce.  With the actual game out of the way, there is the 'Riddler's Revenge' mode, which are challenge rooms like the first game had. Combat rooms where you get a high score beating up waves enemies. Then there are 'predator maps' that require you to take out gunmen in specific ways to beat the challenges. There are even downloadable challenge rooms, mini campaigns and even a make your own challenge map where you chose a map and select goals. You'll also get to select your character from Batman, Catwoman, Robin and Nightwing. Since this is Game of the Year Edition, you'll have plenty of costumes to chose from.  The Game of the Year Edition comes with the Harley Quinn's Revenge DLC that has you playing as Robin and Batman in an extra hour or two mission. It has a good quick story and quality voice acting, but it won't expand that much. Robin plays mostly like Batman and has the same tools as he does with a few exceptions. Its nice to have, but I couldn't imagine it being worth the purchase price outside of getting it free in the Game of the Year Edition.  To top that off, there is a lot of extra content for players and Batman fans. Profiles on every character with detailed information. Challenge rooms to unlock and play through for high scores. This is an amazing game that feels and looks completely different than anything else out there. It is really enjoyable as a game, not just as a Batman fan.  There is a ton of content in Arkham City. Well worth $20, unless you can find it on sale or in a bundle like I did. I just feel bad for any game that has to follow this up. Not only another game in the franchise, but I feel bad for competing games. This game makes great use of the Batman mythos while new superhero IPs like Infamous just don't have the fleshed out characters to draw from. This is an amazing win and a crushing defeat to any other super hero game.",

This game I would say is not a full sandbox (open world) game but pretty close. I do recommend Arkham City over Asylum any day of the week. If you love a game you can turn your brain off and smash buttons this is the game for you. Alway fun to see how high of combo score you can get. The Story in Arkham City was so much better then Asylum. I found the story very captivating and always wanted to see what was going to happen next. And just when you think it ends and your disappointed it still goes very good put together game. You can tell its geared more towards the teenage crowd. The $29.99 price tag is a litte high yet since this game almost two years old and the new Batman Arkham Origns is out for $39.99. If you see this game on sale for 50% off well worth it I played it for over 20 hours and it has a lot of extra missions as Robin which were fun.",

Arkham City IS the best batman game there ever was, infact it's the best Batman story ever told and playing the game makes you feel like you are Batman not just in a movie, but in real life. It's grim, real, immersively addictive so much to the point you WILL have withdrawal symptoms when you stop playing.   I NEVER expected a game to make me feel the way Arkham City made me feel, having played many AAA games, this one takes the place for the Best game there ever can exist.",

            "review_text": "Batman Arkham City takes the incredibly strong foundation created in Arkham Asylum and builds on it a magnificent skyscraper. Everything that made the original game a great experience has been expanded and improved upon, thus making this game one of the best action adventure games you could ever spend your time playing.  The freeflow combat system that was so satisfying the first time around has been majorly upgraded and now features an impressive amount of ways to stun and cripple whoever dares to stand in your way. Batman\\'s collection of gadgets has also been expanded, with each one having applications in combat and puzzle-solving scenarios. Predator encounters have also seen a boost in excitement as there are now a more ways to takedown your foes, but also more ways to be caught by them. The addition of more playable characters is also a great benefit, as each one plays slightly differently, yet consistently satisfyingly.  You will also find yourself fighting a larger variety enemies this time around too, as the game introduces deadlier foes like snipers, armored goons, and blade wielding ninjas. And even more exciting is the larger variety of super villains that you'll find yourself at odds, and sometimes evens, with. A large portion of Batman's rogues gallery is on display here and the ways in which you\\'ll face these enemies are as varied as they thrilling. Sometimes there will be a complex and intense battle that must be fought with hard fists, while other times a sharp detective\\'s mind and keen puzzle-solving skills will be needed.  The most obvious expansion to the game is of course its world design. Whereas Arkham Asylum saw you making your way through the interesting and somewhat linear titular location, Arkham City sees you gliding through the snow covered streets of Gotham City itself, or at least a decent portion of it. It is amazingly detailed and diverse in its depiction and thanks to all the riddles that need solving, those who wish to explore it will be rewarded with interesting stories that give each location, as well as the entire game\\'s story, an impressive amount of context.  And when speaking about the story I wish to say is that this one\\'s is excellent. It starts with a flawless beginning that doesn\\'t directly follow Arkham Asylum\\'s ending, but provides enough information that you feel as though it almost does. This level of excellence then continues all the way through to the end of the main story, finishes off with quite the show. The characters, from the good to the bad, are each compelling in their own right and even though it\\'s satisfying to be victorious over them, it\\'s usually a bittersweet victory because your experience with them is over. Throw in the fact that Catwoman has her own separate storyline that weaves in and out of the main one, and you\\'ve got a narrative that is varied in its perspective and tone. My only true gripe is that there isn\\'t a concluding story moment that plays out once you\\'ve completed every task that you can do. You\\'re just left to free roam the map, wondering what to do with yourself. However there is an epilogue chapter which heavily features Robin, and while its inclusion does help relieve some feelings of story abandonment, it ultimately still leaves you wanting more.  Batman Arkham City is simply put, a major advancement, in almost every way over its predecessor. Almost every functioning part of this game has been improved from the previous Arkham game, and it is undeniably apparent. It is also obvious that huge amount of hard work and reverence for the Dark Knight that went it to creating this game. And in total, I truly believe it to be a work of interactive art.",

            "review_text": "This game is one of the best AAA of 2012 and I recommend anyone to play this game. Rocksteady really delivered all that they could with this game and it's certainly a step up from their last game Batman: Arkham Asylum. The controls are amazingly comfortable and it this Arkham City makes me oftenly think about Just Cause 2 in a way. The voice acting is phenominal, especially Mark Hamill as The Joker and Kevin Conroy as Batman. Every time I read the Batman comics those are exact voices I wanna hear from these characters and that is what this game does so perfectly. The open world plays in North Gothem and it's closed off from the rest of the city.   The open world aspect to this game is also very nice and detailed. The combat feels and looks amazing and I believe that their are hundreds of different fighting animations and it doesn't make it all looks too repetetive. Another thing that makes this game more creative are the gadgets. You need think of how to open or do certain things with these gadgets. If you're a mega fan of Batman, you might enjoy this game a tiny bit more than if you didn't. Fan or not, buy this game, you'll have a blast. It's sort of hard to point out the negatives but one of them is some of the random texture popins but it doesn't really bother me. I think one of the things is that you can spam press the counter attack button and Batman will fight for you. I'd give it a 9/10",

I'm taken by the gliding and grappling, as well as the endless array of familiar (and startling!) Batman villains that show up, either for entire levels, or just for a brief cameo. The combat remains untaintedly enjoyable, though maybe the arsenal of new gadgets makes things a bit too complex, and the stealth is a fantastic mix of power fantasy and powerless tension. It's pretty much the best sort of modern sequel you can hope for, adding and refining the formula that worked so well in Arkham Asylum. It's lost the balance that made Asylum a true modern classic, though, which is a bit of a shame, but it's not to City's detriment, by any stretch.",

There's a lot to say about Batman AC. What grabs your attention almost right away is the amazing scenery along with the incredibly well done voice acting to all different characters within the game. As a result of that, you bond a strange relationship with both the hero and the villains in AC.  Another rare (to me) and fantastic thing about this game is the combat system. The combat mechanics runs extremely smooth and it's tons of different things you can do in different situations; Long story short, the combat varies a great deal. Another important thing to point out is the stealth and how it works. There's loads of things you can do once you enter stealth and start sneaking around. This includes sneaking past enemies to get to your objective faster, taking 'em down one by one by taking a good hold around their neck and tighten enough to squeeze out the oxygen of their lifeless bodies or you can just simply creep around in Arkham City, listening to what the different gangmembers has to say about the weather, their annoying boss or the infamous Batman. I find that very amusing for some reason.  Last thing that I can recall at this very moment that's worth mentioning is the well written plot of both the main story and most side quests. I hope the writers of this gem got a salary raise 'cause the main story along with all the side quests are truly fascinating and well writen, therefore it engages the player to do whatever he/she can do to complete the task or whatever the player's being told.  In conclusion, Batman Arkham City is a marvelous game, I have to say I've never played any other game with better voice acting than this, the same goes for plot and story. Owing to that, Batman Arkham City won 'Game of the Year' and it truly deserves it. 10/10.  TL;DR - It's a good game.",

A decent lengthen storyline with plenty of side missions and DLC story lines too. - Missions are varied, both within the storyline and side missions, including puzzles, stealth, gung-ho action and boss battles. - For the first time you can play as Catwoman and Robin, the former is awesome to play as and adds a fresh dimension to the game. - The storyline is great, thanks to incredible characters with superb voice acting and twists and turns to keep you guessing. - Roam the city, it feels great to glide around Arkham city with plenty to explore. - Combat is some of the best in the industry with some new moves and use of gadgets. - Batman, Robin, Catwoma, Joker, Harley Quinn, Bane, Mr.Freeze, Penguin..so many of the great comic book legends come to life in the game. - GOTY edition comes with all content including some rather cool skin packs for Batman and Robin.  CONS: - On first play through on other platforms I found it easy to lose interest when wondering arkham city, often getting lost and mislead when navigating. I preferred Asylums more linear approach for a long time before I revisited arkham city. - Game mode plus, I hate this invention. Theres plenty of replay value anyway due to free roam after story completion, allowing you to revisit side missions but plus mode feels like a con. If there is an even more difficult mode have it available from the start as if your one to play for achievements you will need to play the game again.  VERDICT?  An incredible game which is high value for money.",

            "review_text": "Before I start this review, I would like to note that I REALLY reccomend this game. I got it last week and I have about 24 hours in it already. One of the best games I have played by far. Onto the review!   Batman: Arkham City is a 3rd Person Beat 'em Up game. Of course, there are more aspects to this game as well, such as the stealth, and the detective work. When you start out this game, you are shoved into Arkham City, a walled-off section of Gotham City that houses all of Gotham's dangerous criminals. The person behind this 'Arkham City', Hugo Strange, has a plan labelled 'Protocol 10', which Batman seems to be very suspicious of, and for good reason. Now, enough story, how does this game play? Well, first off, there is no jump button, something that I am used to, as I have played many tLoZ games, but that's not what we're talking about. Instead, there's a 'run' button, which is space. You can run off of buildings and ledges and the game will make you jump then. That is the most obvious difference from other 3rd person games. Getting around Arkham City is quite easy, as you can grapple to far away buildings and ledges, and you can upgrade this ablility so that it allows you to get launched quite a ways from where you intended to grapple. The combat system is AMAZING, you could jump into a group of enemies, and take them all out because of how it works. It's really only a 2 button system, with the attack and counter button, but it works so well! I could keep going on and on about the positives of this game, but it'd be pointless. It took me about 10 hours to get through the main campaign on normal mode, and I'm replaying it on the hardest difficulty. There are sidequests and end-game DLC to keep you playing after the main campaign, and there are challenges you could do, such as taking out a group of enemies using stealth, or just jumping in and beating them up, there's so much to do. My only complaint is that there are waaaaay too many Riddler Trophies to get, and 100%-ing the game will take much more time. But that is just one complaint in a game full of positives, so I give this game a 9.5/10.",

            "review_text": "[SPOILERS IN STORY SECTION, READ AT YOUR OWN RISK.] [PRECAUTION: IâVE PLAYED ~80% OF THE CAMPAIGN, NO ENDING SPOILERS]  INTRO: Arkham City is a game many have acclaimed, and it is near what I would call classic status, not only in it's presentation, but also in how it was able to hold up its legacy as 'the big sequel' to one of the best superhero games to have ever come out at that time, redefining the idea of superheroes in gaming by a long shot, to the point now where it seems soon that near any video game character in some way - aspires to be Batman. But does that mean it holds up against its rivals of today? In Arkham City, there are four main styles of play you alternate between throughout the campaign, that being hand-to-hand combat, stealth 'Predator' sections, Boss Battles, and creative puzzle solving. It is your position on these that will make or break your feelings toward Batman: AC.  HAND-TO-HAND: 8/10 ACâs unarmed combat is where I could praise the game for days. While some argue that the combat system from the previous Arkham games was too easy or âbutton-mashing,â I truly felt like I was the Caped Crusader, beating up floor thugs throughout the city. While at the start of the game, the melee combat was easy to the point of the game, once through about half way, new enemy types and combo availability provide plenty of challenge, and on the harder sections will require a few restarts to complete. I personally remember on one of the final boss fights I had dealt with all the normal enemies and was up against one of the main villains, And two-different types of his special thugs in an area with environmental hazards, being so close to winning, only to miss a key dodge and get hacked to the ground, blade in my side. It brought a bit of anger, but after playing again, it was honestly thrilling to finally get past that stage, rewarding even. If I had to describe ACâs hand-to-hand briefly, it is a fighting game turned 3D, with animations fluid enough to feel the rhythm and timing of each punch.  STEALTH SECTIONS: 4/10 Personally, the stealth seems as if Hitman: Absolution was given the express task of picking of each guard, one by one. Stealth combat places you in large scale rooms with multiple armed guards and different take-down abilities at your disposal. It is quite satisfying, but the issue I had with the stealth is that is punished the player too hard for being caught. Unlike Absolution, where if a mishap occurred, 47 could neutralize the threat and hide away for a bit. This isnât the case for Batman, where if a guard spots you, he will start shooting, and all enemies in the room will instantly know of your position. AC fails at the basic concept to make a stealth game good; have a delay between getting seen and alarms being sounded. This isnât assisted by the fact that the enemies have new equipment at would I would call too steep a curve, without Batman getting the abilities needed to counter them, without a maxed skill tree that is. Due to this, stealth fails would leave me much more angered than any other part, as at times it felt nothing like skill that placed me in that situation. Sub-par.  BOSS BATTLES: 7/10 Boss Battles, as well as mini-bosses are numerous and varied throughout AC, providing a refreshing brake through a near-binary style of play otherwise. Without spoilers, I can say some boss battles were exhilarating, while others were literally giving me chills down my spine wondering what attack I can use to defeat them. Excellent characters to use for a AAA title, showing The Dark Knights worst of enemies while still able to stay close enough to common known lore for a person whoâs not a die-hard Batman fan. These bosses and characters have made me much more interested in Batman lore, and were extremely fun to fight.  PUZZLE SOLVING: 6/10 The Puzzles within AC, for the most part, werenât excruciating nor exciting, and while Batmanâs utility belt was entertaining to use his various gadgets, I never looked forward to them and at times, they honestly felt like filler content. Nothing experience ruining, but certainly nothing to ride home about.  STORY SUMMARY: 7.5/10  The AC story centers around Bruce Wayne being captured by Hugo Strange. Strange, who knows Wayneâs secret identity, traps Wayne inside the new Arkham City, where part of Gotham has been locked off specifically for criminals. As Batman travels through, struggling to discover what the mysterious âProtocol 10â Strange speaks of is, he encounters iconic villains in campaign goals and side quests, such as: CatWoman, Two-Face, Harley Quinn, Mr. Freeze, The Riddler, Victor Zsasz, The Penguin, Poison Ivy, Raâs al Ghul, the Mad Hatter and none other than the Prince of Chaos, The Joker, played by Mark Hamill, who I may add, had a stellar performance. Early into the story, it is discovered that Joker has become terminally ill from exposure to a drug called Titan, and that Joker has been shipping out his blood to many Gotham hospitals in an attempt to kill innocent civilians from within Arkhamâs Walls. This also becomes a main point in the story, as Joker as knocked Batman unconscious, only to inject some of his blood into the Bat, giving him the same destructive effects as Joker. This urgency is the main driving force of the plot, causing Batman to go from everything to working alongside Mr. Freeze, to fooling Ghul into believing he truly wants to be his successor and become immortal.  If I could comment on the story, it would be that even though it does follow one arching plot-line, it feels too stuttered and apart to be considered great. Thereâs nothing wrong with it, but it isnât the best story of all time, not even the best story-line of recent superhero fiction, even for itâs era.  FINAL VERDICT: 8/10 Although there were sections I absolutely dreaded, I can safely say that 1. I enjoyed Arkham City, even if just for the melee combat, and 2. I canât think of a single superhero game that Iâve played, that was better. AC is a great sequel, I would recommend for any lover of Batman, or 3rd person combat.",

If I had any gripe it's that some of the combo moves are more difficult on the PC with the use of keys but there are so many extremely good things about this game it pales.  The game play is so intense I actually had minor vertigo when climbing up high in one of the scenes! The main story line is long enough to seem like an actual full story but short enough that I managed to complete it &amp; I'm often lead off course by side missions &amp; rarely complete the main story 1st so the fact I finished it should say something. Yet, I'm still playing the game regularly afterwards which should say more. Between the combat &amp; the predator modes there's literally 2 different play styles you can either 'snipe' or 'button mash' and progress either way.

The game essentially takes place at night, and the lighting looks great. It felt very immersive and I rarely felt like something was just a texture or polygon (a problem i have with most games i.e. Bioshock Infinite)  Gameplay is part fantastic brawler, and part stealth action. Traversing the open world is grappling and gliding (with some climbing if you feel like it); this system worked way better than i expected.  Brawling is smooth and can be difficult.  You have many gadgets at your disposal, and the stealth really makes you feel like the Bat. Swooping down at taking out a baddie, then 5 seconds later drop another enemy on the other side of the room really makes you feel powerful.   Even if you are powerful, Batman is far from invincible; guns do a lot of damage, so you have to plan each move. While you have a lot of gadgets, its all non-lethal, and the non-lethal aspect can make the game more difficult than other stealth games where you can just shoot baddies in the head from cover. The game makes you become Batman. It captures the essence of Batman more than i could have hoped.  Catwoman and others have their distance combat and movement styles, this keeps the game very interesting.  The only gripes i have: In one scene Batman is coughing, the same audio clip is played over and over. This like a minute of the game, a really minor detail. The other gripe is the line-launcher. Its a late-story gadget, and it can be very janky. After all the other gadgets doing what you want them to, the line-laucher can be finicky and i had to keep retrying a couple platforming parts.  Voice acting is great, story is great, open world is great, gameplay is great, graphics are great, music is great.

There's no such a way to say you're an AA titlle fan with Arkham City missing in your library.  Combined and bonded with a new introduced friendly combat system that is pretty easy to get on with, a never-seen before predator mode and comic-like riddle challenging storyline, an AA game just can never be that attractive, it made me dig into it with hours and hours and eventually even drowned into it, I can hardly pull myself back.  It is significant to say, if you're a lover of original Batman comic book, by playing the game within, you should by now notice what amazing work Rocksteady had done with the vital part of the game, and how well they mastered the universe of the hero of Batman along with his epic opponents.  The driven-stroy made AC stands out of the crowd, and somehow, it made me feel this is also a true Batman movie suppose to be.    I personally believe a timeless game is: 'After 200 hours+ gameplay, I would not be tired of it, and instantly come back to enjoy it once more. After years and years pass by, there's nothing else could replace it in the throne of my heart. Arkham City is, the very few games that makes me feel this way.  It is 2 years now since it's first released, I did 2 walkthrough on PS3, and 1 more time on PC recently, I have to say, I still haven't quite finished it, and what's more? I found myself really enjoy it as if I have never played it before...can you believe it? :)   Batman Arkham City itself is immortal, it will last decades untill someone re-make it with advanced graphics using the modernest digital technology in the future.   Even if no one is doing so, the outstanding driven-story, multiple gameplay system, herotic comic characters, exquisite art design, epic soundtrack...oh, boy, they will last forever.  The only bad thing about this games is: 'There isn't anything bad about it at all'   P.S Arkham City Soundtrack Main theme still is the hottest soundtrack of all times in Itunes Store, AC Collector's Editions sell a lot each day on Amazon after it reaches its 'life-time', if it isn't a legend, what is it?

But Dr. Hugo Strange has other plans for Mr. Wayne, namely throwing him into Arkham City with shackles to tie loose ends. Once inside Arkham, Bruce Wayne finds his way to an airdrop with a batsuit sent by Alfred, his butler. He then takes matters into his own hands and clears the city himself.  The gameplay is honestly flawless, as per usual in this game series. Couple that with a nice lengthy storyline (14-16h) that builds upon the Batman universe and characters, such as Catwoman, Mr. Freeze, Bane, The Joker, and many more classic vilains.   I would highly recommend any Batman: Arkham X games, even if you're not a fan of Batman at all.

You'll find yourself wanting to know what comes next and who is really behind the launch of Arkham City.   The most important aspect of any game, however, is arguably the gameplay. To date I have seen very, very few games that offer such a fun and smooth combat system as presented by the Arkham games.

            "review_text": "Hey guys it has been a while now since Origins came out and I thought as BIIIG Fan I need to speak a few words. This game is worth buying but not at top mark value. The amount of bugs I encountered and continue to encounter while playing origins holds me back from really enjoying the game and getting into being the bat. If I hadnt been so hungry for the collectors edition and statue on console I would've waited for a sale. That aside, it is a great game with some pretty great moments.   When compared to the other two batman games I will say this, it does fall short in some areas, but also makes changes in others. The combat is MUCH more challenging in this one . However, the combat falls prey to the ever so counter intuitive design pitfalls and glitches . Many times I find myself frustrated with larger groups of enemies instead of excited as I was in the previous batman games. In the first two games when you see a large group of enemies you get a sense of challenge and a thrill to get that highscore. In this it becomes more of a pain in the butt 9 times out of 10. It does challenge you but when you fail it doesnt feel like it was your mistake it feels like somehting happened that shouldnt have. Not saying thats the case 100% of the time but none the less my point still stands.  All in all a great game but, it makes appreciate the first two and Rock Steady all the more. I see DLC coming out as well and I am very concerned and warn all of you about the fact they have not polished up all glitches in the current main game they have sold us. They ARE in deed working on it and ever 2-4 weeks ive seen a significant patch solving many issues and improving the experience.   Well besides the obvious pros and cons that was my feelings, review and experience with Batman Arkham Origins. Hope you have fun with it ! I know I did ;)",

Moreover, while some may miss the more Metroid-style approach of the last game,  Arkham City  at least makes sure that its open world is not a gimmick: traversing the map is a breeze (both literally and figuratively), while the side missions and amount of things to do are great both in quantity and quality. Last but not least,  Arkham City  shows how to do a strikingly impressive storytelling in a game form, another quality which it thankfully inherits from its esteemed predecessor.",

            "review_text": "If you told me 5+ years ago that a lesser-known studio under a massive publisher is making a triple-A comicbook hero game adaptation, I'd be a cynic.  2011, Batman:Arkham City was released, the sequel to the acclaimed Batman:Arkham Asylum developed by Rocksteady studios. While AA managed to exceed the expectations of cynics like me, being a really polished and solid game in itself, AC rose way up higher, being one of the most amazing games in recent memory. Or at least for me personally.  Arkham City, in essence, is Arkham Asylum with a massive open world, slightly better animations (e.g. no more cretins holding their heads when they're defeated, regardless of where you actually hurt them) and more polishes around its edges, It manages to keep the fantastic, fluid combat, excellent level design, atmospheric setting, incredible narrative and oh-so perfect voice acting. So much of this review has been said in my previous review of AA.  Combat in AC is satisfying as ever, but now with more awesome animations and more importantly, more gadgets and the introduction of freeflow gadgets. Freeflow gadgets basically allows you to incorporate your gadgets mid-combat more seamlessly which makes the variety of combos way more exciting. With the introduction of more gadgets comes more approaches in combat which plays a huge part in AC and is without a doubt, extremely fun to experiment with different gadgets in different combat situations.  Boss fights in AC are a major improvement from its predecessor. Each boss is almost perfectly depicted as their comicbook counterpart not only in terms of presentation, but also their method of combat. Bottom line, boss encounters are extremely fun and at times challenging, although some bosses rely alot on button mashing.  Stealth in AA relied a lot on the game's excellent level design and combat/gadgetry to a certain extent (ignoring the clumsy AI). AC manages to yet again, excel in the series' stealth aspect with even more incredible level designs and as said earlier, more gadgets which also are incorporable for stealthy approaches. If you are a fan of stealth games, I recommend playing the game on hard because more often than not when you have a multiple gun-armed men encounter, you are forced to approach them extremely stealthily as guns kill you fairly quick. IMO, stealth on hard in Arkham City is feels just as or even more rewarding than combat.  Talking about stealth, it is almost unignorable to talk about the clumsy AI. Whilst enemies patroling/covering area are sometimes very tight and challenging, it sometimes fails to notice you in obvious positions of their line of sight and I am also convinced they never look behind or above them (unless theyre using thermo). This most definitely needs work.  Presentation of the game is without a doubt a massive eye (and ear) candy. The world is grim, dark and quite large, managing to retain the gothic atmosphere of AA once again. AC manages to have an ungeneric world due to being able to not to use generic buildings or placing alike buildings very close to each other. Rocksteady manages to put a lot of easter eggs in the world pretty well with references to the comic book stories in the form of riddler challenges and sidemissions. There's one easter egg where if you go to crime alley within the game which really generates a ton of feels (personally), if you are getting this game, do not forget to check it out, this shows the amount of effort the devs put into the game.  The music is not only extremely good as well, but its placement within each scene is perfection, definitely worth checking out the soundtrack itself.   Voice acting, oh my god, Mark Hamill nails it down the ground yet again with his portrayal of Joker, alongside Kevin Conroy, Tara Strong and every other villain as well being quite possibly one of the best voice-acting crew in the history of gaming. This helps build a spot-on portrayal of each character which is already presented extremely well with each of their character models and great costume design.  Story-wise, a lot of reviews I've read mentions that AC isn's as strong as AA but I say otherwise. While I do agree some villains felt rather shoehorned into the story after much thought, my initial playthrough almost ignores this fact due to the game's undeniably spectacular narrative. AC's narrative played out extremely well and felt very much alike a blockbuster movie (perhaps maybe even comparable to Nolan's trilogy) as the scale felt grand as compared to AA. Overall, I felt that the story was pretty much one of the key selling points of the game (again, personally).  Well that pretty much covers all my opinions of the game. I admit I do have abit of a Batboner (ok not that small after all..) but whether or not you are a huge fan of Batman should not be taken to consideration if you are deciding whether or not to buy this game because personally, Batman:Arkham City is one of the best games in recent memory. Treat yourselves well by buying yourselves this incredible piece of entertainment.  Conclusion; a fantastic game with incredibly satisfying combat, rewardingly challenging stealth, a relatively large world with excellent world and level design, great atmosphere of grim ( and yet, epicness of being the caped crusader), perfect sound direction and composition, unforgettable characters with their spot-on impressions/models/costume and triple-A voice acting, great story and a wonderful narrative. Yes, this game is so good i ran out of unique positive reinforcement adjectives to use.   9.5/10 - Brings me wonders how TESV got goty instead of this.",

            "review_text": "The most highly-marketed feature of  Batman: Arkham City  is the replacement of the small, confined corridors of the previous game with an open-world setting. Ironically, this feature is also the worst aspect of the game, and one of the primary reasons that the sequel doesn't quite live up to Rocksteady Studios' previous effort.  One year after the events of  Arkham Asylum , Bruce Wayne is abducted and imprisoned within Arkham City, a controversial prison within a walled-off section of Gotham overseen by private security forces led by a mysterious villain named Hugo Strange, who makes it clear up-front that he knows Batman's true identity. It's almost comical how quickly things escalate, with Bruce Wayne being captured by the Penguin literally at the front gate of Arkham City. Weirdly enough, just about none of the game has anything to do with the initial problem of Batman's identity being revealed, and Hugo Strange himself only really comes into villainhood in the game's final act, with the majority of the game's runtime dedicated to the Joker - an infinitely more interesting villain that any of Batman's other enemies, most of whom are regulated to minor, almost tangential missions early in the game. In fact, a lot of the plot is actually just tangents, with the purpose of leading the player on a merry tour of the big, gloomy world that's been constructed. It's lacking in focus for the most part, with one very specific MacGuffin loosely tying everything together. For sure, the villains are still just as good as they were in  Arkham Asylum , and there are certainly more of them, but most of them are just minor acknowledgements of actual character, instead just displaying the characteristics for which they are most well-known. To make things even more dire on the story front, the game of the year edition incorporates the normally separate Catwoman DLC into the main story, spreading the missions throughout the game's length, serving only to completely break the flow of both the game and the DLC.  While the story's a bit of a mess this time around, the gameplay is pretty spot-on. Most of the new stuff that's been introduced is simple and easy to use, and in general the combat just flows a lot better, making for an even more delightful experience in kicking impoverished homeless people in the teeth. Even better, efforts have actually been made to stop Batman from being incredibly overpowered in stealth segments, with new gear that scrambles x-ray vision and sees long distances, even in the dark. The combat is still a lot more fun - it's fast and surprisingly tactical considering the entire premise is punching large quantities of men. The introductions of new enemy types has done a lot to keep it all fresh and challenging, especially in massive brawls involving weapons and the classic giant mutants from the original game. In short, while  Arkham City  is quite a bit worse on the story front, and it lacks the tight focus and thick atmosphere that shrouded  Arkham Asylum , though it makes up some lost ground with myriad gameplay and control improvements, coming together as a finished product that's overall worse than it's predecessor, but still a lot of fun.

Now in Batman Arkham City, everything is perfected: the combat, the gadgets, the story and the graphics. Arkham City has a loot of things to do, and if you never played any Batman Arkham games, arkham city is probably the best one of all and definitely deserves to be played (but it has some references to the events from Arkham asylum).  As you progress through the main story and gain more gadgets and upgrade your moves, the combat just keeps getting better and encourages you to try new moves, and use new gadgets in combat, and alongside that, the combat has some pretty badass moves, so its very hard to get tired of the combat in the game.  The predator (the stealth part of the game where you have to take out a certain number of armed enemies in a room) is also very enganging, because there is a lot of takedowns available, and some of them are hard to pull off and you get a sense of joy when you actually do it. Besides, knocking out an enemy through a wodden wall or performing an inverted takedown from a gargoyle simply never gets old!  The story is also very interesting, and captivating though some minor plot holes can be pointed out (and this is beeing nitpicking), but they don't affect the story.  Concluding, if you don't really like batman but think the game is cool, then go for it, you won't regret it (if you don't know a lot about comick books, the game explains every character in a menu that contains info about every character from the game). If you do like Batman also buy this game cause it's amazing  10 / 10 -&gt; spent a month acting and talking like batman to my friends and family... now i am alone....... i have the game though...",
