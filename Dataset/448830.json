            "review_text": "Eh, there's a lot of room for improvement. It's not terrible, but a lot of the sounds here definitely do not fit for ASMR, such as the car horn, the scream (?), and others (Though I suppose they can be useful for other creative needs).   Now, I feel the sounds are useful for general relaxation, but for the purpose of ASMR specifically, very few do the trick. This software does have quite a lot of potential though. I'd like to see it developed further, as I really do like the overall concept here.",

Simple Unity program, but so effective it's worth the price. The sound quality and customization extend its value.  Steam Workshop would be a welcome addition.",

There are very odd and not calming sounds on here such as barking dogs, sirens, loud bass, screaming, etc. The sounds that are calming have noticeable loops that disrupt the experience. I'm sure this could be a good program for some, but it wasn't for me.",
