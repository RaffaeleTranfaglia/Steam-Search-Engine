            "review_text": "What's so great about Infinity Wars?  1. It has simultaneous turns (which means, you and your opponent decide at the same time what to do, so it has much more pace than eg. MTG DOTP and triggers many more mind games)  2. It has different zones of play:  - Command (where you put the cards you build your deck around, also they define the pool of cards you can include in your deck)  - Support (where your creatures you just played are placed due to summoning sickness, you can also pull already in play creatures back to it in order to dodge spells affecting ATK and/or DEF zone)  - Attack and Defense (The two players decide at the same time, if they want to attack OR defend)   3. It has different modes:  - Infinite (you can play every card that has ever been 'printed')  - Ranked (it takes a while to be playable for a beginner, you play a best-of-three with a sideboard to get a better rank that provides special cards at the end of each season, also some cards are restricted) - Pauper (every card BELOW rare is allowed [there are common, uncommon, rare, epic and legendary]) - Draft (you pick one out of four cards 40 times [plus the command zone picks], it's not really recommendable for a start but incredible fun if you know the pool a bit)  4. Each day you get a reward for logging in and for playing three games (those can be common cards up to legendaries, it can be any card in game)  5. Every card is obtainable without spending any real money  6. The cards are like GIFs, with nice artwork and all do have an animation to admire  7. The new campaign mode provides many essential cards for further deck building for free just for crushing bots  8. It has a win option that eg MTG does not have: reducing the so-called Morale of the opponent. It has 100 points, just like the 'normal' health bar and can be reduced by killing enemy creatures.   9. Last but not least: the community is just great. I've played more than 1000 matches and i was insulted ONCE, true story. Also the Lightmare Forums are really recommended here, where people can exchange about eg. deck building, certain card mechanics and also are able to have direct contact with the Lightmare Staff, who always answer every single (yeah really) question [thx Teremus btw].    So.. What's actually bad about IW?  1. Cards obtained from Log In Reward or LVL UP boosters are not tradable. Only the ones you bought with IP (you also gain them by just playing fortunately) and the ones you won in draft. There is no forging system or else [yet].  2. There are some bugs sometimes, that can make one really angry tbh. But the LM staff is quite aware of those and does bug fixes regularly.  3. Cards you do not own yet are not displayed.   4. It can take some time to gain a booster from IP in the beginning.  5. The saddest point: the community is not that big yet. Though I'm quite sure the community will become bigger, because the game is just awesome and one can see the effort Lightmare puts into it.    Finally I have to say: for people who don't play TCGs usually: give it a try at least. It's obv the most exciting and challenging TCG there is atm (admittedly I never played Hex). For people playing MTG/HS or else: this game has a unique playstyle, it's more modern than MTG (you don't depend on drawing islands), it's more challenging than HS: join the community already, what are you waiting for? :D",

Pros: -Simultaneous turn which minimizes the downtime and brings a new layer of strategy planning. -Animated card and even playmat, some cards with transform and evo have more than 1 appearance. -Those cards purchased by in game currency and cash can be traded with other players. -Not pay 2 win: New player pre-set decks, draft mode (called rift run which is free for 1 time every 5 day, 3 loses to out), generous daily login gift, skills of deploying card can out play opponent.  -8 factions (not counting neutral) with its own characteristics to choose from, you can mix and match up to 3 of them. -Commander which determines your faction of deck, commander can use ability without playing the card or played to battlefield without waiting 1 turn which makes deciding the 3 commanders exciting. -With 5 expansions contribute to a card pool close to 1000, only few cards are not viable, including commons.  Cons: -The graphic is a bit old, maybe litmited by animation. -Only 4 factions' starter deck are provided for free, other start deck can only be purchased with cash.  -The deck builder shows the cards in a small scale, you need to move the mouse over the text sometimes. -A few bugs can be found, game crashing ones are rare though (only faced 2 times atm). -Easy to learn but very hard to master, this may frustrate new players. -Small player base which result in a little bit if waiting time for PVP.  -You may be confused if you missed single card interaction.",

Its easy to lvl up and get cards, generous rewards, dailys and all kinds of different gameplay mods. The game makes full use of it being digital, it has insane combos and card mechanics that wouldnt be possible in the real world and that I heavent seen being used in other TCG´s. Adding on top of that the turns are taken simultaneously wich adds another layer of strategy on top of your normal card game mechanics. If you like card games with deep strategy and lots of options this is the game for you.",

            "review_text": "I've been playing Infinity Wars for about a week and 34 hours already! Can't even help myself. My first card game was Pokemon but let's face it, they just looked pretty. The game sucked. Yu-Gi-Oh! is first love But Konami killed it a while ago. The only way I've been able to get my card game fix is playing old GBA/Vita games. I played Magic for about a year. The game is deep and I respect the hell out of it but the lore didn't grab me. I didn't find myself invested in the cards. Hearthstone is fun but I needed something deeper. This game caught my attention a while ago but my Steam back list for games is..I'm sure you know all too well. It's a free to play game but I saw the content on sale so I decided to check it out to see if it was worth it. First of all, it is definitely not pay to win. It's git gud to win. A week in and you get a lot of cards through campaign mode and leveling u. I lucked out because I got some pretty awesome rare and epic cards. I've been getting better at deck building. I was getting my ♥♥♥ kicked this morning and then I threw a deck together with the few factionless cards I have. I didn't have enough to make a factionless deck, so I combined it with the Dawn faction (or whatever its called) Took it for a test run, it drained my morale. I keep forgetting about morale. So I combine it with Genesis. Low morale costs and power up items. I am 7-2 with this deck as of now. My first lost taught me how to use the deck better. The 2nd loss showed me that I need more cards for this build. But still not bad for using cards given to you for free.  But tomorrow is pay day and I'm definitely giving this game my money. I can already see myself putting 1000s of hours in. Some people say the content is over priced. But they put in all the hard work and released the game for free. Given you a method to play competitively without spending a dime. Even if you lose you still level up and get points. They have every right to price their content at whatever they like. I'm buying all of the items on sale but I'm buying 1 at full price. I think it's completely worth it for all the time I know I will put in it. But it will be the one and only time. After this I'm waiting for sales to come around again.",

You can actually use some strategy and tactics while in battle insetad of just rolling the dice on whos got better draw like it was in the other game where first turns draws dictated the fate of boring, childlish battle with no spin and tactics to it whatsoever. Im not a hardcore card gamer but playing this after hearthstone is awesome. You get more controll over the battle, more choices, more options to do with cards in yoru hand insetad of simple 'use or hold and see what happens'.  I definitely recommend you to try it out.

Do you pull a deffensive stance and let the moral of your opponents fall? Do you summon hordes of troops, rally, and charge into battle? Do you, summon your opponents graveyard and destroy them?  All I can say is, it's free, it's expansive, and it's fun. The game has been out for a bit, but litterally just hit Steam. Give it a chance.  8/10",

It requires a lot of bluffing and high level of skill in ranked play and also because the game became popular recently building your own deck is the choice... you ask why not to just copy someone others? The answer is: The game is new and people still haven't developed top 10 deck or something and the game has a lot to  offer about deck building opportunities! And one more thing is tremendously fun to play this game with friends because you talk with them and play at the same time and start bluffing a lot more and have hilarious moments!

            "review_text": "I started playing infinity wars late 2014 after ascension came out, up until the release of oppression on june 2015.  I also play mtg, so I can compare them a bit.  Infinity Wars has simultaneous turns, this makes it so you not only need to have the desired card ready, you also have to time it well. Let's say you have a boardwipe. Your opponent can move his character cards to a safe zone to keep them out of reach. Though if he does so, he won't be able to attack or block that turn. This way the game puts a lot of emphasis on decision making and prediction. Thanks to this, the pace of the game is a lot faster and games aren't decided by a single hoser. It makes games excited, because they can swing in either players favour up until the very last turn.  Second difference. Infinity Wars has no lands, no mana and thus doesn't screw you over because you're drawing the wrong half of your deck. Both players gain resources that increase by 1 every turn. So on turn 2 you can always play a 2 cost spell and on turn 10 always a 10 cost if you have one in your hand.  Cards are tradable. Last time I checked, the trade window leaves a lot to be desired. The card filters and server connection to other players was pretty buggy. An auction house would've been better, but trading as it is does work and I've done a lot of it.   Is it pay2win? This one is hard to answer for me personally, because I haven't played it in a long time and they increased the rewards and lowered the prices on boosterpacks. It's a card game and almost every card game requires you to invest time and/or money into it. Completing the campaign rewards you with free decks that consist of good cards, there are daily missions and rewards that do the same. Cards became a whole lot more accessible for new players, but also hit the economy in the game pretty hard, which I don't think is a good idea for the health of the game in the long term.  Other things I like/dislike about the game: - The art is great. It's a bit of a comic book style. All artwork is animated which really adds to the game's emersion. - It's a digital card game, so the developers get to change already released cards sometimes. There have been a lot of major staples that all prove to be too powerful, but were left unchecked for too long, so the legacy status they gained has now fallen to the wayside, which ultimately had me take a break from the game. The game felt kinda dumbed down at that point, but hopefully the new set Rebellion will breath some new life into the game after over a year now. - The playerbase is great. It has shrinked tremendously though, which is a real problem right now, but the Infinity Wars community is the best gaming community I ever felt like being a part of. - Updates and communication. I have to touch on this real quick. The devs need to put more effort into keeping the playerbase up to date on what they're working on. The gaps of silence between updates continue to grow, which has proven to be very bad for the health of the game.",

If you are tired of the simplicity and repetitiveness of meta card games like Hearthstone and MTG, then this might be the breath of fresh air you are looking for. Infinity Wars' mechanics are complex, it will take you a couple hours to get used to how some abilities work, and how the board layout works. The way you play and how you play are unique to IW, and I love it. I've played a lot of hearthstone and I've seen a lot of the same decks OVER AND OVER AND OVER again. This game will not do that, at least not to the extent of other games. Every strong deck archetype has a counter, and each archetype can be played in different ways.   The mental game is also unlike any other card game. Guessing what your opponent will do with what he has in play is a big part of being good at IW, and I think that is a huge plus and adds a lot to the game.",

It has many innovative features and in a lot of ways it is the best digital TCG out there (though it has some shortcomings). Why do I believe this?  - All the cards have animated art! Yep, you heard that right. This gives the game an aesthetic value and beauty that is unmatched by most other digital tcg's. Some of these cards have full animations!  - The tactical depth of this game blows away all other TCG's. You have a support zone, assault zone, defense zone, and command zone. It's easy to get used to and allows for a lot of tactical depth. If Hearthstone is checkers, this is chess.  - The factions are cool, cards have a lot of flavor, there are custom battlegrounds, card backs, avatars, and card effects you can purchase. But it is NOT pay to win. You can unlock packs pretty easily without spending a dime; trust me, I didn't spend any money for a very long time. But eventually I started to spend money on some of the preorders when new sets were released.   - Yes, you can actually trade cards with other people so it is a true TCG.  - The draft format is fun and doesn't cost a lot of points. And yes, you can buy in using Infinity Points that you earn in the game so once again - you don't have to spend money.  - There are ranking systems, prizes, etc.    Some of the Downfalls:  - It needs more players so I'm hoping this new release draws in a new audience.  - There were bugs from time to time in the past, though ever since a new company bought the game, I haven't run into any more bugs. So this seems improved.    Conclusion:   This is an amazing game. Play it, get a couple of your friends to play it, and help it blossom. There is real potential here. ",

NOTHING of what those reviews said was true after trying the game. I don't know if they changed something, but it's just a week I play and I have 400+ cards just by playing the campaign and logging in.  I receive free cards every day for logging and another for playing 3 games in any mode.  Plus I can even sometime win against ranked veterans with just a week of playing under my hood. Granted there are great decks and players out there that can blast me away, but is more a matter of experience and missing maybe some card here and there.  Plus there is the fact you can even play legendary free decks that they put up every week on rotation, and even if you don't have enough cards those decks are good and also train you to new strategies and combos and explain you new cards.  So, don't let those old negative reviews discourage you, the game is completely playable FOR FREE, and you can become pretty competitive given a bit of time (not too much too!). The game is fun also, very interesting factions and strategies, different ways to win, a lot of sinergies and different decks variants.  I played Hearthstone, Hex, magic and none stands up to IW.

I'd never heard about this until it popped up in my 'reccomended for you' section, and I am super glad I downloaded it.  Infinity Wars is a digital TCG where every card is animated and have many cool mechanics. The mechanics involve similar tropes to what you've seen in other TCG's, but what sets IW apart is it's gameplay where players take their turns simultaneously and then have the turns resolved to see who was able to 'predict' their opponents mathups better. It's difficult to explain without actually playing the game, and you will probably be destroyed several times before you even feel like you're making progress. But when you do manage to beat somebody, oh boy does it feel good. The sense of accomplishment is huge and makes me want to keep playing forever. With several modes of cinstructed to the Hearthstone-Arena-type draft, there is something for everbody.  Now, there are a few drawbacks to the game, but the devs appear to be doing a good job of getting things ironed out and making the experience better and better. You will occasionally have a few graphical glitches when trying to view cards, like words from the previous screen you were on popping through, and a couple small minor things, but those are not very major and can be easily looked past IMO. The biggest drawback you may find is the amount of people that play the game is fairly small, so it can be difficult for new players like myself to get involved in the game because we get destroyed by those who are better than us.  Overall, this game was a hugely pleasant surprise for me, I'm gald I decided to play it. I can truly say that it puts Hearthstone to shame",

Zombie robots, Sci-fi Warrior stuff etc. The card animation stuff is really nice too.  Unique fractions &amp; Mechanics - A lot of the fractions can end up playing quite differently and the varriation of cards allows for a lot of different decks and plays.  Cons:  Kind of expensive &amp; grindy to get cards. I wish working toward getting cards was more fun. I think there is a lot they could do here. Making trading easier would even help a lot. Right now it feels like you have to wait forever to maybe get one new useful card, or throw quite a bit of money at it.  Too varried in terms of decks and play styles you can end up with decks that are too specialized or you need to know the trick to beating them.

Even if just one of the three appeals to you, the game is worth a try, as even casual play is rewarding and the game is comparably (to the F2P standard) generous with its free rewards. You can get boosters for ingame currency and levelling up also grants you a free soulbound booster. Not to mention logging in and playing 3 games per day awards a free card each,  At this point you might be wondering: will the game be worth a play if you want to stay free and not spend anything on it? The answer is yes, many of the most powerful and useful cards are of low rarity, with the exception of a few decks it is rare to see a deck filled with high rarity cards. This along with the ease of earning new ones and the ability to trade makes it fairly easy to get a decent deck running once you've gotten familiar with the game.  As for negatives: the game has bugs, owing to the limitations of the developers. They vary in severity with an occasional desync bug even capable of ruining a game, others merely being a nuissance (naccurate card text, a button name giving an error message) or causing unexpected card interaction, although these cases seem the exception rather than a rule by my experience.  All in all the game feels like an unpolished gem. It has a great core, fun gameplay, variety of choice in deck creation, but is held back by bugs and what seems to be a limitation of dev resources.",

Proper deck building takes intelligence, as well as playing a great match, it's not a game for the dumb.

That being said I've put nothing in and spent 6 hours or so playing and here are my thoughts  Artwork: Not MTG lvl, but really that'd be asking a lot from a non wizard TCG so fairly standard but lots of use of colors, its nice. Card spending: Its more streamlined than MTG, hell everything is and yes the review is gonna go around MTG as sort of the top of TCG...why...well because it is and if you think otherwise, you're most likely wrong. No mana to tap, get resources which increase per turn, spend them to summon cards, magic, abilities Card range: Pretty normal variety: Creatures, abilities, location, artifacts sooooo yeah normal Depth of Game: I'd rank it above Hearthstone which to me is about as casual you get without the game being a bore and lets say Yugioh. There is enough variety and ability to make mixed decks and them be functional (often better) and some strategy based on who you are playing. Generals: So purity is a deciding factor on generals, some cards require two gens from that card type, some 1, some all 3 gens must be of that type this both limits and creates variety in gameplay as the gens you pick can have a huge impact on ramping up bigger high dmg cards  Where the game excels? Draft mode, which is one of two modes players get ranked; which is the most just system of ranking possible, the draft mode however is slow as frak to set up due to load times and revamps due to crap generals. But money doesn't matter in draft, it won't help you win so balanced pvp existing in a computer TCG? Yeah that's a major win in my book  Oh rights: HP and Moral, two ways to win/lose. If either (both start at 100) hit zero its game over, but unlike many games where zero cards in deck means gameover Infinity War lets you keep playing with a 'dead' deck for a lose of 10 morale per turn. Shot clock which frankly not a bad way to manage it  Lacks: A decent RFP, its there and its okay but it feels really limited and return from graveyard is barely there at all, more fill the grave then empty it",

Although basic cards can be received from playing the campaign and finishing quests, they are not enough to be able to compete with the higher level/older players. This becomes a bigger problem due to a seemingly broken matchmaking system. It's either a few players are playing or bad matchmaking since a player can get paired up with a high-ranking/veteran player, which can demoralize a player.  Sure you can say that when playing the game more, you earn in-game currency to buy booster packs/decks, but it is not enough to actually bring the new player to compete or at least have a chance. For example, a VICTORY gives only 150 IP tops but not guaranteed, while a booster pack costs 5250 IP, which means a required minimum of 35 wins. Decks, on the other hand, cost 12,950 IP, which reuires a minimum of 87 wins with maximum IP gained. Considering loses only give ~50 IP and new players rarely having good cards, it makes the game into a grind of a sort. Of course, there is the last resort of actually purchasing cards with real money for those who want to support the game. With the low amount of IP gained per match and expensive cost of card packs/decks, the game seems to tell players to 'buy or suffer grind.'  I'd recommend the game since it shows promise, but due to the current system it may dismay some players.",

            "review_text": "Very uneven TCG.  On the positive side lie the mechanics and card design. Developers used clever solutions to reduce influence of rendomness on the results of a game and introduce a high skill ceiling.   Command zone mechanic makes decks much more consistent. This diminishes dependance of having good draws and puts more emphasis on deck construction. Meanwhile, the way targetting works with different zones of play leaves a lot of space for bluffing, mind games and outsmarting the opponent. Finally mechanics are rich and complex, allowing for variety of strange, powerful and sometimes even silly combos.  Another strong point is the art quality. As always, there are some hits and misses, but the style chosen by creators works well. Also, each card is animated and while some of animations are very simple (say, a billowing cloak on a static character), some cards are short animated stories in an of themselves (Give Him a Jetpack taking a cake in this category).  All of the above makes for a card game that, in my opinion, is much more satisfying than the biggest F2P TCG at the moment, that is Hearthstone.  The negatives are mostly of technical nature. From time to time strange bugs crop out, servers can be problematic and functionality of client is debatable. Interface works passably well, but is not the most comfortable. Deck building window and trade window spring to mind as examples of less than stellar when it comes to quality of use.  Also, the in-game economy may be unwelcome for some. Trading cards is a staple of the genre, but ability to craft a card that one requires at the time is definitely convenient in comparison to looking for someone who both has it and wants anything of what you want to trade. Infinity Wars is however based purely on interplayer trade in that regard (and of course purchasing boosters for either in game currency or cash). This can be either positive or negative, depending on preferance.  I still recommend the game, since positives outweight the negatives by a large margin and it is worth giving it a try.",

However, the game has a ridiculous amount of free cards available and they are actually so easy to earn that its not even like you are grinding them out. Every Level you get at least one pack.

Original review follows:  Months and months with the new devs, and a ridiculous amount of issues persist:     Dozens of bugs, many of them game-breaking - including wins and losses not registering in ranked play.     Extremely limited draft pool, majority of cards need heavy balancing and are restricted from draft.     Long ranked queues are only getting longer, constant matches against the same players - no matter how many are online.     Even when the devs try to fix something, it rarely works. Such as the three cards 'removed' from ranked a few weeks ago that still pop up.   New dev team seems more interested in putting out new sets, DLC, and (for who knows what reason) tournaments for the ~150 playerbase. Too bad, because this game could be great... and it never will be. Seriously, they've patched all of three bugs since the beginning of the year. Don't waste your time (and money) like I did.",

Finnaly (for the positives, atleast), the command zone gives decks a huge boost of consistancy while also letting certain factions (Exiles and Cult of Verore come to mind) disrupt decks easily via removal that can target the command. It opens up a huge avenue for strategic gameplay.  What I dislike it the catering to specific playstyles. Since first picking up the game a while back, I have seen the developers systematically remove control options, especially for my favorite faction: Descendants of Dragon. Their defensive playstyle and alt wincons have been attacked again and again, as has the standard control faction: Cult of Verore. Meanwhile the rush factions, like Order of Solace and FlameDawn have seen nothing but buffs.  Overall, I think that if Lightmare had treated all playstyles equally, I would be playing Infinity Wars instead of writing this comment.

Most likely they just hired low cost voice over people from the internet, and each one is using a different standard of equipment. Acting is also sub par. I would have rather had no voices that distracting, low quality voices. Additionally, there are various typos throughout the system. The most obvious one I saw was the word 'availiable' (yes, with two 'i's) in the opening tutorial. Nice.  On to game play, I'm a long time TCG player of various games, and this one is just a cheap knock off of Hearthstone, which is already a fairly boring game for those who are used to more complex and exciting games like MTG. Game play itself is marred by a very confusing turn system (which is unexplained and un-intuitive to new comers). I found myself stuck on the tutorial level where it says 'attack with all' and there is simply no button that says 'attack' or 'proceed' or 'go'. The fact that I have to carefully scan the screen for several minutes, check the options menu, and finally just give up shows a complete failure in this aspect.  It's pretty clear the developers here only cared for making shiny graphics and animations, and cared nothing for the audio, the user interface, or even proper spelling.",

Not fixing bugs, starting tournaments for a small player base, and upping prices as it goes on, it just seems to be falling apart.  If you like strategy and/or card games, keep your eye on it.

Don't be mistaken, this game is absolutely pay-to-win, and worst off, its pay-to-win in a game with a playerbase in the hundreds. If you spend money on booster/decks/singles, you will have an advantage over non-paying players. That is pay-to-win in my book. Granted, it isn't pay-to-play.   There are ways for non-paying players to earn packs (5250 IP for a pack, you gain 150 IP per 5 minute win, 75 for a 5 minute loss. That means anywhere between 30-40 games for 15 cards. Did I also mention that there are 9 factions (colors/classes)? So yeah, good luck building a deck in a short amount of time without spending money.  I would have enjoyed this game a lot more if it were still Early Access, but this game has been out for 2+ years and still has many problems.  Card interactions are buggy and the text isn't standardized across cards. Morale values are not balanced, and card costs/purities aren't balanced either. Many games end because of bugs or because it is just a death race or a coin flip. There is some strategy there, but the results often boil down to luck because of the simultaneous turns. You'll find yourself in draws very often.  There are also so many board wipes, its ridiculous. Wrath of God/Armageddon used to mean something, but in IW prepare for Mass Death, Heat Wave, Yuanshi's Wrath, The Calamity, Shikana, MU, the list goes on. There are many many cards capable of clearing the board of all creatures, and many decks built around those cards.  Low playerbase, no matchmaking system, so newbies are forced to play against pros, wasting their currency (it costs 1000 IP to enter a draft -- if you lose 3 games you're out). There are separate queues for ranked/unranked but its meaningless because you don't get anything for playing ranked. The only reason to play unranked is for the EXP and the only reason to get EXP is for the cards (assuming you're non-paying). So you have to grind this treadmill for weeks just to be able to play the game in a meaningful way if you don't want to pay money to a game that is basically still in beta, but released for the public.  TL;DR: Just another Pay-2-Win card game with lower playerbase than other games and worse player incentives. The reward structure will make you scratch your head, as the game itself is a bit of fun, but the MMO treadmill they expect us to run is ridiculous.",

            "review_text": "TL;DR Good concept and potential, but nagging problems prevent it from being good  Infinity Wars has a lot of innovative ideas: the command system, the different battlefield zones, players having both health and morale that they have to watch, but in the end the game is bogged down by a clunky progression system. It's very difficult to get new cards (two cards free per day, 3,000 IP (the free currency) for a booster pack, which takes a while to earn considering you only get a few hundred IP for a win, at most. Leveling is slow and eventually becomes a ceaseless grind at the higher levels, with no incentives or rewards other than getting a free pack every levelup (the game has 30 levels in all. I'm level 26) But the biggest problem isn't the price, it's the fact that the game offers no way to get rid of excess cards. You can include three copies of most cards at max in your deck, but the vagaries of luck and rarity have caused me to have over 10 of some common cards, and only one of others. As of this writing, I have 27 Wealthy Nobles. The game has no disenchant option, so the cards just sit there, effectively wasted IP. This also makes building your own deck difficult, as you can't get the cards you need.   I still think the game has potential and I would return if some of these things were fixed, but right now, I can't recommend it.",
