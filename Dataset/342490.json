            "review_text": "Shipwreck is emulating a very specific subgroup of Zelda games, that being the ones on the Game Boy and Game Boy Color.  It’s pretty neat how Shipwreck uses an aspect and tile ratio similar to Link’s Awakening for a new game. Unfortunately the gameplay here is worse than where it is borrowed from and Shipwreck has no mechanics that it can really call it’s own.  I respect what this game is trying to do. I’m just disappointed how little it actually does with it. I’m going keep my eye on Brushfire Games though. Making an homage game for something over 20 years old takes a certain kind of passion. There’s something here that might be pretty cool if there were a few iterations.",

It is very short, and there isn't much to the story. Beyond choosing weapons there aren't many of the standard rpg elements [skills].  However, even though it is short, the world that there is to explorer, in a pixel art style looks very nice, as sounds the accompanying music.  The game is not difficult in the slightest, and so makes for a good afternoon's playthrough.",

            "review_text": "Let me sum up my opinion of this game: it feels like someone watched someone else play Zelda and got entirely the wrong idea about what makes Legend of Zelda a good series. Legend of Zelda is, at its heart, about puzzles and exploration. This game is pretty much just about action. And what works for an action-puzzler doesn't work for a nearly pure action game.  The combat is fairly bland, run up and swing your sword. Being able to shield-bash enemies is sort of interesting, but overall it doesn't do much new. There are other weapons as well, but I admittedly lost interest towards the end of the first 'real' dungeon.  The puzzles are... well, honestly, they feel tacked on. They're mostly of the 'step on this switch, open that door' variety.  The exploration is non-existent. Oh, sure, you can go off the path, but you just wind up on a completely empty and useless screen. The game feels like it punishes exploration rather than rewarding it.  Overall:  Graphics: 9/10. Probably the only really good thing about this game.  Music: 6/10. Not really good, not really bad. This might be skewed down a bit due to me playing this game very shortly after finishing Undertale.  Story: 4/10. It's an excuse plot. Not the worst I've ever heard, but not the best either.  World: 0/10. Full of empty screens, and almost all of NPCs draw from the same dialogue pool. Even the NPCs that don't do so have very little personality. Makes it feel like talking to anyone or going anywhere is a waste of time. If the devs were going to do this, they might as well have just put all the dungeons directly adjacent to the town and made the NPCs unresponsive.  Gameplay (Action): 6/10. Decent, nothing to really write home about. The combat is basically identical to the old 2D Zelda games, except your shield and boomerang are fused together. Killing enemies is basically mindless busywork. The first boss was okay, the second boss is basically a more frustrating version of Moldorm that takes up an eighth of the screen and summons minions.  Gameplay (Puzzle): 2/10. The puzzles just aren't good and leave almost no impression.  Gameplay (Exploration): -3/10. Yes, negative three. The game passively punishes you for trying to explore by presenting you with empty dead ends and backtracking. The worst part is, there actually are two health-ups discovered by exploring. They're inside peoples' houses, but give the impression that maybe if you go down enough dead-ends you'll eventually find something interesting.  ---  Overall: 2/10  A quick note:  As I mentioned once or twice, I have not completed this game. Maybe it gets better towards the end, I wouldn't really know. However, I doubt the improvement is enough to warrant playing through the beginning of the game.   Some comments for the devs:  Don't be disheartened by this review. While I didn't like the game, it was well programmed and fairly well put together. It's clear that you guys are passionate about games, and even if this game wasn't great, it shows potential. It just maybe needed to be cooked a little longer before being pulled out of the oven. If you're looking to make a game like this in the future, here's some observations I've made about where I feel this game fell short and how to fix it (which is admittedly subjective, but no harm in mentioning it):  1. The most obvious issue is the lack of point to exploration. If you give a player an option to go somewhere, there should be something in that place, even if it's just an NPC saying 'why are you on the roof of my house?'. You clearly have a talent for good looking graphics; even including some interesting landmarks could be good. If I wander down a side-path and come to a dead end, my reaction would be a lot better if that dead end is the edge of a canyon looking down into a rushing ravine than if it's just a wall of the same trees that are everywhere else. That strategy tends to work better in 3D games than in 2D games, however, and I admit to still being frustrated upon going north from the village due to not being able to interact with the headstones or enter the windmill (mostly since I didn't know it was and wasn't expecting it to be the final dungeon). Honestly, the bit about the windmill could have been solved by putting a visible lock on the door, which would change it from an annoyance to an objective. In general, expect that a player will try to interact with anything that looks unusual, and will always go in every single direction except towards the main quest until there's no other option. If there's a way to leave the road, you can't just make the road pretty and ignore the places off the path.  2. The second most obvious issue is the NPCs. Generally speaking, it's better to create individual dialogues for each separate NPC. I'm not trying to be condescending, there are reasons to program global dialogue pools like the ones in your game. However, dialogue pools like that are generally more of use if you have NPCs that might spout off a single line of dialogue on their own before walking away, or situations where NPCs are chatting with each other in the background. Random pedestrians, in other words. For situations where the NPCs stay in one place, giving them even one line of unique dialogue would make them feel less generic than drawing from a universal pool.  3. With regard to the puzzles being bland, I again admit that I didn't get very far, and that the later puzzles might be better. The shield doesn't really seem to lend itself as much to puzzling as the boomerang from Legend of Zelda does, but that itself might be a reason to do things a bit differently. If you're trying to make a Legend of Zelda style game, all required items should generally have a use in the puzzles. The player will want to play with their new toys, and if they don't do anything beyond granting an advantage in combat, it makes them less interesting.  4. The story honestly is probably fine. It's an excuse plot, and nobody really expects an excuse plot to be great. It would be nice if the antagonist actively tried to prevent you from progressing somehow though.  5. A bit more enemy variety would be good. The first dungeon had one enemy type, the second dungeon had two. Not really that high a priority, but it might be nice.  I am genuinely looking forward to seeing what you're next game is, for what it's worth. You guys do seem to pay attention to feedback over on the game's forums, so I imagine that your next game will be a bit less empty.",

They aren't much to look at, and honestly they never were, but in the 80s that was all we had. You don't simply slap pixels onto a 2D map, add clunky controls and call it 'retro' if it doesn't actually evoke memories of a classic while you play it. That said, if you ever played any Zelda games on the GameBoy Color, you will likely enjoy the top-down dungeon exploration in which you avoid traps, find chests with keys or giant hearts that add to your health meter, and fight bosses with a sword or bow. The music is definitely better than anything the GBC ever chirped out, and it's short enough to complete in an afternoon or two. There isn't much replay value and the achievements are all fairly easy to get, but clearly the developers had a very specific experience in mind that they wanted to emulate, and they totally nailed it. 9/10.",

Shipwreck also gets into play without a long set up or narrative to sit through, which often slows my enthusiasm. If you like Zelda games, this game does the series a great homage and is fun to play.",
