I finished first game in about 2 hours on the easier levels. Clever if nothing else and good for a short while. I may get another play through but don't really expect 20 hours of play time. For what it is, I had a good time so I will recommend it. I will say the music did get a bit annoying after a while... :)",

I can't do this. Whoever thought that a TOILET simulator would be a good idea had to have been smokin' a little somethin'-somethin', know what I mean?  =--------PROGRESSIVE POINTS----------= *Wat is progressive about a toilet?  =--------CONTRARY POINTS-------------= *Clunky interface *Crashes Steam *Won't start half the time *Somehow has a release date of March 1st, 2000. Surely you jest?  =--------PERSONAL GAME RESULTS-------= I give this game a 0/10 I give this game a [SPRAY-PAINTED GOLDEN TURD]",
