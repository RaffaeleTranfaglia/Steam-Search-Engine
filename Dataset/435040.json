            "review_text": "I was really looking forward to playing this game and the first 20 levels were great! But starting with level 21, it became a 'do it my way or else' game. It is way too easy to not have enough of a resource to finish a level requiring a restart and trying a different strategy. After an hour, I finally finished level 21 and started level 22. When 'not enough resources' loomed it's ugly head in that one, too, I quit. I play games for fun... not to try to discover how the devs want the level completed. So for me, this game is a 'thumbs down'. Sorry.",
