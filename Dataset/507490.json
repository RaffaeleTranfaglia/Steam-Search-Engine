Its an awesome RTS game and I do recommend it to everyone Who Love RTS games, even for players who are not into RTS games.  This is a Fun, very easy game to get into but take time and dedication to master.  Don't be afraid on buying this game, its really worth it, your going to love it.  ",

There are a ton of different strategies you could use. 3) Each faction has its own strength and weaknesses, this is more distinct now. However, there are equivalent units on both factions like the mobile army teleporter and orbital nullifiers. 4) Love the strategic zoom, helps get a good feel of things, especially when you are in large maps. 5) Upto 14 players in a map. Seriously, 14.  You'll like this game if you like to focus on high level strategy and hate micromanagement. Also, there can be thousands if not 10s of thousands of units in a map and your game wont die.  It's basically SupCom on steroids.",

There were a bunch of kinks that needed to be ironed out and I feel that this has been accomplished with Escalation. The game feels more fluid and tactical, the zoomed out view is straight up fantastic and throws me back to the good old Supreme Commander days.   Battles don't feel sluggish anymore, although, on an unrelated note, this is quite system intensive. It works on my potato computer just fine for 1v1, but doesn't fare as well 14v14... :D  This is a definitive positive upgrade and well worth as a standalone game. I hope many people will purchase this game so 1. we can argue that strategy games ain't dead and 2. multiplayer is wicked fun.",

A couple of issues, selecting individual units in a mob is a pain in the ♥♥♥♥. and units have that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ tenency to run off chasing something to go and get killed. But these are minor things. Its a great game and with a little tweaking id say it could be 80% as good as Supreme commander 2.",

Forget the people who are comparing this to Command &amp; Conquer, the only similarity is the fact it's played in real time. Resource management is essentially non-existant and consists of pumping out units until you hit the cap, then increasing the cap and pumping out more units.  Fans of Supreme Commander or Planetary Annihilation would like this, but if you're wanting the gameplay of C&amp;C, look elsewhere.",

            "review_text": "This is still something of an early impression review, as I'm not done with the campaign yet and haven't played multi-player.  Now I do like the feel of this game, a streaming economy which feels a bit like how the Dawn of War games and Rise of Nations works. Combat feels fairly smooth with the 'army' function, which allows you to conform multiple units to act and behave as a single unit which increases the armies effectiveness. It's actually a pretty nifty and the AI acts well, that said the enemy AI is compotent and doesn't behave weird or plain dumb like a lot of RTS games which suffer from dumb AI. So kudo's on that.  Now for instability. I'm to understand the game was designed for DirectX 12 and Windows 10. Both of which I'm using and the game is pretty unstable, or at least was. I still experience crash to desktop every so often, but when it will happen is totally unpredictable. Though typically I'm able to get a good hour in before the game cleanly drops to desktop, sometimes with an error stating my video driver has failed and recovered. I've lowered my graphics down and disabled an overlays, such as the Steam and Nvidia GeForce experience overlays. Now I can't say whether or not this problem is unique to me, but from searching I can see a lot of people have problems with this game and instability.  So where the game is kind of fun, it fails on it's technical side on a subjective level. Though I imagine better rigs with superior gpu/cpu's may perform better with stronger stability, I can't recommend this game until these issues are addressed by the developer. But this game is worth keeping an eye on if you're really into real time strategy games.  Pros: -On higher graphics, this game looks fantastic -Strong AI -Unique gameplay mechanics, though very subtle -Decent tutorial and introductions  Cons: -Game is very unstable -Game is very taxing on gpu, pushing high temps and bottlenecks very quickly  I really don't have much bad to say, though ten years down the road this could be looked at as a run of the mill real time strategy which failed in the shadow of it's better bigger brother Sins of a Solar Empire (a much much better game, same developer, Stardock games) which is much more worth checking out.",

AI kicks some serious asre so if you're a Skermish kind of player your in for a treat :0  Running in DX12 it's amazing how many troops you can get into the fight and it looks amazing. I haven't found anything Negative to say but only played Campaign and Skermish against the AI so far in AotS Escalation.",
