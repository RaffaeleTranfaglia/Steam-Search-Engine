I along side side some friends played 1000s of hrs. and it was fun. now its a bit empty and it was not really updated.  but i still love it. It was my first mmorpg   Id say, go in with low expectation. it is p2w and it is slow but my oppinion , it is fun.  A word of warning. once you are lvl 80= you will find yourself to be a bit alone :) was just my experience.  Give it a try.",
