            "review_text": "This game is simply brilliant!  I'd say it's a HOG but there's no real object seeking mini-game in it, but it's still like that. I wouldn't call it an adventure game, since this one is no match for The Dig or any other point &amp; click adventure game, but still ... it became one of my favorite casual game (along with the  Drawn  series). I don't like wall of texts, so here is why - in nutshell:   Pros:     gorgeous graphics (both the hand-drown and the 3D graph are superb, I haven't seen anything like that in games like this)    animations are 10000 times better than in other HOG games    the story is awesome and it's really funny    most of the mini-games  are unique  and there are plenty of them    Cons:     blocker bugs (you don't necessary found them, but if you found one, you suck - read below)    no real achievements (but there are in-game [story] achievements)    it's a bit short (it's not really shorter than other HOG game, but still I could have played more for hours)   If you like HOG games and you're not fond of object seeking than this game will blow your mind. It's really a hidden treasure.   I encountered a bug in the bonus chapter and I'd need to restart my game after 2 hours of gameplay. It's really annoying and could have killed my positive feedback, but I wrote to Shaman Games Studio and I hope they will kill that bug soon. I'll keep this review updated!   UPDATE: I've played with other games by Shaman Games and it seems mini-games are far from unique, it's almost the same in every game of the studio.  UPDATE2: Shaman Games Studio hasn't replied and I believe they won't do it ever. Advice: don't rely on their support, 'cause they don't have any.",

            "review_text": "It's a short (2-3 hours) game, but well made. Nice graphics and animations, a funny story and the puzzles were never frustrating. The puzzles are definately on the easy side but part of that is because your inventory is never bloated with lots of unnecessary items and any time you find a puzzle clou it is displayed right next to the puzzle. Also there is no endless backtracking, just a handfull of screen to switch between. I also like the extras you get by finishing the game. You can look at concept art, download some wallpapers, listen to the in game music tracks and even choose from a handful of screensavers based on the games art. I had fun with this game and I hope Shaman games will create more games of similar quality.",
