            "review_text": "I would definitely recommend this game if you are a jrpg fan. The storyline was pretty solid, it was a lot of fun to rank up in the military more and more as you go and get new armor sets from the quartermaster. The characters have individual personalities and the dialogue is believable which I believe is crucial for this type of game. The artwork was also pretty cool, all of the enemy battle portraits looked great. Difficulty is always an important factor in these games for me as I am a veteran jrpg player with an overly high opinion of my skills, so having the option to ramp it up is always a win for me.  If there was anything to complain about in this game I would say it just needs some touchups here and there, like some tiles could be walked through that weren't meant to be walked through, and vice versa. Far from game breaking though, I got no real advantage or disadvantage from those situations. Also *mild spoiler* I wish the 'big bad' had a more active role throughout the game.  Overall I would give this game an 8/10 and would definitely say it is worth buying, especially since on steam its $8.50 right now.   As for the creator's request for feedback and question of whether a sequel should be made I would definitely say yes. A followup game to see what happens to marcus and co definitely appeals to me, and I think a second touched up product could easily be a 9/10.   Thanks for the fun time, Undefeated :)",

            "review_text": "Another great game from Aldorlea though this one feels as if it is a chapter taken from the whole book. The story revolves around 3 young people conscripted into the army and then sent to gather information about a wasteland. Why they are conscripted is not stated as there is no war but all males and females are conscripted for 2 years service. What exactly is the wasteland is not clear though it does seem to be the result of a fallout from some previous time. The characters are very likable - each with their own agenda and what they will do after their stint in the army. The game has a great sense of humour throughout with each character.A choice is given at the beginning of the game in the use of either the mouse or arrows, seen or unseen enemies and 4 levels. There is also the 'go through' ability once an area has been navigated saving time in repeated areas. Battles are turned-based and some of the characters have the use of TP- it is not something I like - would rather depend on MP. One team member has the abiltiy to make bombs if you find the recipe and the ingredients. There are 25 hidden areas as well a lot of items to be found lying around in areas and not just in chests,. 15 side quests are available too. The ending is somewhat abrupt leaving the player with questions but some hint is given as to what may occur. There are places on the world map that are not accessible leaving the player to wonder if a sequel was intended but never happened. It is a great game in itself - the mapping is beautiful as is the artwork. It can be a rather short game if the side quests and finding the secret rooms are not attempted. Overall I would recommend it.",

            "review_text": "Not played on steam  The title doesn't refer to an army or the main characters, it's part of what it's all about.  The characters will inquire on a danger zone and one of them will be of great importance to erase the threat but it has a price..  You lead a weird team with a wise Marcus tired of military life as he’s still a newbie,  Bastien dreams of being a cooker, Fela is a nice girl with a revelation, Enslan left the army for a reason and is linked to the final discovery, There's the tedious talkative monster Beriberu who'll fill your ears a lot unless you find the minotaur who’ll show him good manners ;)  It’s like a detective story as you’ll find some clues but still be surprised at the end.  In battle watch out for clues with magical skills logic (lightning hurts more being wet).  There are books icon for tutorials if you need precisions on stats, monsters weaknesses etc  CAUTION:  - with the dialogue to understand the quests - at the last part of the game, be well-equipped and good levels to go to the Wastelands cos there’s a number of comings and goings allowed.",
