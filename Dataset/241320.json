Ittle Dew is a fun but short adventure. It has a good sense of humour, good puzzles, and lots of opportunities to replay: There are alternate paths ('Professional shortcuts') and you can try to beat it without all the items. It took me 3h but apparently you can finish in 15 minutes. Most of that doesn't matter to me since I'm not interested in speed running. I still enjoyed my time with Ittle Dew and might come back to it.",

To put it succinctly, Ittle Dew is Indie Zelda and exactly the type of game development you want to be supporting: clever, charismatic, entertaining, and absolutely stunning. The developers clearly demonstrate competence here; If this was the latest iteration in Nintendo's franchise, you'd never guess it was made by anyone else - it's that good.  The only contentious aspect for me is the game's length. It's true I finished it in a single sitting, but I was also engaged with the characters and world in a way that made it difficult to put down. I hope the devs continue with the series and create a full-scale experience with their next game - their talents demand it!  Ittle Dew is excellent. Don't sit on the fence with this one.",

I can't recommend this enough. At the time or writing I've only played it for 40 minutes and I'm loving it.  This is one of the games that has sold me on Steam Big Picture Mode. It's as good a quality, if not a little higher than the 2D Zelda games Nintendo offers. We've already got a decent number of good shooters and action games that work well in Big Picture Mode, it's nice to see something that you'd normally only get from Nintendo.  If you don't want to pay full price, it occasionally appears in bundles and goes on sale but it is definitely worth the full £6.99. Ittle Dew is funny, full of charm and Nintendo should be cursing themselves for not locking it down as an exclusive. I recommend this game 100%.  Update: I wrote this before reviews could be made public, I tidied it up and fixed a few things. I put just over 9 hours into this game after writing the review and I completed 100% of the rooms and puzzles. I stand by my review, if you like fun then buy this game.",

Tippsie, her loyal sidekick, will give her some hints during the adventure. The only human being of the island, who is also to the manager of the local store, proposes her an exchange: a raft to leave the island, in exchange for an artefact hidden in the castle of the island.  A real adventure for the young Ittle Dew starts: resolution of riddles to move forward in the rooms of the castle; harvest of weapons and objects which will help her in the task; fight against monsters and boss until reach her goal.  The whole is made in a funny style, both in drawing and in dialogues. Monsters are completely stupid, and there is a lot of jokes about RPG: the hero who eats literally hearts to regenerate HP, the HP bar made of hearts drawn on papers and maintained between them with adhesive tape, jokes about useless items or achievements... We also collect cards of the bestiary of the game, which describe every character and their tastes in a parodic way. So we learn that some monsters like french fries, that other one is dizzy while it is a flying monster, etc...  The graphic style is original, with a real identity, childish and very colored style. Sounds and music are also very nice. On the other hand, it is a short game, between 3 and 4 hours to fully finish it, that is to say by ending the game, the secondary donjons and by collecting all the objects. Everything depends on your speed to understand and to solve the riddles. However, speedrunners and achievement hunters will be satisfied. Indeed, to get all the achievements, you will need to finish the game several times, and one in particular in less than 15 minutes!",

            "review_text": "Man, this one was certainly a pleasant surpise. I expected something at least decent but what I got was a great and clever puzzle game with high replayability and amusing dialogue/parody.   The core puzzle gameplay is based around sliding block puzzles, yes, but with interesting mechanics I've not seen done before, especially not all together in the way this game does. Every puzzle feels unique and fresh, and they range from the simple to the mind-numbingly difficult (though I admit that I looked up solutions to a few in the master cave... the harder ones there are also kind of the weakest, lots of secret mechanic stuff you need to know :s )  On top of that, there are four different ways to complete the game. You can get all three items or any combination of the two, and the paths you can take through the castle are quite different for each 2-combination. I quite enjoyed working out the different ways to make it through to the end, it kept replays fresh and interesting. The achievement set is also pretty great; a few bonus dungeons, 100% collection, and an added challenge to one of the routes for beating the game without harming a few specific enemy types (only possible via one of the four routes, sadly, and there's a bit of a ♥♥♥♥ move possible right after the final boss if you don't set up the castle properly... but ehh!)  The writing is also amusing, toying with lots of RPG tropes (especially Zelda tropes, which is this game's closest comparison to begin with) but not going overboard. It's very self-aware but clearly the devs loved the kinds of games they're mocking.  The one weakness of the game is the combat, which is very bare-bones and kind of picky; weapon seems to be a bit shorter than it appears on your character, most notably. It's not a big enough flaw to really detract from the overall experience, though.  The main game will probably only run you 3-4 hours by itself, including all the extras, but replaying is worth it even if you're not achievement hunting since it does change the game quite a good bit. I think the price is fair, although I did admittedly get this game via Humble. But in the end I'm quite pleased with this silly little game, it's quite a good time.",

            "review_text": "This game is much more a puzzle game than an adventure game. It consists of  80% block pushing puzzle solving with some of the hardest puzzles I ever faced and I faced lots. In fact the puzzles remembered me of the ones in Goof Troop. I often thought 'How can this even be possible?'. At least the   Master-Cave   will get you to really hard thinking. 10% being like Zelda and 10% making fun of Zelda ^^ (I love Zelda and laughed heartily, because it nails it)  The puzzles have some cool and innovative mechanics.   You can summon a portal block, then shoot a portal projectile which will teleport certain things to where the portal block stands. You can freeze walls to mirror portal projectiles or freeze ignited bombs to stop them from exploding a short time until they dew.   This I suppose gives the game not only its name: It will dew = It'll dew = Ittle Dew, but gives many possibilities for the puzzles. And these possibilities are used with skilled cunning by the devs *great praise*.  Suggested for pushing puzzle logic likers ;-)",

When I first got the game, I expected it to play very much like a Legend of Zelda game would. To an extent, this is true, but Ittle Dew is mostly about puzzle solving.  The difficulty of the game is around the sweet spot where the obstacles might prove challenging, but never to a point of frustration. This keeps the experience fun throughout.  The only problem was the length of the game. The adventure was over before I even realized.   Disclaimer:  I may have forgotten several details about this game as I'm writing this review 2+ years since I played the entirety of the game,",

It's short (there's an achievement for beating the game in 15 minutes or less!) but that allows for multiple playthroughs encouraging the player to skip dungeons. But why would you want to skip a dungeon in a Zelda style game? That's actually where Ittle Dew shines! The puzzles are crafted to let players figure out multiple paths throough depending on the items in their inventory. Well worth the time if you enjoy this kind of game.",
