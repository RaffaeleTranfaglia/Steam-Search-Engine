            "review_text": "A complete review and walkthrough in Dutch are available at  www.adventurespel.nl   Penelope and Aaron are secret agents of Pandora Global Corp, a CIA-like organisation. What they don't know, is that they are used as guinea pigs in an scientific experiment in which their DNA has been changed. They are send on a mission to obtain a certain relic. Everything goes wrong, they are captured and their special powers are released. Aaron is able to tranport them to another dimension. They have to get back, unravel the conspiracy and put the responsible ones to justice.  As you guessed by the above, The Apotheosis Project is a science fiction spy adventure game. The story is well told in small doses throughout the game. You can easyly identify yourself with Aaron en Penelope as they discover the harsh truth about the people they trusted and worked for. In spite of that, they never lose their sense of humor and interest in one another as is clearly shown in the well written dialogs. The game is fully voiced and the actors do the best they can to act naturally. At first the voice of Pandorra seems strange and irritating, but in the end you fully understand why she talks the way she does. The voices of Aaron and Penelope are well performed. I don't know about the English gram (as I'm Dutch), but everything they said was clear and understandable. Background music is good and underlines the overall atmosphere of the game.  The Apotheosis Project is an indie game, made without a big budget and expensive software. Taking that in consideration, the graphics are not bad at all. The main characters move smooth and the cut scenes fit nicely. Sure, the backgrounds are dark, but then the alternative world isn't bright and shiny, so it fits to the atmosphere. And darkish or not, they are well made and full of details. Those details are part of the fun. Yes, that means pixelhunting. After all, the agents are in a strange world and have to solve pratical problems like opening a door or convincing people to give information. So they look around for objects which could be usefull one way or another, now or in the future. They find a lot of junk, but even that will turn out to be part of the game. Try to get 1000 points and you know why.  Aaron and Penelope are both playable characters. You can switch any time from one to another. They have there own inventories, but you can always give any object personally to the other, which is even needed in a specific place. Controls and puzzles are not complex. Just click and think logically. Use your eyes and wits in solving problems and deceiving people and you will have a great time. The Apotheosis Project is certainly a game a would recommend! ",
