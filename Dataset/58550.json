            "review_text": "A fun little juant through the broad strokes of pre-book era Westerosi history. A fun little game, but certainly not a deep and strategic RTS, more of a set-piece manager- moving specially skilled units around to build and maintain alliances is the heart of it, with actual declared war working in a very similar mechanic. Still, depsite the simplistic and somewhat sophmoric gameplay, the game shines with great lore and setting, and should reward loyal fans of the Books and Show.  Make sure you get this on sale, it is certainly not worth a full retail price, offering low replay and a 12 hour or so campaign. Someone looking for a more deep and strategic RTS experince in the GoT world would want to check out the great mods for Civ5 and CKII. The former is a world class standard and far better for war and battle while the latter offers an immersive strategic experience in the delicacies of politics, marriage, and subterfuge. Game of Thrones: Genesis attempts both but really only succeeds in atmosphere. Remember that Halo RTS? Like that, except Game of Thrones and far less exciting.  In summary:  - good graphics and polish - rewards fans of the lore - simplistic &amp; arcadey RTS gameplay - no real depth to game beyond faction 'unique' units - campaign is fun and short - low replayability - not a serious RTS - still a fun little game for fans, if bought for a low sale price",

If you're a casual gamer, I'd avoid it. But if you like your games to require deep concetration on the whole map, and your a fan of Martin's works, then pick this up  (Especially since, at time of writing, it's only 3.74 in the sale!)",

This GAME HAS POOR mechanics, and without a doubt a very complex and confusing gameplay functions. Although the graphics reminds me of Age of Empires, Rise of Nations, this game is nothing like it. It's poorer in quality and taste. Waste of $40.",

            "review_text": "This game is rough. It has some interesting ideas about how to do video game diplomacy and intrigue, but those ideas are undeveloped, and make the interaction between the houses of Westeros feel like the mere shuffling around of RTS game pieces. It does have an admirable commitment to the series lore, but to get to the lore, you have to play through a dreary campaign which includes frustrating escort missions. You can control a Targaryen dragon, and it feels pretty powerful, but the actual mechanics of doing so are excessively 'gamey' (your dragon has a recharge time, making it less a creature of legend and more of an occasional special ability).  The presentation of the game is subpar, with a lot of tiny details that are just 'off' enough to pull me out of the experience. And the RTS mechanics are a bit undercooked - there's not a lot of unit diversity (or distinctiveness to the units that exist) and the tech tree, such as it is, is mediocre. The most interesting part of the game is the specialized intrigue and diplomatic units, and even then, I find the challenge of not knowing which alliances are real or which units are loyal to be more of a test of mental endurance than a genuine political-style puzzle.  The game is not entirely without merit, but I would not recommend buying it without first seriously lowering your expectations.",

I also fell in love with A Song of Ice and Fire when I watched the first season, then immdiately consumed the 5 current books. When this game launched, I was so excited and thought it would be a fantastic game.  Sadly, it was not.  The micromanaging in this game is seriously absurd if you are used to playing ANY other strategy game.  You do not engage in 'battles' per se. From the screenshots it really looks like you can have units engage in battle like in the Total War series. That does not happen here. Instead, you have very specific units scurrying around the map. Send envoy here; send assassin there.   The feedback and interface in-game is horrendous, it is very difficult to keep track of things.  Honestly, avoid this game, even if you are THE MOST die-hard fan of GRRM's work.  If you want a FANTASTIC, lore-friendly (and supplementary) game, look at: The RPG version     That one has actual meat you can sink your fan-driven teeth into.   This one, sadly, is a great disappointment and I sincerely hope no one else wastes their money on this.",
