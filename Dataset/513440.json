            "review_text": "Lambasting yet another ♥♥♥♥♥♥ F2P mobile game is so banal and obvious I'd almost call it cruel. These shitbags don't really know what they're doing. They're chasing the same mobile audience on the pc, where 40 year old bittervets are practically lining up to fire hate and venom at them. Is it really okay for me to dogpile onto the poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, knowing that? Somewhere, somehow I have to consider them the unfortunate victims of their own stupid actions.  Looking at the 'edgy' artwork that all the hip youngsters out there are sure to appreciate, I certainly feel Path of War deserves most of the hate. In fact, the story of the proto-confederate redneck rebellion trying to fight the evil DC government was something I simply had to see for myself to believe.  Atleast I didn't see any Trump jokes. Considering that like everyone in the mobile market, this developer is really only trying to dazzle the young and impulsive with flashy light shows and obstructive building delays into spending their parents' money, I can see why they've been made into a target like this.  All in all, I'll admit this game is not as ♥♥♥♥ as some of the mobile games out there. Which says absolutely nothing.",
