            "review_text": "I'm not normally one for horror games, but that scene from the 2nd Jurassic Park movie was basically imprinted into my childhood so I had to give it a shot. Quite glad I did. Even though it's definitely horror, you're in full control of your destiny, and I like that.  The game starts slowly and builds up tension quite expertly. There's a bit of narrative to latch onto (always goes a long way in making me feel involved in the world). The feeling of raptors stalking you is exactly as you'd imagine. Their movements, the sound, all really well done. The models and animations are a bit janky, but serve their purpose. The game changes things up a bit as it goes along, giving you a few more things to toy with and even a whole new threat (again, the build up to the encounters are great). The final section is hectic, and you need a bit lucky to survive that part (defending yourself becomes hard and you're screwed if multiple raptors decide to close in at the same time), but overall a great VR experience.  Can't wait to see the next chapters.",

            "review_text": "It's quite a bit better than I expected. I put it off because I thought it would be like 60% goofy 40% scary but decided to pull the trigger for Halloween sale. It is actually very well done and I'd say the only weird looking stuff is the raptors running at you when you lose on the first part. The raptors jumping at you looks better and is quite startling. Oh and the T-Rex's roar looked weird like he just chewed up snes yoshi and is spitting oversized pixel food particles at you lol. But yeah most of it is spot on and alternating between shooting flares and searching with the flashlight is fun. This game is quite different from Island 359 so if you like d*ck*n' with dinos give it a shot!  EDIT: Just got to the last part... it can be cheap at times with too many raptors to handle at once (3 at once with only 2 shots and long reload anim). Would recommend fixing that to not be too frustrating!",
