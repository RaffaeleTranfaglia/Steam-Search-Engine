This game is only for those keen on regurgitation. I think – no, I’m positive - that this is the most unattractive game I have ever played in my entire life. You know, in the short time I played this, this game demonstrated every loathsome characteristic of bad game design and even discovered a few new ones. It is visually repulsive, and intellectually ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Charging money for this is morally reprehensible, vulgar, insensitive, selfish, and stupid. The game has no purpose, a lousy sense of functionality and is broken in every sense of the word. I played Busby 3D, one of the worst platformers ever made, CortexGear:AngryDroids makes Busby 3D better, more enjoyable by just existing and lowering the bar.",

First, the game doesn't offer any sort of fullscreen mode, it starts in windowed mode and doesnt let you switch (ALT+Enter still works though).   The main menu is a mess, it's some sort of first person view with the cursor deciding where you look at. The options are held quite simple and are not worth mentioning.  The game itself was nowhere to be found. I just couldn't figure out how to play, where to play, what to play. There is nothing hinting you into a direction, and the different playable 'modes' are just you in a set up area that you can't leave.   A *good game* is something entirely different.",
