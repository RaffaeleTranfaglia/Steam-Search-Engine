            "review_text": "A great game needs a great villan. In FHM 3 that great villian is Jarmo 'The Butcher' Kekalainen, General Manager of the Columbus Blue Jackets and low-down traiterous F*#$ing swine!   You see, having never played a game like this one I decided to work my way up. I started with no job and accepted the position of General Manager of the Cleveland Monsters, assuming Cleveland was a low as a man can start. It apperared to be good job. Playing with the awesome tools at my disposal I spend the first hour assembling my roster into elite and dangerous line changes.   Satisified, I advance a few days. Suddenly an email pops up telling me that, argueably the best player on the team has been called up. Dammit, says I. I'll have to spend another few minutes tinkering. So I tinker away and right the wrong done to my team.   I advance another day, and not 1, not 2, but 5 players are called up.   Now for a persnickety fellow like myself this sets my ♥♥♥♥ to clinching. Deep breaths are taken. But, downing a beer, I decide to wait until just a few days before my first game to edit the line up again, lest it become broken by more call ups.   Then it happens.   Both of my Goalies are called up.   Now, Im not sure how deep your knowledge of Hockey runs, but I can tell you that, that position is somewhat important. Another beer goes down. I recruit the best goalie on the market. I assume he was recruited using a local add in the classifieds next to the guy selling an old ridiculous large aquarium and the lady selling Yorkie-poo's, because he has exactly half a star of talent, and one whole star of potential.  It is at this moment I wonder why this is happening. Im not an evil man. I don't beat my kids nor do I call my fellow man, 'bro'. I try to do good in the world. I like to leave large tips and ridiculously long reviews for the products that I enjoy. Why is this happening?  Then I found my answer. Jarmo Kekalainen the Columbus Blue Jackets GM was f*&amp;%ing with me. How do I know he was just f^$%ing around. Because after over paying the leagues least talented goalie and updating my line ups two day before the game, this son of ♥♥♥♥♥ sends 3 of the 6 called up players back. Only now each one of them is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ the F*^$ off that his dreams of NHL glory were crushed and the take no solace is returning to the stately metropolis of Cleveland. So now I have some talent back, but said tallent does want to be there.  My first loss is lopsided to say the least. It looks like the score of and NFL football game. I decide that I am not going to let this bring me down. I trade away all of my talented unhappy players for a goalie that isn't incompetent and 1 decent right winger. I win the next two preseason game and God Damn Mother F*&amp;^ing Jarmo takes my God Damn Mother F*&amp;^ing Goalie. He is kind enough to send back one of the ones he took. But that poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is, of course, no longer satisfied with his lot as a Cleveland Monster and does, in fact, lose the next two games.   So I have come to a decision. I will crush Jarmo. I am going to turn this nightmare in Cleveland around and get promoted to the NHL. And eventually I am going to replace his sorry ♥♥♥ in Columbus. Ill take the NHL's tiniest salary if I have to, but I will unmake everything that he has made. I will see him and his family on the streets. If he takes another job, Ill go and take that one too. He tasks me. He tasks me and I shall have him! I'll chase him 'round the moons of Nibia and 'round the Antares Maelstrom and 'round perdition's flames before I give him up!   11/10 Would make a nemeisis again.  PS. To the developer. That litte crown on the icon for guy with a coaching advantage...that...I have strong opinions about that...  ***11/19/2016 Update****  HAHAHAAHAHA!!!! In the year 2023 The Columbus Blue Jackets finished 29th as I trimphantly lead the Florida Panthers to their second Stanley Cup. The fans waited anxiously for their beloved GM to accept a contract exension, but nay, I SAY NAY! He did not. He accepted the postion of GM and Head Coach of the Columbus Blue Jackets as the Blue Jacks abandoned Mother ♥♥♥♥ing Jarmo like a pregnant prom date.. Why would the NHL's Top GM do such a thing? Because back when he managed the Cleveland Monsters Jarmo stuck it to his team without even sending over some KY to smooth things over. Here is where I will build my dynasty! But first, I'm calling up every player on the Cleveland Monster that might even almost be viable...because...I can! I love this game!  I would also like address some the negative reviews posted here. If you are considering buying this game, you absolutely should. I have had 3 game breaking errors since I started playing. I literally could play no more and within a few hours of posting the error on the developer site they were fixed. The developer is VERY invested in this game and many of the negative issues that are being brought up can, have been, or will be corrected.   While they are pubished by the same company that does OOTP Baseball, it a completely different team that made this game. I have had nothing but positive experiences here. And no I do not work for them. I post as Jubal Early on thier forums too, you will see me there.",

            "review_text": " Pre-Release, Public Beta Review  Franchise Hockey Manager 3 is quite an improvement from the previous installment, where glitches and a poor interface ruined gameplay. FHM2 felt uncompleted, and just far too difficult to get into. The best point to be made about FHM3 for myself is the new tactical system. Just the sheer amount of roles and worldwide strategies puts the game above last year's edition. Looking at the other new features - NHL License, Path to Glory, Sandbox, International, Rebuilt Injury System, Updated Development Process, Updated Interface, Steamworks Support, and Steam Achievements - while all are nice additions, the one that stands out is Path to Glory. While the gamemode actually runs extremely slow in simulation, the concept and basics are there. Obviously needs a lot of tweaking, for example, the in-game sim at times freezes, and the boxscore doesn't always show the second goaltender if you take out your starter mid-game. But of course, it hasn't been publicly released yet, so I'll let it slide. The international aspects, while interesting, also has many issues, such as two-goal overtimes. Overall, the AI has gotten better, but still could use improvement, and there are definitely too many injuries. Apart from that, the game seems solid, although I do wish the simulation would be as quick OOTP, and if not, at least that we could see stats durinng the loading times.",

Very frustrating.  Nov. 12 Update: Since the latest patch I have found the game to run much smoother and with way less crashing (I believe it's crashed once in approx 6 hours of game play). After reading some other suggestions I switched the auto-save feature to weekly in order to minimize any potential lost time. Thanks to the developers for updating and addressing the concerns. It's much more enjoyable experience now and I would recommend the game to others.",
