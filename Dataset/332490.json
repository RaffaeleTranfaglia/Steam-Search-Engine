            "review_text": "Hey, Harpoon it's not. But then again who has the time to invest ina game like Harpoon. Battle Fleet 2 is a mix of fun, some light strategy, a little bit of tactical thinking and the satisfaction of watching your salvos hit the mark. It isn't for someone that wants total immersion, but it does give us elements of everything that one needs to to lose themselves in the S Pacific or Atlantic while waiting for the kids to get home from school or on that boring flight to Tampa for business.   Historically accurate, up to a point and interesting enough to hold the attention of a military history student such as myself, I think that the developer has hit the right mix to appeal to someone who otherwise might not purchase or be inclined to play a war game on any level. Furthermore, the developers do care about what the customers say...more than I can say for some companies.   Pros:  Fun  Decent Enough Graphics and Sound Some Good History  Engaging, but not demanding Has replayability  Cons:  Not deep enough to appeal to real military hounds Feels a little 'appy'   Overall, This gets my thumbs up for the way it can fill in the void of stupid apps to a pretty darn serious PC gamer like me. Like I said before: Fun, Engaging enough and fills the niche left between dumb apps and super serious strategy.",

Highly recommend, if you are one of those people who go for the gameplay per $$ value this one has some great replayability to it!",

Graphics are OK for this type of game although it would be nice if you could get up even closer during the action. It's got a pretty basic control system and is easy to learn, it could become pretty adictive if you like these kind of games. I've not tried the multi-player yet but will be doing soon.",

            "review_text": "Battle Fleet 2 is a fun and addictive game. There are lots of ships including various battleships, cruisers, aircraft carriers, destroyers, frigates and submarines for both side of conflit: US and Japan. For the single player campaign mode, the AI is very competent during the tactical battles, but I find it lacking in strategic layer, the strategic AI is too passive.   For those unfamiliar with this type of game, players take in turns shooting at each other by setting the angle and power for each shot, seeing where that shot lands and then adjusting their next shots until they hit and destroy their opponent's ship. Battle Fleet 2 has detailed shot and damage modeling, including the altitude of the shells are modeled during their firing arc. The graphic are crisp and clean, interface is simple to learn and pick up, the sound effects and the damage modelling bring the fights to life.  Thereâ€™s not much to fault this game on, except no save during tactical battles and the campaign mode lacks depth, also one can argue it is entirely too easy to use smaller caliber gun to get bearing and distance, then obliterate the opponent with bigger guns. But this is really fun and addictive game, highly recommanded.",
