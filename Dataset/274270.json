Each level seems to be a copy and paste scene with copy and pasted characters from previous levels. The limited controls and bizarre keybinds puzzled me, because through options you couldn't change the arrow keys to i don't know... the WASD keys AND you couldn't change the shoot, roll, and special weapon keys either. You'll find yourself about 30 minutes into the game wondering why you bought the game when you realize that there is nothing unique in the upcoming levels and that the Bunny's little speeches before levels don't benefit you whatsoever.   Overall, a nice concept and story line but bad execution made me very down on this game. Worth $12? Maybe. Not a first choice for $12 games though",

            "review_text": "NOT A HERO is a tongue in cheek comedic high violence platformer starring you as one of the many assistants to an enigmatic character known as Bunnylord. Your purpose in the game is to complete various missions for BL in the hopes of helping him to win an election.   The graphics are pretty retro, but not offensively so. The music is catchy and the characters’ banter entertaining. As far as gameplay goes, the concepts are fairly simple (shoot, enter cover, reload, dash, tackle, execute) and can be picked up fairly quickly after the first tutorial mission. Depending on the character you choose, your style of run and gun will differ and some people will be easier to play on certain levels than others.  I kind of liked the limited mobility factor in that you cannot jump in this game and must instead make your way up various nearby buildings and dive through windows to progress in some areas. The slide tackle mechanic is also a nice addition and combined with execution, if timed right, it can make for a downright frantic yet rewarding experience. Some enemies in the game are immune to the aforementioned combo and must be dealt with in other ways.  Overall I think this is a nice game that yields around 7-10 hours depending on whether or not you want to get the full ending or just clear it. Some of the levels have some really hard challenges like “don’t get punched” or some sort of time-based objective, which can be kind of a drag if you manage to finally pull it off and then die or get punched right near the end of a level (this happened to me a lot). That being said, this game regularly goes on sale for less than $5 and is a total steal at that price. Worth it just for the voice acting and goofy plot.",

            "review_text": "Would a purple homicidal anthropomorphic rabbit from the future be a better ruler than the real ones we have today? Sadly, the answer is: quite possibly. And that’s exactly the premise of Not a Hero from London-based developer Roll7 that already made a name for itself with the acclaimed side-scrolling skateboarding game OlliOlli. The idea presented by BunnyLord is that, for some reason, the world will end unless he gets elected mayor. The polls aren’t in BunnyLord’s favor and apparently the best way to turn voter opinion around is to assemble a crew of misfits who will brutally and mercilessly poke crime in its ugly face. Well, we’ve certainly seen worse election campaigns.  The story is about as preposterous as it sounds. BunnyLord is obsessed with milkshakes, turtles, pandas and murder (oh, and cheese) and will send the player to perform a wide range of tasks through the territory of three stereotypical gangs. However, all of these tasks basically boil down to killing everyone in your path. It’s a good thing then that killing in this game is really well done. Not a Hero is a 2D side-scrolling cover-based shooter on two planes with the second plane acting as cover. It’s an instantly intuitive system as both you and your enemies are slightly shaded upon entering cover. There’s no jumping in the game, but sliding serves as a substitute mechanic and it is pulled off brilliantly. Basically, you can slide to move faster and also to tackle enemies which enables you to execute them point blank. However, there are enemies that cannot be tackled and they have to be avoided and shot from a distance.  The first character you have at your disposal is BunnyLord’s best friend Steve, but as you go through missions and increase BunnyLord’s standing in the polls, more characters will join your cause. Every character has a distinct amusing personality and it is obvious that this is a very British game. I never got tired of hearing Steve shout “fookin’ ‘ell” as he encountered droves of enemies. Then there’s Cletus (“Dressed like a hillbilly, but actually from Scotland”), Samantha from Wales (“Valley girls last longer!”), Jesus from Spain who has formidable hip-thrusting skills and my favorite, Mike from Northern England with a constant eye twitch most likely indicating a murderous sociopath. There are nine characters in total to unlock and more importantly than their personality, each of them has different skills, weapons and abilities which completely changes the way you go through a level. For example, Steve’s specialty is tackling, Mike performs silent executions, Stanley has high rate of fire good for crowd control whereas Jesus is a really fast runner and performs executions while moving.  The map design is good, but rather straightforward. Each level offers some additional objectives that occasionally take you away from the main route, but most of the time there’s just one way to go through a level. Apart from a helicopter encounter, there aren’t any setpieces to mix things up a bit and offer a bit of diversity. Even during the three boss fights, you’re more of a bystander taking care of other enemies while BunnyLord takes care of the boss. The game does throw you in the fire a bit with enemies popping up unexpectedly most notably when the SWAT teams enter the building and start chasing you down. Enemies also drop various power ups for your weapon and secondary weapons such as grenades or turrets are also scattered through each level.  The game uses pixel art for its graphics and while it’s pleasant, the art style isn’t particularly strong. The same can be said for the soundtrack which uses retro 8-bit music. The goal was obviously going for a retro feel in a more modern package, but neither component really stands out. The controls and the mechanics are tight and responsive. The game runs well for the most part, although I did experience some slowdown in certain places. It’s not anything major, but it is noticeable due to the nature of the game which requires pinpoint precision and speed. There’s a bit of trial and error as the game demands you to memorize the level layout and enemies and then perform really well in order to get to the end because you have to start over from the beginning each time you die. This does get just a bit frustrating, however, the mechanics are so well implemented that you’ll definitely want to jump back in and finish the level. It has that addictive element to it and once you master it, the sense of accomplishment is great indeed.  The game’s biggest drawback is its short length and lack of longevity. Once you finish up the 21 levels in the game all of which are very short, there’s little incentive to go on. You can go through levels with different characters to get better results, but it’s not that compelling. It’s a shame that the game doesn’t support Steam achievements as those would possibly facilitate more gameplay experimentation and provide more incentive to re-visit a level, if wisely implemented. I also have one gripe regarding the story. The premise is great, but the game doesn’t really take it anywhere. Sure, there are a lot of jokes here, but a more engaging political satire, which is actually hinted at in the trailers and the advertising but which is not in the actual game, would go a long way to make this game not only more current and relevant, but also more humorous. Based on the pre-release campaign, I expected something like a gaming equivalent of a cross between the senseless slapstick violence of Bottom and the edgy political satire of The New Statesman. Which would have been brilliant. As it is, though, Not a Hero is only half way there in that regard.  Not a Hero is a very enjoyable game thanks to its tight mechanics, exhilarating gameplay and humorous story. There’s definitely room for improvement and seeing as how the ending leaves the door wide open for a sequel, it will be very interesting to see what Roll7 does next as the foundation laid here is strong indeed.  7 OUT OF 10 (VERY GOOD)",

It reminds me of Hotline Miami, but instead of having floors and checkpoints, your expected to do the whole level with one life. It makes the game fun... until you die the first time, then you repeat what you did, die again often from frustration and carelessness, then repeat what you did again, over and over again, until you finally complete the mission with all of the challenges thrown in. Its nerve wracking, its frustrating, I never have fun playing this game. The first few levels were a blast, because they werent to difficult and I was allowed to complete them in my own way, having fun with the levels. Towards the end you will be memorizing every single enemy encounter, every single time you shoot you will count your shots to reload so you dont make a turn only to find you have no bullets in your gun and instantly die from a katana.   In short, the game is a grind, a completionist grind where you have to behave in a scripted, overly cautious manor to complete any of the end game levels, thus making all the color and humor pointless.",

            "review_text": "I would compare this game to Hotline Miami like so many other people do, but it's far-off from it.  Not a Hero is a game where you are a amateur campaign manager/assassin tasked with cleaning up crime in the city. Your boss is an anthro rabbit from the future, and he gives you some ridiculous tasks sometimes. In one level you're murdering drug dealers and in the next you're rescuing giant rat heads. Whatever the case, you need to take down crime bosses in the end, specifically a Russian mob boss, a backstreet gang leader, and a triad yakuza boss.  The game is very fast-paced, as I was able to complete the first 2 chapters in only 3 hours. It has the interesting mechanics of ducking for cover and sliding under your enemies to stun them. There are 8 unique characters, each having their own weapon or ability. Cletus wields a shotgun, Ronald uses melee only, ect. One of the more interesting parts of this game is the powerups and usable weapons. With them, you can shoot lasers, explosive rounds, or pretty much anything out of your gun, as well as throw molotovs, ricochet grenades or a cat that explodes near an enemy. There's even secret levels and challenges as you go along, but I could never unlock the secret levels or complete all 3 challenges.  Overall, the game has a nice feel to it, although it would help if the soundtrack was a bit better in some cases. I like the pixel graphics and sidescrolling design of it, and it's always fun to play a political game where you can beat someone's face in with a hammer.  I rate this an 8.5/10.

NOT A HERO is a comedic shooter where you help an anthropomorphic bunny... From the future *wink* named Bunnylord win an election by fighting crime with a bullet to the head. It's essentially a cover based 2.5D shooter. Graphics are pixelated and look nice, you can choose from a list of Bunnylord's supporters to fight in these levels and each have their own abilities and unique attributes. The humor is my style of awkward weird which I like and the music is just kick ♥♥♥. Every level has a set of optional tasks which can alter the game's ending which I am personally not a fan of but I can see the appeal of.  Now the problem I have with this game which you'll surely notice when playing around the second half of the game is that it's cheap. It is really cheap at times with one hit death enemies and a lot of trial and error. The last few levels can seriously go F*CK themselves because they are really unforgiving. The characters you can play as seem unbalanced such as with Mike being personally the most useful out of all of them. The time it took for me to play this would have been halved if the level design for some of the levels weren't so unbalanced and unfair. I would not suggest playing this game if you have a really short temper.  Still this game is quirky and you can have a lot of fun with it when you're in the right mood. I'll give this game a 7.5/10. The humor alone is worth a look at if you're into awkward weirdness. That and the combat can be really fun when the level design isn't so cheap.",

            "review_text": "With a preview article appearing in free London rag 'The Metro', it seemed that NOT A HERO was destined for great things in May 2015. However, due to a release delay &amp; several unfortunate control related hiccups at launch it seemingly fizzled away without the usual hype you seem to see from the YouTubers let's playing the current indie darling.  This title is a 2.5D (or Iso-slant as they call it) fast paced, pixel art cover shooter. Think Gunpoint mixed with the frantic action of Hotline Miami. You're tasked with helping an anthropomorphic alien known as BUNNYLORD to become mayor. His main strategy which he'll brief you with in hilariously randomized pre-level sequences is to mostly 'kill people very dead awesomely' and also drink milkshakes.  Roll7 are an English studio and it tells through this game with almost all the main characters given regional UK dialects. While it doesn't offer much of anything in the way of story or character development, it's a nice touch to distinguish different skill types on your controllable protagonist.  While getting from one end of a level to the end isn't particularly difficult, each stage will come with several additional challenges. Most are time or kill streak related &amp; nearing the end of the game, these will require almost pin-point reflexes and stratagem to make it through.  While the game itself is a lot of fun, humorous &amp; challenging, the major flaws arrive in that only 1 of the 8 or so unlockable characters (Mike) is actually a viable option to complete the game &amp; all its challenges. While it's still amusing to dabble with the others, more balancing should have been carried out to provide more possiblities in playing the game &amp; using all the characters in a different fashion.  Keeping in mind the scope &amp; budget of the game, it would have also been nice to see a bit more story originating from Bunnylord's FUN CLUB members.  While perhaps not in the upper echelon of the current golden age of indie steam titles, it's still rather good. Hopefully this won't be the last we see of Bunnylord from Roll7. While it's £10 full price might be a hard sell to those who weren't already sold on the trailer (which is still dare I say one of the best on the service), it'd almost be impossible to pick this up during a sale or bundle &amp; not have a good time.",

Pro: + short levels make for good short sessions. Also doesn't make one feel too bad if you die and have to redo the whole level. + quick paced + variety of characters you can unlock, all with different playstyles (though that doesn't become that apparent for the first 4 imo, or maybe it's just understanding the game mechanics better that makes you get why and how these character play rather differently) + replayability for the optional missions (which are quite hard sometimes) + overall good level and enemy design + can be quite difficult at some points, especially if you go for all the optional stuff   Cons: - Level design in terms of presentation. There are 3 worlds with the same basic design, the first two are rather a bit boring and not so nice to look at. Not much detail, mostly in the same color (or shades of the same color) - Controls can be really annoying sometimes. The slide and cover button are the same, meaning that you'll always slide into cover, which works really nice most of the time, but it will also leave you not being able to take cover if the cover is too close to your position, which usually leads to sliding into the enemies or their firerange. Really annoying. Also The shoot and execute(when enemies lie on the ground) button is the same, so you can end up wanting to shoot that guy running at you, but you will instead execute the guy on the ground, which (since you can't cancel it and takes quite a few seconds) will usually get you killed. - Visibility issues sometimes. Powerups are always in the front, so enemies can sometimes 'hide' behind them. Same problem if there's too much carnage (though that rarely happens). All in all this is not a big problem and rarely ever happens, but of course IF it happens it sucks hard to be shot at or killed by an enemy you didn't even soo, even though he was right in front of you.  Overall the game was and is a lot of fun and I'm happy I bought it, but be prepared for some frustration every now and again, as a result of control issues.",

It does remind us of Hotline Miami with its violence and color scheme, but it has its own twist of humor. Lot's of funnny voice acting and characters to enjoy. Maybe kinda cheesy for some, but it will make you chuckle at some points.  But humor and style ain't enough: it's the challenging gameplay that should take the cake in these kind of violent games. It's face-paced, intense and hectic. You don't need to master to game to play throught he campaign, but eventually you want to get all the objectives crossed off the list. This gets good once you get the appropiate characters you unlock. But these objectives require you to do stuff that some challenges the mechanics more than they do you...  For instance, the objective 'don't get punched' sounds way easier than it is, considering you also need to complete the objective 'reach the reported in x amount of seconds'. After finishing the game, I still don't get WHY I can't tackle an enemy but get punched instead. Is it because he is shooting? Or because he is reloading? In either case, I had a 50% chance of succefully tackling him. Another problem was taking cover (which you do with the same button as with tackling). Sometimes my character wouldn't take cover at the column right in front of him, but instead slight right into the fist of an enemy.   This was headache inducing especially in the last level.  I did get bored with it at times and went back to it at other times, when I DID enjoy its repetitive nature. It was then, that I enjoyed the unlocked characters and its straight forward gameplay.  Lastly, I there are technical problems, some of which has been resolved since its release. Some still do persist, like the inactive cloud saves (so back-up before you uninstall!) and the occasional crash to desktop when restarting the level for the 10th time.  Try out the game. Get a refund if it doesn't gell with you, which I would totally understand. Personally, I was suprised that this game was made by only one guy, which I think is atleast worth mentioning.",
