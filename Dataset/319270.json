            "review_text": "This is a box moving puzzle-em-up, which is easy to learn but super difficult to solve. It's about SpaceChem level of difficulty (e.g. hard), so don't worry that it only has 50 levels as you won't be finishing them quickly. The soundtrack and art have a classic puzzle-game feel. The Steam version has some nice new features, and considering the cheap price any hardcore puzzle fan would be a fool to pass this up. Highly recommended.",

            "review_text": "I want to like this game. I like puzzle games of most sorts. I enjoyed the crap out of Spacechem and Manufactoria. But while the way of thinking is similar, I quit playing this game wihtout having spent much time on it. Why?  Because it just didn't feel good. Not only are the controls terribad, but the very premise just feels off. In all honesty, it feels like there was meant to be something more than moving things from point A to point B, before the devs noticed that was hard enough. The game feels like half was removed because the other half was nothing but a mess.  If you're thinking of getting this, Manufactoria is both free and better. If you've already played Manufactoria, you'll just be disappointed by this.",
