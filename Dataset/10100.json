            "review_text": "King's Quest 1 was the first game that deeply impressed and made me realize how videogames are a medium and format with limitless potential. I understood how they could go infinitely beyond the simpler arcade titles of its time, in which you just played an eternal repetition trying to reach a good score. Not that I am against this kind of game, hell I still play a lot of those to this day, but we couldn't just stop there and KQ's contribution was paramount for this.  The feeling of adventure and fantasy that the series provides - especially 1, 3, 5 and 6, and yeah I played them all - is unparalleled, and Roberta Williams' huge sensibility to transpose the magic feel of fables and folk tales to the games is a delight to enjoy. Somehow makes you see things with children's eyes again, with that mixture of curiosity, excitement and awe.  I'm very happy that this collection is back on the Steam store for old and new fans alike. It has been recently updated with a fix that we previously had to manually apply all the time, so there's also that. Have fun with 7 amazing classics!",

So if you experience issues you could easily replace the DOSBox binary. A nice collection, comparable to the GOG version (which is offered as three different items).",

It's fun to look back, but I don't know that these games would be particularly palatable to a younger audience, and there's a LOT of 'mother may I' throughout the series.  Some sort of technical issue is preventing me from playing anything before 4, but I will give a callout to the series for having a strong, relatable female protagonist in 4.",

The color palatte is horrible, audio glitches abound, and the FMV looks even worse than it did 15 years ago. Steam normally does not dissapoint but this is one of the laziest releases they have ever put out and in its current form absolutely not even worth the $10 price tag",

Well of course I bought them from gog directly after, running smooth. I just hate when big companies sell products like this, and you have no chanse to get your money back! Don't buy theese game here!!!!! Im recommending this game, but hopefully some of you won't throw 10$ in the sea, shame on you Steam!",

I tried installing the most recently suggested patch from below, but that caused all of them to not work until I uninstalled the patch. please HELP! the only one I was most interested in playing was #7 and of course it happens to be the only one that wont seem to work with Windows 8  Edit: I guess I should have read through the reviews in more detail. It is a shame that Steam offers this when it is not compatable with any new computers for KQ7. They should reduce the price and advertise it for KQ 1-6. Anyone know how to request a refund?",
