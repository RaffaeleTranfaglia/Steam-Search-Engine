            "review_text": "So I read through the reviews before I bought this game with a bit of trepidation - usually, lots of bad reviews are a bad sign. But, this was £2.50, so I though 'why not?' took the plunge and went for it. 90 minutes in, I'm greatful I did.   In terms of gameplay, it is limited, I'd admit. There are 3 modes, where you manage your fleet and staff's abilities, a mode where you dispatch units to regions that increase in size, and a mission mode, where you need to investigate and fix faults with customers cars (a bit like car mechanic sim).  Overall, while gameplay is limited, this is a good little game, so if it comes up at a bargin price, get it, even if it just lasts a few hours, the relaxation and addictiveness is worth it for the time. I'm around half way through, and not sure of the replay value, but I'm grateful I went for it after all!  ",
