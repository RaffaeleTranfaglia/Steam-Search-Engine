            "review_text": "Deadstone is a top down twin stick zombie defense game in which you protect a bunch of colonists from the rampaging horde of Martian Zombies.  The games strengths are in it's depth of strategy, there are many ways to protect your colonists and many ways to build your character. There is also a really cool UI Function where you set up ans save defense layouts before a mission adding a nice splash of tower defense to the gameplay. With that you can better cover all your zones more effectively. All the controls are really tight and responsive the game rewards you for being accurate and efficent.   The game has a good story with great characters and well written dialogue. The game also features a survival mode as well as co-op.  For the Twin Stick Enthusiast, this zombie wrecking action is totally worthwhile. :)          YouTubeâ„¢ Video:  Deadstone - (GameScope)&nbsp;",

            "review_text": "TLDR: Good game. Buy it on sale. See conclusion for what sets it apart from other TDS games.    It's a simple top down shooter. The main shooting gameplay is simple and repeatative as such is the typical restriction of the TDS genre, but yet also at times pretty intense and challenging. And the gameplay as a whole is a repeatative cycle of mission then prepare for the next mission but keeps the player in a comfortable flow that removes the negative feelings of repeatativeness and replaces it with anticipation. Anticipation for what new gear can I buy, or just waiting to get a break from a very tense, challenging mission. The flow and changes in action to strategy is balanced very well and keeps the player engaged. Missions are challenging so you'll actually appreciate the break from the action and also really enjoy it due to the fact that the player is given so many decisions to make regarding planning the next mission.  As for the missions, they start with an interesting, well written page of dialogue. Usually I hate having to read through sentence after sentence of character interaction (just let me get to killing something!) but the dialogue is interesting and well written such that each sentence is meaningful. I didn't want to miss any of it! Then the action begins. The enemies come from the top and you're trying to kill 'em off as fast as possible so as to not to let any get into the base (get past the bottom of the map). If they do, you'll loose a survivor and that means your research upgrades come slower. So you've got to keep an eye on your surroundings so you don't get mauled by zombies, also watch your ammo and look for the right time to reload vs switch weapon, and keep a third eye on your radar in case there are zombies elsewhere slipping through your defenses! It'll be a sigh of relief when you finish your mission and you'll definitely be looking forward to the break in the action where you can take your time to plan out your defenses for the next mission. Before I get to describing the strategic part, there are also rescue and survival type missions where you must survive for a certain amount of time. These are on separate maps/areas, where you won't have your turrets, mines to help you out. You can also seperately play survival mode apart from the campaign.  Now, for the strategic aspect. This is an rpg. You gain XP which will allow you to unlock perks for your character from a plethora of options. You also earn stat points to increase things like constitution, speed, accuracy and mechanics. Speed is for movement speed; accuracy is weapon accuracy. Constition allows you to carry more ammo (you can also buy an bandolier which will further increase your ammo capacity), but constitution also allows you to use the more advanced weapons you'll unlock through research. The research is done automatically by the survivors. You'll start the game with a set number and you can loose them if enemies get past the bottom end of the map on the missions. Through the mechanics stat you'll unlock access to mines and turrets and you'll be able to lay them out on the map and save the layout before starting your next mission. As you increase this stat you'll be able to buy and place more mines and buy upgrades for your turrets. An interesting point is that turrets initially need to be manually reloaded (by standing by them) which adds more tactical depth to the missions.  Next the weapons. There are four classes and I think 3 or 4 levels for each weapon class. You have pistols , an automatic type of gun (smg and ARs), a rifle (sniper rilfe/bolt action) slower rate of fire used as your precision, long range weapon, and a shotgun to complete the balanced ensamble. You can equip 4 weapons at a time, so you'll want to have one of each so you have a balanced arsenal on the battle field. But don't try to purchase each one right away. It may be better to spend your precious money on different upgrades or ammo. Instead of upgrading the weapons' individual stats, you'll unlock a more powerful version of each weapon in the class (which gives you the option of skipping an entire tier if you want to save some money). Having these 4 distinct classes keeps the weapons balanced and adds tactical depth to the gameplay as each serves their own specific purpose. Reload times are significant in this game which gives the pistol usefulness as a backup weapon (as it serves in real life), and also adds to the tension. Your move speed is also somewhat slow which makes having a precision weapon important. You can use it to take out that lone enemy on the other side of the map so you don't have to give up your current position that your holding to take out a more numerous threat. (You don't want to let even one enemy through). Then there's the automatic weapons, probably your most used weapon to mow down the hoards. And when the mobs get closer and you need to deal with them quickly pull out your powerful shotgun whose spread can hit multiple enemies at once and saves you time from having to aim precisely.  You'll also have usable items to help you in the field. A detpack (explosive, can be used to take out   burrow holes where enemies spawn from  ), a health pack to heal yourself on the fly, and a flares you can place around the map to help you see at night.  The only negative I have with this is that it still is repeatative. You are on the same map for the majority of the game. There are a few other maps for arena/survival missions and rescue missions, but I think it'd be better if there could've been say 4 different enterances to the survivors' base that you had to defend. And if there could of been some kind of debri or something that you could take cover behind, something you could shoot over that the enemies would have to walk around, or large rocks you could use to hide behind (and not shoot over)... that would be awesome. (And rotating camera view, fixed behind the player like a third person shooter, would be cool too.) Even so, this game would keep me engaged for an hour or so at a time. I'd do maybe about 5 missions in a play session and I thoroughly enjoy it.  CONCLUSION: The excellent flow of gameplay, strategic planning before the action in each mission, the interesting story and dialogue, and the abundant choices in gear/upgrades and options for difficulty (&amp; even choice of which story: serious or tongue in cheek!) and relatively lengthy campaign is what makes this game stand out from the rest of the TDS market. Definitely worth it on sale.",

            "review_text": "tl:dr Playing this feels slow, clunky and is at times unresponsive. For $10 I would not recommend, for $1, I might recommend, but it's really up to whether you can justify paying for an experience you could probably get for free from a hundred better games on armor games.  I was going to write a much longer and more detailed review but just read the tl;dr. this game feels like it's from the 90s, the graphics are bad, the voice acting (where present) is bad, the sound is bad, the story/writing is bad, the one level you play is poorly made, the controls are bad, the gameplay is poor when the standard for shooting defense games is so easy to succeed on... I mean there's so much about this game that just screams bad.  On the plus side the rpg elements are there, you can find perks (which I'm not convinced work, cause the magnet skills didn't work for me????????), stats, a shop, and a building menu that is present between levels. I found it's the only redeemable feature of the game. The rest of it plays very poorly and the low level graphics are not quite pixel cute nor are they full graphics, they're just so-so.  The game just plays horribly bad and it makes me not want to play it. Also tried to switch to a controller, but even with the rotation speed maxed out it still moves too slow to react. So the only way to play this is on a keyboard and mouse.. Oh and bullets fired from a pistol move so slow you can't hit anything more than right next to you.. no joke.. and I get that maybe they made it that way to keep the accuracy on pistols down after a certain distance, but come-on, the gun already does no damage.  I really don't understand the other 10 reviews (all positive), I found the game to be virtually unplayable.   So save your money unless you really need steam trading cards, because that's the only redeemable aspect of owning this game.",
