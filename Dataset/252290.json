After giving it a try, I've got to say that whilst the concept is great, in practise it is a huge failure. There is hardly anything to this program! Sure, it's sort of interesting to look at - what there is of it, anyway. But there is nothing there to even remotely justify the relatively hefty price tag. There is hardly any content at all. Very disappointing. Quite frankly, I've received better inspiration for stories whilst sitting at my desk and staring out of my window into the street. Thank goodness I got it included as part of a Humble Bundle - If I'd paid full price for this I would feel REALLY let down.  If you're an aspiring writer, forget this useless program. Get out into the world and look at what is going on around you.",

            "review_text": "Imagine going to a museum and seeing an enormous, beautiful painting of a long-abandoned alien world, and having a notepad with a few abstract sentences and some fill-in-the-blank mad libs to encourage you. That's essentially what this game is; you stroll through the world, observing, and occasionally are prompted to write something, anything, about it. You also have the option to read what other players have written. I was hoping for more, so my one playthrough (so far) left me feeling unsatisfied; but I seem to be in the minority, because a lot of people have said this helped them. Give it a try! Maybe it will unlock the writer within you?",

            "review_text": "Elegy for a Dead World is not a game but an interactive tool for writing short fiction. You explore three different worlds while either filling in the blanks of an existing story or writing your own tale from scratch.  The locations themselves are beautiful and the existing story stubs are pretty decent. Unfortunately the game suffers from lack of content. There's only three small worlds to explore and they are all tonally rather similar. Dead worlds filled with the ruins of ancient civilizations.  While I found the idea great, I still wouldn't recommend Elegy for a Dead World. The full price on Steam is extremely high for the limited amount of content you get. And besides, at least for me it wasn't even that good as a source of inspiration.  The good: - Interesting concept - Beautiful worlds  The bad: - Limited amount of content - All the locations are rather similar - There are much better sources of inspiration out there",

            "review_text": "Preface: This is a very SHORT 'game'. It honestly feels like a preview rather than the whole product. It's also certainly not for everyone. It's geared more towards the type of person who writes long headcanons for their villagers in Banished or create elaborate backstories for their Bioware characters. For people who have used programs like Zen Writer, this gets you into the same kind of simplified mindset-- there's nothing but you, the art, the sound, and the words. You won't get the editing and organizational capabilities of programs like Scrivener, but it's extremely useful for allowing you to write without the distraction of fiddly program features. That said, there's a lot to recommend it to gamers and writers alike.  PROS + Beautiful artwork. Like absolutely stunning. + Great prompts-- just enough to get you thinking if you need them, but without guiding you too much + Export option-- love the ability to export your stories, though only as HTML  CONS - Too short! Needs many more worlds, with more complexity - No spell check - Space available for writing is limited to 1000 characters per prompt-- definitely not enough when you're on a roll! - No ability to export as a simple word or txt document - Atmospheric sounds are good, but repetitive (and loud!)  What I would dearly love is a game that expands on the worlds available by tenfold, and that gives a more comprehensive writing program with adjustable capabilities.  SUGGESTIONS (just in case the devs ever want to expand or someone wants to make a similar program)  * Add a lot more worlds * Spell check during edit mode * Quick access to each prompt area on a world from the end menu, with short previews of each prompt text (so that users don't have to read through each area chronologically to find where they want to edit). * Include a manual save option so that we can simply press, say, f11 to save without closing the prompt box * Unlock the word limit for each prompt area * Allow users to import music from their hard drive into a 'writing playlist' (like Zen Writer) to use when they don't want to listen to the in-game music/sounds. * On-Screen volume control * Export to text document option",

If my expectations were a bit too high, well.. Sorry.   Actual Gameplay: Lacking. Honestly, I was extremely excited when I first saw this. I started it up, and saw an impressive starting point. It seemed as though I was floating around in a nebula, with a jetpack to propel me where I wanted to go. 'Whoa.' Was pretty much my first thought. Then I jumped into a wormhole/portal and got down to the writing part. It turns out, it just shows you a 3D-ish landscape in which you can move forwards and backwards. Around the place are little 'Prompts' that start you off with a few words. You are supposed to continue on from these promts, or if you are unhappy with what they said, you can change it. Personally, I found that it felt like a joke. 'And here is a church where the worshipped-' and you were supposed to fill it in. Another example: 'Here is a school were children were taught-' Again, continue on. If you read through other peoples work, then you would see random words jumbled together, or lackluster 'Poetry'. This bothered me, as I'm a stickler for grammar, flow, and spelling.   Over all, the game is decent, but it felt like a joke in my opinion.",
