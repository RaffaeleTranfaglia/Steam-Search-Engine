The solutions to puzzles and combining items is not clear and often I was unsure how to proceed in the game or what the current goal was. Meh to put it simply. I would also like to add this game has alternate endings depending on the player's actions and ability. The better you do the happier the ending; the worse you play the more bleak and depressing the ending.",

            "review_text": "I got to play this game for around 5-10 minutes I think (steam shows 28, but it includes directx install), and I'm forced to write my first ever review for a game, ever. And it's a bad one. My findings:  1. Absolutely horrible frame rate at miniature screen resolutions (1024xSomething). I was in fact astounded by that slide-show. I have never seen another game on my computer (intel i5 with nvidia 525m) with that low frame rate. 2. As soon as Lara got her clothes on in her Lyon apartment (the absolute beginning of the game after pressing 'new game' button), game crashed with 'Memento.exe caused a EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION blablabla' stack trace dialog.  I expect games I buy to be relatively stable and work out of box. Performance might be forgiven, especially if it's an adventure which doesn't require fast reflexes, but crashes mid-game (in this case, before game really begins) are such a turn-off. In fact, THIS is the first game I bought on Steam for which I would like to have my moneys back! On the other hand I'm glad I only paid 1.99 euros for it yesterday when it was on sale, so not much damage taken, fortunately.  My recommendation: DO NOT BUY. ",
