            "review_text": "I really wanted to like this game, because the dev seems like such a great person, but the game itself isn't very good.  The game is constantly updating, which shows that the dev is working on making this a better game, but there are some bugs that make this not so much a great game. Controls feel generally bad, since there is a lot of random generation there are some poorly placed blocks (For example, a lock on a wall that leads to nowhere) Also, the campaign doesn't save, so when I Alt+Tabbed, the game crashed and I couldn't be bothered to start again from the beginning. Only 2 kinds of enemies and the boss is incredibly easy.  On the plus side, the game is an easy 100% if you're an achievement hunter.  Since the dev is working on the game a lot, I hope that I'll be able to switch this to a reccommended eventually, but for now I can't reccommend it.",

            "review_text": "Imagine Me is a side-scrolling randomly generated action platformer.  It features a campaign and challenge levels, as well as a workshop. The campaign is randomly generated but sadly, the level design is broken and offers too little variation, making it repetitive and boring. The challenge while interesting is somewhat easy and can be completed in less than one hour. In the end I'd say there are other platformers that surpass Imagine Me in every single aspect, making it not worth the money or time.   ★★☆☆☆ | Disliked it",

Perhaps there's a decent story in there somewhere but the level design, movement, and hit detection make it a mess. Sadly game design toolkits like GameMaker make far more polished games than this. For $3 it's not a major hit to the wallet but I can't see why anyone would buy this game outside of a bundle deal with something they do want.",

This game is just a 2D sidescrolling dungeoncrawler with some easy bonus levels thrown in. The campaign never ends, the challenge levels are too easy, and the game is still somewhat boring. Glad I only paid like $1 for this game, if it was any more I would have been upset. P.S. It says I have 1.5 hours on record because that's how long it took me to beat everything there is to do in this game.",

The challange levels are a joke though, not really any challange what so ever. Besides that though, This game could have a lot more potential.  Overall 3 bucks for another 100% game is not bad... but thats about it. I would have liked to see more with the 'boss battles' compared to the ones available. But I don't know, in the end the game feels unfinished and there is not much to do.   Meh 5/10",

I've played about 2 minutes, yet there's already something that really annoyed me: the backgrounds sound. It's almost a droning sound, very low (bass-y), but it's really uncomfortable. And, when you die (which is a lot), it slightly stops and goes back to the beginning. I've never had a game do that to me, but it's really bad! Surprisingly so.  Anyway, iffy hitboxes, the first campaign level is not only too hard, but also a disjointed mess. Clearly not a carefully designed level...  I'll pass it.",

The only good thing going for this game is the music and SFX, which really is not good, considering this game has been thought out for at-least 3 years now (From the kickstarter page that still stands, from 2011). To me, and it seems many others, the cons out weigh the pros.  Is it the worst game I have ever played? No, that would be an overstatement. This game is one to keep and eye on, but in its current state is not a good buy. The devs do work on this game still, so its still a WIP, but once again in its current state its not a buy.  4/10",

This game has no redeeming qualities. The controls are awful, the art is ugly and the level design is horrendous.  When you produce a game, even for the first time, it should be the best you can do, not something you just throw out there for money. This game shouldn't even be on Steam.",

Its a one hit you're dead puzzle platformer game.   &lt;~&gt;PROS&lt;~&gt; -The simple design is nice -Easy to pick up and play -Good time killer if you want to play something quick -Updates here and ther  &lt;~&gt;CONS&lt;~&gt; -Its sadly too short and it can be beaten in a hour -Hit boxes are unclear sometimes -Some of the hard levels are just too easy -Despite it being a quick in and out game the replayablity isnt there. I'll maybe come back to it every 8-9 months and play it for 15min at most.  I would recomend this game but I wouldnt pay $2.99 for it. maybe $0.50-.75",
