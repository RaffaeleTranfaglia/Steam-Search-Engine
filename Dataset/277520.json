            "review_text": "I will open as several other reviews do:  I really wanted to like this game.  I must echo what I see as the dominant issue with the game: The inventory system is absolutely dreadful. I want to say it'd be fitting on a mobile device (as in perfect for swiping); it's NOTHING but annoying here.   You have two buttons bound to Previous and Next Action. Not sure if that works in scrolling through your inventory; there is no proper menu for the inventory. It is a drop-down thing at the top of the screen that you can scroll through with the mouse wheel (if something else that you can interact with isn't in the vicinity of the reticle, otherwise scrolling cycles through the actions with that item). Once you get to the item you want, click and drag the mouse down. Click and hold to bring up a radial of your possible actions with the item. Drag towards the action you want to do.  Theoretically, that Previous and Next Action could nullify this gripe; once you get down the action icons, it's (theoretically) quicker to do the mouse dragging.  More often than I'd like, either dragging an item from the inventory or dragging to an action - the visuals show that the game accepted your action, but the result isn't shown (either no item equipped or nothing done with the item). Such finnicky-ness would be fine in a 'casual' puzzle game, but in one with action...   I shan't criticize the puzzles, as I'm glad to see another vague first-person puzzler (Kairo, FRACT OSC, Ilamentia, Antichamber, etc.) that isn't grounded strictly in the abstract ( that has practical puzzles, i.e. lockpicking and rotating pipes to allow for flow ). All I can say is, if you're stuck, go back and pick up every object that seems of some interest. Upon entering a room, most interactions with them will be Observe and Drop/Throw. Once you get a step closer to progress, make the rounds again to find that you can now Use some objects.   Along with the Inventory system, the general actions are extremely clunky.    Also: Why does Longy only hold onto an object for a few seconds before dropping it on his own?!?!?!  No words can describe my stupidity. I misunderstood the controls in the Options (rebind-ed them). For some reason, the 'Previous Action/Next Action' at the top threw me off.   I made it to the fourth room, found some shears, Longy commented on another eyeball (it wasn't hostile before then). I decided to Fight with the Shears; a few spams of the mouse button (after selecting the Fight action from the interface, which was a pain - one must wait a certain amount of time before the game decides to register the action you dragged to) and the shears flew out of my hands. Eyeball seems to have escaped.  EDIT: Shears flew out of my hand because no words can describe my stupidity.  Monster didn't escape; another story with actual Eyeball.  I have to assume that the issues with the game are because the dev wanted it to be as 'realistic/immersive' as possible, taking cues from those games that did away with 'intrusive' interfaces. For example, games like Montague's Mount, Dream, and ASAMU don't allow the player to actually pick up pages, only to zoom in ever so slightly.  That vision of realistic/immersive impedes the accessibility and intuitive-ness, making the game little more than infuriating.  The story and atmosphere necessitate that I leave a Positive recommendation... The game itself gets in the way of that, though (and not in the way one would assume (i.e. puzzles)), so I must do what I did.  Know that the point of the *Thumbs Down* is more to get the attention of the dev, rather'n to dissuade you from buying/playing it. MAYBE it simply comes down to getting used to the interface; thus far, when I've thought I've gotten it down, it acts unresponsively ('one must wait a certain amount of time before the game decides to register the action you dragged to') - I get discouraged from slogging any further into the game.   EDIT: I would have turned this review positive because I cited an issue that furthered my case in DownVoting the game that wasn't an issue with the game at all, but with mine own intelligence. However, I made it to the fifth room and am still having to wrestle with the mechanics just as much as with the big and hostile Eyeball residing therein.   I hope (and actually expect) to turn this review positive, if I can beat the game.  Not to end up saying 'Psh, it wasn't that bad, I can recommend this game because I beat it, though I couldn't while I was in the prcoess of beating it.'  It's to say - as I said - that the premise and atmosphere is very alluring; should the story ultimately satisfy, the 'slog' will have been worth it, contrary to what I said.     TL;DR  ((This whole review serves as further proof for the definition of 'review'; how can one review something without having experienced it 'well enough' (in this case, actually beating the game)?  Tynon_1221 has no business writing reviews. Do Downvote this))  Albedo is a first-person puzzler set within an intriguing universe.  Those who don't get frustrated with the puzzles, will probably with the Inventory system.  The developer should be proud of the game, abso-fickin'-lutely.  Tynon_1221 shouldn't be as impulsive. ",

            "review_text": "It's a point and clicker but with more interaction and free movement. Reminds me a lot of one of my earliest posts, KGB Unleashed 1954 a lot, and that's not especially a good thing.  It's a nice looking game actually, and has some good classic sci-fi business going on, but the first 20 minutes of my playtime were me just saying 'what the ♥♥♥♥ is even happening.' And that's at least partially my fault because there's an in-game manual that gives you some basic controls and a vague sense of what you're supposed to be doing that I completely ignored. To be fair to me though, the game is kind of sold as an indie FPS type of thing in the promo videos.   And maybe it changes later on, but from what I could see so far, it's much more of an adventure game than anything. The puzzles are ok and so far I haven't run into much that couldn't be overcome with a little bit of dorking around, but it's really not grabbing me. I will say that this game is pretty impressive for a dude doing it all on his own, though. It just makes some weird design decisions, especially with regard to the user interface, that make ♥♥♥♥ a lot more complicated than it really needs to be. Probably won't stick with this one, but hey at least it was weird as ♥♥♥♥.",

Graphics are are fairly well done, the audio is fine barring a bit of shoddy voice acting but that works with the B-Movie feel of the game and I didn't run into any bugs.  The puzzles are actually fairly logical and I didn't arrive at a point in the game where I was scratching my head for hours trying to figure out how to fix a nuclear reactor and finding out I needed to use a platypus and toothpaste to prevent a meltdown.  The cost at the time of this review was $14.99 and while I enjoyed the game, it did only take me about 3-3 1/2 hours to finish. You can decide if the price is right.",

            "review_text": "I want to say that I could recommend this game to someone, but I honestly just can't. The visuals are fantastic for what the price is, but the gameplay itself lets the game down. As the game likes to say on the cover (I bought it on disk), there is 'Plenty of mystery and Suspense' along with 'First person action against sci-fi monsters'. Now I haven't gotten far in the game, only down the elevator where my computer crashed because I pressed the windows button by mistake, but form what I have seen there is not much action at all, nor is there very much mystery and suspense. As for it's claim for having 'Superbly challenging and detailed physics puzzles', that is 100% true. Too challenging. I spent 10 minutes trying to pick a lock only to end up picking up a spider. I wasted 20 minutes looking around for the key that I had to blow out of the vent since it shows literally no indication of where the second vent opening was, only to find it sitting on the f***ing floor of the elevator. As for this aclaimed 'Unique hint system with a device to 'See into the furture'', it's garbage. Literal trash. It has no purpose and does absolutely nothing for you, and it most certainly does not allow you to see into the future from what I've seen so far. Not to mention that the controls for this game are bizarre and complicated, needing to scroll through items and options for each item then choose that option along with all the hotkeys you can press, it's mayhem. Alongside this, the dialogue makes me want to throw up, it sounds like one of those stupid robot-like voices and it's done in nothing but monotone. No expression whatsoever. Overall, I just couldn't recommend this game to anyone unless they enjoy wasting their life on useless and dull games.",
