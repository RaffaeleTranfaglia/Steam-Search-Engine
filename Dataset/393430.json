            "review_text": "Is it the most realistic ice fishing game? Definitely not. Is it fun? Absolutely! Especially when played with friends over voice chat.  The devs have assuredly played Pro Pilkki before, since there are quite a lot of similarities in the game mechanics and that is not a bad thing. For years Pro Pilkki has been the best ice fishing game out there and it's really a time for it to have some competition. Does Ice Lakes provide the competition? I'd like to think so. It has it's ups and downs but over time this game could take the spot as #1 ice fishing game, assuming the devs will provide updates and fixes to it.  Ice Lakes is still fresh out of the oven and that can be seen, especially on the multiplayer front. Hosting a game / being able to join a friends game can be quite a pain in the buttocks. Setting a password or lowering the max players value don't seem to have an affect. But once you get going, it's really fun and I'm optimistic that these small problems will be fixed in coming updates.  If you are expecting realism, then you might be a bit disappointed. The fish weights and amount of fish you are able to catch can seem quite absurd at times. 1.2kg ruffe.. that's something I'd like to see IRL ;) If you are up for some arcade ice fishing, then this game is definitely something to try out!  5/5, will recommend!",

            "review_text": "11/22/2016 Update: When Ice Lakes VR was released, the game was literally just a 3D experience with a HMD and Vive controller as basically a mouse pointer. I re-purchased the game to give it another shot based on the latest update. The developers did a great job in moving toward a true VR experience. From the very moment you select a spot on the ice, you manually drill the hole. You can move items around and manually scoop out the ice which I was expecting when I first purchased the game. I didn't catch it my first play through but they also added a fish fight feature which is disabled by default. In addition to the variations in vibration intensity based on fish size, you now can be prompted to lift the controller at certain points while reeling in the fish which is a nice touch. I am changing my view to 'recommend' as this is no longer just a 3D version of a gamepad style game and the efforts making this more immersive experience you could expect from a VR ice fishing game is appreciated. I made an updated gameplay video of this game to show the new features:         YouTube™ Video:  Ice Lakes VR - A second look Gamplay (Post 11/14/2016 update)&nbsp;",
