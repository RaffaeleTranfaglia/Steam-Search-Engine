His cold expressionless face and rigid movements definitely made me feel like I was being studied by some calculating machine, while also giving him enough character to be interesting.   You won't be blown away but I can't think of one reason not to get this.",

            "review_text": "Decided to play this before watching the original short it was based on. (The short has a little more at the end though)  Quite an interesting 'story', filled with some questions on what is to be human and the nature of emotions, though requires someone to want to explore these concepts in afterthought rather than being spoonfed during the experience.  And really, it's just an experience, you are 'seated' in one place and it plays out.  Can only really reccommend it if you're into the whole sci-fi horror genre, but hey, it's free!",

            "review_text": "This experience would have been better suited for release as a 180° stereoscopic video.  It really ruins the immersion that you can't move your head, only turn it.  It could have saved the experience if e.g. you were able to pull your head away when the robot comes close, with his movements compensating to match your movement.  As it is, all animations are completely static, including the very unrealistic moth that doesn't appear to be obeying the law of gravity as it flies about the room.",

It could have been scarier if you saw the robot slowly cutting into your arm. That would have made it very unnerving and would be very weird once you noticed it wasn't your arm they are cutting into XD Barely a horror game...  It's free, and you can play it. But I don't think it's really good.",

I finally tried this game a few weeks after downloading it (I downloaded several VR games for the SO and friends to play, this one they did not make it to) and after trying myself, I immediately had to check if I paid anything for it or not; I am glad I didn't.  I don't feel this offered anything that other 'free VR games' do and honestly, I felt as if I wasted 10 minutes of my time. It did not instil fear, the monoluge did not make me interested in any way; if this is based on a short film then should it not make me interested in seeing said film.  Overall, while yes it is free, I still don't find the time spent playing it worth playing it at all.",
