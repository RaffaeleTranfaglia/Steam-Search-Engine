If you look for a combat simulator game then you must have this game(and of course ARMA, ARMA2, ARMA3), and if you prefer an arcade shooter game you should go for COD or BF.  This game offer you a realistic combat : when you heard a shot you MUST go prone or crawl to make your safe. A heroic action such as run towards the enemy while you shooting at them is not a smart idea. You will die in a second if you do that.  This game will takes your time as much as you wanted to survive on the battlefield. A great plan may takes your time to wait for the right time at the right place. You may move on a longer path to the enemy position to make a safe approach.  And don't forget, this game come from 2000's and graphic is suck(compare to 2014's) but gameplay is great!  I give this game 10/10  1 : 3, Driver get in that Abrams. 3 : Roger!  KABOOOMMMMM  1 : Oh no! 3 is down!.",

The visuals have aged badly, but it's got it where it counts: the fun factor.  If you have a low-end system, this is a great game to pick up. It includes the Cold War Crisis and Resistance campaigns.  This is not a game where you can rely on your twitch abilities, regenerating health, and hit markers. One shot can mean death. There is bullet drop. There is armor to contend with. You have to think to win.  A brilliant game, full stop.",

This was total blast as a multiplayer and single player campaign was interesting enough to keep my engaged until I finihsed it (multiple times even). Some of the missions are quite tricky and may require multiple tries, which coupled with the limited saves per mission can get very frustrating.  Infantry operations are the most fun part of the game. Messing with tanks is tolerable and flying vehicles are annoying. I especially enjoyed that not all missions were about running into a village and gunning everyone down, but required stealth or simply survival.  Game is pretty old and graphics reflects this. Good part is that it should run on a lower end machine as well.",

At that time no game could even come close to this revolutionary to open world game.  when i was a child my dad borrow this game from his friend and me being a 6 year old boy who really love to play army men, i saw my dad played this game and i asked 'can i try it?' and he let me tried it and instantly fell in love with this game. after fiddling around in the single player mission and failed horribly i accidently stumbled across the Mission Editor, i completely baffled by the UI because i couldn't understand a thing (let alone english) and what it does at the time, then i tried to mess around with it and slowly figured out how to place soldiers and vehicles then starting to put waypoints to a unit and create my very first mission. even though the mission itself didn't have any objective i imagined the soldier have their own quest and conversations between each other and having a blast on making it as well as playing it.  since i grow old enough to understand this game i can really felt the struggle, the emotion and fear that the soldier have through out the campaign and made a lot of single player missions by the time i was 13. eventually i finished the game and boy i never felt as close to a real war playing any games other than this ( little bit of exaggeration but you get the point.)  thank you Bohemia and Codemaster for this incredible game, but mostly a huge thanks to Bohemia Interactive Studio to made a sequel to this we all know today as the ARMA series",

If I am completely honest the game is (or at least for me was) a frustrating bug filled mess. I spent hours just trying to get the game to work right on my computer. I am guessing most of these issues were simply because the game was so very old. It is forgivable however because the game provides an adequate view into ARMA's roots. When you do get the game running you will be happy to find a decent game and you will finally see how far ARMA has come when comparing ARMA: Cold War Assault (Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis) to the newest release ARMA 3. Overall I was glad to have picked this up while it was free, and think many of you, if you have taken the time to read this review might also enjoy the game. I hope you take the time to learn a little about the ARMA series as well.",

I managed to put many hours into the first few days playing this non stop.  The age of this game hasn't age all that well for some people if they judge by graphics, but if you are like me and focus on gameplay alone, then this is an excellent game. In my opinion this has just been the copy for the newer Arma games because I played them all and I can say for sure that they all were just a copy and paste from this one with just a newer engine and updated graphics.  But with that beside us, let me get down to the pros/cons  Pros: Very realistic and our own military uses the newer arma games for some training programs and demonstrations Nice mods that implement many more campaigns, WW2, Vietnam, ect Great teamwork online(yes people still play) With mods, improvement in graphics and sounds Overhaul, excellent and get this if your hardware can't handle the newer arma games  Cons: Without mods, not so great graphics/sounds Some hiccups for an older engine UI for editor is ok, make sure to have it on advance,    Thats it, I highly recomment it, thanks!

Your heart will actually beat faster when sneaking up on a base full of 'reds' in the aim of blowing up their parked tanks. You will have to take your time and be tactical in your decision making. This is no 'run and gun' arcade shooter. This is 'I have to position my AT soldier on that hill, so he can hit that tank in hope of disabling it whilst we open fire at exactly the right time on the sentries patrolling the surrounding cluster of houses. If we don't kill them all in time they will spot and maybe take out our injured and exposed fire team who has painstakingly crept into position just behind that grouping of bushes'.

The only game that could touch it was the original Ghost Recon which i also loved very much, but OFP had no invisible walls and drivable vehicles that allowed for freedom of movement that had'nt really been done before in a FPS. Games such as Far Cry, Crysis, Call of Duty, Halo, and many more owe this game homage in some aspect. Its too bad Ghost Recon went in the reverse direction and became more linear.
