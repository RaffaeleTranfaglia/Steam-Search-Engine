    "description": "Tower of Guns is a fast paced first-person-shooter for the twitch gamer... with a few randomized elements to keep it fresh with each playthrough. It's a short burst &quot;Lunch Break FPS&quot;... not unlike Binding of Isaac mixed with Doom 2. Tower of Guns was made by a guy named Joe (with his brother Mike composing the music).",

            "review_text": "Tower of Guns is a semi-procedurally generated 'lunch break' FPS that's condensed the shooter genre to its utmost essence. Run, jump, strafe, shoot, try like hell to not die. That's really it. No game saves, no quickload, no plot beyond 'here's a tower full of murderous automatons, you want to be at the top.' And when you die your game is over and you must start a fresh run, which googling tells me is a genre called 'roguelike'.  Not being familiar with roguelikes I can't speak to how good an entry it is in the genre, but my formative gaming experiences as a kid mostly consisted of plugging quarter after precious quarter into sadistically difficult arcade machines, hoping to unlock their secrets—or at least eke more than a few seconds' entertainment out of *this* playthrough before the inevitable failure because damn those machines were brutal. Tower of Guns definitely hearkens back to that philosophy, minus the quarters of course. It is punishingly difficult, requiring super-twitchy reflexes and an almost zen-like ability to strategize on the fly as a shload of happy projectiles come shrieking your way to give you a great big hug with nuclear arms. It's also therefore intensely rewarding when you do manage to reach the other side of an insane battle with your organs intact.  If this sounds a bit grim and violent, well...it isn't. The cartoonish art design, lack of blood or gore (none at all to my recollection), and frequently black sense of humor running throughout encourage players to not take any of this seriously—even as the ever-increasing difficulty keeps the tension ratcheted up to 11.  Seriously, I'm in love with this game. You can get it way cheap (&gt; $5) during sales, but it's also well worth the purchase at full price.",

ToG is a quasi-procedurally generated rogue-lite FPS. The controls, while not as flawlessly precise, definitely take their inspiration from classic FPS games like Quake and Unreal. Graphics are nothing to drool over but as I recall this game was more of a hobby project and taking that into account, it’s rather impressive. Difficulty wise, the game ramps rather aggressively as you progress through your run. As per usual with procedural generation, many of your runs are going to be at the mercy (or lack thereof) of the random number generator. Some of the enemies can feel cheap, but there are a variety of guns you can unlock that I only assume makes managing each type of enemy easier. Overall, it’s alright. I don’t know that I’d spend much money on it, but I certainly wouldn't avoid it in a sale.",

Tower of guns is that and even more ! Pros- -Point of the game is clearing the Tower of Guns by killing everything within the tower. -You got lots of weapons that you will unlock by completing numerous tasks and each of the guns brings new gameplay feel, and playtrough style. -There is a really great variation of enemys and bosses. -The levels are randomly generated at some point and the items and almost everything else aswell. -Lots of power-ups that you can obtain and also lots of Gun Mods that can Modify the way your guns shoot or what shoot which is adding really diverse gameplay. -There are also variations of Perks that you can either make the game easier or hard as hell. -Finally adding things like Easter Eggs,Secrets,Comedic Dialogues,Endless mode and more makes the game even mroe epic ! Cons- -The price is little bit higher (I recommend wait for a sale !) -After you beat the game several times and unlock every weapon the game will be kinda boring.  FINAL VERDICT If you like the idea of mixing FPS with RogueLike, buy the game ! If you dont like rogue like games, this game its not for you.",

You can choose from a number of weapons, but none of them affect how you use them or how you play, they just deal different amounts of damage. Destroying enemies doesn't feel satisfying; you just click towers, hope your 1km/hour projectile hits and then watch as the tower slowly turns orange before vanishing after a few seconds. Pickups disappear after a very short period of time, so if there's any action going on most of the time they're not even worth picking up. Floaty jumps and lots of vertical rooms, but huge fall damage discourages you from exploring and jumping around too much. Enemies don't hurt much but they're pretty much unavoidable and you can't easily get health back. The ending is basically a screen of text that says 'you win'.  Altogether, the game feels like a hodgepodge of game mechanics thrown together for no coherent reason.  Runs smooth, looks fine, handles fine, adjustable field of view, unlocked framerate.",

            "review_text": "This game is great fun. There's some good humor in the dialogue (which comes in the form of a randomly selected set of narrations that play at the start and end of each section--there are a lot, and they're consistently entertaining), the guns all feel quite varied and well-suited to different play styles, and the random level ordering adds a good bit of replay value. You can unlock almost all the weapons and perks within a few runs, so there's not a big sense of the game being locked away behind difficult hurdles (though you'll probably have one or two perks/weapons that take a bit longer to unlock). There are some great secrets hidden around the game, ranging from kinda funny to just downright awesome. The levels range from feeling manageable to complete, utter, only sometimes frustrating chaos.  If you're doing an endless run--where after the last level, you restart at the first--you can get some absolutely insane setups. Forty or fifty jumps that you can pull off one after another in mid-air, a giant shotgun that seeks enemies, and an enormous rideable rocket are just some of the possibilities. (it really is every bit as fun as that sounds)  There are a few problems with the game, but fortunately they're generally very specific problems affecting specific situations or enemies and with fairly simple possible fixes. The only exception is that some levels are much, much rarer than others. Since what specific level you play after each section is randomly selected, you'll end up traversing the same dozen or so in each area a lot, and see a few of them only rarely (there are some I've seen maybe once or twice, while others I've seen probably thirty or forty times). There is a cool sense of finding a new level, but the apparent discrepancy with some of them is a bit disappointing for me. That said, there are still plenty of levels (each with slight variations and numerous possible combinations of enemies), more than enough to keep most people satisfied for a while.  I'd guess there's about 15-30 hours in this for most people, and I say it's pretty well worth it at $15, and especially worth it if it goes on sale. Most of the game's value is that you can pick up a session, play it through, and be done (or, more likely, dead) in about an hour once you get good at it (less if you're not so good or get unlucky). This game is a lot of fun, and despite a few issues I have with it, I give it a big recommendation if 'roguelike first person shooter bullet hell' sounds at all like something you'd like.",

It's a rogue-like FPS bullet hell with randomly generated rooms and random bosses. ~8 upgradable weapons, 2 unlocked by default. About 10 perks(2 default). An endless mode and some other things I haven't checked out. The art style reminds me a bit of Borderlands. Interesting secrets to be found, illusory walls, high places, tight places, etc.. I think I reached a cap of having 9 jumps(8 extra in mid-air), which is fun and still not overpowered. It has controller support. The weapons are just upgraded automatically when you collect enough XP during a run, and it loses XP as you take damage, so your weapon can delevel if you suck it up. Each stage is timed, with a par time, though you can finish as slow as you want. You can collect money to spend on things you find. You can find many extra items that work as temporary increased crit chance, a weapon, etc.. Some pickups increase and decrease difficulty, add armor, damage... Modifications to the weapon can drop from enemies too. Blah blah blah. Just try it already!",

            "review_text": "For a game with 'permadeath' to be tolerable, even enjoyable, there are three conditions that must be met, in my opinion:  1) Each playthrough must have the potential to be a unique experience.  On this point the game only partially succeeds. There is some small variation in level order, with each level made up of a series of several distinct rooms or 'chambers', which are again randomly selected from a pool. However, many of these rooms are similar and it will not take you long to become familiar with all of them.  2) The game must be relatively short  I've reached the 5th level so far and, although this may be close to the end for all I know, it is still too far in to feel entirely happy about starting again from the beginning.  3) The difficulty must be reasonable and consistent throughout.  Now here is where the game utterly FAILS. For most of any particular playthrough of TOG, the difficulty is ridiculously easy. All you have to do is make sure you keep moving while keeping your finger on the fire button. Most of the 'enemies' in the game are in fact static turrets, that fire a bazillion intimidating-looking missiles in your direction, but at an unfeasably slow pace and with no sense of movement anticipation. Once you have the targets in your sights it is actually a pretty dull experience.  However, due to to a certain portion of the enemies (turrets) spawning in random positions, there is often a moment of frenetic insanity when you first enter a room where you are bombarded from what seems like all directions. In most cases it just takes a split second to figure out where the barrages are coming from, find something to hide behind or which direction to move in to dodge the bullets, and it's a dull cakewalk again. But in that split second, if you find your view blocked by the ostensibly quaint, but actually quite obnoxious and distracting 2D smoke and explosion effects, and happen to run in the wrong direction, you are liable to recieve a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of damage all in the one moment and DIE. And start again. From the beginning. When it really isn't even your fault.  The game has some quirky humour, plenty of easter eggs to find and a generally appealing steampunk-esque look and feel. But there is no point in this game where you feel your reflexes and cunning have helped you survive. Rather, it alternates between dumb luck when you enter a room and routine clean-up operations once you know where the guns are.  I'd give it about 2-3 hours of gameplay before the novelty gives way to irritation, so not a very good deal.",

NOTE : I got this game for free from a bundle Gift ( It was in a bundle + 2 games for 1$ on humblebunde) and it was also bundled 2 other times than that , 1 at HB also and another at indiegamestand. And you'd think ' oh i got it for free i should be happy ' no i am not ... i am only happy for the trading cards i got from the game   The game's engine is the same as Quake and Painkiller same graphics same everything ... I am not saying they ripped them off but same style if you know what i mean, but not as good.  The game is SO DULL ! its so slow and confusing no not confusing as in ( Omg its so hard ) no its just so incredibly confusing and poorly designed and thought of, it could have been so much more if they just fixed how slow the bullets are moving and the mouse sensitivity missing up with my mouse's speed.  I found it also lame when they tried to mix comedy in the game ( Pizza launcher ) and what not because this game does not appeal to that side at all,   I like using controllers on platformers and fighting games but at this game at no point i even plugged in my controller and it keeps giving me controller buttons ( press A to blah B to bleh Y to Weh X to wah ) i mean thats stupid.. i am using my keyboard and mouse why show me controller buttons ? so if i plugin controller it will show me keyboard buttons ?Oo And again the game is so slow and how the animations of enemies ( guns ) are destroyed and the sound effect and everything its just soooo booring   14.99$ for this game ? Wow .... no ... I really have no idea why this game has so many positive reviews they probably got it from the bundle because if they paid full price they'd be mad I guess.  If you want to try this game out , wait for another bundle the price tag is waaaaaaaaay too much for this game  I am sorry this is how I feel about this game - Its slow and dull - Its confusing and not fun at all. - Feels like playing a sad version of quake or painkiller. - Physx based game that uses Dx9 Win32bit system ...... - Poor choice of weapons and movement and style and animation and pretty much everything  This could have been so much more if they redo it all over again and not suck this time ...   0/10 ",

All for the better. It features premade levels connected in a random way, much like ziggurat. You shoot a lot of turrets and slow moving robotic enemies. Music is good. Graphics do the job well, and it has it's own look. I recommend a high framerate for this game, so if you are not getting 60-100fps maybe turn down off ssao or something. It does not make a big impact in this game.   My major complaint, and it's a big one, is that the weapons level up way too quickly, and you are barely finished the first level when you are maxxed out. This makes the rest of the playthrough feel weirdly pointless. Sure you can still get score and unlocks, which carry across deaths - however a progressive rpg mechanic is needed to keep a single playthrough fresh. This game drops the ball when it comes to that.   If it had a system that made a single playthrough feel like you where constantly getting more powerful right until you reach the end, then this game would get a 9/10. As it is. 7/10",

Tower of Guns is an indie made game that was recently published earlier this March after a year in being developed. In it, your only objective is to make your way through 15 floors to the top of the tower. Sounds easy? Well it would be, if it wasnt for all the guns trying to mow you over. Each floor is randomized, giving you the element of surprise and wonder as bullets, saw blades plasma, spikes, cannons and a whole lotta other stuff tries to kill you. At the end of each floor, you face down a boss, which is also randomized. Hopefully you dont take death too seriously, because not only will it happen, but you are tallied for it to boot. Its not like death is important or anything, right? :D  This doesnt mean you are entirely weak. Items and powerups you may find from beaten bosses, enemies, or capsules you cant open without enough money (also beaten from enemies) will offer a variety of upgrades to you or your weapon, which are also randomized. Sometimes you might score a good one, sometimes you wont, and sometimes you wont find any. The more you play, the more you can unlock. Collect all the different gun abilities, achieve perks and guns depending on what you do, level up your gun by collecting the blue orbs and stay alive by collecting the red orbs from fallen enemies, and get to the top of that tower!  Tower of Guns is a thrilling rush for its worth. I highly recommend taking it for a spin, because if the whole 'Tower of Guns' thing doesnt appeal to you, you really are missing out dear viewer. Just remember to never be a sitting duck and keep your eyes open for anything. Theres a lot of flashing and a lot of bullets coming your way, so be ready for the biggest barrage from all sides coming your way! Also, be creative; You arent given any sort of instructions on 'how to play', so if you see something interesting, follow up on it, it might take you to a secret, and there are a lot of secrets on each floor.  So go buy it. Do it! Do it now!",

This game still leaves a lot to be desired such as more variety in the machines that spawn, the maps, and the boss's, even with those that are sure to come with future updates (if they update it hopefully). the design of the game is amazingly placed, while the textures and art work reminds me a lot of Borderlands textures to an extent while still being diffrent.

One of the only trouble I have is with the drops you get from your kill... it's unfair sometime how impossible it is to actually get anything your enemies drop especially when you are near lava in the middle of a big fight or on a tight ledge with grinders that crush you mercilessly if you make one step a little bit on the side. Also there's the bullets that may cause some trouble when you try to get your loot but that's because the maze is made of bullets!  The story should be narrated since you don't really have time to read anything... and they don't give you enough time to read. Some option to give more time to read dialogues would be nice.  The boss battles are really well done. You can feel the menace emanating from those deadly contraptions and I have only beaten like 3 or 4 of them so far. Can't wait to see the lease one of them.  The music is excellent, you need to listen to it for yourself to believe it but it fits perfectly with the game. You can hear some of it in the preview video if you doubt my words.  Right now the price is a bit step for a single fps game (15$) but this one offers a lot so if you've got the money it's worth encouraging this kind of gaming industry.   8/10",

            "review_text": "[WARNING: Wall of Text]  Tower of Guns isn't for everyone. And by everyone I mean those thinking that the game is first an FPS, and second a roguelite. ToG is a roguelite that also just happens to be an FPS. You don't have those newfangled mechanics that all the CoDs and Battlefields have. No head sway, no pretty speedy blurring.  So what makes it a good game? It's a bullet hell/ballet hyper-shooter with permadeath, randomly pieced together dungeon levels and a random spawn of enemies, all picked from a pool of pre-rendered assets. It's hard to describe so think of it this way: Binding of Isaac meets Ziggurat. It's very much in that genre. If you love those games, I'd suggest you stop reading this and buy Tower of Guns.  What's under the hood? The FPS aspect is very last generation. It's smooth camera movements and strafing. There is no run button. No crouch button. You get jump and aim and that's it. The formula is simple and it just works.  When you start, you get to choose between 2 guns and 2 perks. You unlock more based on different activities. Die ten times and unlock easy mode perk, finish a stage without taking damage and get the Hand Cannon. (It's literally a cannon you hold with your hand.) There are 10 guns and 10 perks and random gun drops during play.  Upgrades are similar to Binding of Isaac. You get permanent stat increases or decreases. They are buyable or they drop. You get random drop rechargeable items. Giant, slow moving death missiles, laser grids, blocks of goo, and even one that turns you into a human turret. Then you get an always on upgrade. Bouncing bullets, exploding bullets and spread shot among others  Each level offered a randomly picked set of rooms with procedurally generated mob placements. The enemies are numerous and ridiculous. There are bullets. Lots and lots of bullets. There are walls of cannons, rotating turrets that shoot heat sinking missiles, sawblade bots, exploding bots, flying tanks and propeller cannon ceilings. There are so many bullets flying at you at any time that you might just actually crap your pants.   The game really opens up as a ballet of enemy dodging and killing when you start to get jump modifiers. Double- and triple-jumps make the game come into it's own. If you don't get it by now, this isn't a traditional shooter at all. You can potentially jump so much that you stay airborne for 45 seconds. I know this because there is an achievement.  If you like the design of Isaac with the stackable upgrade system, and the feel of Ziggurat, this game is right for you.  My only real complaint is that I had too good of a run and unlocked a lot at once. RNG killed a bit of the replay for me, sadly. Also a system similar to Isaac's main weapon upgrade might make this game that much more awesome. You pick a gun and you are stuck with it. It does level up and each level adds some new perk ot it but you don't get to puke fountains pf blood at your enemies like Azazel.  TL:DR; This is a perfect short spurt, coffee-break roguelite for those who like Isaac, Ziggurat and walls of bullet hell.",
