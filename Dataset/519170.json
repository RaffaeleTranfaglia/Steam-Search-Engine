I appreciate what you're trying to do as a single developer and applaud you for it, I imagine it isn't easy, but it wouldn't be fair to you and your goals in game development if I wasn't honest and sincere about your work...  I see what you were trying to do with the game but there isn't much here. I understand it's your first project, but here were a couple things I came across.  - The voice acting all sounded like it was the same voice actor and just sounded like someone was just reading a piece of paper for all of it, as if they weren't trying to make it sound believable. - There's not much to do in your game in terms of content; I stood on a planet and I threw a ball.. that's it - Unless reading the game description I would not have understood what the story was.  Here's what I applaud you for doing  + You're doing something in game development, keep it up!! Keep your dreams going! + Your story was something I wish had more depth!! Good choice. + Thank you for allowing the community to try your project. + Being on the planet was pretty, would have been awesome if I could move around on it.  I don't want to come across too harsh, but I love the fact that there are people like you trying to make products for people like us. Thank you so much for your support in the Vive community and I look forward to seeing what else you do.",
