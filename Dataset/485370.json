            "review_text": "THIS GAME IS SO LIT. Me and my friends have had an awesome time playing this game, but we all really hope that the developers will add more modes and destructibility into the game. When I say destructible I don't mean full scale levolution like in battlefield, im talking about simple things like having a street light fall over instead of stopping the car when you hit it. Also, I really like the point system where you can earn more points in game to get cool cosmetics. All in all, this was the best 59 cents I have ever spent!",
