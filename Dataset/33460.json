            "review_text": "I FIXED IT!  To everyone that keeps saying that Uplay crashes and that you can't play this is what you need to do: 1) Uninstall the game and Uplay (AKA Ubisoft Launcher) 2) Install Uplay from Ubisoft's site. 3) Login with your account (on Uplay) and make sure you're online. 3.1) There is an option to activate game, choose it. 3.2) Copy the game's activation code to it (the one Steam provides you) 3.3) It will ask you if you want to activate From Dust to that account, choose yes. 4) In Uplay, choose 'Go Offline', and that's it (but don't close Uplay). 6) Install the game on Steam and play Note: In Uplay's settings I recommend that you choose 'Always start Offline' and disable any synchronization to Uplay (specially the save files), because it is absolute garbage, you should also disable overlay.  For those wondering, the problem is the interaction between Steam and Uplay, and the fix is launching (and installing) Uplay by itself instead of letting Steam do it.  The game itself is a lot of fun, it sucks that Ubisoft had to ruin it, I would recommend the game, but not the company.",

            "review_text": "I don't play a lot of 'God games' but for me From Dust was fresh and different. Tasked with guiding a primitive tribe on a quest for answers about their past you are given control of the environment, picking up dirt, water, and lava, to clear paths or build them, while fighting off nature itself.  Visually From Dust is appealing with beautiful tropical islands to arid deserts and lava crusted mountains. The way your powers mold the environment also looks very good. The campaign is just about the right length with a lot of extra content in challenges or open worlds if you're craving more in the end.  For the most part everything works as expected. Occasionally you will drown or burn some of your people but almost always it's because of your own mistake. That being said, occasionally the AI has some pathing issues that lead them into unnecessary danger and get them killed. More common though is having trouble telling where the AI will allow you to go, mostly involving how steep a slope they will walk up. This can cause problems when you think you have a clear path but the AI refuses to move and reverts to complaining about how much they are now on fire. It was never bad enough for me to make me stop playing though.  From Dust is a nice change of scenery and play style that is definitely worth your time.",

Beyond uPlay this game is fantastic. With the completely terraformable worlds and amazing powers and gameplay its a definite buy in my opinion. I personally like the water physics most. Its just very intricate and well scripted, even on a large scale when the lakes and tsunamis are involved. And who can resist taking a large glob of lava and setting your village on fire?",

            "review_text": "A rather short game but fun all the way down. It is as fascinating to watch as it is to play. The fantastic idea gives you the power of being the protective creator of a tribal group of people by modelling nature and landscapes. Even if the main action of piling up and excavating the level's territory may not sound spectacular, I already played it through several times. Not least this is due to the physics which grant sensible effects from all my godlike actions. You have the power over lava, earth and water with which you can shape the landscape in favour of the tribe. The goal is to create a save passage over the map to some ruins which grant access to the next scenario. In this sandbox nature is your persistent opponent. If you are not careful fire burns your village down or flood washes your people away.  A real downside of this game is the story. Actually there is no notable plot which could be called a storyline. Other than the campaign you can also play in custom empty map where you can build your own landscapes. It has also to be stated, that the game requires UPlay since it is an Ubisoft game.  So it is a game that is different. Unfortunately it is not complete, neither by its extent nor by its plot. Nontheless, it reminded me as well of endless hours in the sandpit during childhood. Not least thanks to the still pretty graphics I recommend this terraforming god game.",

            "review_text": "First and foremost, as of this review I had no issue installing or playing this game on PC. I played the game on Xbox 360 prior to purchasing on PC.  The engine behind this game is something spectacular. The ability to manipulate sand, water, and lava is definitely a really fun mechanic. Rivers will flow dynamically in sand, creating their own path and carving their way into the world (with or without your help). Lava will flow and harden into rock which allows for various other uses throughout the game. Sand will spread out over the terrain in a natural soft and smooth manner.  The game is pretty simple, your ultimate goal on each level is to move to the next level. In order to move on, you need to unlock totems. The totems grant additional powers as well as more villages and people. Of course, each totem may have their own challenge to obtain, such as raising the land out of water or using lava to help secure it from threats. There are side objectives to the game, such as collection these minor totems and filling the land completely with vegetation.   Although manipulating the elements is fun, it leaves a strong desire for more. Thinking back to games such as Populous: The Beginning, this engine could be so much more in the right hands and it's sad that it's not being used for something greater. Ultimately, expect to get several fun hours of this game, but if you're like me, you'll thirst for something more. If you haven't played Populous, it's over on GOG for $6, which may give you many more hours of a God game experience for less dollars spent.",

Some levels are frustrating, but the game never stops being fun or exciting. The final level is pretty much free mode, you get a big blank slate and all of the important powers (water, lava/stone, dirt, plants) and they let you go nuts. Do not resist the urge to make a giant stone ♥♥♥♥♥.",

It has such a good multiplayer community, dudes only of course, some of the greatest Multiplayer PvP maps I have seen, and of course, who could forget the sweet graphics this game includes. Now I do now know how to type out how amazing these graphics are. But I'll give it my best shot. These graphics are Real Life. The playstyle is amazing. I love the first person shooter aspect.

Eric Chahi is a gaming genius and I wish he made more games. From Dust is a worthy entry in the sandbox god-game genre. It's not another Populous if that's what you're looking for here, it's a game about a deity that protects its tribe against the forces of nature as they trace their heritage across a harsh world. It's admittedly short but that saves it from overstaying its welcome. It's novel and fun, and the visuals are something you just have to experience. You will not regret playing this game.",

            "review_text": "God Games have always been one which you've have the overall power the wield the world at your fingertips, with each God Game type having their own different style to give, showing the emphasis of what type of god you are in that specific universe. Sometimes the wielding of nature (which is most common in god games) is used to a much greater advantage, one of which provides the player to have much more strategy that simply clicking on the environment. From Dust perfectly does this.   From Dust developed by Ubisoft is a game where you play as a deity which has the power to shift the lands underneath the native people's feet for their own means of survival. From Dust's story synopsis is about a group of native in which their land is torn by the natural causes, until they summon their god (the player) to help them strive to a new land in which they may find a peaceful location to settle on with any nature causes harming their colony.   The Story is told through a more native style tale which help give a more tribal and authentic feel to the games' art style, with such a story it can be consider to have contain a hidden message or parable. (Though I'll overlook that)  The gameplay is pretty much like other god games. You have to move around the natural element of the world to help suit the needs of the native people, to get from point A to B, which 'B' is a tunnel to the next level. The native people set up camp near a tribal totem pole in which it gives you various additional power to prevent natural disasters or pave way to an exit. This is the games' strongest point: the powers that the player has. The game makes it clear that you can grab and bend the natural element to your will. Ubisoft was clever with this technique as each level gives a limited amount of supply of a certain element. This is to make you strategise the current situation and makes you focus on rationing certain elements. Sometimes they give too much of an element and its up to the player to prevent that specific element destroy the tribes people. Sometimes this can done through kites which give special powers prevent certain elements from destroying the tribe.   The art style of the game is somewhat unique, in that it uses more tribal colours and texture which exist in more tropical environments, like Hawaii and Togo. The graphics are technically well designed with very little glitches or flaws that exist within the game.   The flaws that exist within the game are the sometimes unfairness of a certain level, elements attacking the tribe too quickly and giving a game over. Another is the AI which has a lack of pathfinding when going to a location which is perfect valid with no obstacles in the way. Last but not least is the somewhat lack of a sandbox mode or more time to use your creative skill in building nature constructs. Personally I had a great time using some elements to create damns and bridges, changing the flows of certain elements is what is highly enriching besides the strategy element of the game.  Overall From Dust is a great game which I highly recommend to anyone who loves God Games and want a bit more strategy as well.   7.75/10.0 (Very Good)",

The whole idea that you help a group of villagers as a powerful spirit is a fresh concept. However, the problem with this game is that I had a lot of difficulty with the controls for the game. Either the avatar would move too much for delicate movements and then hardly at all for broad movements. This makes manipulating the environment exceptionally difficult, especially in areas with running water. Overall, great concept but poor implementation. 1.5/10 (June 11th edit) I'd like to make a note here that I tried playing this game again, but only with a controller. As soon as I began using that, I noticed that the sensitivity issuses disappeared. It's now obvious to me that this game was developed with XBLA in mind and not the PC. That being said. It's still kind of fraustraing.",

None of the levels are terribly difficult. The controls leave a bit to be desired and the lack of video options (the game looks low-end hd and doesn't scale) is a poorly conceived corner to cut.   _______________________________________________________________________________  Don't buy it yet.
