            "review_text": "For the money this is being sold at it is a 'good casual game' if you have an interest in Gladiator combat, a sadly lacking area in gaming. Also, the developer is actively supporting the community by interacting with gamers, noting improvements and providing these where they make sense (e.g. Weapons were a welcome addition). This is an attribute to be supportive of, as some developers will leave gamers with poorly finished products or not engage the paying customers.  The game:   You are the 'manager' of a group of gladiators, and have to prepare them for fights, choose who fights and instruct them how they will fight (defensively, normally, or aggressively, or try for specific attacks to make the opponent bleed).   The fights are text based, and the interface is primarly text and statistical based. If you like very strong graphics or controlling characters in first person, this is NOT the game for you. This IS the game if you like 'simulated management' of the gladiators only, where you choose actions on a turn by turn basis, in what is quite a basic interface but cleanly developed (and hence the price because it is quite basic and casual, yet easy to learn and a little addictive).  Positives:  Beautiful intro with nice opening graphic and strong music.  You split your managerial skills between Loyalty, Performance, Development and Healing, and are assigned with a selection of Gladiators, making for a uniuqe team each game.  If your gladiator is not in combat, you can send them to training or on a quest to imrpove their skills (but you dont get to do any other action while they participate in these events or see what they actually do in great detail).  Choose who will fight each battle, they will participate in a league of gladiators. If you choose to try and play dirty you can bribe your opponent to fight worse, or, buy special brews for your gladiators.  A nice side game is a betting game, where you place money on other matches on who will win, based on their statistics.  You can upgrade an arena if you achieve certain levels, get bonuses for winning certain levels, and advertise to increase attendance and revenue at the arena. Sometimes there's a chance the 'king' may attend your fight.  Some random events can occur in battles, e.g. lions may appear once a season or so.  Tip :   - Be sure to use the ? help button on each screen on first playthrough and read carefully to understand the game and mechanics.   - The first battle was over so quickly I wondered what was going on as the text appeared far too quickly. So I went to the settings and changed the settings so that a manual pogression of text was required, a much slower and enjoyable experience.   Development required:  Needs steam achievements.  Hope to see more overall improvements and features to improve the depth of the game. One idea, possibly armour? Switchable equipment.   I wondered what period this was actually trying to replicate, then I realised it's more of a 'fantasy setting' gladiator combat game, and doesn't really reference histroy with historical accurateness. If you don't mind this, you can overlook this fact and focus on the gameplay, as the designer wanted to focus on the game of fighting more than the history I believe.  ",

            "review_text": "For $5, its a fun casual game that I have no regret buying.  Having people give feedback on 'your vision' just because it doesnt meet their expectation has to be hard (annoying even). The promptness of the responses has been very positive, and I can only imagine the game getting better as more people play and give their feedback and ideas.  I can happily recommend this game to anyone who likes a management game.    ",

            "review_text": "Very complete text based gladiator (micro-)managing and fighting game.  You can choose the upgrade your arena, bribe people, upgrade gladiators. You can choose who will be your main gladiator and give them training so they will perform better next match. You do make an income from betting on matches. Who would have thought that this game would even include betting ?  The game has so much information available about everything available that's it's difficult to sum up everything. If you want an almost endless amount of options, this game has it.  Even the text based arena fighting has been done nicely. I was able to loose my gladiator on the first day.   I do miss seeing gladiators fighting without having to read the text about their fights. I guess this is not the game for it.  I'd give it a 7/10  A key was kindly provided for review purposes.",

            "review_text": "Really good concept. Very surprised that so few Gladiator sim management games exists with the popularity of movies and shows revolving around them. This game is very simple, and does have an active developer. It has muuch room for exansion, tweaking and enhancement. There is a few visual optimizations that eed to be done, mostly involving the game not fitting windows correctly and causing some UI problems (Like trying to find where to click, Haven't compared i t to the other similar game 'Age Of Gladiatiors' which also on Steam (Really cutting back on Steam purchases due to this market authenticator nonsense, so mostly only purchasing games from legit key sites, and the other simulator hasn't appeared on any of those yet TMK). But back to this one. It's pretty fun desite the little UI probs. Does get immersive and I'm enjoying it so far. Certainly worth the small price if you are into sims. Hopefully one day a seriously immersive one (Breeding..lol, personality, more stats, weapons, and so forth will come along one day). So I so reccomend it , for this price and it's casual nature. It can at least give you a small genre fix...and with continued support perhaps the Dev willl exand, tweak and continue improvements.",
