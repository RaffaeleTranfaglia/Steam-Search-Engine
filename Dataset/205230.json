            "review_text": "  In the spirit of joining my fellow SEGA Nerds teammates, I decided to join the Annual SEGA Horror Fest with a review. While I may not be the most appropriate person to talk about Halloween, since we don’t celebrate it in my country, I tried to choose a title that’s more related to our “Día de los Muertos” (Day of the Dead), our national holiday that embraces our joy for life, the cult and nostalgia for our departed ones and also… to poke fun at death.  Precisely, that’s what Arkedo’s Hell Yeah! Wrath of the Dead Rabbit does, poke fun at death, hell, and some other spooky things on the way. While French developers, Arkedo, might be long gone as a studio after a financial bankruptcy (should I dedicate a Mexican Día de los Muertos “Ofrenda” perhaps?), they certainly made games that were appreciated in a special way by some people (like Nervous Brickdown or Big Bang Mini for the Ninty DS).  A RESURRECTION FOR A PLATFORMER?   For a start Hell Yeah! is a platformer, a genre that many thought dead but that’s been slowly coming back thanks to the necromancy of retro gaming. You control Ash, hell’s current underworld ruler, who is trying to hunt down some of his minions that are threatening him with releasing compromising photos to the public. As fun and weird as the plot sounds this translates into comedic and bizarre interruptions or mini games that appear as you progress though mazes in the underground, perhaps this is a double edge sword, cause while some of us SEGA fans might fall into the gag and follow by, some others might get desperate trying to know what’s going on, because the game is not very intuitive in explaining these “on the go” mechanics. For example, some bosses require to aim and shoot as a mini game, but some people might not get how to do it, cause the game does not do a very good job on explaining so or that it is part of a gag.  For most, the game has a lot of fun to offer, but also requires to master some skill, since the controls require you to switch between sticks to aim for certain parts or to zoom out the screen to aim and hit some enemies.  SOMETHING FOR THE SEGA FANS  The game has a lot of fanservice for the average SEGA fans. As you progress in the game you unlock SEGA Character themed add-ons like JSR or Shinobi hats or items, you can also equip your attacking wheel with more weapons or features. There are also other fun hubs like your own island were you send your defeated enemies and punish them as it must due!  A KILLER OST AND VISUALS TO DIE FOR  There are 2 things that outstand in this game, its vector based visuals &amp; character designs and its amazing OST. The vector artwork shines so well in this game and allows you to enjoy the aesthetics no matter the resolution, specially in PC, Arkedo did a great job. The OST is something to enjoy on its own, even if you don’t buy the game you can still download this awesome score, it has something for almost everyone, from lullabies to hardcore punk, and every tune fits perfectly in the game.  SUMMARY  This game is fun and enjoyable, but might not be appropriate for the narrow minded player. While its true that pretty visuals and a good OST are not all in a game, the title lacks of some areas to be polished like a more polished gameplay and controls.  Pros:  + Amazing visuals and OST + Fanservice for the SEGA fans + Fun times and fart-type jokes  Cons:  – Not for everyone – Requires control skill – Lacks of explanation for some mechanics",

And hats. Each mini-boss is taken down in a different QTE mini-moment (think seconds of play &amp; flash style over the top sequences as a result).  I love it so far. I expect to hit a difficulty spike &amp; change that opinon, but so far, I'm digging it. I can understand why Sega took a punt on it - there's a lot of good stuff in this one &amp; obviously a lot of care/love from the developer.",

The dialougue and art style are amazing, the controls are tight, the feeling is correct for the setting (comically morbid) and the overall gameplay is fantastic.

You become their HR manager, essentially, and keeping them happy and productive nets you food (health items), money, bonuses and more. It's kinda its own game within the game and I can see people easily getting attached to that half.   Cons: -Not a problem for myself, but some people may be turned off by the crude humor (I think there is a menstruation joke, but I wasn't quite sure. The nurse character? Anyone else?) -Level layouts sometimes seem haphazard and not really planned. (Not a major issue for me, and I'm about an hour in at this point)",

The worst part about it all is that I enjoy the basic concept. It's completely lost on this unfocused ludicrousness. If the art direction were more palatable and refined a bit (right now I'd describe the level appearances as borderline 5 year old, sugar rush, fever nightmare. Especially the 'Cute' and 'Club' levels), some of the mini-games a bit more clear and not detrimental to your health bar upon failure, and just one writer at Sega or Arkedo had a likable sense of humor, this game would be a sleeper hit.   It would have been a gem if they could have blended Metroid-vania level design with fun Warioware style mini-games to break the flow.   But no. This game bombards your brain with idiotic dialogue, collectibles that are a chore to collect, and brings you so very close to liking it before it curb stomps your hopes and enthusiams for it to be at least a mediocre game. It's almost a crime to put out something that could have just used 2 or 3 more months of development and clean ups.   Maybe if Sega/Arkedo gave a rabbit's ♥♥♥ about it, they'd patch it occasionally.

            "review_text": "  I'm not going to beat around the bush here. This game is not good, and it is quite the example of false advertising. In fact, I'd rather go to Hell than be forced to play this game again.   This game appears to be targeted to the 'I'm 14, I play Five Nights at Freddy's and I'm so edgy and random lolz rawr XD' crowd. Everything revolves around this motif. The protagonist is a cartoon skeleton rabbit that shoots his way through a Hell, flled with more cartoon animals. The artwork looks like doodles in a notebook, and the sound effects and music do not particularly fit with the theme and the concept. Listening to 'The Crunge' or 'D'yer Mak'er' on repeat for a few hours is a far more fitting soundtrack. At least the memebers of Led Zeppelin realized how ridculous these songs are, which maes them enjoyable. The game developers, however, lacked this self awareness. The unskippable and repititive dialogue (more on that in a moment) is filled with bad one liners and attempt to be funny. You know when an adult tries to be relatable and cool? This game does exactly that. In fact, I'm surprised that Hillary Clinton hasn't used it as part of her strategy to reach out to millenials (this is not a political post please don't attack me Valve mods).  The actual gameplay itself is marred by several serious flaws. The controls are incredibly awkward, and they somehow feel both stiff and slippery. It feels like someone coated the character in cold butter and threw him onto an ice skating rink. I know that WASD is not great for platformers, but it still is so strange. The rabbit has trouble dodging objects in mid air, which is something you need to be able to do well in order to advance in this game. He also seems to slide after you let go of the movement keys, which has gotten me killeed multiple times.   I tried using a controller, as the game promised controller support, but guess what? IT DIDN'T WORK. I even tried it with multiple controllers, so I am sure it is not a problem on my end. With a controller, I couldn't jump or shoot. These are the two things you need to be able to do in order to play the game. I tried remapping the buttons in the options, but it wouldn't let me. This false advertising irritates me, and I'm suprised at how many games keep doing it.  Speaking of options, the option menu is absolutely pitiful. There are two options from what I remember. These are very basic keyboard remapping (no controller for you, peasants) and the option to change the sound from stereo to mono. That's right, no opton for changing the graphics settings. The game runs at a constant 720p, and upscales to your resolution. It already looks strangely upscaled on my 1080p screen, so I'd hate to see it on a 1440p or 4K monitor.  The action in the game is very mediocre. You get to choose between a variety of weapons, such as a sawblade, a rocket launcher, grenades, and assault rifle, etc.. The only problem is, however, the game restricts weapons to specific enemies. This only raises the question: WHY EVEN HAVE WEAPON VARIETY IN THE FIRST PLACE?! It's a pitiful attempt at diversity and longevity that I cannot appreciate. The whole gimmick with the bosses is that once you defeat them, you get to play a minigame to watch a gory death animation. These come in two varieties. You get to mash a button, you you get to hit a button at just the right time. These animations are reallly just glorified quick-time events. The horse is dead far before this game stops beating it.  These issues are made even worse with the fact that there is no post hit invincibility. If this was just restricted to a certain game mode, I'd be fine with that. But, ths lack of protection makes the bad controls even worse. You can be bounced all around the map and quickly go from 250 to 0 in a matter of seconds. It is downright infuriating how cheap this game can be because of it.  The godawful cutscenes are another issue. I mentioned that they were repetitive and unskippable. I stopped paying attention because every dialogue feels the same. Ash is a teenage punk, and talks back to authority figure because he is so edgy. It gets old quick. Also, you can't skip them. You just have to mash the mouse in order to go through as quickly as possible. There isn't even voice acting. IT's just reading. I don't mind reading, but if I wanted to read, I would grab a book. Also if you die during a boss fight, which you most certainly will beause if the garbage controls. you will often be forced to go through the dialogue you just read again. This is so annoying, and I hate it when developers don't fix this issue. No one wants to read your stupid text bubbles again.  Overall, the game tries to be something that it's not. It tires to be a cool, edgy game with a unique feeling and concept, but it falls flat on its face with boorish storytelling and incompetent implementation. In fact, it eerily reminds me of Shadow The Hedghog. Both games star male animal protagonists that shoot and kill their way through dark, gritty, yet cartoony settings. They each have notoriously bad controls and serious game design issues. To give it that extra touch of cringe, both were published by none other than SEGA. You'd they they'd learn after their first try at such a game. Overall, I give it a 4/10. Maybe I'm just being too critical. After all, it is only a SEGA game that I got for free.  However, if you are one of those 14 year olds I was talking about...  10/10 edgiest game I've ever played  CRAWLING IN MY SKIN",

You'll have your fingers sprawled on a hundred different things (which I know is sometimes really preferrable but ehem, not in this case) despite the fact that the game itself is fairly simple.

At it's core it's a fun little platformer with solid 2D graphics , but the deeper into the rabbit hole you go the more tedious it becomes.   In the latter half of the game instakill spikes litter the walls, ground and ceiling. Checkpoints and healthstations can be painfully far apart, and the only real reward you get for murdering bosses is opening gates to go do more of it. The quick time events you must complete in order to kill a boss after you widdle their health down can range from simple to mind numbingly aggravating. Sometimes you'll fight a boss till you're near death only for the quicktime event to be a demanding one you've never seen before, usually ending in you failing and having to start the battle over again from the last level checkpoint.   For the most part the only reason to collect currency is to buy costumes, as most of the weapons are unlocked with story progression.  Had this actually come down in price over the 2 1/2 years since it's release I'd recommend it, but to this day apart from the odd sale it sits on the store glaring at customers for not wanting to shell out $15 for some hit and miss gameplay.   At the end of the day the tedium of the latter half of the game prevents me from recommending it for anything other than a $5 sale.",

Its kinda disappointing because even from what conflicting things I'd heard and the appealing art style its a little bland. If its on sale I wouldn't get it, honestly. I got it from the MWNL 3 bundle on the first day and I'm glad I didn't buy it full price. The other thing is, the VR Missions are boring for being DLC.",
