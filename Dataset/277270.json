            "review_text": "What I loved about RtMI 2 is that it brings back something from the olden days that point-and-click adventure games seem to have somehow lost along the way. It has puzzles that aren't just about mashing buttons and randomly clicking everything you see on-screen, they actually make sense and you have to put some real thought into solving them. I like how it gives you multiple possibilities in terms of combining the items in your inventory not just the classic 'nothing else will fit' approach.  *** RtMI allows you to play as a monkey for Pete's sake. As a monkey.",

            "review_text": "The first game is WONDERFUL. Refreshing, great puzzles (although you might need a walkthrough for all the combinations), great cutscenes and graphics and a great ending, maybe a fitting ending to the game and not to leave room for a sequel. The second one, this one, is like the first - except someone decided to take the first and sh** all over it. First of all, the voice acting. This woman is ideal as Kate Walker from the Syberia series, but in this one, it's like a hotline for doctors; 'now I need my bandage' she says, in an all seductive voice. There is also the WORST kind of puzzle: eating. As a castaway, you CANNOT be expecting a full course. So, when you offer the characters a raw egg TWICE, they will say 'No, not this, I need something else for a change.' You ARE ON A F****** ISLAND, YOU STUPID B****. Let me send a buffet, hold on. And those 'energy bars'. Fill them up, but don't give them TWO raw eggs no no no... Also, I wish there was an option where you WOULD NOT have to see the characters blink and watch you move, eat, talk to your cellphone and other activities... Creepy.  Furthermore, the ending SUCKS. There are two ways to end the game and the one sucks so much I'm not even going to write it.  On the positive side, there are many new locations and a lot to explore. So, if you are looking for a game to smash your nerves to pieces and make you hate adventure gaming, it's here. Thank you Microids. You officialy SUCK.",

            "review_text": "Follows on directly from the previous game's story. A chilled out, intelligent, adventure in the jungle, with a focus on life and the environment rather than bang-bang-you're-dead. MacGyver style object manipulation and combination puzzles; has a distinct feel of Myst about it. Longer and more complex than the original game, a sequel that genuinely grew and improved on the original.",
