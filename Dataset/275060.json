            "review_text": "Aaaaaaaand just like that they killed the last hope for the Alone in the Dark Franchise.  Now I've never written an actual review before but this is the game that made me have to do it. That's how bad it is. I recieved this a couple months ago, when they sent out closed BETA invites and was excited to see a new Alone in the Dark coming. I wasn't even aware that a new one was being produced so I became excited. So I redeemed the key and downloaded it and then opened it thinking I'd relive the horror and terror that the other Alone in the Darks caused me to have.   What I got was a co-op Wave Based game. Nothing scary about this particular game. They basically Resident Evil 6'd this game. It is definitely not a survival horror game. It is an action objective based wave game. You go around fully armed to the teeth and killing the creatures of the darkness. There's no sense of fear when you have an assault rifle with a flamethrower attached to it while dual wielding revolvers.  Now I'm not just going to bash this game because there are some cool things to this game, believe it or not. Here they are.   1. The lighting is kinda cool.    So that concludes my review of this game so do your best avoid spending any money on this particular game.  Dicated but not Read,  codybear93",

This is like a combination of Resident Evil 4, Left 4 Dead, and Alan Wake, except terrible in every way. It's a Co-op shooter, but good luck finding anyone to play with. The controls are stiff and awkward, it all feels very dated. The guns feel just horrible. No recoil, no feedback or anything. There's also serious lack of guns. The enemy AI is just terrible, don't think I've actually played a game with worse AI. Everything is glitchy. On max settings the game looks bad and there's ridiculous pop-in. This is exactly my type of game, and I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. I really wanted it to be good.",

            "review_text": "I'm going to go against the general opinion here when I say that I do recommend this game, at least, I do since the June 2016 patch.  Alone In The Dark: Illumination suffers from one major design flaw that's caused it garner such hate from it's audience... the fact that it's called Alone In The Dark. Whilst I am a small fan of the AITD franchise, I am also open-minded when first playing a video game and play them without expectations or immediate judgement. Alone In The Dark this game certainly is not, as it features nothing of the tropes that the franchise normally features, what it IS though is a competant and fun third-person horror/action game.  You enter the game with a selection of 4 playable characters, each with their own unique skills and weaponry. as you progress through the game, you gain XP resulting in level ups, that award skill points to bolster your abilities to take on tougher challenges.  Visually, the game doesn't look too bad. It's not bleeding-edge top-of-the-line graphics, but it's good enough for the atmosphere the game creates. Audio too is done quite well, players will often find themselves thrown off by the sounds of the enemies as they distract you from where the attack will come from, and with the player given the story by a narrator that sounds like he's reading from a H.P Lovecraft novel, it all blends together quite nicely. And whilst on the subject, some of the inspiration towards the enemies and story in this game comes straight from Lovecraft, which is a niche more games developers really should capitalise on because there's such great source material.  Gameplay is rather interesting. Enemies are invincible whilst in darkness, leaving your character very weak and vunerable to them if they should get close enough or manage to box you in. The only way to fight them is luring them into areas of light, such as lamp-posts, ceiling lights, flood lights, torches, candles etc. Anything that generates light will weaken the enemy and make them killable. This often causes the player to run from one light source to another hoping to always stay ahead of the enemy, and it can create some quite tense moments, especially if you play single-player, as ammunition and pick-ups for your abilities aren't as abundant when you need them the most. Not only that but some light sources will burn out after a minute or so, and since some maps do have you back-tracking to carry things to something else, strategic use of lights along the way is essential.  As mentioned, the June 2016 update greatly improved the state of the game. Upon it's original launch, it had the same problems that Umbrella Corps (which released only a few days ago) currently has. A terrible camera, poor animations, buggy and glitchy hit detection, poor audio, brainless enemy A.I and so on. With the recent patch though, AITD: Illumination now has a significantly better camera, full narration to the story, enemy A.I is actually quite smart, often trying to sneak up on the player or lure them away from the light. As well as that, the skill progression system has seen a complete rework, allowing players to build their chosen character around a playstyle of their choosing, and all the characters have had some kind of change or tweak to them, such as the Witch having her pistol taken away in favour of her ability to shoot lightning and create light orbs.  If you choose to play this game, try and convince a friend or two to give it a go with you, and you'll probably find it to be a lot of fun. Don't start it up thinking it'll be an Alone In The Dark game, instead just see it as a stand-alone third person horror shooter with no ties to existing franchises, and you'll find it to be a very competant game.",
