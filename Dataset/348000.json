            "review_text": "While the developer seems to be trying really hard to make the game better, as of update 2.5.1, the game still has terrible controls (like a phone game - click once to move, twice to run, click on the character and select again to crouch, jump forward or jump).   Cons:  - I could only play the game by moving the executable to the game's main folder. Otherwise, Steam would not even see the .exe file.  - Terrible controls with the mouse (a platformer without controller or keyboard support is a game-breaker for me)  - a horrible bug after dying that made my character get stuck above the checkpoint (I have uploaded a picture to Steam) - bad English (the Continue option means Reload Checkpoint, which does not make sense, just to give an example)  Pros  - nice graphics style - nice audio effects  I really want to play this game, and hope I can change my review in the future.",
