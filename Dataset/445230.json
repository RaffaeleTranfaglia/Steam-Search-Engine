The only thing that's happening is that the characters are telling you 'scary' stories but to be honest, they aren't scary at all. I really love reading but in the end I was just klicking and klicking all the time because I didn't even want to read anymore. But I'd say you need to try it out for yourself, I just find it extremely boring. What I really liked was the design of the characters, they look very cute.",

            "review_text": "So, I neglected playing this title for quite some time. I finally got around to reading it. Finally, my review has come in.   Lost girl's [diary]  is a FREE kinetic visual novel about a few teens and a loli telling campfire stories indoors to pass the time. Instead of it being scary or terrifying as you might expect from the game's description and trailer, it's more tame than you'd think. Sure, the stories can be mildly spooky, but they just aren't scary (and the punchline to the loli's was actually quite funny). They are, however, quite engaging and interesting. The style used to tell the stories was quite well done.  There is, however, an issue with typos and some grammatical errors that you'll notice upon reading this work. Please keep in mind that it's completely developed by Russians and they did their best with the English translation. (Can't blame them for that too much. Of course,  One Manga Day  was also developed by a Russian)  The characters, for the most part, didn't interest me...well, save for a few that is. Sadly, half of their personalities just aren't there and most of their names are forgettable, much like in  One Manga Day  (yes, that game has basically become a bar for comparison for me by now). The portrait work takes a while to get used to, but by the end is quite nice. The CG pictures and the background images are also quite well done. As for the music? Adrian von Ziegler's work(s) manage to make an appearance here, much like from  Elisa: The Innkeeper - Prequel . There's also multiple cues of the Metal Gear alert sound effect. ('!')  Now, I'm kinda' a notorious slow reader, so I ended up clocking in 100 minutes from start to finish with breaks and moments where I needed to re-read some parts. People have managed to skip most of this to get a final time of 0.1 hours, but I feel that many will finish reading it legit in less than 100 minutes. An easy and relatively quick 100% for your list.  7.5/10 Not scary, but really nice. I enjoyed it. (Needs more Lisa. NOW!!!!)",

            "review_text": "Well, we can hardly consider this game, as a game.  It is more like a kids 'scary' book, presented as a succession of pictures. There are only 2 different backgrounds, with characters having different expressions ( let's say, between 3 &amp; 5 per character ) and also 2 differents 'tracks' ( one scary, one normal, if I can say ).  The only thing you have to / can do is clicking and reading the different horror stories ( 7 chapters, one for each character ) and enjoying the reactions of all these russian teenagers.  I just installed it to get the 100% achievements, which only takes around 10 minutes, less if you rush it like a maniac, without even reading a line. Still makes a bit of english practise.",

Some teenagers telling you scary stories about a camp that sounds very similar to the 'Everlasting Summer' camp. Good storytelling? Not really, it was pretty boring too read without any real scares or horror story, which it clearly wanted to be. The music is nothing special and the artwork is nice. Only the very beginning has voice acting after that the game remains silent. (\\Ã´/)",

Let that be a lesson, folks: reading is fundamental! This a kinetic novel, so there are no choices that cause the story to branch out into multiple different endings. Second, this is more of a collection of children's horror stories, along the lines of Are You Afraid Of The Dark? Once I understood what it was I was actually reading, I can say that I was able to enjoy the KN for what it was: a cute and comedic story of a bunch of kids telling scary tales. The artwork was lovely, with the sprites conveying emotions using the full range of body language that also helped convey the personalities of each character. I thought that the sounds and music fit the mood of each scene well, and while the translation definitely needs polish, I've seen worse. This being said, I'm thinking that the KN would definitely benefit from some polish, in order to help make the stories told a bit more coherent. But in all, I thought that this was a very cute children's horror tale, and if you are in the mood for cute children's horror stories, there's no reason not to try this out. It's free, after all!",
