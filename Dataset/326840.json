            "review_text": "  Heart&amp;Slash combines a cube world esc art style with hack and slash mechanics. I really do believe that this game has the potential to become outstanding, sadly in its current form it’s not. Much like Salt, it’s not a bad game, far from it. The game just does so many things wrong that it takes away from the overall experience.   Negatives: Let’s start with my biggest complaint with the game, level design. You will stumble around for ages looking for the end of the level, this is mainly caused by the very confusing and uninspired mini map which gives useful information in the most confusing form possible. The easiest solution to this problem would be to…..well improve said mini map. This way I could see where I’m going without being confused. My next complaint may be considered minor but in my opinion it does become quite aggravating after a while, this issue is that the game does not allow mouse controls in the menu, pause menu or options menu. Instead you will be forced, hand over fist to navigate these menu’s using your arrow keys of all things! On PC I expect that I can use my mouse to swiftly and efficiently change options or navigate through menus if I desire. Not having mouse support in the menus is quite ridiculous in 2016. There are a few more minor things which annoyed me like some random FPS drops here and there, the music gets slightly repetitive after a while and as to be expected a few glitches are in the game. But other than those the game is very fun to play.  Combat I really enjoyed the combat it felt like a real hack and slash game. Left Mouse is your standard hit and Right Mouse is your stun and heavy hit. It’s simple but it fits the game and genre very well! I also really like how well the combat is paced, the developers seemed to have got the perfect speed for their game.   Weapon Variety The combat is really good in Heart&amp;Slash but the weapon variety is even better! I love the fact that I can beat robots to death with a garbage bin lid! I mean what other hack and slash allows you to do that? In the space of 5 minutes you can go from: A garbage bin lid, to thors lightning hammer to a wooden spear to a Rocket Mace! The weapon variety is great as it not only keeps the gameplay fresh but it keeps you interested as you wonder what weapon you’re going to find next, it also helps that the game has an upgrade system which rewards the player for killing x number of robots.  Graphics The Graphics in Heart&amp;Slash are a very nice take on the blocky, pixelated art style we have all seen in games like: Trove, Cube World, Minecraft and more recently Portal Knights. However it isn’t your average Cube World clone in the art department, this game utilises a number of highlight colours to line the textures together, the art style is very well done in my opinion.   Conclusion Overall Heart&amp;Slash is a very fun game which provides a huge variety of weapons, wonderful hack and slash gameplay and a very nice art style, all these things are however let down by: Bad map design, repetitive music, NO mouse controls for menus and a story which feels tacked on.   -JoshuaUpham",

            "review_text": "I adore this game and hell I agree with people saying it's quite like Mega Man Legends even the first few seconds of the menu music sounds similar to Mega Man Legends 2's title theme, but the combat feels like Kingdom Hearts at least for me.   The weapon variety is awesome you can have a shotgun, a sword, and even training weights as your weapons, there's even Zero's z-saber from the Mega Man Zero series. You can have shields too to parry enemies and block. Also the body pieces have their own abilties from a head that targest multiple enemies and shoots homing missiles to a body that allows you to shoot cannon balls to legs that allows you to turn invisible and hide from enemies. There are many combos that you can do with the different weapons which can help you defeat certain enemies with ease.   There are some nintendo easter eggs as well.  This game is meant to be played with a controller. I find it quite hard to control when I tried using a mouse and keyboard, but people have their preferences. The camera controls are not a problem for me in my opinion, it seems fine on an Xbox 360 controller.   The story is quite interesting and as a rogue-like it works. The death doesn't feel permanent for me or unfair. I feel like that whenever you die you just get rebuilt in the factory again and again and again until you find a way to destroy Quassy once and for all, that is if you didn't kill a certain someone. Even the game is aware that you're going to have to replay the game again if you talk to that certain character at a certain point. I even noticed a difference in Quassy's dialogue in a second playthrough after defeating him the first time.  There are 2 bosses in each stage except for the last stage and you can take different paths on the map to reach either of those bosses. It doesn't matter which boss you choose to fight, as long as you kill them you're fine.  There are some texture bugs I have seen such as z-fighting on wall textures and on some ground textures, but they are pretty rare for me. The problems I have is when the camera glitches out and stays in one spot as if I'm playing Resident Evil 1 or sometimes the game would freeze completely and all I can do is go to the pause menu and exit to the main menu. These problems might be caused by alt-tabbing though.  Also I forgot to mention how amazing the soundtrack is!  I recommend this game, it's worth the money and your time.",

            "review_text": "My only complaint is that it could use a bit more variety in loot, levels and enemies.  Otherwise this game is my favorite roguelike of all time, it has the BoI room system, A DMC-ish combat system, incredible pixel/voxel 3d artstyle, a nice soundtrack, cheesy story and characters/dialog.  Even though the item variety is not as much as others of the genre, each item is upgradeable and recyclable for health (in case you dont want it or really need health). You can even upgrade yourself.  Your starting items (3) are random, something that seems rare in the genre these days and is very welcome.  The weapon equip is similar to dark souls, there's quick parrying with shields and weapon swap on key hold.  All controls are rebindable on keyboard.",

            "review_text": "I enjoy rougelikes/rougelites. They usually garner a lot of replay value for me. This was a little different.  Before I get to that though, the controls are a bit finicky. Your character is FAST. You get used to it after a while and I actually enjoyed it, but it's jarring to start. The jumping mechanics are a pain more often than not. I'll get stuck on ledges almost every time I jump near them. And hitting flying enemies? Holy cow - pain in the butt. Aside from that, the 'start' and 'map' buttons don't work on the controller 80% of the time. I'll have to use the keyboard when it doesn't feel like working, and even then, I have to press the key twice for it to work.  Okay, now for the gameplay.  First playthrough, I was about 45 minutes in and had to grab something to eat. I had a really good playthrough going so far, and did quite a bit of grinding to upgrade my character, so I was excited to get back into the game after my meal. Whelp, on return, I realized the game does not save your progress.  All fine and dandy, I guess I should have expected that from a rougelite (a warning message like, 'Your progress will be lost' would have been nice, though.) So I started another playthrough. Usually, for a Rougelike/lite, this would be no problem, as starting fresh is half the point. With this game, however, it felt...repetitive. On the 2nd playthrough. I had some new weapons, but they didn't do much to change my playstyle...it felt very much like my first playthrough. In addition, you can only upgrade your character 4(!) times. I didn't feel like I was reaching any new ground. Didn't feel like anything I did was making my current 'build' better...I just had to play better. You can only carry 3 different weapons and 4 pieces of armor (head, body, arms, legs). There are lots of weapons, sure...but a lot of the melee weapons felt very much the same. (One exception, if you get the Vorpal Dagger early in the game, it's the only weapon you'll need. I could beat the game with just that weapon, and nothing else.) The armor can change your play style, but only slightly. They all have varied effects, but all the 'resistance' armor effects seem useless, so you can toss those immediately.  What I expected were weapons that were truely unique - for example, a giant hammer that would knockback enemies or smash them into the ground, breaking shields in the process. Nope - all weapons have the same combo and a launcher type attack. Disappointed in the lack of ability to chain your combos from weapon to weapon too - maybe hit them a few times with a sword, knock them back with a larger weapon, then finish them off with a ranged weapon. As for armor, what if you could put armor together to turn your character into a true tank like character - increasing your size and letting you wade through attacks? What about armor that turns you into a flying mech type character? Nope. My character feels the same no matter what armor I put on him.  A great deal of fun with a rougelike/lite is found in the fact that every game feels like a new experience. With this game...every playthough feels the same. The rooms will be rearranged, the weapons different, but nothing that makes you feel like the current playthrough is something special. I've played the game maybe 5 times, and beat it 3. Currently, there's nothing that makes me want to start another game, which I'm extremely disappointed about.",

            "review_text": "The game cought my eye when logging into Steam a number of weeks ago. It was thrown absentmindedly into my wishlist, not to be thought of again until a friend brought it up, and after inquiring as to what it was, bought it against my demands not to.   After plentiful chiding, I began to play the game I now remembered to find quite interesting.  It took practice and quite a bit of tweaking to figure out how to best play with the mouse, but I think by this I have it down moderately well.  The game quickly sucked me in with its plethora of weapons and items, some holding a very dear place in my heart for their preposterous ability to let you zip around the room, smashing into enemy after enemy, with a very satisfying effect. The cosmetic appeal encourages multiple runs for the sake of discovering new and powerful combos.  The only complaint I have to give at this point would be the unfinished feel of the game, as a whole. Hitboxes catch and glitch out, leaving your just-missed jump in the lurch as Heart drags against the edge of a platform. The lack of an anchored camera when you need it most can make what would be a simple jump into multiple attempts at sticking the landing, only to move on to yet another tricky leap.   The anchored camera, as I mentioned, would be an extremely helpful feature to see. Boss fights become awkward and messy when your camera is spinning to meet up with your mouse as you whip around a circular room to clobber B-DSS KNIGHT for the 20th time. Flybots nail you from behind because your attention is on a different enemy, and there's no visual warning for offscreen attacks.   The game has a long way to go before it can be seen as a well rounded and complete game. It focuses very heavily on the item and upgrade mechanics, but there's little meat to dialogue and it feels similar to a roulette rp in its substance, with uncomfortable pauses and very direct, bland statements.   While there isn't much to the game after you've run dry of new items to find, it certainly shows the potential for something great, maybe even a hidden gem. But it will take a lot of development yet to reach that goal.   Until then, it is my greatest hope that developers will continue to polish this game, build its story into something as memorable as its style, and make it something to be admired.   Recommended to those that enjoy games with a quick paced, multiple run slasher feel, good soundtracks, and fun character designs.",
