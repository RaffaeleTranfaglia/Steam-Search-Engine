            "review_text": "Elliot Quest is one of the best games I've played this year. Playing through it, you can tell that a lot of heart was put into making this game. The sense of exploration in Elliot Quest is far greater than any other game I've played recently. It keeps pulling you back to find out where else you can go and what else you can find now that you've gotten the next powerup. The art style is wonderful and unique, and the music and sound effects are great, too (there are also some well-placed Link to the Past references). The game does sometimes fault in not explaining enough of what is going on, but I feel this is better than erring on the side of explaining too much and ruining the chance for discovery and exploration.",

            "review_text": "Context: at time of review, 10 hours in. just at the 3rd dungeon. Spending most of my time trying to hunt down the various secrets/powerups I can get to w/ my current kit.  A Fun but Very Hard metroidvaina, which takes a lot of cues primarily from Zelda. LOTS of secrets &amp; powerups to hunt down, although most of the majority of them are just gold drops.   There is a leveling system, where ea. level you allocate a point to strength (range), wisdom (magic), vitality (health), agility (fire rate/move speed), or accuracy (random crit chance). Game works on a save point system, die or quit &amp; you restart at the last save point you touched. the Savepoints give you a base amount of hearts/mana... and the only drawback to dying is you lose current xp to next level. Developers obviously expected you to die somewhat frequently, and then retry ala platformers like VVVVVV.   There is also a morality system, based on a limited set of choices you make thru the game (save this kid, partner with this evil guy, do/don't rob this temple). It's pretty low key though; and you can pretty much ignore it for the most part.   The game is light on explaining its mechanics, while the basic function of most of the items is pretty straightforward, you'll need to experiment a bit to figure out everything they can do. That could be a plus or a minus, depending on your preference, if you hated Dark Souls cryptic item descriptions, you might hate Elliot Quest's lack of almost any direction too.  Graphics are obvious retro-pixely, but they're clean and attractive looking. Think classic NES style, but with more detail. Music is ok, but not spectacular and the 1st level is a very obvious rip off of a Zelda theme.  Bottom line, if you like metroidvanias and don't mind a bit of a challenge, give it a go.",

            "review_text": "Elliot Quest makes it no secret that it wants to be like a number of classic NES-era gems.   It accomplishes its goal extremely well.  I'm a big fan of the Metroidvania genre, and Elliot Quest delivers. Apart from discovering new areas to explore, it's deeply satifying to find alternate uses and effects for the items/spells you collect. Not just as a puzzle soliving element, but also the way certain spells will completely overpower certain enemy types (fire on a blue slime~).   Visually, it does a great job with pixel graphics. More specifically, it does a fantastic job with colors! The palette range is varied, giving each and every area a unique feel from the others. Off the top of my head, I can't think of any color that isn't used in full array.   This isn't to say it's without flaws - there's the occasional glitchy moment or questionable game design, and the story is so loosely presented that it feels like nothing more than a means to progress the action.   However, these errors are far and few between. At the time of writing, this game is an absolute steal at %50 off. Even at full price, it's more than worth it.   And in classic NES fashion. You might want to make notes and sketch out your own map~",

            "review_text": "The most important thing in my opinion is that this kind of games REQUIRES a good TRACKING SYSTEM, but Elliot has none, you just find something and then you feel like 'what to do now?' all the time, and I pesonally don't like games that needs google to find out what to do next, you need google even for the description of some basic items!   I really wanted to recommend this game and I really wanted to like it, but after finding out that you can miss some items and that there is a level cap after I spend my points (and you can't reset your points), it made me quit it.  Maybe I'll try it later, but I don't feel playing this game 3 full times just to get the 3 endings.  Elliot Quest is a superb game but it's lacking some basic features to make it really enjoyable.",
