            "review_text": "Ben and Dan are a pair of seasoned point-and-click adventurers who also happen to be your average British smartasses – though their jokes tend to be noticeably dumber (in a good way) and dirtier (again, in a good way). While trying to fix their TV in time for a relaxing episode of Magnum, P.I. they set off a chain of events which leads to the universe-hopping and time-jumping plots of Ben There, Dan That! and its sequel, Time Gentlemen, Please! The places and times they visit get sillier and sillier, but who really needs a deep plot when you've got good jokes?  Heavily influenced by classic point-and-click adventure games, both of the Ben and Dan games take their sense of humor and game feel from those old titles. Every line is a bad joke, an embarrassing pun, or an eye-rolling bit of meta-humor, and it's all a blast to read. The writing hits that perfect tone of 'smart in the dumbest way' and keeps the energy high with line after line of funny, stupid goodness. It's hard not to be impressed with the writers when the necessary evil of attempted item combinations yields lines that are just as funny as the main dialogue. There must be thousands of lines across both of these games, and I can't think of even one that I didn't enjoy. The art style works into this, too, with a rough look that is nevertheless very charming, colorful, and quite cohesive across every level.  Of course, while old adventure games were remembered for their writing and aesthetics, their gameplay isn't remembered quite so fondly. Unfortunately, Ben and Dan sometimes dive headfirst into those nasty pitfalls. For every few puzzles that goes along smoothly and logically, there will be a puzzle that will absolutely stump you, leading to far too much time mucking about in an overflowing inventory or with the finicky interface. The later puzzles of both games tend to throw logic out the window and require solutions that, while amusing once you know about them, are basically impossible to find without a walkthrough. Still, despite taking the bad with the good of the classic adventure genre, I'd say that the good is easily good enough to outweigh some awkwardness in design. Worthy new entries into a near-forgotten genre.",

They've both got the same awful (mostly on purpose) graphics, and annoying UI, but the writing was better in the first game. 'Time Gentlemen' had way more backtracking and the humour was less clever and more of the fart joke type of humour. Still, for the very, very cheap price I paid for this I can't complain. Definitely enjoyed 'Ben There, Dan That!' a lot more, although I can't say I recommend the games unless you can pick them up for roughly the ridiculous price I paid of 40c. Otherwise, there are better adventure games out there.",

Pros: Humor Cons: Graphics, Sound, Controls  These two low resolution protagonists, Ben and Dan, will somehow manage to save the world and be funny on their adventures, though not exactly in that order and probably not at the same time. It helps to have some experience with British humor and vocabulary (an aerial is an antenna, for example).  The graphics and sound are poor to say the least. Controls are no better; the majority of actions will be completed with the 'hand' yet it shares equal space with several less useful cursors. Of course, the difficulty is inflated in typical point-and-click fashion (thermos on lava, it all makes sense!).   With the number and availability of free and high quality point-and-click games nowadays, these two have difficulty standing out.  4/10",

Maybe modern times made me lazy, but I recall that I didn't like this control scheme on the old Sierra games back in the day either which is why I barely finished any of them. I have the same issue with these games and not finishing them either. A verb menu or context-sensitive cursors would've helped alot here. On the upside, these kind of controls allow for some funny additional dialogue and obscure attempts that are absent in most modern games.  If you can look past the controls (I can't), you will find a strange and funny game that you might enjoy - and it's plenty 'o cheap to buy too!",

            "review_text": "Well, I can officially say that I've used Hitler's bloody feces as an intergral tool in a video game. So there's that.  Time Gentlemen, Please is the sort of point-and-click adventure throwback that gives you a bunch of ridiculous items and asks you to find practical uses for them. Unlike a lot of the classics I thought the solutions to puzzles were genuinely clear and the few times I got stuck I felt like it was my own fault for not trying something obvious. There are enough puzzles that need you to find out a specific way to use an item rather that just using it in the right spot so it doesn't feel like a case of just using everything on eveything else until you stumble on the solution. On the whole it's on the easier side as far as these games go.  The writing in the game is more the star of the game than anything else. It's a pleasant change of pace if you get sick of adventure games that simply repeat 'I can't do that' for everything that isn't solution related. Attempting to combine most items or use them with most things in the world will give you unique dialogues for each action. Often with little hints towards solutions hidden in them. The humor alternates between referencing classic adventure games and toilet humor. At first it's pretty funny to examine random items and get rewarded with ♥♥♥♥-jokes, but it wears a little thin by the end and if you're new to adventure games all the references will probably fly over your head. It's definitely has an intended audience that will find it hilarious and the rest will probably scratch their heads. Overall I thought the jokes and one-liners were funny way more often than not, just by the sheer volume of them it's a little tiring by the end.  Also I'm not a fan of having to click through the different look/talk/use/move options, I'd rather be able to select the one I want, but it's not horrible by adventure game standards, just frustrating after a while.  Ben There, Dan That is also included in the package. It was a freebie game that was the blueprint for Time Gentlemen, Please. It's much shorter, but it still has the same mechanics and clever writing. The puzzles are pretty one-dimensional though though.",

The first, 'Ben There, Dan That' is not great, suffering from a lot of linearity, but it was still fun enough to play through, and definitely worth playing as a preface to 'Time Gentlemen, Please'. This one had more polished writing, better puzzles, and felt more open than the predecessor. After the opening stages of the game, there are a lot of paths of exploration and puzzles available to be solved. I did get stuck a few times, but on all but one of them I was able to figure out the solution after taking a break from the game. One puzzle I did have to look up a walkthrough for, but it was only because what I thought was one game-object was actually two, and I needed to click on the 'second' one.  On the whole these were fun for me to play through, with many good puzzles and few bad ones.  Two things that may impact your enjoyment of the game. The humour is quite crude. If that's not your bag, then I think you'll find the writing grating. It's also quite a self-aware and self-referential game, which some people can't stand.",

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",
