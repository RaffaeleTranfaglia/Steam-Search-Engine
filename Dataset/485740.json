You need to put in a line (horizontal or vertical) 4 blocks of the same color in order to make them disappear to get points and level up. When you level up you also get some special one use 'powers' to help you out.  Right now, there are 4 game modes so the game wont get monotone *blink blink* (pun intended :D) and you can kill boredom every time you need.  In summary, I highly recommend this game as a idle time killer.",
