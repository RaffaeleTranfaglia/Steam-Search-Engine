            "review_text": "Shoggoth's Scenic Driving Tour of England   Reviewer's Note: Over 50 Hours with Humble Bundle Copy   'It's late. At least, I think it's late. Keeping track of time isn't a priority - wherever I am now... like a purple nimbus cloud crackling with electricity. What's important is that I've saved the world, and no one will be any the wiser.  …  'Not that I did this for recognition, no! I'm not vainglorious or anything. This was all honestly just a happy byproduct of my pursuit of arcane knowledge, of the Eldritch Truth. I was laughed out of the academy, and the very men and women who found my research so amusing now owe me their insignificant lives. If they had seen what I've seen, fought what I've fought, learned what I've learned, they'd still be laughing - restrained in padded cells, or worse.  'Now to busy myself for eternity, and let's hope it's a brisk one because I'm quickly running out of reading material.'   The Consuming Shadow is great fun. It isn't the deepest or most challenging procedural-type game I've ever played, but it is one of the most unique... like if FTL and Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem finally hooked up and made an unholy union. You play as a nameless, silhouette-y scholar tasked with stopping an ancient alien god's invasion of England (in 60 hours no less) because, let's face it, anything fantastical or magical or evil is innately going to be drawn to England for its rich history, world-renowned cuisine, and year-round pleasant weather.  And it goes without saying you'll have to remain sane, tricky business considering the position you're in.  Sat in your car with a helpful sticky note attached to the rearview mirror (“Don't look back,” Yahtzee's nod to Daenerys Targaryen, one assumes), you must work your way southward towards Stonehenge (the aforementioned ancient god couldn't be ♥♥♥♥♥ to research a less obvious pagan site), stopping at all the quaint villages peppering the English countryside to take on jobs from the Ministry of Occultism, resupply, and generally pop in to make sure all the villagers haven't been replaced with horrible squid monsters and telemarketers.   That's the real pulsating meat of the game – you'll select a destination, drive a ways and encounter a particularly foggy town. Flavor text will inform you that everything isn't as it seems in Lil' Silent Hill, and you'll have to contend with a series of random dungeon scenarios – a hostage situation, sealing a rift, clearing an infestation... run of the mill English stuff, presumably. The dungeons are laid out in a random grid that you traverse like the 2D side-scrollin' badass you are.  Depending on what kind of a dungeon you find yourself in (there's quite a few), you'll get ammo, health, spells, sundry helpful items, and clues to suss out just what kind of an ancient alien god you're dealing with. Of course, you can't enjoy all that ammo, health, spells and so on without killing all the creeping, crawling, and flying horrors occupying the dungeon. The combat is, for me anyway, akin to combat in Silent Hill 2. Your firearm autoaims, and mele is an incredibly viable (read: powerful) option, but you're going to take hits and the combat isn't going to feel amazing... just acceptable. Which is fine! Again, Silent Hill 2-y. I feel like a Joe Shmo fighting unspeakable horror, and I shouldn't feel like his loud cousin Joey Kickass, frequent ruiner of children parties. And if you take too much damage, or dabble too often in the sexy dark arts, you'll encounter some clever little status and sanity effects... nothing quite as memorable as, say Eternal Darkness', but much more impactful on gameplay.  I mentioned that there are clues... see, part of the “stopping an ancient alien god's invasion” is knowing the proper incantation, which you aren't going to just know off the top of your head. Instead, you'll find helpful cultists have left various notes throughout dungeons providing contextual clues like, “the blue god is associated with raucous partying,” “Bytalia hates the ever-loving ♥♥♥♥ out of the god associated with the SMH rune,” and so on. Armed with a handy table, you can fill in pertinent information as you find it. This minor aspect of the game is what I found most fun, oddly enough. It felt like I was playing a boardgame. Once you have (or think you have) enough information you can brave Stonehenge itself for either a thrilling conclusion, a hilariously colossal cockup, or something in between.  With each subsequent playthrough you'll unlock new characters (three, each with a slightly different gameplay focus), constellations that let you focus on stats or abilities, and of course flavor text lore in the forms of a diary and bestiary.  The Consuming Shadow is going to have some complaints, and I'm sure a point of contention for some people will be the general aesthetic. While I initially found it less than easy on the eyes, The Consuming Shadow grew on me. There's something absolutely charming about it, I can't quite explain it. I felt immersed, like I was sitting in MY car, checking off a list, sleepily driving towards another cursed township (the otherworldly soundtrack helps a bunch in the ambiance department). My biggest qualm is that I wish there was MORE, which is asking a lot of a sole developer, I know. It's just that after a few playthroughs you'll encounter the same scenarios, same dungeons, same spook text messages, and same sanity effects. I would have loved more flavor text, more horrors, and while I thoroughly enjoyed the English setting I would have really liked some other maps... Australia perhaps, with the ancient god heading towards Uluru, or maybe the ancient god is in the continental United States in search of the first McDonald's.  But I digress. The Consuming Shadow is, as I said, great fun. It's cosmic horror-themed FTL when boiled down to its most basic concept, only instead of being chased by an ironically xenophobic intergalactic rebel fleet you're fleeing from pure, unadulterated EVIL™. The controls are tight and intuitive, the sound design is atmospheric, and... I don't know, it just feels good to play. Yahtzee took a bunch of great retro game mechanics and sensibilities and arranged them in such a way that it doesn't feel like another forced retro indie title.  This is one immersive, engaging, and well-written title. It's fulfilling to flesh out your diary and bestiary, it's thrilling when you finally win (and when you “win”), and it honestly makes for a fun little party game. My friends and I sat around for hours exploring dungeons, filling out the table, and dying.  We died a lot.  And you will too.   I've seen it in the stars.  INSANITY EDIT: the Steam edition includes lots of challenges to keep you coming back for more, PLUS I've noticed a few new denizens occupying the dungeons... definitely a fan of the creepy skitterish guy with more head than can be reasonably explained by natural selection.",

            "review_text": "The Consuming Shadow is an excelent mix of horror with retro gameplay. Simple at a glance but surprisingly deep you'll find yourself zipping around a randomly generated British countryside slaying demons and helping wayward souls in your mission to discover the dark god invading the world and the ritual required to banish it.  I could most easily compare the basics of dark-god banishment as a sort of game of Clue, for those who remember the boardgame pasttime, a deductive reasoning experience where you strive to find clues infering what gods are present and what symbols they use with the goal of figuring out which god is invading and what rune holds its affinity. Combing the god's rune with a discovered ritual will allow you to make an attempt at saving the world in Stonehunge, if you can survive long enough to get there.  Combat is hectic and claustrophobic as you battle quick, silhouetted beasties with limited light, pistol-whipping and firing wild shots in oppressively poorly lit dungeons. Choosing the right tactic, ammo and timing are all important.  Magic plays a role as well as you must utilize a collection of runes to both banish dark gods as well as cast spells you may find in your searches, counterspell evil cultists to defeat their magical barriers or to close rifts allowing shadowy creatures into the living world.  Resource management, time management, trigger discipline, reasoning skills and a bit of a gambling nature all play their part in the game. Do you want a few extra hollow point bullets, or the useful piece of gear? Wlil you gamble on your intuition to keep you from wasting ammo on hallucinations as your sanity wanes, or shoot up with illicit narcotics to keep your calm? Should you try and stop the crazed gunman with your words or your hands?  New to the Steam edition are a number of challenge modes including a daily challenge with randomized modifiers, achievements and trading cards. There are several unlockable characters with differeing capabilities and a somewhat gentle progression system that optionally allows you to get a little bit better with each run if you so choose by spending 'birth stars' on a series of randomized stat boosts.  The Consuming Shadows won't be for everyone. Watch some videos and decide for yourself, what you see is what you get. It'll either be amazingly cool or completely out of your range of interests. And don't mind my playtime, I put quite a lot of time into it when it came out in the Humble Store. It will likely grow in time.",

            "review_text": "Fun fun fun. Is the game worth playing? Yes Is it worth 10 bucks? Ehhhhhhh... That'll be up to you, of course.  It's a very well written and designed game. Not scary, nor particularly distrubing, but it is very very creepy. The art direction, although very simple, is also perfectly fitting. Even the text assets are acceptable despite being default plaintext, seeing as the character is either typing it out or reading it on typed paper.  The gameplay is uniqe, as far as I know. You simply walk left and right through procedurally generated dungeons and events, shooting, bashing, looting, running, and incanting your way past your foes. You have both health and sanity to monitor, of course. What makes it fun is whodunit take on figuring out which evil entity to banish, piece by piece assembling the know how to save the world. The fittingly abiguious yet descriptive writting also helps. Yes I know that's oxymoronic, but it just works.   The challenge is tight. At first I was sceptical of the difficulty. Then I realized you drain your health kit like a bullet hole riddled tub drains water. Then I couldn't find a way to permenantly restore sanity. Then I had broken legs, a panic attack, an was gushing blood, and proceded to clear three more towns that way before dying. ♥♥♥♥ was tense.  Replayability also seems very high, which is good for a session based game like this. If you've played FTL, you'd probably find Consuming Shadow's game sessions similar in length. Besides the main gameplay supported story and unlocks, you also have a daily challenge generator, and an endless dungeon mode. The list of individual challenges you can also unlock is short, but the game makes up for it in other unlockables. It has a diary you can rebuild, page by page. It also has a typical 'bestiary', but one that unlocks word by word, creating a more rewarding 'bestiary' to fill than most every other game has.  In conclusion, sure, the game has problems. The obvious 'how did they miss that' graphical bug, the graphics that obviously auto-scale for bigger monitors, and keys can't be rebound in the options. These little problems pale in comparison to everything it does right. Overall, I'd ask you to overlook the rough edges and buy this game if it interested you in any way.",

            "review_text": "I've been playing this game for much longer than 8 minutes, I played primarily on the version from the Humble Store. This steam key was also included if the game got greenlit, so I put in just a few minutes to share my thoughts.  When someone says that RNG can't make an experience that draws desperation and fear, be satisfying and  not  devolve into a frustrating pile of dogshit, this is the game that I will show them.  Yahtzee Croshaw is a well known critic of games and game design, and it seems he with this game, he shows that he can put his money where his mouth is.The game is incredibly well balanced, with every playable character having a different playstyle that will draw you into the world. Embark on an adventure, where ammo is scarce and every single item and clue is tantamount to preserving your life for that one last moment. The pool of dialogue and actions are somewhat scarce, but the ability to which they are done is profound. It's amazing that this game, with all of its well crafted design (bar the aesthetics that do the job but could be better), is a simple logic puzzle at its core.  This game, despite its harshness, is fun. It's scary. It fills me with desperation knowing that it is up to me to help this man save the world before the toll on his mind breaks him, provided the monsters don't break his body first.  Everything has a lovecraftean vibe that only adds to the tension. I am filled with dread once I complete a mission, scared that a powerful monster will spawn in moments, where I begin to freak out and attempt to escape before the giant face that consumes the room will eat me as well.  The game makes the smart move of balancing everything, so that the penalties have a large effect on the game but do not simply cause them to kill you without warning. Every option has something that can help the situation and even then it still can dangle hope within your grasp, as you agonize over whether or not you should save a boy from a burning car.  This game has many random elements, but have been able to apply balance and design in a way that makes the things keeping RNG in check in a meaningful and useful way, without removing the emotions the game wishes to elicit in all of its scenarios. I feel bad when I lose, I am relieved when I win. I don't feel frustrated by the game's systems, because my actions are that;  my  actions. I am responsible for taking care of my character and it will be my choice that leads him to saving the world or shooting himself in the head.",

At the end of the day it's a nice game to kill some time, the game functions perfectly well and rarely feels flatout unfair, the addition of challenges extends the play time quite a lot and if you get into it you'll find it rather easy to get your money's worth.",

            "review_text": "While I'm not a fan of the auto-aim system, where you're trying to hit the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ghost trying to kill you and instead you swat a fly, I'm really in love with this game. Graphics are 'mediocre', but very atmospheric. Writing's amazing. Music's beautiful, even if it starts to get a bit samey over time. The game's easy when you know what you're doing (banishing the big bad with over 20 hours to spare isn't hard if the RNG isn't actively hating you), but Challenge Mode will make sure you NEVER know what you're doing, which is perfect for players wanting a challenge. The research 'minigame' is at times brainracking, and always very fun. That moment between casting the banishment ritual using the clues you'd gathered and the boss fight (or the lack thereof) is always incredibly tense, and it's euphoric being proven right (though this lessens with each playthrough). Sadly, none of the challenges do anything to try to make this aspect of the game harder - I'd love a mode where I had to decipher who the baddie was with the knowledge that there were FOUR gods in this fustercluck. The game REALLY comes alive when you're close to losing (though this is true of everything, I think). When you're low on health and running away from a hunter, when you've got two minutes on the clock, are in stonehenge and have only half a banishment ritual, etc. One extremely minor quibble I have (disregarding the first one) is that you can't just skip the astrology section once you've got birth stars. You HAVE to look for an empty space and choose it if you don't want any bonuses ruining your playthrough. If I might suggest extra features, perhaps a hard mode where each astrology bonus comes with a penalty as well, or something - like, if you want +25 health, you have to take -25 sanity, or raising your medkit capacity means lowering your ammo-count, or something randomized.  If you want the game insultingly easy, and you've got some birth stars to spare, GET EXTRA AMMUNITION. Health and sanity are all well and good, but if you've got a tonne of ammo, you won't need to take hits to health or sanity at all. Once you maximize ammo capacity, you really only have to worry about your route and the clues - the game's extremely liberal with handing out ammo.  Alternatively, increase Melee and keep ammo for bosses. (Almost) Every single minor enemy can easily be beaten through pistol-whipping, so just keep doing that and learn each enemy's pattern.",

This game is heavily entrenched in lovecraftian lore and like many of the most famous lovecraftian games, features a sort of detective element as the user (who plays as one of four characters with varying abilities for slightly different playstyles) must discover clues as to what the banishment ritual is to stop the invading god and who the invading god actually is.  It is this detective element that is one of my favourite parts of the game as using all the clues to work out the three gods and their varing details makes for its own subgame that keeps you going throughout.  The main gameplay is the dungeons which you are in so often that you would not be initially forgiven for thinking these would get repetetive but the constant threat of death or insanity, using the gameplay shifting and excellently implemented insanity mechanic, keeps the stakes up and stops any dungeon sequence from being boring.  As previously mentioned there is an insanity mechanic and unlike in other games where the changes are superficial and tend to encourage insanity accidently due to the interesting changes in this game you fear insanity and being insane actually really increases the difficulty forcing you to put insanity as a priority over health as health can be more easily recovered.  Lastly you will die in this game and as the game will tell you death is neccesary to get progression through the birthstar system to give you bonuses and as the story follows the multiverse theory all playthroughs are canon and there are even hints to the creators own Chzo mythos.  Overall I must give it an 8/10 as for all the good things stated above there is a genuine problem of balance as the game is cruel and there are a few times that I looked at the game and got frustrated at the detective elements but they are almost always the fualt of the player but there are a few things that the creator could improve like the in car UI and better graphics would certainly appease some of the knats if not improve the game.",
