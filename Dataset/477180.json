    "description": "Shard Games is a competitive sports game similar to real Olympics on Earth. However, there is one tiny, little difference: it’s fatal. To survive and win, sportsmen and sportswomen, you’ll have to kill each other in a variety of ways but mainly with explosives! What’s more spectacular than a nice explosion?",
