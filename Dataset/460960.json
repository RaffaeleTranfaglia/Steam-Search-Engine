            "review_text": "If you liked the first game and want more of the same, this one is worth grabbing on the cheap. Its not bad, its just that it could have been better. For the price you are getting your money's worth at least.   The games biggest strength is that it gives you more of what made the first game interesting. Its biggest weakness is it adds nothing new while wearing out the formula, making it somewhat of a dissapointment. And it follows that formula   exactly to the letter   for all 3 scenarios. Gather incriminating evidense and weapon, dinner, then plant the evidense and commit the deed.  This would really have worked out better if expanded on instead of just being rehashed. Ironicly the first game feels like it has more depth than this 3 scenario sequal - you'd think we're getting 3x as much game but it doesn't feel like as much time was spent on this.  If a 3rd game gets made, I hope the developers don't just reuse the same template again. reverse clue is really fun and if it can be made to not be so repetitive it'll have a lot of reply value, which is where both games fall short right now.",

Now, let's multiply that game by 3! There's 3 storylines in this game! 3 Times what the original game had. Pretty awesome. Great storyline. Easy achievements once again. Recommended for sure! :D",

            "review_text": "A generally great follow up to the original Deed. The 3 new scenarios have excellent variety in terms of settings and characters and allow for interesting creativity for how you go about trying to pull off the crime and get away with it. I also liked how the last scenario here ties things together with the first game, appropriately in a bittersweet way.   However, as much as I appreciate having more scenarios included, the original game had only one, and the dialogue choices here pose a bit more of a challenge, at least initially, I miss some of the odd humor that could found in the first Deed. More often than not these choices would very much derail your attempt to commit a perfect murder, but I also believe added to the replay value. There was entertainment, even if your character is doing everything spectacularly wrong.  In any case, I still strongly recommend The Deed: Dynasty. The developer is excellent and delivers great value for a very fair price. I look forward to playing more Pilgrim Adventures in the future and hope that at some point they revisit The Deed concept again.",

            "review_text": "This is NOT AS GOOD as the original Deed game imho. The original had a more convincing storyline and had more atmospheric horror than all three stories given by this sequal 'Deed Dynasty'.   Pros: * 3 Stories rather than 1. Much more playability * You get more dialogue choices in this new game than the original (not sure if quantity&gt;quality though) * 3 Different time eras made the murders rather interesting. Can't wait for a '21st century Deed'  Cons: * Why remove the scary 'red' scenes the original had? They gave atmosphere to the game * All 3 stories seems rushed and lacking quality compared to the original * Still lacking graphics of the actual murder (screen just goes black) * Still using RPG maker engine",
