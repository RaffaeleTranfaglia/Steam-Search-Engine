            "review_text": "Recommended, but this game needs a lot of work. Most of the time I was just wandering around farming Slendy, the Grim Reaper, and Camel-headed Slendy while completely lost. The game has a decent environment; I like the shape of the trees, the helpful glow of throwable items, and the variety of items. But getting to the items (via mouse scroll) is almost impossible, making you overshoot the item you need.   Once you get going, you don't die (hint: aim the HUD at the heal kits in the vending machines to heal), at least not easily, and I quit out of frustration and being lost rather than fear or death. Life and Stamina meters are a godsend - thank you! The on-board compass and ingame 'maps' (map? it's literally just a field with 'you are here' on it :T ) are nice, but give us a little bit more. I'd like to know that walking in one direction forever will eventually get me somewhere.  Devs, please - put more than one sound on the footsteps. That sickening grass/gravel crunch turns my stomach. The ambient noises are really good, though - that howling/screaming one was just creepy! An overall story would be GOLDEN. You have a lot of room for great parody, here. USE IT!  I do not believe the church exists. There are signs for it, but I've never seen it. :T  Calm down that mouse sensitivity as well. It's bad. I waste more potatoes shooting trees than creeps. But I love the ragdoll physics used (the truck tire is certainly worth using!), and dropping Slendy &amp; friends is quite satisfying.  GUYS - THIS GAME IS SCARIER THAN IT LETS ON. I was walking after getting the second page and out of nowhere some gray body/face/screaming thing popped on screen in line with my HUD. Made me jump a damn mile! Jump scares are all right, but the scary noises and ambience is even better.  Good cheap game, nice if you're too freaked by Slender. Worth the $0.99 I put into it, but with some work it could be worth a lot more. Definitely has potential.",

But I would totaly buy this for all my friends so they are sad.",

            "review_text": "My first horror/adventure was penumbra and needless to say, (but will any way), I was hooked to the genre. When I first played slender man with my sister we had a fairly good time. This game doesn't even come close to the standards set forth by the penumbra series or even by ,the less creative but still OK ,slender man game. My main complaint concering the graphics was the setting which was suppose to be this scary forest. Well it wasn't scary and what's more it barely passed as a forest. It revealed to me how unimaginative the developer(s) are as well as their knowledge or lack of what makes a successful horror/adventure game. Another complaint I have is the game's lack of originality in other words it has been done there is no need to create the same game over and over again. My advice is to be inspired by other games not copy them, you know take what has been done and go to the next level ,think outside the box, do what hasn't been done yet.",
