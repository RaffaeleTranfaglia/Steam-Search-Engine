Pros: * Given away on some free giveaways, so keep an eye out for that. * Simplistic graphics, can be run on anything. * Cow corpses stay there until the end of the mission. (Trust me, it's quite good) * 4 of the 5 achievements can be obtained in the first 30-45 minutes. * No need to focus on the game. * Skills and upgrades.  Neutral: * Hard to tell the live cows from the dead ones later on... (Technically realism?).  Cons: * Last achievement can be obtained in the end of the game, probably about 6-8 hours in the game. * The difficulty curve is just too harsh. * The hitboxes are a bit screwy, I'd suggest shooting slightly above the cow to hit.   Overall: 5/10 (Barely recommended) If I had to pay for this, it'd be 3.5/10",

The game is fairly easy and progresses quickly as more difficult opponents are put against you. However things get boring quickly as you will be doing the same thing over and over again: surviving waves of opponents thrown at you. This would have been a fairly enjoyable experience if it not were for the non reconfigurable qwerty keyboard controls. On an azerty keyboard this adds a lot of complexity and frustration.

The upgrades aren't really original same as abilities but still has some potential... if the devs decide to carry the game on.  Pros  - Pretty stupid, the story and the overall design. - Horribly voice acted, which I think is a good thing. - It's fun, as a 5 minute timewaster and nothing more. Expect this to be played for at most 3 hours and then left in your steam library and with the cobwebs growing...  Cons  - Fairly limited gameplay, gets repetitive. - Not completely original, the upgrades, the style of side scrolling defense and the overall feel, makes me wish this was free as a flash game. - Not entirely worth $13 USD, but if you have some money lying around when this is on sale. $3.79 (75% off) is quite the interesting deal.",

ProTip: When starting a level instantly buy your upgrades and try to get a 3$ bonus from the Care Package. Try to go with 1 level in your Z, 2 in your X, 1 in your C and finally get buckshots. Keep restarting until you get a +3$ and you're on for an easy game. Try focusing your earning on the X and Z first.",

Honestly this game feels like it would be at home on Newgrounds.  As I type this Culling of the Cows is $1.29 USD which is about the right price to pick it up at as the normal price of 12.99 is way to much for what you get. If you must pick it up do it on sale.",

I’m not sure exactly what the genre would be called; you are an old farmer with a shot gun taking out mutant/zombie cows before they can reach the barn behind you. It’s the kind of goofy flash game you would see on Newgrounds back in the day, but not one you would ever be expected to pay for. The movement is a little stiff and the shots don’t actually seem to register correctly about 1/3 of the time, which is exacerbated by the flat south park-esque characters giving you no good indication of depth down range. I played it for around 20 or 30 minutes and was quite bored, then booted it back up when I noticed an announcement on the Library page: Cheat Codes Added. Generally cheat codes end up ruining the fun of a game, but in a game like this maybe skipping to the excitement would keep me engaged for at least a while longer. I activated God Mode, unlocked all the upgrades, and added an MG nest to the top of the barn; awesome right? Except it wasn’t. There wasn’t any big spectacle, the MG was anemic at best, and God Mode only lasted roughly 15 seconds.  I don’t know if I’m missing something or if there are some shady things going on because the overall consensus is Very Positive at the time of writing this. I got this as a free key from some bundle website a while back and I almost regret having it in my library. It functions enough to be acceptable on a flash game website but I’ll be hiding it in my Steam library and never touching it again.",

Plus, you have to press R for reloading every single bullet and it will made your index finger tired between moving to D and rapidly pressing R after a while (if it can change to Space button would be nice, but dev gave a middlepinger right in our face).  - Until now, I still don't now what Z,X and C upgrade for (all I now is V get you laser for better aim)? No intruction as far as I remember, too (or I've skipped it, I means ain't nobody got time for that). Hover your mouse on it to show what it do is a basic thing that all game need.   - Talks about mouse, because you aim by moving, so dev should make it keybroad only (for laptop users), or you know, a ♥♥♥♥ING config control option. By made this keyboard and mouse, your left hand have to handle so much things (moving, reloading every ♥♥♥♥ing single bullet, upgrade, call supply, change bullet type) while all your right hand do is right click to shoot (left click to alt-fire but you can only do it when using first type of bullet, and you move so slow which means you gonna stick near your base, far from those cow, which means it's useless for 99% of the time).  ==&gt; Conclusion: There are better flash games out there and they're free. Don't buy this game even 90% off, wait and find free key online. Only buy as gift to ♥♥♥♥ off your Curry friends (which I wouldn't recommend, too).",

Controls are rubbish, they cannot be changed.  Item upgrades have no description anywhere, so you just have to guess.  The hit detection is worse than the Holocaust.  You can have power-ups or credits dropped from the sky but, again, nobody tells you that this function exists, or what each one does.  There are cheat codes but they must be entered while you're fighting. You die before you can finish typing.  The content is tiny, very badly done.  The voice acting is one of the worst I've ever seen. And I'm not comparing it to AAA games. No. I mean this is terrible, beyond comparison. If a deaf person heard this game after getting their hearing back, they'd kill the surgeon.  The music lasts 20 seconds and loops infintely, burning your brains out.  There are only 5 achievements and they only require you to press a button. Stupider than Jayden Smith.  It is a very poor copy of Plants vs Zombies, where you have to protect your farm (instead of house) from zombie cows AND normal zombies. But instead of having a strategy you have to remember what 12 different keys do, but also pay attention to how much money you have, otherwise you cannot press them. Plus, some have cooldowns! All of this while you're moving around the map with WASD.  Oh, by the way, you have to reload constantly, but reloading takes LONGER than enemies to kill you. And this is not explained anywhere, either.  It seems it's going to be a joke about rednecks, but it feels like it was made by rednecks instead.  It's not even bloody enough. It feels worse than those flash games from 1997 which took 10 hours to load and then had less features than Pong. Worse than those PowerPoint chain emails they send you, which after 10 minutes of loading and scrolling through endless mail addresses, are not even funny.  At first I thought I should be supportive of an indie game. Maybe they haven't got a clue how to make a game, or they just don't have the team. But I've seen Audiosurf come out of ONE person's work. And it's brilliant. You can't get more indie than Grezzo 2, and it's hilarious. If you want badly-done-on-purpose, there is Goat Simulator. Even Garry's Mod. This is just vomitive. Especially when you consider it's 9 pounds. 9 POUNDS! Which is around 13-15 dollars. For this!!  And no. I don't write reviews lightly. I usually play for at least 20 hours before thinking I can give my opinion (feel free to check my other reviews). But honestly, after 5 minutes, there is nothing else to be seen.  I just spent the following 40 minutes trying to get the last achievement.  I'm really sorry, but for the first time ever, I'm going to award a game a negative score. -1/10 Run. Far.",

At first I liked the music - A bit 16bit'ish with some nice distortion. It quickly irked me once I realised the distorted sounds where allover the place. And once you get further into the game, the charm of the sad and ugly graphics quickly turns for the worse. The more enemies you kill, the more garbage fills your screen. No explanation of the different ammo types or upgrades, and the stupid assist constantly changes slots. Also, it never mentions that your own 'assist' can kill you &gt;.&lt;  At least you're able to mute the game, make it windowed and idle while doing other stuff (= getting the 5 free cards).  If you got this game as I did (i.e: No refund option) and you want the stupid free cards (and easy 100% achievement) follow the neat guides. One, by the developer, tells you how to open the cheat menu (I could NOT figure out how to do it) but also list all the cheats. One opens up all the worlds - BOOM. Go to last level, use the guide which tells you how to skip the first two sectors and BOOM! Achievement done in less hours than I have spent.  *sigh* I can't believe it took me 3hours of grinding before I finally 'cheated' and went looking at the guides. Save yourselves some time, and just blatantly 'cheat' through the achievements.  Very bad game. Very bad price tag. I sincerly hope you didn't buy this game by your own choice.
