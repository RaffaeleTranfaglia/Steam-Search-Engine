            "review_text": "  A great couch game that delivers a lot of fun when played together with friends. It's plain and simple fighting but what makes it fun is that it's based solely on the skills of the player. There is no RNG to blame for bad luck (unless the fight goes on too long).  It's become more and more balanced with each update. There are no OP weapons that would work in every situation. You have to choose between ranged and melee depending on the situation. There's plenty of different levels and the variation in their layouts is good. The slowmo kills are awesome :) .  There's not a lot of cons now that the game's been refined through updates. Could maybe use some more content like differently themed levels and some additional music but there's nothing to complain about the gameplay itself.",
