            "review_text": "Allods Online was one of my favorite free to play MMO's out there, and while I cannot read Russian well I remember enough of the game to get by. Allods Online is one of those games that starts out great and slowly and, seemingly inevitably falls pay to win. As much as the peak time for playing Allods has passed, lower pop, more pay to win days ahead you can still find fun in Allods. The style is something I don't feel anyone has really replicated well, one of the more unique free to play MMO's from around 2010.   In Allods you start by picking your race, the two factions each have three races. The races of the Empire are Orcs, Xadaganians (Empire Humans), and the Arisen (aka Russian Necrons). The races of the League are the Elves, the Kanians (League Humans), and the Gibberlings. These Gibberlings need a bit of an explanation. You see the Gibberlings are one of the most unique races I have seen playable in an mmo because you play three of them, at once all animated together! Gibberlings are pretty much tiny 2 foot tall badger people, they fight and live in groups of three, so for every action they work together to accomplish they each have there own role to play. As an example if you chose a sword and shield class chances are your Gibberlings will have be carrying a sword, one with a shield and one running around doing anything else!. Don't worry though, Gibberlings are not 'micro' heavy, its only the animations that are fun and exotic, otherwise they play like any other character.   The classes of Allods Online are broken down into archetypes, each archetype reflecting a slightly different class per race. the archetypes are Warrior, Paladin, Scout, Healer, Warden, Mage, Summoner, Psionicist. Not every race can play every archetype.    A bit of background lore now, in Allods an a time long past there was a terrible cataclysm that sundered the worlds into islands and nations that float through the 'Astral'. The Astral functions like a primitives idea of space, filled with energy that you can traverse with Astral ships, sailing from one world or island to the next. This is one of the more attractive features of Allods Online, and while I wont go into it heavily here, it has much bearing on end game. You will learn more about Astral and the history of the world if you play Allods.     Overall I have to say I really do enjoy Allods even if it is pay to win now in 2016. I hope at some time in the future we get the english version of the game available on Steam!",
