For the passage of the game you will see a short cartoon. If you have a problem or question - just ask at steam forum and get fast answer.  GJ, APS.",

Based on the Countryball comic web series this game follows Polandball, a hard done by Countryball, picked on and bullied by the other Countryballs. To show the other balls who's boss, he decides to build himself a spaceship to make it to the moon!  Upgrade your ship for stability, power and to resist damage. Collect money and fuel as you fly through the sky to show those other balls who's got the biggest...ego.  A big game for a small price.",

On the other hand, the upgrade system is awkward, progression is slow and linear, and nothing says professional quite like a Unity Personal splash screen.  It's $3 and it's Polandball*. Go for it.  *I'm not sure who, if anyone, owns the rights to this, so if you want this game I'd get it while you still can.",

Seriously, ♥♥♥♥ Belgium, they can peddle on their little bike over to me to suck my ♥♥♥♥, but they'll have to wait in line behind Romania, Scotland and Serbia.  The game itself is quite fun.",
