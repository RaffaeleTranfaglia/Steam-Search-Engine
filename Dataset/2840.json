    "description": "The Human Race had advanced to the point where we could travel among the stars, we developed giant automated machines to help us colonise other worlds, but there was a fault in their programming and they turned and attacked. Forcing us to lay a trap to protect Earth and exiling the Human race to stay on Earth once again.",

            "review_text": "This game is exactly like the Elite game: Frontier - Elite II. But more better and simplier. The only thing is if you got games like X2 and X3 then you may not adapt to the controls and how to manage those open-ended games. Start with this game and try it! If you get stuck or think you need more cash in-game, look into the Egosoft site. And use the HEX editor tool in your x-btf saves. Read more info in Egosoft or the Cheat sites.  The only thing that this game got, compared to the newer X-Series games is the afterburner turbo boost and the SETA Boost Extension that isn't featured in the newer series. I have to warn you if you play X2 The Threat onwards you maybe lost on how to interact, trade and fight -- as it is a steep learning curve. So start with X - Beyond the Frontier and maybe have a glance on my guides and video tutorials if you are interested.",

            "review_text": "Pretty good space trading game, not complicated at all and easy to get in to. I am enjoying it so far. Hopefully the rest of the series will be as appealing to me. It's worth trying if you like space trading games, and the X super box ever goes on sale or is bundled again.  Tip: there is a brief text file in the game directory you should look at first before starting. It will tell you exactly what you need to do to get going. e.g trade solar cells and buy a SETA so you can move fast right away. If you don't know that you may spoend more than 15 minutes moving at a snails pace and that wouldn't be fun. Definitely do 1 trade, then next immediately grab a SETA and keep going from there.",

Even playing with a joystick is a nightmare because the directions of the joystick are mapped to the keys of the keyboard. I feel sad that I'm missing on the story but I can't play that game in this state.",

            "review_text": "I played through this game just for the story so I could move on to the better-looking (and hopefully better all-around) sequals in the X series. I'd like to say I put about 40 hours into this game, 40 hours that I will never get back. The only other open-world space sim I've played was Freelancer back in high school and that game was a hundred times better than X: Beyond the Frontier. Let me tell you exactly what this game has in store for gamers:  Start off with almost nothing with no instructions on what to do next. Search the internet for guides and find only a couple. Fly back and forth between space stations buying x number of items to sell to another station for x amount of credits. Repeat this process about 200 times until you can eventually buy whatever stations you want to take the stupid dock-and-trade chore out of the game while they make money for you. Once you've gotten to this point in the game prepare to be further dissapointed. The rest of the game consists of flying back and forth across the universe for hours, finding specific objects and only once in a while participating in some very bland, uninspiring, and unrewarding dogfights against the simplest and easiest AI.  I know this game came out in 1999 but it's seriously bad. I wish I could get those wasted hours back. Never have I played a game where after beating it I feel like it was all a chore with no rewards.",

            "review_text": "Usually I don't discriminate games because of their age but this one is too old, it really is. The game mechanics are completely outdated and having your own economic empire is absolutely laborious since you have to approach every station to receive your money from it.   Back in 1999 when it was released, Xbtf didn't just live from its atmosphere or story telling. The main reason for its success were the advanced trading possibilities that were phenomenal for that time and the fact that you could fly through three dimensional space in a giant universe with also quite good graphics. Nowadays these won't impress anybody anymore.  It's nothing against the game itself but you should better try the other X-series games.",

There is a lot of upgrades and such that you can get for your ship and pirates and other species attack you depending on relations and such. It also has an ever changing economy where some items are in demand in some places than in another. After you get enough credits, you can buy a space station and make more credits or you can buy mining lasers or weapons and become police officers or miners and such. The only thing I can say that's bad about this game is that the graphics are quite dated but nevertheless, still an awesome game! Well worth the money.",
