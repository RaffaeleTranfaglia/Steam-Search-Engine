            "review_text": " (FD: Review copy provided by developer)    Amigdala  just about scrapes a passing mark on account of summoning a consistently grim atmosphere and a solid realisation of a disturbing military facility where skinless terrors from decades gone by go bump in the dark but buyer beware; it is not without its issues.  Based on the real life urban legend of the Philadelphia Experiment, an attempt by the U.S Navy to turn one of its ships invisible that resulted in mass crew insanity and several of them being teleported into the walls, the game plays its survival horror tropes close to home, communicating much of its story through memos and files and leaving you powerless to do anything but flee from the test subjects that lurk around you.  Of course, by 'flee', what I actually mean is 'back away slowly' as you are locked to one ambling speed for the entirety of the experience. While a lack of sprint key in a horror game is not automatically a terrible thing, it does start to feel like a ball and chain when there's as much constant backtracking required as there is here. Even with the sheer amount of save points lying around, death is an exhausting experience as you shuffle to regain lost ground, a particularly irritating example of which is tied to your light sources. Your flashlight requires a constant upkeep of batteries and so you will inevitably come to rely on the lighter to guide you, That is until you wander blindly into one of the game's many gas traps and blow yourself to pieces.   Amigdala  looks lovely and, although I played it on the desktop, I can imagine it would be incredibly immersive in the VR environment it was designed for. Mechanically, it's by-the-numbers; competent enough to wave through for fans of the horror genre but not a particularly convincing argument for it.

It has a very different vibe to it and even though it has vewry few if any jumpscares, i still think that it was an overall okay game. The graphics are pretty great and intensity is extreme. The only think that concerns me a little about this game is the story. I must say tyhat it is a little confusing at some points and i was kind of lost throught the game as there really is no sort of objectives, But overall i reccomend this game and it's worth a try.",

            "review_text": "Disclaimer: I was provided a free key in order ro review the game.   I tried to like this game, but in the end I have to say that I do not recommend it ... right now. I tried a few runs and never made it very far due to bugs, freezing and obstacles that were difficult to move around. I will say from the start that I was playing with mouse and keyboard, while the dev recommends controller. I will re-review the game after I get my controller and try again.   Controller or not, there are bugs and annoying things that ruin the immersion. Right at the beginning of the game, in order to got to the menu and save, you must stand directly in front of the onscreen instruction and press the appropriate button. If you pan the cam too much left, right, up, or down, the instruction will vanish. I do like the idea of onscreen instructions, but I felt in this case it was too finicky to be all that helpful. In addition, whenever you approach a door or item you can pick up, you get the onscreen instruction to do so. In this case, I dislike it. It is fine at the very beginning of the game, but later on there should be a better way to indicate which items can be interacted with. Constant text on the screen really destroys my immersion.   Another bug showed up when I picked up a note and could not put it down. All I could do was spin around, but could not walk or drop the note. I had to force-close the game. I also had multiple times where I had to close the gam because it would not load. I have a fairly decent PC, so I am not so sure that it is a problem on my end.   Bugs aside, there are good points about this game. It looks gorgeous; the graphics are amazing (Unreal Engine). The story (what I got through after the bugs) is great. I am a fan of conspiracy theories, so the story drew me to the game. I am impressed that one person researched the story and made this game on his own. I think with some bug fixes and playing again with a controller, this could be a very good game. I plan to come back after playing with the controller.",
