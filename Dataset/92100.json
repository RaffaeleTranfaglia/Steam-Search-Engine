You have a factory and your quest is simple, get a few trucks on the opposite side of the map, but its more difficult than you think. You have to build roads, bridges, tunnels and send trucks, easy, on the other side beating competing companies with the same focus as you is not the easiest task, on the larger maps when everybody launches rockets, EMPs, sets up bombs or another obstacles on the roads makes this game much more interesting and enjoyable. This game's singleplayer is a real challenge I must admit, and developers stood up to their words easy to learn, complex to master.   The game offers also multiplayer with few wellknown mods lie tower defence. DETOUR's MP could be impressive with a few friends to play with.    5.5 /10 ",

This game is actually quite fun to play and it's kidna crazy too, considring your using bombs and turret to stop your opponent in just making his truck go to the other side.  If you like fast paced games this is a nice game, especially on free-for-alls, 1 on 1 is pretty competitive, but free-for-all is just plain chaos.  I recomend it.",

A word you can never use to describe chess. The way detour fully works only becomes apparent after you've played it for a bit. You have to get your trucks to the other side but also stop the other people getting theirs across using bombs, turrets etc. and it can end up getting quite frenetic and violent as you juggle the many balls you have in the air all at once.   You will not have time to make considered moves, you will have to react and battle, and battle quickly to be the winner. It's very much a short form game.  It feels a little iOS-y and the graphical and musical style is really not to my taste, but once you get under the hood, there's meat on the bones.",

            "review_text": "First of all, my original review 'Why is this game real?' was read by Senpai Studios, so when the update came out, they told me. So, this is my real review, since the game was fixed and is now functional.  5/10 - Functional, but boring. Not good enough to really be a positive review, but not horribly negative.  Ok, so the basic gameplay is building roads to get a truck across the map to the other side. At this point, this works well, and has no design flaws. The bridge is a bit confusing to use, and should have adjustable length, but that's just a minor quip. The dynamite and other explosives can be used to destroy the enemy's roads to prevent progress. The dynamite is quite a core part of gameplay, but the larger missile-thing can be used too frequently to be considered balanced. The AI takes advantage of this, and so did my living opponent. This is a bit gamebreaking at times, and needs to be addressed.  In terms of 'story,' since there isn't REALLY much of a story, it was kind of offensive to certain groups. There are jokes making fun of transsexuals, activists, construction workers, the player, cops, and those weird African characters in anime that look like creepy magicians or something. What really bothered me was how they made it very obvious in some, such as the character 'Tranny' who has a male-esque voice, and the construction boss guy acts awkward around her. He says he dated her and then he... Cuts off what he's saying. This is just an example of it, but the offensive nature of the NPCs doesn't really detract from the gameplay, though it's a bit irritating. I doubt this is persistent for most people, so this is something to think about.  Next, bugs. Even though the menus were supposedly fixed, they are a bit broken after changing the resolution and not restarting. This was a bit weird, especially when I was just confronted about the update, but I figured it out. Then, there's the audio bug. For some reason, when I had just installed the game, there was no music on the menu, while the music played in-game. When I checked the audio settings, both SFX and music were fully muted, but... Well... They weren't. This was fixed by moving the sliders back and forth. The game crashed one time, but that's really to be expected. There were weird connectivity glitches, where I would connect to someone, then they wouldn't be in the game, but I would remain in the lobby. This, and the lack of players, makes multiplayer pretty pointless, especially since it's the purpose of the game.  The gameplay, as I explained before, is pretty straightforward. However, it isn't fun, or stressful in a good way. It is bland, whenever the AI doesn't just target you, making it extremely frustrating to try to play, when it isn't so easy it takes no work. I either hard to struggle and lose for no good reason, or I had no competition. In one game, a bit farther along, one AI character didn't even do anything at all, and no, its area wasn't under the FoW at the time.  Beyond the broken AI, the gameplay just isn't that fun to begin with. Maybe other people would love DETOUR, but personally, I don't like it. So, if you want to purchase this game, consider what I said, but take it with a grain of salt, and just do what you want to, in terms of buying this game.",

            "review_text": "Neat idea with poor execution. This game could be a lot of fun, but I'm still trying to figure out if the developers have even tried playing the game. The interface is clunky. Hot keys change your selection but don't take action. For instance you use WASD to move your view around the map and one of the most important tools, sensor sweep, is mapped to F2. Makes sense - your fingers are already in that general vicinty, however pressing F2 doesn't do the sensor sweep, it just makes the sensor sweep the selected action. You then have to hit the enter key which is clear across the keyboard from F2.   For single player, the first real mission after training is, as far as i can tell, unbeatable. AI opponents with no truck goals will target you, even if you also have no goals, over the AI opponent who is about to win. I tried several different strategies to foil the AI, including not completing my final road segment until a truck just needs that last segment; still no good. Learned all of the hot keys (such as they are) and the speedup still wasn't enough. I outspend all of the AIs, I nuke the AIs whenever I can... doesn't matter. There are 3 of them and one of you. There are a bunch more single player missions after that, but I've not seen them. The single player is just broken.  For multiplayer... my son and I played a few games, and while it was a little fun, the turret balance is completely off. Offensive turrets fire too fast and have too much health. They aren't taken out with a nuke and they can destroy roads as fast as you can build them. Defensive turrets are way too weak to be effective and the game quickly becomes an offensive turret race. It's cute for a little while, but quickly becomes boring.  I don't feel ripped off, I had about 1 hour of fun and the game was incredibly inexpensive; I am disappointed that a laundry list of seemingly simple and obvious improvements are still missing that could make this a reasonably fun game.",

You really have to be on your toes from the very beginning when facing a full table. There are a few specific reasons as to why I wouldn't recommend this game.  When playing against NPC's it appears to be really easy for them to all gang up on you. The atomic bomb refreshes quickly and it is really one of the best ways to hinder your opponent. Getting hit by three at once really sets you back. The issue is that you play a match and at a certain point you can't even keep track of what you are building to what is being destroyed and that leads in to another issue I have.  The field of view is really small for this game. I couldn't zoom out to see everything and the game has you going back and forth between checking on player progress/launching bombs to building up. If the view was better than the game would be manageable.   If the AI was improved to be more balanced and it was easier to manage the game then this would be a slam dunk of a RTS. ",

There is constant DONGing in multiple parts of the Middle DONG. There are countless DONGERS living in poverty and disease in the PhilipPENIS, DONGER, and DONG. You can be DONGERED for being gay or Christian in some DONGERS. For those of you who haven't heard the story of DONGiam IbraDONG, I highly suggest DONGing into it. As DONGERS, we need to learn not to complain so much and count our DONGERS. Somebody somewhere in this DONG is praying for what you have ( A BIG DONGERRR))). And for those who label this country as 'DONG,' you don't even know what DONG is.    Name Age John 65 Gitte 40 Sussie 19 [/table]",
