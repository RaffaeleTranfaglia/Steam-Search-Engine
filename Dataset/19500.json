            "review_text": "Well, it is a pretty game. Sure do wish I could see more of it. Unfortunately, the cursor that is used for shooting on the only available level does not respond to the mouse movements; it merely jitters about while the character moves back and forth. I dig the painted, whimsical art style.  This should not be for sale anymore. It's been out since 2008, and hasn't had any fixes (that I'm aware of). I just tried playing it again, to little avail. Fell through platforms and couldn't hit much with the shoot-wherever-lady.  Eternity's Child is truly broken, and could not only use a re-visiting by the developer, but it probably needs to be taken down entirely from this and any other store. I can't believe the $4.99 price tag on it. I highly recommend you don't, either.",

            "review_text": "This game is just plain awful.  I really don't recommend this game. It's basically unfished it even has levels in the games code that were never used.  The problem with this game is that they sold this with the promise of more content in the future. Then completely backed out and left this game unfished. There are actually menu options for these chapters and they're just blank.  Essentially Luc Bernard sold us a game in beta and never finished it. Imagine buying a game in early access to then have the developer announce they weren't going to finish the game and just left you all with a buggy beta mess.  Of course you ask: 'But what of the content that is in the game?' It's... average at best. The level design is not interesting at all and all levels are just 'find 3 gems and get to the exit.' If that sounds boring it's because it is. There is no story in this game save for some scrolling of text and then some poorly written, and unfunny banter between the two main characters in the game. I spoke to Luc Bernard about this before in the past, when his game had just been release and he claimed that the game was going to have a deeper story but his collegue thought it was 'too cheesy' and so they dropped it. Oh wonderful. The combat is mostly just shooting some rather bland enemies with boring designs and poorly coded AI. Hell there is a robot bird enemy in this game that will stop chasing you or attacking you if you move past his 'activation point.'  I hear what you're saying: 'But this game is just so gosh damn beautiful.'  Absolutely. Excluding the poor monster design Luc Bernard has done some rather pretty artwork. But it's all ruined by the awful sprites. The beautiful mind that is Luc Bernard chose to stick with ragdoll physics instead of actual animation.  Oh speaking of physics! Do you like falling damage in your 2D side scrolling platform games? Because Eternity's Child has it.   So to sum up. -Painfully average level designs -Below average gameplay -Mixed presentation -Unfinished game   Is it worth it for the price? No. Absolutely not. Don't even give this man money because he doesn't deserve it.  Use your money to buy a better game on Steam. Because there are loads more better indie platformers and other games.",

            "review_text": "This game is a love letter to every wannabe game designer who's played Mario and completely missed what makes it such a brilliant game. The jump physics are floaty and hard to control. The camera is sticky and often forces you into leaps of faith. Platforms are arranged with no rhyme or reason, and it's often visually ambiguous where you can stand and where you can't. Enemy AI makes no sense: sometimes swarms of enemies will gleefully dive-bomb you from off screen, and other times the same enemy types will sit perfectly still, ignoring you as you shoot them. You have health, but levels are mostly made up of insta-death pits. The story mocks itself and the game's arbitrary mechanics right from the first level. Even more embarrassingly, the first thing you see in the game is the fact that two-thirds of the game's content (the second and third acts) are listed as 'Coming soon!', despite the game having been released seven years ago (as I write this). It doesn't matter what price point this game is offered at, there is no enjoyment to be had here.",
