            "review_text": "Metal Planet is a MP shooter in the vain of the classic Unreal Tournament games. Players are split into two teams and dropped into a map, with the goal of capturing all the spawn points and killing off the other team until they can no longer spawn back. For all it takes from the classic Unreal games however, it loses absolutely all the polish, balance, and addictive quality that made those such timeless shooters, leaving you with a buggy and confusing menagerie of incomplete mechanics and unpolished design.  The largest issue with Metal Planet is how absolutely unintuitive everything about it manages to be. The simple task of firing weapons and using abilities are never explained or even hinted at, leaving you to fumble about on the keyboard hitting buttons in the hope they do something (the outcome of which is even more confounding). Should you figure out what the various skills do, matches quickly divulge into a completely unbalanced back and forth of who can stun the other person first. It's frustrating and dull at the best of times, and completely destroys any hope of an even match.  I would like to say there's some hidden quality, some element of Metal Planet that keeps it a flawed but sometimes enjoyable gem, but there really isn't. Every aspect of the game is entirely ripped from other games, then melted down into an almost unrecognizable mess of broken and unenjoyable mechanics (not to mention the obnoxious visuals and single audio track). If I hadn't been playing with a group of friends I doubt I would have lasted more than a few minutes with this pile of rubbish (not that I could have, given the community is entirely dead), and would advise you to give it the widest of berths.",
