            "review_text": "WOW! Really one of my best experiences for the vive and i have seen a lot. After over 3 months with the vive now i did not think that anything will amaze me again like at the start. but this... just wow.  Yes, it is short.  Yes, it is quite expencive.  But i enjoyed every single second of this journey and will keep it in my heart :) i espescially liked the small things in the game with the different (small) interactions. And it's quite nice that you are often placed in the corner of the room so you can walk across 2 or 3 meters. And of course the visuals with great background music.  I will absolutly show this to my friends just like theblu.  So if you have the money then it's easy 10/10",

It looks stunning on a 1080 with super sampling turned up.   Just be aware that this is not a game in the traditional sense but is in my view worth every penny. I expect that experiences like this are what will make VR mainstream in the future.",

This is not your average polygon based space ping-pong VR game that has zero assets.  It's a photorealistic experience of being on Mt Everest and it does its job superbly.  Yes, it's short, but whatever you experience during that time is absolutely worth the money.  Think of it this way: how much would you pay to take your family on a 30-min IMAX experience of Mt Everest? This costs less than that and is a LOT more immersive.",

            "review_text": "So far a pinneacle of VR immersive experience . It's not a game, just a simulation where you do few steps, some short walk and climbing and it all takes 30 - 40 minutes max. Graphics is amazing indeed, no lags, absolutely seamless even having max setup (i7 Skylake Extreme 4.3GHz/ nVidia 980Ti/ 16MB/ Win10Pro 64). Your action perimeter is very, very limited.  Flip side of the coin is that will hardly play it again as the whole simulation is strictly build on linear script. 'Rollercoaster effect' is obvious: first ride is breath taking, second one still great but the 3rd one is a boredom. Not sure if great value for your money if worth of solid blockbuster regular game. Such stuff should come for free as a technology demo for Unreal Engine. I hope that makers will make some further extensions to spice &amp; season more action in it. Must recommend YES as a VR fan and geek, if you expect gaming experience then blame yourself - you have been warned.",

The overall effect is good, and some of the detail works really well, but this is something to experience early in your VR career rather than after hours of gameplay. As it is, the interactive segments are very short and don't fit together well. There is good variety in day and night scenes, and some small parts which are really good - but plan to spend 30 minutes watching a short documentary, then decide if the price is right for you (compared with all those failed Kickstarters, its not a bad purchase)",

There is much not used potential in this game, like having more climing and so on. more than 50% of this 20 minuits or so is loading time and flythroughs. If i wanted that there some (free) 4k videos on youtube which will to just alike.  I really can't recommend this game as its not a full game. I've played longer demos (Brookhaven e.g.).",

The tutorial shows you some stuff to do, but yet each is used once and is not any fun. The experience is quick, and half of it is spent towering over the mountain like in a helicopter with a narrator telling you stuff that isn't very helpful.   At the current price of $25, this needs to have a lot more involved in order to be worth it. Have us use our skills for climbing multiple objects, multiple ladders, making our way up the mountain slowly but surely. Make it seem adventurous - I felt like the entire climb would be incredibly easy to make when it really isn't. The visuals are there and there shouldn't need to be much extra work done for the environment, just in expanding the tasks. I want to work to climb Mt. Everest  As it is now, the game shouldn't be priced more than $10, just like The Blu, as it's basically the same thing. Add in more to the game for the price tag. I might repurchase once it hits $10, but I can't recommend.",
