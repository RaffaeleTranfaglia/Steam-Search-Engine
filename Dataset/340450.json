All levels are accessable from the start so you don't get blocked if you cannot get through a tricky level. The later levels have some fun with proceedural generatiion and it works pretty well. Would benefit from adding steam achievements - especially if they take into account which control mode you use.",

            "review_text": "Good ideas. Mediocre physics gameplay. Terrible presentation.   The basic premise is solid. Using your Lunar lander, land on platforms in sequence as quickly as possible while trying to avoid collision damage which will make you explode. There are a lot of good ideas in the levels which vary from landing on moving platforms to flying through consecutive rigs, to finding hidden areas to navigating very tight spaces. Its enough to keep it realatively interesting. The downside is the camera which runs into issues in tigh spaces and the sheer pointless scale of the levels. In some levels the game has you traveling very long distances for no aparent reason.   Where the game really falls off is the presentation. While the basic craft is quite functional, its visually uninteresting and has no clear front, back or sides. The majority of the levels are built from ambiguous shapes and poorly built random models that make no cohesive sense. The lack of clearly reccognizable scale elements makes it difficult to tell where you are, where you have been and how far things are at times.   If you are a big fan of physics puzzles and lunar lander style games, its worth picking up on sale. For anyone else, I would avoid this game.",
