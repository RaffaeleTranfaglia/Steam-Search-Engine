            "review_text": "Personal Rating: Wasted Classic Rating: ★★★★☆  Spate is the story of a man who lost his family and became addicted to drinking; it's a surreal trip in search for answers which probably are not going to be found. It's a story about love, though, without any doubt.  About the technical aspects of the game, I had some problem related to low framerate but i was still able to play it; moreover i found an issue about preferences not being saved - subtitles were set to off every time i quit the game and my XBOX 360 controller was working half-way.. i could move but couldn't use any buttons until i mapped them: then again i lost those settings after a Windows restart and had to re-map those buttons.  Big thanks to Eric (game developer) for your kind support and my best wishes for your next projects.",

One interesting thing about it is that you can drink portions of absinthe, which enhances your jumping ability and changes the visuals of the game, making it feel like a bit of a psychedelic trip.

            "review_text": "So like with my last review, I came upon this game when I was browsing my way too big steam library. Incidentally I had seen this before, and put it on my list of one of those interesting looking indie games, with a nice artsyle. The fact that I had gotten it from somewhere had completely gone over my head, until I saw it on my list. I guess I must have gotten it in one of the many bundles I have bought over the time. Anyway..  Spate is a side-scrolling platformer, and my first impression was that it reminded me a lot of Limbo, wich is a very good thing. This might just be because they are both sidescrolling platformers, with a cool artsyle, but I think the whole feel of the game was very much like Limbo, and not like, for instance Megaman wich is, incidentally also a sidescrolling platformer. The characters movement was pretty solid, if a little sloppy. I wouldn't say this game has top-notch twitch-action controlls, but they are merely good, and works very well with this game.   The level design wasn't that good, the puzzles wasn't that challenging, and more often than not, the game would have wide distances with nothing going on, other than the narrator filling in a piece of story, or some wierd visuals going on. Personally I don't have a big problem with this, because I'm not the best at platforming, and I'm especially not that patient, so I tend to give up if the puzzles are too hard. The fact that it was pretty easy, and there was these 'empty' sections, gave more space for the story to grow. There was however some points that were pretty fricking frustrating, at one point the game kept on killing me for incorrectly landing on some platforms, meanwhile the jumpy things bugged and died, meaning I had to restart the section to make it work. Another place would be right at the end *SPOILER ALERT* where you have to climb a tower to get to the end of the game, and it uses a mechanic that levitates you upwards, while you have to dodge saws and stuff, if you die at any point while flying you will start back at the bottom, and will have to fly up again, and it takes a long time to fly up.  The story was pretty great. The setting of the game had this whole Zeno Clash style wich I absolutely adore, and the story was a gloomy one about a man with a lot of problems. The whole thing matched nicely into the setting, and even managed to justify the wierd things, in a way that makes the player think for them selves. I think this part of the game, the whole story and setting thing, was by far the best executed thing in this game, and is defenitly the main selling point in my opinion.   The artstyle was pretty cool, as I already mentioned, it uses the wierd Zeno Clash esque style, and combines it with a grimy but colourful pallette (yea both of those things, at the same time, go figure), and often uses wierd camera angles, and effects, in a non-intrusive or gamebraking way, to effectuate the whole drinking thing.  Overall Spate is pretty good, but is also very short. I beat the game in one setting in less than two hours. So with a pricetag of 9.99 eur, I would say you'd probably want to pick it up at a sale, or buy it in a bundle. If you are a stickler for great stories, you might be able to justify the price.  Tl;dr: Great story, great visuals, great setting, very short, a little pricy. Buy on sale!",

            "review_text": "I was one of the backers for Spate.   The gameplay itself is very simple. This game would be better described as a narrative visual book than a platformer. I was unimpressed with the gameplay all together, but for some reason I couldn't stop playing. This is one of the most immersive games I've ever played. The rain, the visuals, the music, the narration, everything is bound together perfectly. Even the ability to take a drink and disorient yourself for an ability of jumping higher, which is mostly useless, brings you further in. The ending is strong and for the sake of not ruining anything, I won't comment further on it.  I once said to a friend of mine that, gameplay be damned, a solid story can make a game become amazing. Spate is evidence of that. The game will not take you long to beat; a couple hours at most, but this is a worthwhile game.",

            "review_text": "Spate is a weird game.  Far more on the side of an artistic experience, more atmospheric and narrative driven, rather than a game with solid mechanics that you need to learn in order to overcome various obstacles.  This by itself might put a lot of people off, as the game bundles itself with Dear Esther, Gone Home, Limbo, Braid, etc. I would definitely not pair it with Limbo and Braid. Those games had more focus on the mechanics, regardless of having just as big of an artistic approach to it.  But, I certainly enjoyed Spate. I wouldn't consider it as good as most other attempts at art-sy games, but it certainly had a few great moments!   In Spate, you're an alcoholic father, who has 'lost' his little girl. You're in a twisted, dream-like land (it reminded me quite a lot of Alice Madness Returns, in a good way) in search for answers. You, and your absynthe.  And because of that, you don't know what is real, and what is not. You don't know what's actually true, or what you've hallucinated in this weird world. And that's part of its charm.    Visually , the game is beautiful, without a lot of strange creatures, and a world that makes you feel tiny and insignificant right from the beginning.  The game is also very heavy on effects, and camera movements, so beware if you get motion sickness easily.  All in all, I really like the look of the game, and trying to figure out exactly where the hell I was. A big issue, is that it performs terribly. The developer is actively trying to make it better, but it still runs pretty badly, even in very good rigs.  I played at probably 30-45 fps and it didn't really impact the gameplay too much, but a smoother experience would be much better.  The  music  was actually phenomenal! It was one of the high points for me. It has a sad feel to it, and very heavy, actually (Not in a heavy metal way, but created a very heavy atmosphere), and it was beautiful. It was fairly minimalistic, but it worked perfectly. I'm not sure if it was influenced by the players actions, but it always hit the spot for me, with its intensity.  I'm very impressed with both graphic and sound design in this game, both beautifully crafted!   Now, how was gameplay?  Well, pretty weak, for the most part. It seemed more of a vehicle for the narrative, but just ended up feeling a bit too empty in that regard. You jump and run to the right, for the most part, with some soft platforming. A few saws here and there, some somewhat precise platforming, but there was hardly any challenge. As there shouldn't be, taken how the game was designed. It's more of a walk, enjoying the world and its looks, trying to answer the questions it brings. There were also 2 sequences where you were in a flying boat, that played a bit like flappy bird (with good maneuvering space, not unfair or anything) to keep the game fresh, but it felt out of place, and a very artificial way to keep things interesting.  Then, there was the main mechanic, directly tied to the narrative. You can take a sip at your absynthe. That'll make the world even more surreal, making you dazy, but will also make you run faster and jump higher (perhaps a bit how you would feel, like it's a weight off your back, ready to face the world). You could easily beat the game without drinking anything. But you could also drink a lot, like the drunk you are! And, while they may not matter in what the game does later on, it serves as your own story. In this case, the path, and not the final goal.  There were a couple of great moments where I myself felt inclined to drink (or not to), as my own interpretation of what was happening, and that's also something I didn't expect, but was very cool.  The whole game is narrated by you (the character), about how things got where they are. About all that went wrong. About losing your daughter, your wife, and now your life, to the alcohol. It's up to your whether or not you try not to drink, or just drink to forget. While great in concept, it didn't quite feel as significant as it could have been, as it changes nothing, in the end (And I don't think that was the point, although it could certainly be a valid interpretation). The game has 2 endings, I believe, but they're not based on your actions , it's more of a binary choice in the last sequence of the game. And that was very disappointing. I feel that much more could have been done with the theme.    I liked the narrative of the game, I've found it fairly enjoyable, and has you questioning reality, life, misery, all within a very surreal looking world. The gameplay, on the other hand, isn't as tied to it as it should. But hey, it's not too bad. The game is pretty short (most people finish it in 90minutes to 2 hours) for one playthrough, and the binary nature of the choice lacks replayability. Despite thinking the game has still a huge room for improvement, I still liked it, for what it is. It's a beautiful walk in the park, structured more as a short film than as a game, but still worth trying out if you're into these kinds of games.  Wait for a sale if you think it's too short for 10$, but it's certainly an interesting one.",

            "review_text": "Having completed the game now (in about 90 mins), I'd say this is a decent atmospheric indie platformer. A lot of colorful backgrounds, eerie symbolisms and a certain amount of intrigue.  However, when I got to the end, I frankly expected more than just to complete the game. No boss battle, or some somewhat challenging puzzle to solve? Or more to add to the story?  The voice acting wasn't enchanting at all. In fact, I kinda wished there was no voice-acting in the game. It felt way too jarring, the way there would be just the background music then suddenly somebody narrating. And there was no cohesion whatsoever to the story.  Imagine if the voice acting was done in the same vein as Thomas Was Alone (or even Bastion). The narrator there has a brilliant voice, and it never felt jarring even once. Story was slowly built, and character bond created, via the narration.  The voice acting/narration in Thomas Was Alone single-handedly made the game so memorable. Or else, it would have remained a freeware game on some free flash website.  In addition to that, too much time was spent just pointlessly going to the right, dropping down rivers and jumping up stairs. While I agree a game like this should not have too much (and too difficult) precision platforming, there was so much room for better puzzles though.  And what was with the cave sections where you fly the ship? Felt completely pointless and out of place.  In the end, while I say this game is decent, it is not particularly something that has enchanted me as so many indie atmospheric platformers before this (Thomas Was Alone, The Swapper, and even Brothers, which is admittedly not a platformer). I personally did not connect to the character, and the story was lost on me. Gameplay was too sparse.  Really, this is probably the first 2d walking sim I have played.  As a singular developer, the dev may have been so consumed by his work that the flaws or rather weak-points may have gone unnoticed to him. Or perhaps, I just missed the point of the game.  Regardless, it is a brave try. Artistically, the game looks good, though the dev really needs to work on optimizing the game. Framerate dropped by more than 50% in around 10 scenes in the game, and a further 10 times I got freezes that lasted 5 seconds.  It is hard to recommend this game, but then again, it would be harsher still to rate it as not recommended'. As for the price, maybe yeah I kinda regret getting it on release, but when it goes 50 or 75% off, it should be more palatable for what is offered.",

Also I'm sad that I lost my wife and child.' repeated about 30 times with different wordings. The ending bashes you in the face with symbolism that would make an English teacher proud. 'Climbing this tower represents his struggle with alcoholism. The boss at the end sustains his life by feeding off the souls of those around him, just like the main character destroys those around him with his alcoholism.'   The platforming bits are alright, but nothing particularly special. And though it might seem petty, I really didn't like the narrator's 1920's New Yorker accent - just didn't seem to fit the character at all.

It lacks interesting elements to keep a steady flow of attentiveness and enjoyment. There were some very interesting parts, such as entering through the first odd creature. As it went along I thought 'wow, i'm a little intimidated to go through this part/go inside this area. What'll happen if I do?' well, what happened was that I literally just walked through it, without any action or consequence. This game isn't terrible, don't get me wrong...But another problem with it, is that the controls are clunky. It feels like your character's slightly off in certain situations. There were a few times when I had a checkpoint and died. Not so hard, right? You get sent back to the checkpoint when you die-well, when you've went through a series of 6-8 obstacles and a narrow passageway just to slam right into the same upper wall the billionth time JUST because you didn't hold the space bar in just the right timing makes respawning very agonizing. There were very few other parts where I just sat there and said to myself 'I wonder if i'm going to get through this anytime soon.' because it was just so clunky and absurd. I go on a jump panel, and somehow I die....I jump towards a paltform, miss my jump, glitch in the segment holding up the platform and instantaneously die. The difficulty in this game is just aggravating. For the most part, it's easy sailing, you just work your way through, and to an extent it gets boring. Then, when you come to a more difficult part, that's not even that difficult in concept....You keep dying, or falling back to start, over and over and over again. It's not the fact that you die that makes it difficult; in fact, dying wasn't a concern...It's falling back right to where you started. It happens very solemn in this game, but when it does.....It's pretty aggravating. The narration is excellent, the story is very well done. If it's on sale and you just...Want to find a way to kill time, or if it looks interesting to you, go ahead and get it...But if I was recommending this to people who're looking for a triple A game, i'd tell them to pass on this.",

The story as it stands has as much to say about addiction as a potato has to say about geopolitics.

The unrecorded dialogue is also amateurish and silly.  Your character, supposedly an alcoholic detective, looks and controls more like a rough draft of Octodad - and that actually provides most of the challenges given the unimaginative platforming involved. The drinking mechanic is interesting, but only half baked in this context of this game.  The result as a whole is a garbled mess.
