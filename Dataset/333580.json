It is simple and fun and the levels can increseinglly become challengeing. It is a fun casual game to play after intense CS:GO or something similier.  I have enjoyed the time that i speant on it and those who buy it are also supporting a good charity as well.  Now as a personal request, can we have Sunset Overdrive and Ratchet and Clank?",
