The game design and universe is creative, colorful and the universe is set in a magical medieval time. The music and characters are appealing and varied, and even though you're (mostly) playing as a malevolent king, you will cry not from sadness, but from laughter.  I played this several years ago, and I've been looking for it ever since. I finally found it when Ceville was on sale previously this year.  Highly recommended.",

Humour is okay, the story is okay, the gameplay is okay, so is voice acting, graphics etc... and yet for some reason it's just very boring after a short while. Maybe adventure games fans will enjoy it more than I did, but I would not recommend Ceville to anyone because it simply can't hold one's interest.",

Essentially it is a point and click to interact style adventure, but to me boredom is more fitting than adventure. Unless you like very subtle video games I wouldn't recommend it.",

            "review_text": "short version: corny, fun, and recommended when on sale  longer version: i don’t usually play point and clicks but i managed to make my way through this one with a couple of looks at a walkthrough and i enjoyed the theme and feel of the game. you play a somewhat incompetent evil ex-ruler who is trying to get back to power but is acompnied with a stereotypically sweet little girl  . you play the 'bad guy' of a medieval fairy tail . the humor isn’t high brow. the jokes are corny and you will find many stereotypes (i personally liked most of the jokes tho) . graphics weren’t particularly good even for 2009, but the colourful cartoony aesthetic means it is not an eyesore either . most puzzles were reasonably challenging but not impossible (for a person who isn’t very experienced in the genre) . did not crash but suffered some frame rate loss at times (2012, 32bit vista) . sound and music felt generic but adequate . should entertain you for 5-8 hours . not mechanically innovative, the game introduces nothing to add to the genre that hasn’t been done before  finally: this is a point and click game, with all the good and bad the genre has to offer. you point and you click. you trial and you error. you find the right combination of objects to use which don’t usually make sense from a realistic point of view. Ive seen people somteimes give bad reviews to games because they don’t like the genre. i dont particularly enjoy point and clicks and this game didnt exactly change my point of view, but i think it does an adequate job at what it is attempting",
