            "review_text": "  MEMENTO: ~~~~~~~~~   The girls of “Saint Cattleya High School” arrived on Future Island for a school excursion. This is a small Island scarred by a past war. In the middle of a still delightful natural garden setting lies the War Museum, where letters and other objects from the terrible events which occurred on this Island are on display. During a break, Miss Shizuru felt dizzy in the Museum and passed out! As she woke up, she found herself in the same place, but in an alternative world where relics of the past war are now petrifying monsters. How are you going to go back to your time, my dear Shizuru?  Memento is a 2D pixel/adventure/RPG/horror game where you play Shizuru, a high school student from Saint Cattleya High School. You will start the game at the pier with your colleague schools mates. As you venture around the island and the museum, you will quickly find out that this place has something strange about it, which becomes immediately obvious when you are chased by giant bees in the museum while trying to find a way out!   You might scratch your head here and there (I certainly did) when you look at the combination of 2D Graphics and horror game. However, Memento has several aspects that gel the combination very well. First is the story, which jumps from a present world to an alternate world. The second aspect is the dialogues which keep you entertained as you go forward into the story. The third part is the scary aspect of the game where you will be chased or need to avoid strange monsters which are a combination of war engineering vehicles/animals and others. It will take you by surprise more than once and you might find yourself stuck for a while in a certain location or situation.  You will be able to save your progress in Memento Via crosses. Just bear in mind that crosses can be embedded on pictures or within the natural floral environment. If you see one, make sure to save your game straight away. You will meet another character as you go along, and she will be able to help you with your quest.  Personally, I find Memento a very interesting and enjoyable game to play. Good 2D graphics, great story with scary moments. The atmosphere is well portrayed especially when you have to run to avoid a monster. I would like to have more obvious save points.   Positives: ~~~~~~~    - Good Story  - Good 2D Graphics - Interesting Monsters - Trading cards  Negatives: ~~~~~~~~   - Some save point might not be that obvious - No achievements  This is a very interesting pixel/adventure/ horror game with good dialogues. Definitely a game to own!  7.5/10  Key provided by developer/publisher for review purposes. Any opinions expressed are entirely my own!
