            "review_text": "This game has cartoon, brightly primary colored cats. They ride around on colored tracks you build. If you build the tracks right, the cats fly off into space, thus keeping the Earth from going off orbit and killing us all. All of this is underscored with a zippy, upbeat soundtrack that is oddly infectious on its own.  This might lead a casual observer to conclude that this is simplistic game targeted towards children. That observer would be wrong. The puzzles seem like they would be straight forward enough. You can see the trains of kitties that will have to navigate the machine you must build. So just build colors of tracks that match the kitties that must ride them. Simple? Not so much after the first few puzzles. I got stumped four or five puzzles in. Solved a few more puzzles, since the game progression isn't completely linear and that is an option. My brain grew a bit smarter at this, and I was able to go back and finish the one that stopped me. As much as I like the soundtrack, I soon disabled it to better focus on the mentally engaging gameplay.  The answers aren't always obvious, at least to someone with my brainpower. Still, the puzzles do seem doable. It's refreshing to find a puzzle game mechanic that straddles the line between challenging and thought provoking without crossing over to exasperation. All with a cheerfully looney premise, adorable oddly colored cats, and a lighthearted cheerful soundtrack that bring capital letter 'F' fun.  About the only negative criticism I can really think of right now is that there really is only just the puzzle build aspect of this game. As far as I can tell no score is kept, solving the puzzles and progressing to the next one is it's own reward. There are, I dunno, 50-ish levels I believe? I'm not looking forward to the day I run out of them. Hopefully in the future there will be some DLC with more puzzles. Also. it would be super if there were steam workshop support so that players could create share puzzles with the community.    All in all this is a very nice little title that seems worth the price. If you like puzzle games I doubt that you'll be disapointed with this one.   8/10",

Once you create a sequence of train tracks that match the color-coded cats, you can hear the satisfaction of cats meowing and floating out into space. The music is VERY familiar.",

This game contains everything one would want in life:  -Cats -Meows -Difficult and thought-provoking puzzles -Funny, slightly self-aware and sarcastic jokes about cats and science -More cats  In all seriousness, though, go and buy this game. If you like puzzlers and humour, I promise you will not be disappointed.",

But then the puzzles turned out to be very interesting and cleverly designed with a few levels that are genuine head-scratchers. The whimsical backstory is a plus, but the level design is what kept me playing till the end.  I only wish that there were more levels. This is actually a game I would gladly pay for a DLC if it added just more of the same.  Also, have I mentioned the cats?",
