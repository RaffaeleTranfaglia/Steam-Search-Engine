            "review_text": "Celia's Quest is a RPG not focused on leveling, grinding and becoming the best – but rather, a RPG where the main focus is exploration while completing various quests and solving puzzles to get stronger. A game that's about finding a 'build' that suits you to clear the game. There are many variations ranging from the classics to unique setups. Mix and match and see what build you prefer, and what works out! There are many NPC's in Celia's Quest with rich backgrounds, and a series of dialogues between characters that'll make you chuckle on more than several occasions due to the creators witty senses.  In short; Celia's Quest is a game that offers unique gameplay elements that most RPG genre lacks nowdays. A gameplay that's refreshing from the occasional 'grind until you can't grind anymore' games out there.",
