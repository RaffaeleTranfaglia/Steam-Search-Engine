Warning: This game can become rather addicting, even though it's a very small game. I went from 5 hours to 20 to 40 and it's just so easy to get caught in it.  Protips: Mess around with loadouts, it's hilarious and can get you to the top of the leaderboard for the match. You can change your stickmans color in the options (hint hint Camoflauge) I was told you stop getting weapons at lvl 80 (makes sense, gonna see for myself.)  Personal favorites: Bow+sword, and double revolvers, kunai+double knives, suicide vest or kunai or boomerang and any of these loadouts with it.

You will have to realize like any other game as this be, will have some-what hack-cheaters, and real-deal smart hackers come and go. Some will hijack your server by cracking your code, and your server be stoled. I have played this before and after, and been in this 1-in-a-half year ago. Seen a poor player being hijacked and not be able get it back ever and felt sad for and with him on that issue. PvP is never good anymore these years and wars in streets after the election. Sh*t will never be the same no more. PvE in single player &amp; with Cooperative play-style is always the best and gives best respects and careness, without hatred from PvP sh*t every f**kin time when so. This is an Up &amp; down than a recommendation of this game. Private server is best for a start, so you can find and hope for an trusted person and more than one to join in the party.",

This would have been my favorite game 5-6 years ago, now it's a great addition to my steam collection. And it's free.  PROS:  - Tons of replayability with tons of weapons and maps (with a map editor) - Play with your steam friends online, no hassle or annoying account creation - Freemium, and premium does NOT give any gameplay advantages! - Lots of servers and generally a good amount of players - Runs on basically any computer, no fancy system required. - Lore and ♥♥♥♥ for those interested  CONS:  - Fullscreen resolution is disturbing, or play in windowed mode and suffer - Lots of TCP Errors, minor annoyance, just try and reconnect it usually works the 2nd or 3rd time  OVERALLl: 75/100  Fix the resolution issues and TCP Errors and this will easily be 90/100. Nothing else really to complain about. I don't know how hard it would be to allow friend invites from within the game?  Anyways, get the game and try it for 10 minutes. Unlock some guns. If you don't like the game, delete it, no risk or loss. However, if you're like me, you will play this more than 90% of your other Steam games on a regular basis.",
